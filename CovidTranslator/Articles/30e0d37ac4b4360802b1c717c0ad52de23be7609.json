            "text": "Vaccines are biological preparations that improve immunity to particular diseases and form an important innovation of 19th century research. It contains a protein that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weak or killed forms of the microbe. Vaccines are agents that stimulate the body's immune system to recognize the antigen. Now, a new form of vaccine was introduced which will have the power to mask the risk side of conventional vaccines. This type of vaccine was produced from plants which are genetically modified. In the production of edible vaccines, the gene-encoding bacterial or viral disease-causing agent can be incorporated in plants without losing its immunogenic property. The main mechanism of action of edible vaccines is to activate the systemic and mucosal immunity responses against a foreign diseasecausing organism. Edible vaccines can be produced by incorporating transgene in to the selected plant cell. At present edible vaccine are developed for veterinary and human use. But the main challenge faced by edible vaccine is its acceptance by the population so that it is necessary to make aware the society about its use and benefits. When compared to other traditional vaccines, edible vaccines are cost effective, efficient and safe. It promises a better prevention option from diseases.",

            "text": "The greatest achievement of the 19 th century was the development of vaccines. The first vaccine to be developed was small pox vaccine by Edward Jenner in 1796 and the work was later continued by Louis Pasteur [1] . The spread of infectious diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles mumps rubella and hepatitis was reduced by the administration of vaccines [2, 3] . Our immune system destroys disease-causing germs that we call as pathogens and protects our body from their invasion. If our immune system is not strong enough to fight against the invading pathogens definitely we will get infectious diseases. There comes the importance of vaccination. An antigenic substance prepared from the causative agent of a disease or a synthetic substitute, used to provide immunity against one or several diseases is known as vaccines and the process of administration of vaccines is called vaccination [1] . Vaccines can be prophylactic or therapeutic depending upon the need. When the prophylactic vaccines prevent infections, therapeutic vaccines help to prevent complications of chronic infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and HPV by boosting the immune system and are still under investigation [4] . The three main vaccine production methods are the cell-based vaccines, vaccines developed by investigational manufacturing system and egg-based vaccines [5] . In common, the production of vaccines comprises of four main steps including propagation, isolation, purification, and formulation. Propagation is the multiplication of the living organism used in vaccine.",

Purification is the process of removing unwanted substances mainly the vulnerable ones from the selected living organism for vaccine production. Then, the last step is formulation, in this the purified organism is formulated to vaccine by the addition of suitable preservatives if needed [5, 6] . Conventional vaccines have many limitations. One of the major problems is the safety concern. Failures in the inactivation can sometimes lead to reversion of the virulent form. Sometimes, quality control tests can fail and it can lead to contamination of vaccine with undetected virus or bacteria. Need for storage in refrigerated conditions is another limitation. Most of the vaccines are administered by parenteral route and it demands need for trained personnel, multiple doses or addition of an adjuvant, specialized storage and transport conditions. Injectable vaccines are able to stimulate systemic humoural responses only while T cell effector activity and mucosal immunity are essential for the prevention of infectious diseases. Parenteral vaccine administrations sometimes produce some secondary effects such as local inflammation at the inoculation point, fever and rarely some hypersensitivity issues. It is also not possible to develop vaccines against all diseases by conventional methods [7] [8] [9] . Due to many pitfalls, the thought of alternative vaccine delivery methods arises out and this paves to the development of plant-based vaccines called 'edible vaccines' [10, 11] .",

In simple, plant or animal-made pharmaceuticals are edible vaccines. In 1989, the effort to produce a plant-based vaccine was formulated by Hiatt and co-workers [11] . In 1990, Dr. Arntzen introduced the concept of using transgenic plants to produce and deliver subunit vaccines. This idea of Arntzen proved that the edible vaccine can annihilate the restrictions in the production of traditional vaccines. In tobacco plant, (Streptococcus mutants) a surface antigen is expressed from hepatitis B by Mason et al. is the milestone in edible vaccine production. [12] In parallel to the production of edible vaccine in tobacco, they also started the production of hepatitis B and heat-labile toxin B in potato and potato plants [11] . These vaccines have an indefensible advantage of over traditional conventional vaccines. Particularly in the developing world, edible vaccine offer exciting possibilities of reducing the burden of diseases such as hepatitis b and diarrhoea where storing and administering vaccine are often major problems. For production of edible vaccines or antibodies, it is desirable to select suitable plants, algae, yeast, insect cells and lactic acid bacteria whose products are consumed raw to avoid degradation [12, 13] .",

M cells are a small amount of follicular-associated enterocytes (FAE) which are mainly found in the gastrointestinal tract. These cells capture a wide range of macromolecules from lumens in the small intestines to antigen submucosal cells (APCs) on Peyer's patches effectively [23] . Of many APCs, dendritic (DC) cells appear to be the most powerful antigenic cells to trigger an adaptive immune reaction in the priming naive T cells [24] . In an immediate phase, DC is found in a stable state, marked by strong endocytic activity and low capacity for primary naive T cells. DCs, however, mature, increase co-stimulatory molecules and migrate to T-cell areas in lymph nodes under inflammatory situations. There are antigens as well as the release of cytokines to help differentiate the naive antigenspecific T cells into effector cells and migrate to a specific inflammatory site [25] . Intestinal DCs can promote na\u00efve t-cell activation and follicular T-helper differentiation (Tfh) either through direct promotion of Tfh differentiation or through promotion of later transformed T-17 cells into Tfh [26, 27] . Such active B cells leave follicles and move to lymphoid MALT where plasma cells secrete antibodies against immunoglobulin A (IgA) [16] . Those same IgA antibodies are diverted to the lumen in secretions across epithelial cells to interact with antibodies [27] . DCs can also capture luminous antigens specifically through the epithelial cell layer and then through dendrites projection into the lumen [28]. The goblet cell, a type of cell involved in the development of mucins, was a recent mechanism for capturing antigen in the small intestine. Intravital microscopy shows that goblet cells can directly capture and supply intestinal antigens [29] . A reliable, edible vaccine will induce specific responses to T and B cells that will also facilitate long-lasting memory cells for subsequent gatherings during actual infection. Although the advancement of \"oral tolerance\" refers to the T-cell-mediated paradox involving a decrease in the specific immune response to previously encountered antigen via the oral route, it was one of the controversies on oral vaccine administration [30, 31] .Antigens are released in the intestinal immune system due to the lack of inflammation in which immature dendritic cells introduce T cells, which induces tolerance [32] . Secreted cytokines, such as IL-10, and cell-to-cell close contact occurs when regulatory T cells impede the growth and development of dendritic cells to modify their tolerogenic mechanism [33]. Recurrent administration of mucous antigen may also lead to suppression of the immune reaction in humour, and vaccines with reliable levels are difficult to produce [34]. ",

Furthermore, vaccine epitopes can be synthesized and accumulated by changing viral capsid proteins [51, 52] . Plant virus-induced infection has many benefits, including a large degree of recombinant protein expression shortly after disease, easy generation of multiple antigenic duplicates on layer of the viral particle and the permission of big-scale infections in the plant [45] . However, viral reproduction products must first be purified from the infected plants before they are vaccinated. This technique of manufacturing also causes plant death following infection.

This is also known as \"molecular farming,\" where marketing-value biomolecules of genetically engineered crops were generated. Numerous on-going clinical trials are underway using purified antigens temporarily generated in injectable vaccine formulations from tobacco plants (Nicotiana benthamiana). For e.g., a Phase II clinical trial has lately been performed using a quadrivalent flu vaccine (VLP) derived from plants and declared in recent times that a phase III clinical study has been undertaken [58] . The idea that plants are edible led to their use for oral vaccinations in the beginning of the 90s. They could be a delivery vehicle, as well as bio factories, being edible. Research studies have attempted in recent times in the growth of edible products to resolve the weaknesses of traditional vaccines [59] . When the idea was launched, several potential benefits have been apparent in using plants to produce vaccines. First, as the biopharmaceutical industry showed, plant vaccines would probably be lower production costs and it could be easy to scale. The victory of the experimental Ebola drug ZMapp manufactured in Nicotiana plants led to the gain of visibility in molecular farming [60, 61] . Unlike the production of biomolecule, however, the edible vaccine formulations require no pre-administration treatment or purification, which further lowers the cost involved with production.The most studies have utilized cultivated potatoes but, as cooking or boiling can weaken most of antigenic proteins, potatoes might not be the best choice in edible vaccines [62] . More than a generalized application, but a successful design and development of genetic transformation methods, plants including tomatoes, maize, tobacco, bananas, carrots and peanuts will have a more bright future as edible vaccines. Till date, a large number of edible species, such as lettuce, tomato, potato, papaya, carrot, quinoa and tobacco has been converted into vaccine antigens. In animal models the appropriate folding and improved expression of the antigens obtained in these processes have been screened [59, 63] .",

These bacteria were considered potential candidates for the mucosal vaccine vector since the ability of LAB to generate specific immune responses to recombinant foreign antigens. This delivery system can provide protection against deterioration of the antigen and trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses [98, 99] . Many LABs, in short Lactobacillus spp and Bacillus subtilis, were used in preclinical studies against various communicable diseases. This research has produced several results, but they have all shown an elicited immune response. Oral B. subtilis spores expressing Helicobacter pylori urease B that protect against Helicobacter infection is one of the example of these type of edible vaccine [100] . LAB has its natural adjuvant and immunomodulatory effects as an important characteristic, but its molecular mechanism is not fully understood. Additionally, other studies reported a dendritic cell maturation effect and cytokine secretion induction [101] . Notwithstanding the hopeful nature of recombinant LABs as vectors for mucosal vaccines and the promising results obtained from murine tests, some characteristics have to be considered, namely that the vaccine strains, although mentioned as GRAS, could not be labelled as avirulent due to the potential transition of antibiotic selection markers into microbes [102] . The advancement of LAB based vaccines requires considereation of various aspects like the role or location of each antigen expressed and route of administration (as different routes will have different immune effects). In general, more studies and clinical trials are required to develop effective LAB-based vaccines (Table 1 ) [103] .",

Oral administration of recombinant MSP 4, MSP 4/5 and MSP1, as an adjunctive therapy with cholera toxin B (CTB) in mice, induced antibody responses against the blood-stage parasite. Large quantity of antigen should be incorporated to the plants to express a minimum amount of antigen [16, 40] . By conventional wisdom, the immune mechanism responsible for protection against malaria will require a multiple of 10-15 antigen targets for proper protection against various stages of malarial infection. Due to antigenic competition, large number of target would not be appropriate to be used for vaccination as single dose [114] . If immunisation schedules could be arranged the stability of vaccines carrying different malarial antigens, their transport and the logistic of vaccination would be an almost impossible task to achieve under the current fiscal constraints so a unique way to circumvent these difficulties, an anti-malarial edible vaccine in transgenic tomato plants were developed",

It should be well approved by the population so that it is necessary to make aware the society on the use and benefits of edible vaccines. In some areas, it is believed that genetically modified plant and products were a threat like evil spirits and destroy the world so there is a crucial role to awake the people from this myth of evil spirit by the authorities. The next important benchmark to check is the stability of the genetically modified plants and proper isolation of the plant is essential [134, 135] . Sometimes the transgene causes allergies. Plant-made oral vaccines might induce allergic reactions during post-translational modifications, and oral tolerance when co-administered with oral adjuvants to mostly activate the mucosal immune system may provoke hypersensitive responses to other proteins contained in the daily food. Recurrent delivery of plant-made edible oral vaccines can boosts regulatory T-cell stimulation contrary to vaccine antigen causes hypersensitivity reactions in case of pollen allergy or food allergy. Prevention of environmental contamination and prevention of serious side effects is mandatory. When compared to other traditional vaccines, edible vaccines promises a better prevention option from diseases if they are developed in a proper manner. This is a costeffective, efficient and safe model as a vaccine [136] [137] [138] . Growing plants for edible vaccine production requires close monitoring. The safety and quality of the genetically modified plants will be a difficult task even though manufacturing of genetically modified plants are regulated. Cross-contamination between genetically modified plants and non-genetically modified plants may occur during pollination and the genetically modified plants themselves become aggressive. Sometimes the DNA or the antigen may release into the water sources by the contact of insects or birds with the plants which causes the contamination of water bodies. The pharmaceutical could accidently enter in to the human food chain and also affect the wildlife population [139] [140] [141] .",

Vaccines are capable of reducing the antibiotic use tremendously and can play a crucial role in an era where antibiotic resistance is becoming a major challenge. Conventional vaccines are very expensive, requires refrigeration, mostly administered by parenteral route and it produces only modest mucosal response. Constant research activities can improve the presently available vaccination techniques and better prevention of infectious diseases can be ensured. Discovery of edible vaccine is one of the major break-through in the branch of biotechnology and its success requires wide acceptance and attention. Compared to the traditional vaccines, edible vaccines do not require sophisticated equipment and machines for the vaccine production. Edible vaccines are safer and do not demand sterile injection conditions and storage facilities etc. Edible vaccines stimulate both systemic and mucosal responses.",
