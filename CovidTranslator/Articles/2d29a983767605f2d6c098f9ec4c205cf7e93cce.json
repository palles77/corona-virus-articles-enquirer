Although women have typically been assigned to activities that were not considered direct combat roles during times of war, albeit females have done dangerous jobs including being pilots during World War II to the present, in the current war in the Persian Gulf, the distinction between combat and noncombat roles have become almost meaningless given adversaries do not wear uniforms, and confrontation has become urban warfare using guerilla tactics against any US troop, convoy, or post regardless of military designation. As such, women, thought to be in \"safer\" roles such as convoy drivers, find themselves in the \"front lines\" facing IED and other weapons just like their male counterparts. In addition to combat-related injuries and the stressors of war, women face discrimination and many are at risk for sexual abuse, victimization, and assault, often from servicemen. 7, 13, 68, 69 Of note, male servicemen have reported sexual abuse. Nevertheless, women in the Persian Gulf face a complex array of biopsychosocial stressors not necessarily faced by their male counterparts. These new threats can pose significant challenges to female military, warranting the attention of civilian and military medical professionals.",

These patients face enormous threats and are at risk for a complex array of biomedical and psychosocial morbidities, some of which may go undiagnosed and impair the patient's return to normal social function.

            "text": "War, Adolescents, and the Middle East (Figs 1 and 2) \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\"-Winston Churchill These words were uttered by Prime Minister Churchill at Parliament in tribute to the pilots of the Royal Air Force (RAF); an iconic speech in its historical significance and, perhaps cautionary or prescient in wisdom. Many of those RAF pilots were adolescents, frighteningly outnumbered by the Luftwaffe, but were nonetheless, able to protect Great Britain and defeat the Nazis. The fate of the world often rests on the shoulders of our youth. The cause of freedom often depends upon our younger generations. Indeed, throughout history, awesome responsibilities have been placed on adolescents. Many of the servicemen and servicewomen participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) are between the ages of 17 and 21; adolescents by medical definition. 82, 83 Such incredible responsibilities undertaken far from home, while experiencing new and vastly different cultures, and being subjected to dangers and violence on a scale beyond comprehension, are the reality of these warrior-adolescents. No one could debate the horrors these young people see on a daily basis, nor the impact-physical, psychological, and social-that they face on their tours of duty and will continue to cope with upon their safe return, God willing, to the United States, Great Britain, or other coalition nation. They age from adolescent to adult in the first battle. Yet they are still adolescents. When they return, we must adapt the health care we deliver to address this hybrid of battle-tested adolescent-adult, addressing the full realm of needs and helping this individual to be able to return to some developmentally appropriate normalcy. [82] [83] [84] The major spheres of influence of an adolescent must be addressed and restored-family, friends, career, close relationships, personal development, health behaviors. [82] [83] [84] However, adolescents are not the only ones who fight wars. Adultssingle, married, parents, male, and female. Most of us imagine the return home to be joyous and fulfilling, will it be if someone has been wounded? 6, 9, 12, 14, 18, 31, [71] [72] [73] 78 Or if someone has lost their job? Or has lost the loved one who was supposed to be waiting at home? Or meeting children who in return are facing a stranger because they were babies when dad (or mom) deployed? 71 What readjustments will those returning face that we can assist as their health care provider? 9, 85 While PTSD is expected, so should substance abuse. Tobacco use among troops is highly prevalent. Often they smoke non-U.S. cigarettes; what health risks beyond the norm would be expected from smoking local tobacco products? Do our communities have the resources for returning troops? The Veterans Administration (VA) cannot and will not take care of all the returning troops. What can we do as physicians to fill the voids?",

In our daily practices delivering high-quality health care can be a challenge in the midst of a seemingly dizzying array of insurance plans, financial and time constraints, and a host of other competing issues that impact upon access, cost, and quality. The most dedicated clinicians often aide their patients in fighting for coverage, care approvals, or access to medications even when \"the system\" seems stacked against the patient. Now imagine an adolescent who has returned from battle, having seen the horrors of war, only to find his or her job has not been preserved, or medical care-physical or psychological-is beyond reach because of either cost, access, or quality? It is challenging enough for adults with good jobs and years of life experience to often obtain appropriate care; think about the returning soldier, sailor, or marine returning from a war zone! We often consider medical care of the military to be the responsibility of military facilities like the VA hospitals, base infirmaries, and the Department of Defense (DoD) Manage Care Support Contract (TRICARE). Yet over one-third or our military in the Persian Gulf are reservists, not full-time active duty military. These are our neighbors, coworkers, 86 and fellow citizens who thus obtain their health care from the nonmilitary medical worldprobably us! As such, they are likely to return to our practices when they come home from war. How many of us in health care have been in the military or in a war zone? Yet we will be called upon to help our patients come to grips with such experiences. Moreover, how familiar are we with the many challenges these people will face-interacting in a \"peaceful\" society, returning to work \"business as usual,\" receiving appropriate psychosocial and medical care attuned to the risks and threats of living in the Middle East or other far off lands?",

There are over 160,000 U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf-most are in Iraq but there are thousands in Afghanistan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, and other countries in the Middle East. Most of the troops are men. However there are a significant number of women serving in uniform as well. While women are generally not assigned direct combat missions, the nature of the urban or guerilla warfare in Iraq, especially, brings the battle to posts and roles not designated as combat operations. Nevertheless, the carnage is real; so are the injuries-mental and physical. Women serving in the Gulf as elsewhere must deal disproportionately with sexual abuse and gender discrimination within the U.S. military and often make accommodations to local cultural customs discriminatory against women that these servicewomen would not face in the U.S.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 42, 60, [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] How many of us have seen a case of dengue or leishmaniasis except in a textbook or lecture? 44, 57, 65, 98, 101, 103 Or treated a case of Q fever? 5, 42 Would we be able to differentiate the neurobehavioral effects of brucellosis from the symptoms of PTSD in a returning Gulf warrior? 43, 13, 22, 27, [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] How long should we be vigilant for signs and symptoms of malaria from a returning soldier who presents with fever? 46, 56 Most of the troops have folks at home who love, depend upon, and worry about them. What is the impact of the Gulf War on families? 71, 109 Are we the health care provider to someone who has a son or daughter, husband or wife, brother or sister, close friend in uniform and in a war zone? What special needs do/will they have that we should anticipate and provide? These may include acts of kindness, not just biomedical care. A random call \"how are you doing? Have you heard from (the person in uniform)? Need to talk? Got a support network (friends, family, clergy)?\" As physicians, we are in a trusted position to ask and a leadership position to try and help. These are times that call upon us to go beyond the mere medical care. Yes, we all perform in an era of multiple competing demands. Many of our colleagues may even be against the U.S. participation in the Gulf. However, we should learn from the lessons of Vietnam and separate our feelings about the war from those for the warrior-our patient.",

TRICARE or CHAMPUS is a military health care program for active duty and retired members of the uniformed services, their families, and survivors and certain former spouses worldwide. 110 As a component of the Military Health System, TRICARE brings together the health care resources of the uniformed services and supplements them with networks of civilian health care professionals, institutions, pharmacies, and suppliers to provide access to health care services while maintaining the capability to support military operations. To be eligible for TRICARE benefits, it is necessary to be registered in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting (DEER) System. TRICARE offers several health plan options. Currently there are about 9.1 million enrolled beneficiaries. Military treatment facilities (MTF) available for TRICARE beneficiaries include 65 military hospitals, 412 medical clinics, and 414 dental clinics. Some civilian medical facilities and health care providers also accept TRICARE but not universally. In the event a VA or MTF is not available to certain returning troops or their families, it is important to work in the community to assist with access to care, especially given the expected biomedical and psychosocial morbidities associated with the current Gulf War.",

The government did not divulge the destruction of a nerve agent chemical plant at Khamisiyah until a few years after the war. Nevertheless, the DoD and VA expended enormous resources and undertook numerous studies including collaboration with the Institute of Medicine-a highly regarded scientific organization and other prestigious, independent research organizations such as the National Academies of Science, the UK Royal Society and Medical Research Council. 91, 93, 95 Resulting research suggested that GWS was not an easily defined, known disease entity, nor was it, as initially thought, a classic psychiatric disorder.

A study at Duke University conducted animal experiments on the combination of countermeasures and insect repellants-DEET and permethrin used by the various militaries. 87 They found that the insect repellants and the nerve agent preventive agent pyridostigmine bromide (BP) were harmless when used alone but could be highly toxic when combined. The researchers suggest that their findings explain the symptoms reported by an estimated 30,000 Gulf War I veterans. 93 These symptoms include respiratory complaints, digestive and skin disorders, fatigue, and memory loss. Some exhibit limb pain or numbness and recurring rashes. The researchers suggest the combination can cause neurological defects.

What the answers are to the Gulf War health problem remain elusive. To be sure, the etiology(s) of GWS is not a one-size-fits-all answer and the links between cohorts or the ability to assign etiologies to groups has been difficult even after years of research. Troops were exposed to chemicals, infections, and combinations thereof, which have not been experienced on such a scale in the past and thus the science must in effect catch up with the symptoms. With the dizzying array of chemicals and potential combinations of environmental contaminants, toxicants compounded by the horrors of war, continued research is necessary. Nevertheless, a key lesson learned from PGW I that can be applied to the current Persian Gulf experiences is to give the returning troops the benefit of the doubt, obtain a thorough medical, exposure, travel, and occupational history. Infections, military medical countermeasures, environment or battlefield chemicals, and the experience of war can create a dynamic interplay of multiple morbidities confounding diagnosis. Often there is tremendous therapeutic \"relief\" that results from validating the patients' concerns. The DoD and VA have developed a variety of resources included web-based risk communication and clinician implementation support (http://www.pdhealth.mil) and complementary tool kits (http://www.pdhealth.mil/clinicians/PDHEM/ Toolkit/view/2/guideline_ver1.2.doc) and practice guidelines (http:// www.oqp.med.va.gov/cpg/cpg.htm).

Of note, historically it has been the noncombat injury and illnesses that have had a significant impact on military missions. 1, 3 In this section we will discuss the combat-related injury, especially TBI and those resulting in amputation, followed by infections that may manifest in illness either in the Gulf or when the serviceman or woman returns home. 1, 3, [15] [16] [17] [18] 20, 21, 60, 62, 63, 108 Large numbers of U.S. troops are returning from southwest Asia, an area where numerous endemic infectious illnesses, desert illnesses, and insect-borne diseases are pervasive. Our returning troops may present with infections that are not common to the U.S. but may have initial symptoms that could be misattributed to common, relatively harmless domestic illnesses. Studies suggest clinicians do a poor job of inquiring about recent travel and diagnosing travel-related illness. In fact, less than 20% of patients with a confirmed travel-related illness were asked about travel; this resulted in delayed or missed diagnosis. [117] [118] [119] This is a cautionary tale to remind us to inquire about deployment, military experiences-even the monthly and yearly obligatory domestic deployments of Reservists, and travel out of the war zone, realizing each country presents an often unique set of risks.",

Operation Iraqi Freedom is the first large-scale combat operation since PGW I that involves the U.S. Marines. 24 One of their combat surgical companies has provided updated information for consideration; most wounds were the result of high-explosive weapons/munitions such as mines and grenades, with 51% of the wounds to the extremities. 24 Of note, military blast exposure, mostly in the form of roadside IED, continues to be the primary mechanism of injury. 25, 33, [37] [38] [39] [40] In 2005, the U.S. Military reported 10,953 IED attacks; an average of 30/day. New combat body armor can protect troops from penetrating ballistic injury such as bullets but does not provide significant protection against IED, especially blast overpressure, which will be discussed in the following section. [37] [38] [39] Explosives and Blast Injury (Fig 3) . Bombings and the use of explosives represent the majority of terrorism-related mass casualty incidentsdomestic and foreign, as well as a significant proportion of injuries in OIF and OEF. Explosives inflict damage by creating a rapid release of energy in the form of gases and heat, depending upon the type of explosive used. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] From a terrorism perspective, there are four categories of explosives ranging from (1) projectiles such as missiles; (2) those set to explode when triggered by a target such as land mines; (3) passive weapons detonated remotely; and (4) weapons (usually of category 3) designed and placed to produce the greatest degree of physical and psychological damage. The latter two are used most often in modern insurgencies. There is also a phenomenon referred to as \"overpressure\" with high explosives. 34, 38, 39 The flames, \"rush of air,\" and pressure changes all cause injuries. The chain of events beginning with the initial blast determines the general and neurological injuries that the victim sustains.",

Conventional explosives generate a biphasic blast wave (Friedlander Wave Form) that spreads from the primary point source. 33, 39 The first phase is a high-pressure shock wave of very brief duration. It is followed by the second phase-the blast wind, which is air in motion, and how the phrase \"winds of war\" emerged during the Civil War, when observers found some of the dead on the battlefield did not have visible wounds. 33 Injuries from the initial blast are the direct result of blast overpressure on tissue; the outcome differs comparatively concerning hollow or solid organs. [15] [16] [17] [18] 35, 40, 41 Among the organs most susceptible from blast overpressure are the ears, the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract, and the brain. These organs are most affected as a result of the interface between a solid or liquid and air. As the pressure wave passes through the tissue, the molecules of the solid or liquid are thrown into the gas media. 33, 38, 39 Bowel perforation can be acute or delayed as a result of blast injury. The colon is more susceptible than the small bowel, owing to the relative air in the former. Of note, the patient who may have lung or brain injury from primary blast injury may not appear to have been injured! Stories from WW II of troops found dead with apparently no injuries, when autopsied, were found to have extensive pulmonary and/or brain primary blast injury.",

Amputees often are concerned about if and how relationships with friends and family will change. Their anger may manifest in different ways and be targeted to family, friends, even health care professionals. Patients must be allowed to find healthy ways to communicate but HCP should be able to tolerate the expression, especially early in the aftermath as a normal response to a horrific, life-changing event. Later, amputees may start expressing fears about sexual functioning. 9, 14, [20] [21] [22] Allowing the patient to address these issues openly, and, facilitating such dialogue among partners, is enormously helpful. Amputee patients can more effectively be treated if addressing the needs of the patient's family. Loved ones may want to spend time with their injured family member. Of concern, they may not, and reasons should be addressed. 9, 14 These include fear of what to say, guilt, squeamishness looking at the wound, and other issues. Children, though often more resilient than given credit for, should nevertheless be assisted in understanding and integrating the experience in a less traumatic fashion before encountering the amputee. 9, 14, [20] [21] [22] A variety of resources are being developed to care for the traumatized patient. The VA and other military medical facilities are improving their mental health services and emphasizing the need to collocate them with orthopedic and other medical services. Different rules may apply to disability benefits concerning active duty compared to Reserve or National Guard. 110 Whether military or civilian, it is important to address patient concerns and their future goals. Moreover, it is important to assist them in achieving realistic goals.

So far, several thousand have been treated for it, while thousands are believed to be undiagnosed. 17, 18 Primary blast injuries to the brain and spinal cord include blast wave induced concussion as well as barotrauma caused by acute gas embolism, which can produce ischemia and infarction. Loss of consciousness and contrecoup/coup injuries are possible. Of course, the severity of wounds will differ depending upon proximity to explosion, body armor, and other factors.",

            "text": "There are many causes of head trauma. These include blast exposure, gunshot wounds, and motor vehicle injury. According to military data, troops in Iraq experience one explosion a month, on average. Each blast raises the risk that the next one will do harm. A blast creates a sudden increase in air pressure followed by a rapid decrease in pressure. [15] [16] [17] [18] 33, [38] [39] [40] [41] These pressure shifts can injure the brain directly, producing contusion or concussion. Air emboli can also occur, resulting in infarcts. Neurological injuries resulting from explosions are the result of a complex cascade of physical and biological events. 33 A pressure wave from the blast courses through the brain, initiating the damage. While severely injured troops are supposed to be screened for head trauma, others who were not obviously injured but were nevertheless rendered unconscious may not present for care nor be considered victims of head injury. However, the group of troops who are rendered unconscious are at risk for TBI and may develop difficulty concentrating, manifest increased irritability or other signs and symptoms but remain undiagnosed. Because behavior-related injury such as PTSD has been considered a disorder associated with malingering, the symptoms of unrecognized TBI can as well, further confounding the situation. Much of what we know about head injuries are from prior wars, sports concussion patients, and civilian TBI literature. Lessons learned from OIF and OEF will undoubtedly provide additional information.",

Not surprising, there is a geographic component to infectious threats. Multi-drug-resistant A. baumanii infections are described as epidemic among wounded in Iraq, compared to Afghanistan. Of concern, nosocomial transmission of A baumannii within Walter Reed Army Medical Center resulted in 53 infections and four deaths. 49 As a result, wounded patients are often isolated upon return to the U.S. until they are cleared of A. baumannii. Infection control is good medical practice. It is important to address nosocomial infections, especially given the commonplace nature of this problem in U.S. hospitals. While the organism may be different in civilian health care facilities compared to combat hospitals, nevertheless, unnecessary deaths and protracted illness occur because of inattention to infection control measures as basic as handwashing and separating dirty from clean activities.",

Entamoeba histolytica and other protozoans were found. In 2005 another outbreak of diarrhea involving U.S. troops revealed \u03fe50% were infected with Cryptosporidium species. Soldiers who present post deployment with chronic diarrhea should be thoroughly evaluated including consideration of post infection irritable bowel syndrome and for parasites such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Entamoeba.",

Leishmaniasis is a sandfly-borne parasitic disease caused by protozoa that live inside mammalian macrophages. This is problematic given U.S. troops suffer intense vector exposures and report receiving numerous insect bites. The high season for insects runs from April to December. As part of a prevention strategy and control research over 50,000 sandflies were collected from sites throughout Iraq; between 0.06 and 2.78% of flies were infected with leishmaniasis. Of concern, use of insect repellent seems to be problematic among troops. In one study of troops infected with Old World Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (OWCL), 80% said they used insect repellants but 26% said that appropriate vector control was unavailable at some point during their deployment. 2, 61 In another study, 14.6% reported using DEET more than occasionally and 51.2% never used it. Only 21.6% believed the product was safe. Clinicians caring for Reserve and National Guard members should counsel their patients that DEET, especially 30-50%, is a safe and effective measure to reduce the risk of insect-borne illness. OWCL is usually associated with the species Leishmania major and Leishmania tropica.",

Culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) permit speciation; species identification may have an impact upon management strategies. 130 Treatment for L. major, which is usually self-limited but can persist up to 12 months, includes watchful waiting, cryotherapy, heat therapy, topical paromomycin, azoles such as ketoconazole or fluconazole, and the pentavalent antimonials, which can be administered intralesional and parenterally. 67, 131, 132 However, systemic therapies such as the azoles are reserved for larger or multiple lesions as well as cosmetically problematic lesions. The clinician should be especially sensitive to the cosmetic and emotional needs of the returning troop and not assume the lesion is not bothersome visually. Perception is reality and the serviceman or woman may assign more value to the lesion as part of an overall post combat emotional response. Therefore it is important to take the entire context of their deployment experience-medical and psychological health-into account when providing care. In contrast to L. majo, other species are often treated more aggressively with systemic therapies. However, treatment may not eradicate leishmania infection as this is a persistent intracellular organism. Nevertheless, systemic treatment can control clinical disease. Leishmania can reactivate in patients who become immunocompromised. Patients should be counseled against blood donation; military policy dictates lifelong deferral of blood donation for persons who are diagnosed with leishmaniasis whether treated or not. 2, 44, 45, 103, 133 Given some returning troops may be financially challenged and consider blood donation for funds, it is worth emphasizing that the donor can infect an innocent individual.

Given some troops will be treated by civilian health care professionals, malaria should be considered in patients with fever, chills, sweats, headaches, myalgias, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms can occur 7 to 9 days after being bitten but this is variable. Moreover, malaria may cause anemia and jaundice.

Troops should be counseled against self-medication and the use of locally acquired medications, based upon concerns about safety and effectiveness, especially Halofantrine (Halfin), which can cause serious heartrelated side effects including death.",

The true incidence of infection is unclear and likely underestimated. C. burnetti is highly infectious-a single organism can cause illness. 134 Of concern, cases appearing at U.S. health care facilities resulting from infection in the Persian Gulf were initially misdiagnosed despite the unusual and severe nature of the presenting symptoms in otherwise healthy, strong war-fighters. Again, the caveat is that returning troops may be infected with illnesses endemic to the Middle East; vigilance is key and patients who have recently returned but have seemingly commonplace symptoms may warrant more aggressive investigation given recent exposures abroad. C. burnetti infection is often subclinical or mild and self-limited. Clinically it sometimes resembles a \"flu-like illness.\" Common clinical presentations include a nonspecific febrile illness, which can remit and recur, and is consistent with atypical pneumonia and hepatitis. High fever, headache, myalgias, malaise, anorexia, and diarrhea are possible. 5, 42, 108 Chronic infection can occur and involves the heart, arteries, liver, and bone. Laboratory findings include elevated liver enzymes and decreased platelet count. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate may occur. Abdominal ultrasound may reveal diffuse echogenic portal triads sometimes referred to as \"starry sky\" appearance of acute hepatitis. Chest radiographic findings can include infiltrates but a variety of findings are possible if pulmonary involvement occurs (Fig 7) . 64 The most characteristic lesion of liver involvement is the fibrin-ring or \"doughnut\" granuloma-a fat vacuole surrounded by a ring of fibrin, epithelioid cells, giant cells, and neutrophils.",

Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease endemic in the Middle East and caused by several species of Brucella organisms that are highly infectious via the aerosol route. 43, 134 The British referred to it as \"undulant fever\" in the mid 1700s, and more recently it has been dubbed \"flaky fever\" because of the altered mental status that sometimes occurs as a result of the direct neurotoxicity. Transmission is usually through contact with infected animals or ingesting inadequately prepared food or dairy products from sick animals. Brucella can be ingested, inhaled, or percutaneously inoculated. It is estimated that inhalation of only 10 to 100 bacteria is sufficient to cause disease in humans. 106, 134 The incubation can be as short as 3 days but is variable and can be much longer with some cases developing into an insidious, chronic illness. From 2003 to 2005 there were three reports of brucellosis among U.S. troops. However, in the U.S., like overseas, brucellosis is often misdiagnosed and the number of cases underreported. Worldwide estimates vary; some suggest 88/ 100,000 persons. Civilian clinicians should emphasize the importance of eating properly prepared foods including dairy products to their patients who are about to be deployed and/or counsel family members in the U.S. to warn loved ones in the Middle East. Sometimes this can be difficult given our troops are often encouraged to interact with local villagers; cultural norms and polite response to offers of food and hospitality are often challenging. Nevertheless, the need to adhere to safe practices is of paramount importance.",

Subsequently it was one of the first biologicals weaponized by the U.S. military. 134 Symptoms include irregular fever, headache, profound weakness and fatigue, chills, sweating, arthralgias, myalgias, depression, and changes in mental status.

Therapy with rifampin, a tetracycline, and an aminoglycoside is indicated for infections with complications such as endocarditis or meningoencephalitis. 43, 134 It is worth remembering that certain biological illnesses and bioweapons, including brucellosis, may contain neurotoxins that directly or indirectly affect neurological function and alter behavior, even mimicking some of the early behavioral changes of PTSD. Biological illnesses and bioweapons may present with or have deleterious affects on mental status, neurological function, or level of cognitive function, negatively impacting the ability to obtain an accurate history as well as mimicking delirium, dementia, or other age-related cognitive deficits or behaviors including \"sundown psychosis.\" 106, 134, 135 Viral hemorrhagic fevers, the equine encephalitic agents, and even anthrax are associated with mental status changes. 106, 134 While rates of PTSD among OIF and OEF troops are much higher than in prior conflicts, the astute clinician will also be vigilant for other etiologies and possibly comorbidities. 22, 72, 73, 76, 78, 80 Respiratory Illness. In 2004 a self-reported survey was collected from \u03fe15,000 homeward-bound members of the U.S. military. Sixty-nine percent reported one episode of respiratory illness, while 14% experienced more than three episodes. 3, 47, 53 Of interest, almost 40% reported they smoked more than a half a pack of cigarettes per day, with 48% being first-time smokers or former smokers who restarted upon deployment. Additionally, from March 2003 through March 2004, several cases of severe pneumonia were reported with clinical symptoms including rapid onset of cough, shortness of breath with or without fever, and accompanied by leukocytosis. Chest radiographs revealed bilateral alveolar infiltrates often requiring mechanical ventilation. Of concern, some of these patients had acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), 47 which is a rare idiopathic disease usually characterized by pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, eosinophilic infiltration of the lung, and respiratory failure. During this timeframe, 18 cases of AEP were identified among the total military deployed in or near Iraq, 2 of which died. New-onset smoking was the only reported associated result from an epidemiologic study. There have been some association with smoking non-U.S. tobacco products. There have been additional cases of AEP since this study period, one of which presented with symptoms 1 month after returning to the U.S. Early diagnosis is essential because prompt medical treatment with corticosteroids can result in favorable outcomes; late diagnosis can be fatal. This again underscores the concern that an illness can be initiated during deployment but manifest upon return to the U.S. The astute clinician must be mindful of travel-related and deploymentrelated illness.",

Of concern, multi-drug-resistant (including ciprofloxacin-resistant) Salmonella enterica Typhi has been identified in Iraq. 58 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles continues to be reported in the region. Polio has been reported in Yemen in 2005 and, in 2005-2006, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has been found in poultry in the Middle East. 137 Pilgrims to the Hajj in Saudi Arabia have acquired meningococcal infections by serotypes A and W-135. Other parasitic infections include schistosomiasis and echinococcus, which to date have not been problematic among U.S. troops. 1, 3, 58, 137 Cases of ophthalmomyiasis have occurred in Iraq. 59 This presents with abrupt onset of conjunctivitis and is caused by motile, mucoid, flatsegmented larvae with a size \u03fd1 mm and caused by Oestrus ovis, the sheep nasal botfly, which can deposit larvae in the eye; it can also involve the globe, resulting in sight-threatening complications.",

This is not just a global threat, but a domestic one, with drug, multidrug and extremely drug resistant tuberculosis continuing to be a significant public health concern. WHO estimates suggest cases per 100,000 persons in Afghanistan are twice the number of cases per 100,000 persons in Iraq. 58 The U.S. military uses purified protein derivative of tuberculin to screen troops before and after deployment. The deployment-associated conversion rate is \u03f32.5%; the number of active cases of TB among U.S. troops serving in the Persian Gulf has been negligible. Nevertheless, it is important to follow-up with troops deployed in endemic regions upon return to the U.S. to ensure that they have been appropriately screened or treated.",

War-zone exposures may have considerable negative emotional and behavioral consequences. 22, 32, 74, 75, 109, 116, [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] Men and women evacuated from the war zone with physical injuries are at higher risk for developing PTSD and other trauma-related issues. 22, 27, 31 Given the mind-body connection often gets severed in current health care and collocation of mental and biomedical services is not often the case, clinical attention should not be solely aimed at the physical wounds of war. 14,22,122-126 Some military members will develop chronic, debilitating mental illnesses as a result of traumatic exposures, either directly from patterns of injury known as TBI or psychiatric, as with PTSD, or from depression. [7] [8] [9] 13, 75, 86 During and after the Persian Gulf War in Iraq and Afghanistan, primary care providers may notice an increased number of veterans or even active duty personnel as well as family members, some of whom may have a loved one who was severely injured or killed. 6, 14, 20, 21, 32, 71, 73, 75, 82 While the physical wounds of war are often hard to miss-prosthetics, casts, or bandages, psychological trauma and mental illness, even brain injury, may initially present with subtle clues that, if not early diagnosed, can evolve into significant morbidities. 15, 17, 18 Among the psychiatric morbidities, PTSD and depression are expected to have high prevalence rates among returning troops. While depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders may occur, this monograph will provide more in-depth information on the neuropsychiatric illnesses like PTSD and TBI, especially given clinicians are likely to be more familiar with the early recognition of depression and anxiety disorders. It bears repeating that multiple psychiatric disorders are possible. Patients want their primary care clinicians to acknowledge their traumatic experiences and responses. Therefore HCP should be sensitive to the complex needs of service men and women returning from the Gulf as well as their families and loved ones. Of concern, most medical casualties will not seek mental health care and many veterans can be expected to be reluctant to acknowledge emotional distress as concerns arise about being diagnosed with a mental illness. Therefore, clinicians should avoid pathologizing common stress reactions and be sensitive to these concerns, while being vigilant about psychopathology and ensuring proper mental as well as physical care is provided.",

It is worth noting that the mental health and primary care clinicians' task is further complicated by what may emerge as a \"signature wound\" in the Gulf War and war on terror-TBI, which is discussed elsewhere in this monograph. 15, 17, 18 The value of faith-based care cannot be underestimated. Chaplain services are valuable partners that are considered trustworthy by troops, are often collocated in combat zones and thus considered participants in the stress environment, and are generally a regular presence throughout the military, including health care facilities. The old adage \"there are no atheists in foxholes\" may or may not hold true. Nevertheless, faith-based professionals can be enormously helpful for family members; church members may provide a psychosocial and spiritual support network. Inquiring about and arranging faith-based support should be part of the total care plan. Studies support the importance of religion and spirituality as resilience and protective factors 82 as well as being therapeutic in the recovery phase.",

Sexual assault is well recognized as a risk for PTSD.

It is worth mentioning that reporting sexual assault can have a chilling effect on the servicewoman's military career; often women do not report this to their superiors, again setting the stage for a variety of psychopathologies.

Almost one in four Americans will suffer from a mental illness per year, yet only a fraction will receive appropriate care or be effectively treated. Stigma, shame, access to experienced mental health care in the community, concerns about abandonment, and cost are some of the issues facing persons with mental illness. As health care professionals, we can do much to help destigmatize their psychiatric disease and assist with proper referral and follow-up. Increasingly, civilian HCP may be called upon to provide care to returning veterans. The President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors reported a lack of mental health professionals to serve military personnel and their families. As of March 2007 only 27 of the 1400 VA hospitals and clinics contained inpatient PTSD centers. Of additional concern, there are only two VA facilities that treat women exclusively. 29, 30, 110 Clearly the demand for mental health care for returning troops can be expected to increase dramatically in the coming months and years. The Veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom who are eligible for 2 years of free military service related health care through the VA. However, it is important to recognize the value of civilian health care, especially given the VA may not be able to handle the increased demand. According to the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, it appears that the VA repeatedly understated wait times for injured veterans seeking medical care and in many serious cases forced them to wait more than 30 days, counter to department policy. Of concern, only three in four veterans received timely appointments albeit VA reports to Congress stated 95% of veterans received such care. In 2005 the immune globulin (IG) expressed concerns that over 50,000 veterans were on waiting lists. 29, 30, 110 Regardless of etiology, returning troops deserve prompt care. The VA may not have the surge capacity to provide the access and quality required and thus military, VA, and civilian medical communities will need to collaborate more closely over the coming months.",

            "text": "With the new roles the military faces, the frequency of deployment into a threat zone or overseas has increased in the past 10 years since the first Persian Gulf War. Such deployments not only pose a threat to the troops but can be a challenge to the military families left behind. Medical or emotional/behavioral problems as well as financial problems may preexist and with the resulting loss-temporary or permanent-of a parent or spouse can destabilize an already precarious situation, creating significant problems for the family. 71 Because the U.S. military is all volunteer, the heavy responsibilities are carried by two distinct sources of troops-the active military and Reserve or National Guard, who can and have been activated as well as deployed to combat areas. A significant proportion of those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are from Reserve or National Guard Units. Do we inquire of our patients if they are active, reserve, or former military or in families of a deployed troop? Such information is critical especially to assist us in anticipating challenges our patients and their families may undergo. While the active duty military family lives with deployment as part of their life, and often lives within military communities where a readymade support network of friends with similar issues and government services are nearby, Reserve or National Guard service members and their families reside in nonmilitary communities and work in civilian jobs generally remote from military resources or support groups. Families of Reservists can feel isolated and less supported. There are many commu-nities that have few or none being deployed in active duty and thus are neither familiar with nor equipped to provide the support necessary to a civilian family that has instantly become a military family. Beyond the normal worries for a loved one in a war zone are the financial concerns, especially if deployment results in loss of income in the transition from a high paying civilian job to a lower paying military one. Children can be impacted, especially if the community is demonstrably \"antiwar\"-adults can often separate the \"antiwar\" from the \"antiwarrior\" sentiments; children may not, thus causing a variety of emotional challenges that a savvy clinician should be attuned to and inquire about. [71] [72] [73] [74] According to the Iraq War Clinician Guide 2nd Edition, there are emotional cycles associated with deployment that have been divided into five stages, each associated with specific emotional issues that should be anticipated and addressed. 71 These include the following: (1) Predeployment; (2) Deployment; (3) Sustainment; (4) Re-deployment; and (5) Post-deployment.",

            "text": "Not unexpectedly, children respond to deployment in very individualistic ways depending upon their age and psychosocial and cognitive developmental periods. Infants (\u054512 months of age) tend to respond to changes in their environment, schedule, or presence and availability of their caregivers. Worrisome signs include apathy, refusal to eat, even weight loss. Toddlers (1-3 years of age) usually take their cues from their primary caregiver. As such, if the non-deployed parent is coping well and present, the toddler should be expected to cope well. Signs of concern include new onset sullenness, temper tantrums, tearfulness, and sleep disturbances. Clearly, socializing the child-play dates, support from other parents-is critical both for the toddler and for the remaining parent. Preschool children (3 to 6 years of age) are more keenly aware of a parent's absence. Worrisome signs include regressive behaviors in a variety of domains including toileting, thumb-sucking, separation anxiety/clinginess, and sleep disturbances. Irritability, aggression, depression, or somatic complaints may occur. While these can also occur in nonmilitary children, nevertheless, the are worth follow-up. The parent and clinician should be vigilant for children who think their parent left because of something they did. These inaccuracies of thought should be addressed rapidly and in a matter-of-fact manner, discussing the deployment briefly but honestly. This is critical, especially if the military parent gets killed; children should not bear the guilt of their parent's death and thus feelings of responsibility about the deployment should be immedi-ately dispelled. Increased attention by the remaining parent, conversations with images of the deployed parent about how much he or she loves the child, and maintaining family routines including physical and emotional warmth are critical. School-aged children (6 to 12 years of age) may manifest their emotional issues by \"acting out\" or exhibiting irritability, aggression, or complains and whining-which may be uncharacteristic of the child prior to the deployment. Given children are increasingly being exposed to information through their friends, the internet, and other media, it is important to have regular discussions with the child, to allay their worries as opportunities for information sharing. Ideally parents should limit the amount of media exposure children receive during times of war; in the information age, this may be easier said than accomplished. Therefore, regular conversations with children are important to address their concerns factually and with love. The age of initiation of alcohol and tobacco occurs from 10 to 13 years of age. [82] [83] [84] [85] Experimentation to chronic use can worsen in the child of a deployed parent. Teenagers (13 to 19 years of age) may behave similarly to children in terms of irritability, rebelliousness, or other challenging behaviors. 71, 82 Good communications should be encouraged as their concerns about the deployed parent (and the possible impact losing a parent can have on them and the family) may manifest in destructive ways. Helping the non-deployed parent to set clear and realistic expectations about behavior, school, and home life can provide supportive structure. The non-deployed parent should be counseled to observe for high-risk behaviors, sexual acting out, or changes in behavior that may result from substance abuse.",

Young children can better visualize the time gap between deployment and return using a chart or timeline, perhaps with stars on the different days representing how helpful the child has been in the parent's absence, which can serve as a gift to the returning parent. 71 Other ideas and resources can be found in the references.

As physicians, we could argue as a take off on this concept that a society should also be judged by how it treats its veterans and those charged with protecting our freedoms. If this is the benchmark upon which a society should be judged great or glaringly wanting of moral clarity and direction, what does it say about the U.S. when nearly 25% of the homeless are veterans and that the rate of convergence for recently returning veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, ie, from having a home to becoming homeless, is faster than at any other time in American history?! 70 What does it say when the VA Office of the Inspector General report states that returning veterans are receiving less than optimal care, and must wait an exceedingly long time for such care?! 30, 31, 110 Homelessness. According to the VA, approximately 196,000 veterans of all ages were homeless on any given night during 2006. 70, 110 As if almost 200,000 veterans was not troubling enough, the fact that between 40,000 and 64,000 veterans are chronically homelessness-those who live either on the streets or in shelters for more than a year-is even more troubling. While veterans make up 11% of the population, they comprise 26% of the homeless on any given day. 70 So far, more than 400 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan war have turned up homeless in Washington, DC. The VA and other aid groups say there will be a surge in homeless veterans-returning troops-in the coming years. 70 According to experts who work with war vets, and based upon the Vietnam veteran experience, it often takes several years after separating from the military before veterans' problems evolve to a point that drives them into the streets. Of concern, some veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are already turning up at homeless shelters, and the amount expected could be enormous.",

Of those who had positive responses consistent with a mental disorder, only 23 to 40% sought mental health care. Respondents indicated there were barriers to receiving mental health-waiting times, but most often the perception of stigma among those most in need of mental health care. Given these troops are likely representative of their colleagues who continue to be involved in PGW II, preparing our practices to address the mental health needs of returning troops is critical. The stigma of mental health is not isolated to military personnel; it remains a persistent challenge. Moreover, patients can feel abandoned when referred from our practice to a mental health professional. Clearly communicating that they are not being \"turfed\" but instead are being offered specialist care, similar to being offered cardiology referral if a heart defect was found and reassuring the patient that the mental health professional is one more member of a team that will still center around the patient and primary care provider, can enhance the likelihood of obtaining care. Increasingly evidence suggests collocating mental health services as part of the medical practice has improved outcomes. In some rural areas advanced planning will be required to increase opportunities for referral and access to mental health services. Clinicians in such areas may want to reach out to the nearest VA center and establish a collaborative relationship with PTSD and other services in anticipation of patients returning from the Persian Gulf.",

Large-scale studies following male and female Gulf War I veterans over several periods of time after return from the Middle East demonstrated a significantly higher risk of death from accidents, especially motor vehicle accidents (MVA) during the initial years home. [90] [91] [92] 96, 97 Of note, many were not wearing seatbelts. However, by the sixth year post war, the relative risk of mortality due to MVA had fallen significantly. These results are consistent with a mortality study of Vietnam War veterans. 96 They, too, experienced excess mortality from MVA, which was most pronounced in the first 5 years after serving in Vietnam. After the fifth year, the mortality rate from MVA for Vietnam veterans paralleled non-Vietnam controls. Given MVA are a leading cause of death among adolescents and clearly a worrisome cause of death among newly returning war veterans, it is important for clinicians to alert troop patients about this risk and the cofactors that are likely to be at play-alcohol and other substance abuse, 77 exhaustion, work, stress, or coping related, medication effect. It is well described that adolescent males who drive with passengers are more likely to be involved in an MVA; returning troops who are adolescents or young adult males are not immune to this reality and should be counseled about the trend in mortality associated with returning war veterans and MVA. Opening up such dialogue may also make discussing seatbelt use and substance abuse more likely.",

VA statistics from October through December 2005 report 1618 females and 1360 males seeking medical care stated they were sexually assaulted or harassed. 145 A somewhat unique aspect of MST is that it occurs in a setting where the victim lives and works. Civilians do not often live and work in the same environment, unlike the military, which ultimately has its own legal rules (Uniform Code of Military Justice) and social norms. As such, the victim often must live and work closely with their perpetrators, which can lead to an ongoing feeling of victimization, feelings of helplessness, and exacerbating the trauma. Victims may also rely on their perpetrators, who may be supervisors with enormous influence on careers.",

            "text": "An unprecedented number of women are serving in PGW II compared to prior wars. Overall, more than 100,000 female servicemembers have been deployed to the Middle East, including Iraq and Afghanistan, compared with 7500 who served in Vietnam and 40,000 in PGW I. Although typically limited to combat-support roles, as the battlefield lines are blurred and combat occurs in the streets, roadside bombs, ambushes, guerilla warfare have all virtually eliminated the safety categories and distinction between combat and support roles. Ironically driving a truck in Iraq is considered combat-support, yet with IED and roadside bombs, this activity is turning out to be one of the most dangerous jobs in PGW II. Camp Victory was attacked by mortars, resulting in several deaths including two servicewomen. As such, women are in harm's way with their male counterparts. The impact of combat on women, especially in terms of psychiatric illness such as PTSD, remains to be fully characterized. Most data on PTSD and women are derived from civilian research and usually related to sexual trauma, including rape. 143, 144 A 2003 DoD report revealed nearly one-third of a nationwide sample of female veterans who sought health care through a VA said they experienced rape or attempted rape during their military service. Of that group, 37% reported that they were raped multiple times and 14% reported being gang-raped. A small VA study following PGW I suggested that rates of sexual harassment and assault rise during wartime. From 2001 to 2005 nearly 44,000 women veterans reported being victims of sexual assault or harassment, sometimes from fellow servicemembers. 77, 110, 138 Compared to the civilian population, men and women in the military have been shown to have higher rates of sexual and physical abuse in their backgrounds than the general population and women entering the military are likely to have more traumas accumulated than their male counterparts. Although a small percentage of male veterans revealed being sexually abused/assaulted, the overwhelming majority are women. As such, women experience what has been referred to as a \"double whammy\" in PGW II: military sexual trauma and combat exposure. What impact this will have ultimately on the psychiatric health of returning women from the Gulf remains to be seen. While sexual trauma presents diagnostic and treatment challenges among civilian patients, the additional impact of military life and the pervasive sense among many military women that reporting a sexual crime is seldom worthwhile can enhance feelings of vulnerability, loss of control, and fear and exacerbate the effect of other traumas. Since many of the perpetrators of the sexual abuse are supervisors, reporting such traumas can place the victim in a challenging position-career-wise, among colleagues, and just the normal pain attendant with reliving the event during the vetting process of a formal complaint. Also, unlike the typical male bonding that occurs among wartime combatants, small studies suggest this is not the case among female troops during deployment. Such isolation can contribute to the deleterious impact of a wartime experience and is worth remembering when treating female military patients-current or retired, as the signs and symptoms of untreated mental illness resulting from such events can persist and go unaddressed or be considered associated with other issues. Interestingly, such isolation does not appear to occur among Reserve and medical units or when commanders establish a zero tolerance for such sexism.",

Studies suggest clinicians do a poor job of obtaining a travel history, including a general lack of awareness by physicians concerning the potential for nonendemic disease in the population that they attend. 118, 119 In one such study evaluating whether a travel history was recorded in patients, a travel history was recorded in only 2% of all patients presenting to this emergency department, although among total number of patients presenting to the emergency department, 5.3% actually had the potential for a travel-related illness. 118, 119 While many of the illnesses that troops are likely to import are not contagious, we should take small comfort in that it only takes one missed case of a contagion to cause an outbreak! Physicians and HCP should consider the physical, rehabilitative, and mental health issues within the broader context of a patient who has been in a war zone and now must reenter and adjust to society, job, and family. Addressing these domains as part of the overall therapeutic and clinical management plan is critical. Moreover, these domains, including financial pressures, will impact recovery, not unlike our civilian patients. However, unlike noncombatant civilians, our civilian troop patients may have faced dramatic, draconian, and devastating experiences unfathomable to their neighbors and thus requiring appropriate medical service. Being sensitive to the self-image and pride of these patients, prearranging or collocating psychosocial services, and allowing for seamless care has been shown to improve outcomes. Integrating psychiatry and primary care, often referred to as co-location, is effective for improving access to mental health services and for increasing treatment engagement.",
