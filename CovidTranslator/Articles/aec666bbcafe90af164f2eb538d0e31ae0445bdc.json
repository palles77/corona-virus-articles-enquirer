They act as immune sentinels to detect and coordinate responses to invading pathogens and antigens entering the liver via the portal vein1 -3. Under basal conditions these cells are replenished by recruitment of precursors from blood and this increases with inflammation. The exact nature of the precursor cells is unclear but they are likely to reside within the circulating CD16 + monocyte population4 -7. mDC arise from bone marrow-derived progenitors within the monocyte pool8 -10 and several populations of precursors have been proposed including lineage negative CD11c + monocytes, CD34 + progenitors11 and in humans CD16 + monocytes12. Human monocytes display heterogeneity defined by expression of chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules, CD14 and CD1613 -15. The CD14 + CD16 ++ subset expresses high levels of the chemokine receptor CX 3 CR1 and is believed to give rise to DCs with potent antigen-presenting capabilities16 and inflammatory tissue macrophages15 , 17. Furthermore, transendothelial migration of CD16 + monocytes in vitro induces differentiation into functional DCs suggesting that recruitment itself may shape their subsequent differentiation18.",

In the mouse, precursor mDC enter inflamed skin using ICAM-2, P-Selectin and E-Selectin and the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2 and CCR523 but little is known about hepatic recruitment via the sinusoidal vascular bed. Because recruitment of neutrophils and lymphocytes to the liver involves distinct adhesion pathways24 , 25 we hypothesised that unique combinations of molecules might regulate monocyte recruitment. We report that recruitment of human CD16+ monocytes to the inflamed liver involves unique combinations of adhesion molecules in which interactions mediated by VAP-1 and the chemokine CX 3 CL1 are critically important.",

Fresh liver was minced and incubated with collagenase IV (Sigma, Poole, UK) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C before filtering through 40\u00b5m nylon mesh, diluted in PBS and layered on 25% Nycodenz/ PBS and centrifuged at 700g for 20min. Cells at the interface were collected, washed and cholangiocytes removed by negative immunomagnetic selection with anti-HEA-125. Endothelial cells were positively selected using anti-CD31 antibody and cultured in human endothelial basal media plus penicillin/streptomycin/L-glutamine/10% human serum, HGF and VEGF (10 ng/mL, Peprotech, UK) and used within four passages. This protocol was developed to isolate sufficient cells from either normal or diseased human liver for use in functional assays. In rats it has been suggested that CD31 should not be used to isolate sinusoidal cells because cell-surface CD31 is absent from quiescent sinusoidal endothelium and its use generates cells with low frequencies of fenestrae28. However we find that human sinusoidal endothelial cells express cell surface CD31, albeit at lower levels than vascular endothelium, a finding consistent with other published reports29. To confirm that CD31selected cells from human liver have a sinusoidal phenotype we demonstrated expression of several receptors that are present on sinusoidal but not vascular endothelium including the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-130, the C-type lectins L-SIGN31, L-SECtin, mannose receptor and CLEVER-125 , 32 , 33. These cells thus have a unique sinusoidal phenotype. They also express ICAM-1 and VAP-1 and increase expression of VCAM-1 in response to cytokines, a phenotype that corresponds to activated sinusoidal endothelium in vivo. Consistent with their distinct phenotype we have previously reported functional and signalling responses in these cells that differ from those seen with vascular endothelial cells27 , 34. The relevance of in vitro studies using HSEC to the situation in vivo is illustrated by the fact that many of our in vitro findings with HSEC have subsequently been confirmed by others using in vivo models. For example the involvement of VAP-1 in lymphocyte recruitment via hepatic sinusoids was first proposed using HSEC in vitro27 and subsequently confirmed by others using rat and mouse models in vivo35 , 36. Thus HSEC cultured for up to 4 passages maintain expression of cell surface receptors that a) define them as sinusoidal in origin and b) allow them to interact with leukocytes during flow-based assays. We thus believe that these cells, despite losing fenestrations during passage in culture, are appropriate to model leukocyte recruitment to the liver particularly as this process usually occurs through damaged or inflamed sinusoids and we refer to them as human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSEC).",

The number of CD16 + monocytes binding HSEC was determined (Fig 4a) and adhesion subclassified into cells which became activated, changed shape and migrated across the endothelial monolayer (phase dark , Fig 4b) . Several inhibitors had no effect on adhesion or migration on HSEC, including antibodies against P-and E-selectin (data not shown) confirming the lack of involvement of selectins in this vascular bed39. Heterotrimeric G\u03b1i proteins are involved in chemokine receptor signalling and can be inhibited using PTX. Pre-incubation of CD16 + monocytes with PTX caused a decrease in total adherent cells and virtually abolished transmigration as demonstrated by the lack of phase-dark, monocytes beneath the endothelium in figure 4b. Because CD16 + cells express high levels of CX 3 CR1 we looked to inhibit this receptor using antibodies and by desensitisation by prior exposure to ligand CX 3 CL1. Both approaches reduced transmigration (normalised to number of adherent cells) to a similar level seen with PTX treatment (Fig 4b) suggesting that CX 3 CR1 is the dominant GPC receptor involved. Total adhesion was more efficiently inhibited by anti-CX 3 CR1 antibody than by PTX suggesting that some adhesion is GPC-independent consistent with previous studies showing that transmembrane CX 3 CL1 can support leucocyte adhesion directly (Fig 4a) . Antibodies against VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in combination or VAP-1 decreased total adherent cells (Fig 4a) whereas anti-ICAM-1 or anti-VCAM-1 alone had no effect (data not shown). Inhibition of HSEC with anti-VAP-1 antibodies immediately before and during the flow-based adhesion assay reduced the proportion of cells undergoing transendothelial migration (Fig 4b) .",

            "text": "The liver contains mDCs and tissue macrophages that regulate local immune responses. Under basal conditions these cells are continually replenished by the recruitment of precursors from blood and this increases with inflammation. We show that CD16 + cells redistribute in the chronically inflamed liver and can be detected at sites of inflammation and fibrosis (Fig 3) . This is consistent with studies suggesting that CD16 + cells are the precursors of inflammatory tissue macrophages and inflammatory DCs13. Human CD16 + cells undergo differentiation into DCs after migration through endothelium10 , 16 , 18 and CD16 + DCs are present in the human liver41 leading us to investigate the molecules involved in CD16+ monocyte recruitment from blood into the liver via hepatic sinusoids. We used flow-based adhesion assays incorporating primary human hepatic sinusoidal endothelium to model the liver sinusoid27. We showed that human CD16 + monocytes express a cell adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors that could promote recruitment from blood, including CCR4, CXCR4, CX 3 CR1, CD18 and CD49d. We then demonstrated that they use a combination of CX 3 CL1, VCAM-1 and VAP-1 to arrest on HSEC from flow and a combination of CX 3 CR1 and VAP-1 to undergo transendothelial migration. Thus we show for the first time that VAP-1 is involved in DC precursor recruitment to peripheral tissue and define the role played by CX 3 CR1 in transmigration through human endothelium under flow. CX 3 CR1, which is expressed at uniformly high levels on CD16 + monocytes (Fig 1) , was the dominant chemokine receptor involved (Fig 4-5) and antibodies against CX 3 CR1 inhibited both adhesion and transmigration across HSEC. CX 3 CL1 is a transmembrane chemokine that can support adhesion independently of signalling through its GPC receptor consistent with our finding that adhesion of CD16 + cells on HSEC is more efficiently inhibited by anti-CX 3 CL1 antibodies than PTX. However transmigration was clearly dependent on signalling via CX 3 CR1 because it was almost completely prevented by PTX. To investigate the role of CX 3 CL1 further we studied adhesion under flow to recombinant proteins. In this system CX 3 CL1 was unable to support adhesion on its own but facilitated adhesion when coimmobilised with VCAM-1 by activating the \u03b14\u03b21 integrin. The recombinant CX 3 CL1 used in these experiments is not fully glycosylated and because GPC-independent adhesion is mediated by the mucin domains that decorate transmembrane CX 3 CL1 this may explain its inability to directly support adhesion. CX 3 CL1 has previously been shown to support monocyte adhesion to HUVEC under flow17 and our observations extend its role to a liver-specific vascular bed and implicate it in transendothelial migration in addition to adhesion. CX 3 CL1 is expressed in human liver and in the present study we confirm expression on bile ducts and show induced expression in chronic inflammatory liver disease on sinusoids where it could act to promote recruitment of CX 3 CR1+ cells from blood (Fig 2) 42 , 43. CD16 + monocytes in blood showed homogenous intermediate levels of CX 3 CR1 whereas mDC isolated from the liver included CX 3 CR1 high cells and a population that expressed levels comparable to blood CD16+ monocytes. CD16 + monocytes lost CX 3 CR1 surface expression during the process of transmigration and as a consequence of receptor engagement by CX 3 CL1. Exposure to soluble CX 3 CL1 in vitro resulted in a profound but transient loss of cell-surface CX 3 CR1 and could explain why prior exposure to soluble CX 3 CL1 prevents transendothelial migration; a similar effect has been reported for other chemokine receptors44. Thus CX 3 CL1 must be appropriately retained and presented on endothelium to function efficiently. The re-expression of CX 3 CR1 after cells have been recruited to the liver parenchyma could be important for their onward migration to areas of portal or lobular inflammation where CX 3 CL1 is also strongly expressed (figure 242).",

VAP-1 belongs to an expanding family of ectoenzymes involved in cellular trafficking45. VAP-1 is present on liver sinusoidal endothelium where it has been implicated in lymphocyte recruitment in humans and rodents27 , 35 , 36. Soluble VAP-1 is detected at high levels in the serum of patients with chronic liver disease but not other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis46 , 47. VAP-1 can mediate sialic acid dependent tethering and transendothelial migration of lymphocytes on sinusoidal endothelium27 , 48. This is the first time that VAP-1 has been implicated in monocyte transendothelial migration although reduced monocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites has been reported in mice after VAP-1 blockade49. We found that VAP-1 was involved in both adhesion and transendothelial migration. The combination of immobilised CX 3 CL1 and VAP-1 proteins on their own failed to support significant levels of adhesion suggesting that VAP-1 operates in conjunction with other receptors to mediate transendothelial migration consistent with data showing that enzymatic activity of VAP-1 modulates the expression of other adhesion molecules34 (Fig 5) . These findings add to an evolving body of literature that implicates VAP-1 as an important molecule in leucocyte transmigration across hepatic sinusoidal endothelium in vitro and in vivo and provide further evidence that the sinusoidal bed uses distinct combinations of molecules to recruit leucocytes to the liver parenchyma25 , 34 -36 , 50 . The role of VAP-1 in transendothelial migration is particularly interesting. Monocyte transendothelial migration across other endothelium involves CD31, CD99, CD226 and the JAMs which are present at tight junctions22 , 51 -53 the lack of which in hepatic sinusoids could explain why VAP-1 has a dominant role in this vascular bed.",

The demonstration that VAP-1 and CX 3 CL1 are implicated in the recruitment of CD16+ monocytes across inflamed hepatic endothelium and that CD16 + cells localize at areas of inflammation and fibrosis has important implications for the pathogenesis of hepatic inflammation and the design of therapies to modulate monocyte recruitment in liver disease. The recent appreciation that VAP-1 can be inhibited by small molecule enzyme inhibitors opens up exciting therapeutic approaches to target this receptor. It is thus critical to understand which leucocytes rely on VAP-1 for entry into tissue and the outcome of inhibiting this receptor in vivo27 , 56 , 57. CD16 + and CD16 \u2212 monocytes were analyzed for the expression of cell adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors. Some surface molecules, such as CX 3 CR1, CD49d and CD18 were expressed at the same level on both populations (a, b, e). When compared to CD16 \u2212 monocytes, molecules such as CD62L and CCR7 were expressed at a lower level or not at all on CD16 + monocytes (c, f). CD11c was noted on both populations, but at a slightly higher level on CD16 + monocytes (d), consistent with their putative role as mDC precursors. The complete characterization of chemokine receptor expression on three populations of monocytes (h) defined by expression of CD14 and CD16 as CD14 + CD16 + , CD14 \u2212 CD16 + Normal and diseased human liver tissue was analysed for the expression of CX 3 CL1. (A) Total RNA was analysed for the expression of CX 3 CL1 mRNA by qPCR demonstrating a 2fold increase in primary biliary cirrhosis and a 3-3.5-fold increase in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) compared with non-inflamed liver. A similar increase was detected in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), though this did not reach significance. All values were relative to normal liver (NL) (n = 6 \u00b1 SEM, p \u2264 0.01 *, p \u2264 0.001 **). Immunohistochemical analysis of normal liver (B) revealed expression of CX 3 CL1 was limited to biliary structures (arrowed), whilst in diseased liver expression persisted on bile ducts and increased on sinusoids (C). The localization of CD16 + cells was assessed in normal and diseased human liver tissue by immunohistochemistry. In normal liver (A), CD16 + cells were located throughout the parenchyma and portal tracts (PT) but in diseased liver (B) were associated with the inflammatory infiltrate and fibrotic septa and largely absent from regenerative nodules (RN). CD16 + monocytes adhere to and transmigrate across HSEC under flow. Pre-treatment of CD16 + monocytes with PTX or HSEC with blocking antibodies to VAP-1, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 or CX 3 CL1 resulted in a significant decrease in the total number of cells adhering to the endothelial monolayer from flow (a). We quantified the number of adherent cells that subsequently went on to transmigrate through the HSEC monolayer. Transmigrated cells that have migrated beneath the endothelial monolayer were phase dark and easily distinguished from the phase bright cells adherent on surface of the monolayer. The numbers of adherent cells transmigrating was significantly reduced in the presence of a blocking anti-VAP-1 antibody and virtually abolished by the treatment of HSEC with anti-CX 3 CL1 or of CX 3 CL1 treatment induces adhesion and shape change in CD16 + monocytes on VCAM-1. CD16 + monocytes bound to immobilised VCAM-1 in microslides. Less than 50% of the cells undergo shape change. The combination of immobilised VCAM-1 and CX 3 CL1 supported a higher number of adherent cells the majority of which showed morphological changes consistent with a migratory phenotype. Furthermore, analysis of the activation of the \u03b14\u03b21 integrin on CD16 + monocytes demonstrated a near doubling of median channel fluorescence following exposure to CX 3 CL1 (b). Flow data represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of three experiments, cytometry data representative of three repeats. p \u2264 0.001 ** A comparison of CX 3 CR1 expression on CD16 + monocytes prior to and after transmigration across HSEC in vitro. Purified CD16 + monocytes were applied to the top chamber of a transwell coated with HSEC that had been stimulated with TNF\u03b1. Transmigrated cells were collected and compared to pre-emigrant cells for CX 3 CR1 expression. The transmigrated cells exhibited a near-complete loss of CX 3 CR1 expression (a). Additionally, this loss of expression could be recapitulated by incubating CD16 + monocytes with CX 3 CL1 prior to antibody labelling (b). Pre-incubation for 1hr completely diminished receptor expression which recovered following an additional 1hr rest following removal of exogenous CX 3 CL1. We confirmed this was not due to receptor masking by repeating the experiment on ice. This receptor loss following engagement of CX 3 CR1 may contribute to retaining precursor DC in the liver promoting their maturation into liver-specific mDC. Representative flow cytometric profiles from three replicate experiments. A comparison of the expression of CX 3 CR1 on CD16 + monocytes and mDC from human liver. Peripheral blood CD16 + monocytes taken from a patient about to undergo liver transplantation for end stage liver disease exhibited an intermediate level of expression of CX 3 CR1, similar to the level of expression noted in healthy donors (Fig 1a) . The mDC, representing mature forms of DC precursors that transmigrated across HSEC, were isolated from the liver of the same patient a few hours later and identified by flow cytometry as cells within the monocyte cloud that expressed CD86 and high levels of MHC Class II. The mDC exhibited either high or low expression of CX 3 CR1 and when compared to the intermediate level of expression on CD16 + monocytes, suggesting that the microenvironment of the liver may regulate the expression of CX 3 CR1.
