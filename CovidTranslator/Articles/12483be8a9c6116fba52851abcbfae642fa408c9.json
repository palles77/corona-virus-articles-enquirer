Accurate, rapid and simple detection of CDV is critical to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks. In this study, a visible and incubation instrument-free reversetranscription recombinase polymerase amplification assay combined with lateral flow strip (LFS RT-RPA) was developed to detect CDV using primers and lateral flow (LF) probe specific for the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. The CDV LFS RT-RPA assay was performed in a closed fist using body heat for 15 min, and the products were visible to the naked eyes on the LFS within 5 min. The assay could detect CDV, and there was no cross-reaction with the other viruses tested. Using the in vitro transcribed CDV RNA as template, the analytical sensitivity was 9.4 \u00d7 10 1 copies per reaction, which was the same result as that of a real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was further evaluated by testing 32 nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples, and CDV RNA positive rate was 62.0% (20/32) by LFS RT-RPA, which was the same result as that of the real-time RT-PCR assay. The performance of the LFS RT-RPA was comparable to real-time RT-PCR, while the LFS RT-RPA assay was much faster and easier to perform. The novel CDV LFS RT-RPA assay provides an attractive and promising tool for rapid and reliable detection of CDV in the underequipped laboratory and point-of-need facility, which is of great significance in CD control in low resource settings.",

CDV is a non-segmented, negative-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and the genus Morbillivirus, and is one of the most lethal infectious agents in both susceptible free-living and captive carnivores (Lednicky et al., 2004) . CDV-infected dogs may develop respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, ophthalmic or neurological disorders that appear simultaneously or sequentially (Beineke et al., 2009; Decaro et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2011) . The broad spectrum of clinical signs, not dissimilar from the signs observed in other respiratory and enteric diseases of dogs, hampers accurate and early clinical diagnosis of canine distemper (Seki et al., 2003) . Therefore, rapid and accurate diagnosis of CDV infection would enable veterinarians to implement appropriate strategies in time to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks, particularly within a shelter environment (Elia et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal DNA amplification technique that has been demonstrated to be rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective (Daher et al., 2016; Piepenburg et al., 2006) . The RPA reaction uses enzymes called recombinases that form complexes with oligonucleotide primers and pair the primers with homologous sequences in DNA. A single-stranded DNA binding protein binds to the displaced DNA strand and stabilizes the resulting loop. The primer then initiates DNA amplification by a strand-displacing DNA polymerase (Piepenburg et al., 2006) . Real-time detection of the RPA amplification mainly depends on the Exonuclease III and exo probe, while the direct visual detection of the RPA products depends on the Endonuclease IV, LF probe and the opposing amplification primer labeled at 5' end with a biotin. The LF probe oligonucleotide backbone includes a 5\u2032-antigenic label (typically a FAM group), an internal abasic nucleotide analogue (a tetrahydrofuran residue or THF) and a 3\u2032-polymerase extension blocking group (such as a C3-spacer). The amplicons are then detected by naked eyes in the 'sandwich' assay formats, such as a lateral flow strip (LFS) that contains anti-FAM gold conjugates and biotin-ligand molecules. Our laboratory had developed a real-time RT-RPA assay based on exo probe for real-time detection of CDV while the assay still depended on the specialized instrument, Genie III (OptiGene, West Sussex, UK) (Wang et al., 2017a) . Series of LFS RPA assays had been developed for the detection of porcine parvovirus (PPV), peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) (Hou et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017 Yang et al., , 2016 .",

The CDV LFS RT-RPA reaction tubes were held in a closed fist for 15 min, and the results were inspected directly with the naked eyes within 5 min. Other CDV genotypes were not included in the assay except for the genotype America-2, which is deficiency of the study. RPA is tolerant to 5-9 mismatches in primer and probe showing no influence on the performance of the assay (Abd El Wahed et al., 2013; Daher et al., 2015) and there were only 2-4 mismatches in the primers and probe in this study with other CDV genotypes available in Gen-Bank, such as strain 2784/2013 (genotype Arctic, KF914669), strain BJ-01 (genotype Asia-1, KF856711), strain 50Cb1/H (genotype Asia-2, AB490678), strain HLJ2/07 (genotype Asia-3, HQ540292), strain 5804 P (genotype European, AY386316), and strain Onderstepoort (genotype America-1, AF378705). It is assumed the assay would detect the other six genotypes of CDV basing on the facts that the LFS RT-RPA assay targeted the conserved N gene of CDV, which was further validated by the fact that the CDV strains detected in the study were identified to be Asia-1 genotype. In addition, use of Trizol for extraction in this study causes concerns about hazardous chemical waste removal for low resource settings. When using the CDV LFS RT-RPA assay in low resource settings, the use of the commercial RNA extraction kit is recommended. RPA operates at a wide range of temperatures and does not require the reaction temperature to be precisely controlled (Piepenburg et al., 2006) . TwistDx recommends an incubation temperature of 37\u00b0C (the temperature of the human body), and others studies have shown that RPA retains reliable functionality between 31\u00b0C and 43\u00b0C (Lillis et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016) , even between 30\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C (Wu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2016) . Our study also showed that RPA could work well for detection of PCV2 between 34\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C (Wang et al., 2016) . Normal human body temperature (36.1-37\u00b0C) is within the above temperature range, and several RPA assays have been developed to perform the reaction using body heat by either holding the reaction tubes in the axilla or in closed fists (Crannell et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017b) . In this study, the CDV LFS RT-RPA assay was performed by holding the reaction tubes in a closed fist, which is one feature of the assay. The assays were performed well by three different technicians in the laboratory, office or in the field with an ambient temperature of 24.4\u00b0C, 22.5\u00b0C and 17.0\u00b0C, respectively, and the temperature in the closed fists was 37.0\u00b0C, 37.5\u00b0C and 35.7\u00b0C, respectively.",

In the LFS RT-RPA assays for PPRV and BEFV, the viral RNA was not used as the template directly, while there was an additional process to reverse transcribe the extracted RNA to cDNA prior to performing the assays, which need approximately 30-60 min (Hou et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017) . In this assay, we added MMLV (4U/\u03bcL) and RNase inhibitor (0.8U/\u03bcL) into the TwistAmp\u2122 nfo reaction system, and the CDV LFS RT-RPA worked well with CDV RNA as the template, which is the other advantage of our assay. To our knowledge, the developed CDV LFS RT-RPA assay is the first LFS RT-RPA assay directly using RNA as the template and independent of any instrument during reaction process.",

In the evaluation of the assay performances on the clinical samples, the diagnostic agreement was 100% between the CDV LFS RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR, demonstrating excellent agreements between the two assays. Nevertheless, the LFS RT-RPA showed distinct advantages in terms of detection time and equipment requirements.
