            "text": "Human B cell lymphomas are suitable targets for immunotherapy. Clinical trials with mouse-human chimeric B cell-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have already shown promising results. However, limitations for their use in clinical trials can be the lack of sufficient amounts and high production costs. Expression of mAbs in the mammary gland of transgenic animals provides an economically advantageous possibility for production of sufficient quantities of a promising antibody for clinical trials and beyond. In this paper, we show the feasibility of this approach, by generating transgenic mice expressing mouse-human chimeric anti-CD19 mAbs in their milk. Mouse anti-CD19 variable (V) region genes were combined with human IgG1 heavy (H) and kappa light (L) chain constant (C) region genes and fused to the bovine \u03b2-lactoglobulin (BLG) promoter in two separate expression cassettes. Co-injection resulted in five transgenic lines. In one of these lines completely assembled chimeric mAbs were secreted into the milk, at an approximate level of 0.5 mg/ml. These mAbs were able to bind specifically to the CD19 surface antigen on human B cells.",

            "text": "Tumors of lymphoid origin are suitable targets for treatment with mAbs, because these tumors express a number of well-characterized antigens and are more accessible than solid tumors. In case of human B cell malignancies, therapy with mAbs can be directed against the tumor-specific surface immunoglobulin idiotype or against B cell restricted surface antigens like CD19, CD20 or CD22 (Link & Weiner, * Author for correspondence: Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Building 1, E3-Q, P.O.

Effective treatment with unconjugated mAbs depends largely on their ability to recruit host effector mechanisms, such as complement-mediated lysis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). It has been shown that these effector functions can be improved by replacing the murine C-regions of the antibody with the corresponding human equivalents, resulting in mouse-human chimeric mAbs (Liu et al., 1987; Reff et al., 1994) . In addition, it was found that chimeric mAbs have a prolonged survival in the human circulation and are less immunogenic (LoBuglio et al., 1989) , allowing for repeated dosing strategies.",

            "text": "Recently, a large multicenter study has been completed in which 166 patients with B cell lymphoma have been treated with a mouse-human chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, resulting in an overall response rate of 48% (McLaughlin, 1998) . However, a major limitation in clinical trials with promising mAbs can be the lack of sufficient quantities of these antibodies. Expression systems have been developed to achieve secretion of large amounts of mAbs in cell culture, but these systems appear to have a maximum expression level of 1 mg/ml (Reff, 1993) , and are very expensive due to the high costs of serum, equipment and a specialized labor force. The mammary gland of living animals is able to produce high quantities of complex heterologous proteins and at a low cost, as has been amply demonstrated (Lee & de Boer, 1994; Wall et al., 1997) . For example, expression levels of up to 10 mg/ml in milk of transgenic mice have been reported for complex human proteins such as fibrinogen (Prunkard et al., 1996) , \u03b11-antitrypsin (Archibald et al., 1990; Bischoff et al., 1992) and \u03b1-glucosidase (Bijvoet et al., 1998) , and these proteins were shown to be biologically active. Here we report the expression in milk of transgenic mice of immunoglobulin H-and L-chain transgenes encoding a mouse-human chimeric IgG1/\u03ba anti-CD19 mAb and show that it can bind specifically to its target on human B cells. If high expression levels of functional mAbs can be achieved in the milk of larger animals, then this method offers a possibility for large-scale, cost-effective production of mAbs that have great potential for use in treatment of human B cell malignancies.",

When the ovine BLG promoter was used to drive the expression of the human \u03b1 1 -antitrypsin gene, levels up to 7 mg/ml were produced in the transgenic mouse milk (Archibald et al., 1990) . However, in the same study, the promoter was shown to function in a positiondependent manner. Using the bovine BLG promoter, we also found the transgene expression to be integration site dependent. Therefore, more transgenic lines have to be made to see whether or not higher expression levels can be achieved.",

The surface expression of the CD19 antigen on these JY*hCD19 transfectants is about one log higher than on JY-wild type cells and is comparable to the CD20 antigen or 10 \u00b5l of a diluted (1:10) milk sample from a female non-transgenic littermate (negative control, 12 dL), followed by PE-labeled F(ab) 2 fragments of a mouse anti-human IgG(Fc). Expression of the CD20 and CD19 surface antigens on the cells was determined by direct staining with PE-conjugated primary antibodies (CD20PE and CD19PE). (B) In order to determine relative quantities, JY*hCD19 cells were incubated with 10 \u00b5l of serial dilutions of the same two milk samples of line 2 as in panel A, and bound chimeric immunoglobulin was detected with PE-labeled F(ab) 2 fragments of a mouse anti-human IgG(Fc) (anti-hu PE). The mean fluorescence intensity is plotted against the milk sample dilution factor. surface expression on the same cells (Figure 2A ; Hooijberg et al., 1995) . Incubation of these cells with diluted milk samples of the two mice of line 2, followed by detection of bound immunoglobulin with PE-conjugated F(ab) 2 fragments of goat anti-human IgG(Fc), resulted in a high mean fluorescence intensity ( Figure 2A) illustrating binding of the chimeric antibodies to the CD19 antigen. In order to determine relative quantities of the antibodies, cells were incubated with serial dilutions of the milk samples. The dose-response curve ( Figure 2B ) shows that the chimeric antibody level in the milk of mouse 25069 is higher than the level in the milk of mouse 21428, as could also be seen on the western blot ( Figure 1B) .",
