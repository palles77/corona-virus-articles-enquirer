A virus, turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV), capable of reproducing the disease symptoms, was isolated by several laboratories and was shown to be an enveloped virus with virions 80-600 mn in diameter but also with elongated forms (McDougall and Cook, 1986; Wilding et al., 1986; Wyeth et al., 1986; Giraud et al., 1986) . Protruding from the virus surface were projections 13-15 nm long, and nucleocapsids 15 nm in diameter have been seen in disrupted particles. The virus failed to haemagglutinate turkey, chicken, human 0 and guinea pig erythrocytes. These observations, together with preliminary analysis of the polypeptides of virus grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures , have suggested that TRTV is a member of the Paramyxoviridae, possibly of the Pneumouirw genus.",

When virus was dissociated at 100\u00b0C with SDS but without mercaptoethanol (Fig. 5, track n) no ~53 or the feint band of 22K was detected. Instead there were diffuse bands of M, 59K (~59) and 93K (~93). Denaturation at room temperature without reduction (Fig. 5, track o) resulted in a decrease of ~59 and p93 and an increase in material near the top of the gel. Reduction of ~59, excised from a gel, resulted in the conversion of ~59 to ~53 and ~15 (Fig. 6, compare tracks c and f) . The most likely explanation for these results is that ~59 corresponds to the fusion glycoprotein of members of the Paramyxoviridae family, ~53 and ~15 corresponding to the fusion protein glycopolypeptides Fl and F2, respectively. In the absence of reduction the cleaved fusion protein (F1,2) has an apparent it4, of 59K and comprises Fl and F2 linked by a disulphide bond.

Our results complement and extend those recently published by Collins and Gough (1988) and Ling and Pringle (1988) . Collins and Gough (1988) analysed TRTV grown in chick embryo fibroblasts by Coomassie Blue and Schiff's staining of virion polypeptides separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Table 1) . Schiff s staining showed that polypeptides of M, 84K and 54K were glycosylated although it did not detect glycans on the 15K polypeptide.",

A comparison of the structural polypeptides of the three genera of the Paramyxoviridae is shown in Table 1 . On the basis of molecular weight alone three polypeptides discriminate the pneumoviruses from the other two genera, p24/25 (not possessed by the morbilli-and paramyxouirus genera) N and P (Wunner and Pringle, 1976; Levine, 1977; Cash et al., 1977) . TRTV had a 22K polypeptide detected after lentil-lectin affinity selection of [ 35S]methionine-labelled cell-associated proteins which may be analogous to the p24/25 &-ion-associated polypeptide of RS virus. A 19K polypeptide was detected by Ling and Pringle after both in vivo and in vitro translation of TRTV mRNA. The 22K polypeptide and p43 and p35 which bound to lentil-lectin (Fig. 2 ) may have done so either non-specifically or because they were associated with the glycoproteins ~68 and ~53. As with RS virus (Wunner and Pringle, 1976; Peeples and Levine, 1979) nucleocapsid preparations of TRTV consisted predominantly of ~42, clearly showing that p42 is the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Characteristically the pneumovirus N protein has a significantly lower &I, than that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (Table 1) . So, too, has the phosphorylated (P) protein. Although we have no direct evidence to identify p40 it is likely that this is the P protein of TRTV. P35, by virtue of its M,, its abundance in infected cells and its presence in small quantities in nucleocapsid preparations (Peeples and Levine, 1979) is likely to be the matrix (M) protein.",

            "text": "The largest glycopolypeptide of the Paramyxoviridae is the HN, H and G protein of the Paramyxovirus, Morbillivirus and Pneumovirus genera, respectively. Features of the TRTV ~82 indicate that this is analogous to the G protein of pneumoviruses. As with G of RS virus, p82 was not usually detected in cell extracts or virions labelled with [35S]methionine (Wunner and Pringle, 1976; Cash et al., 1977; Pringle et al., 1981; Dubovi, 1982; Gruber and Levine, 1983 ) although the RS virus G protein could be detected when [3H]leucine or a mixture of radiolabelled amino acids was used (Levine, 1977; Peeples and Levine, 1979; Dubovi, 1982) . Cloning and sequencing of the RS virus G protein has shown that this is due to the presence of only 2 methionine residues (Wertz et al., 1985; Satake et al., 1985) . The ~82 of TRTV was readily detected by radiolabelled glucosamine; indeed it was the major glycopolypeptide detected in this way, an observation also made by Ling and Pringle (1988) and by Collins and Gough using Schiffs reagent and with RS virus (Levine, 1977; Dubovi, 1982; Pringle et al., 1981; Gruber and Levine, 1983) . A further indication that ~82 is structurally more closely related to G of RS virus than to the H or HN of the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses is our observation that tunicamycin reduced only slightly glycosylation of ~82. Whereas the H and HN glycoproteins are believed to be associated solely with N-linked glycans the G protein of RS virus, whose polypeptide moiety is only 32.5K, has largely O-linked glycans and only 4 potential glycosylation sites for N-linked glycans. Consequently tunicamycin resulted in only a small M, decrease leaving a protein which was still substantially glycosylated (Wertz et al., 1985; Satake et al., 1985) . Tunicamycin sensitivity of the glycosylation of the TRTV 35-45K glycosylated material showed that the glycans were of the N-linked type. While the identity of this material is unclear it is possible that it is the polypeptide moiety of ~82 associated with different amounts of only N-linked glycans. Ling and Pringle reported a broad, minor [3H]glucosamine-labelled band, referred to as having a M, of 31K, in immunoprecipitates of TRTV-infected cell lysates. A broad band of similar M, was detected by Collins and Cough (1988) using Schiff's reagent but was not commented upon. Ball et al. (1986) observed that a vaccinia virus recombinant containing the RS virus G protein gene sometimes expressed minor glycopolypeptide species of lower M,. They suggested that this might correspond to the 46K species observed by Gruber and Levine (1985) which was proposed as a precursor to the G protein.",

            "text": "Although sequencing has shown that G of RS virus is structurally very different from the HN and H glycoproteins, we observed that ~82 of TRTV appeared to migrate as a dimer following denaturation without reduction, a feature of the HN protein of Newcastle disease virus (Garten et al., 1980) which has not been observed with RS virus G protein (Gruber and Levine, 1983) . Alternatively, non-reduced ~82 might have migrated more slowly than reduced ~82 because of differences in tertiary structure. Some strains of Newcastle disease paramyxovirus produce virions which contain a precursor to HN, termed HNO, which has a M, of about 8K greater than HN (Garten et al., 1980) . The similarity between p97 and ~82 with respect to the diffuse nature of the bands and the extent of their M, decrease following replication in the presence of tunicamycin suggests that p97 is related to ~82. Whether p97 is a precursor of ~82 or simply a differently glycosylated form remains to be investigated.",

Our observations of ~68, p53 and ~15, the aggregates of ~53 and the association of ~53 with p15 in the absence of reduction lead us to propose that ~68, p54 and ~15 are analogous to FO, Fl and F2, respectively, of other viruses of the Far~~o~~dae family, and that the 59K gly~pol~eptide is the form in which cleaved F migrates in non-reducing gels. The absence of p68 in virions indicates that TRTV from Vero cells has F in the completely cleaved form. The inhibition of glycosylation of ~53 and pl5 by tunicamycin shows that their glycans are of the N-linked type, a feature common to the F proteins of all three genera of the P~~~o~dae.",
