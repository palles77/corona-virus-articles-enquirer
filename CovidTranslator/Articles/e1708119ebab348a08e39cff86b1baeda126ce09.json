[1] [2] [3] [4] These non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) comprise small RNAs such as microRNAs 5 as well as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, only a minute fraction of the large number of non-coding gene products has been identified or characterized at all. The few individual examples studied in greater detail provide evidence that lncRNAs can execute a broad range of important functions in the cell. [6] [7] [8] Individual long ncRNAs have been implicated e.g., in gene regulation, [9] [10] [11] splicing control, [12] [13] [14] or X chromosome dosage compensation. 15, 16 Notably, some of the lncRNAs have also been implicated in human diseases and most importantly in cancer",

[17] [18] [19] [20] One of the first lncRNA genes discovered was MALAT1, the metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, 21 later also referred to as NEAT2 for nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 2. MALAT1 is highly abundant and is expressed in many healthy organs, most strongly in pancreas and lung. 21 Deregulation or a functional role for MALAT1 have now been established in many human cancer entities including lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), uterine endometrial stromal sarcoma, cervical cancer, breast cancer, osteosarcoma and colorectal cancer, but MALAT1 has also been linked to viral infection or alcohol abuse. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MALAT1 is significantly associated with metastasis and serves as an independent prognostic marker for patient survival in early stage lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. 21, 30 It promotes cell motility of lung cancer cells 31 and supports generate functional lncRNA knockouts also in human cell lines using zinc finger nucleases to stably integrate RNA destabilizing elements into the human genome site-specifically at the start of an lncRNA gene. 41 Here, we exploit this technique and achieve the efficient silencing of MALAT1 expression in human lung and liver cancer cells. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that the lncRNA MALAT1 is not essential for cell proliferation, cell cycle progression or maintenance of nuclear architecture. Our human loss-of-function model is complemented by a Malat1 knockout mouse model. Malat1-null mice are viable and without any histological signs of developmental defects. Thus, the loss of the highly abundant, nuclear enriched and evolutionarily conserved lncRNA MALAT1 is unexpectedly compatible with life and development.",

Therefore, we employed an innovative approach that we recently developed to create highly specific and efficient loss-of-function models of abundant ncRNAs in human cancer cell lines. 41 This approach relies on the stable and site-specific integration of RNA destabilizing elements into the cancer cell genome mediated by zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) (Fig. 1C) . The ZFN binds to a specific site in the genome and introduces a DNA doublestrand break. When a repair template is present, this break is repaired via homologous recombination allowing a site-specific integration of exogenous sequences. Here, we integrate a cassette comprising the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a selection marker and a polyadenylation signal (polyA), which functions as the RNA destabilizing element silencing downstream sequences.",

As in A549 cells, MALAT1 was specifically and very efficiently suppressed in stable HLE lines. We obtained single cell MALAT1 knockout clones (KO) in both cancer cell lines with a 1000-fold reduction of MALAT1 expression in A549 KO clones and over 200-fold reduction of MALAT1 in HLE KO clones (Fig. 1D) . This approach depleted the full-length MALAT1 transcript: two different qRT-PCR primer pairs located at either proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells by regulating CASPASE-8, CASPASE-3, BAX, BCL-2 and BCL-XL. 22 Furthermore, MALAT1 is functionally important for trophoblast invasion during embryonic development 32 and is associated with synaptogenesis. 33 In summary, MALAT1 is strongly expressed in many tissues, significantly regulated under various physiological and pathological conditions and has been linked to a plethora of functions at the cellular level including proliferation, apoptosis, migration or invasion.",

Genetic knockout models have only been established for very few lncRNAs. For example, the Malat1-neighboring lncRNA Neat1 (nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1), which is essential for paraspeckle formation, has been knocked out in mice, but no phenotype has been reported so far. 39, 40 To overcome this challenge and to create quantitative loss-of-functions models, we have developed a strategy to with similar fractions of cells in G1-, S-and G2/M-phase, respectively ( Fig. 2B and D) .

A number of studies point to a crucial role of RNA as an architectural factor for shaping the genome and its nuclear environment. 42 Since MALAT1 is a highly abundant RNA strongly enriched in the nucleus, we hypothesized that its loss might affect the structural organization of the nucleus. 35, 38 Accordingly, we examined the effect of the MALAT1 knockout with respect to several nuclear subcompartments for which an architectural role of RNA has been reported previously. RNA-dependent changes in nuclear morphology at a resolution of 200-300 nm can be directly detected after fluorescent labeling via evaluation of optical sections acquired by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) as demonstrated in RNase microinjection experiments. 43 end of the MALAT1 transcript yielded the same negative results for MALAT1 expression in the knockout cell clones (Fig. 1D) .",

One of the most prominent characteristics of cancer cells is their ability to proliferate-even in the absence of external stimuli due to deregulated signaling cascades. We used our knockout system to analyze the role of MALAT1 in lung and liver cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, we performed cell cycle analyses and proliferation assays with a panel of three MALAT1 wild-type (WT) control cell lines and three KO clones per cell line ( Fig. 2A-D) . As control cells, we included the parental cell lines (A549; HLE) and two WT single cell clones for each cell line that had undergone clonal selection at the same time as the KO clones. We compared the proliferation between WT and KO clones, but could not detect any significant differences in bromodeoxyuridine assays ( Fig. 2A and C) . Additionally, the cell cycle profiles did not significantly differ between WT and KO clones . On average, MALAT1 shows a 2.5-fold higher expression (p < 0.001) in these cell lines compared with the abundant housekeeping gene RpLp0 (B, right panel). (c) To deplete the highly abundant lncRNA MALAT1, a knockout approach was recently developed 41 that is schematically explained here. (D) This method allowed the generation of A549 (lung) and hLe (liver) single cell clones that showed a ~1000-fold or ~200-fold reduction of full-length MALAT1, respectively.

However, within the resolution provided by our CLSM analysis, wildtype and knockout cells displayed no significant structural differences with respect to SC35 immunofluorescence (Fig.  3E) . Upon close inspection of confocal three dimensional stacks, it appeared that in some knockout cells the borders of the SC35 domains were slightly more diffuse than in wildtype cells.

For the construction of the Malat1 knockout targeting vector, a previously published methodology and protocol was adjusted and used. 48 Briefly, short 500 bp homology arms (one 7 kb upstream of the Malat1 transcription start (5'-arm) and one 1.9 kb downstream of the Malat1 transcript (3'-arm) were amplified by PCR with BAC clone RP24_290K10 as template DNA and inserted via restriction/ligation into the pKoII vector backbone. The BAC clone was electroporated into the recombination-competent E. coli strain SW106. 48 The bacteria are available from the NCI Frederick (https://notendur.hi.is/bmo/Recombineering%20 Website.htm). The bacteria were transformed with the XhoI/Sal1 linearized pKoII vector. In the bacteria, the Malat1 locus with the 7 kb upstream and the 1.9 kb downstream areas was recombined into the pKoII vector backbone. Genomic sequences directly downstream of the murine Malat1 gene were amplified by PCR and inserted in front and behind the FRT-Neo-FRT-loxP cassette human and murine knockout models presented here now allow the in-depth analysis whether MALAT1 might also represent an active player in the metastatic cascade despite not being an essential gene for life and development.",

The 5'-arm-FRT-Neo-FRT-loxP-3'-arm fragment was excised by KpnI, SacII and ApaL1 and recombined downstream of the Malat1 gene into the pKoII vector. Restriction by SpeI and ligation of the loxP double-stranded oligonucleotide 5' of the Malat1 transcription start in the pKoII vector completed the Malat1 knockout targeting construct which was verified by sequencing.The (5'-arm-loxP-Malat1-FRT-Neo-FRT-loxP-3'-arm) targeting vector was linearized by NotI and electroporated into the embryonic stem cell (ES) line V6.5 (SV129 x Bl6 F1 hybrid). G418-resistant ES clones were screened for correct homologous recombination at the Malat1 locus via colony PCR and Southern Blot analysis. For the colony PCR reaction, the following primer sequences were used: neo forward 5'-TTC TGA GGG GAT CAA TTC TCT AGA GCT CGC-3'(located in the neo gene sequence) and wt reverse 5'-CTC ACC TGG AAC CCT CTA TGT AGA ACA GC-3' (located immediately downstream and outside of the targeting vector within the wildtype sequence). In case of correct homologous recombination of the targeting vector, a 2420 bp PCR fragment was amplified (Fig. 4B) . For Southern Blot analysis, the external probe 2 was generated by PCR amplification of genomic sequence using the primers fwd_probe2 (5'-AGC TCT GAG TGC CTG TTT CTG-3') and rev_probe2 (5'-ATG CTC TCT CCC ACA TGA CC-3'). The resulting 680 bp fragment was subcloned and used for conventional Southern Blotting using established protocols. Genomic DNA isolated from ES cell clones was digested with BamHI and XhoI; hybridization with the [ 32 P]-labeled probe 2 produced a 10.6 kb BamHI/BamHI wildtype signal and a 4.1 kb XhoI/BamHI signal in case of correct targeting of the Malat1 locus (Fig. 4C) .Positive ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts derived from C57Bl/6J mice (Charles River), and chimeric animals were set up for breeding with wildtype C57Bl/6J mice to identify animals transmitting the correctly targeted Malat1 locus via the germ line. The heterozygous Malat1loxP,FRTNeo/+ mice generated from the ES cell clones were crossed with a transgenic CMV-Cre deleter line (in a C57Bl/6J genetic background) to remove the PGK-Neo selection cassette and the complete Malat1 gene, which was confirmed by PCR ( Fig. 4D and below) . As a result, nucleotides 5795370-5802920 from mouse chromosome 19qA (Assembly NCBI37/mm9) consisting of the complete 6982 nt Malat1 transcript sequence plus 251 nt upstream of the Malat1 transcription start site and 322 nt downstream of the Malat1 transcript end were removed.Genotyping of constitutive Malat1 knockout mice. A threeprimer-PCR strategy was used for genotyping the constitutive Malat1 knockout mice. Primer 1 (5'-CAC TCT GGG AAT GTT TTT GG-3'), Primer 2 (5'-CAG GAA AAC GCA AAA GGT GT-3') and Primer 3 (5'-TGT CGA AAA GAG GTG GTG TG-3') as indicated in Figure 4D (10 \u03bcM each) produced a 120 bp fragment for the wild-type allele and a 204 bp fragment",
