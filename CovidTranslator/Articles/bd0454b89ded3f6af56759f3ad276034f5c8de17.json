Astroviruses have been detected in fecal samples from a wide variety of mammals and birds that are associated with gastroenteritis and extra enteric manifestations. In the present study, RT-PCR was used to investigate the presence of MAstV5 in 269 dog fecal samples. MAstV5 was detected in 26% (71/269) of the samples. Interestingly, all MAstV5-positive samples derived from dogs displaying clinical signs suggestive of gastroenteritis, other enteric viruses were simultaneously detected (canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine adenovirus and canine rotavirus). Based on genomic sequence analysis of MAstV5 a novel classification of the species into four genotypes, MAstV5a-MAstV5d, is proposed.",

            "text": "Viruses belonging to the Astroviridae (AstV) family are spherical, non-enveloped, 28-30 nm in size, with a surface that forms a characteristic star-like structure. 1 The RNA genome of AstV ranges from 6.8 to 7.9-kb in size, polyadenylated at the 3 end, and contains three ORFs designated as ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. ORF1a encodes a protease, ORF1b encodes an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, 2,3 while ORF2 encodes the viral capsid structural polyprotein that is required for virion assembly. 4 The viral classification was previously based on the host and consisted of two genera, Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus. However, recent characterization of novel astroviruses has taken in consideration that isolates from different animal species can be genetically similar, while genetically diverse viruses can be isolated from the same animal species. 2 Based on this analysis, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed canine astrovirus as Mamastrovirus 5 (MAstV5). 5 Astroviruses have been detected in fecal samples from a wide variety of mammals and birds that are associated with gastroenteritis. 2 In children, AstVs are the second most common cause of gastroenteritis after rotaviruses. 2, 6 Human AstVs can also cause significant disease in the elderly 7 and immune-compromised patients. 8, 9 In addition to enteric manifestations, AstVs have been associated with fatal hepatitis in ducks, 10 interstitial nephritis in young chickens, 11 stunting and pre hatching mortality in duck and goose embryos, 12 as well as shaking mink syndrome 13 . Recently, an AstV was also hypothesized to be the causative agent of nonsuppurative encephalitis in cattle. 14 Since the 1980s, astrovirus-like particles have been reported in dogs with and without diarrhea. [15] [16] [17] To date, canine astroviruses or astrovirus-like particles infecting dogs have been reported in several countries. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Despite the detection of MAstV5 in association with gastroenteritis in dogs, which suggests a possible role for MAstV5 as a canine enteric pathogen, the association of MAstV5 with clinical disease remains obscure in such reports. Here, we investigated the presence of MAstV5 using RT-PCR in fecal samples from dogs of different ages with and without diarrhea. The partial genomes of selected MAstV5 RNA-positive samples were also sequenced to perform a phylogenetic analysis comparing them with the MAstV5 sequences described in the literature as the cause of enteric disease. 18, 20, 23, 26 Additionally, MAstV5 was proposed to be classified in four putative genotypes.",

Samples were diluted to 20% (w/v) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C for further analysis.

            "text": "Here, in a screening of dog fecal samples, 26% (71/269) of the dogs with and without diarrhea were MAstV5 positive, as determined using RT-PCR. Likewise, non-viral agents and factors such as bacteria, intestinal parasites, malnutrition and intoxications are able to promote enteric disease mainly in the young dog population. The search for other enteric viruses in the MAstV5-positive samples from dogs with gastroenteritis showed that the dogs were also infected with other known pathogens. Moreover, we found that single MAstV5 infection was associated only with the asymptomatic state, although there is a risk that the results will be biased, since the analyzes were conducted on the basis of convenience sampling and we can not exclude the possibility that the long term of viral shedding could be an explanation for the MAstV5-positive samples detected in asymptomatic dogs, based on previous study that demonstrated the comparison between virus load and clinical manifestation 26 (Fig. 1 and Table 3 ). These findings were not unexpected, as mixed infections are common, but more studies will be necessary to real deduce the role of MAstV5 in the cases reported here. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Several reports of MAstV5 suggest a clinical association of virus molecular detection and diseased dog clinical samples. 18, [20] [21] [22] [23] 26, 33 Furthermore, studies of the prevalence of MAstV5 in China showed that 12% (22/183) of the puppies displaying clinical signs of diarrhea were positive for MAstV5, as determined using RT-PCR, compared to none of 138 healthy dogs, although these studies did not look for other viruses that may be associated with diarrhea. 19 In a study conducted in Italy, 24% of 110 stool samples collected from dogs with clinical signs tested positive for the presence of MAstV5 RNA, and 9% (10/110) of the samples showed an MAstV5single infection, although other asymptomatic animals (9% of 75) were also positive for MAstV5 33 . Therefore, the association with clinical signs and the shedding of the virus was described only in a case study of 2 animals, which is apparently an isolated case. 26 A prevalence study in France found that 21% (66/316) of the puppies in 42% (14/33) of the breeding kennels surveyed were MAstV5 positive, as determined using RT-PCR. 21 In the same report, the authors observed that puppies that were less than 7 weeks old were especially susceptible to MAstV5 infection, although a direct association with clinical signs was not possible. 21 Lastly, recent studies found a MAstV5 prevalence of 6% in the United Kingdom and an infection rate of 33% in puppies under three months in Japan. 22, 23 The partial genomic sequencing and characterization of selected samples revealed a remarkable genetic heterogeneity of MAstV5 of Brazilian origin. Because it was hypothesized that two strains of human AstV with less than 95% identity at the nucleotide level are serologically distinguishable, 34 the lower identities (<85%) shown between the capsid gene sequences analyzed here may reflect the need for a novel species classification into four genotypes -MAstV5a to MAstV5d. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the four MAstV5 strains reported here represent a lineage that is more closely related to the Chinese strains than to the others strains, based on the high sequence identity (97%) of ORF2, according to the species demarcation criteria established by the ICTV 5 ( Table 2) .",
