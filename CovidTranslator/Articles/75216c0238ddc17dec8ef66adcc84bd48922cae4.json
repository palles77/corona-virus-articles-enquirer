Accurately reconstructed evolutionary features on specific functional 24 domains can in turn provide biological information on viral protein and immune targets for 25 vaccine design. In this study we developed and evaluated a structurally informed partitioning 26 scheme that accounts for rate variation among immunogenic head and stalk domains of the 27 surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza viruses. We evaluated the model fit and 28 performance of four different models -HKY, SRD06 codon, HKY with a structurally informed 29 partitioning scheme, SRD06 with a structurally informed partitioning scheme on pandemic 30 A/H1N1pdm09, seasonal A/H1N1postpdm, A/H3N2, B-Yamagata-like and Victoria-like 31 lineages, and two highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses H5Nx and H7N9. Results showed 32 that structurally informed partitioning with SRD06 performed better for all datasets with 33 decisively statistical support. Significantly faster nucleotide substitution rates for head domain, 34 compared to stalk domain was observed and may provide insight for stalk derived broadly-35 reactive vaccine design. Taken together, integrating a functionally informed partitioning scheme 36 based on protein structures of immune targets allows for significant improvement of 37 phylogenetic analysis and providing important biological insights.",

Therefore, how to partition on the 229 protein structure with genetic data is critical. One solution is to compare all possible partitioning 230 schemes for a given genetic sequence dataset to find the best partitioning strategy (3). However, (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, and H17) and Group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14 287 and H15) (25), respectively, it is probably amongst the most promising approaches to design a 288 universal influenza vaccine. 289 While this model has been developed with influenza in mind, there is potential to apply 290 this approach to other viruses.

However, assuming natural selection acts uniformly 51 across the protein domains may not be justified (9). Some partitioning strategies have been 52 developed to account for variations inside one gene segment (3,10).

            "text": "231 this approach is computationally inflexible because the combination of possible partitioning 232 schemes is tremendous even for a very small number of data blocks (20). Consequently, many 233 previous studies ended up either arbitrarily choosing a single partitioning scheme or just 234 selecting the best scheme based on statistical model selection (3,21,22). With these limitations on 235 proper partitioning, the accuracy of the inferences from partitioned phylogenetic analysis 236 remains uncertain, even though advanced developments in phylogenetic analysis have been 237 achieved in recent decades (3). Due to advanced progress in viral protein structure (23), 238 partitioning scheme in this study is based on biological functions of different protein domains, 239 where HA protein has been defined to distinguish the immunogenic roles and other molecular-240 level functions during viral infection. Molecular mechanism of influenza viruses, for example, 241 the initiation of viral fusion or antigenic-immune stimulation, is determined by the head domain 242 of the protein. Nucleic acid changes observed in this domain usually result from a balance 243 between immune selection and conserved functionality (24-26). The new partitioning model 244 considers the distinctive functions of head domain to mainly bind to host-cell receptors and the 245 stalk domain to perform membrane fusion. HME) and Akaike's information criterion through MCMC (AICM) (28) have been 250 commonly used. In recent years, several new approaches to perform model selection in the field 251 of phylogenetics, such as path-sampling (PS) (29) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) (30). Baele 252 et al. (31) have tested HME, AICM, PS, and SS approaches for demographic and molecular 253 clock model comparison, which \"confirmed that HME systematically overestimates the marginal 254 likelihood and fails to yield reliable model classification, and PS and SS substantially outperform 255 HME estimators\" (32). Therefore, in this study both PS and SS approaches have been used to 256 perform the model selection procedure to generate reliable results of model comparison. 257 The new model with both partitioning on codon positions and protein structure 258 incorporates biological functional domains inside one protein to allow for a quantitative 259 exportation of the evolutionary process as a function of approximate host immune selection. The 260 model did capture the different evolutionary process of these functional domains, which showed 261 that the stalk domain had a significantly lower substitution rates and lower dC1+2/dC3, indicating 262 that the stalk domain experienced stronger purifying selection and maintained its conserved 263 functionality. The estimated domain-specific dC1+2/dC3 can reveal insights of selection pressure 264 on different viral isolates in different host populations. For example, diversifying selection 265 pressure on the head domain has been observed only in chicken population in Egypt. One 266 possible explanation could be that the failed efficacy of poultry influenza H5 vaccines 267 implemented in Egypt (33,34) may drive the genetic diversity of the viruses in the of a full codon or amino acid models (10). When assuming synonymous 273 changes do not affect viral fitness, the dC1+2/dC3 value can provide corresponding estimation for 274 selection pressure compared to mutation-selection models which assess the strength of natural 275 selection on specific mutations (35). Furthermore, the partitioning scheme and additional 276 parameter estimation did not significantly increase the analysis run time compared to other 277 models in this study under the same computing environment. 278 The structurally informed evolutionary model may provide insight for universal vaccine 279 design. The higher rates observed in the head domain are probably due to strong immune 280 selection targeted on the globular head, where some sites are mostly targeted by the neutralizing 281 immunity induced by seasonal influenza vaccine (13). Supported by many laboratory studies, 282 stalk domain could be used to induce more broad-reactive vaccines (13,15,17). This model can 283 more accurately reconstruct the ancestral sequence of the stalk domain with estimating domain-284 specific rates and substitution patterns under a shared viral phylogeny.

Conversely, studies in the 67 ferret experimental model demonstrate that the stalk domain is highly conserved across IAV 68 subtypes and stalk specific antibodies could provide cross-reactive protection to a high diversity 69 of IAV subtypes (13,15).
