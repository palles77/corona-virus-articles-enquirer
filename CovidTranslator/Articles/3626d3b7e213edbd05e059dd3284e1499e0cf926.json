The reader should seek more current information on diagnosis, treatment and prevention. In December 2019, Wuhan, Hubei province, China, one of the six megalopolises with a population of 14 million, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. Because the early cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Market, the market was shut down on January 1, 2020. One week later, on January 7, 2020, Chinese health authorities confirmed that they had identified a novel coronavirus The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued an epidemic update and risk assessment of COVID-19 in late January. 4 The document describes evidence regarding what is known about the causative pathogen, the epidemiology and clinical features of the illness, diagnosis and management essentials, and public prevention measures. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention provided practical guidance for the public to protect themselves from the infection, including a recommendation (issued on January 27, 2020) that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to China. 5 ",

On January 24, 2020, Huang et al 10 reported in The Lancet on the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics, as well as treatment and outcomes, of the virus. An understanding of the clinical features will help clinicians to recognize the infected patients and minimize the risk of exposure to others. It was inferred that the target cells might be in the lower airway, due to features of presentation such as the lack of prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms and the ground-glass opacities on chest CT images. Older male subjects with comorbidities have been reported to have more severe and even fatal respiratory diseases. 11 Additional studies will help in assessing for host risk factors for disease severity and mortality. Laboratory evaluation has found lymphopenia in 63% of patients and a cytokine storm profile in those who are critically ill. The combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant immune response may have an impact on the severity of illness, similar to what has been proven in SARS and MERS. 10 Translational research may discover biomarkers and other cofactor triggers in infected patients with different risk stratification.",

In a historical control study, a combination of protease inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir) was associated with substantial clinical benefit among patients with SARS-CoV. 17 Results from in vitro cell and in vivo animal studies suggest that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-b1 may be effective against MERS-CoV. A placebo-controlled trial of interferon-b1 and lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated in patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS requiring hospital admission in Saudi Arabia. 18 Remdesivir, a 1 0 -cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, may be evaluated. 19 The first reported patient with COVID-19 infection in the United States was administered remdesivir. Based on worsening clinical status, IV remdesivir was given for compassionate use on hospital day 7 (illness day 11). 20 Two randomized controlled trials have been registered to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in mild/ moderate or severe patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. 21, 22 Kirchdoerfer and Ward 23 noticed that nonstructural proteins (nsp)12 polymerase may be a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutic agents to interrupt the assembly of the SARS-CoV core RNA-synthesis machinery. COVID-19 has full-length genome sequences with > 75% nucleotide identity with that of SARS-CoV, 7 which allows the molecular e2 Editorial structure information to be used as a model for coronavirus antiviral design.

It is of great significance to share what is known of COVID-19 genome sequences, the epidemiology, and clinical features of the illness. In this social media era, when an epidemic occurs, a great deal of misinformation is readily available. 24 Hopefully, the early suggestion that COVID-19 infection is of lower lethality than SARS holds true. In contrast, a low health threat on the individual level means there is potential to cause disruptions of global public health systems and a long duration of person-to-person transmissibility. Mild illnesses and asymptomatic carriers may be potential sources of infection, sustaining a local epidemic and global spread. To reduce panic and economic loss, and to manage and save the infected, much remains to be done. The goal is to break the transmission chain of COVID-19. This will require effective programs to trace, diagnose, and cure every infected patient. We all need to be aware of the risks of another zoonotic virus crossing species to infect the human population in the future. It is of great imperative that we call for global action to deal with this major public health emergency.",

            "text": "). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization Director-General made the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding the outbreak in China, with exportations to other countries.1 As of mid-February, > 50,000 cases with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 have been detected in China, of whom > 1,600 have died. It has spread to all 34 provinces in China within 1 month. The Spring Festival travel rush, in which an estimated 5 million people traveled from Wuhan to throughout the country, was one of the key factors that led to the rapid intercity spread. Approximately 680 exported cases of COVID-19 infection have been reported in > 25 countries.This outbreak is the third time in the past two decades that a zoonotic coronavirus has crossed species to infect humans. During the epidemics of the other two beta-SARS outbreak, Chinese health authorities have taken rapid measures to isolate suspected or confirmed patients, trace and quarantine their close contacts, educate the public on both food and personal hygiene, and alert and train health-care workers on compliance with infection control against emerging pathogens.",
