A detailed scientific analysis of this phenomenon is still to come, but now it is urgently needed to evaluate the parameters of the disease dynamics in order to make some preliminary estimations of the number of cases and possible duration of the pandemic. The corresponding mathematical models must be simple enough, since their parameters are unknown and have to be estimated using limited statistical data sets. The SIR model, statistical approach to the parameter identification and the official WHO daily data about the confirmed cumulative number of cases were used to calculate the SIR curves and make some estimations and predictions. New cases in Italy could stop to appear after May 12, 2020, and the final number of such accumulated cases could be around 112 thousand. Some prospects for the global pandemic dynamics are discussed.",

            "text": "Here, we consider the development of epidemic outbreak in Italy caused by coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) (see e.g., [1] ). Some investigations of the epidemic spreading in mainland China [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] could be useful to understand the epidemic outbreak in other countries, since we deal with the same pathogen. A preliminary comparison of the epidemic dynamics in Italy and in mainland China has been done in [8, 9] . In [10] the global coronavirus epidemic dynamics was analyzed. In this paper we will use the official WHO daily data [1] for the confirmed accumulated number of patients (victims) V(t) (number of persons who caught the infection and got sick; t is time measured in days), the SIR model [11] [12] [13] [14] and the statistics-based method of parameter identification [14] in order to calculate the pandemic characteristics and to make some estimations and predictions. 2  9  2036  2732  64  5753   3  10  2502  3367  108  7341   4  11  3089  4307  129  8993   5  12  3858  5820  148  11197   6  13  4636  7491  213  14347   7  14  5883  9453  213  17593   8  15  7375  12242  213  21291   9  16  9172  15130  472  25265   10  17  10149  18124  696  29609   11  18  12462  23112  987  36410   12  19  15113  28892  1264  43788   13  20  17660  36263  1678  53427   14  21  21157  45060  1678 All rights reserved.
