However, when the patient who visited the outpatient clinic in Mediheal Hospital was reported to be a confirmed case on June 11, twentytwo patients on maintenance hemodialysis at Mediheal Hospital were transferred to nearby hemodialysis facilities. From that moment, the Korean Society of Nephrology together with the Korean Society of Dialysis Therapy expressed great concern about the possibility of the rapid spread of MERS-CoV infection via hemodialysis facilities. Therefore, on June 17 of 2015, a joint committee of the Korean Society of Nephrology and Korean Society of Dialysis Therapy promptly presented a draft about 'Clinical recommendations for dealing with hemodialysis patients associated with MERS-CoV infection' . The key recommendations are summarized in Table 1 .",

First, all health-care workers, hemodialysis patients and caregivers should perform standard, contact, and droplet precautions, including hand hygiene and wearing masks. Second, the screening desk or quarantine clinic should be operated to check body temperature and respiratory symptoms before patients enter the hemodialysis unit. If a patient on maintenance hemodialysis develops a fever or respiratory symptoms, he/she should notify the health-care workers as soon as possible. It is most important not to allow suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infected patients into the hemodialysis unit. Third, to minimize contact between suspected or confirmed cases and other hemodialysis patients in the waiting room, it is highly recommended to operate the hemodialysis clinic by subscription and to educate patients to observe treatment hours. Next, to prevent nosocomial transmission in hemodialysis facilities, it is recommended that adequate space between beds be maintained. Lastly, inter-hospital transfer is basically prohibited during a nation-wide epidemic, such as a MERS-CoV outbreak. If a referral to another hospital is inevitable, a staff member from the relevant hemodialysis unit should discuss the referral issue with the head of the community health center beforehand.

As shown in the MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia, hemodialysis patients can easily spread the disease through the narrow space between beds due to the passive nature of dialysis therapy. In the previous report, a total of 21 out of 23 confirmed cases were acquired by person-to-person transmission in a hemodialysis unit [3] . Aside from environmental factors, patients with chronic kidney disease showed a higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared to those without chronic kidney disease (odds ratio 5.84, 95% confidence interval 1.48-23.0, P = 0.012) [5] . Therefore, early detection of confirmed cases and appropriate infection control measures are very important to prevent further transmission of the disease in a dialysis facility. During the MERS outbreak in South Korea in 2015, a total of 186 confirmed patients with MERS-CoV infection were identified from 16 hospitals. Among them, only one dialysis patient was reported to be a confirmed patient with no further transmission or in-hospital mortality in the dialysis unit. This monumental record is due to the pre-emptive action taken by the Korean Society of Nephrology together with the KCDC to prevent viral transmission as well as unpaid care provided by volunteers and related medical corporations. In addition, the joint committee of the Korean Society of Nephrology and Korean Society of Dialysis Therapy took immediate steps to establish clinical recommendations and guidelines to confront current epidemics and ensure readiness for future events.",
