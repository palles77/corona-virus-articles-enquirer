            "text": "With the growing emergence of pan-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDR-Ab) strains in clinical, new strategies for the treatment of PDR-Ab infections are urgently needed. Egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) as a convenient and inexpensive antibody has been widely applied to the therapy of infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to produce IgY specific to PDR-Ab and investigate its antibacterial effects in vitro and in vivo. IgYs specific to two PDR-Ab strains were produced by immunizing hens with formaldehyde inactivated PDR-Ab cells and isolated from yolks with a purity of 90% by water dilution, salt precipitations and ultrafiltration. IgYs showed high titers when subjected to an ELISA and inhibited the growth of PDR-Ab in a dose-dependent manner in liquid medium. Scanning electron microscopy assay showed structural modification and aggregation of PDR-Ab treated with specific IgYs. Freshly cultured PDR-Ab cells were nasally inhaled in BALB/c mice to induce acute pneumonia. The infected mice were intraperitoneally injected with specific IgYs using cefoperazone/sulbactam and dexamethasone as positive controls. The IgYs specific to PDR-Ab lowered the mortality of mice with PDR-Ab-induced acute pneumonia, decreased the level of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in serum and reduced inflammation in lung tissue. Specific IgY has the potential to be used as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of A. baumannii-induced infections.",

But the values of specific IgYs-treated mice were significantly lower than those of positive control and negative control mice (p < 0.05). After 6 h of treatment, TNF-\u03b1 in specific IgYs-treated mice recoverd to normal level. The amounts of TNF-\u03b1 in cefoperazone/sulbactam or dexamethason-treated mice were still in high level, but were much lower than that in negative control mice (p < 0.05). The levels of IL-1\u03b2 changed in a similar trend (Table 3 ). These results indicated that specific IgYs could (p < 0.05) decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PDR-Ab -infected mice.

The tested strain Ab-C used in this study was one of the above PDR-Ab. The other A. baumannii strain Ab-B used here was also determined to be PDR-Ab by the same test. Generally, carbapenem antibacterial is the first choice for PDR-Ab infection [31] . After the first nosocomial carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CR-AB) strain was reported in 1991, CR-AB strains have been shown in increasing documents [32] . It was reported that 74% of A. baumannii were MDR-Ab and 55% of A. baumannii were resistant to imipenem [29] . Several mechanisms are responsible for the resistance of CR-AB, among which production of oxacillinases (OXA enzymes) is important one [29, 33] . We have documented that the PDR-Ab strains used in this study were resistant to meropenem, a new carbapenem antibacterial, and were positive for OXA-23, 51 and 58 enzymes [22] . So, the two MDR-Ab strains are suitable for estimating the activity of new antibacterial agents against A. baumannii.",

On a whole, the inhibitory effect of IgYs on Ab-C was weaker than on Ab-B. Isolated from clinical sample, Ab-C is resistant to antibacterial on a wider and stronger degree. Therefore, we used the Ab-C as a model-building strain for murine acute pneumonia. In our study, SEM assay indicated that specific IgYs enhanced the agglutination of MDR-Ab. It was reported that IgY could enhance the agglutination of bacteria causing a reduction in CFU rather than actual direct effects on individual bacteria [36] . SEM assay also showed cell crenation and structural modification on the surface of specific IgYstreated bacteria. These resulted from the combination of IgY with bacteria, and might reduce the attachment of bacteria on mucosa.

After infection, the quantity of macrophages in local infected tissue increased by recruitment of circulating monocytes and/or in situ proliferation. The activated macrophages with pro-inflammatory phenotype produce various pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which play a central role in the inflammatory process [40] [41] [42] [43] . IgY binding may alter the electron cloud and/or electric field on the bacterial surface [44] , and consequently increase vulnerability of the bacteria cells to phagocytosis. Our previous study demonstrated that specific IgY increased the phagocytosis of S. aureus by milk macrophages [45] . Nie et al. revealed that IgY improved the phagocytosis of S. aureus by neutrophils [46] . In this study, though the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in all model mice, the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in specific IgYstreated mice were much lower and recovered to normal more rapidly than those in other groups. We inferred that IgY might improve the phagocytosis of macrophages to PDR-Ab, as a result, the quantity of macrophage recruited and activated in infected tissue decreased and the pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages reduced.",

Cefoperazone/sulbactam, a compound preparation of cephalosporin and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, showed stronger antibacterial activity than specific IgYs in vitro. But its death prevention and anti-inflammatory effects in vivo were much lower than those of specific IgYs. Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, showed no death prevention effect and a little anti-inflammatory effect in mice with acute pneumonia. But the down-regulation effects of dexamethasone to TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were not comparable with those of specific IgYs. Based on above, specific IgYs are more effective than cefoperazone/sulbactam and dexamethasone against PDR-Ab in vitro and in vivo. Considering its other advantages together, specific IgY may be a promising substitution of the current antibacterials.",
