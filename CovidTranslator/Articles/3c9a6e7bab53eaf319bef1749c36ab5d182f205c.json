Th e frequency of exacerbations varies widely between patients. Th ough severity of airfl ow obstruction is correlated with the frequency of exacerbations, other yet poorly understood factors predispose some patients to have more frequent exacerbations.",

Following an exacerbation, acute symptoms usually subside over 2-3 weeks, however, quality of life indices takes several months to return to baseline. Furthermore, recurrent exacerbations are clearly associated with a more rapid decline in quality of life in COPD [6] . Based on studies performed by Fletcher and Peto in the 1960s it was widely believed that exacerbations do not contribute to the decline in lung function (measured as FEV 1 ). Recent data has disputed these results and shown that the frequency of exacerbations is associated with accelerated long-term decline in lung function, in both mild COPD and more advanced diseases [7, 8] .",

Substantial progress has been made in understanding their etiology and pathogenesis of exacerbations. In contrast, such richness of data is unfortunately missing in the fi eld of clinical management of exacerbations. Major modalities used to treat exacerbations include bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Only for systemic corticosteroid use in severe exacerbations requiring emergency room care or hospitalization is the adequate clinical trial data available. Adequately powered, well-designed clinical trials studies for the other modalities used to treat exacerbations are relatively few. Consequently, whether the use of antibiotics for exacerbations is appropriate is still debated and whether antibiotic choice makes a diff erence is even more controversial [9, 10] .",

Unfortunately, for exacerbations of COPD, the current defi nitions are imprecise, variable, and lack objective measures [11] . Th ere are two widely used defi nitions of exacerbation. In 1987, in a large placebo-controlled trial in exacerbations of COPD, Anthonisen and colleagues defi ned exacerbations based on the presence of one or more of the three cardinal symptoms, including an increase or new onset of dyspnea, sputum production, and sputum purulence [12] . When only one cardinal symptom is present, then one or more supporting symptoms or signs are required to make the diagnosis, including an upper respiratory tract infection in the past 5 days, wheezing, cough, fever without an obvious source, or a 20% increase in the respiratory rate or heart rate above baseline. Th ough simple and clinically useful, this defi nition does have several limitations. It is narrow in its scope, and several important symptoms of exacerbation such as cough, chest congestion, chest tightness, fatigue, and sleep disturbance are not included. It is subjective, however, that limitation applies to all defi nitions of exacerbations as reliable objective measures of exacerbations are currently unavailable.",

A severe exacerbation may therefore be assessed when a patient with very severe underlying COPD has a relatively small change from his baseline, or when a patient with mild COPD has much larger acute change in his symptoms and lung function.

With simpler measures, such as peak fl ow, often the change with an exacerbation is of the same magnitude as its day-to-day variability. Severity has been also measured by site of care, with hospitalized exacerbations regarded as severe, outpatient exacerbations regarded as moderate and self medicated exacerbations as mild [14] . Site of care is unreliable as a measure of exacerbation severity. Th ough the major factor determining site of care is undoubtedly illness severity, it is also dependent on diff erences in hospital admission practices among countries and health care systems, patient reporting of exacerbations, physician preferences, etc. Th e intensity of recommended treatment has also been used as a measure of severity of exacerbations, with treatment with bronchodilators only indicating mild exacerbations, while treatment with antibiotics and steroids in addition to bronchodilators regarded as indicating moderate or severe exacerbations.

In another study of multiple serum biomarkers in 20 hospitalized patients with exacerbation, reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) correlated with decrease in dyspnea during recovery from exacerbation, while decreases in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1 ) were proportional to recovery in FEV 1 [16] .

Airway infl ammation measured in induced or expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsy has revealed that increased infl ammation accompanies exacerbations and resolves with treatment [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Both neutrophilic and eosinophilic infl ammations have been described. Th is acute increase in airway infl ammation leads to increased bronchial tone, edema in the bronchial wall and mucus production. In a diseased lung, these processes worsen ventilation-perfusion mismatch and expiratory fl ow limitation. Clinically, these pathophysiologic changes present as an increase in or new onset of dyspnea, cough, sputum production, tenacity and purulence along with worsening gas exchange, which are the cardinal manifestations of an exacerbation. Infl ammation in exacerbations extends beyond the lung, and increased plasma fi brinogen, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and CRP have been described during exacerbations [18, 26, 27] . Th ese and other mediators likely cause the systemic manifestations of exacerbations, including fatigue and in some instances fever. Th e etiology of exacerbations appears to determine the nature and degree of infl ammation in exacerbations. Neutrophilic infl ammation is characteristic of bacterial exacerbations, while both neutrophilic and eosinophilic infl ammations have been described with viral infection [28] . Th e intensity of neutrophilic infl ammation, when measured as associated cytokines/chemokines (IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 ) and products of neutrophil degranulation (NE and myeloperoxidase), is much greater in well-characterized bacterial exacerbations than exacerbations of nonbacterial etiology [18] . Systemic infl ammation, measured as serum CRP is also more intense in bacterial exacerbations [18] . Th ese fi ndings have important implications. Th ey can form the basis for biomarkers to distinguish etiology of exacerbations in a reliable and rapid manner, facilitating appropriate therapy. Th e heightened airway and systemic infl ammation with bacterial exacerbations can be potentially damaging to the lungs. Eff ective antibiotic therapy to eradicate the bacteria responsible for exacerbations and reduce the infl ammation to baseline levels becomes desirable and could have potential long-term benefi ts in COPD.",

Th e current model of bacterial exacerbation pathogenesis involves both host and pathogen factors ( Fig. 53.1 ) . Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment is the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation [13] . Variation among strains of a species in the surface antigenic structure, as is seen with NTHI, S. pneumoniae , M. catarrhalis , and P. aeruginosa , is crucial to the development of recurrent exacerbations with these pathogens. Th is variation allows these newly acquired strains to escape the pre-existing host immune response that had developed following prior exposure to other strains of the same species. Th ese newly acquired strains can therefore proliferate in the lower airways and induce acute infl ammation. Th e virulence of the strain and as yet unidentifi ed host factors may determine if the acute infl ammatory response to the pathogen reaches the threshold to cause symptoms that present as an exacerbation [40] . In the majority of instances, mucosal and systemic antibodies develop to the pathogen [41, 42] . Th is immune response, in combination with appropriate antibiotics, eliminates or controls proliferation of the infecting bacteria. However, because of antigenic variability among strains of these bacterial species, these antibodies directed at the infecting strain are usually strain-specifi c, and do not protect the host from antigenically distinct strains of the same species. Th is allows recurrent bacterial infection and exacerbations in these patients.",

Bronchial epithelial cells obtained from patients with asthma have diminished production of interferons and increased ICAM-1 expression, changes which could result in increased infl ammation, cell lysis, and viral replication on viral infection. Increased ICAM-1 expression in COPD bronchial epithelium has been seen, however the other changes have not been described.",

Most exacerbations nowadays are treated without obtaining sputum bacteriology and with the trend to short course antibiotic therapy, this initial empiric choice often becomes the only choice made of antibiotics in exacerbations. Results of antibiotic comparison trials should guide the recommendations for appropriate empiric antibiotics in exacerbations. However, though the literature is replete with such trials, in the vast majority, antibiotic choice does not apparently aff ect the clinical outcome. However, diff erences in bacteriological eradication rates among antibiotics are seen, with a dissociation between clinical and bacteriological outcomes [62] . Th ese results are contrary to expectations that antibiotics with better in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial effi cacy and better pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics should show superior clinical outcomes. A closer examination of the trial design of these studies reveals several shortcomings that off er potential explanations for this paradox ( Table 53 .5 ) [53] . Many of these defi ciencies are related to the fact that these trials are performed for regulatory approval of the drugs, therefore are designed for demonstrating noninferiority rather than diff erences between the two antibiotics. In the face of this large body of data showing clinical equivalence, it is not surprising that several guidelines do not diff erentiate between antibiotics for therapy of exacerbations.",

            "text": "Patients with COPD exacerbation often experience a change in the color of sputum from white or gray (mucoid) to yellow, green or brown (purulent). Purulence of sputum is related to the presence of myeloperoxidase, a product of neutrophil degranulation. Neutrophil degranulation is associated with bacterial infection, therefore sputum purulence at exacerbation is a marker of bacterial infection, defi ned by quantitative cultures of sputum and bronchoscopic protected brush specimens [75, 76] . Presence of sputum purulence has been advocated as the sole determinant for antibiotic treatment of exacerbations. However, its accuracy and reproducibility as an indicator of bacterial infection is limited, and is likely to be even more so in clinical practice than in research studies [75, 76] . Often, patients have purulent sputum production even when stable, have intermittent purulent sputum production during exacerbation, or have not have observed the sputum color. Sputum purulence is one of the cardinal Anthonisen criteria, and we recommend it should be used in conjunction with other symptoms and other measures of risk stratifi cation in antibiotic treatment of exacerbations ( Fig 53. 2 ). Utilization of biomarkers to rapidly identify bacterial exacerbations and to guide antibiotic use is another potential approach in exacerbations. Several potential biomarkers have been identifi ed in sputum and serum. Th e best studied biomarker of bacterial infection is serum procalcitonin level. In a recent study in patients hospitalized for exacerbations, antibiotic treatment was only recommended if the procalcitonin level was above a certain threshold. Th ere was no diff erence in outcomes in spite of reduction in antibiotic use from 72% to 40% with procalcitonin guidance [77] . However, this approach needs to be validated in multi-center trials with varied populations before widespread application [78] . Furthermore, it needs to be tested in outpatients which represent the majority of exacerbations treated, where patients are not as closely supervised and other supportive care is less rigorous. Only a minority of patients received a fl uoroquinolone in this study, which should have been the antibiotics of choice in these complicated patients. Th erefore, the lack of eff ect of withholding antibiotics could have been related to their relative inefficacy in the fi rst place. In this study, short-term goals as well as biologic goals of bacterial eradication and infl ammation reduction as discussed above were also not recorded.",
