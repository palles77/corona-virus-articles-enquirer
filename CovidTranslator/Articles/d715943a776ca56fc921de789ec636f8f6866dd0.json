            "text": "The Ebola virus disease outbreak highlighted the lack of consistent guidelines and training for workers outside of hospital settings. Specifically, emergency medical services (EMS) workers, who are frequently the first professionals to evaluate patients, often do not have advanced notice of patient diagnosis, and have limited time in their national curricula devoted to highly infectious disease (HID) identification and containment. All of these can place them at increased risk. To explore the depth of US EMS practitioners' HID training and education, a pilot gap analysis survey was distributed to determine where the aforementioned can be bolstered to increase occupational safety. Methods: Electronic surveys were distributed to EMS organization members. The survey collected respondent willingness to encounter HID scenarios; current policies and procedures; and levels of knowledge, training, and available resources to address HIDs. Results: A total of 2,165 surveys were initiated and collected. Eighty percent of frontline personnel were aware that their agency had an HID standard operating guideline. Almost 85% of respondents correctly marked routes of exposure for select HIDs. More than half of respondents indicated no maximum shift times in personal protective equipment. Discussion: This research suggests EMS practitioners could benefit from enhanced industry-specific education, training, and planning on HID mitigation and management. Conclusion: Strengthening EMS preparedness in response to suspected or confirmed HID cases may not only improve patient outcomes, but also worker and community safety.",

National recommendations for EMS personnel licensure levels are determined by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA); however, only 1.3% of the national EMS education standards and curricula competencies are allocated to addressing the vastly complex issue of infectious diseases. 19, 20 States utilize the NHTSA EMS model, but ultimately dictate the scope of practice for their state EMS regulatory system. Hence, state licensure models and funding levels differ, which could contribute to the national variability in EMS preparedness to respond to infectious disease incidents.",

            "text": "Because EMS practitioners are often the first health professionals to evaluate patients-frequently without advanced notice of diagnosis-their ability to quickly and accurately recognize symptoms of an HID can help prepare downstream resources for an appropriate response. Although emergency response systems emphasize the importance of EMS practitioners in mounting swift and effective patient care, EMS practitioners are often overlooked when providing HID-specific education and training. In agencies composed of full-time and volunteer practitioners, the dilution of resources may be exacerbated. 19 The lack of time and comprehensive training needed to conduct an extensive patient history could result in an inaccurate diagnosis where early symptoms of an emerging or re-emerging HID could be mistaken for a routine influenzalike illness. Furthermore, the operational separation between EMS agencies and hospitals may prevent EMS practitioners from accessing the more comprehensive training resources often provided to hospital personnel, although HID education and training is necessary to both increase the safety of EMS responders and improve patient outcomes. 21 Additionally, although EMS practitioners receive mandatory Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) training on bloodborne pathogens, the training tends to focus more on protecting individuals than on the logistics and importance of protocols for infection control and decontamination, which is integral in HID containment. 2, 5, 7 These gaps in infection control training can potentially lead to an overall decreased comfort in responding to patients with HID and a consequent decrease in the ability of an emergency response framework to effectively contain an HID exposure. [22] [23] [24] To explore the extent of HID training and knowledge amongst EMS practitioners, a gap analysis survey pertaining to HID preparedness and response among EMS practitioners in the United States was administered. Results were analyzed to determine current levels of HID training, education, current protocols and procedures in place at the respondent's agency, and potential differences in levels of certification or position responsibilities correlated to differences in HID knowledge to determine areas of HID training and education that can be bolstered in this industry to increase occupational safety and health in EMS practitioners.",

Despite more than 70% of both Lead-level and Frontline-level respondents indicating that their agency had provided training on patient and practitioner safety related to HIDs like EVD and severe acute respiratory syndrome, discrepancies in Lead-level and Frontlinelevel perceptions on willingness and comfort with responding to potential HID calls (Tables 1 and 2) and deficiencies in knowledge of the routes of exposure to several key HIDs were found. Moreover, open-ended feedback revealed concerns over the minimal amount of HID training practitioners currently receive from their agency, a lack of confidence in ability and resources to address a HID scenario, and a desire for more enhanced preparedness. Respondents indicated that they most often used government Web sites to obtain HID information; however, that was still <70% from both groups. In a public health emergency, EMS agencies that are strained and unprepared could lead to chaos and flawed judgment calls, like the EVD case in Dallas, TX, in 2014. 29 Hence, EMS agencies-as a trusted and regular contact-are the entities best positioned to distribute up-to-date factual education, evidencebased best practices, training, and guidelines to enhance practitioner health and safety when encountering highly infectious scenarios. This could be achieved by adding specific competencies on HIDs within continuing education requirements for state licensure and/ or expanding the scope of HIDs in the national guidelines outlined by NHTSA.",

Moreover, level of certification seemed to influence levels of willingness and comfort to report to these potential HID scenarios. Paramedics reported being the most willing and comfortable with responding to HID situations out of all certification levels. This could be attributed to the longer duration and depth of training paramedics receive and the lower turnover rates due to fewer routine transport calls and higher pay in the industry for paramedics compared with EMTs and emergency medical responders. 19, 30 Respondents at the Frontline level had less awareness of the level at which infectious disease reporting was mandated (eg, agency or county), whether their agency has a communicable disease emergency response plan, and standard operating guidelines or procedures in response to an HID. Although this might seem out of the necessary scope of knowledge for an EMS practitioner, enhancing frontline knowledge of procedures and infrastructure their agency has in place in event of an HID can lead to increased preparedness and a safer, more efficient response. 31 Additionally, although more than half of respondents indicated that there were mechanisms in place for quality improvement and to enhance the safety of practitioners, the regular use, capture, and overall utility of quality improvement tools like the EMS Voluntary Event Notification Tool is unknown. Hence, inclusion into existing national injury or occupational risk data surveillance systems like the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health EMS Workers Injury and Illness Data Set 32,33 might be a method to capture safety data for analyses to guide improvements and changes.",

Although the majority of practitioners were able to correctly identify routes of exposure for select HIDs, which still leaves more than 15% of respondents incorrectly marking the modes of transmission for Category A agents like EVD, Lassa fever, and Anthrax. This highlights the potential for primary national organizations to increase and/or enhance HID information and education not only through their Web sites, but also via e-newsletters, regular communications to their membership, national conferences, Webinars, and continuing education courses. In addition to a wider dissemination, regular HID information and training resources posted to EMS national organization Web sites could foster uniformity in the resources being distributed across EMS agencies nationwide, and may lead to a corresponding improvement in EMS practitioner HID knowledge.",

JIT training was reported as commonly not being conducted before responding to a potential HID situation. This may be due to most scenarios where EMS have no prenotification of an HID scenario; otherwise with advanced notification the appropriate PPE ensembles should reflect the threat level based on OSHA standards, and it would behoove EMS agencies to conduct JIT training. Studies in both simulated and actual emergency or pandemic scenarios have demonstrated the efficacy of JIT training to enhance responder preparedness. [34] [35] [36] Furthermore, among survey respondents, employee health monitoring postencounter with a potentially infectious patient was lacking. It would benefit EMS agencies to conduct regular employee health monitoring in scenarios with potential exposure to HIDs to protect both the responders and communities in which they serve.",

With respect to PPE protocols and maintenance of PPE supply, the majority of respondents-and more so at the Lead level (>60%)-reported having no maximum amount of time in PPE before being required to change out of the PPE. This underscores the lack of consistency and need for depth of broader educational requirements for PPE. It should be noted that responders who transported the EVD patient within Dallas were not wearing appropriate PPE and the ambulance was not decontaminated immediately after transport for the level required for EVD, resulting in potential EVD exposure to transport personnel, health care workers, and the community and leading to significant negative press. 37 Furthermore, extended periods of time in PPE can lead to physiological and psychological stress, as well as tears and degradation of the PPE, placing workers at increased risk for exposure. Furthermore, frequently responding to events outside of the confines of a hospital exposes EMS practitioners' PPE to variability in the environment (ie, weather and concrete surfaces) that can significantly influence PPE degradation more than the relative smooth finishes and predictable environment within a health care facility. 1 Most did report having protocols or procedures in place for selecting differing PPE ensembles, ensuring adequate supply in the event of increased demand, and monitoring stockpiled PPE for expiration dates and storage.",

This could be due to a lack of awareness among Frontline responders of the administrative/nonpractitioner aspects of their agency and/or a lack of communication from Lead-level to Frontline-level responders. An unexplored yet potentially important contribution to decreased HID knowledge among EMS practitioners may be the differences in training and education between full-time, part-time, and volunteer staff. It is possible that updates on best practices or training on HID transmissibility are not being fully disseminated from full-time staff to those who are part-time workers or volunteers. Although some emergency responders are not paid personnel (volunteers), they must still undergo some baseline level of training, so HID mitigation and management could be a module or component of that training, or at least those courses offered to volunteers to ensure that all individuals in the agency receive consistent and thorough information. Open-ended responses from survey participants indicated a want for more HID education and training, but ultimately it will be up to EMS agencies on the extent of mandating the aforementioned.",

Changes to government and primary national organization websites that more effectively educate EMS practitioners on HID transmissibility and containment, as has been provided to health care workers for years (ie, CDC and World Health Organization Web sites). 2. Organizational changes that foster increased communication of HID training, knowledge, and available resources between administrators and leads with frontline responders, and between practitioners with differing certification levels. This model was utilized at Omaha Fire and Rescue, and led to the safe and successful transport of 3 EVD patients in the United States in a large metropolitan area. 5,16 3. Adhering to and expanding upon existing OSHA and CDC training guidelines and recommendations through increased volume of HID-specific training, including proper PPE use and decontamination techniques. 4. Implementing and/or increasing the volume of regular HID trainings that focus on the epidemiology of re-emerging and emerging HIDs. 5. Utilizing existing national resources, like training programs, that specifically provide free HID training to specific worker populations. 38 Lastly, EMS agencies may benefit from the designation of specifically trained groups of EMS practitioners to respond to confirmed HID incidents. EMS agencies may perceive responding to HID is a low-frequency event, and therefore EMS practitioners may lack the familiarity with certain HIDs and feel a certain level of discomfort when responding to HIDs as a result. Instituting specialized infectious disease transport teams within agencies to respond to and transport a known HID patient may alleviate many concerns and obstacles that arise when comparing a HID scenario to a day-today call. However, this assumes the ability to identify HID during the screening process prior to EMS dispatch and transport. A specialized infectious disease transport team for HID, like hazardous materials and items specialization, could receive comprehensive education, training, and equipment that exceeds what EMS practitioners typically receive, and could bring a greater level of comfort to all EMS personnel in the agency.",

Additionally, although the survey was distributed by EMS and EMT agencies, it was developed and had the logo of an external source, which typically does not elicit as robust of an overall survey response rate (ie, nonparticipation). Although our response rate was >2,000, because it was sent to more than 100,000 individuals we did not believe it was appropriate to use more statistically rigorous techniques (ie, inferential statistics) for a small sample of the study population in this study. Additionally, although more than 100,000 individuals were sent the survey links it does not indicate that all e-mail addresses were functional or that individuals opened the e-mail message. If this study is replicated, to achieve a better overall response rate, it might be improved by a prominent national EMS agencies developing and administering the survey, rather than an external entity asking for the agencies to distribute the survey links. Moreover, anecdotally the national ratio of EMTs to paramedics is 1:4, whereas more than two-thirds of our Leadlevel and Frontline-level respondents were self-reported as paramedics. Consequently, this discrepancy may not only be indicative of a broader pattern of reduced participation in EMS agency by EMTs as compared to paramedics, but may also not be representative of the entire US EMS practitioner population. Lastly, with the survey not forcing participants to answer any question to proceed, this led to varying response rates from question to question.",
