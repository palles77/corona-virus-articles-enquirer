            "text": "The nonstructural polyproteins of Sindbis virus are processed by a virus-encoded proteinase which is located in the C-terminal domain of nsP2. Here we have performed a mutagenic analysis to identify the active site residues of this proteinase. Substitution of other amino acids for either Cys-481 or His-558 completely abolished proteolytic processing of Sindbis virus polyproteins in vitro. Substitutions within this domain for a second cysteine conserved among alphaviruses, for four other conserved histidines, or for a conserved serine did not affect the activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that nsP2 is a papain-like proteinase whose catalytic dyad is composed of Cys-481 and His-558. Since an asparagine residue has been implicated in the active site of papain, we changed the four conserved asparagine residues in the C-terminal half of nsP2 and found that all could be substituted without total loss of activity. Among papain-like proteinases, the residue following the catalytic histidine is alanine or glycine in the plant and animal enzymes, and the presence of Trp-559 in alphaviruses is unusual. A mutant enzyme containing Ala-559 was completely inactive, implying that Trp-559 is essential for a functional proteinase. All of these mutations were introduced into a full-length clone of Sindbis virus from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro, and the effects of these changes on viability were tested. In all cases it was found that mutations which abolished proteolytic activity were lethal, whether or not these mutations were in the catalytic residues, indicating that proteolysis of the nonstructural polyprotein is essential for Sindbis replication. 0 1992 Academic press, hc.",

Viral proteinases have been described which resemble cellular proteinases belonging to three distinct families: the aspartate proteases that resemble pepsin, the serine/cysteine proteinases that resemble ttypsin or chymotrypsin, and the thiol proteases that resemble papain. The best characterized viral proteases are the aspartate proteases encoded by retroviruses. The residues making up the catalytic triad (Asp, Thr, Gly) of the HIV proteinase have been confirmed by site-specific mutagenesis (Loeb et a/., 1989) , and the structure of the proteinase has been determined to high resolution by X-ray crystallography (Navia et al,, 1989) . The three-dimensional folding of the viral proteinase resembles pepsin, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.",

Originally these domains were predicted to have proteolytic activity based on the presence of certain conserved amino acid residues and on the basis of protein-modeling studies (Bazan and Fletterick, 1989; Boege et a/., 1981; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Hahn eta/., 1985) . The catalytic triad of trypsin is composed of a serine, a histidine, and an aspartic acid; in the flavivirus NS3 proteinase (Chambers et a/., 1990) , the pestivirus p80 proteinase (Wiskerchen eta/., 1991) , and the alphavirus capsid proteinase , such a triad has been confirmed by mutagenesis. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the Sindbis alphavirus capsid protein has been determined to 3 A, and the C-terminal 151 amino acids are folded into a structure remarkably similar to that of chymotrypsin, with His-141, Asp-163, and Ser-215 forming the catalytic site (Choi et al., 1991 b) . The similarity in the folding of this capsid protein to that of chymotrypsin suggests that the virus acquired a proteinase from a host at some time in the past, and that all of the viral chymotrypsin-like proteinases will in fact be similar in structure.",

            "text": "Recently, we proposed that the nonstructural proteinase of Sindbis alphavirus was related to papain, thus representing a third family of viral proteinases (Hardy and Strauss, 1989; Strauss and Strauss, 1990) , and Gorbalenya et al. (199 1) proposed that papain-like proteinases were present in several RNA viruses. In papain, a cysteine and a histidine form a catalytic dyad, and there is conflicting evidence as to whether an asparagine residue is also an essential component of the active site (Higaki et al., 1987; Kamphuis et al., 1985) . Other proposed papain-like proteinases in RNA viruses include two domains within ORFl a of coronaviruses identified by protein modeling studies (Baker et al., 1991; Lee et al., 1991) and the HC-Pro protein of potyviruses, in which the catalytic Cys and His residues have been identified by mutagenesis (Oh and Carrington, 1989) . Interestingly, in a number of cases viruses encode proteinases of more than one type. Coronaviruses, for example, encode one or two proteins with sequences characteristic of a papain-like proteinase as well as one with similarity to a 3C-like proteinase within ORFl a (Boursnell eta/., 1987; Lee et al., 1991) . Similarly, in potyviruses there is both a 3Clike proteinase (the 49-kDa protein) as well as a papainlike proteinase (the HC or helper component protein) (Oh and Carrington, 1989 ). Finally, as described above, the alphaviruses possess a chymotrypsin-like structural proteinase and a papain-like nonstructural proteinase.",

To investigate the possible role of an asparagine residue in the catalytic activity of the nsP2 proteinase, we mutagenized all four asparagine residues within the catalytic domain that are conserved among alphaviruses, namely Asn-561, Asn-609, Asn-614, and Asn-693. In each case we changed the asparagine to both aspartic acid and to serine, and the results are summarized in Table 2 . Substitution of either serine or aspartic acid for Asn-56 1 and Asn-6 14 produced enzymes with near wild type activity.

Some experiments showed almost wild type processing (data not shown), while in the translation shown in Fig. 4 Asp-693 and Ser-693 both show markedly reduced processing. Similar variability in processing during in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysates has been noted for constructs containing the NS3 proteinase of flaviviruses (Preugschat et a/., 1991) .

The severely reduced activity of the enzyme containing the Asn-609 + Asp mutation was not due to some additional lesion elsewhere in the protein. As a control a restriction fragment of 375 nucleotides containing this change from the mutant construct was excised, sequenced in its entirety, and reinserted into the Toto background, and the resulting construct was also nearly inactive. Presumably the presence of a charged residue at this position alters the overall conformation of the protein, leading to reduced activity. Multiple independent isolates of this mutation all had similar phenotypes.",

The crystal structure of papain has been determined to 1.65A resolution (Kamphuis et al., 1984) , but structural information is lacking for other enzymes. Because the amino acid similarities around the active site residues or throughout the rest of the proteins are limited and even the spacing between the active cysteine and histidine is quite variable, it remains to be determined what the relationships are between the plant, animal, and viral enzymes. In particular, it is not clear whether the folding of the viral proteins resembles that of the plant or animal proteins; similar folding would be strongly indicative of the descent of animal, viral, and plant proteins from a common ancestral enzyme.",

Furthermore, there is considerable sequence identity among papain-like enzymes around this amino acid. In order to examine whether an asparagine might be required for activity of the Sindbis nsP2 proteinase, all four asparagine residues within the proteinase domain that are conserved among alphaviruses were subjected to mutagenesis. In every case at least one substitution was partially tolerated, and we conclude that no asparagine residue is absolutely essential for proteolysis.

It was suggested that these residues were involved in substrate binding and that a longer side chain at position 23 might block substrate binding by approaching too closely the side chain of Gln-19 (Baker and Drenth, 1987) . In alphaviruses the residue corresponding to position 23 of papain is asparagine, whereas that at position 19 is Ser in Sindbis virus and Gln in other alphaviruses (Fig. 5) . No firm conclusions can be drawn in the absence of crystal structures, because the substrate specificity of alphavirus nsP2 is very different from that of papain or cathepsin. Papain has a strong preference for bulky hydrophobic amino acids, phenylalanine, tyrosine, valine, or leucine in the P2 position (the penultimate amino acid relative to the site of cleavage), while the animal cathepsins require nonpolar side chains at this position. The P2 position of alphavirus cleavage sites is always glycine. When this glycine is changed to valine or to glutamic acid, the site becomes noncleavable . Comparisons of this nature assume that the overall folding of the viral proteinases is similar to that of papain, but confirmation of this will require three-dimensional crystal structures of the viral counterparts.",

            "text": "Finally, there is the question of the viability of the various mutants. It is not surprising that mutations which kill the proteinase are lethal, such as the substitutions at Cys-481, His-558 and Trp-559, or that some substitutions which gave severely reduced processing were lethal or gave minute plaques. It was more surprising to discover that at position 614 the change from Asn to Asp-614 gave enhanced cleavage and apparently normal cleavage products but was lethal for viral replication, while the change to Ser-6 14 gave normal processing and normal virus production. Note that in Fig. 4 that the most obvious difference in the translation/processing pattern of Asp-61 4 was the lack of any residual P123. With the wild type, the amount of residual P123 varied with the batch of reticulocyte lysate, and there was a significant amount in the experiment shown in Fig. 4 . The lethality of this particular substitution may indicate a separate and necessary role for P123 (or for some other processing intermediate) in alphavirus replication. Similarly, it is of interest to compare the results for the two substitutions at Asn-693. Both gave variable and somewhat reduced proteolysis, but in one case (Ser-693) the change was also lethal. This may mean that slight changes in the rate of proteolysis, which may not be detectable in the cell-free translation system used, can still interfere with efficient virus replication. It is also possible that some of these changes affect the overall conformation of nsP2 and polyproteins containing nsP2. Such an altered conformation could affect the helicase activity or impair some as yet unknown function of nsP2 other than proteolysis. The fact that many changes are poorly tolerated illustrates the fact that the alphaviruses, as isolated in nature, appear to be optimized for replication.",
