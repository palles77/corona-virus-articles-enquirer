However, the mechanism underlying has not been systematically evaluated, which limited their application in disease treatment. Nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2212related factor 2 (Nrf2), a central transcription factor in oxidative stress response related to numerous diseases, is activated after dissociating from the cytoskeleton\u2212anchored Kelch\u2212like ECH\u2212associated protein 1 (Keap1). The Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction has become an important drug target. This study was designed to clarify whether antioxidantive phytochemicals inhibit the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction and activate the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway efficiently. Molecular docking and 3D\u2212QSAR were applied to evaluate the interaction effects between 178 antioxidant phytochemicals and the Nrf2 binding site in Keap1.",

Meanwhile, these compounds could bind with key amino acids in the structure of the Keap1\u2212Nrf2 interface.

The nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2212related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway is the major pathway that responds to reactive species and redox potentials, and Nrf2 activation is a key defense mechanism against oxidative stress (H et al., 2012) . However, under physiological conditions, repressor Kelch\u2212like ECH\u2212associated protein 1 (Keap1) holds Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and promotes its ubiquitination (Mcmahon et al., 2003) . By contrast, under pathological conditions, Nrf2 is released from Keap1, translocates to the nucleus, and triggers the transcriptional activation of ARE\u2212dependent genes and antioxidative enzymes (Dhakshinamoorthy and Jaiswal, 2001) . Thus, targeting the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway is a logical strategy to discover therapeutic agents for diseases and conditions induced by oxidative stress. The direct inhibition of the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction is an alternative for the discovery of small\u2212molecule Nrf2 activators (Magesh et al., 2012) . Compounds that interact with Keap1 and occupy the Nrf2 binding site in the protein can cause the dissociation of Keap1 from Nrf2 and finally induce the transcriptional activation of Nrf2 (Pang et al., 2016) .",

Many studies have shown that phytochemicals in edible flowers, vegetables, and fruits prevent or mitigate chronic diseases in humans (Kumar et al., 2012; Steinmetz and Potter, 1996) . Studies in the last few decades have demonstrated the benefits of phytochemicals counteracting oxidative stress. Phenolic compounds as primary antioxidants can scavenge free radicals, thereby delaying or inhibiting the initiation step and interrupting the propagation step of lipid oxidation (Kiokias et al., 2008) . Vitamin E functions as a peroxyl radical\u2212scavenging antioxidant and as an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation in vitro and in vivo (Niki, 2014) . Carotenoids can act as chemical quenchers undergoing irreversible oxygenation. Epidemiological studies and clinical trials showed that adequate carotenoid supplementation may significantly reduce the risk of several disorders mediated by reactive oxygen species (Fiedor and Burda, 2014) . Natural alkaloids are effective under oxidative stress in DPPH, FRAP, and TEAC assays (Rehman and Khan, 2017) . Some of these natural compounds exhibit antioxidant effects through activating the Nrf2 pathway; however, details on this finding are few.",

(3) Compounds with higher Total_Score (Total_Score > 6) in binding affinity with Keap1 showed significantly positive effects on the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the H 2 O 2 \u2212induced oxidative\u2212injured cell model. Molecular docking is a very powerful technique for screening large numbers of new compounds as active drug candidates, and this technique has been successfully used in the discovery of antimicrobial (Shen et al., 2010) , Alzheimer's disease related cyclophilin D inhibitors (Valasani et al., 2014) , human coronavirus nucleocapsid protein inhibitors (Chang et al., 2016) . Previous studies paid great attention to antioxidants and Nrf2 activators; however, few of these studies systematically screened Nrf2 activators from known antioxidants. Wu et al. (2014) utilized AREc32 cells that contain a luciferase gene under the control of antioxidant response element promoters to screen Nrf2 activators. In this study, 178 phytochemicals were selected from the literature and directly explored whether they can activate Nrf2 by inhibiting the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction using the molecular docking method. With the help of the software, 24 candidates were obtained, and the results showed that the number of glycosides and oxygen positively correlated with the binding affinity of compounds with Keap1. The procedure above was easy to operate and time saving.",

            "text": "Further study showed that the C3S, L5G, RUT, \u03b1T, and ECH from the 24 candidates can significantly increase the Nrf2 level in the nucleus. Several studies have reported about the antioxidant effects of \u03b1T (Niki, 2014) and ECH (And and Kitts, 2000) . Masoudi et al. (2014) reported that \u03b1T activates the transcription factor Nrf2 in neuronal cells and that ECH is a representative antioxidant compound in Herba Cistanches (Tu et al., 1997) . C3S (Cheng et al., 2009 ) was subjected to DPPH scavenging activities, AOP, and reducing power assessments; a dose\u2212dependent antioxidant activity was observed. L5G (Jung et al., 2017) in Korean milk thistle strongly protects t\u2212BHP\u2212treated HepG2 cells from oxidative damage, and these protective effects might be attributed to Nrf2 activation. RUT (Tian et al., 2015) significantly attenuates oxidative stress and upregulates Nrf2 expression in a rat model. Previous studies are consistent with our results. The 24 candidates bind with the special amino acids on Keap1, such as Ser363, Ser508, Ser555 and Ser602, which have been reported to be the key amino acids in the structure of the Keap1\u2212Nrf2 interface (Lo et al., 2014) . The results indicated that the compounds with high binding affinity with Keap1 could directly inhibit Keap1\u2212Nrf2 protein\u2212protein interaction as Nrf2 activators.",
