The binding strength of each of the X(j) reagents to each other is measured, for example by an ELISA assay, giving an N \u00c2 N matrix K. The matrix K is used to define another set of N reagents called Y(j), with j \u00bc 1 to N, each of which is a linear combination of the X(j) reagents and each of which is tailored to be complementary to one of the X(j) reagents. Each of the N pairs of reagents X(j) and Y(j) defines an axis in an N-dimensional shape space. The definition of these axes facilitates proteomic analysis of diverse biological samples, for example, mixtures of proteins such as serum samples or T cell extracts. A method for defining and measuring similarity between pairs of biological samples and between sets of biological samples in the context of the set of N reagent pairs is described. This leads to methods for using the N reagent pairs in the diagnosis of diseases and in the formulation of preventive and therapeutic vaccines. The relationship of this work to previous research on shape space is discussed. r",

Even with the spectacular advances that are currently being made in proteomics, such a description is not a realistic goal, and even if it were, achieving it may not be particularly useful. Each individual has his or her own set of V regions, due to different V region genes, different MHC (major histocompatability complex) genes that affect the expressed repertoire of T cells, and different histories of exposure to a wide range of antigens. Furthermore, different somatic mutations in each individual contribute significantly to the generation of the V region repertoire.",

In the earlier work, experimentally measurable similarity coefficients S[A,B|C] specify the extent to which a pair of substances, A and B, are similar in the context of a diverse reagent, C. The definition of S[A,B|C] is the fraction of C that binds both A and B divided by the sum of (i) the fraction that bind A but not B, (ii) the fraction that binds B but not A and (iii) the fraction that binds both A and B. The value of S[A,B|C] is then necessarily a number between zero and one. This definition was applied (conceptually) also to similarities between complex mixtures of substances, such as the antibodies of two serum samples, A and B. A ''distance coefficient '' D[A,B|C] between two sera, A and B, in the context of C, was defined as one minus the similarity coefficient in the same context. Methods for the experimental measurement of these coefficients and their possible use in the diagnosis and prognosis of disease conditions were described.",
