The etiological agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as a novel pathogen with high infectiousness to general population and relatively high mortality rate. According to the lasted data released by the WHO on 17 th March 2020, 184,976 confirmed cases of were reported in 159 countries and regions globally, causing 7,529 deaths. 1 Currently, the epidemic center has been shifted to Europe and WHO advocated that Europe should learn the lessons from China on infection control. Several COVID-19 studies from the Chinese researchers [2] [3] [4] [5] have provided first-hand knowledge and valuable treatment experiences on the disease for other countries, but most of the studies were targeted at adult patients. Although pediatric cases of COVID-19 were constantly reported, the majority of published studies were case reports or studies with sample size of less than 50 pediatric cases. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] To determine the spectrum of disease in children, we collected and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data of 74 pediatric COVID-19 cases in two locations of northern and southern China. We hope our study would further the available knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and provide an insight to treatment strategies and prophylactic control of the disease.",

Most pediatric patients had relatively mild disease with good prognosis, which could also be observed in children infected with SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses. Compared with pediatric patients, mortality rate of seasonal flu in adults is nearly 10 times higher.24 Several studies have shown that children with SARS only presented with fever, cough and nasal congestion, and seldom developed into the third phase of SARS (characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome). Accordingly, it is difficult to distinguish children with SARS from infection with other common respiratory viruses.25-27 Non-specific clinical, Radiologic and laboratory characteristics of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection making them hard to be recognized, raising the possibility of misdetection of asymptomatic carriers. A comprehensive evaluation of epidemiological exposure and nucleic acid testing results would be warranted to guide clinical decision making. More attention should be drawn to children with COVID-19 who also have co-infection with other common respiratory pathogens. Among the 74 pediatric patients included in this study, 19 (51.35%) of the 34 children who had testing results for common respiratory pathogens had co-infection; 8 (42.11%) children had two or more pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 detected. This finding was consistent with our previous observation and also in line with studies of others. 28, 29 It can be seen that co-infection is common in children with COVID-19, indicating SARS-CoV-2 screening is necessary to identify COVID-19 cases, especially during the peak season for colds, influenza and other respiratory ailments.

SARS-CoV-2 may present in gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system, which appears to be more common among pediatric patients. However, there is limited data on comparison with adult patients. Detection of viral RNA in feces of convalescent patients does not necessarily mean that the virus are replication-competent nor infectious enough to be transmitted. There is still a possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
