KT029139.1 for wild type and KT868873.1 for I529T mutant) were cultured in a 24-well plate containing a monolayer of Vero E6 cells or 293T cells stably expressing CD26 (1). After 1 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, viral supernatant was removed and cells were overlaid with 1 mL of 1% methylcellulose in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium, including 10% fetal bovine serum. Plates were incubated for 3 d at 37\u00b0C, and then cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 100% methanol. The MERS-CoV plaques were detected using rabbit anti-MERS-CoV N protein antibody (Sino Biologic Inc.) and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen; https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/invitrogen.html). Viral plaques were visualized by incubation with 0.05% 3\uf0a23-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Cellular layers were counterstained with trypan blue dye.",

Subsequently, the infected 293T-CD26 cells were lysed 48 h after infection, and the efficiency of viral entry was measured by comparing luciferase activity. The relative luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega; https://www.promega.com) and Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader (Tecan; https://lifesciences.tecan.com). Neutralization titers of collected serum samples against MERS-CoV were also determined by a plaque reduction neutralization titer assay. Each serum sample collected from convalescent-phase patient was serially diluted and incubated with wild-type MERS-CoV or I529T mutant MERS-CoV (0.004 multiplicity of infection) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C.
