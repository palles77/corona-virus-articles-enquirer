However, most manuscripts require a second round of revisions. In the current setting, the time between the initial submission and final acceptance is much lower than usually reported. International guidelines (3) and even some clinical trials using a fast-track process (4) were published in this emergency setting. We may face several issues here. First of all, as reviewers, we could be influenced by the current drama when evaluating a manuscript.",

Whether these factors would influence the quality of research published in the next few months remain to be seen. On a different note, it appears thatevery journal, every Editor, and every reviewer could potentially accelerate the entire peer review process ; something that would be useful in the long-term. This would speed up the medical research worldwide (if necessary). Let's hope that all published papers on COVID-19 have the same quality than those published before the beginning of this pandemic.
