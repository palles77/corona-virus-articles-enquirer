Our study has specifically identified that diabetes, hypertension, renal disease, malignancy, miscellaneous conditions, and male sex were the main risk factors for mortality. Another small study also demonstrated that diabetes was significantly associated with mortality (OR = 15.7; 95%CI 2.5-100.7) (Shalhoub et al., 2015) . In contrast, among South Korean patients, underlying respiratory disease and older age were the key risk factors for mortality (Korea CDC, 2015) . In our study, presence of a respiratory disease was not a significant risk factor and we did not explore the association of older age with mortality, because essentially all patients aged \u2265 65 years in our cohort had a pre-existing disease, but age itself could be an independent risk factor, as other studies from Saudi Arabia and South Korea demonstrated that age > 60 years (in some studies \u2265 65 years) was significantly associated with mortality (Feikin et al., 2015; Majumder et al., 2015; Saad et al., 2014) . Additionally, Majumder et al. (2015) demonstrated that for every one year of increase in age, the odds of fatality increased by 12% (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.2). The risk factors might vary geographically; additionally, the relatively small sample sizes in other studies could have missed other significant risk factors.",
