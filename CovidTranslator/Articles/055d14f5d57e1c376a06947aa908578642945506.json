Dengue disease may present as a nonspecific febrile illness or as a more severe infection marked by hemorrhage or circulatory failure (3, 4) . DENV is a flavivirus that exists as 4 distinct serotypes (DENV-1-DENV-4) and is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (5) . At the amino acid level, the 4 DENV serotypes share limited similarity among serotypes (about 60%-75%) but about 97% similarity within a given serotype (6) . Epidemiological studies have reported differences between serotypes with regard to disease severity. Notably, DENV-2 secondary infections have been associated with more severe disease, while DENV-4 infections have been correlated with more mild disease (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) .",

Immature DCs in the periphery efficiently capture antigens via phagocytosis and macropinocytosis. Upon interacting with infectious agents, immature DCs subsequently mature, a process that includes DC surface remodeling, increased antigen presentation, and the production of numerous cytokines (22) . Mature DCs upregulate chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR7) that aid in their migration to lymph nodes as well as costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD80, CD86, CD40) that are required for activating antigen-specific T cells in the lymph node and inducing T cell proliferation and effector functions (23, 24) . In this way, DCs are key players in linking innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, the ability of viruses to modulate innate immunity in these cells will have a significant affect on viral replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis.",

Of the 4 DENV serotypes, epidemiological data suggest that DENV-2 secondary infections are associated with more severe disease than DENV-4 infections. Mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) was used to dissect immune changes induced by DENV-2 and DENV-4 in human DCs, the initial targets of primary infections that likely affect infection outcomes. Strikingly, DENV-4 replication peaked earlier and promoted stronger innate immune responses, with increased expression of DC activation and migration markers and increased cytokine production, compared with DENV-2. In addition, infected DCs produced higher levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with bystander DCs, which mainly produced IFN-induced cytokines. These high-dimensional analyses during DENV-2 and DENV-4 infections revealed distinct viral signatures marked by different replication strategies and antiviral innate immune induction in DCs, which may result in different viral fitness, transmission, and pathogenesis. model for studying primary DENV infections and investigating the effects of DENV infection on DC activation and function (16, 17, 25) .",

However, there are conflicting reports as to whether the Th1 cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as the regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 promote pathogenesis or confer protection during DENV infection (28) (29) (30) . Additionally, our group and others have demonstrated that DENV-2 (strain 16681) inhibits both type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) production and signaling and impairs CD4 + T cell polarization (16, 17, 25, (31) (32) (33) , which may prevent protective adaptive immune responses.",

Unlike flow cytometry, which requires compensation for overlapping fluorescence spectra, CyTOF uses antibodies labeled with elemental isotopes and is largely unencumbered by interference from spectral overlap between channels (34) . Currently, CyTOF allows for single-cell analysis for up to 45 parameters simultaneously (35) . With this powerful technology, which has not yet been used to characterize infection with DENV or other hemorrhagic fever viruses, we have simultaneously investigated DENV infection, DC activation, intracellular cytokine production, and apoptosis as well as the differences between bystander and infected cells in the same DC culture. Importantly, investigating viral replication and the subsequent host innate immune responses will provide insight into fitness strategies used by vector-borne viruses like DENV to remain in circulation, while inducing varying degrees of disease severity in humans. Herein, we provide a comprehensive functional analysis comparing DC infections with DENV-2 and its most phylogenetically distant serotype, DENV-4, which have been associated with differences in disease severity. We show that DENV-2 and DENV-4 display different replication strategies and induce different antiviral innate immune responses in human DCs, which may be related to differences in viral fitness, transmission, and pathogenesis.",

Using CyTOF analysis to measure intracellular DENV structural and nonstructural proteins and titration of extracellular infectious DENV particles, we found that DENV-2 peak infection occurred at 48 hours after infection (hpi), whereas DENV-4 infection peaked at 24 hpi and was significantly diminished by 72 hpi (Figure 1 , A-D). Notably, DENV-4 infection resulted in a greater percentage of infected DCs compared with DENV-2 infection (Figure 1, A and B) . Interestingly, despite significant differences in the percentages of infected cells ( Figure 1B ) and different infection kinetics ( Figure 1D ), the peak titers of infectious particles released extracellularly were similar between DENV-2 and DENV-4 ( Figure 1D ). Additionally, even though DENV-2 infected a smaller percentage of cells compared with DENV-4, those DCs infected with DENV-2 showed significantly higher levels of DENV nonstructural 3 (NS3) protein ( Figure 1C ) at 48 and 72 hpi compared with the DCs infected with DENV-4. Together, these data suggest that DENV-2 infects fewer DCs later during infection, with each infected cell producing many infectious particles, whereas DENV-4 infects more DCs earlier during infection, with each infected cell producing fewer infectious particles.",

This indicates that the cells upregulating cytokines are distinct from those upregulating high levels of DC maturation markers during DENV infection. This was consistent with the hierarchical clustering analysis of autogated CyTOF data (Figure 2 ), in which cytokines clustered more closely to DENV antigens and other cytokines and farther from DC phenotypic and functional markers. Additionally in viSNE analysis, the cells expressing high levels of cleaved caspase-3, a marker for apoptosis, were largely localized to a distinct cluster, representing another distinct group of cells responding to DENV infection ( Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 7 ). Altogether, these data indicated that the responses to DENV infection in these DC cell cultures were heterogeneous and that there were distinct cellular phenotypes associated with cells expressing viral antigens. Heat maps comparing cellular marker positivity by denoting cells as either positive or negative for each marker during mock, dengue virus 2 (DENV-2), and DENV-4 infections. For all plots, markers are ordered vertically by hierarchical clustering of the rows, which places markers with similar expression profiles closer together. Statistical significance was determined using a 2-sided Fisher's exact test at a threshold of \u03b1 = 10 -5 with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Cellular markers not representing a significant difference between infection conditions at this threshold are labeled with \"NS\"; all others are significant. Calculations were made using the event counts from mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) data, as determined by autogating of cells positive for each marker based on the 99th percentile threshold, which was set for mock treatment at 8 hours after infection (hpi). The comparative effects on each marker were calculated as the log 10 of the relative risk for positive marker frequency between the indicated infection conditions. The histograms within the heat map color scales show the total number of cells matching that intensity range, revealing the overall distribution of the values. One representative DC donor of seven is shown. ",

This allowed us to interrogate the specific contribution of bystander versus DENV-infected cells by using markers indicative of DENV infection (i.e., DENV E and NS3 proteins). Notably, the various patterns observed between infected and bystander cells were similar during both DENV-2 and DENV-4 infections. Generally, DC activation markers CD80, CD86, CD40, and CCR7 were similarly upregulated by DENV-infected and bystander cells following both DENV-2 and DENV-4 infection of DC cultures ( Figure 4 ). On the other hand, both DENV-2-infected and DENV-4-infected DCs showed increased production of TNF-\u03b1 + and IL-1\u03b2 + cells compared with their respective bystander cells ( Figure 5 , A and B). Remarkably, this was notable even for DENV-2, despite the low number of DENV-2-infected cells. IL-8 production was generally similar between DENV-infected and bystander cells, except at an early time point when DENV-4-infected cells demonstrated a greater percentage of IL-8 + cells compared with their bystander cells ( Figure 5C ). Interestingly, and consistent with its role as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), IP-10 was produced primarily by bystander cells compared with DENV-4-infected cells at 24 and 48 hpi, but this effect was not as pronounced in DENV-2-infected cultures ( Figure 5D ). Thus, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2), chemokines (IL-8), and ISGs (IP-10) demonstrated distinct patterns of production in DENV-infected versus bystander DCs. Additionally, both DENV-2-and DENV-4-infected DCs demonstrated higher percentages of cleaved caspase-3 + cells compared with their respective bystander cells at later time points, suggesting greater levels of apoptosis in DENV-infected cells ( Figure 5E ). It is notable that the timing of these observations is consistent with the kinetics of infection for these two viruses.",

The observed differences in cytokine and chemokine production by DENV-2 and DENV-4 could be theoretically due to the different proportion of infected cells in the culture between the two viruses. To address this possibility, we infected DCs with DENV-2 and DENV-4 at different MOIs to yield a similar percentage of infected cells at their respective peak titers (Supplemental Figure 9 ). We found that cytokine and chemokine secretion for DENV-2 infection was generally MOI dependent, with greater cytokine and chemokine secretion at the higher MOI (Supplemental Figure 9) . Nevertheless, even when DCs were infected with DENV-2 at a high MOI of 25, cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, RANTES, IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and MIG) were still secreted at higher levels during infection with DENV-4 (MOI of 0.5) at most time points (Supplemental Figure 9 ). Together, these data suggest that the level of cytokine and chemokine secretion depended less on viral load (MOI) and more on inherent strain differences between the two virus strains.",

            "text": "Interestingly, these DENV-2 and DENV-4 strains show markedly different replication kinetics in human DCs but replicate similarly in mosquito cells (Figure 1 ). This DENV-4 strain is also more capable of activating human DCs, upregulating DC migration markers, and inducing cytokine production compared with this DENV-2 strain. Therefore, we postulate that DENV-4 may be better adapted for prolonged virus replication in mosquitoes compared with human cells, whereas DENV-2 may be well adapted for prolonged replication in both hosts. The early burst in DENV-4 replication may be sufficient to produce the necessary level of viremia in the human host to allow for early transmission back to the mosquito before the human immune response effectively clears the infection, thereby preventing continuous inflammatory responses caused by sustained viral replication. This viral fitness strategy could enable DENV-4 to continue circulating without causing severe disease in most infected humans. In contrast, the DENV-2 strain infects relatively few cells and does not induce such a robust innate immune response in human DCs. In this way, DENV-2 may be more efficient than DENV-4 at evading human immune responses, causing a more prolonged viremia in the human host and ensuring later transmission back to the mosquito. Additionally, the limited induction of innate immunity during DENV-2 infection may lead to inefficient adaptive immune responses (33) and greater epidemic potential for DENV-2. The data presented in this work thereby support the epidemiological studies showing that DENV-4 infections generally result in milder disease in humans compared with DENV-2 (7-12). Such pronounced differences in immune responses induced by these DENV serotypes illustrate the importance of continued investigation into the unique qualities of each DENV serotype to better characterize DENV-induced immune responses and pathogenesis. Furthermore, since the representative DENV strains used in this study were isolated many years ago and have therefore undergone numerous passages in the laboratory, future studies will be important for testing multiple strains of these DENV serotypes, including contemporary strains and low-passage human isolates, to further test these hypotheses and to minimize the effects of possible viral adaptations that can occur during passage in tissue culture. Additionally, future studies will investigate blood samples from dengue-infected patients to correlate virus replication and immune profiles with DENV serotype and disease severity.",

First, it has been shown that DENV-4 NS5 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, whereas DENV-2 NS5 is predominantly located in the nuclei of infected cells (41) (42) (43) . Since DENV replication takes place in the cytoplasm (44) , there may be a correlation between the availability of more NS5 polymerase molecules for DENV-4 replication in the cytoplasm and earlier peak replication kinetics. In addition, differences in DENV NS5 nuclear localization may affect splicing of host RNAs, such as those involved in immune responses to virus infections (45) . Additionally, the most 5\u2032 region of the DENV 3\u2032 untranslated region is one of the least conserved regions of the DENV genome among the serotypes (46) . Due to differences in this region, DENV-2 and DENV-4 likely produce different subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs). It has been proposed that sfRNA accumulation is associated with viral epidemiological fitness (46, 47) . In particular, DENV-2 strains with greater sfRNA production relative to viral genomic RNA have been correlated with epidemiological fitness (47) . It has also been shown that sfRNA can antagonize human innate immune pathways, decreasing both IFN and ISG production (48) . Furthermore, it was recently found that different DENV sfRNA species accumulate in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts during host change, with subsequent implications for innate immune responses and viral fitness (49) . It would therefore be very interesting to determine if differences in sfRNA could account for differences between DENV-2 and DENV-4 with regard to innate immune induction and viral fitness during host adaptation between humans and mosquitoes.",

This is consistent with hierarchical clustering analysis of autogated CyTOF data, in which cytokines tend to cluster more closely with other cytokines and to DENV antigens and in distinct branches from the DC phenotypic and functional markers (Figure 2 ). This suggests that the expression of different cytokines may be driven by signaling pathways and transcriptional programs that are more similar to one another and less similar to those regulating DC surface marker expression following DENV infection.",

Existing studies have shown some differential effects of DENV-2 infection on bystander cells versus infected cells in the same culture (50-56). Our unique CyTOF study using 20 markers simultaneously provides more comprehensive data on changes to DC phenotype and function, as well as better temporal resolution, following both DENV-2 and DENV-4 infections. Consistent with prior data (51, 56), we observed that DCs infected with both DENV-2 and DENV-4 strains preferentially produce TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, while bystander DCs preferentially produce IP-10 ( Figure 5 ). Interestingly, our data also show that type I IFN is secreted at higher levels during DENV-4 infection of DCs as compared with DENV-2 infection of DCs ( Figure 6 ). Thus, it is likely that DENV-4-infected cells produce type I IFN, which then induces the production of ISGs, such as IP-10, in bystander cells. These bystander cells should be unable to block IFN signaling, since they do not contain DENV NS5 protein, which degrades STAT2 in infected cells (31) . These data are also in agreement with the literature showing that DENV-2 infections do not induce robust type I IFN responses in human DCs (51, 56) .",

The upregulation in CCR7 observed in our study for both infected and bystander cells after DENV-4 infection suggests that both DENV-4-infected and bystander DCs could migrate to draining lymph nodes during an in vivo infection.

This is consistent with other work showing that sustained DENV infection may lead to greater induction of apoptosis (55) . Cells undergoing apoptosis may release viral progeny, contributing to virus spreading, or may release apoptotic bodies that are later engulfed by other DCs, which may lead to bystander DC maturation. It is also possible that loss of DENV-infected DCs by apoptosis could impair the connection between innate and adaptive immunity and thereby diminish the human immune response to DENV infection. With these data, we have demonstrated that both sample-wide and population-stratified analyses are valuable and yield different insights into the immunological consequences of viral infections. Our data clearly demonstrate that DENV infection induces important phenotypic changes in both infected and bystander cells, both of which likely contribute to the overall immune response to these viral infections. Furthermore, these data illustrate that even small numbers of DENV-infected cells can contribute to these different responses.",

            "text": "This work, in concert with previous data in the literature, suggests the following model: dermal DCs and Langerhans cells are the primary cells infected with DENV following the bite of an infected mosquito (21, (57) (58) (59) . The infected DCs secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in an influx of monocytes into the dermis that can differentiate into DCs and become new targets for DENV replication (59) . Infected DCs undergo activation and maturation, which is characterized by the upregulation of markers, such as CD40, CD80, CD86 and CCR7. Cytokine production (e.g., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) by DENV-infected cells can activate bystander DCs, causing them to mature and upregulate CCR7. Other immune stimuli, such as defective viral particles or DENV-infected DC-derived exosomes containing viral components (60) (61) (62) (63) (64) , could also activate bystander cells. Both infected and bystander DCs are then able to migrate to draining lymph nodes and interact with T cells (57) . Bystander cells could also have been abortively infected or could have captured DENV antigens via phagocytosis of exosomes containing DENV antigens; those antigens would have been missed with the antibody used to measure active replication in our assay. Thus, it is possible that bystander cells may still be able to present DENV antigens to T cells in the lymph nodes. On the other hand, it is also possible that bystander cells may not have acquired DENV antigens, and their migration to the draining lymph nodes may interfere with T cell priming by DENV-infected DCs. The magnitude of type I IFN and IP-10 production by DCs may also contribute to the ability of these DCs to prime T cells in the lymph node toward a Th1 response (16) . In this way, infection of DCs with this DENV-4 strain, which results in greater production of IFN-\u03b1, IP-10, and IL-12, may be more efficient at skewing the adaptive immune response toward a Th1 response compared with infection with this DENV-2 strain.",

Finally, this work may provide a useful framework for investigating emerging viruses, in particular, arboviruses, like chikungunya virus and Zika virus, that have caused recent epidemics. Investigating different replication strategies used by vector-borne viruses and the consequential immune induction by the host may provide insights into different fitness strategies that vector-borne viruses use to remain in circulation.",

Samples collected at the 8, 24, 48, and 72 hpi time points were stored and then combined together and acquired simultaneously as a single barcoded sample to minimize acquisition batch effects. Immediately prior to acquisition, the barcoded samples were washed in diH 2 0 and resuspended at a concentration of 600,000 cells per ml with a 1:20 dilution of EQ 4 element beads. Samples were acquired on a CyTOF2 using a SuperSampler fluidics system (Victorian Airships) at an event rate of <350 events/s. Following data acquisition, data were concatenated and normalized using the CyTOF2 software. The barcoded samples were then deconvoluted using a Matlab-based debarcoding and doublet-filtering application (75), using a stringent Mahalanobis distance cutoff to ensure optimal barcode separation.

Manual and automatic gating have comparative advantages and disadvantages that could be accentuated by the high dimensionality of CyTOF data. Although it is currently the standard method, manual gating may be subject to operator bias in choosing thresholds for marker positivity or negativity (76) , whereas autogating is not subject to such bias, as it specifies a deterministic and perfectly reproducible threshold for each channel. On the other hand, the sensitivity and specificity of autogating may be affected by data quality and certain analytical assumptions, such as the unexpected presence of outlier data that could skew automatically calculated thresholds (77) , whereas an expert human operator would be able to notice and correct for this problem. By utilizing both types of analyses in this study, the patterns of cell phenotypes were shown to be generally consistent under either method (Supplemental Figure 3B ) and therefore robust to the choice of gating technique.",

Autogating of CyTOF data was performed by setting a threshold at the 99th percentile of the distribution of observed intensities for each marker at the 8 hpi time point in mock-treated samples (36, 37) . This threshold was then applied to all other time points and treatments for that donor, which created event counts for positive and negative subpopulations. The comparative effects of infection condition on marker expression were calculated within each donor as the log 10 of the relative risk for positive marker frequency in the live populations extracted at each time point for each marker. Since manual gating and autogating strategies were determined to show grossly consistent patterns (Supplemental Figure 3B) , autogating was used for more extensive analyses (Figure 2 ). In these analyses, markers were ordered vertically by a hierarchical clustering of the median log 10 relative risks for that marker and time point. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the R hclust function using \"complete\" agglomeration and the Euclidean distance between row vectors (73) . Statistical significance was determined using a 2-sided Fisher's exact test at a threshold of \u03b1 = 10 -5 with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, similar to previous analyses of flow cytometry counts (78) . Statistical analyses for Figure 2 were performed with R version 3.2.2 (73) . Autogating was implemented using the flowCore (79) and flowStats (80) R packages from Bioconductor (versions 1.36.9 and 3.28.1, respectively).",
