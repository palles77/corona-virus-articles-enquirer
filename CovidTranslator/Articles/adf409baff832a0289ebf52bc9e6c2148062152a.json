            "text": "Objective: To describe the incidence, risk factors, and impact on mortality of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viral pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Design: Observational cohort study. Patients and methods: AKI was defined as risk, injury or failure, according to the RIFLE classification. Early and late AKI were defined as AKI occurring on intensive care unit (ICU) day 2 or before, or after ICU day 2, respectively. Demographic data and information on organ dysfunction were collected daily. Results: Of 84 patients, AKI developed in 43 patients (51%). Twenty (24%) needed renal replacement therapy. Early and late AKI were found in 28 (33%) and 15 (18%) patients, respectively. Patients with AKI, as compared with patients without AKI, had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and ICU mortality (72% versus 39%, p \\ 0.01) and presented on admission more marked cardiovascular, respiratory, and hematological dysfunction. Patients with early but not late AKI presented on admission higher APA-CHE II score and more marked organ dysfunction, as compared with patients without AKI. ICU mortality was higher in late versus early AKI (93% versus 61%, p \\ 0.001). On multivariate analysis, only APA-CHE II score and late but not early AKI [odds ratio (OR) 1.1 (95% confidence interval 1.0-1.1) and 15.1 (1.8-130.7), respectively] were associated with mortality. Conclusions: AKI is a frequent complication of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viral pneumonia. AKI developing after 2 days in ICU appears to be associated with different risk factors than early AKI, and is related to a higher mortality rate.",

Although we cannot explain the difference from the previously reported incidence of AKI in pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) [9] , it is possible that different treatment strategies could be related to differences in the prevalence of AKI. In fact, most of the patients in Sood et al.'s study [9] had AKI by the urine output criterion and only 25% by the serum creatinine criterion, whereas in our series patients were nonoliguric on average (mean urine output 0.9 ml/kg/h). The prevalence of acute kidney injury in general ICU patients reported in the SOAP study [17] was lower than in our cases (36%), but in that study [17] diagnostic criteria indicative of more severe renal injury (serum creatinine [3.5 mg/dl or urine output \\500 ml in 24 h) were used.",

Patients with early AKI had only slightly and nonsignificantly higher mortality rate than patients without AKI, whereas patients with late AKI had significantly higher mortality than patients with either non-AKI or early AKI. In the study by Payen et al. [17] , patients with early AKI had similar mortality rates to patients with late AKI. We cannot explain this discrepancy based on our results. Different availability of the use of RRT could explain these differences. Our results (higher mortality rate of late versus early AKI, and low mortality rate in those patients with early AKI whose renal function improves over time) are biologically plausible. Early AKI, probably determined to some extent by perfusion abnormalities in the context of insufficient or still ongoing resuscitation, is associated with a lower mortality rate than late AKI, which generally appears in combination with sepsis, multiple organ failure, and use of nephrotoxic agents. However, the lack of urinary indices or information concerning the response to fluid challenge makes our interpretation of the lower mortality rate of early versus late AKI purely speculative. It is very likely that the different mortality rate in early versus late AKI is due to the higher rate of resolution of renal dysfunction and the associated lesser requirement for RRT in early compared with late AKI.",

In addition, this lack of information prevents us from speculating as to the causes of the development of late AKI. In addition, chronic renal failure, as self-reported or recorded in the patients' medical records, was an exclusion criterion. However, we could not determine whether elevated baseline serum creatinine was early AKI or rather indicated stable chronic renal failure.

AKI that develops later in the course of the disease, appearing in the context of multiorgan dysfunction, is associated with a very high mortality rate.
