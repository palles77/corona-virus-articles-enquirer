            "text": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the most common gastrointestinal emergency in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), is a sudden-onset life-threatening disease that occurs primarily in preterm infants. NEC affects approximately 6-10% of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants, 1-4 with nearly 90% of all NEC cases occurring among this population and a case-fatality rate as high as 20-40%. 5 The etiology of NEC is not clearly established, but appears to be multifactorial, involving enteral feeding, vascular or perfusion-related gastrointestinal compromise, and bacterial invasion. 6, 7 Cases appear to occur sporadically with reports of clusters or outbreaks. 8, 9 No formal or consistent approach has been applied to these reports, however, regarding the definition and timing of apparent outbreaks or the cases associated with them. The case definition applied during outbreak investigations has often included suspected NEC and gastroenteritis cases, with outbreak durations of 8 to 10 weeks. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] An important clue to understanding the etiology of NEC is to understand the extent to which cases aggregate in a specific space and time as clusters, occur sporadically, or form clusters by chance alone. Fundamentally, there is no standard definition of a NEC cluster that might allow an investigator to determine whether a specific instance of several cases closely related in time represents a significant grouping. As a result, clusters or outbreaks of NEC tend to be defined subjectively; the detection and ascertainment of a cluster lie with observations.",

The objective of this study was to develop a statistically reliable method for defining clusters or outbreaks of NEC cases and to describe the pattern of NEC clusters.

A third Level III NICU was not included in this study because it is part of a children's hospital and does not contain a birthing center. Only 10 cases of NEC occurred at the excluded NICU over the course of the study period. As part of the Network's registry, all very low birth infants who were born in the Cincinnati region and developed NEC are captured in the registry. The Cincinnati region has approximately 30,000 annual births. A NEC case was defined using the modified Bell's staging criteria of stage IIA, IIB or IIIA (proven with no surgery including distension and/or signs of peritonitis, with x-ray evidence of pnuemotosis intestinalis) or stage IIIB (NEC confirmed at surgery). 25 The staging of NEC was recorded by clinicians using clinical and radiological information. Charts were reviewed and diagnosis was verified and recorded into the registry by trained research nurses. Infants who died within the first 24 hours of life were excluded from the analysis, as these infants would not have had the opportunity to either develop NEC or to be exposed to potential factors that may make them susceptible to NEC. Infants who survived beyond 24 hours were included because they would have had the opportunity to develop NEC.

First, to identify potential clusters, we applied a modified version of the scan test reported by Grimson and Mendelsohn. 27 This test employs the binomial distribution to detect current clusters of one or more days duration during the ongoing data collection and monitoring process. For the purpose of this study, we used this test retrospectively, in the same manner as reported by Grimson and Mendelsohn. 27 Because possible mechanisms of NEC transmission are unknown, uncertainty exists with regard to defining an important cluster window. A seven day window duration was based on subjective input from clinicians focusing on time frames during which cases may be considered as clustered. For each year, a time period of 7 days was selected to scan the time frame of 30 days. The maximum number of cases was counted in each time window and probability of less than 0.05 was used to identify statistically significant clusters.",

The scanning method allowed us to take into account how many previous NEC cases occurred in the past 30 days. Thus high numbers of NEC cases, possibly due to high numbers of ELBW infants in the past 30 days, would influence the significance of potential clusters of NEC in the most recent 7 days by making current clusters harder to detect statistically. We then used an incidence density measure of NEC to determine if the current rate seen was significantly higher than the rate of NEC that was expected within that particular NICU. This calculation takes into account the number of NICU-days of all infants at risk. In addition, no pattern was seen regarding the proportion or number of ELBW infants admitted to the NICU in the month prior to a cluster onset.",

From the perspective of identifying a common pathogenesis, the importance of this finding lies with the usefulness of a simple algorithm for detecting or identifying the occurrence of a cluster. For example, according to the findings of the current study, two NEC cases close together in time would not be considered a cluster. However, three or more NEC cases within the specified window have a high probability (>75%) of being a true cluster as classified by the concordance of two methods.

In 1972, Stein et al reported one of the first outbreaks consisting of 11 cases of NEC in a single nursery in South Africa over a 10-week period. 10 Chappell and Dinner reported an outbreak involving 20 cases over a 3-week period. 29 Rotbart and Levin described a 7-year period in which 193 cases of NEC occurred, with intermittent outbreaks that led to a closure of the nursery. 9 Many studies on outbreaks of NEC reported either very low rates of NEC 11-13, 17, 19, 22, 31 or did not report a background rate, 10, 14, 15, 18, 29, 32 leading the reader to assume that perhaps that particular site typically sees a minimal number of NEC cases within their institution. Our NICUs have a relatively endemic rate of NEC. Because most studies that report NEC outbreaks appear to originate from sites that do not typically report a baseline incidence of NEC, there is likely to be a reporting bias. Institutions that care for preterm infants, and have an incidence rate of NEC comparable to the literature (i.e. ~7% among VLBW infants), may not be reporting periods during which an increase in the number of NEC events occurs close in time. It is probable that institutions which consider NEC to be endemic are not at heightened awareness of this type of clustering. Some investigators also described both NEC (suspected and proven) and gastroenteritis cases occurring simultaneously. 10, 16, 23, 32, 33 Our study focused on a standardized definition of NEC in order to minimize the over-identification of clusters by including non-proven (suspect) NEC cases. This NEC definition required the presence of pneumatosis intestinalis, which likely excludes cases of spontaneous intestinal perforations. 34 NEC in infants with selected congenital anomalies may occur as a result of a different pathogenesis compared with premature infants without congenital anomalies. We included this small subset of infants for several reasons. It was not a purpose of this study to address factors that may increase the risk of NEC among VLBW infants, but to provide methods for detecting potential clusters of NEC statistically. Without understanding fully the pathogenesis of NEC for each infant, we did not want to risk missing any infant that could feasibly contribute to a cluster of NEC. Only three NEC cases, all of whom were premature, had a congenital anomaly: duodenal atresia (1), tetralogy of Fallot (2).",

This finding may speak to the importance of using two statistical methods for identifying a cluster. Because the scan test is based on the binomial distribution, results for the most recent time window (in this case 7 days) are dependent upon the number of NEC events in the previous 30 day window.

Intervals of other lengths, however, may be selected for monitoring. A longer interval opens up the possibility of capturing more cases. However, by increasing the denominator (number of patient-days), the overall rate of NEC for the time period of interest may be decreased, and clusters that were significant with a 7-day window may no longer be statistically significant in a longer cluster window. Within institutions that would typically have background rates of NEC that are considerably lower than 7%, an interval wider than the 7-day window would be appropriate to identify possible outbreaks.
