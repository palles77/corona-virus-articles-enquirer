Focussing on recent progress in revitalisation of industrial buildings in Hong Kong, this research investigates the Government regulations and market responses. It is found that simply relieving the regulations and institutional constraints in revitalisation does not work, either for the policy aim in a narrow sense or for the local economy in a broad sense. New revitalisation measures by the Government have led to new constraints in revitalisation. It is necessary to address the policy lag. This paper presents an opening statement of discussing effectiveness of revitalisation policy in terms of urban competitiveness. It advocates some general principles and goals been taken into account in making revitalisation policy, including industrial diversity, indigenously owned companies, social costs and quality of life.",

The term \"flatted factories\" is after the British expression for apartment. Mainly in response to land scarcity, flatted factories were originated in Hong Kong in the 1960s and some other districts also adopted this special arrangement such as Singapore (Lim, 2011) . Dim Sum, a Hong Kong local meal in which items are served separately from steam baskets stacked in tower formations as a kind of vertical culinary zoning, is a vivid analogy in describing Hong Kong's flatted factories as vertical and volumetric configuration (Shelton et al., 2011) .",

Economic restructuring decades on has rendered most of these industrial buildings no longer for the intended uses and therefore transformations are needed. There are many concepts related to this process: urban redevelopment, regeneration, renewal, revitalisation, reconstruction, rehabilitation and so on (Kamo, 2000) . These terms, similar in nature though, have subtleties in academia (Lees, 2003) . While the public-sector-initiated urban renewal in the 1960s was primarily concerned with the large-scale redevelopment of overcrowded inner city slum area, urban regeneration in the 1980s encouraged the involvement of private sector so as to spur more economic growth (Parvin & Mostafa, 2010) .",

From a modest beginning in the 1950s, the manufacturing sector grew rapidly in Hong Kong and it was the golden age of Hong Kong's industries. Such prosperity continued during the 1960s, mainly owing to the incorporation of Hong Kong into the global manufacturing and market networks under the backdrop that spatial relocation of manufacturing production in the world economy took place and international subcontracting networks emerged (Chiu & Liu, 2009: 26e29) . Increasing space requirement for manufacturing activities had led to prosperous construction of multi-storey industrial buildings. In the market, most of such industrial space was provided by the private sector (Tang & Tang, 1999) . In the 1970s, the tertiary sector replaced the manufacturing industry, becoming the leading economic sector in Hong Kong. Labour-intensive manufacturing industries in Hong Kong began to lose competitive advantage because of the rising production costs, particularly the rising labour costs and land rent.",

In the decade of 2000s, cross-border development and regional integration of Hong Kong and the PRD region experienced ups and downs. Hong Kong underwent economic recession and outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the year of 2003 and in the same year China entered WTO. The PRD region was provided with expanding domestic and global market. The PRD region was no longer relied so heavily on Hong Kong and was on her way towards more self-contained development (R.C.K. . In addition, the institutional environment in the PRD began to change with Guangdong provincial government and the Central Government emphasising more on environmental concern and labour right protection (Liao & Chan, 2011) . With the loss of competitive advantage in terms of costs of production, there was a new wave of industrial upgrade in the PRD region. The traditional \"store in front, factory behind\" model began to change with more and more \"stores in front\" relocated from Hong Kong to the PRD region and \"factory behind\" relocated from the PRD region to inland and other areas of lower cost of production (Liao & Chan, 2011; Yeh, 2006) . During the same period, Hong Kong's technology-based urban competitiveness building slowed down, and business-service competitiveness building approach began to take a leading role (Martinelli, Moulaert, & Novy, 2013) . With CEPA and the imaginaries of \"Pan-PRD\" released in 2004, the crossboundary development and regional integration was promoted significantly. Service sectors of Hong Kong were provided with expanding and easier-access domestic market in the Mainland (Chiu, 2006; Yeh & Xu, 2008) . Later, the \"Outline of the Plan for Reform and Development of the PRD Region (2008e2020)\" was released in 2009 by the State Council to further promote crossboundary cooperation by policies. However, industries in Hong Kong have been facing severer competition from her rivals including the old partnerdthe PRD region. The concern of \"marginalization of Hong Kong\" was raised not until the \"Pan-PRD\" imaginaries but since when Hong Kong has been losing her competitive advantage with the economic miracles happened cross the border (Martinelli et al., 2013) . Hong Kong is no longer of costsbased competitive advantage. Targeting mainly at international financial services, trading and logistics, tourism, and professional and producer services, Hong Kong repositioned itself to become Asia's world city (Kong, 2007) .",

In 2013, there used to be a proposal to convert industrial buildings into transitional, but was voted down later by the Government by concluding it is not practicable. It is stated by the Government that even if it is technically feasible, the considerable costs required in conversion would undermine its viability (Development Bureau HKSAR, 2011) . Currently, residential uses are still illegal in industrial buildings in Hong Kong (Fig. 3) , and thus the lofts with workliving mix-use those are very popular in Europe and in North America are not allowable in Hong Kong.

In addition, the land premiums for conversion will be waived upon satisfaction of certain conditions. The rationale behind these measures is to provide incentives, mainly in economic term, to encourage adaptive reuse of old industrial building, either redevelopment or conversion.

After the new package of measures by the Government since 2010 to promote revitalisation of industrial buildings, there have been 46 wholesale conversion cases with special waivers executed and 5 redevelopment cases with lease modifications executed by the end of 2013, as shown the Development Bureau HKSAR's specific website of \"Optimising the Use of Industrial Buildings\". Both the number and the proportion of wholesale conversion have increased. In this regard, the policy has achieved its intended objective to some extent. Shown by Fig. 4 , most of these cases are located at Kwan Tong, Cheung Sha Wan and Kwai Tsing, and there is a trend that these revitalisation cases spatially spread out gradually year by year from the districts closer to centre with highest accessibility and better quality of built environment to more remote areas with greater development potential. This phenomenon is not new: it has been tested by experiences both from the West and the East (Andres & Gr esillon, 2011). It is reported in a Wen Wei Po on January 25, 2010 that some developers in Hong Kong estimated that roughly 5 million could be saved every year if the application for conversion were granted and therefore the responses from the industry was overall positive (Law, 2010) .",

Using the prices in 1999 as a benchmark, the rising of price indices of flatted factories is even higher than all the other kinds of property including domestic, office and retail property. Although the government reorganised this problem and announced the Buyer Stamp Duty and Special Stamp Duty in 2012 and 2013 respectively to inhibit short-term speculative activities, both the rental and prices of private flatted factories decreased slightly and still remains quite high (Fig. 6) . The rising of both the rental and prices of industrial buildings results in negative impacts. Users occupying industrial buildings for industrial or non-industrial uses have become losers, especially low-income users including local artists who set up studios in industrial buildings, small business that use industrial buildings for genuine industrial uses or non-industrial uses and low-income groups who failed to live in public housing and live illegally in industrial buildings. Originally, cheap industrial spaces have served as nurturing grounds and the last shelters for these groups. Highdensity flatted industrial buildings concentrated in old industrial areas provide them with cheap rent or operation costs. The users can share cheap supply of production and usually enjoy convenient transportation with low living costs there. These industrial buildings nurture small business and shelter urban poor. However, the rising rental and prices of industrial buildings further narrowed down their living spaces. Some of them have been driven out from traffic-convenient location such as Kwun Tong in Kowloon to outer areas because of the vacating process to make way for revitalisation or because of unaffordable increasing rent in those areas (validated by data obtained from interviews with local artists conducted in March 2013 , October 2013 , and November 2013 .",

The Booming speculation and rapidly rising prices make the situation worse and lead to an extremely high capital threshold in revitalisation.

Let us show you two more cases. To make space for the construction of new public transportation infrastructure in Mong Kok, Water Supplies Department of the Hong Kong Government planned to relocate its offices in Mong Kok, Kowloon, to an industrial building. However, with the rapid and high rising of prices of flatted factories since the new revitalisation measures, the costs were extremely out of budget and the plan thus failed in January 2013. Another case is failure of the first redevelopment project of industrial building by the Urban Renewal Authority, the statutory body that established under the Urban Renewal Authority Ordinance to replace the Land Development Corporation to undertake, encourage, promote and facilitate the regeneration of the older urban areas of Hong Kong. The Urban Renewal Authority planned to redevelop an industrial building in the Hong Kong Island into public housing. The acquisition negotiation lasted for more than half a year. Again, with the high rising of prices, property owners of some units suddenly raised their price. In consideration of the costs and benefits, the Urban Renewal Authority formally withdrew the project in June 2013. Not only the Urban Renewal Authority, but also the Water Supplies Department of the Government has become third parties affected by the new revitalisation measures. This is in conflict with the policy targets of the 2010 new revitalisation measures to make better use of vacant and underused industrial spaces. Source: Rating and Valuation Department, 2013. 4 The Hong Kong Estate Agents Authority defines a confirmor sale, or sub-sale and sub-purchase, as one which occurs when a purchaser/confirmor enters into an agreement for sale and purchase of a property with the owner/vendor but before completion sub-sales the property to a sub-purchaser. As stated by the Government, this recent round of revitalisation policy is to \"promote revitalisation of older industrial buildings through encouraging redevelopment and wholesale conversion of vacant or under-utilised industrial buildings\", and the policy target is to \"provide readily available and suitable land and premises to meet Hong Kong's economic and social needs, including the development of higher value-added economic activities, such as the six economic areas identified by the Task Force on Economic Challenges. 5 \" (Development Bureau HKSAR, 2009 ).

These responses then change the policy background instantly, leading to policy lag and thus threaten policy effectiveness. Since the aim of revitalising industrial buildings in Hong Kong at the very beginning is for the re-building of urban competitiveness, it is necessary to discuss policy effectiveness from a perspective of urban competitiveness. Adopting a perspective of urban competitiveness and based on the experience of Hong Kong, we would like to generalise some key principles and goals that should be taken into account in revitalising industrial spaces. There are many factors determining urban competitiveness.

The all-in-one basket strategy is dangerous, and a city of relative higher industrial diversity could have larger resilience when encounter a crisis. The international competitiveness of the firms located in a place determines the competitiveness of that place partially (Rondinelli & Vastag, 1997: 347e366) . Special attention should also be paid on the ownership and decisionmaking power of companies. A competitive city should be able to gain control over its future, choosing among alternative futures rather than passively accepting its lot (Kresl & Singh, 1999) . Accordingly, the focus centres on the issue of ownership and decision-making power of companies. Begg (1999, 802) argues this point in detail stressing that \"cities with a preponderance of indigenously owned companies will be more competitive than those where external control dominates\". Therefore, the key words \"industrial diversity\" and \"indigenously owned companies\" together describe the situation that a city of relative higher industrial diversity and more local companies will be less easily impacted by changes of macro environment. Yet, for Hong Kong with service industrial taking up more than 90% of its GDP, there is still much space for improvement in regard of this point (Lau, 2003; Tsang, 1999) .",

Later, roles of other factors, such as innovation and knowledge, the Information Communication Technology sector, the physical environment, quality of life, and sustainability are given more attention when defining urban competitiveness (Cooke & Simmie, 2005; Malecki, 2002; Rogerson, 1999) . To date, particular attention has been given to the city's sustainable development and improvement of quality of life of local residents as the ultimate goal of urban competitiveness. Likewise, revitalisation of industrial buildings should not overemphasise economic dimension and neglecting the consequent social costs. More important, improving quality of life of local residents as well as sustainable urban development should be set as one of the ultimate targets in revitalisation policy. Through revitalising industrial buildings, the Hong Kong government dedicates to better use of land resources and economic development. Yet, current revitalisation measures of industrial buildings overemphasised economic dimension and neglect social costs. With more and more industrial buildings revitalised for office, hotel and commercial uses, low-income local artist, small business and urban poverty occupying industrial buildings are gradually driven out, but the poverty problem is not solved. What is more, this has intensified conflicts between users, developers and the Government. Currently, little evidence has been found that quality of life of local residents has been improved.",

Besides, large brownfields in revitalisation of industrial buildings in Hong Kong is identified by this paper, which is seldom pointed out in previous studies. And there is value in analysing responses from the Government, developers and the wider grassroots, and in investigating the initiatives behind.",

Although the three-pronged approached adopted by the government since 2010 successfully provide some incentives for private sector to initiate revitalisation, its unintended negative consequences are also significant. Under policy aiming at further easing policy constraints to promote revitalisation, the profit-driven and policy-sensitive market makes private industrial buildings vehicles for speculation, which on the contrary has led to revitalisation of industrial buildings been stuck fast. Government authorities themselves are burdened by it. Reflected by this case, even for Hong Kong adopting laissez-faire policies as an end of the spectrum, the market is still structural dependent on government intervention. Fast and sensitive market response would change the policy background instantly and lead to policy lag, even for those policies aiming at further easing institutional constraints.",
