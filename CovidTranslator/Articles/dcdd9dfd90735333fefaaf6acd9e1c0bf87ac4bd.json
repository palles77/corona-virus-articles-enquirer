            "text": "Phage display is the most widely used method for selecting binding molecules from recombinant antibody libraries. However, validation of the phage antibodies often requires early production of the cognate full-length immunoglobulin G (IgG). The conversion of phage library outputs to a full immunoglobulin via standard subcloning is time-consuming and limits the number of clones that can be evaluated. We have developed a novel system to convert scFvs from a phage display vector directly into IgGs without any in vitro subcloning steps. This new vector system, named pMINERVA, makes clever use of site-specific bacteriophage integrases that are expressed in E. coli and intron splicing that occurs within mammalian cells. Using this system, a phage display vector contains both bacterial and mammalian regulatory regions that support antibody expression in E. coli and mammalian cells. A single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody is expressed on the surface of bacteriophage M13 as a genetic fusion to the gpIII coat protein. The scFv is converted to an IgG that can be expressed in mammalian cells by transducing a second E. coli strain. In that strain, the phiC31 recombinase fuses the heavy chain constant domain from an acceptor plasmid to the heavy chain variable domain and introduces controlling elements upstream of the light chain variable domain. Splicing in mammalian cells removes a synthetic intron containing the M13 gpIII gene to produce the fusion of the light chain variable domain to the constant domain. We show that phage displaying a scFv and recombinant IgGs generated using this system are expressed at wild-type levels and retain normal function. Use of the pMINERVA completely eliminates the labor-intensive subcloning and DNA sequence confirmation steps currently needed to convert a scFv into a functional IgG Ab.",

Yet technologies for proteomics have not advanced much in the last 30 to 40 years. Gene expression does not always correlate with protein abundance levels. And post-translational modifications (especially important in cell signaling) cannot be studied at the nucleic acid level. Improved methods for deriving high quality affinity reagents are needed to keep up with the 'explosion' of genomics information. Currently, less than half of around 6,000 routinely-used commercial antibodies (Abs) recognize only their specified targets (1, 2) , and according to a publication in Nature Methods, over $350 million in biomedical research is wasted yearly in the United States alone due to poorly characterized Abs (3) . To overcome this problem, there is a need for all Abs to be defined by their sequences and made recombinant, such that researchers will be able to use the same binding reagents under the same conditions (2) (3) (4) (5) . However, while a number of approaches for generating recombinant affinity reagents exist (6) (7) (8) (9) , the high costs and low throughput of current technologies represent significant roadblocks to the development of a comprehensive and broadly available resource of renewable affinity reagents.",

The system takes advantage of two genetic principles, recombination in E.coli (14) and splicing in mammalian cells (15, 16) . A phage display vector contains both bacterial and mammalian regulatory regions that support antibody expression in bacteria and mammalian systems. The scFv is expressed as a fusion to the bacteriophage M13 gp3 gene in bacteria and converted to an IgG that can be expressed in mammalian cells by transducing the phagemid into a second E.coli F + strain. In that strain, the phiC31 serine integrase is used to fuse the heavy chain constant domain (C H ) from an acceptor plasmid to the heavy chain variable domain (V H ) and to introduce controlling elements upstream of the light chain variable domain (V L ) (Fig. 1 ). Positive selection for the recombination events is built into the system (Fig. 1) . To generate the light-chain V L -C L fusion, mammalian splice sites flank the M13 gIII gene, allowing the V L to be fused to the light chain constant domain (C L ) in mammalian cells (Fig. 1 ). Using the designed vector system, a single shuttle vector can be employed for phage library construction, phage display screening, and IgG antibody production in mammalian cells. Here, we demonstrate the utility of the features of this 'pMINERVA' subcloning system and proof-of-concept functional testing.",

A promoterless chloramphenicol resistance (camR) gene was placed 3\u2032 of the phiC31 integrase attB site on the same plasmid (pAcceptor). Successful integration of the phagemid (pDonor) into the pAcceptor plasmid places an E. coli promotor upstream of the pAcceptor camR gene and produces a bicistronic gene-pair composed of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and camR genes (Fig. 3a) . The cells that are harboring this resulting co-integrated plasmid thereby become chloramphenicol resistant. The phiC31-mediated integration efficiency was tested in E. coli by transforming a pAcceptor TG1 strain with the pDonor plasmid and measuring the percent of ampicillinresistant transformants converting to camR. Conversion would only occur as a result of successful co-integration. The ratio of chloramphenicol-resistant (camR) transformants to ampicillin-resistant (ampR) transformants was compared with the ratio of camR to ampR transformants using an already co-integrated plasmid in TG1 cells. Our results (Fig. 3b) demonstrate that the phiC31 integrase is able to site-specifically recombine the pDonor vector into a pAcceptor vector at >90% efficiency. No chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were obtained when the pDonor lacked the attP site (data not shown).",

We designed a synthetic intron containing the M13 gpIII gene flanked by consensus 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice site sequences. In E. coli, the scFv is expressed on the surface of bacteriophage M13 as a genetic fusion to the gpIII gene. In mammalian cells, the intron containing the gpIII gene is excised, creating a fusion of the V L to the C L (Fig. 1) . In the absence of proper splicing, the C L will be out of frame with the V L , and functional IgG cannot be produced. As shown in figure 4a, introduction of splice sites between the scFv and gpIII gene does not interfere with phage production or function.

Recombinases such as Cre and FLP are commonly used for genome engineering in multiple organisms (28) (29) (30) . However, the efficiency of integration with these enzymes is low because the enzymes perform both integration and excision with the same target sites.

We have shown here that phiC31 is greater than 90% efficient at inducing recombination between two plasmids in E. coli.

Other signal peptides that work in both mammalian and bacterial systems have been reported (15) and can be tested for improved expression in our system. We utilized the human EF1a promoter to build our dual function promoter system, but other promoters that enable high-level protein expression in mammalian cells, including the CMV promoter, can be tested. Our catenated promoter system (24) includes the polyhedron promoter such that insect cells could be used as an alternative to HEK-293 cells for high-throughput IgG production.",

Combining the pMINERVA system with our previous improvements, AXM mutagenesis (55), Phage ESCape (56) , and phage libraries using entirely pre-defined complementarity determining regions (CDR) (57) we present a platform for the rapid generation of recombinant monoclonal Abs in as few as three weeks and at a cost comparable to that of polyclonal antibodies. The scFv Abs encoded on the pDonor vector as M13gpIII-fusions can be screened in a phage display biopanning procedure to identify a phagemid encoding a scFv with the desired biophysical properties. This phagemid is transduced into an E. coli strain expressing phiC31 integrase and harboring an IgG acceptor vector. The product of the recombination event introduces a polyadenylation signal site adjacent to the 3\u2032 end of the C H gene. Furthermore, the recombination event introduces both a mammalian promoter and functional protein initiation site 5\u2032 to the V L gene. Of special note, the linker between the V H and V L domains of the scFv is composed of a phiC31 36-bp attP site that is able to function as both a: i) peptide linker between the heavy and light variable domains, and ii) 36-bp functional substrate for phiC31 integrase.

Anti-M13 antibody that is conjugated to Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used for phage detection and the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed with Ultra Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) reagent.

The attB site (lower case DNA sequence) in pAcceptor was placed 5\" of the promoter-less camR gene. Successful recombination between the attP and attB sites on the two plasmids in the presence of the phiC31 integrase (blue dashed line) generates the co-integrant (pMINERVA; bottom sequence) and fuses an E. coli promoter in front of the bicistronic heavy chain-Cam R message.

The ratio of colonies on the ampicillin plates to the chloramphenicol plates was calculated. Immunol Methods. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 April 01.",

In the catenated promoter system, the ATGs downstream of the mammalian EF1a promoter (P EF1a ) are removed from the downstream polyhedron (not shown) and PhoA bacterial promoter. The Kozak sequence and E.coli ribosomal binding site (RBS) are designed such that the first ATG fMet start site for either bacterial, insect (not shown) or mammalian expression is identical. In this case, the same signal sequence (SigPep) is used for all three organisms. (B) Promoter type Pro splice . In this dual function promoter, the LacPO and bacterial signal peptide (SigPep E.c. ) sequence are contained within the mammalian intron. The bacterial signal peptide sequence overlaps the 3\u2032 splice site (3\u2032ss). In E. coli, transcription from the bacterial promoter within the mammalian intron results in the expression of the scFv in the bacterial periplasm fused to the M13 gpIII protein in an amber-suppressing strain of E.coli (for example, TG1). In mammalian cells, intron splicing of the mRNA at the 5\u2032 (5\u2032ss) and 3\u2032ss removes the bacterial LacPO regulatory sequences located within the intron. Intron splicing generates the mammalian signal sequence. (C) Phage-scFv production from Pro cat and Pro splice promoters. Phage were tested for binding to purified target antigen and to a non-relevant control antigen in a phage ELISA.
