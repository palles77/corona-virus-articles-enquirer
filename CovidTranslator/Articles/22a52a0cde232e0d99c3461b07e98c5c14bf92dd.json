The lack of such common standards combined with unfriendly interfaces make it difficult for biologists to learn how to use these tools and to translate the data formats from one to another. Consequently, the construction of an integrative bioinformatics platform to facilitate biologists\u00d5 research is an urgent and challenging task. KDE Bioscience is a java-based software platform that collects a variety of bioinformatics tools and provides a workflow mechanism to integrate them. Nucleotide and protein sequences from local flat files, web sites, and relational databases can be entered, annotated, and aligned. Several home-made or 3rd-party viewers are built-in to provide visualization of annotations or alignments. KDE Bioscience can also be deployed in client-server mode where simultaneous execution of the same workflow is supported for multiple users. Moreover, workflows can be published as web pages that can be executed from a web browser. The power of KDE Bioscience comes from the integrated algorithms and data sources. With its generic workflow mechanism other novel calculations and simulations can be integrated to augment the current sequence analysis functions. Because of this flexible and extensible architecture, KDE Bioscience makes an ideal integrated informatics environment for future bioinformatics or systems biology research.",

Some existing efforts include Biopipe [8] , BioWBI [9] , Taverna [10] , Wildfire [11] , etc. All of them provide mechanism to integrate bioinformatics programs into workflows. Biopipe is based on programming language perl. It looks lack of user-friendly interface for building workflow so far. BioWBI and Tarverna use Web-Services for components to construct workflows. However, to convert a 3rd-party program into Web-Services, they lack of integrative GUI environment. Wildfire aims at using workflow to provide huge computing capability to bioinformatics application. However, there is no integrative environment provided for multiple users to collaborate in the same large-scale bioinformatics project. In this paper, we present a significant integrative informatics platform, Knowledge Discovery Environment of Bioscience (KDE Bioscience), which is supposed to provide a solution of integration of biological data, algorithms, computing hardware, and biologist intelligence for bioinformatics.",
