The first set of 50 control farms was selected randomly from veterinary practices which had never observed a BNP case on the farms they serviced. The second set of 50 control farms was matched by the veterinary practices which had provided case farms. Two separate analyses were conducted: (1) case farms (n = 56) vs. randomly selected control farms (n = 50) and (2) case farms (n = 56) vs. a matched set of control farms (n = 50). All variables with p < 0.2 in the univariable analysis were included in stepwise logistic regression models. In the first analysis, only the use of PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 1292 (95% CI: 114-14707). In the second analysis, conditional logistic regression models did not converge, therefore non-conditional logistic regression models were conducted. In the non-conditional analysis five variables remained in the model, three of which were negatively associated with BNP: the use of vitamin E and selenium, the frequent use of mastitis tubes, and the use of stem growth regulators in grain production. The use of prophylactic measures (such as control of parasites or vaccination of calves against respiratory disease) was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 14.3 as well as the use of PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine with an odds ratio of 426 (95% CI: 20-9095).",

There were no obvious irregularities in the relative frequency of the breed distribution Corbi\u00e8re et al., 2009; Doll et al., 2009; Friedrich et al., 2009b; Gentile et al., 2009; Kappe et al., 2010; Pardon et al., 2010; Penny et al., 2009; Smolenaars and Mars, 2009 ). Data available to the different research groups on the frequency of occurrence of BNP are probably incomplete because BNP is not notifiable in any country and the disease may be overlooked because it is rare and calves may die without farmers realising that it was BNP. Various studies failed to find evidence of specific infections or intoxications (Doll et al., 2009 (Doll et al., , 2010 Friedrich et al., 2010; Pardon et al., 2010) . Kappe et al. (2010) suggested an association between BNP and the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2), as they identified PCV-2-DNA in 5 of 25 BNP calves and in 1 of 8 control calves. However, this finding could not be confirmed by Willoughby et al. (2010) . At the beginning of the study the clinical picture of the disease and some information about the occurrence of the disease in some European countries were known. Assumptions about potential causes or involvement of specific agents included vaccines and other prophylactic measures or toxins, as well as chemicals used in agriculture (such as crop stem growth regulators, e.g. chlorocholine chloride, CCC -these are chemicals that reduce the stem growth of crop and thus reduce the risk of stem breakage). The increase of BNP cases and the first cases of Bluetongue (BT) occurred roughly at the same time in Germany. This temporal correlation between BNP and BT and the subsequent legal obligation to vaccinate against BT, led to the assumption of a causal link between either the disease or the vaccination campaign against BT and BNP (unpublished statements) . The aim of the present study was to conduct a case control study to investigate different risk factors for BNP within southern Germany. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study on this subject.",

In setting up the study and in reporting it, the STROBE guidelines were followed whenever possible (von Elm et al., 2008) . The unit of analysis in this study was farm. All factors hypothesised as associated with BNP at the beginning of the study were included in the questionnaire; hence hypotheses regarding potential risk factors covered a wide range of potential management, health and nutritional factors as applied prior to the study. The case control study was designed with the intention of including 50 case farms (with at least one confirmed case of BNP) and respective control farms (without reported or known cases of BNP in calves). With this sample size an odds ratio of 3.5 for a risk factor prevalent at 20% with 80% power would be significant with p \u2264 0.05 in an unconditional logistic regression. Another study (unpublished) revealed that several BNP farms were recorded by some veterinary practices, whereas no cases were seen by neighbouring practices, suggesting that differences existed between practices in the occurrence of BNP or in diagnosing or reporting BNP (BNP is not notifiable). Therefore, the study design included a random control set and a control set matched on veterinary practice, each set containing 50 control farms. Interviews with farmers of case farms were conducted between beginning of 2009 and June 2010 and with farmers of control farms between November 2009 and June 2010. In the following, BNP farms are referred to as \"cases\" and control farms as \"controls\".",

The post mortem demonstration of bone marrow depletion in calves less than four weeks of age was considered the gold standard even in the absence of information on clinical signs and/or haematological changes. In calves without post mortem examination, clinical signs indicative of BNP plus haematological changes (thrombocytopenia [<200 G/L] (St\u00f6ber and Gr\u00fcnder, 1990) and leukocytopenia [<4 G/L] (Kraft et al., 2005) ) had to be present for case confirmation.

With regard to feeding of cows and calves, farmers were asked for all commonly used feed components and feed additives such as propylene glycol, propionate, glycerine, and fermentation additives for silage. Preventive measures taken at the farm were divided into vaccinations (coded as specific variables) and in general preventive measures such as antiparasitic prophylactic measures.

Since a possible connection between the vaccine PregSure \u00ae BVD and BNP had already been discussed in the farming press (agrarheute.com, 2009), farm managers using PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine might have been more likely than farmers not using PregSure \u00ae BVD, to bring calves to the clinic or submit blood samples in hope of having the cases documented \"officially\", with a view of later indemnity claims. But this topic was never brought up by farmers during interviews. Moreover, selecting more than half of case farms at random eliminated the risk of preferential selection of farmers using or not using specific vaccines. Additionally many interviews were conducted before the mentioned press-release. Therefore, we are confident that selection bias was limited. The definition of the control farms was more critical, as BNP could have occurred unnoticed, either in subclinical form or in undiagnosed deaths. In addition, BNP cases could have occurred on control farms after the interview. This potential bias could not be ruled out. However, a misclassification of controls was likely to be independent of the use of PregSure \u00ae . Such non-differential misclassification would therefore have reduced but not increased the observed Table 3 Results of the multivariable logistic regression models in a study on BNP in southern Germany (2008-2010) using parameters statistically significant in the univariate analysis in comparing case farms against the farms of two control groups.",

One of the measures taken to reduce such bias was instructing interviewers to avoid leading questions. Seven farmers were unwilling to participate, due to time constraints or unknown reasons. If these unknown reasons were associated with the disease, then this might have introduced some bias. However, as the answers of the participating farm managers varied considerably in the use of certain prophylactic measures or other factors, it is considered unlikely that this small number of non-participating farmers had an effect on the outcome of the analysis. Recall bias during the interviews could not be avoided. In general data were asked for the period of two years prior to the interview. Some data, like the use of vaccines, were asked for the period of the last five years. No documentation of vaccination on the level of individual animals was available, as there is no legal obligation to record the data for vaccinations in Germany, which would have indicated the exact time of administration of vaccine for each individual cow. However, many farmers stated they had used vaccines or applied other prophylactic measures five or more years previously, indicating that recall bias was minimal. On most farms vaccinations are applied for several years consecutively, not as a one-year measure. It was not possible to record the vaccination schemes on each farm, as this often has changed over the years and also is variable within the farms. In a further study it should be tried to obtain this data more detailed in order to compare different vaccination schemes. On the other hand, we are confident, that the vaccination-status of the farms (having vaccinated within the last five years: yes/no) is precise, as farmers and veterinarians were asked for vaccinations conducted on the farm. Recall bias was more likely concerning specific details of affected calves but not that cases had occurred at all. These details were not part of the present study. Therefore we believe that recall bias was, if it occurred, equally in case and control farms, and therefore unlikely to have had any considerable effect on the inferences from this study.",

In the questionnaire it was asked explicitly for contact with these plants, either directly or through hay and silage, but only few farm owners (case farms 3/50; control farms 5/100) mentioned that access to these plants could not be excluded completely.

Also, only in few case and control farms access to rodenticides could not be excluded completely for animals.

However, this also caused convergence problems as 55 of the 56 case farmers had used this vaccine, while only two of the randomly selected set of 50 control farmers and 13 of the matched set of 50 control farmers used this vaccine. This resulted in very high crude odds ratios of 1292 and 156 for random and matched controls, respectively. The lower odds ratio of the matched controls for the use of PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine was not surprising because veterinary practices tended to use only one or two specific BVD vaccines for client farms due to logistic and economic reasons. Matching for practice therefore reduced the chance of detecting an association with vaccine type.",

Including PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine into the multivariable analyses caused quasi-complete separation of the data, and therefore non-convergence of several logistic regression models. This often occurs in small samples with highly predictive variables. Despite the use of a correction recommended by Firth (Webb et al., 2004) for such circumstances, PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine remained the only significant variable in the model with random controls (data not shown). A bias causing an effect size as large as this would have to be huge and should be obvious. We therefore deem it was highly unlikely that the PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine effect was caused by selection bias or confounding. Including such a large number of farm management variables in the analysis was a priori a means to reduce confounding by any type of farm level variables. The exclusion of PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine from the analysis of case and random control farms in a second step was done in order to identify further risk factors.",

Feeding of barley was also negatively associated with the occurrence of BNP. However, there is no obvious reason, why it would reduce the risk of having BNP on the farm. Barley has been used for many years in traditional feeding of cattle in southern Germany (Voigt et al., 1993) . Other factors which were negatively associated with the occurrence of BNP were the use of teat dips, the frequent use of mastitis tubes and the supplementation of vitamin E and selenium. The effect of vitamin E and selenium has to be interpreted with caution as it was not statistically significant in the univariable analysis and as it showed a very wide confidence interval in the logistic regression analysis. It is therefore regarded as spurious. The use of teat dips and mastitis tubes as well as the three other factors, which were positively associated with the occurrence of BNP in the two analyses, the use of dam vaccination against calf diarrhoea, the more frequent occurrence of respiratory health problems in calves and applying other prophylactic measures (e.g. vaccination against respiratory diseases in calves, parasite control) all relate to animal health issues.",

It could be speculated that in herds where BNP has been observed, additional calves were affected subclinically, and therefore a reduction in disease resistance resulted in an increase of the incidence of respiratory disease in these herds (Lorenz et al., 2011) . This cannot be clarified as the questionnaire did not ask if the frequency of health problems in calves had increased before or after the appearance of BNP. Control farmers used more often teat dips and more frequently mastitis tubes than case farmers. The association of case farms with a more frequent use of dam vaccination agrees with reports of veterinarians that more progressive farms that are trying to achieve a good health status in their animals are affected by BNP. The use of dam vaccination was also positively associated with the use of PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine, but stratifying for it only reduced the strong effect of PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine to a relatively small extent. On the other hand, more investment into animal health, including vaccinations and for example the use of teat dips, could be a farmer response to the occurrence of disease. In the present study it is not possible to state if prophylactic measures have been implemented to maintain good animal health or whether they were implemented to improve animal health, as the study participants were not asked specifically on this. A further study addresses this issue in more detail. Hence, the interpretation of associations between BNP and prophylactic measures in general is equivocal.",

We addressed this dilemma by comparing several adjusted odds ratios for the association between PregSure \u00ae BVD and the occurrence of BNP by stratification for other significant variables using the Mantel-Haenszel technique. In the end, the effect of PregSure \u00ae BVD remained unequivocally strong for both control sets, random and matched. Adjusted odds ratios were relatively similar, ranging from 485 to 713. Despite the fact that these were lower than the crude effect in the matched set, PregSure \u00ae BVD had the strongest association with BNP among all variables studied. Even though other variables may also be associated with BNP, our data strongly suggest that a true effect of PregSure \u00ae BVD on BNP could not be ruled out. We arrived at this conclusion after evaluating a very large number of farm management and farming systems variables using a study design with only few sources of bias (2 control groups) and critical and ambitious multifactorial analysis.",

This result is compatible with the results of other authors (Pardon et al., 2009 ).
