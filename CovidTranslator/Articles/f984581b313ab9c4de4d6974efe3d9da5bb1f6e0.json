Boiling may reduce the immunogenicity of many antigens. More recently, the technology to transform fruit and vegetable plants have become perfected. We transformed carrot plants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens to generate plants (which can be eaten raw) transgenic for an immunodominant antigen of the measles virus, a major pathogen in man. The hemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein is the principle target of neutralizing and protective antibodies against measles. Copy numbers of the H transgene were verified by Southern blot and specific transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR. The H protein was detected by western blot in the membrane fraction of transformed carrot plants. The recombinant protein seemed to have a 8% lower molecular weight than the viral protein. Although this suggests a different glycosylation pattern, proper folding of the transgenic protein was confirmed by conformationaldependent monoclonal antibodies. Immunization of mice with leaf or root extracts induced high titres of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies that cross-reacted strongly with the measles virus and neutralized the virus in vitro. These results demonstrate that transgenic carrot plants can be used as an efficient expression system to produce highly immunogenic viral antigens. Our study may pave the way towards an edible vaccine against measles which could be complementary to the current live-attenuated vaccine.",

            "text": "The development of genetic transformation technology has allowed the expression of foreign genes in an increasing number of plant species. The use of plants for the production of foreign antigen proteins that could serve as experimental immunogens was first reported in the early 1990s (Cardineau and Curtis, 1990; Mason et al., 1992) . Since then, a number of viral and bacterial antigens have been expressed in a variety of plant species (McGarvey et al., 1995; Thanavala et al., 1995; Carrillo et al., 1998; Gomez et al., 1998; Modelska et al., 1998; Tacket et al., 1998; Wigdorovitz et al., 1999) . Despite differences in post-translational processing viral and bacterial antigens preserved their immunogenic properties when produced in plants and induced cross-reactive and sometimes neutralizing and protective antibodies. Plants could therefore be an inexpensive source of antigens that could be easily purified for parenteral inoculation (Thanavala et al., 1995; Gomez et al., 1998) . Moreover, oral ingestion of plants expressing high levels of antigens bear the potential of edible vaccines (Kong et al., 2001) . Strategies based on potent mucosal adjuvants such as cholera toxin and heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (Haq et al., 1995; Arakawa et al., 1998a, b) may pave the road for oral immunization.",

For most proteins of human pathogens expressed in edible plants, potatoes were used, which are normally boiled before consumption (Mason et al., 1996; Arakawa et al., 1998a; Richter et al., 2000; Kong et al., 2001) . It can be anticipated that many antigens would not resist cooking without being denatured and that cooked plant material is less immunogenic than raw plants (Kong et al., 2001) . Therefore, there is a need to develop other and more appropriate transgenic plant species that can serve as edible vaccines. The technology for creating other transgenic edible plants, including fruits and vegetables has been further perfected (Schenk et al., 2001; Brodzik et al. 2000) . We chose to transform transgenic carrots, which can be grown in most parts of the world, which can be eaten both raw and cooked, and are part of the early diet of infants.",

After a single injection, seroconversion rates are high, complications are rare and protection is long-lasting. These advantages are difficult to match by other experimental measles vaccine. However, after 25 years 50% of vaccinees are thought to have lost protective levels of antibodies (Mossong et al., 1999) . Revaccination with an oral vaccine which would boost the residual immunity would be a preferred strategy since it can be selfadministered, requires less training of health workers and avoids the risks associated with needle injections. The potential of a parenteral/oral prime-booster schedule has been demonstrated for a number of pathogens (Kong et al., 2001; Mantis et al., 2001) . Such a schedule is probably less liable to problems of weak and variable responses after oral vaccination. A strategy based on oral vaccination could be a particularly useful for large-scale booster immunization in developing countries where the need to deliver parenteral vaccines may hamper eradication efforts.",

In this vector, the MV-H sequence was under the control of the constitutively expressed cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter fused to the tobacco etch virus (TEV) 5 -untranslated region, a translational enhancer, and the CaMV 35S terminator (Odell et al., 1985; Pietrzak et al., 1986) . These control sequences were flanked with HindIII restriction sites that allowed their transfer, together with the H sequence, into the T-DNA region presents in binary vector pBIN19 (Bevan, 1984) , creating the recombinant plasmid pBIN19-MVH. The T-DNA region, delimited by the right and left border sequences, also contains the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene (nptII) that provides neomycin and kanamycin resistance to transformed plants ( Figure 1 ). After subcloning of the expression cassette in pBIN19 and transformation of XL1-Blue cells kanamycin-resistant colonies were picked and checked for the presence of the expression cassette by PCR and automated sequencing (373 A model, Perkin Elmer, Netherlands). Plasmid DNA was then isolated from a positive clone and introduced in Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 by electroporation (25 \u00b5F, 2500 V, 400 ). Transformed bacteria were selected on YEB-agar solid medium containing 50 \u00b5g/ml kanamycin (28 \u2022 C, 48 h) and were used for subsequent carrot transformation.",

Sterilized carrot seeds (Herrera-Estrella and Simpson, 1988; Daucus carota cv. Senkou-Gosun, kindly given by Dr Tokuji, Japan) were sown in 0.8% agar in the dark at 25 \u2022 C. After 14 days hypocotyl segments were harvested in Gamborg B5 liquid medium (B5) supplemented with 3% sucrose and with the phytohormone 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (1 mg/l) for 48 h at 25 \u2022 C. After washing, the segments were placed for 5 days on phytohormone-free B5 solid medium (0.8% agar) containing 3% sucrose. The hypocotyl fragments were then transformed by immersion (2 h) in the bacterial suspension of A. tumefaciens containing the recombinant pBIN19-MVH binary plasmid. The segments were further co-cultured in the dark at 25 \u2022 C with the bacteria on B5 solid medium with 3% sucrose. Five days later, the explants were washed with B5 medium containing cefotaxime (250 mg/l) to kill remaining agrobacteria. Explants were grown in darkness at 25 \u2022 C on B5 solid medium containing cefotaxime (250 mg/l) and geneticin (10 mg/l) for the selective growth of transgenic cells. After 4 weeks of selection, somatic embryos resistant to geneticin appeared on the hypocotyl segments. Each hypocotyl usually gave rise to a few embryos. Embryos were subcultured and rooted on selective medium at 25 \u2022 C under light. Plantlets with adequate roots were transferred to potting soil and grown in a greenhouse under normal light and humidity conditions. Several lines of transgenic carrots were obtained and further studied.",

            "text": "Under the fluorescence microscope, a fusion protein of MV-H with the green fluorescence protein (GFP) expressed in tobacco protoplasts showed a predominant association with the plasma membrane (data not shown). The membrane fraction of carrot cells produced a strong signal in western blot correspond-ing to an estimated 2 \u00b5g of specific protein per gram of wet weight. Interestingly, the transgenic protein migrated faster in SDS-PAGE than the same protein produced in mammalian cells, suggesting a size difference of about 6 kDa. A similar observation was made when the rabies virus glycoprotein G was expressed in plants (McGarvey et al., 1995) . The expression of the C-terminally fused GFP demonstrates that the H protein is fully translated and that the difference in apparent size is most probably due to post-translational modifications. In the virus, the Edmonston strain H protein undergoes glycosylation at 4 of the 5 predicted N-glycosylation sites (Hu et al., 1994) . It has been shown that glycosylation of mammalian proteins is efficient in plants, but normally different carbohydrate side chains are utilized (Bardor et al., 1999) . The complex glycans of plants are often smaller than those of animals, partially because they lack sialic acid (Faye et al., 1993) . In insect cells, which also lack sialic acid, the reduced size of the recombinant H protein was explained by a difference in glycosylation (Vialard et al., 1990) . Authentic post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and cystine-bridge formation are thought to be important for intracellular trafficking (Hu and Norrby, 1995) as well as the antigenic conformation of the H protein (Hu et al., 1994; Hu and Norrby, 1995) .",

Although plants can be used as efficient bioreactors for producing antigens, the full potential of plant-based vaccines becomes apparent when immunogenicity can be demonstrated after oral ingestion. A frequent problem of plant-based vaccines is that the response after oral delivery is inconsistent and variable. Sometimes even low levels of antigen can give an effective response after oral administration in mice (Mason et al., 1996; Wigdorovitz et al., 1999) and man (Kapusta et al., 1999) . In other cases mucosal immunity was improved by mucosal adjuvants (Arakawa et al., 1998b; Kong et al., 2001) . In the study by Huang et al. (2001) , the immune response after oral administration of transgenic tobacco was very weak even when exceedingly high levels (3 times 1 mg) of CTB where co-administered. However, when experimental oral vaccines were given after parenteral priming, results were more consistent than after oral immunization alone (Kong et al., 2001; Mantis et al., 2001) . Therefore, a prime booster schedule with an oral vaccine could be an attractive alternative when immunity to the current (injectable) live-attenuated measles vaccine wanes in adults. Further studies are required to confirm the efficacy of the carrot plant expressed measles antigen in such a scenario.",
