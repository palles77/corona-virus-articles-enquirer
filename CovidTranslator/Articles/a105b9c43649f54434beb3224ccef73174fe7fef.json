The current financial information systems serve to provide latest information. However, they lack sophisticated analytical tools. This paper proposes a new architecture for financial information systems. The developed prototype is entitled as the Multi-level and Interactive Stock Market Investment System (MISMIS). It is specially designed for investors to build their financial models to forecast stock price and index. The performance of the financial models can be evaluated on a virtual trading platform. There are other features in MISMIS that are tailor-made to handle financial data; these include synchronized time frame, time series prediction techniques, preprocessing and transformation functions, multi-level modeling and interactive user interface. To illustrate the capability of MISMIS, we have evaluated strategies of trading the future options of Hang Seng Index (HSI). We find that historical HSI, Dow Jones Index, property price index, retailing sales figure, prime lending rate, and consumer price index in Hong Kong are essential factors affecting the performance of the trading of HSI's future option. Also there are some feedbacks from the in-depth interviews of six financial consultant upon how they perceived the prototype MISMIS.",

            "text": "In the stock market, many investors attempt to earn extra gain or to protect their savings from shrinking due to inflation. However, the existing financial information systems (FIS) are too much focusing on dissemination of information such as financial news or latest stock value. They may equip with simple stock trading heuristics. For example, a buy signal is horned if the curve of the 7-days moving average crosses and is above the 50-days moving average. They are indeed lack of analytical tools to do sophisticated analyses. Nowadays, some statistical tools such as Clementine have armed with advanced techniques particularly on time series forecasting such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and artificial neural network. Nevertheless, they provide a platform for general applications and do not have a specific financial domain. For example, they do not provide adequate support on virtual trading environment for investors to try out their trading strategies. In order to facilitate investors for their decision making in stock trading, this paper proposes a new architecture of FIS which integrates the advanced time series forecasting techniques with a virtual trading platform under a GUI environment. This development would fit into the trend of using advanced techniques such as data mining method and knowledge-based decision supporting tool to predict or evaluate business performance [32, 33, 35] . This paper describes the prototype of a Multi-level and Interactive Stock Market Investment System (MISMIS) which combines different area -financial economics, prediction techniques, and dynamical systems theory, in handling financial data. MISMIS enables investors to build their prediction models interactively by dragging various pre-defined functions. The prediction outcomes can also be fed into another prediction model as input. Let us say, the Hang Seng Index can be predicted by feeding the prediction outcomes of those composite stock prices. It may result in having a model that produces more reliable predictions. The prediction will subsequently be fitted into a trading strategy and be evaluated on a virtual trading platform. Performance metrics will be reported to users who would adjust the model parameters for further enhancement on the prediction model. Hence, MISMIS assists on the decision making of an investor in the stock trading. This prototype MISMIS has also been evaluated by some consultants in financial investment. They found this prototype once being launched would be much welcome by most individual investors.",

According to Fama [12] , an 'efficient' market, securities will be appropriately priced upon all available information. If a market is efficient, no information or analysis can be expected to result in outperformance of an appropriate benchmark. Fama believed that an 'efficient' market is defined as a market where there are large numbers of rational, profit-maximizers actively competing, with each trying to predict future market values of individual securities, and where important current information is almost freely available to all participants. In other words, in an efficient market at any point in time the actual price of a security will be a good estimate of its intrinsic value. Most importantly, Efficient Market Hypothesis [12] states that at any given time, security prices fully reflect all available information. It implies that stock price value could be calculated by suitable indictors. Thus prediction of stock market only makes sense if the market is an efficient one. In this regard, building a financial information system would help investors in their decision making.",

Ritchie [26] , based on fundamental analysis, designed to assess important economic, political, and social dynamics as well as company data, and suggested their potential impact on the capital markets and security values. This approach attempts to determine the expected return of an investment given a certain amount of financial risk including purchasing power risk, interest rate risk and business risk. It involves an in-depth study of the economy and its implications for industries and companies, valuation of security based on its future earning power and dividend paying expectations utilizing the valuation approaches. Both qualitative and quantitative (financial statements including the income statement and balance sheet) information and analyses are used for stock value estimation. The derived value of the stock is then compared with its current market value to determine whether to invest on this stock or not. In brief, fundamental analysis is suitable for long term forecasting and analysis. It could be used to predict the overall trend of movement in future.",

The technical approach is based on three assumptions: market action discounts everything; prices move in trend; and history repeats itself. The types of chart available include daily bar chart, long range weekly and monthly chart, shorter term intra-day chart, major reversal patterns like the head and shoulders pattern and the double top or bottom, moving averages, oscillators and contrary opinion, point and figure chart, etc. In short, technical analysis is mainly for short term forecasting while fundamental analysis is for long term prediction. The prototype MISMIS can handle both short term and long term depending on what data the user input into the system and the time frame for his/her prediction. For short term forecasting, a user may use the past historical stock price to predict the future stock price using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) or artificial neural network (ANN). For long term prospective, a user may predict the stock index movement by considering the underlying fundamental economic data using regression or ANN.",

For example, change in the monthly average of the spot price of crude oil per barrel, which is a stationary time series, is measured by differencing the monthly average of spot prices [21] . These changes of monthly average are helpful to predict the trend of the economic movement. Normalization -some financial data have a big difference in scale. For example, Hang Seng Index (HSI) ranges from 17,000 to 31,000 while deposit rate ranges from 0.00 to 0.05. If these data used directly, the indicators with large value, e.g. HSI, may dominate the prediction. Usually these data need to be normalized in same scale before analysis so as to have the same weighting for forecasting. All value will be in a range of 0-1 after normalization.

ANNs are also very effective in learning cases that contain noisy, incomplete or even contradictory data. The ability to learn and the capability to handle imprecise data make ANNs very suitable for handling financial and business information. However, a main limitation of ANNs is that they lack explanatory capabilities. ANNs do not provide users with reasons how particular conclusions are deducted. Past studies favor neural network in the sense it gives slightly better prediction accuracy [14, 18] . Moreover, increasingly people believe that finance market price movement is highly non-linear and dynamic [1, 4, 7] . Hence, the MISMIS encloses the above essential techniques.",

Once the testing result is not satisfactory, the model would be fine-tuned with different training heuristics. The process is iterative until a satisfactory model is built. Other than simply dividing data into two static portions, Jackknife or Window Shifting techniques may also be available in MISMIS for model training and testing. Different prediction models are generated in which each trial uses different portions of data for testing. In MISMIS, a user can easily reiterate the process by adjusting the training and testing data set; changing the prediction algorithm or adding/dropping factors for prediction.

As our models were on daily forecasts of HSI, for simplicity, the settlement of a call/put option need to be completed in the same day. We assumed a trader would put or call in the morning using the opening index and settle the transaction using the closing index in the same day. The financial return will be the product of HK$50 times the difference between the closing and opening indices. Whether it is a gain or loss is determined by the correctness of prediction direction. In the mean time, the transaction fee was taken into account. The performance outputs of the virtual trading in terms of the annualized returns and Sharpe ratios are shown in Table 2 .",

A small sample size was appropriate in this stance given the preliminary nature of the system [10, 16] . That is, the focus of the evaluation was not on its general usability but on its design and possible enhancement. This should also enable us to make sense beyond its design issues [22] . The interviews were not rigidly structured, that is a flexible approach was adopted when asking respondents questions. In this way, issues which arose during the interview could be explored in depth and respondents were encouraged to elaborate in order to enhance the richness of their answers [24, 31] . After a brief description of the research project, each interviewee was asked about the following two issues. Through the in-depth interviews, with each one around an hour, they all (six of them) agreed that MISMIS would be very useful to most individual investors. Four consultants also agreed that this package is easy to use. In terms of adopting this package in their workplace, while three consultants recommended that its launching would be through an e-banking platform, the other three consultants suggested a pilot trial within their firms. In the current situation of Hong Kong, most individual investors trades their stocks in banks, which offer an integrated service of deposits, equi-ty management and mortgages. Four of them perceived the most important barrier coming from the know-how of those sophisticated techniques. These four consultants said that they do not understand the prediction mechanism behind MISMIS. Thus, they suggested strengthening the MISMIS by adding more sample applications (e.g. trading of stocks, options, and warrants), a comprehensive on-line help facility, and some on-line training for those individual investors who are usually laymen on ARIMA, regression and neural network. Three respondents perceived some other practical difficulties while a bank launches the MISMIS. The database of the financial data will be a huge one and may not be easily maintainable. Two consultants puzzled that this application may generate a lot of Internet traffic and may demand for some intensive computing power in the servers of a bank. Nevertheless, they all (six of them) thought that it would a good move even a bank just put MISMIS on a trial basis for some selected customers.",

This approach is best suited to build a model that is complicated. The interactivity of the MISMIS enables users to know the prediction instantly. While building a complicated model using traditional approaches, it is very difficult to link up input and output variables. Moreover a complicated model is very difficult to diagnose when the prediction outcome is not satisfactory. By applying a multilevel and interactive approach, the complicated model can be broken down into some sub-models, which are much easy to analyze and the prediction model can be readjusted instantly.
