Interferoninduced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) is an ISG product that suppresses early stage infection by a number of viruses through an as yet unknown mechanism of action. Moreover, the actions of IFITM1 on HCV infection are not fully elucidated. Here we identify IFITM1 as a hepatocyte tight junction protein and a potent anti-HCV effector molecule. IFITM1 expression is induced early during IFN treatment of hepatocytes and accumulates at hepatic tight junctions in HCV-infected human patient liver during IFN therapy. Additionally, we found that IFITM1 interacts with HCV co-receptors including CD81 and occludin to disrupt the process of viral entry. Thus, IFITM1 is an anti-HCV ISG whose actions impart control of HCV infection through interruption of viral coreceptor function.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health problem with over 170 million people worldwide chronically infected (1) . HCV therapy has traditionally consisted of interferon alpha (IFN) and ribavirin. The newly approved protease inhibitors have improved sustained virologic response (SVR) rates but still require IFN in combination for optimal results and reduced development of viral resistance (2) . IFN treatment induces the expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). ISG products impart immunomodulatory, metabolic, apoptotic, and antiviral actions locally in the infected cell and systematically to bystander cells and immune effector cells, thus mediating antiviral states to suppress infection (3) . While the antiviral actions of IFN against HCV are likely mediated by a combination of ISGs acting on multiple viral and host targets, only a few ISGs have so far been defined to have anti-HCV properties (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Defining key ISG effectors and their mechanisms of action against HCV will allow for treatment modification to enhance the antiviral activity of IFN-based therapy toward improved SVR while also generating potential targets for novel antiviral therapy applications. IFN triggers ISG expression by binding the interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor and stimulating the Jak/ STAT signaling cascade leading to formation of the ISGF3 transcription factor complex and downstream induction of ISGs (11) . Different IFN subtypes bind the receptor with varying affinities, leading to different ISG induction profiles (12) . We previously showed that the synthetic consensus IFN, a consensus of multiple IFN-\u03b1 subtypes, has higher potency against HCV infection as compared to naturally occurring IFN-\u03b1 subtypes (13) . High throughput genomics analyses of hepatocytes treated with consensus IFN revealed that this increased potency is associated with the induction of a specific bioset of 86 ISGs, including IFITM1, thus linking IFITM1 to enhancement of IFN antiviral actions (13) .",

IFITM1 is induced by type I and type II interferons (17) , and has been suggested to mediate the anti-proliferative effects of type II interferon (18) . IFITM1 has been best characterized in the context of B cells in which it serves to reduce the threshold of B cell receptor engagement needed for cell stimulation in conjunction with interactions involving CD81 and the B cell receptor (19) . Since CD81 is an essential co-receptor for HCV (20) , these observations suggest that IFITM1 may impose restriction of HCV infection at the regulation of CD81 function.",

HCV is thought to bind heparin sulfate glycoaminoglycans and the LDL receptor at the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocyte as the virus passes through the bloodstream before interacting with the CD81 and SB-RI coreceptors, which are engaged by the viral E1/E2 glycoproteins (20) . Although claudin-1 is considered a tight junction molecule, its interactions with CD81 have been shown to occur at the sinusoidal membrane (21) . The hepatocyte tight junction is inaccessible to HCV directly in polarized cells (22) , and the mechanism by which HCV accesses co-receptors within the tight junction complex remains controversial. The complex orchestration of HCV coreceptors during HCV binding and entry suggests that dysregulation of the co-receptor interaction process offers a prime therapeutic strategy to suppress HCV infection.",

After 24 hours of IFN-\u03b1 therapy, high levels of IFITM1 induction in liver tissue from chronically infected patients strongly correlated with favorable therapeutic outcome of viral load suppression (Figure 1b) . The highest induction of IFITM1 was detected in patients with rapid virologic response to combination pegylated-IFN and ribavirin therapy (RVR: undetectable serum HCV RNA by week 4 of therapy), followed by those with early virologic responses (complete EVR (cEVR): undetectable serum HCV by week 12 of therapy; partial EVR (pEVR): greater than 2 log 10 IU/mL reduction in but not complete loss of HCV RNA by week 12 of therapy).

Confocal microscopy analysis of cultures transiently expressing N-terminally FLAG-tagged IFITM1 and subsequently infected with culture-adapted HCV (genotype 2A) revealed a \"virus exclusion\" phenotype, wherein HCV (as marked by viral protein presence) is effectively excluded from cells expressing IFITM1 but present in neighboring cells lacking IFITM1 expression (Figure 3a, top panel) . In contrast, IFITM1 expression in transfected Huh7-K2040 cells stably harboring an HCV subgenomic replicon did not exclude viral protein expression (Figure 3a , lower panel). Since IFITM1 blocks de novo HCV infection but has no detectable effect on the HCV replicon, our data indicate that IFITM1 primarily impacts the early stages of HCV infection. For more detailed analyses, we produced clonal Huh7 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged IFITM1 (Huh7-IFITM1 cells). IFITM1 expression in these cells is four-fold higher than in Huh7 cells treated with 100 IU/ mL IFN-\u03b2 for 24 hours (Supplemental Figure 1a) . Huh7-IFITM1 cells were subsequently infected with HCV and assessed for viral RNA accumulation. Constitutive IFITM1 expression in Huh7 cells associated with significantly reduced levels of HCV RNA in infected cultures as compared to Huh7 cells stably expressing FLAG vector alone (control) (Figure 3b ). This effect was also seen at the levels of viral protein accumulation ( Figure 3c ) and de novo infectious virus production ( Figure 3d ). The effect of IFITM1 was not due to defects in a single clone of IFITM1-expresing Huh7 cells, as a bulk population of Huh7-IFITM1 also demonstrates reduced HCV protein accumulation (Supplemental Figure 1b) . We next tested HCV focus formation on IFITM1-expressing cultures by confocal microscopy. As expected, IFITM1 expression limited the total number of HCV-infected foci (Supplemental Figure 1c) . Interestingly, for the foci that did form on Huh7-IFITM1 cells, fewer cells were infected per focus as compared to those in vector-control samples (Figures 3e,f). This result indicates that HCV is impaired in its ability to spread to neighboring cells in the presence of IFITM1. Together, these data confirm that IFITM1 is a potent IFNinduced inhibitor of HCV infection.",

Although our data do not formally exclude an effect of IFITM1 on HCV replication, they indicate that the primary effect is upstream at the level of binding and/or entry due to the lack of inhibition of HCV replicon. The known interaction of IFITM1 with the HCV coreceptor CD81 suggests that IFITM1 could alter the function of one or more HCV receptors and inhibit the entry process. We determined that pseudoparticles enveloped with HCV glycoproteins were significantly reduced in their ability to enter Huh7-IFITM1 as compared to Huh7-vector cells (Figure 4a ). In contrast, VSV and MLV pseudoparticles were not significantly reduced in the presence of IFITM1 (Figure 4a ). While this result indicates that IFITM1 reduces HCV entry, the effect is not as strong as expected by the earlier reduction of HCV infection itself. To more carefully examine HCV binding and entry, we tested each stage with actual infectious virus. To determine if IFITM1 inhibited HCV binding to or entry into host cells, Huh7 cells were incubated with HCV virions at 4\u00b0C and thereafter unbound virus was washed away. HCV RNA collected at this point represents HCV bound to the cell surface (26) . After virus binding, cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C to allow HCV entry to proceed. After 4 hours the HCV virions that remained on the cell surface were stripped off by proteinase K treatment of cells, and therefore the HCV RNA collected at this point represents only cell-internalized virus. As a negative control of virus binding and entry, we included a parallel assessment of cells treated with neutralizing anti-CD81 antibody (27) . Expression of IFITM1 did not significantly reduce HCV binding, which remained stable and above the levels of virus binding after anti-CD81 treatment. Thus, IFITM1 does not function to block CD81-dependent binding of HCV to target cells ( Figure  4b) . Importantly, we found that HCV entry was blocked by ectopic IFITM1 expression to a level similar to the blockade imposed by treatment with anti-CD81 antibody (Figure 4b) .",

These immunoprecipitations were performed using equivalent amounts of protein lysates in CHAPS buffer, which has been demonstrated to preserve CD81 interactions with associated proteins (28) . We have experimentally determined that these conditions lead to consistent and specific immunoprecipitation reactions.

This process could include an IFITM1-mediated disruption of the essential CD81 association with other HCV co-receptors. To determine how IFITM1 impacts one such CD81 interaction, we conducted anti-CD81 immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analyses in the presence or absence of ectopic IFITM1. Surprisingly, expression of IFITM1 led to a redistribution of CD81 into occludin-containing complexes (Figure 5b) . Moreover, we found that IFITM1 promoted the association of CD81 with ZO-1. This result indicates that IFITM1 enhances the association of CD81 with a complex typically associated with tight junctions in polarized cells. We also discovered that IFN treatment of cultured cells resulted in an increased association of CD81 with occludin ( Figure 5b ). The enhancement of CD81/ occludin binding was dependent on IFITM1 expression since both basal and IFN-induced CD81-occludin associations were reduced in IFITM1-shRNA knockdown cells (Figure 5b) . Importantly, the enhanced association of CD81 with the this complex was independent of HCV infection, as IFITM1 expression induced exogenously or by IFN treatment produced this phenotype in the absence of infection. Thus, IFITM1 expression stimulates CD81 redistribution and a stable association between CD81 and occludin during the IFN response. Alteration of CD81 associations in non-infected cells suggests that IFITM1 might disrupt the process of HCV infection through altered co-receptor function.",

We found that IFITM1 was distributed in liver tissue in a pattern consistent with hepatic tight junction localization and fully overlapped with the tight junction marker ZO-1.

Colocalization was confirmed by 3-D reconstruction of confocal images (Figure 6c ), demonstrating full overlap of IFITM1 with ZO-1 and occludin.

            "text": "The IFITM family has been shown to impose antiviral actions against a number of viruses, including influenza A virus, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus and HIV (14) (15) 34) . While these studies also showed that each of these viruses are restricted by IFITM1 at early stages of infection, the viruses studied do not share major viral entry receptors with HCV, nor are they known to involve tight junctions in their entry processes. This raises the question as to how IFITM1 exerts its antiviral function against different viruses. Notably, tetraspanins including CD81 have been shown to regulate HIV-induced cell fusion, and CD81 was recently identified to be necessary for optimal entry by influenza A virus (35) (36) (37) . These reports thus identify a common thread of at least three viruses known to be inhibited by IFITM1 through a class of molecules known to include IFITM1-interacting partners (28) . Tetraspanins have been demonstrated to regulate fusion of a number of additional viruses (38) , so it is likely that other IFITM1-regulated viruses utilize tetraspanins to regulate viral entry. Our finding that IFITM1 inhibits HCV entry is in contrast to a recent publication that showed that IFITM1 was unable to inhibit cellular entry by HCV pseudoparticles, yet it reduced viral replication (16) . This discrepancy is likely due to lower sensitivity of the HCV pseudoparticle system, as demonstrated in Figure 4 . We were also unable to recapitulate the authors' reported effect of IFITM1 on HCV replication. This can in part be explained by a recent siRNA screen in which IFITM1 siRNA enhances HCV replication in the context of IFN treatment, but IFITM1 overexpression alone had no significant effect (10) . We propose that IFITM1 might in part affect HCV replication, but that the primary effect occurs at the level of viral entry, as in the case of other viruses studied. Another interesting component of antiviral activity of IFITM1 would be that against other viruses know to utilize the tight junction during their entry processes, such as coxsackie virus (39) . Our data thus far are not sufficient to make informed hypotheses about these viruses. One could propose that IFITM1 alters complexes involved in tight junctions and may affect these other viruses, or that there may be no effect on other viruses if they do not require affected coreceptors such as CD81 or occludin.",

This was also previously demonstrated for HIV, where the virus was able to bind host cells and enter endosomal compartments, but was not released into the cytoplasm in the presence of IFITM1 (15) . As CD81 is known to regulate host and viral membrane fusions (38) , its complex redistribution in the presence of IFITM1 may alter the CD81-mediated regulation of viral fusion and subsequent entry into host cells. The primary role of tetraspanins such as CD81 appears to be the organization of membrane complex formation (38) , an essential process in viral entry into host cells and a likely target of IFITM1-mediated viral disruption. The tight junction localization of IFITM1 provides new insights into the cellular functions of this molecule.
