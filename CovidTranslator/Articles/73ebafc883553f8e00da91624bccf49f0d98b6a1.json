Understanding its burden, as an emerging infectious disease, is vital for devising appropriate control strategies. In this study, the burden of MERS-CoV was estimated over 31 months period from June 6, 2012 to January 5, 2015. The total number of patients was 835; 528 (63.2%) patients were male, 771 (92.3%) patients were \u226525 years of age, and 210 (25.1%) patients were healthcare workers. A total of 751 (89.9%) patients required hospitalization. The median duration between onset of illness and hospitalization was 2 days (interquartile range, 0-5). The median length of hospital stay was 14 days (IQR, 6-27). The overall case fatality rate was 43.1%. Basic reproductive number was 0.9. Being Saudi, non-healthcare workers, and age \u226565 years were significantly associated with higher mortality. In conclusion, MERS-CoV infection caused a substantial health burden in Saudi Arabia.",

It is believed that most infected persons do not show symptoms as indicated by a seroprevalence survey that estimated the number of seropositive people in Saudi Arabia to be nearly 45,000 persons [3] . The case fatality rate among clinical cases has been estimated to be 40% [4] .

When R 0 is <1, the infection will die out in the long run, whereas, if R 0 is > 1, the infection will be able to spread in a population. Generally, the larger the value of R 0 , the harder it is to control the epidemic. The basic reproductive number in our study was 0.9 which indicated that each case would on average lead to less than one additional case and that transmission of this infection will eventually stop if there was no external re-infection. The continually reported MERS-CoV cases with occasional clusters observed in Saudi Arabia despite the low R 0 is likely due to repeated external re-introduction of the virus from camels.",

This possible seasonal increase of human MERS-CoV cases corresponds to the end of the calving season (December-February) for camels in Saudi Arabia [30, 31] . It also corresponds to the weaning season when camels are weaned of milk at 12-16 months of age. A recent prospective study showed that MERS-CoV detection by RT-PCR in dromedary camels was more common in the period between November and January, corresponding to the camels' calving season [32] . Several studies also showed that MERS-CoV RNA shedding is more common in juvenile than in adult camels [31] [32] [33] [34] . Therefore, juvenile camels younger than 2 years of age are likely to be an important source of new MERS-CoV infections in camels and humans leading to higher incidence of human infection during the period between March and May [31, 33, 34] .",

There was an exponential increase in CFR after age 55. Patients \u226565 years of age had the highest risk of mortality with OR of 35.6 (95% CI = 9.6-132.3). Males had 1.4 times higher case fatality compared to females but this was not statistically significant. A higher risk of mortality was also noticed among Saudi cases compared to non-Saudis (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.0-2.6). Non\u2212HCW had significantly higher mortality rate compared to HCWs (OR = 5.4 95% CI = 2.9-10.1). Multiple logistic regression showed that being Saudi, non-healthcare workers, and \u226565 years of age were significantly associated with higher CFR. Unlike the related SARS coronavirus, the MERS-CoV is associated with a relatively higher CFR (>30%) and noticeable age and sex differences among confirmed cases [12] . The male to female ratio among confirmed cases of MRES-CoV is reported to be 2:1, with highest rates of morbidity and mortality occurring among patients \u226550 years of age [12] . The significantly lower mortality rate observed among HCWs in comparison with non\u2212HCWs is likely due to earlier presentation (2 vs 3 days, respectively), younger age (38.9 vs 52.7 years, respectively), and lower risk of having comorbidities.",
