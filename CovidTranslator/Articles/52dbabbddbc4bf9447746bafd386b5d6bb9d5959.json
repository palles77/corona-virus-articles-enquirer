At least one positive sample was detected on 74 of the farms (92.5%) by IFAT microscopy. The prevalence in cattle was 10.2% (95% CI 9.4-11.1%), with greater prevalences detected in calf samples, especially from those under 1 month (45.1%). Young calves were also more likely to be shedding Cryptosporidium parvum and larger concentrations of oocysts, whereas older calves and adult cattle were more likely to be shedding Cryptosporidium bovis and Cryptosporidium andersoni, respectively. The C. parvum subtypes detected were predominantly from types commonly identified in UK cattle (67% were either IIaA15G2R1 or IIaA17G1R1). A novel subtype, IIaA17G1R2, was identified from one cattle sample.",

The contributions of wild animal and bird populations to the environmental load were also investigated. Molecular tools were used, capable of determining all species of Cryptosporidium, to determine the extent of the presence of different species on the farms, and subtyping tools were used to further discriminate those of primary zoonotic importance and assess the potential transmission risk to people and farm animals. The identification of Cryptosporidium species of veterinary importance was considered essential as, although some may not be a risk to public health, infection in calves adversely affects farm productivity. This study aimed to inform the development of interventions that would be of use to the farmer in disrupting transmission routes or potential reservoirs of infection, while also helping to determine areas of greatest risk to the public entering farm land for recreational purposes.",

Samples represented the risk of infection from a particular wildlife species, such as birds, foxes, deer and rodents (counting birds as a single species) in a particular house or field where calf samples had been collected. As much faecal material as possible, pooled from the same location and the same species, was collected in each sample pot. Pre-moistened, sterile Readiwipes were used to collect bird samples. (2) Co-grazing sheep (maximum. 10 samples). Fresh (voided) faeces were collected from sheep that were co-grazed with cattle. If sheep were co-grazed on more than one field, then the 10 samples were divided between the fields roughly in proportion to the size of the sheep groups in each. If no co-grazed sheep were present then no samples were collected. (3) Manure (maximum. 2 pooled samples). Samples were taken from two composting/stacked manure heaps to which calves and youngstock had most recently contributed. At four separate locations on the heap, surface weathered manure was pulled away and then material removed to a depth of 10-20 cm. Two \"pinches\" (approx. 4 g) of manure were collected per hole, with a final pinch of surface material. If the farm had only one heap, a second pooled sample was not required. (4) Dirty water (maximum 3 samples). Sampling areas were the milking parlour drain, outside drain that contributes to the farm's dirty water and drains in areas of animal accommodation or collecting yard. The liquid in the drain was mixed well using a plastic rod. The rod was wiped with 70% ethanol and thoroughly rinsed with water between successive samples and a new rod used for each farm. Up to 1 L of drain liquid was collected. (5) Spread slurry (maximum. 5 samples). Five sampling areas were identified (e.g. top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right and centre) in a pasture field used for grazing where slurry had been spread in the last month. If more than one pasture field had been spread in the past month, then the most recently spread field was selected. The areas of the pasture field selected for sampling were preferably damp, shaded areas where slurry had been visibly spread. From each of the 5 areas, a 2 m \u00d7 2 m section was selected and a sample (approximately 5 g) of residual manure or surface material (topsoil or visually contaminated grass) was collected from 10 points in the section, by scraping to a depth of no more than 2.5 cm.

The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in cattle was low overall but was high in young calves, especially those under one month of age. A trend of decreasing prevalence with increasing age of the cattle was observed. Another study in the same area showed a prevalence rate of 28% in young calves at any one time (Brook et al., 2008) which is lower than seen in other EU countries where 47.9% prevalence rates have been reported in beef and dairy calves under 22 days of age (Castro Hermida et al., 2002) . The risk to people from young calves is higher as young calves were also more likely to be shedding C. parvum which is the species responsible for up to 50% of human cases (Chalmers et al., 2009) , and young calves were found to be shedding larger concentrations of oocysts in the faeces samples. However, if the calves are housed indoors then the risk is predominantly to the handlers rather than the general public. Older calves and adult cattle were more likely to be shedding C. bovis and C. andersoni, respectively, for which the public health/zoonotic risk is low, although there is still a risk from those older calves and cattle shedding C. parvum. However, there is a possibility that a proportion of C. bovis results may have been Cryptosporidium Xiao as only circa 20% were confirmed by sequencing.",

US and European studies have shown that the cross-sectional prevalence rate in ewes was 25% and in lambs was between 59% and 77% (Causap\u00e9 et al., 2002; Sant\u00edn et al., 2007) . However, in a longitudinal study on a single UK farm, the rates were shown to be 6.4% in ewes and 12.9% in lambs (Sturdee et al., 2003) . When assessing the prevalence rate detected in this study, consideration must be given to the lack of epidemiological data collected for the sheep samples (i.e. no ages were supplied), which may account for the prevalence being lower than expected. The detection of C. bovis in sheep was not unexpected, as it has been found in previous studies of both mixed sheep/cattle farms and sheep only farms (Mueller-Doblies et al., 2008) .",

The rodent samples had a high prevalence and had large concentrations of oocysts in the samples, although the Cryptosporidium species detected were not a known zoonosis risk and so rodent faeces may be of a lower risk to people. The high prevalence agrees with a longitudinal study completed on a single UK farm which showed the prevalence in small wild mammals (mainly rodents) living in and around farm buildings as 32.8% and living in areas of pasture as 29.9% (Sturdee et al., 2003) . Mice have also been shown to be potential vectors of Cryptosporidium in other studies (Klesius et al., 1986) and the identification of C. andersoni in the mouse sample, confirmed by ABI sequencing (100% match to all sequenced C. andersoni), may also provide evidence that rodent faeces could be a source of infection to cattle. In the bird samples, a subtype of C. parvum known to be detected in human populations was found and birds may help spread infection to different buildings (potentially shown by the subtyping results detected in this study) and to other farms, and areas contaminated with their faeces may also pose a risk to people.",

Cryptosporidium was found in dirty water and manure sources, and was also detected in some pasture samples where slurry had been spread. C. parvum was detected in dirty water and manure samples, and although C. parvum was not detected in a small number of microscopy-positive soil samples, the presence of a Cryptosporidium species detected in the cattle on the farm shows that this transmission route may be a risk to people who have contact with pasture. However, we are unable to state whether all Cryptosporidium positive waste samples were viable. Due to the larger quantities of farm waste that would generally be produced by adult cattle rather than calves, it is interesting that it was the Cryptosporidium species rarely found in adults that was mostly detected in the waste. Soil can be difficult to process using molecular techniques as it may contain inhibitory factors, although it has been shown that up to 17% of 782 soil samples taken from dairy farms in the USA contain Cryptosporidium oocysts (Barwick et al., 2003) . This environmental risk is particularly important in England and Wales, where the public have greater access to farm land than in many other countries (Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000). It is interesting that the number of human cases from contact with recreational water is increasing (Yoder et al., 2012) and this may be related to run off from waste contaminating waterways. It may reasonably be concluded that muck heap management and slurry management prior to spreading can be considered an intervention point to reduce environmental contamination with benefits to both veterinary and public health.",

Interestingly, there was no specific contact (e.g. nose-to-nose contact) recorded that was different between groups with matching species and either non-matching groups on that same farm or on other farms, although sharing staff between groups appeared to increase the risk.
