The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted. With this approach the lack of data due to the still ongoing Italian epidemic was compensated by the Chinese experience, allowing to obtain a SIRD model for this relatively new COVID-19 outbreak. According to the modeling prediction the peak of infection should be on the 28 th of March, with almost 42,000 infected people.",

COVID-19 symptoms are often (80%) mild [2] , may appear 2-14 days after exposure (mean incubation period 5-6 days) [2] , and include fever, cough and shortness of breath [3] . However the 13.8% of infected have severe disease and the 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure) [2] . Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks [2] . In the severe and critical disease, the patient admission to intensive care unit (ICU) is necessary and the mechanical ventilation (artificial assistance to support breathing), may be required [4] . This special treatment is the bottle neck of most of the health care systems, which are not prepared to deal with the numbers of patients that the COVID-19 disease could produce. Therefore, measures of containment of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are essential to not overstress the health care systems and to manage the pandemic.",

Epidemiologic descriptions and predictions could help in the understanding of the dynamic of the COVID-19 disease, supporting governments and health authorities in the resources allocation [5] . Most of the models proposed until now to describe the COVID-19 outbreaks, due to the scarcely data available of a still ongoing epidemic, are heuristic models. These models are \"fitting\" equation, exponential [5] or logistic [6] , used to describe the infection data, whose parameters have scarce (or none) physical meaning and their use for prediction, especially at long term, should be avoided. On the contrary compartmental models could constitute the right trad-off between the need of having physical based parameters, the easiness of solution and the scarce presence of data in the evolving epidemic. Typically, the population of interest is subdivided into a small number of compartments based on infection status (e.g. susceptible, infectious or recovered) and the flows between these compartments are described by ordinary differential equations [7] . Aim of this work is to develop a compartmental model (SIRD) to describe first the Chinese COVID-19 epidemic and then, by perturbation of the model parameters, to describe and predict the Italian COVID-19 epidemic.",

This unexpected result can be explained considering that the treatments were improved as well as considering a parameter not directly accounted in this model: the relation between lethality and patience age [11] . Indeed the \"quarantine\" measures may be particular effective for old people (>60 years) and for people with more comorbidities, who form the group of patients in which the COVID-19 lethality is the highest.

According to the model prediction the peak is expected between the end of March and the beginning of April (28 th of March precisely) with almost 42,000 infected people. According to the data reported in [2] , if the 6% of patients will require an admission to the intensive care unit, the number of beds in those units should be around 2500 (in accordance with [5] ) which is almost half of the total availability [5] . It is interesting to note that despite the same characteristic time of infection and the delay in the government restrictive measures, the peak is expected before April 11 th (one month after the lockdown). This is because, as it can be seen from the Chinese and Italian infection kinetics, the \"force of infection\" is lower in Italy, which could be explained considering that the mains outbreaks in Italy have been developed in small cities, whereas in the Hubei province the principal outbreak was in the metropolitan city of Wuhan (11 million of people). It has also to be said that the peak is anticipated because of a greater lethality, that removes at higher rate (almost the double with the respect to the Chinese outbreak) patients from the infected compartment. Higher lethality, which is estimated by the model to be around the 11%, reflects also on the total number of death people at the end of the outbreak that, sadly, should be close to 10,000. The D-curve in Figure 4 is of course a sigma-shaped one, and it can be of interest to fit the experimental data by a proper equation, in order to provide easy estimate of proximal behavior. It is disputed if the D-curve has to obey the Logistic behavior (Logistic is the analytic solution for constant-parameter SIS model), or something different (e.g. Gompertz curve). The fit of the model calculation given in Figure 4 is in favor of the use of Gompertz equation as a descriptive tool. The higher lethality could be due to the higher median age of the Italian population (44.3 years) with respect to the Chinese population (37.4 years) [12] . However further studies should be performed to investigate such a high lethality, i.e. in [13] it is suggested that the reasons could be found in the Italian extensive intergenerational contacts, which are supported by a high degree of residential proximity between adult children and their parents. Regarding the recovered people, it has to be said that Italy had an initial higher recovery kinetic, probably due to the experience and treatments inherited from the Chinese case. At the end of the Italian epidemic the model estimates that the 0.136% of the Italian population will be interested by the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11 th of March declared a global pandemic. Despite in most of the cases (80%) COVID-19 presents mild symptoms, in some cases the admission to intensive care units (ICU) and the use of mechanical ventilation are necessary. These types of \"special treatments\" are limited and an uncontrolled COVID-19 epidemic could easily overwhelm any health care system. In order to contain the outbreaks that are being developing in the whole globe, the governments are taking drastic measures, locking down whole nations. The understanding of the dynamic of the epidemic could be useful to take decisions in time, preparing hospitals to deal with the infection peak. The ongoing outbreaks are often described with simple fitting models, i.e. exponential functions functions (and/or sigma-shaped curves such as Logistic or Gompertz, this last being the one to be preferably used to fit the data), however in this work, exploiting the similarity between the almost extinguished Chinese epidemic and the relatively new Italian epidemic, a SIRD compartmental model was developed and used to describe and predict the evolution of both the outbreaks. The advantages of SIRD models with respect to heuristic models reside mainly in the physical-based SIRD parameters, which can give useful insight and/or can be properly chosen on the basis of physical-based assumptions. The present SIRD model was able to describe the Chinese outbreak, obtaining the kinetic of infection, the kinetic of recovery as well as the kinetic of death. Several modeling parameters obtained from the fitting of the Chinese epidemic were used without further modification for the Italian outbreak, considering the similarity of actions taken by the governments. Instead the best fit kinetic of infection in Italy was lower than the Chinese infection, probably because the Italian outbreaks are mainly based in small hospitals/cities, whereas the main Chinese outbreak was in the metropolitan city of Wuhan. The Italian epidemic showed instead a higher death kinetic, causing at the end of infection three times the Chinese death (modeling results). In conclusion the developed SIRD model predicts for the Italian epidemic the infection peak between the end of March and the beginning of April 2020, with almost 42,000 people infected at the same time and a number of death people at the end of the epidemic of about 10,000.",
