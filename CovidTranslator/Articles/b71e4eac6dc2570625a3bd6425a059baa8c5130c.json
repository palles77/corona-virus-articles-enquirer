Methods: We modeled a generic disease caused by a pathogen apparently transmitted by close interpersonal contact, but about which little else is known. In our model, people may be infectious while incubating or during their prodrome or acute illness. We derived an expression for <, the reproduction number, took its partial derivatives with respect to control parameters, and encoded these analytical results in a user-friendly Mathematica TM notebook. With biological parameters for SARS estimated from the initial case series in Hong Kong and infection rates from hospitalizations in Singapore, we determined <'s sensitivity to control parameters. Results: Stage-specific infection rate estimates from cases hospitalized before quarantine began exceed those from the entire outbreak, but are qualitatively similar: infectiousness was negligible until symptom onset, and increased 10-fold from prodrome to acute illness. Given such information, authorities might instead have emphasized a strategy whose efficiency more than compensates for any possible reduction in efficacy. Conclusions: In future outbreaks of new human diseases transmitted via close interpersonal contact, it should be possible to identify the optimal intervention early enough to facilitate effective decision-making.",

On returning home to Singapore, Taiwan, Toronto, and Vietnam, they transmitted the pathogen causing the disease, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to local residents. Global spread of this hitherto unknown pathogen led WHO to issue travel advisories and some national health authorities to quarantine travelers from affected areas. As subsequent infections were largely nosocomial, hospital infection-control procedures were increasingly enforced. Absent knowledge of the onset of infectiousness, local authorities also quarantined community contacts.",

Isolating people with symptoms that may herald disease, especially if they might have been exposed to someone since diagnosed, would be more efficient. Impact is proportional to the product of efficiency and efficacy, which must exceed 1 \u00c0 1=< 0 for control, where < 0 is the average number of sufficiently intimate contacts for transmission while infectious.

But modeling enables one to calculate final outbreak sizes with and without interventions conditional on others (i.e., to relax both assumptions). Moreover, 116 possible contacts per probable case were restricted to their homes in Taiwan, 316 including travelers (Hsieh et al., 2005) . In Singapore and Beijing, 38 and 13 contacts per probable case were restricted, respectively (Tan, 2005; Pang et al., 2003) .

When s is large, moreover, the expected remaining sojourn can be as small as T/n. Hence, time remaining depends on time already spent. The gamma distribution [p n (s) for nX2] thus provides a more realistic description of disease natural history than the exponential [p 1 (s), for which M 1 (s) \u00bc T for all s]. Feng et al. (2007) derived a system of ordinary differential equations from a general integral equation model suitable for evaluating quarantine and isolation by replacing the exponential with the gamma distribution. Our model resembles theirs (Fig. 1 ), but we distinguish the prodrome and acute respiratory phase and allow infected people to become infectious before or after becoming ill, at rates-products of contact rates and probabilities of transmission on contact-that may differ among stages. Thirty-two suspect SARS patients were reclassified as probable post-discharge by virtue of laboratory test results, but we do not know how many secondary infections they caused.",

If patients could be infectious before developing symptoms, quarantine must be considered. But identifying people whose contacts were sufficiently intimate for infection is extremely difficult, especially given uncertainty about the mode of transmission. The gain in efficiency-by ensuring instead that people with early signs and symptoms seek medical care, clinicians diagnose, and infectioncontrol personnel isolate them effectively-may more than compensate for any loss of efficacy due to infections during the prodrome. Modeling can help to determine this distribution and, conditional on that essential information, to evaluate the relative impact of various possible public health interventions.",
