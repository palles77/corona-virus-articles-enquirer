Host-directed therapy (HDT) is an emerging approach in the field of anti-infectives. The strategy behind HDT is to interfere with host cell factors that are required by a pathogen for replication or persistence, to enhance protective immune responses against a pathogen, to reduce exacerbated inflammation and to balance immune reactivity at sites of pathology. Although HDTs encompassing interferons are well established for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis, novel strategies aimed at the functional cure of persistent viral infections and the development of broad-spectrum antivirals against emerging viruses seem to be crucial. In chronic bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis, HDT strategies aim to enhance the antimicrobial activities of phagocytes and to curtail inflammation through interference with soluble factors (such as eicosanoids and cytokines) or cellular factors (such as co-stimulatory molecules). This Review describes current progress in the development of HDTs for viral and bacterial infections, including sepsis, and the challenges in bringing these new approaches to the clinic.

Antibiotics have contributed to a profound reduction in disease incidence caused by bacterial pathogens, but we increasingly face antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to these antibiotics, and the development of new antibacterials lags behind the emergence of resistance. In 2015, an estimated 700,000 deaths were caused by pathogens with antimicrobial resistance 1 Persistent viral infections can only rarely be cured, and major epidemics and pandemics such as those caused by the Ebola virus or Zika virus underscore our need for broadly active antivirals. Moreover, available antivirals are often limited by the rapid emergence of drug resistance. Approximately 90 new antiviral drugs have been approved in the past 50 years, and 29 of these have been approved in the past 6 years, mostly for the selective treatment of infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV 2 . There is a clear rise in R&D of antiviral drugs, but in contrast to antibiotics, their activity spectrum is mostly limited to a distinct virus group. For many viruses, particularly those that are highly prevalent in developing countries -including hepatitis and flaviviruses -such drugs are not available. Moreover, the constant emergence of infections with new virus species and the increasing incidences of outbreaks of viral diseases with pandemic potential emphasize the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.",

One such complementing strategy is host-directed therapy (HDT) with biologics or small molecules. HDT can: interfere with host mechanisms that are required by a pathogen for productive replication or persistence; enhance the immune response by stimulating mechanisms that are involved in host defence against the pathogen; target pathways that are perturbed by a pathogen and contribute to hyper-inflammation; and modulate host factors that lead to dysbalanced responses at the site of pathology. In the case of targeting hyper-inflammation and dysbalanced responses, treatment is symptomatic rather than causal, but reduces exacerbated tissue damage in infectious diseases and confines microbial niches.

Principally, these host factors are evolutionarily conserved, and therefore, successful evasion requires considerable mutational changes in the pathogen. Nevertheless, most HDT approaches are not considered to be stand-alone therapies but are combined with canonical anti-infectives. In this Review, we compare different HDT approaches for viral and bacterial infections and describe the progress made in their development, focusing mostly on tuberculosis (TB) (BOX 1) and sepsis for bacterial infections and on chronic viral hepatitis and AIDS for viral infections (TABLE 1) . We also provide deeper insights into the general principles underlying different diseases and note commonalities and differences between HDTs for distinct infections. Owing to space limitations and recently published reviews on the topic 3,4 , prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines are not covered here and only a few examples are mentioned (Supplementary information S1 (table)) .",

Entry of this virus requires the interaction between the primary receptor CD4 and one of two chemokine receptors that act as co-receptors: CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4; X4) and CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5; R5) 5 (FIG. 1) . Whereas CXCR4 is expressed on T cells and promotes the entry of T cell-tropic HIV-1 (X4-strains), CCR5 is expressed on macro phages and some populations of T cells and promotes the entry of macrophage-tropic HIV-1 (R5 strains). Intriguingly, individuals with certain mutations in CCR5 are resistant to infection with R5 strains, which predominate during the early stages of infection, whereas X4-tropic strains emerge during the later stages of infection 6 -thus qualifying CCR5 as an attractive target for HDTs 6 . Antagonists of CCR5 have been developed 7 that lock the receptor into a nonpermissive conformation and thereby dampen its coreceptor function. This concept, which was originally established in vitro, has been translated into clinical use, and Maraviroc (Selzentry/Celsentri; Pfizer) was approved as a first-in-class CCR5 inhibitor in 2007. As expected for an HDT, resistance to Maraviroc is low, and given the importance of CCR5 in HIV infection Maraviroc has become a component of HIV-1 therapy 8 . Apart from its virological benefit, Maraviroc has also been found to increase the number of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in some patients, suggesting that it has an additional these results, clinical trials have been conducted and have demonstrated the excellent tolerability of even high doses of myrcludex B 13 . Moreover, a phase Ib/IIa clinical trial of myrcludex B as a monotherapy in patients with chronic HBV-HDV co-infection revealed a strong reduction of HDV RNA serum levels and the normalization of liver enzymes (markers of liver cell damage). There was also a synergistic antiviral effect on HDV and HBV levels in patients treated with a combination of myrcludex B and polyethylene glycol-conjugated (pegylated) interferon \u03b12a (PegIFN\u03b12a) 14 . Myrcludex B received orphan drug status from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and further clinical trials are ongoing.",

Each granuloma follows a unique trajectory as a result of dynamic interactions between bacterial factors and host immunity.

The occurrence of drug-resistant TB is attributed to poor patient compliance with chemotherapy, which generally comprises four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide) and lasts for 6 months. In addition to poor compliance, genetic diversity and clonality of Mtb within patients 265 , as well as reduced drug penetration into lesions, can lead to monotherapy at sites of bacterial residence despite treatment with several drugs 185, 250 , which further contributes to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in TB. Equally alarming is the fast acquisition of resistance to the newly approved drugs for MDR TB, delamanid and bedaquiline 266 . Therefore, the development of AMR along with limited treatment options against MDR TB and XDR TB call for host-directed therapy primarily in adjunct to canonical chemotherapy.",

However, the CypA-CsA complex inhibits the protein phosphatase calcineurin, which is required for T cell activation, thus causing an immuno suppressive effect. Therefore, non-immunosuppressive Cyp antagonists, which are mostly derived from CsA, have been designed, including alisporivir (previously known as Debio 025), NIM811 and SCY-635. Although phase I and phase II clinical trials conducted with alisporivir and SCY-635 have demonstrated the inhibition of HCV across different genotypes and a high genetic barrier to resistance 19, 20 , further clinical development of these compounds was not pursued, presumably due to the very rapid development of direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) for HCV. However, CypA is a host cell factor used by viruses from different families, such as coronaviruses 21 and HIV 22 , suggesting that CypA antagonists have the potential to be developed into broad-spectrum antivirals. Although natural preexisting mutations in the HIV capsid protein, the CypA interaction partner, would limit the broad clinical use of this compound class, CypA-knockout mice and human cells are fully viable 23, 24 , and therefore possible toxicity associated with CypA inhibition should be low.",

This miRNA is preferentially expressed in hepatocytes, the primary host cells of HCV, and regulates lipid metabolism, but also binds to several regions of the HCV genome, most notably two regions close to the 5\u0374 end, and stimulates RNA replication 25 . Soon after the discovery of miR-122 as an HDF of HCV, antisense-based oligonucleotide approaches (known as antagomirs) were developed to sequester miR-122 in infected cells, thereby blunting HCV replication. This approach was well tolerated both in vitro and in vivo and imposed a high genetic barrier to resistance 26, 27 . However, studies with miR-122-knockout mice identified this miRNA as a tumour suppressor 28, 29 , which raised concerns about its inhibition. Moreover, given the challenges in the delivery of miR-122-specific antagomirs, to the best of our knowledge only one clinical candidate, RG-101 (Regulus Therapeutics) which is an N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated oligonucleotide that antagonizes miR-122 and that is targeted to hepatocytes, is being pursued in combination with different approved or investigational DAAs 30 .",

            "text": "Innate immune responses comprise cells and mechanisms that are continuously present or that are activated within minutes or hours after infection to suppress the replication and spread of the invading pathogen. In addition, the innate immune response provides important support for the (long-lasting) adaptive, humoral and cellular immune response. These functions are brought about by the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, which is frequently mediated by chemokines and cytokines, by the presentation of pathogen-specific antigens, the recognition and removal of pathogens by specialized white blood cells and the activation of the complement system. Although all of these mechanisms are relevant in viral infections, for host-directed therapy (HDT), distinct cytokines, the interferons (IFNs), are the best studied 54 . More than 20 IFN genes have been identified and they are grouped into three classes: type I IFNs which include IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2; the type II IFN\u03b3 that is produced by activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells; and type III IFNs or IFN\u03bbs that target mucosal epithelial cells and the liver 58 . Upon binding to their cognate receptor, these cytokines induce a signalling cascade that leads to the activation of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). On the one hand, ISGs enhance adaptive immunity -for example, by upregulating major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and thus antigen presentation -on the other hand, many of these genes contribute, directly or indirectly, to the antiviral state of a cell 54 . As a net result, IFN-treated cells are barely able to be infected by viruses, a property that is reflected in the name of these cytokines (interference). The inhibition of virus infection and replication is mediated in many ways, including through a shut-down of RNA translation, enhanced RNA degradation or cell growth arrest. In addition, several ISGs have a more direct antiviral effect, such as bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2; also known as tetherin), a transmembrane protein that resides on the cell surface and that interacts with the envelope of virus, such as HIV, thus tethering virus particles on the plasma membrane and preventing their release from the infected cell 259 . The type II IFN\u03b3 is crucial for defence against intracellular bacteria and protozoa.",

However, this area of research has been somewhat neglected, and the role of IFNs in controlling HIV infection has only recently received increasing attention 69 . For example, the administration of IFN\u03b12a in the rhesus macaque model before and after infection with a pathogenic strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) prevented systemic infection, but continued IFN\u03b12a treatment dampened the host IFN response, concomitant with reduced antiviral gene expression 70 . In addition, blocking the type I IFN receptor reduced antiviral gene expression, enhanced SIV replication, and spread and accelerated CD4 + IFN\u03bb1aT cell loss 70 . Interestingly, a phase II clinical trial of PegIFN\u03b12a in patients infected with HIV-1 revealed a significant, albeit moderate, reduction of plasma viral load after 12 weeks of treatment 71 . These observations suggest that the administration of supraphysiological levels of IFN to patients infected with HIV-1 can help to control virus replication. However, HIV-1 has developed numerous strategies to avoid detection by pattern recognition receptors and to block IFN-induced restriction factors, thus limiting the anti-HIV activity of IFN\u03b1 69 . Moreover, increased IFN\u03b1 activity seems to contribute to immune activation and immune dysfunction in HIV-positive patients. Therefore, dampening IFN\u03b1 production, although it may have detrimental effects on suppressing HIV replication, might reduce immune activation and thus the severity of disease.",

Different strategies are currently being pursued to tackle these challenges, including a 'shock and kill' approach, in which latent HIV-1 is reactivated in T cells to allow the killing of these cells through immune effector functions 76 . One example is the stimulation of the RIG-I pathway by the approved retinoic acid derivative acitretin. This treatment activates HIV transcription and RIG-I expression, which in turn senses HIV RNA, thus mounting an IFN response and preferentially inducing the apoptosis of HIV-infected cells 77 . Although early clinical studies with drugs such as acitretin that trigger the transcription of the proviral genome have raised hopes that this strategy can be used to reverse HIV-1 latency, the extent to which this strategy can reduce the viral reservoir size remains to be determined.",

IFN\u03b3 promotes phagosome maturation and autophagy, TNF augments responsiveness to IFN\u03b3 and upregulates ROS-mediated killing, and IL-1 increases AMP synthesis, upregulates TNF receptor (TNFR) expression and restricts the production of type I IFN, which is primarily antagonistic in TB. However, hyperinflammation downstream of excessive cytokine stimulation can promote disease exacerbation (see below), and high doses of TNF cause necroptotic macrophage death and extra cellular bacterial replication. Current cytokine-based HDT approaches mostly involve IFN\u03b3 or modulators of TNF. For example, the delivery of aerosolized IFN\u03b3 to patients with TB has been shown to reduce time to sputum conversion without consistent improvement of the chest radiological outcome 105, 106 . In small trials carried out in cohorts of patients with drug-resistant TB, adjunct therapy with IFN\u03b3, in addition to facilitating bacterial killing, improved lung repair [107] [108] [109] . However, cytokine-based HDT strategies that modulate TNF as an adjunct to canonical chemotherapy seem to be more promising, as they considerably shorten therapy duration, improve pathology and limit TB relapse in experimental models (as detailed below).",

A form of tuberculosis (TB) caused by bacilli that are resistant to first-line drugs (isoniazid and rifampin; known as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB)) and any fluoroquinolone (such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, kanamycin or capreomycin). Therapy for XDR TB often fails. cytokine production and induces lymphocyte apoptosis. Impaired T cell immunity promotes Mtb replication and subsequent tissue damage. Building on the impressive success achieved in cancer immunotherapy 119 , checkpoint blockade has been considered for TB therapy (FIG. 3) . This includes monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are specific for PD1 (such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and for cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4; such as ipilimumab). The T cell expression of PD1 gradually decreases during canonical chemotherapy, with a concurrent increase in T H 1 cell responses [120] [121] [122] . Moreover, the expression of PDL1 on macrophages 123 and neutrophils 124 has been reported in patients with TB and has been linked to impaired T cell and natural killer T (NKT) cell functions 122, 125 . In vitro treatment with a PD1 mAb of cell cultures derived from patients with TB reduced immunosuppression by blocking T cell apoptosis, restoring IFN\u03b3 production and triggering IFN\u03b3-dependent killing of Mtb-infected macrophages 122, 123 . Similarly, the increased surface expression of CTLA4 has also been reported in TB 121, 126, 127 , and the checkpoint receptor LAG3 was found to be highly expressed by CD4 + T cells and NK cells in the lungs of non-human primates that progressed to active TB, but not in animals with LTBI 128 . This observation suggests that changes in LAG3 expression patterns influence disease outcome and Mtb replication. Finally, the blockade of TIM3, another checkpoint receptor on T cells, increases the propensity of myeloid cells to kill Mtb. These effects were linked to the increased production of IFN\u03b3 by T cells and the increased production of IL-1\u03b2 by Mtb-infected macrophages 129, 130 . Moreover, release from T cell exhaustion that is caused by the blockade of TIM3 has improved Mtb control in mice that are chronically infected with TB 131 . However, interventions using checkpoint inhibitors in general warrant caution because blocking the inhibitory effect of PD1 on T cells thereby increases the IFN\u03b3-producing capacity of lung-homing subsets of CD4 + T cells and has caused extensive lung pathology in murine models of TB 132 . Finally, anti-PD1 therapy can reactivate LTBI 133 , suggesting that checkpoint blockade should be considered only in adjunct to canonical TB chemotherapy.",

GM-CSF stimulates the generation of granulocytes and monocytes or macrophages; a predominant function of IFN\u03b3 is to activate monocytes and macrophages. Although small early studies of GM-CSF and IFN\u03b3 in patients with protracted sepsis seemed promising 142, 143 , subsequent trials failed to demonstrate a consistent benefit 144, 149 . More recently, investigators have targeted therapy with GM-CSF and IFN\u03b3 to patients who are in the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis [146] [147] [148] . In a study of 38 patients with sepsis with low monocyte HLA-DR expression, GM-CSF therapy shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation, improved the severity of illness scores, and reduced the length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays 147 . GM-CSF was also efficacious in a study of immunosuppressed paediatric patients with sepsis, who were identified by measuring ex vivo whole-blood lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated TNF production 148 . GM-CSF administration to patients improved ex vivo LPS-stimulated whole-blood TNF production and decreased the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Based on these encouraging results, a multicentre trial of GM-CSF in sepsis is currently under way 150 .",

            "text": "Perhaps the most exciting immuno-adjuvant agent in sepsis is IL-7, a cytokine that is essential for the survival of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. IL-7 has multiple beneficial effects on host immunity, including the proliferation and activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and it also increases the surface expression of cell adhesion molecules, thereby facilitating the trafficking of T cells to sites of infection. IL-7 also counteracts sepsis-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes. This anti-apoptotic effect of IL-7 is particularly important because the severe depletion of immune effector cells -including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, B cells and DCs -is a pathophysiological hallmark of sepsis 141, [152] [153] [154] . Multiple studies from independent laboratories have shown that IL-7 improves survival in various clinically relevant animal models of sepsis 155 . Importantly, it has been shown that IL-7 is effective in reversing T cell dysfunction in circulating immune cells from patients with septic shock 154 . So far, IL-7, which has been given to more than 300 patients in the treatment of various disorders, has consistently increased circulating absolute lymphocyte counts, and has been well tolerated 152 . In patients with AIDS, IL-7 restored the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue, leading to decreased circulating markers of inflammation 153 . This effect may also be particularly helpful in patients with sepsis, as the loss of gut barrier integrity in sepsis is thought to facilitate the translocation of bacteria and/or LPS into the circulation, thereby driving the inflammatory response. IL-7 has also been administered on a compassionate basis to patients with lymphopenia and John Cunningham (JC) virus-induced progressive multi-focal leukoencephalopathy. In this setting, IL-7 increased lymphocyte counts and decreased JC virus load and survival 156 . A multicentre clinical trial of IL-7 in sepsis is currently ongoing 157 . (table)) . A post-mortem study in patients with sepsis showed findings that were consistent with T cell exhaustion, including the upregulation of PD1 and PDL1 on immune cells and severely impaired cytokine secretion 116 . Importantly, multiple independent groups have reported that PD1 is overexpressed on circulating T cells in patients with sepsis and that the incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with specific antibodies against PD1 or PDL1 can restore impaired cytokine production and can decrease sepsis-induced apoptosis [116] [117] [118] . Moreover, animal models of sepsis have shown that the delayed administration of PD1-and PDL1-blocking anti bodies improves survival. Given the surprising overlap in the immunological deficits in cancer and sepsis 158 , and the remarkable success of PD1 and PDL1 inhibition in cancer immunotherapy 119 , there is a strong rationale for trials of these antibodies in sepsis, and a small multicentre, dose safety trial of anti-PDL1 in patients with sepsis has recently been completed 159 .

Thymosin \u03b11 showed efficacy in improving survival in a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial of 361 patients with sepsis.

For example, in most acute viral infections, disease symptoms manifest when viraemia is already declining and so selective antiviral therapy is often initiated too late. However, suppressing exacerbated disease symptoms that are triggered by the pathogen at later time points can reduce morbidity and mortality. Such HDTs require a detailed understanding of pathogen-host interactions, but hold promise for reducing disease symptoms to the level of a self-limiting infection.",

            "text": "The devastating consequences of viral infections frequently arise from an excessive, often uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such cytokine storms can be triggered by multiple mechanisms, including the hyperactivation of TLRs. Examples include dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which are most often caused by secondary infection with a heterologous serotype of dengue virus (DENV). These serious cases are characterized by the uncontrolled hyperproduction of cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF, IFNs, CC motif chemokine 8 (CCL8) and CXC motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), ultimately leading to vascular leakage and shock syndrome 162 . Key drivers of cytokine storms seem to be high-level viraemia, the ligation of DENV-immunoglobulin complexes to myeloid or mast cells, and the secreted version of the viral protein NS1, all of which drive excessive pro-inflammatory responses, while reducing anti-inflammatory ones. NS1 binds to TLR4 and induces the production of the same cytokines that are detected during the course of severe dengue disease and enhances vascular permeability 163 . Blocking NS1-mediated TLR4 activation with a TLR4 antagonist or with a TLR4-specific antibody markedly reduced vascular leakage both in vitro and in a mouse model of DENV infection 163 . Moreover, autophagy induction in endothelial cells seems to be required for NS1-induced vascular leakage, which can be blocked by autophagy inhibitors 164 . Finally, DENV NS1 also promotes vascular leakage by inducing the expression of enzymes such as sialidases and heparanase that degrade the glycocalyx layer that lines the endothelium on the luminal side, thus diminishing its barrier function and enhancing fluid extravasation 165 . Although to the best of our knowledge no clinical trials have yet been conducted, these results hold great promise for the suppression of exacerbated inflammation by targeting NS1-specific ligands and receptors. Alternative strategies for HDTbased symptomatic treatment of severe dengue disease are based on immunosuppressive therapy with steroids such as prednisolone, but so far these have met with only limited success 166, 167 . The concept of modulating inflammation was also evaluated in influenza virus infection, in which cytokine storms can cause acute and sometimes fatal immunemediated pulmonary injury. It has been proposed that acute lung injury that is triggered by infection with respiratory viruses and bacteria induces, via ROS, the production of pathogenic oxidized lipids that activate TLR4 and induce a cytokine storm 168 . Consistently, Tlr4-deficient mouse mutants are protected from lethal challenge with a mouse-adapted influenza virus strain 169 . Notably, the TLR4 antagonist eritoran, an investigational drug for the treatment of severe sepsis, consistently decreased lung pathology and clinical symptoms in various in vivo influenza models 170 . These encouraging results, together with the well-established safety profile of eritoran and the observation that it can be given up to 6 days after influenza virus infection in mice, qualifies this compound as an interesting candidate for the prevention of severe influenza.",

Although these cells contribute to protection against influenza virus infection, heightened neutrophil recruitment correlates with the virulence of a given influenza virus strain 181 . For this reason, inhibitors of neutrophil chemotaxis have been developed. Danirixin is a clinically advanced inhibitor of CXCR2, a chemokine receptor that drives neutrophil migration. Danirixin was developed for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and it has been found to be well tolerated and it does not induce major safety concerns 182 . Based on these results, a phase II clinical trial is currently recruiting patients to receive Danirixin either alone or in combination with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir for the therapy of influenza virus infection in adults 183 .",

Inflammatory pathways, involving both pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators (primarily cytokines and lipids) are sequentially turned on and off in TB 184 . Accordingly, mechanisms that restrict and promote inflammation are relevant both at distinct disease stages and at specific infection sites. An imbalance of these responses, rather than solely an exacerbated pro-inflammatory response, is the characteristic feature of TB. Different forms of lesions, such as solid, fibrotic, mineralized and caseating granulomas, as well as cavities and foci of pneumonia, can coexist within a patient 185 ; even within a single lesion, inflammatory mediators are segregated into distinct regions 186 . Therefore, concurrent application of pro-and anti-inflammatory intervention may become a necessity. Such a therapy concept for the spatiotemporal coexistence of hyper-and hypoinflammation poses a great challenge that has barely begun to be addressed experimentally 187 . Current HDT approaches comprise small molecules and biologics that target anti-and pro-inflammatory pathways as adjunctive measures for TB therapy (FIG. 3; Supplementary information S2 (table) ).",

The COX product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a proapoptotic eicosanoid that protects against necrotic cell death during mycobacterial infections 188 . Mtb skews the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway towards lipoxygenase (LOX) activation and the generation of pro-necrotic lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). The modulation of this axis by zileuton, a clinically licensed 5-LOX inhibitor for the treatment of asthma, and the nasal application of PGE2, can restrict lung pathology in murine TB 189 (FIG. 3) . Combination therapy of zileuton and PGE2 boosts cytoprotective IL-1\u03b2 production by limiting type I IFN production and by restricting Mtb replication. Balanced PGE2 and LXA4 levels are probably involved in the successful control of Mtb in LTBI compared with active TB. During active TB, IL-1 concentrations are increased [190] [191] [192] and the abundance of IL-1 correlates with the extent of tissue damage that is mediated by neutrophils 193 . In LTBI, the early production of PGE2 seems to be essential for protection, whereas heightened PGE2 levels at later stages of infection impair immune defence and promote progression to disease 194, 195 . COX inhibitors -such as ibuprofen 195 , aspirin 196 and diclofenac 197, 198 -given alone or in combination with canonical TB drugs, limit bacillary loads and prolong the survival of TB-susceptible mice. In addition, ibuprofen has direct antitubercular activity 199 (FIG. 3) . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, inhibit PGE2 production and enhance LXA4 generation, which in addition to its effects on Mtb-induced cell death also shows anti-inflammatory functions. NSAIDs, by limiting PGE release and inducing lipoxin production, lower TNF abundance 188 , and thus are likely to ameliorate local inflammation. Certain NSAIDs, notably aspirin, have already entered clinical trials for TB [200] [201] [202] . Ibuprofen was also registered in a phase II clinical trial for therapy of XDR TB 203 .",

For example, the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, which is licensed for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, has been associated with the reactivation of LTBI 214 and impaired bacillary containment in murine TB 215 . The coadministration of tofacitinib with canonical chemotherapy was beneficial in selected models of TB, suggesting that the activity of JAK inhibitors is influenced by patterns of inflammation and granulomatous responses 216 . Additional approaches to modulate TNF signalling or abundance include thalidomide analogues 48 and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors 217 . Thalidomide improved treatment outcome in a pilot study in pulmonary TB 218 ; however, a clinical trial to test adjunct thalidomide therapy in paediatric TB was terminated owing to adverse events, including skin rash, hepatitis, severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 219 . As thalidomide is teratogenic, thalidomide analogues with better safety profiles have been synthesized. Analogues that inhibit PDE4 signalling by increasing cAMP levels have shown beneficial effects as adjuncts to canonical TB chemotherapy in mouse and rabbit models of infection [220] [221] [222] . These compounds accelerate bacillary clearance and promote lung repair. Other PDE inhibitors, including cilostazol (an inhibitor of PDE3) and sildenafil (an inhibitor of PDE5), showed similar effects 215, 223 . The nonspecific PDE inhibitor pentoxifylline was unsuccessful in TB trials, despite reducing TNF levels and inducing TB progression when administered as a monotherapy in mouse models 224, 225 . The most advanced PDE inhibitor in preclinical studies, CC-11050, has completed phase I trials 48 , and a phase II trial is planned to compare CC-11050, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus, the thioredoxin reductase inhibitor auranofin and vitamin D as HDT adjuncts to standard chemotherapy for the accelerated cure of drug-sensitive TB 95, 202, 208 .",

            "text": "Another approach to restricting local inflammation includes the co-delivery of glucocorticoid receptor agonists, such as prednisolone and dexamethasone, with TB chemotherapy. The effects of glucocorticoids on immune cells are multifaceted. Corticosteroids reduce the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, notably TNF, restrict the migration of inflammatory cells and cause apoptosis. For patients with TB, such interventions are beneficial because they counteract inflammation and are likely to improve drug penetration into granulomas, fostering the clearance of metabolically active Mtb as a consequence of lesion destabilization. Adjunct treatment with glucocorticoids began more than five decades ago for patients with different forms of the disease, including TB meningitis, TB pericarditis and pulmonary TB 226 . In many cases, corticosteroids seemed to improve the resolution of lesions, albeit without major long-term benefits 227 . A recent meta-analysis indicated that glucocorticoid receptor agonists mostly reduce TB mortality when the central nervous system is affected, notably, in TB meningitis 227 . The benefits of glucocorticoids depend on the genotype of the patient 228 , indicating that divergent effects are the result of different patterns of inflammationgenotype-specific hypo-or hyper-inflammation -in different patients, which influence Mtb replication. A meta-regression analysis of pulmonary TB revealed that, in addition to genotype effects, the dosage of corticosteroids affects sputum conversion in patients with TB 229 . A phase II clinical trial that tested corticosteroids in combination with standard chemotherapy for TB in patients co-infected with HIV indicated faster sputum conversion, but also adverse events at high dosages 230 . Further studies to more carefully assess the risks and benefits of glucocorticoids are underway, and the delivery of glucocorticoids has been prioritized as an HDT for specific patient groups, such as those suffering from TB and AIDS comorbidity. The use of prednisone or the NSAID drug meloxicam for the prevention of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is observed in patients co-infected with HIV and Mtb, has reached phase III and phase II trial stages, respectively 231, 232 . Similarly, the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone is now in phase II/III and phase IV trials for the therapy of meningeal TB 233, 234 .",

Consequently, HDTs that promote vascular perfusion can improve drug delivery. However, such a strategy may equally benefit Mtb by facilitating access to nutrients and permissive host cells. The situation is somewhat reminiscent of neoplastic diseases, in which tumours actively promote angiogenesis to improve blood supply and to alleviate local hypoxia at late stages of tumour development. The outcome of vasculogenesis-focused HDT for TB is likely to depend on the stage of disease and the treatment objective, namely, interference with either angiogenesis or vascular permeability. In patients with active TB, factors that induce neovascularization, notably vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR, are abundant in the circulation [238] [239] [240] and have been proposed as biomarkers of disease severity 241 . Bevacizumab, a mAb against VEGF, is approved for the treatment of certain cancers, and several other antibodies that target VEGF or VEGFR are in clinical trials. In animal models of TB, VEGF and VEGFR inhibitors have revealed beneficial effects when given in combination with conventional drugs, by limiting bacterial dissemination and boosting the activity of drugs that target hypoxic Mtb 242, 243 . Conversely, there is a risk that the administration of such biologics without concurrent chemotherapy may promote TB reactivation 244, 245 and bacillary dissemination 240 .",

This metabolic adjustment, known as the Warburg effect, is well established in cancer 252 . Therapies that limit aerobic glycolysis, including the delivery of 2-deoxyglucose as an anti-glycolytic agent, can restrict bioenergetic pathways that support Mtb replication. Moreover, interfering with the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-AMPK signalling pathway can inhibit glutamine entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and thus can revert the local Warburg metabolism. Metformin is an AMPK activator and thus its efficacy as an HDT goes beyond its effects on macrophages (as discussed above), as it has the potential to interfere with the immune metabolism of granulomas. Less well-explored, but still of interest, are bioenergetic shifts that encompass the generation of itaconic acid, a structural analogue of succinate, which controls TCA remodelling in macrophages, and which has an anti-mycobacterial function 253 . Additional metabolic changes in granulomas lead to the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which affect macrophage death and activation 254 .
