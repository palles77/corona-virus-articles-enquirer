In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the immune responses of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells induced by HLA-A*0201 restricted severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S epitopes plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN), PolyI:C and R848 as adjuvants. Furthermore, the generation, distribution and phenotype of long-lasting peptide-specific memory CD8 + T cells were assessed by ELISA, ELISPOT and flow cytometry. Our results showed that antigen specific CD8 + T cells were elicited by HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS-CoV S epitopes. Furthermore, the frequency of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells was dramatically increased after both prime and boost immunization with peptides plus CpG ODN, whereas slight enhancements were induced following boost vaccination with peptides plus PolyI:C or R848. SARS-CoV S peptide-specific IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T cells were distributed throughout the lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Results also demonstrated that the HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells induced by peptides plus CpG ODN carried a memory cell phenotype with CD45RB + and CD62L \u2212 and possessed long-term survival ability in vivo. Taken together, our results implied that HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS-CoV S epitopes plus CpG ODN might be the superior candidates for SARS vaccine.",

In our previous study, we have identified five epitopes for CD8 + T cells in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mouse by \"DNA prime, peptide boost\" strategy [13] . However, their poor immunogenicity emphasizes a major unmet need for immunostimulatory adjuvants to safely boost cellular immune responses. Vaccinations with adjuvants that mimic toll-like receptors (TLR) ligands are advantageous as they are capable of eliciting positive effects across the entire spectrum of innate and adaptive immunity. Our previous data has demonstrated the additive effects of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN), R848 and PIKA as adjuvants on augmenting immune responses to HBsAg vaccination [19, 20] . CpG, PolyI:C and R848 which are ligands for TLR9, TLR3 and TLR7 respectively can activate antigen-presenting cells and lead to T cell priming and acquired immunity.",

Cells were first gated on CD8 + T cells and the phenotype of IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T cells was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5 , most of IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + T cells from spleens expressed CD45RB in peptides alone and peptides plus CpG ODN groups.

Here, we were interested in whether long survival memory CD8 + T cells could be elicited following peptides plus CpG ODN vaccination. Therefore, we extended our study to further characterize SARS S HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific long-persistent memory T cell responses 30 d after the boost immunization. According to the data from ELISA and ELISPOT, we found that mice immunized with peptides in combination with CpG ODN still maintained high level of cellular immune responses in splenocytes though 30 d had passed since the second vaccination. As shown in Fig. 6 , splenocytes stimulated by specific peptides in vitro secreted higher level of IFN-\u2425 than controls (P < 0.05). Based on the IFN-\u2425 production, the frequency of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells were \u223c58 spots in 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells. The results suggested that peptidespecific CD8 + T cells induced by peptides plus CpG ODN vaccination have a long-time life span in vivo.

            "text": "Currently, the adjuvant which has been approved by FDA to be used clinically is alum. Although aluminum is able to induce a good Th2 response, it has weak capacity to stimulate strong cellular immune responses which are very important for protection against many pathogens [21] . An adjuvant which is usually used to enhance the immunogenicity of a vaccine will be required to promote not only humoral immune responses but also cellular immune responses. The molecular mechanism underlying adjuvant activity has been poorly understood for a long time, but this field has been rapidly evolving since the discovery of the TLR family of proteins and their corresponding innate ligands [22] . CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 are specific ligands for TLR which are the critical links between the innate and the adaptive immunity [23] [24] [25] . In our previous reports, we have studied that CpG ODN, R848 and PIKA as adjuvants could enhance HBs Ag-specific T cell responses [19, 20] . With regard to SARS, there was a new report proved that co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with PIKA as adjuvant could induce a much higher neutralizing activity in animal models [26] . However, there is no related report to ascertain which adjuvant will be superior in HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS S peptide vaccine. Therefore, in the present study we evaluated the efficiency of synthetic CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 as adjuvants in combination with CD8 + T cell epitope vaccine of SARS to immunize HLA-A*0201 Tg mice.",

            "text": "CpG ODN, PolyI:C and R848 as adjuvants are identified to be specific ligands for TLR which are potent activators of innate immune responses, activating dendritic cell (DC) maturation and inflammatory cytokine secretion, inducing an increase in the cross talk between the innate and adaptive immune systems, and thereby driving the expansion of CTLs that can destroy virus infected target cells. Our results showed that the CD8 + T cell responses to CpG ODN were superior to those of PolyI:C and R848, which may be due to several reasons. First, different TLRs or even different ligands for the same TLR can differ substantially in their ability to induce production of peptide-specific primary and memory CD8 + T cell responses. It has been reported that CpG ODN is a very potent inducer of IL-12, which directs differentiation of CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells into type I effectors [27] . McCluskie et al. compared the efficacy of CpG ODN and R-848 for topical immunoprophylaxis or immunotherapy of vaginal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections in mice. They found that efficacy against HSV infection was observed with CpG ODN but less so with R-848, even after repeated administrations [28] . Furthermore, evidence from Rothenfusser et al. proved that two distinct types of CpG ODN have been identified that differ in their capacity to stimulate CD8 + T cells. CpG-B seems to be superior for priming CD8 + T cell responses and CpG-A selectively enhances memory CD8 + T cell responses [29] . As we know, CpG ODN as ligand for TLR9 can signal via MyD88-independent pathway to lead to the activation of NF-B, a critical transcription factor for induction of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, TLR9 signaling can also induce type I interferon via IRF7 pathway. TLR3 recognizing PolyI:C uses TRIF-IRF3 pathway, while TLR7 recognizing R848 uses MyD88 but not TIRAP or TIRF. Therefore, it is clear that different TLR signaling profoundly affects the innate immune response which is related to the cascading activation of adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, there are differences in the responses of DC to different TLR ligands. TLR9 is expressed by both plasmacytoid and non-plasmacytoid DC, whether from spleen, thymus or grown in vitro from bone marrow progenitors, and respond to CpG [30] . Mouse spleen plasmacytoid DC also express TLR7, but especially striking is the fact that splenic CD8\u2423 + DCs do not express TLR7 mRNA and do not respond to R848 in vitro [31] . In contrast, CD8\u2423 + DCs display the highest expression of TLR3 message, which appears to be absent from plasmacytoid DC [30, 31] . However, the situation is somewhat different in human. Because human blood contains at least two distinct DC types, the CD11c + DC and the plasmacytoid DC, as well as the monocyte precursors of Mo-DC [32] . If the present results are also the case in human, it is possible that use of CpG ODN with SARS epitope vaccine in human would prove superior to PolyI:C and R848. However, this would need to be further tested in clinical studies. Finally, detailed dose response analyses are also required to allow distinction between quantitative and qualitative effects of TLR ligation. According to the previous reports, the response was optimal when 25 g of soluble CpG ODN was coinjected per animal, but it also decreased at higher doses. The same phenomenon was found in PolyI:C which optimal CTL responses were obtained at 5 g [33] . Whether these declines occurred because of functional exhaustion of CD8 + T cells by overloading the system with antigen or not remains to be investigated.",

It suggests that CpG ODN maybe not only increase the frequency of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells but also affect their phenotype. Therefore, we further focused on the phenotype of peptide-specific memory CD8 + T cells and detected the expression of CD45RB as a surface marker for memory T cell in mice and the expression of CD62L, which is considered as a standard to distinguish central memory T cells from effector memory T cells. We detected the expression of CD45RB and CD62L on CD8 + T cells from mice immunized with peptides in the absence or presence of CpG ODN. On the basis of IFN-\u2425 production, it showed that the percentage of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells was significantly enhanced by CpG ODN. Meanwhile, antigenspecific CD8 + T cells carried a phenotype of CD45RB + and CD62L \u2212 . However, no significant difference was found in the expression of CD45RB and CD62L between the peptides alone and peptides plus CpG ODN group. These results indicate that CpG ODN increases the quantity of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells but does not affect the quality of the antigen specific memory CD8 + T cells.",
