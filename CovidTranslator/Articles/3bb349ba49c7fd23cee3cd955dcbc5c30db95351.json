Nsp9 has been shown to be essential for viral RNA synthesis and replication based on deletion experiments in MHV (Deming et al., 2007) . The presence of two molecules of nsp9 per asymmetric unit may indicate that the protein functions as a dimer, as is the case for SARS-CoV nsp9 (Campanacci et al., 2003) . Based on available structural data, nsp9 has been proposed to possess the function of stabilizing nascent nucleic acids during RNA synthesis and participating in such base-pairing-driven processes based on its single-stranded RNA-binding properties (Egloff et al., 2004) .",

The gene encoding HKU1 nsp9 (corresponding to Asn4211-Gln4320, where the numbering is that of the entire polyprotein) was amplified by the PCR method using forward and reverse primers 5 0 -CGGGATCCAATAATGAGTTGATGCCT-3 0 and 5 0 -C-CGCTCGAGTTACTGCAATCTAATTGTTG-3 0 , respectively, and then inserted between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6p-1 plasmid. After verifying the sequence, the recombinant plasmid was # 2009 International Union of Crystallography All rights reserved transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Cultures were grown in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin at 310 K until the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) reached 0.6. 0.5 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added and the cultures were induced to express HKU1 nsp9 at 289 K for 16 h. Centrifugation was used to harvest the cells and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 pH 7.3) supplemented with 1 mM DTT. After sonication at 277 K, the lysate was centrifuged at 12 000g for 50 min at 277 K and the precipitate was discarded. The supernatant was loaded onto a GSTglutathione affinity column (Pharmacia). The fusion protein was then cleaved on the column by GST-rhinovirus 3C protease at 277 K for 18 h; five additional residues (GPLGS) were left at the N-terminus of HKU1 nsp9. The cleavage buffer of the protease was PBS and the ratio of protease to protein was approximately 1:50. Thermo iCON concentrators were used to concentrate the protein. After concentration using a Thermo Centra-CL3R, a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) was used to purify the HKU1 nsp9 in a buffer containing 20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl pH 6.0. Typical yields were 3 mg of purified protein per litre of bacterial culture.",
