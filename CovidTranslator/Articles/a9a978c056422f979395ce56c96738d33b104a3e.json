While cytoskeletal arrangements 386 for RF assembly within ER folds are characteristic of flaviviruses, we found that RNase L 387 expression during DENV and KUNV infection had only minimal effects on RF formation. 388",

Many viruses have subsequently developed 98 mechanisms for evading RNase L antiviral effects, most of which target this pathway 99 upstream of RNase L activation through degradation or sequestration of OAS proteins or 100 degradation of 2-5A (Silverman, 2007, Zhao et al., 2012, Drappier et al., 2018, Silverman 101 and Weiss, 2014, Sanchez-Tacuba et al., 2015, Goldstein et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 102 2013). We recently demonstrated that ZIKV avoids antiviral effects of activated RNase L, 103 and that this evasion strategy required assembly of RFs to protect genome from RNase 104 L cleavage (Whelan et al., 2019). Despite substantial RNase L-mediated cleavage of 105 intracellular ZIKV genome, a portion of uncleaved genome was shielded from activated 106 RNase L within RFs. This genome was sufficient to produce high levels of infectious virus 107 particles, as infectious ZIKV released from WT cells was significantly higher than from 108 RNase L KO cells. These results indicated that RNase L expression was ultimately 109 proviral during ZIKV infection (Figure 1A, right panel). Unlike ZIKV, DENV RFs did not 110 obstruct antiviral RNase L activity, and infectious virus production was instead decreased 111 in the presence of RNase L (Whelan et al., 2019, Lin et al., 2009).

As 176 shown in Figure 1, ZIKV activation of RNase L is dependent on OAS3 expression, 177 therefore deletion of OAS3 eliminates RNase L catalytic activity without affecting RNase 178 L levels (Li et al., 2016). To confirm RNase L latency in OAS3 KO cells, we measured 2-179 5A, the activator of RNase L synthesized by OAS enzymes, with a fluorescence 180 resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay during ZIKV infection of WT, RNase L KO, and 181 OAS3 KO cells. We detected 2-5A generation during ZIKV infection of both WT and 182RNase L KO cells, however 2-5A in ZIKV-infected OAS3 KO cells was not increased over 183 levels in mock infected WT cells(Figure 3A).

Despite this evidence, we wanted to further investigate whether ZIKV 262 genome localization during infection of OAS3 KO cells (Figure 4A&D) was due to non-263 catalytic, proviral effects of RNase L on RF structure, and not a result of activated RNase 264 L cleavage of ZIKV genome residing outside of RFs.

These results correlate with absence of dsRNA detection in 291 only WT cells after pIC transfection (Figure 5C), and establish that RNase L is not 292 catalytically active in OAS3 KO cells.

Quantification 351 confirmed that the absence of RNase L lowered ZIKV dsRNA expression and 352 concentration, as measured by intensity and circularity of dsRNA staining, respectively 353 (Figure 7C). In paclitaxel treated WT cells, ZIKV dsRNA and NS3 staining resembled that 354 of RNase L KO with or without paclitaxel (Figure 7B).

Additionally, paclitaxel 357 had no effect on dsRNA intensity and minimal impact on circularity in RNase L KO cells 358 (Figure 7C). We validated effects of paclitaxel treatment on microtubule stability by 359 staining btubulin, which together with atubulin makes up microtubules. In ZIKV infected 360 WT cells, btubulin localized to dsRNA staining, which agrees with previous findings of 361 ZIKV-induced microtubule rearrangements surrounding RFs (Figure 7D) (Cortese et al., 362 2017).

Moreover, RNase L deletion 397 enhanced DENV genome expression (Figure 4B&E), which correlates with increased 398 titers in RNase L KO cells, and suggests that RNase L is activated during DENV infection. 399 Indeed, our previous study indicated RNase L activation and degradation of DENV RNA 400 during infection (Whelan et al., 2019). While rRNA degradation is a hallmark of RNase L 401 nucleolytic activity and therefore a commonly used marker for RNase L activation, it is 402 possible that host rRNA effectively avoids activated RNase L while viral genome is 403 primarily targeted during DENV infection in particular (Li et al., 1998, Rath et al., 2015, 404 Donovan et al., 2017). Though these results present an interesting possibility, there is 405 currently no knowledge of RNase L catalytic function independent of OAS-mediated 406 activation, thus further investigation is required for elucidation of the mechanism behind 407 RNase L restriction of DENV. 408Use of pIC to activate RNase L prior to ZIKV generation of protective RFs (Figure 409",

Since HeLa M 416 cells do not express endogenous RNase L, the empty vector-expressing cells served as 417 an RNase L-deficient control for these experiments. In addition, HeLa M cells were 418 permissive to flavivirus infection and therefore offered a convenient system for isolation 419 of RNase L catalytic and non-catalytic functions during infection. However, one caveat 420 we encountered was the variance in RNase L WT and R667A protein levels, which 421 occurred when overexpressing these constructs in several cell types. RNase L activation 422 induces apoptosis to limit viral infection, therefore it was important to eliminate the 423 possibility of spontaneous activation of RNase L and subsequent induction of apoptosis 424 in cells stably expressing RNase L WT, which would reduce cell quantity. We verified that 425 RNase L was not activated in uninfected HeLa M cells expressing RNase L WT, as we 426 did not detect any rRNA degradation in mock infected cells (Figure 6B, 3 rd column). 427 Moreover, levels of RNase L WT in HeLa M cells were sufficient for rRNA degradation 428 (Figure 6B) and slightly reduced KUNV production (Figure 6E), indicating antiviral RNase 429 L activity. Since we were interested in confirming a non-catalytic function of RNase L, this 430 system was effective for corroborating results in A549 cells, in addition to providing a 431 second cell line in which inactive RNase L enhanced ZIKV production. 432 After establishing that latent RNase L facilitated ZIKV RF formation, we next 433 sought to link RNase L proviral effects on ZIKV infection with RNase L-cytoskeleton 434 interactions. Interest in cytoskeleton involvement stemmed from an earlier study showing 435 L interacted with the cytoskeletal protein Filamin A for inhibition of viral 436 entry. That study also determined that this interaction required RNase L latency, and was 437 dissociated upon catalytic activation of RNase L (Malathi et al., 2014), which correlates 438 with our proposed function of inactive RNase L during ZIKV infection. Another study 439 described the cytoskeleton-containing cellular fraction as also comprising a form of 440 RNase L that was unresponsive to catalytic activation by 2-5A (Tnani et al., 1998). 441 Proteomics analysis in a human cell line identified IQGAP1 (an IQ [isoleucineglutamine] 442 motif containing GTPase activating protein 1), a mediator of actin cytoskeleton 443 reorganization, as an RNase L binding partner (Sato et al., 2010), and another report 444 revealed 62% of RNase L interactions in mouse spleens were with cytoskeleton and 445 motor proteins (Gupta and Rath, 2014). Additionally, RNase L interacts with a regulator 446 of tight junctions, ligand of nump protein X (LNX) (Ezelle et al., 2016), although none of 447 these findings were in the context of virus infection. 448 While RNase L function during ZIKV infection is the first suggestion of a proviral 449 inactive RNase L role, the aforementioned latent RNase L interaction with Filamin A 450 indicated that RNase L can actively remodel cytoskeleton during viral infection, which is 451 consistent with reports of virus manipulation of cytoskeletal components to facilitate virus 452 replication cycle events (Foo and Chee, 2015, Walsh and Naghavi, 2018). It is known that 453 ZIKV induces extensive cytoskeletal remodeling during infection to establish RFs within 454 invaginations of the ER (Cortese et al., 2017).

Furthermore, attempts at 460 IFA detection of tagged RNase L localization during infection were inconclusive with 461 unequal overexpression levels of RNase L WT and R667A. We instead used the 462 microtubule stabilizing drug paclitaxel to recapitulate the ZIKV RF phenotype of RNase L 463 KO cells. Paclitaxel-mediated loss of microtubule flexibility disturbed ZIKV RF assembly 464 and function and consequently reduced virus production, as was observed in RNase L 465 KO cells (Figure 7). These results supported ZIKV employment of RNase L's association 466 with the cytoskeletal to generate RFs (Figure 7). Distinctions in host protein composition 467 of ZIKV RFs compared to that of other flaviviruses have been described (Cortese et al., 468 2017). Since RNase L improves production of ZIKV but not DENV or KUNV, it is possible 469 that RNase L is another ZIKV RF component not shared among all flaviviruses. Inactive 470 RNase L participation in ZIKV RF formation also implies lower availability of activated 471 RNase L proximal to ZIKV RFs, which offers explanation for ZIKV protection from antiviral 472 effects of RNase L, while DENV and KUNV are sensitive to RNase L activity. 473 Despite clear alterations in ZIKV RF shape and function without RNase L 474 facilitation of cytoskeleton remodeling, ZIKV RFs still form and function to a degree in the 475 absence of RNase L. This suggests redundancy in host protein manipulation for cellular 476 remodeling by ZIKV, and is supported by the existence of RFs even after RNase L is 477 activated and cleaving ZIKV genome outside RF sites. Additionally, the dissemination of 478 ZIKV RFs in RNase L KO cells occurred in a majority of infected cells, but not in every 479 infected cell, indicating that other host proteins may compensate for the loss of RNase L. examining RNase L interaction with specific ZIKV proteins or genome are 481 required to identify if RNase L is directly involved in assembly of ZIKV RFs. 482 Acknowledgements 483 We thank Erick R.
