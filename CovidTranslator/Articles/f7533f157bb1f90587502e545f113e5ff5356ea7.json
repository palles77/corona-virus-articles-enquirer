While infection of humans remains inefficient, many of those with H5N1 disease have a rapidly progressing viral pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death but its pathogenesis remains an enigma. Comparisons in the virology and pathogenesis of human seasonal influenza viruses (H3N2 and H1N1) and H5N1 in patients, animal models and in relevant primary human cell cultures remains instructive. While the direct effects of viral replication and differences in the tropism of the virus for cells in the lower respiratory tract clearly contribute to the pathogenesis, we focus here on the possible contribution of the host innate immune response in the pathogenesis of this disease.",

The virus haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the major surface proteins of the virus which induce protective host antibody responses and they are classified into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes by antigenic analysis. Influenza virus is a single stranded RNA virus with an 8-segmented genome. As with other RNA viruses, mutations generate genetic and antigenic diversity (\"genetic drift\"). The segmented RNA genome allows the virus an additional mechanism for generating diversity through genetic reassortment. The pandemics of 1957 and 1968 arose by the prevailing human H1N1 influenza virus acquiring a novel HA and the polymerase basic 1 (PB1) gene (and in 1957 also the NA) from an avian source to generate a virus with a novel subtype; H2N2 in 1957 and H3N2 in 1968 1 . The origin of the H1N1 virus in 1918 remains controversial, with some arguing that it arose from an avian virus directly (i.e. all 8 gene segments) adapting to efficient transmission in humans 2 while others contend that it is also derived by reassortment 3 .",

However, this virus has so far not adapted to efficient humanto-human transmission. In early 2009, a novel H1N1 variant (H1N1v) virus of swine origin emerged and has now become pandemic 5 . This confounded the previously held dogma that an influenza pandemic is associated with the emergence of a virus with a novel HA subtype. The novel H1N1 virus is antigenically distant from the prevailing human H1N1 virus and there is little prior cross-reacting humoral immunity in the population with the exception of those inviduals older than 60 years or so 6 . Thus we now have a pandemic virus of an influenza subtype (H1N1) that is already endemic in the human population. It remains to be seen whether the novel pandemic H1N1 2009 virus will replace or co-circulate with the previously endemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Although the infection appears to be comparatively mild, some patients have developed fatal pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 7 but information on the pathogenesis of pandemic H1N1 is still emerging 8 . In this review we will focus on innate immune responses in the pathogenesis of lung disease caused by influenza, with a particular emphasis on human H5N1 disease.",

Virus antigen has been detected in alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages.

NS1 binds double stranded RNA thereby preventing the activation of 2'5'oligo(A) synthetase and the downstream consequences of its activation. NS1 interacts with RIG-1 RNA helicase and suppresses its normal function as a cytosolic innate immune sensor of viral infection 23 . The four carboxy-terminal amino acids of NS1 form a PDZ ligand domain motif which is relevant in mouse virulence 24 . The PB1 gene segment of most human and avian influenza viruses encode a second open-reading frame, PB1-F2. Via its interaction with mitochondrial proteins, PB1-F2 is believed to induce apoptosis 25 , enhance inflammation in mice and synergistically enhance the severity of secondary bacterial infections 26 .

Underlying immunocompromising factors or other diseases associated with increased risk for seasonal influenza are not commonly observed in patients with H5N1 disease. Thus, exposure to virus is necessary but is not a sufficient explanation for the observed epidemiology -other factors such as host genetic or immunological susceptibility or unusual routes of exposure are likely to play a role. Interestingly, H5N1 disease is less common in those over 40 years of age, an observation not explainable by the population age-structure or risk behaviour of affected populations 35, 36 . It is possible that cumulative hetero-subtypic immunity through repeated exposure to seasonal influenza may contribute to this age distribution. There is increasing evidence of antigenic epitopes that can mediate such cross-subtype immunity 37 .",

While this observation may be skewed by the selective investigation and diagnosis of patients who are more severely ill, there is no doubt that H5N1 disease in humans is overall associated with a markedly worse clinical outcome. A proportion of patients appear to have a milder disease presentation and these have been most notably reported in Hong Kong in 1997 (clade 0 virus) and more recently in Egypt (clade 2.2 virus) although even then, overall case mortality was >30%. In these two instances, young children had a milder disease presentation than adults 30, 38 . Whether this reflects increased case detection of milder cases in Hong Kong and Egypt or is a reflection of differences of virulence of different virus clades remains unclear. Patients with severe H5N1 disease have a rapidly progressive primary viral pneumonia associated with leukopenia (a finding also documented in the 1918 outbreak), gastro-intestinal symptoms and mild liver and renal dysfunction 15, 38 . The key autopsy findings are diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, i.e. the pathology of ARDS. Patchy interstitial infiltrates and pulmonary congestion is seen with varying degrees of haemorrhage ( Figure 1A ). The cellular infiltrate predominantly comprises of macrophages, neutrophils and activated lymphocytes ( Figure 1B ). Apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells is noted. Lymphocyte depletion is seen in the spleen and lymph nodes [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .",

While H5N1 virus appears to have the ability to spread beyond the respiratory tract, i.e. the virus can be isolated from the faeces 45 , serum 46,47 and very rarely from the central nervous system 46 , the lung pathology (ARDS) remains the major cause of mortality in human H5N1 disease. However, at the time of death, immune-histochemistry rarely shows overwhelming viral infection of the lungs and often very few if any virus infected cells are demonstrable 39, 41, 43, 44 . Since the limited autopsy data arises from patients who have died after prolonged periods of illness and assisted ventilation, the paucity of virus at autopsy does not of course preclude a major role for virus in initiating the lung injury.",

The alveolar epithelial cells express \u03b1 2-3 SA-Gal-GlcNAc while the upper respiratory tract has a paucity of these receptors. In contrast the human upper respiratory tract (nasopharynx, trachea) has an abundance of \u03b1 2-6 SA which preferentially binds the human seasonal influenza viruses H3N2 and H1N1. They also have O-linked \u03b1 2-3 SA which bind both avian and human influenza viruses [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . Furthermore, within the lung, H5N1 viruses preferentially attach to type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages. These findings led to the hypothesis that the lung pathology of H5N1 is caused by differential targeting of the virus to the lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, if the H5N1 virus is unable to replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract, it would explain why the virus is not readily transmitted to humans. However, there are some key observations that do not fit in with such a hypothesis. H5N1 viruses readily infect ex vivo cultures of upper respiratory tissues e.g. nasopharyngeal and tonsillar tissue 54 and immunohistochemistry for viral antigen and virus receptors in tracheal tissue of a patient with fatal H5N1 disease demonstrated that the virus can be found infecting tracheal epithelium 58 . Conversely, some seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 can readily infect the ex vivo cultures of lung (lower respiratory tissues) 53,54 but they are not commonly associated with severe lung pathology. There are also patients with H5N 1 disease who had mild self-limited upper respiratory illness without lower respiratory involvement. As part of rapid diagnostic procedures, influenza antigen was detected in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells from nasopharyngeal aspirates of these patients suggesting that H5N1 virus can in fact infect the upper respiratory tract 38 . While tissue tropism may well play a role, we contend that other mechanisms also contribute to the unusual severity of human H5N1 disease (discussed below).",

The most appropriate animal model for use depends on the purpose, i.e. vaccine evaluation, antiviral testing, transmission or pathogenesis. The most challenging of these is the choice of an animal model to study transmission and pathogenesis. While guinea-pigs are being used to study virus transmission, influenza causes minimal pathology or disease in this animal model 65 . Relevant features of available animal models for the study of pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 and human seasonal influenza are summarised in the table. Ferrets most closely mimic humans in the distribution of putative SA receptors in the respiratory tract while mice and macaques do not 57 . For instance, ferrets can be infected with human influenza viruses without prior adaptation while mice typically cannot. There is however a paucity of immunological reagents and genomic data on ferrets, an issue that currently imposes major limitations on the detailed immunological study of this animal model. While mice have been widely used for studies on influenza virulence and pathogenesis, particularly because of the availability of reagents, inbred mouse strains and mice with defined gene defects still have a number of caveats. Firstly, there is sometimes poor correlation between lethality of viruses for mice and for ferrets 63 . For instance, some H5N1 viruses are highly neurotropic in mice and fatality is therefore more likely related to virus dissemination to the brain rather than related to the lung pathology. Many investigators use H5N1 viruses with rapid lethality for mice because they provide a clear end-point, although such lethality may in fact reflect neurotropism rather than the ARDS-like lung pathology which is the cause of death in humans.",

Mice with defects in genes for the IL-1 receptor, the type I interferons IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 had a worse outcome following H5N1 infection suggesting that these pathways are protective 67, 73 . Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 deficient mice as well as mice treated with anti-TNF antibody had less weight loss following infection when compared with controls although survival was no different 67 . This may reflect a role for TNF receptor signalling in the pathogenesis of influenza-induced lung disease although mortality (which in these mice was associated with neuro-invasion) was unaffected. In a study where a number of immunomodulators currently in clinical use were investigated together with an antiviral agent (zanamivir) in a mouse model of H5N1 disease, zanamivir in combination with a COX2 inhibitor (Celecoxib) and mesalazine led to improved survival when compared to the antiviral alone 74 . The hyper-induction of chemokines by H5N1 virus led to the accumulation of a particular subset of DC described as TNF-\u03b1/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) producing DCs (tipDCs) in the lung airways. These tipDCs are important for proliferation of influenza specific CD8 + T-cells in the lung. CCR2 defective mice who lack this chemokine attraction have markedly reduced accumulation of tipDCs in the lung leading to delayed virus clearance. However, modulation of the tipDC trafficking by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) agonist pioglitazone moderated the deleterious effects of tipDC recruitment without losing its beneficial effects of cytotoxic T cell recruitment 75 .",

As these observations reflect the outcome of multiple cycles of virus replication and associated tissue damage in the human or animal, it is not possible to differentiate whether the aberrant host responses are merely secondary to the enhanced pathology caused by H5N1 virus, whether they reflect increased cumulative viral load, or whether there are intrinsic differences between viruses in their ability to induce these host responses. including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, IL-1 \u03b2, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCl5 and CCXL10 from primary human macrophages 68, 81 . Similarly, H5N1 viruses differentially upregulated CXCL10, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CCL5, and IFN-\u03b2 from alveolar epithelial cells 82 . Thus, many of the cytokines and chemokines found to be differentially elevated in the sera of patients with H5N1 disease (compared to seasonal influenza) were also more strongly induced in vitro using comparable challenge doses of the virus (Figure 3 ). This differential gene expression occurred within the first few hours of virus infection and was dependent on infection with live virus. Furthermore, increasing the infecting dose of H1N1 (low cytokine phenotype) virus to 10 times that of H5N1 virus could still not result in a comparable host response.",

The primary mediators directly and differentially induced by H5N1 virus are TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1, the other mediators being the result of autocrine and paracrine responses 83 (Figure 3 ). The induction of the primary mediators occurred, at least in part, by the virus differentially activating interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and p38MAPK pathways 83, 84 . In an intact organ, there are interactions between different cell types and we have tried to mimic such interactions between virus infected macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells in vitro 85 . The virus-free supernatants of H5N1infected macrophages induce mediator cascades in alveolar epithelial cells and these lead to amplification and broadening of the host responses. For example, TNF-\u03b1 is not induced directly by the H5N1 virus infection of alveolar epithelial cells but virus-free supernatants from H5N1 infected macrophages do. COX-2 was found to be a key controller of this amplifying cytokine cascade and COX2 inhibitors could dampen these amplifying mediator cascades 85 (summarised in Figures 3 and 4) . Some of these cytokines (e.g. IFNs) are expected to have an antiviral effect (see above), but the overall effects of these cytokine cascades may well contribute to pathogenesis. While we had reported that H5N1 more strongly induced type 1 IFNs from alveolar epithelial cells 82 , others reported that H5N1 induced a weaker type 1 IFN response from differentiated bronchial epithelium than seasonal influenza H3N2 86 .",

For example, in Indonesia, while earlier commencement of oseltamivir treatment is associated with improved survival, even treatment within the first 4 days of disease is not a guarantee of survival and is still associated with a 42% mortality 94 . Alternative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. The first step towards this is to understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the lung pathology associated with human H5N1 disease and how it differs from seasonal influenza. Here, we have reviewed data that suggests that the innate immune response may be both friend and foe. This points to possibilities of novel therapeutic interventions that deserve further investigation. Preliminary data suggests that the differences in host responses induced by H5N1 appear to be similar to those of seasonal H1N1, albeit of greater intensity 83 but more systematic studies using gene expression profiling and proteomic studies to address this question are warranted. It is relevant to also investigate whether biomarkers that provide early indication of a poor prognosis can be identified to guide such immunomodulatory interventions. It is particularly interesting that targeting some signalling pathways that are associated with inflammation (e.g. the RAF-MEK-ERK kinase cascade, NF-\u03baB activation) can also block viral replication 95 . Thus, such therapeutic interventions may potentially combine antiviral effects with beneficial immunomodulatory effects.",

This enhances the opportunity for reassortments between the pandemic virus and other viruses including with H5N1 virus which has been reported in pigs 96 . The internal gene \"cassette\" of these swine viruses from which the H1N1 pandemic viruses arises appears to have unusual propensity for reassortment. Given the unprecedented severity of H5N1 disease and its continued threat to human health, it is important that we better understand the biological basis of its virulence and pathogenesis. This would also provide an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of ALI and ARDS caused by influenza as well as other causes. ALI and ADRS arising from many diverse causes continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality 97 . Mechanisms that may contribute to the pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Arrows indicate the factors contributing to outcome. Higher levels of viral replication, the binding of the H5N1 virus to receptors in alveolar epithelial cells, and the spread of the virus beyond the respiratory tract could all contribute to the severity of human H5N1 disease. In this review, we argue that the H5N1 virus differentially activates host responses in macrophages and primary lung alveolar epithelia and such differences in host responses contribute to disease pathogenesis. This figure is modified from reference 3. Cytokine and chemokine induction in macrophages infected with H5N1 virus. Virus infection activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and the p38-MAPK signaling pathways as well as others. Activation of these pathways leads to the expression of primary mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), the type I interferons (IFN)-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 which in turn trigger release of other cytokines and chemokines through autocrine and paracrine effects. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in regulating cytokine expression within the infected cell, as well as those activated by secreted mediators in adjacent uninfected cells. (2), which trigger autocrine and paracrine proinflammatory cascades involving both cell types and infected as well as uninfected cells. These host responses are more potently induced by H5N1 virus compared to seasonal influenza viruses. Some of these cytokines (e.g. interferons) are expected to have an antiviral effect, but the overall effects of these cytokine cascades may well contribute to pathogenesis.
