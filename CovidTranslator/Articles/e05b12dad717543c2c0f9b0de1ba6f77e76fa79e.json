Next, a miR-192 agomir was transfected into the OS cell line MG-63 to upregulate miR-192. The effects of miR-192 overexpression were then investigated by examining cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11 belongs to a family of nine or more highly homologous Zn 2+ -endopeptidases. It was demonstrated that the mRNA and protein expression of MMP-11 were upregulated in OS tissues compared with non-tumor tissues (P<0.05). MMP-11 was predicted by TargetScan and miRanda as a miR-192 target, which was confirmed by western blotting and dual-luciferase assays. Finally, it was demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-192 was able to downregulate MMP-11 expression and reduce proliferation, migration and invasion, and promote apoptosis in OS cells. Together, these data indicate that miR-192 may be a tumor suppressor that inhibits the progression and invasion of OS by targeting MMP-11. Therefore, miR-192 may be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of OS.",

However, OS has a substantially poorer prognosis when associated with fatal lung metastases. The 5-year survival rate of patients with OS metastases is <20% despite the use of aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy (4), or even when physicians resort to radical surgery (5) . As current efforts have failed to obtain impressive achievements in treatment outcomes and quality of life, it is imperative to find new treatment and diagnostic strategies for early OS, discover new therapeutic targets and develop new techniques to improve disease prognosis.",

Each miRNA can regulate hundreds of protein-encoding genes and vice versa, as each structural gene can be a target for multiple miRNAs (8) . The incorporation of miRNAs in the study of tumor progression and pathogenesis has reached new levels in recent years for various malignancies, including breast, colon, bladder, pancreatic and lung cancer (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, the field of miRNAs in OS is still in its infancy.

Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in diverse biological processes, including tumorigenesis (28, 29) . Each miRNA can control hundreds of gene targets, indicating that miRNAs may function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes via cellular pathways (8) . A recent study reported that some miRNAs are dysregulated in cancer. The aberrant expression of these miRNAs may promote tumor proliferation or repress tumor development (30) . Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the mechanism of miRNA-mediated OS development. The present study focused on the roles of miRNA-192 in OS. The dysregulation of miRNA-192 has been detected in man types of cancer. Specifically, miR-192 overexpression has been shown to induce apoptosis in bladder cancer cells, suggesting that it may be a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer by regulating cell cycle progression (31) . Upregulated miR-192 has also been demonstrated to inhibit the progression and metastases of colon cancer (32) . Moreover, elevated miR-192 expression has been reported to cause cell growth arrest in breast cancer cells (33) . However, it has been reported that miR-192 is overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (34) , esophageal cancer (35) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (36) . To date, it is unclear whether the downregulation or upregulation of miR-192 is associated with the development of OS.",

Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-192 was able to decrease proliferation and promote apoptosis in MG63 cells. It was also determined that the upregulation of miR-192 was able to suppress the migration and invasion of MG63 cells. Therefore, miR-192 could be an inhibitor of OS metastasis. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-192 is a tumor suppressor in OS. Using a combination of two publicly available bioinformatic algorithms, putative miR-192 binding sites in the 3'-UTR of MMP-11 were detected. Moreover, it was detected that MMP-11 expression was higher in OS tissues compared with matched adjacent normal tissues, and MMP-11 expression was also increased in MG63 cells compared with the normal human osteoblastic cell line hFOB1.19.",

MMP-11 also has a potential correlation with poor prognosis in OS (22) . Notably, an inverse correlation between miR-192 expression and MMP-11 in MG63 cells was detected. To further investigate whether MMP-11 is a downstream miR-192 target, dual-luciferase assays were conducted. The overexpression of miR-192 led to a significant decrease in luciferase reporter activity in cells that express wild-type but not mutant MMP-11 3'-UTR constructs. Therefore, MMP-11 may be a direct target of miR-192. These data indicate that the overexpression of miR-192 inhibits the progression and invasion of OS by downregulating MMP-11 expression via directly targeting its 3'UTR. In the future, this could be the basis for anti-metastatic therapy for OS. In light of the principle of miRNA-target recognition, a specific miRNA could have >100 targets (38) . Therefore, the complex molecular network of miR-192 remains an enormous subject for future investigation.",

Accordingly, we propose that both miR-192 and MMP-11 could be promising candidate targets for treating OS.",
