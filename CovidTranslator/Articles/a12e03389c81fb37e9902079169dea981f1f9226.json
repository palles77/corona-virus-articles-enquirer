We agree with Tierney and Gerrity's 2 characterization of the problem as failure to disclose the original author(s) and pertinent financial relationships. We also applaud the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME) for recommending that journal editors expand their Information for Authors to indicate that medical writers can be legitimate contributors to manuscripts and to encourage disclosure of their roles and affiliations. 3 Put into practice, this recommendation empowers biomedical communicators to become part of the solution.",

More than 5,000 biomedical communicators belong to the American Medical Writers Association (AMWA), an educational organization founded in 1940 to promote excellence in biomedical communication and to recommend principles of conduct for its members. The first principle in AMWA's Code of Ethics 4 states, ''Biomedical communicators should recognize and observe statutes and regulations pertaining to the materials they write, edit, or otherwise develop.'' Principle 4 states, in part, ''[Biomedical communicators] should refuse . . . assignments that require unethical or questionable practices.'' AMWA's recently adopted position statement recommends acknowledgment of substantial contributions to scientific publications with disclosure of pertinent relationships. 5 Biomedical communicators who contribute substantially to manuscripts should join the author-writer team at the inception of the project. Under these circumstances, biomedical communicators can encourage authors to adhere to ethical standards while following a logical process-beginning with identifying the main message to be conveyed, targeting the audience, and determining the most appropriate journal for conveying the message.",

We plan to expand this survey to assess the experience of more biomedical communicators, the frequency of practices such as those described by Fugh-Berman, 1 In Reply:-If most medical writers, or biomedical communicators, were hired by bad writers with good ideas, I would have no problem with the suggestions made by Dr. Hamilton et al. However, many medical writers are hired by pharmaceutical companies (or indirectly through medical education companies) to flesh out manuscripts prescripted by pharmaceutical companies as part of a marketing strategy.",

''To the Editor:-We were moved by the honest account by Rambaldini et al. 1 of the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on medical house staff in the university hospitals in Toronto. As medical educationists faced with the same catastrophic outbreak in Singapore, we identified with the reported struggles and barriers to traditional clinical teaching, and fully agreed with the authors' call for new strategies to deal with future health threats.In line with the authors' suggestion that more creative educational mechanisms be developed, we would like to share our experience with an innovative method employed to teach cardiac auscultation during the SARS crisis in Singapore. 2 Clinicians in full personal protective equipment used electronic stethoscopes to record the heart sounds of patients with echocardiographically proven heart disease at the 6 classically taught precordial positions for cardiac examination. Cardiologists validated the sounds, which were then used to teach students in simulated ''bedside'' sessions. Students took turns to act as ''patient'' and ''auscultator.'' While the auscultator simulated the clinical examination routine on his/her ''patient,'' the soundtrack corresponding to each area of auscultation was played through the stethoscope earpieces. Students thus learned to examine real people while picking up real auscultatory signs, a process similar to actual patient encounters. Peer-to-peer teaching helped to overcome the shortage of teaching staff. Soundtracks could be downloaded, stored, ''beamed'' from one stethoscope to another, and reused to teach large groups of students, thus maximizing the limited clinical material available. Objective outcome measures and subjective feedback proved that the method was effective and well-received by the students. Since then, we have applied this simulated learning method in retraining doctors in basic skill competency during continuing medical education. 3 Although this new teaching method was developed in response to the SARS crisis, we have seen that there are applications in modern everyday medicine as well. With patients becoming less tolerant of multiple examinations, illustrative clinical signs becoming rarer with effective disease prevention strategies, and teaching resources growing increasingly limited, more innovative educational strategies are clearly needed. Rather than waiting for the next public health crisis, we believe that the time to develop and apply these new teaching methods is now. We thus join voices with the authors in urging educationists everywhere to think creatively in developing new teaching methods, and to start doing so without delay.-Carolyn SP Lam, MBBS, Crystal-Jing Yeo, Pak-Yean Cheong, MBBS, Khek-Yu Ho, MD, National University of Singapore, Singapore.",
