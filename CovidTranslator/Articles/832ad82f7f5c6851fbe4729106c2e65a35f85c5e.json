            "text": "The increasing threat of pathogenic virus outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian flu, and the more recent swine flu have spurred the public's concerns in regards to the health related issues and protection methods against viral aerosols (CDRF, 2006) . Filters are one of the most commonly used devices to remove viral aerosols because of their affordability, ease of application, and effectiveness (Fisher et al., 2009) . Filtration efficiency is determined by several mechanisms such as interception, impaction, diffusion, gravity, and electrostatic attraction, depending on fiber density, diameter, filter thickness, and other factors (Hinds, 1999) . However, these mechanisms are only related to the physical capture of viruses onto the substrate. Conventional filters still allow these collected viruses to infect others if reaerosolized through the respiratory processes of exhalation, sneezing, or coughing, or as a fomite (CDRF, 2006) . Filters can be modified by incorporating chemicals as antimicrobial agents to inactivate viruses (Gabbay et al., 2006; Silver et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2009 ). Aldehydes such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are also well known antimicrobial agents, as they are highly reactive molecules which are able to combine with proteins and nucleic acids of microbes by crosslinking and alkylation. Nevertheless, their use as incorporated agents has been limited in the air filtration field because of the toxic effects if small aldehyde compounds were to be released and inhaled (Mcdonnell & Russell, 1999) . For this reason, polymeric dialdehydes, such as dialdehyde starch (DAS), are promising alternatives. They not only react with hydroxyl, amino, imino, and sulfurhydryl functional groups, resulting in the inactivation of viruses, but they also show very low toxicity (Mcdonnell & Russell, 1999; Radley, 1976) . Our preliminary study demonstrated that a DAS aqueous suspension acted as an effective biocide against MS2 bacteriophage, PRD1 bacteriophage, and poliovirus. Thus, it is of great interest to employ DAS to modify filters for effective and affordable protection against viral aerosols.",

MS2 aerosol was generated by a six-jet Collison nebulizer (Model CN25, BGI Inc.) that had a virus titer of 10 8 -10 9 PFU/mL at a flow rate of 7 Lpm with a pressure of 6 psi. The flow rate through the system was controlled by a rotameter, which was calibrated with a primary flow meter (DryCal s DC-Lite, Bio International Co.). The flow containing MS2 aerosol joined the other flow rate of 7 Lpm, passed through a humidifier for RH control, and then proceeded towards a 2.3-L glass mixing chamber. Thereafter, the flow was split and each flow then reached the corresponding filtration unit at a flow rate of 3 Lpm. This flow rate corresponds to the face velocity of 14.2 cm/s, which is a standard value for respirator filtration testing (NIOSH, 2005) . The excess air passed through a separate line and bypassed the test filter. The viral aerosols that penetrated the test filter (F\u00bc22 mm) were collected by BioSamplers (SKC Corp.) containing 15 mL of sterile DI water at a total flow rate of 5.5 Lpm for 30 min for the experimental line. The reason for using a lower flow rate than the standard 12.5 Lpm is to avoid significant reaserosolization of MS2 at high flow rate (Riemenschneider et al., 2010 ). An empty filter holder without a filter was used for the control line. The collected sample was assayed with Escherichia coli as a host by the single layer method (EPA, 1984) . The viable removal efficiency (VRE) was determined by comparing the PFUs from the experimental and control BioSamplers:",

Consideration of the extraction efficiency and the collection efficiency of the BioSampler was not necessary for this relative value, RS. The pressure drop across the filter was measured by a Magnehelic gauge to evaluate filter performance using quality factor (QF), a useful criterion for comparing filter performance of different filter types and thicknesses. This value is defined as (Hinds, 1999) QF \u00bc \u00c0ln\u00f01\u00c0VRE\u00de DP",

Also, when CFs were subjected to the wrist action shaker, untreated filters were broken after 15 min whereas treated filters remained intact. This is presumably because of crosslinking or entanglement of DAS with the cellulose. SEM images of untreated and treated filters with different DAS suspensions, as shown in Fig. 2 , confirm this hypothesis. CFs are composed of main fibers and fibrillates of small diameter. CCF contains small amounts of fibrillates, whereas FCF has numerous fibrillates. DAS was crosslinked with fibrillates of CFs, resulting in the increase of fibrillate diameter (Fig. 2D-I) . Granular DAS was also observed on the surface of the main fibers at high DAS concentration (Fig. 2D, H-I) . In contrast, DAS was merely deposited on the fiber surface of PF with insignificant change in fiber diameter due to the lack of reaction between hydrophobic propylene filters and DAS. The difference in materials yields differences in the impact of the DAS treatment, as will be demonstrated in the following section.",

Fig. 3A and B shows that the VRE and QF of the test filters as a function of concentration of DAS suspension. For the PF, the DAS treatment did not change the fiber diameter of the filters, resulting in insignificant change in VRE. Hence, there was no significant change in QF. For the CF, the treatment did not cause discernible impact on the VRE although the treatment reduced air resistance as pressure drop decreased. Accordingly, an increase in the QF was observed. The QFs of untreated and 4% DAS treated CCFs were 0.77 and 1.46 kpa \u00c0 1 and those of FCFs were 0.25 and 1.85 kpa \u00c0 1 , respectively.

DAS treatments have different impacts on filtration efficiency depending on filter materials. The treatment reduces air resistance in cellulose filters, resulting in lower pressure drop while having no significant impact on removal efficiency. These factors combine to yield an improved quality factor for cellulose filter. Meanwhile, there is no difference in quality factor for treated propylene filters. Nevertheless, the biocidal effect is clearly exhibited for all treated filters. Compared to other decontamination methods, the DAS treatment does not require additional energy sources and facilities (e.g., microwave, IR, and UV irradiation) and it does not release toxic chemicals (e.g., iodine treated filter). Therefore, the treated filters can be adopted for wide applications such as in health care facilities and at pandemic events. ",
