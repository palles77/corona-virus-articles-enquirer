The reaction is performed in one step in a single tube at 65 C for 45 min, with hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) dye added prior to amplification. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was approximately 10 2 EID 50/50 ml TCoV genome, and no crossreaction with other avian viruses was observed. The assay was evaluated further in tissue suspensions prepared from the ileum and ileumecaecal junctions of infected turkey embryos; 100% of these samples were positive in the RT-LAMP assay. All individual feces samples collected in the field were considered positive by both conventional RT-PCR and RT-LAMP. In conclusion, RT-LAMP with HNB dye was shown to be a sensitive, simple assay for the rapid diagnosis of TCoV infection, either directly from feces or in association with virus isolation methods.",

It is a pleomorphic enveloped virus with a size of approximately 80e160 nm in diameter and 20 nm-long clubshaped projections around virions. Its genome is linear, positive sense, single stranded RNA. The major structural proteins of TCoV include the glycoprotein spike (S 1 and S 2 ), a membrane (M) protein and a nucleocapsid (N) protein. The S protein is highly variable and the spike gene structure remains unclear, despite several genetic studies of TCoV having been conducted [5] . The amino terminal S 1 region of several coronaviruses contains receptor binding domains, whereas the S 2 region consists of a transmembrane domain that induces cell fusion and pathogenesis [6] . In addition, the S 2 gene is more conserved and shares only 40% of similarity with other coronaviruses such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [5, 6] .",

This TCoV strain was successfully propagated in embryonated turkey eggs supplied for a commercial hatchery [8] . Viral purification, RNA isolation and subsequent RT-PCR amplification were carried out using a pooled intestinal tissue suspension of infected intestines harvested from inoculated embryos, as in our previous study [8] . The virus titration was performed with 10-fold dilutions into five groups of five 28-day-old embryonated turkey eggs. The 50% embryos infectious dose (EID 50 ) was calculated according to Reed and Muench (1938) by analyzing macroscopic lesions in the intestinal tract [7, 8] . Intestinal tissues infected at a 2.0 \u00c2 10 4 EID 50 titer were homogenized in a 2-fold volume of minimal essential medium (GIBCO-BRL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), clarified by centrifugation at 2500 \u00c2 g for 20 min and filtered consecutively through 0.45-mm and 0.22-mm membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The presence of TCoV in the filtrate was confirmed using RT-PCR of a portion of the 3 0 UTR (untranslated) region [2] . Extensive testing of the inoculums excluded the presence of pathogens other than TCoV.",

All primers were designed with PrimerExplorer V.4, a software program for LAMP primer design (http://primerexplorer.jp/e/). The names and sequences of each primer are shown in Table 1 . To test the specificity of the established RT-LAMP, other viruses, including Newcastle disease virus (NDV, La Sota vaccine strain), turkey astrovirus (TAstV-1, GenBank accession number FJ178641) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV-M41 strain) were tested.

A positive amplification was indicated by a color change from violet to sky blue, as shown in Fig. 1A , and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C) . The detection limit of RT-LAMP and conventional RT-PCR is illustrated in Fig. 1B and C. Ten-fold serial dilution of TCoV demonstrated that RT-LAMP is able to detect 10 2 EID 50/50 ml , whereas the RT-PCR is able to detect 10 4 EID 50/50 ml titrated virus. IFA analysis indicated that 20 out of 25 tested samples were positive, whereas 100% of samples tested positive by RT-LAMP. A number of 25 ileumecaecal junction samples from the 25 infected embryos 13 were scored as negative for TCoV infection with IFA (Table 2 ). These false negative results were likely observed because viral antigens are not normally expressed on the cell surface until after viral RNA transcription [6] . When conventional RT-PCR and RT-LAMP performed in the same samples were directly compared, 14 ileumecaecal junction samples negative by RT-PCR were negative by IFA and 5 samples were considered negative with conventional RT-PCR (Table 3) . This phenomenon could be explained by properties of DNA polymerization offered by the use of four primers in LAMP assay which can amplify few amounts of viral RNA into cDNA [11] . Probably those negative samples generated in conventional RT-PCR were collected from low viral infection samples with titers lower than 10 4 EID 50/50 ml and not visualized on agarose gel electrophoresis system [12] . All negative samples collected from non-infected embryos were negative in all tests (data not shown). A perfect correlation was found between conventional RT-PCR and RT-LAMP results for feces collected in the field (Table 3) . No false positives (i.e., cross-reaction) of TCoV RT-LAMP were detected in samples of other avian viruses (Fig. 1B) .",

One of the most attractive features of this RT-LAMP assay is that the results can be observed and determined by hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) dye-mediated visualization using the naked eye; furthermore, tubes do not have to be opened after amplification. The results reported here indicate that this diagnostic technique could reliably be used to detect TCoV in field samples and may be used to effectively monitor infections, as demonstrated previously for realtime RT-PCR for the same target gene [4] . Although no quantitative data was generated in this study, RT-LAMP associated with spectrophotometric evaluation can yield absolute values, as demonstrated previously [12e14].",

In summary, the RT-LAMP assay is novel, simple, visual and provides a sensitive and specific tool for the rapid detection and diagnosis of TCoV in simply equipped laboratories and under field conditions in developing countries. Its ease of use will support epidemiological programs in the turkey industry. ",

A series of 10-fold dilutions ranging from 1 to 10 4 EID 50/50 ml of titrated virus was used as templates.RT-LAMP was performed in a one-step reaction with 6 primers in a 25 ml mixture containing 2 ml genomic RNA, 40 pmol (each) primers FIB and BIP, 5 pmol (each) primers F3 and B3 and 3 pmol of each primers F2 and B2, 1 U Thermo-X reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen\u00d4) and 8 U Bst DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs), with corresponding buffers. Amplification was carried out at 64 C for 45 min or 75 min and terminated by incubation at 80 C for 2 min.
