            "text": "After decades fighting French, Japanese, and American occupations, Vietnam established a rigid, single-party communist dictatorship in the 1970s that in many respects imitated that of China, with strict socialist controls and severe political repression. However, gradually, starting in the 1980s a series of steps, such as the doi moi reforms, led to a quasimarket-based economy. It also began to loosen the government's grip and open the country to the world economy, including joining ASEAN and the World Trade Organization in 2006. Its economy is still largely agricultural, but it has developed burgeoning industries in garments and food production. While a relatively poor country, its population of 90 million is well educated.",

There are only five Internet service providers (ISPs) in the country, including Vietnam Data Communications, a subsidiary of the state monopoly, Vietnam Post and Telecommunications. Mobile phone usage is common and constitutes one of the main avenues for accessing the Internet. It is also one of the world's most severe Internet censors. E-participation was rated at a mere 0.1053, indicating a society not yet positioned to reap the fruits of the Internet. Five ISPs serve the country.",

Early efforts were supported by the French government (Thao and Trong, 2015) . At the behest of the e-government steering board, ministerial websites were completed, but not until 2003. In 2002, it formed the Ministry of Post and Telematics to oversee IT development in the country. In 2010, the government passed Act Number 43, which promoted the shift of government services online. The state has attempted to create an e-customs facility, with limited success.",

            "text": "At the simplest level of e-government-web pages that provide information-Vietnam has made several gains. All 64 provinces developed their own websites, to various degrees of functionality. Virtually all public offices are connected to the Vietnam Wide Area Network (CPNet), built in 1997 in the LotusNotes environment, which supports e-mail, searches of journals, and exchanges of documents. Vietnamese e-government is most evident in cities such as Hanoi, Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), and Danang (Tsai et al., 2009) . It is there the government has taken tentative steps toward online registration and licensing. Hanoi allows online registration of births and deaths. Hanoi and Saigon introduced the \"tale of two cities\" project (Desai and Magalhaes, 2001) , portals that inform potential investors of how to start a business there. However, many government websites are not user-friendly, are not updated sufficiently frequently, and provide few opportunities for user feedback. They are thus \"supply driven\" rather than user driven. In 2006, the government launched the official Vietnam government information portal (www.vietnam.gov.vn) using Oracle technology. The Vietnam digital government webpage (http://egov.org.vn/2016/en/homepage/) is relatively sophisticated, with announcements of conferences and seminars. Despite considerable investment, e-government in Vietnam has fallen far below popular expectations (Khanh et al., 2015) . Vietnam has suffered its share of disappointments in e-government. Its first major foray was a disaster. In 2001, Vietnam launched the widely heralded Project 112, at a cost of $220 million, to integrate government software across the country, train personnel in IT, and link government agencies through a shared network of linked databases. However, the project never really got off the ground and never confronted the country's severe digital divide between cities and rural areas. Project 112 disappointed its government backers (Obi and Hai, 2010) and collapsed in 2007 when several high-ranking administrators were arrested on charges of receiving kickbacks from software companies (AmCham Vietnam, n.d.) . In 2012, the project was discontinued. To be fair, however, failures of e-government projects are not uncommon in the developing world (Dada, 2006) , where they are particularly painful given the limited resources at their disposal.",

            "text": "Vietnam's lack of success in e-government reflects, among other things, the country's relatively low rate of Internet penetration; for many people in rural areas, IT is simply unaffordable. Nguyen and Shauder (2007) concluded that vast swaths of the populations were simply unprepared to use the Internet effectively. Large shares of the population have never heard of e-government or used available services (Obi and Hai, 2010) . As Vi\u1ec7t Nam News (2013) notes, \"Government online services fail because of problems with internet connections, font errors, documents and systems, lack of online announcements, and feedback and support.\" IT standards are often not the same, limiting interoperability. Moreover, the government generated insufficient technically skilled personnel, inadequate funding, poor protection of intellectual property, and lacked clear, decisive leadership. Many policies focused on implementing hardware without due consideration of staff and users' needs. But Vietnam's problems have another, deeper cause. In totalitarian states, governments fear the potentially democratizing effects of the Internet and the access to media channels outside of officially sanctioned ones that it offers. Vietnam's Leninist state has long pursued a rigid path of Internet censorship (Pierre, 2000) , or what is sometimes called the \"Bamboo Firewall\" in homage to China. Surborg (2008) notes that the government uses its censorship tools selectively to maximize its flexibility in its control of cyberspace. The Ministry of Public Security rigorously monitors web pages for content it deems offensive. Despite the liberalizing efforts known as doi moi, the Vietnamese Communist Party keeps a firm grip on cybertraffic, particularly Internet sites considered to be \"offensive to Vietnamese culture\" (Human Rights Watch, 2002) . The state uses a complex system of firewalls, access controls, and strenuously encouraged self-censorship. Websites that express views on human rights, religion, or the views of the Vietnamese diaspora are routinely blocked, as are those that carry Radio Free Asia. In 2003, the government lashed out at Reporters Without Borders after the organization listed the country as one of the world's 15 worst censors of the Internet. The country's sole ISP with a license for international connections, Vietnam Data Communications, is a subsidiary of the government telecommunications monopoly. Domestic content providers must obtain special licenses from the Ministry of the Interior and lease connections from the state-owned Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Corporation. E-mail is regularly monitored by searches for key words. Vietnam has imprisoned those who dare to use the Internet to speak out against the government: bloggers such as Phan Thanh Hai, Paulus L\u00ea S\u01a1n, Lu Van Bay, Pham Minh Hoang, and Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n H\u1ea3i have been repeatedly arrested, all for calling for democracy. A 2010 law requires owners of cybercafes to install software that monitors users' actions. Owners who permit searches of unauthorized websites by their clients face fines of five million dong, roughly US$330 (Kalathil and Boas, 2003) .",

In Vientiane, it erected a national e-government service center to coordinate digital communications among agencies, and founded 16 provincial e-government service centers throughout the land. The National Bank of Laos has slowly moved toward e-banking. The National University of Laos began distance-learning courses for students in remote villages. The Ministry of Public Security implemented a national electronic citizen ID card system. The Lao Decide Info project has online databases for census, housing, agriculture, and mining and hydropower. It has initiated steps for interactive websites, although this capacity is largely lacking to date. In 2013, the government allowed businesses to submit applications for operational and trade licenses online. The same year, the Lao Ministry of Post and Telecommunication's National Internet Center launched the Lao Computer Emergency Response Team, a unit focused on battling cybercrime. Laos also joined the Greater Mekong Sub-region Information Superhighway Network, which also includes China, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar, and whose purpose is to promote IT adoption in the region. It also established cooperative agreements with India and South Korea toward that end.",

Its e-government initiatives date back to 1994, when the Sub-Committee of Promotion of Utilization of Information Technology in Public Organization began to push for the computerization of public offices and the promotion of IT training for employees. Soon thereafter the state promoted the use of electronic data interchange among public agencies. In 1996, the government announced its first National IT Policy, called IT2000, which accelerated development of the government's information network (a high speed virtual private network), the SchoolNet program to introduce the Internet into schools, and the legal infrastructure that makes digital transactions safe, private, and secure. Relevant legislation included an Electronic Transactions Bill, an Electronic Signature Bill, and a Computer Crimes Bill. In 2001, this effort was updated as IT2010, or \"IT Policy 2.0,\" the country's vision of a future information-based society. On the heels of ASEAN's 2000 declaration that IT and e-government were regional priorities, the e-Thailand program was born, which emphasized rapid response, rural coverage, and round-the-clock service. Since 2007, the e-government interoperability framework has guided the slow initiation of digital communications among different government agencies (Kawtrakul et al., 2011; Funilkul et al., 2011) .",

As part of this project, the next year, 1997, saw the dawn of formal e-government legislation, known simply as e-government, as one of the MSC flagships, which revolved around several interlocking goals: generic office environment, to promote a collaborative, paperless public workspace; electronic procurement through three modules (the enterprise-wide information management, communications, and collaboration systems); the project monitoring system, to coordinate managerial functions of numerous statutory bodies on diverse public projects and to facilitate the exchange of best practices; the Human Resource Management information system, to enhance government employee functionality; the Electronic Labour Exchange renamed JobsMalaysia, launched in 1999, which is an online job matching site used by 35,000 people annually; e-Syariah, to upgrade services in the 102 Syariah courts and the effectiveness of the Islamic Affairs Department; and e-Land, to make the National Land Administration more accurate. e-Land includes the e-Tanah project of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, begun as a pilot project in Penang, which oversees land registration and sales to facilitate land transactions (Kaliannan et al., 2007) . e-Syariah, begun in 2002, became fully functional in 2005 and centers on a portal that allows attorneys, prosecutors, plaintiffs, and defendants to file suits and affidavits online, get hearing dates, and view court decisions; current plans call for a future ability to allow plaintiffs and respondents to meet via teleconferencing.",

The full-fledged e-Services initiative, begun in 2002 and also known as eKL, was implemented in phases following a three-month long pilot program in the urbanized Klang Valley. The initiative adopted the widely used \"one government, many agencies\" principle to integrate public services, including online delivery of drivers' licenses, court summons, and tax and utility bill payments. The Rilek services program offers Internet access to the public with touch screens at information kiosks, where they can pay fees, fines, and utility bills with a credit card. An experimental mobile e-government service, the MySMS initiative, used a single number, 15,888 (Thunibat et al., 2011) . The Agriculture Ministry sends short messaging service (SMS) notes to farmers to warn them of rising water levels and impending floods. The state also offered several telehealth programs, often aimed at rural areas, including: the Lifetime Health Plan (advice for healthy living); Mass Customized Personal Health Information & Education (health information tailored to people's demographic specifics); Continuous Medical Education (which provides health information to health care professionals); and Teleconsultation, which allows citizens to speak with professionals online. All of these are accessible at hospitals and 41 public health clinics. Other successful examples include its Road Transport Department (e-insurance, e-road tax, and e-license renewal), immigration (e-passport and e-visa), the Royal Malaysian Police (e-summons), and the Kuala Lumpur City Council (e-complaints) (Abdullah and Kaliannan, 2006) .",

Security includes a 16-digit PIN number; when security loopholes were discovered, the IRB moved quickly to close them. Although the initial use fell below expectations, in 2009, a total of 1.25 million people filed taxes digitally. Surveys indicated that the most likely users were young, female members of the Chinese minority (Ambali, 2009) . In an effort to increase participation, the IRB added a new feature to the e-filing system, e-bayaran or e-payment, in which taxes can be paid through banks. The online system was shown to have lower error rates than paper submissions and has raised compliance levels.",

It has received significant amounts of scholarly attention (Kaliannan et al., 2007; Siddiquee, 2008; Sambasivan et al., 2010; Aman and Kasimin, 2011; Hui et al., 2011) , more than any other aspect of Malaysia's e-government. It comprises a novel and highly successful form of e-procurement aimed largely at small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and has lowered the state's operational and administrative costs. Given the size of the government's procurements-more than 23 billion ringgit in 2007 ($5.7 billion)-this is no small issue. More than 120,000 firms are registered. The system reduced the time between application for registration and approval of supplies from 36 days to 20 days (Siddiquee, 2005) . However, firms must purchase a smart card to use it, train employees, and periodically upgrade their software. Nonetheless, e-procurement of government contracts has steadily become the norm (Santhanamery and Ramayah, 2014), even if growth rates did not meet expectations.",

Public awareness of e-government remains low. Bureaucratic in-fighting was another obstacle, which diminished trust, teamwork, and knowledge sharing. While government websites in Malaysia are generally functional, they occasionally suffer from broken links and accessibility problems; these are compounded at the state level (Isa et al., 2011) . Lack of trust among its residents has slowed enthusiasm for e-government programs (Lean et al., 2009) . However, Malaysia resorted to the use of public-private partnerships to overcome these barriers (Kaliannan et al., 2010) , in which private firms invested in public projects but the state retained responsibility for the delivery of core services. One example is the aforementioned e-Perolehan procurement program. Finally, mobile e-government is hampered in part because many state web pages are not designed to accommodate them well (Thunibat et al., 2011) .",

Its e-government initiatives began as early as 1980, with the launch of the Civil Service Computerisation Programme and then, in 1981, of the National Computer Board. Its progress then advanced in several waves, including the National IT Plan (1986-91), the IT2000 Master Plan (1992-99), and Infocomm (or Singapore) 21, which began in 2000 with a series of forums and surveys; it proceeded to accelerate the development of government web pages and e-government in the hopes of creating an \"intelligent island\" (Ke and Wei, 2004). In the 1990s, the Singapore One (One Network for Everyone) project, launched in 1997, created the world's first nationwide broadband network, and it reaches 99% of the population. In 2000, it unveiled its E-government Action Plan, budgeting $932 million over the next three years to implement it (funds are approved through the Ministry of Finance). Since 2002, e-government initiatives have been coordinated by the IDA. The government initiated a Remaking Singapore project in 2002 that solicited citizen input as to how to improve competitiveness and the functioning of the state. In 2006, the iGAP 2010 initiative, funded with $2 billion, coordinated planning for the next five years. In 2011, it started the E-government Master Plan, with the explicit aim of providing \"government-with-you\" (Baum and Mahizhnan, 2014). The most recent initiative is eGov 2015. The system is highly centralized: all of the government's e-services follow identical security, electronic payment, and data exchange procedures. Today, more than 1700 government services can be delivered online (Ke and Wei, 2004; Ha, 2013); essentially, \"any public services that can be delivered online must be digitized\" (Ha and Coghill, 2006, p. 107) . The central government portal (www.ecitizen.gov.sg) offers access to a wide array of services. The state also invested heavily in security measures to protect online transactions from hacking, identity theft, and cyberterrorism. In 1998, in a bid to increase IT and Internet literacy, the government organized a five-day mass hands-on training event called Surf@Stadium.",

            "text": "Singapore's e-government system works well for several reasons. First, it possessed strong, proactive leadership with a clear vision of the need for e-government, with well-specified goals and sufficient financial resources. From the beginning, its designs were inclusive and citizen-centered (Ha, 2013). The stated objectives of e-government are CARE: Courtesy, Accessibility, Responsiveness, and Effectiveness (Ha and Coghill, 2006). Cultivating trust was central to its success (Srivastava and Teo, 2009). Engagement of users-state employees, firms, and the public-was essential (Pan and Chan, 2008) . Pan et al. (2006) note that the Singapore IDA invested heavily in training programs and cultivated considerable goodwill. The government's promotional campaign featured \"Q-busting,\" i.e., the prevention of queues at government offices through e-government. As Sriramesh and Rivera-Sanchez (2006) point out, Singapore is also well educated and has a corporatist, communitarian culture. Also, the state was careful to identify potential stakeholders in designing and implementing it (Tan et al., 2005) , including public servants, corporations, academics, and labor unions. The state solicited input from a variety of interests to gain a holistic interorganizational perspective, helping to align stakeholders with the state's objectives. Managers were encouraged to facilitate collaborative learning, and to hold meetings where best practices could be exchanged. When implementing e-government, it held a prolonged public relations campaign, including IT literacy education and a series of online fairs. However, there are faults in this system too: Singapore lacks privacy laws for electronic transactions (Ha, 2013), although many public websites state privacy policies. Notably, the state rejected a proposed Freedom of Information Act.",

In 1998 e-filing began, allowing Singaporeans (even those overseas) to pay through the Internet. The government's investments in the requisite technology were recouped within five years. The digital system not only reduced paperwork, but necessitated fewer staff as well. Large corporations and government bureaus were encouraged to submit information about their employees to expedite the process. It includes a system that allows taxpayers to communicate with the tax authority and with one another, including questions and complaints; this feedback is often used in upgrading and improving the system. In 2008, 87% of potential tax returns were filed this way (Dorasamy et al., 2010) . One motivation for filing taxes electronically is that filers get immediate acknowledgment.",

Under the e-Business Industry Development Scheme, it introduced subsidies to encourage firms to enhance their e-commerce capacities. Subsequently, the government passed the Cyber-Trader Act, the Electronic Transactions Act, and the Compute Misuse Act. Other laws protected entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, start-ups, and patent holders. In 1997, it established Tradenet, an electronic clearing house that seamlessly unites firms, the Customs Department, the Trade Development Board, and air and seaport authorities (Teo et al., 1997) . The active participation of the island's business community, which anticipated the benefits, was central to the success of these initiatives (Chan and Al-Hawamdeh, 2002; Tung and Rieck, 2005) . Because multiple stakeholders were included in the design and implementation of e-government initiatives, such measures enjoy widespread trust among different segments of the population (Lim et al., 2012) ; as with e-commerce, trust is central to the effective adoption of e-government, and trust, like all social constructions, varies greatly over time and space. The portal, gebiz.gov.sg, allows firms to conduct many functions online, including electronic registration, tax payment, submission of contracts, and license renewal, update, or termination. It has cut red tape considerably; the time needed to incorporate a company dropped from two days to two hours (Sriramesh and Rivera-Sanchez, 2006) . Similarly, the One-Stop Public Entertainment Licensing Center cut processing times \"from 6 to 8 weeks to about 2 weeks\" (Ha and Coghill, 2006, p. 113) .

Its primary vehicle in this regard is the Singapore Media Development Authority (MDA), which has regulated Internet content under the guise of monitoring a broadcasting service since 1996. All ISPs are automatically licensed by the Singapore Broadcasting Authority, which routes all Internet connections through government proxy servers. Licensees are required to comply with the 1996 Internet Code of Practice, which includes a definition of \"prohibited material,\" i.e., content that it deems \"objectionable on the grounds of public interest, public morality, public order, public security, national harmony, or is otherwise prohibited by applicable Singapore laws\" (OpenNet Initiative, 2007, p. 3) . Moreover, \"the government has at times taken unannounced strolls through several thousand personal computers with internet connections, subsequently explaining such actions as sweeping for viruses or pornography\" (Kalathil and Boas, 2003, p. 78) . Self-censorship is also encouraged as a means to stifle political expression. The use of lawsuits under stringent defamation laws is also common, and can reach well beyond the island's perimeter. For example, Jiahoa Chen, a Singaporean student at the University of Illinois, was forced to shut down his caustic.soda blog under threat from the government-run Agency for Science, Technology, and Research. As a result of these measures, Singapore's government has achieved near-total control over its Internet environment with minimal loss of political legitimacy.",

E-government got a very late start in Indonesia, where it was introduced by Presidential Instruction No. 6 in 2001, which stressed the need for affordable IT services, strategies for their development (e.g., training), and offered guidelines to local governments for its adoption. This was followed by Instruction No. 3 in 2003, which emphasized the construction of the necessary technical and administrative infrastructure. A coordinating body consisted of government officials, academics, representatives of the business community, and members of social organizations. By the end of the year, hundreds of government agencies had opened their own websites, although maintenance and updating have been a longstanding problem. In 2004, the Department of Communication and Informatics followed up with guidelines for quality standards, project implementation, and a blueprint to implement them. In 2006, Presidential Decree Number 20 established the Council of National Information and Communication Technology (Detiknas). Subsequently e-government unrolled in several phases, including pilot projects and an e-government task force. Many of these efforts were developed in collaboration with the Indonesia Telecommunications Company (PT Telkom).",

The Indonesian Digital Library Network (http://idln.itb.ac.id), which began in 2001, is a collaborative effort of local universities, national government agencies, and foreign donors. One of the most popular websites is Lapor (Layanan Aspirasi dan Pengaduan Online Rakyat), initiated by President Susilo Bambang Yudhyono in 2011, which allows citizens to report instances of corruption or infrastructure problems via SMS (lapor.go.id) and receives 1000 reports per day (Lukman, 2013); a team then checks the complaint of wrongdoing for accuracy (at least in theory) and notifies the complainant of actions taken. More recently, President Joko Widodo repeatedly vowed to implement an e-government system that would strengthen monitoring, improve accountability, and reduce corruption. His administration did establish a one-stop integrated service to obtain investment permits and licensing, computerized school exams to prevent cheating, and e-blusukan, which enables the president to engage in contact with citizens via teleconferences. The e-Livestock program registers individual cows from birth to slaughter. As in many countries, Indonesia moved in 2008 toward e-procurement for government contracts (Sistem Pengadaan Secara Elektronik), a system overseen by the Government Good/ Service Procurement Policy Organization. The state also introduced electronic tax filing in 2014, although it has not enjoyed much popularity. It has experimented with the Sistanas system that would allow e-balloting. It created an Instanet with 18 institutional members to expedite information among agencies.",

Surabaya, the second-largest city, has initiated an e-procurement system, reducing its costs by roughly 25%. Jakarta introduced two location-based e-government apps: Qlue, which allow citizens to file geotagged complaints with the municipal government (and has been downloaded 80,000 times), and Crop, used by ground-level officials who respond to the closest complaint. Jakarta has also used social media to inform citizens; it opened Twitter and Facebook accounts in 2012. The Yogjakarta government started the Jogja Cyber Province Initiative to manage IT implementation in government offices. In a study of Yogyakarta, Tangerang, and Kutai Kartanegara, Nurmandi and Kim (2015) identified human capital as the central factor in the implementation of successful municipal e-procurement programs. The Takalar (Sulawesi) and east Kutai (Kalimantan) districts moved some services online in 2000, reducing the time needed to obtain permits and identification cards. Kutai Timur had the best of 400 local government websites in the country (Rose, 2004) , with a one-stop portal (http://www.kutaitimur.go.id.utaitimur.go.id) called SIMTAP (Information Management System of One-Stop Services), where 12 public services, including identity cards and building permits, may be obtained. Investment permits can be obtained in 36 min. Similarly, the new city of Gorontalo took admirable steps to enhance transparency with its web pages. All too often, however, these initiatives are underfunded and lack sufficient human resources and leadership. For example, only 19% of localities use geographic information systems.",

The Department of Budget and Management's Bottom-up Budgeting interactive website allows for citizen input into the process. The state has also started distance-learning programs, although these are aimed primarily at basic education (Ramos et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "The Philippines has often been called the \"text messaging capital of the world,\" with 100 million texts sent daily, generating a higher number per capita than any other country. Given the popularity of text messaging there, it would be odd if the government did not avail itself of the medium. Indeed, the country in some respects appears poised to skip e-government altogether and leapfrog directly into m-government, becoming something of a world leader in the process. Text messaging has long played a key role in Filipino cultural and political life: in 2001, President Estrada was deposed in an SMS-organized campaign he called a \"coup de text,\" when just 15% of Filipinos had mobile phones. With the introduction of the TXTGMA service in 2001, Filipinos all over the world were able to bring their concerns directly to President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Today, half of all government agencies use SMS to keep in contact with the public. The Civil Service Commission launched an SMS service called TextCSC that allows citizens to complain about corrupt workers and slow service delivery; it is the most widely used public SMS service in the country. The Bureau of Internal Revenue launched an electronic payment confirmation scheme using SMS messages on mobile phones to guard against \"fixers\" who issue fake receipts to taxpayers. Known as e-broadcasting, the system provides taxpayers with direct confirmation within 38 h that their payment has been received by authorized banks. The Department of the Interior has a centralized emergency and crime reporting service called Text 117. Citizens can voice their concerns and questions to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources through the DENR@YourService project. When the state floated a proposed tax on text messages, the public responded with a virtual NGO called TxtPower, which led a successful campaign to defeat it. Starting in 2002, citizens have been able to help enforce antipollution laws by reporting smoke-belching public buses and other vehicles via SMS or online (http://www.bantayusok.com) due to the Bantay Usok project of the Land Transportation Office; it receives about 6900 SMS messages per month. Oversees Filipino workers can seek assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs via the SMS service TXTDFA, and the Center for Migrant Advocacy initiated an SOS SMS program for overseas workers facing emergencies. Starting in 2002, the National Police allowed citizens to report suspicious activities and crimes by criminals and police officers via SMS. The national JobHunt program sends SMS messages to applicants when a relevant position becomes open. The Bureau of Internal Revenue offers a raffle to selected texters. In other respects, however, the country has to play catch-up: for example, there is no system for m-payments.",

In 1998, the University of the Philippines established the National Telemedicine Center, which manages referrals from 40 doctors in remote areas around the country (Marcelo, 2009 ). Some of its major accomplishments include the Community Health Information Tracking System (CHITS), founded in 2004, a disease surveillance system used in 12 community health centers; the E-Learning for Health Project, which offers a series of short videos on issues such as poisons, strokes, tuberculosis, and influenza; the BuddyWorks Community Partnership, which established broadband connections in remote sites so that difficult medical cases could be referred to experts; and the SMS Telemedicine Project, which allows doctors and patients to communicate via mobile phone messages.",

Set to run for three years, it was seen as a means of enhancing efficiency and generating revenues. At its end, in 2005, essentially all local governments had web pages, although many were not updated regularly and few offered interactive services. Siar's (2005) analysis showed that most were lacking substantial information, including relevant contact information, what services they offered, or online forms. Only a tiny handful attempted online management of property records or business permits and licenses. However, Bulacan Province was touted as the leading local government in this regard, and was rewarded with a Galing Pook award in 2002 for its efforts to promote digital inputs from citizens.",

Virtually all public schools have Internet access via the Gearing up Internet Literacy and Access for Students (GILAS) program.

Internet use is growing rapidly throughout the region. In general, the more open and democratic the government is, the more likely it is to use e-government, although the causality in this case may be bidirectional. These observations indicate that e-government is tailored to specific national and cultural contexts, and serve as a warning against simplistic \"one-size-fits-all\" interpretations.",
