            "text": "A mutation shown to cause resistance to chloramphenicol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was mapped to the central loop in domain V of the yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA. The mutant 21S rRNA has a base pair exchange from U26~ 7 (corresponding to U2504 in Escherichia coli) to C26v7, which significantly reduces rightward frameshifting at a UU UUU UCC A site in a + 1 U mutant. There is evidence to suggest that this reduction also applies to leftward frameshifting at the same site in a-1 U mutant. The mutation did not increase the rate of misreading of a number of mitochondrial missense, nonsense or frameshift (of both signs) mutations, and did not adversely affect the synthesis of wild-type mitochondrial gene products. It is suggested here that ribosomes bearing either the C2677 mutation or its wild-type allele may behave identically during normal decoding and only differ at sites where a ribosomal stall, by permitting non-standard decoding, differentially affects the normal interaction of tRNAs with the chloramphenicol resistant domain V. Chloramphenicol-resistant mutations mapping at two other sites in domain V are described. These mutations had no effect on frameshifting.",

Haid Institut fiir Genetik und Mikrobiologie, Lehrstuhl fiir Genetik, Universit~it Mtinchen, Maria Ward Str. la, 80638 Mfinchen, Germany S. Thompson Department of Genetics, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland this phenomenon is obligatory for the synthesis of particular proteins (reviewed by Atkins et al. 1990; Hatfield et al. 1992) . Two systems of frameshifting to nearby bases appear to operate. In one, frameshifting is governed by specific shift sites (see Brierley et al. 1992 and references therein) and secondary structure configurations in the mRNA sequence (Brierley et al. 1989; Chamorro et al. 1992; Gesteland et al. 1992; ; ten Dam et al. 1990) , the latter serving (through structural perturbations of the ribosome?) as brakes, to impede ribosomal progression (Tu et al., 1992) and ultimately precipitating tRNA uncoupling and recoupling at the shift site (reviewed in Atkins and Gesteland 1994) . In the second system ribosomal frameshifting is precipitated merely by low tRNA availability at the shift site (Kawakami et al. 1993) , without a prior requirement for tRNA uncoupling . In a third system (Huang et al. 1988; Le et al. 1993) frameshifting is achieved by ribosomal hopping over longer distances. Excluding some complicating aspects of hopping , it is clear that attempts to modulate the rate of frameshifting at the ribosomal level involve either seeking to change the postulated perturbation centre (if any) or manipulating the flexibility of the ribosome at the shift site, i.e. interfering with its in-built capacity for inaccurate decoding. In this paper we describe a mutation in the 21S mitochondrial rRNA of yeast, which alters the ribosome's tolerance of inaccurate decoding. The observation that diploid cell growth and levels of wild-type mitochondrial gene products are normal in the strain suggests that the mutant rRNA may function in the same way as the wild-type in orthodox decoding, but result in greater observed accuracy than in the wildtype when anomalous decoding is facilitated.",

Translation leads to a TAA stop (in DNA) in both mutants, generating protein fragments of molecular weight t2,500 and 9,600 for M5631 and M5701, respectively, compared to the full-sized subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase of Mr 33,500.

These mutations often simultaneously affect frameshifting, missense and terminator read-through in the direction of increased accuracy (Melan~on et al. 1992) or decreased fidelity (O'Connor and Dahlberg, 1993) . Instances of altered accuracy that have been documented for both the 16S rRNA and 23S RNA include: alterations at positions G517 (O'Connor et at. 1992) , C726 (Prescott and Dahlberg, 1990) , C~,69 Noller 199t) in 16S rRNA and at U2555 (O'Connor and Dahlberg 1993) in 23S rRNA, all of which severely reduce accuracy. On the other hand, increased accuracy is observed with mutations at G25 s3 (Saarma and Remme 1982) and G2661 (Metan~on et al. 1992 of Escherichia coli 23S rRNA, and when C is altered to G in the yeast mitochondrial 15S rRNA at the position equivalent to Ct4o9 in the E. coli 16S rRNA (Weiss-Brummer and Htittenhofer 1989 )~ The antibiotic chloramphenicol interacts with the central loop of domain V of the 23S rRNA (Moazed and Noller t987) and interferes with peptide bond formation (Monro and Vazquez 1967; Celma et at. 1970; Ballesta and Lazaro 1990) , possibly by preventing tRNA 3' ends from being correcty juxtaposed at the A and P sites. Mutants that are resistant to this antibiotic appear exclusively to alter the peptidyltransferase center of 23S rRNA (see Vester and Garret 1988) and we reasoned that in so doing such mutations might also alter the proper interaction oftRNAs at the A-and P-sites and result in fidelity problems. We therefore investigated the effect of this type of mutation on frameshifting and here describe one chloramphenicol-resistant mutant which, in specific diploids, significantly reduces frameshifting rates in a COXH reporter gene, without having any apparent effect on the general level of translation.",

This condition is generated when a respiratory-competent cell is required to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol. The strain under investigation, 777-3A-M5631 containing a mutant reporter gene COXII (cytochrome c oxidase subunit II), exhibits leaky rather than no growth on glycerol at 30\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C. No growth is observed at 23\u00b0C (Table 3 ). In addition, 777-3A-M5631 and its parental strain 777-3A (COXII \u00f7) both carry the recessive nuclear opl mutation (pet-) and therefore Kotylak and Slonimski (1977) ; 2, Weiss-Brummer et al.

All these mutants are respiratory-deficient when grown on a medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol chloramphenicol-resistant mutations could not be directly isolated in either strain. Instead mitochondria of the strain 777-3A were transferred via cytoduction to the rho \u00b0 strain KL-0. KL-0 possesses the wild-type nuclear allele for respiratory function (PET + ) and has the complementary mating type to 777-3A-M5631. The resulting new strain was named KL14-777-3A (Sakai and Weiss-Brummer, unpublished) . Cells of the strain KL14-777-3A (106) were plated on selective media containing the antibiotic.

In KL14-777-3A[C3-C5] crosses some unexpected effects were obtained, which however, were shown not to be correlated with the C R mutation (data not shown). Thus only one chloramphenicol-resistant mutation examined in this work, the C1 allele, shows fidelity effects detectable as altered leakiness. The C2 and C3-C5 alleles have no effect.

This reduction in leakiness of the COXII mutation in diploids, in the presence of the C1 allele, could be one manifestation of a general reduction in the rate of translation of all mitochondrial genes, rather than being specifically related to frameshifting. These alternative possibilities are distinguishable by studying the effect of the C R mutation on the production of other mitochondrial proteins, and by examination of growth rate in the presence of the normal COXII gene. The growth rates of two diploid recombinant colonies (from the cross 777-3A-M5631 x KL14-777-3A-C1), both revertant for the + 1 frameshift mutation M5631 and therefore respiratory competent, were found to be indistinguishable when measured under conditions of mitochondrial translation. One recombinant colony carried 1~ C336, the other the wild-type C s allele. If the resistance mutation had a general deleterious effect on translation, one would, on the contrary, have expected cells derived from the chloramphenicolresistant colony to display a comparatively diminished growth rate. Several other independent derivatives were also tested, and in each case the result indicated that, in contrast to the haploid situation, the growth of the diploid carrying C~36 resembles that of wild-type.",

Lanes 1 (a representative of 'reduced leaky' strains) and 2 (a leaky strain) were from the cross KL14-777-3A-C1 x 777-3A -M5631; the wild-type strain in lane 3 was from the cross KL-0 x 777-3A. Only subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase is affected. Lane 2 shows the product of the leaky COXtI reporter gene; the level is estimated as 20% of that of the wild-type in lane 3. This level of leakiness is reduced by approximately 50% in the chloramphenicol-resistant background (lane 1). These values (average of three representatives each of'reduced leaky' or leaky strains) were obtained by scanning the autoradiogram using the stable, ribosomal vart protein as an internal standard for the determination of the amount of subunit II for each lane. In lane 1, subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase is also reduced in amount. Previous results (unpublished data) show that it is unlikely that this reduction arises from the chloramphenicol-resistant phenotype. In many other COXII mutants, where subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase is defective, a similar reduction in the level of subunit I protein is frequently observed the same location as 777-3A-M563t (Fig. 1) . Its leakiness was clearly reduced (Table 3 ) when, following crosses with the C~36-containing strain, C R recombinants were compared for growth to the C s recombinants. This level of reduction was not quantified in a protein gel analysis on account of the low degree of leakiness of the mutant strain 777-3A-M5701 in the first place. The above tests are not extensive, mainly due to the unavailability of other yeast leaky mitochon-",

C~36 maps to position Uz677, a highly conserved base (equivalent to U25o4 in E. coli, Fig. 3 ) in the central loop of domain V. Some lines of evidence suggest that the central loop forms part of the peptidyltransferase center (Vester and Garrett 1988; Noller 1991; reviewed in Noller 1993) . Apart from the present work, the alteration of one other base, G2583 (of E. coil) in the domain V central loop has been shown to affect fidelity. Substitutions at this position (tested under in vitro conditions only) increased accuracy in the order G < A < U < C (Saarma and Remme 1992) . The exact mechanisms of action of position 2583 mutations are unknown, but chemical probing studies of Moazed and Noller (1989) implicate both of the bases U2584 and U2585 adjacent to the G2ss3 site as important in P-site 3' tRNA protection. The only other mutations of 21S/23S rRNA known to affect fidelity (O'Connor and Dahlberg 1993; Melanqon et al. 1992 ) are outside of the central loop of domain V.",

The mutation M5631 is a + U addition to a wild-type U5 run, generating the m R N A sequence A U U U U U U C C A (Fig. 1) . The observed leakiness resulting from this mutation is most probably not primarily based on the intrinsic 'slipperiness' of the U repeat sequence present, but rather is related to the sequence U C C A immediately downstream of the first U5 run. Mutations M4577 and M4931, like M5631, result from + U additions at sequences containing five or six reiterated Us (Fig. 5 ) but such strains are not leaky for growth on glycerol (Weiss-Brummer et al. 1984 ). On the other hand the -1 frameshift mutant 777-3A-M5701 has only 4 Us in tandem, but is leaky (Fig. 1) . These facts dissociate leakiness from mutations at U runs per se.",

The extent of growth on a medium containing a nonfermentable carbon source is designated by ( + ), + or + + (*see Figure 2B , lane2 and 3 for the extent of + + ) in comparison with wild-type growth to which + + + + is assigned. No growth is designated by -. Sakai, 1989) . Therefore, during decoding at the sequence AUU UUU UCC A in M5631, the only possible competitive mispairing at the A-site UCC with the potential to produce a fruitfully frameshifted product would be with the tRNAW\u00b0(3'GGU5'). Other mispairings can be discounted by the proline conservation constraint. Secondly, in the wild-type mitochondrial protein gene UCC is only used once and its cognate tRNA (3'AGU5') may decode it inefficiently. This may mean that the rarely utilized codon UCC may trigger a ribosomal stall (see Sorensen et al. 1989; Dix et al. 1990; Varenne et al. 1982 for example of rare codons resulting in poor translatability and ribosomal pausing). On these bases, three models are presented in Table  4 to account for frameshifting in 777-3A-M5631. Model A is reminiscent of + 1 frameshifting in the yeast transposable element Ty3 ) and model B of + 1 frameshifting in the yeast transposable elements Tyl and Ty2 (Belcourt and Farabaugh 1990) .

It generates a CAG glutamine codon in the sequence AUU UUC CAG; this codon is also (extremely) rare (4 instances in the entire set of mitochondrial genes). The proline conservation constraint suggests that tRNAPr\u00b0(3'GGU5') must read its own cognate codon in the -1 frame UU UUC CAG, resumably tbllowing its rejection and a stall at the CAG in the A-site (see model D). Experiments by Kolor et al. (1993) and Gallant and Lindsley (1992) strongly suggest that a leftward shifted entry to the A-site is only successful when the P-site tRNA can recouple to the left also and allow access to its codon's wobble base. Retroviral frameshift sites (e.g. Jacks et al. 1988; see Hatfield et al. 1992; Brierley et al. 1992 ) provide striking examples of this forced P-site tRNA recoupling. It is therefore more likely that a double (the potential for which exists), rather than a single, shift is involved in M5701 C~36 significantly affects the level of the frameshifted product of COXII but has no detectable effect on the wild-type products of other mitochondrial genes (Fig. 4) . This suggests that the altered C~36 domain V may only behave differently from its wild-type counterpart when an abnormality in decoding triggers a ribosomal stall or promotes mispairing.

Although it is formally possible that C R ribosomes could reduce frameshifting by accepting a near-cognate tRNA at the A-site more often than C s ribosomes (i.e. affect proofreading), the location of C~36 within domain V raises some difficulties in this regard. According to Moazed and Noller (1989) the EF-Tu ternary complex shields the interaction between tRNA and domain V bases up to the time of its (EF-Tu.GDP) dissociation from the ribosome.

One possibility that was discussed for + 1 frameshifting involved abnormal dissociation of P-site tRNA and its subsequent re-engagement one base to the right before filling of the A-site and transpeptidation (Model B, Table 4 ). In considering this model and its variant (Model C, Table 4 ), it is conceivable that the mutation in C3R36 could be silent with respect to normal P-site dissociation but 'active' when dissociation is premature, i.e. when dissociation occurs before off-loading of the nascent peptide. A conformationalty altered binding of peptide-bearing P-site tRNA, could, by effectively suppressing premature dissociation, also reduce the level of the leaky product. An altered tRNA binding effect of C~36 at the P-site might also adversely influence a leftward shift in -1 frameshifting in mutant M5701 (Model D, Table 4 , right column) in a manner analogous to that just described.
