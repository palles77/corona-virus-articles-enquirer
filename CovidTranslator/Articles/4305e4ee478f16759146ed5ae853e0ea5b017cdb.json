[1] [2] [3] Globally, AIVs occasionally cause infection in humans and their livestock, such as poultry, pigs, and other wild animals with harmful outcomes. Some of the highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) strains, in particular H5N1, have occasionally infected humans with high mortality rates exceeding 60%. [4] [5] [6] As a consequence of high rates of antigenic drift and shift, reassortant strains and novel mutants have emerged, and some have acquired the ability to cross-species barriers and become pathogenic in their new hosts. 7 Efficacy and practicality of timely vaccinations remain problematic in the worldwide effort to combat influenza, 8, 9 and strains resistant to drugs (e.g., amantadine) often appear. 10 Thus far, there are four antiviral agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat influenza virus infection, which can be divided to two groups. One is comprised of the M2 ion-channel inhibitors, such as amantadine and rimantadine, which interfere with viral uncoating within the host cells. The M2 inhibitors are effective only against influenza virus A and are associated with several toxic effects on the digestive and nervous systems. 11 The other group, consisting of such drugs as oseltamivir and zanamivir, are neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. 9, 10, 12 Although oseltamivir and zanamivir have high antiviral activities, they have low bioavailability and adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. 13, 14 In light of these issues, new classes of drugs are urgently needed for suitable long-term use.",

The bulbs of Lycoris radiata have long been used as a traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of laryngeal complications, furuncles, carbuncles, and suppurative wounds. [15] [16] [17] Previous phytochemical and pharmacological studies revealed that the major chemical constituents of this plant are alkaloids, which have demonstrated antiviral, antitumor, antimalarial, and acetylcholinesterase-inhibitory activities. 12, 18, 19 To obtain the specific anti-AIV compounds, the total alkaloids from L. radiata were separated and purified using chromatographic methods by our group. Fifteen alkaloids were isolated and identified on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis. Among them, four compounds lycorine (AA1), hippeastrine (AA2), hemanthamine (AA3), and 11hydroxy vittatine (AA4) exhibited inhibitory activities against an H5N1 strain 178 in Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. In the current study, we investigated the anti-AIV activities of these Amaryllidaceae alkaloids and the mode of action of the active compounds. Infection experiments in vitro indicated that AA1 and AA3 could inhibit nuclear-to-cytoplasm export of the RNP complex in single-round and multi-round replication assays, which could be a possible mechanism of their antiviral activities. Therefore, these compounds may be developed as anti-influenza drug candidates.",

Here, we found that these compounds could inhibit influenza virus replication, which was more effective when added earlier during infection. While none of these compounds affected the activity of the RNP complex, which is important to viral generation and replication, their migration from nuclear to cytoplasm was blocked in single and multiple replications with the treatment of AA3, and the compound AA1 delayed the export of NP protein from nuclear. Thus, the results suggested that the viral inhibitory activity of the compounds involved inhibiting the export of the RNP complex. There are many factors (such as Hsc70 protein, NF-jB, and caspase pathway) that can inhibit export of the RNP complex from nuclear to cytoplasm, and the underlying mechanism will require further study. In addition, the chemical structures of the four compounds that exhibited antiviral activity and compound AA2 were lower than other three compounds.",

AA1 and AA3 in particular showed strong activities against influenza A virus in vitro. They did not target the outer membrane proteins, nor the activity of the RNP complex and internalization. Instead, they retained their antiviral activity by block in vRNP nuclear export, and AA1 retained its antiviral activity for up to 24 h, while AA3 retained this for even longer. The mode of action of AA1 and AA3 on viruses in the host cell observed in this study implies that they may potentially be developed as antiviral agents against influenza A virus. Further studies are needed to explore the viral and cellular protein \u2044 pathway targets of these compounds.",
