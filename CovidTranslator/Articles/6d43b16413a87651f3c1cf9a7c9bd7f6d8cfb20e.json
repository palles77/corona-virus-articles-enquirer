In this study, genomic RNA were extracted from TGEV designated HYM-09 isolated from dog naturally infected with TGEV. The nucleocapsid (N) gene of HYM-09 was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pMD18-T vector. The N gene cDNA was sequenced and encompassed an open reading frame of 1,149 nucleotides, encoding a 382-amino acids protein. Sequence analyses of the N genes were performed, including homologous comparison, phylogenetic tree analysis and residue substitution analysis. The results showed that there existed some unique mutations in the HYM-09 isolate N gene, but HYM-09 N gene shared over 96 % homologous identities compared with 12 TGEV reference strains derived from other regions or countries respectively. The phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the HYM-09 branched into the most strains group. This study shows that the nucleotide sequence analysis can form a base or further study on the mutation trend of non-porcine TGEV.",

The epizootic form of the disease has mortality as high as 100 % in pigs younger than 2 weeks of age and infected preweaning piglets may die of severe dehydration [7, 13] . Occurrences of TGE have become more sporadic. The disease is still reported on an occasional basis from parts of Europe, North America and Asia.

In this report, the N gene was cloned by RT-PCR from a recently isolated TGEV (HYM-09) from dogs in Heilongjiang province, China. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of the N gene were compared with other 12 references strains derived from different regions and/or countries.

Fluorescent antibody test showed that specific cytoplasmic fluorescence was found in ST cells using FITC-labeled Rabbit Anti-Swine IgG Antibody (Bipec Biopharma, USA).

Statistical significance of groups within phylogenetic trees was evaluated using the bootstrap method with 1,000 replications (Fig. 2) .
