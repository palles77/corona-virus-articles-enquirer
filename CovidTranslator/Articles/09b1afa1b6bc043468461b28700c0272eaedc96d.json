This study examines the influences of highway proximity and traffic on office values in Hong Kong using hedonic price analysis on 13,670 transactions around highway interchanges for 2002-2013. Our hedonic regressions, controlling for unobservable district effects and incorporating instrumental variables, reveal that the associations of highway proximity and traffic with office prices appear to exhibit mixed results across Hong Kong's three territorial divisions. The negative externalities generated by excess traffic cancel out the accessibility benefits of highway proximity on Hong Kong Island, where densely built-up office districts are suited for amenity-sensitive knowledge businesses that tend to create value-added services through face-to-face communications. By contrast, highway proximity uplifts the value of office properties with lower transportation costs and higher market accessibility in Kowloon and the New Territories, where spacious workplaces near hub-port and logistics facilities are advantageous for mobility-driven trade and transportation businesses that tend to increase value-added throughput in cross-border relations with mainland China. These territorial findings are of particular importance for progressive policymakers to deploy the strategic applications of underground bypasses, greenway creation, interchange improvement, congestion charges, and smart technology to manage mobility and alleviate disamenity, accompanied by supportive public transit services and adaptive land-use rezoning, in the dynamic and complex process of deindustrialization.",

            "text": "With flows of people and goods concentrated in major cities, which offer greater competitive advantages than minor cities and peripheral territories in globalization, there is growing demand for urban mobility worldwide (Gwilliam, 2002; OECD, 2006; UNDP, 2009) . Of various solutions, multibillion-dollar investments in transportation infrastructure have become increasingly critical for the economic competitiveness of heavily congested cities of the present and future. Controversially, while engineering-led, high-capacity highway systems have long been adopted by policymakers to enhance mobility and mitigate congestion in the industrializing and industrialized world, the political paradigm of urban transportation in post-industrial societies has shifted progressively toward environmental sustainability (Altshuler and Luberoff, 2003; Dimitriou, 2006; Ewing, 1996) . This alternative approach typically calls for much greater resource allocations to public transit and non-motorized transportation systems, along with land use and climate change measures worldwide (Banister, 2011; Cervero, 1998; Newman and Kenworthy, 1999) . However, scholarly debates and balanced views should maintain focus on the economic and environmental importance of both railway and highway investments in establishing strategic territorial development. While a large body of empirical research already presents the accessibility impacts of railway infrastructure and services on residential preferences mostly in developed economies (e.g., Debrezion et al., 2007; Higgins and Kanaroglou, 2016; Mohammad et al., 2013) , this study reexamines the influences of highway infrastructure and traffic on office values, particularly in the industrial restructuring process from manufacturing to knowledge-and service-based economies in Asia.",

Both urban theorists and development practitioners are increasingly witnessing the dense co-location of a wide array of transnational corporate headquarters and advanced producer services to conduct face-to-face meetings, share knowledge-intensive resources, and form productive business clusters in the central locations of major cities or so-called \"global cities\" (Sassen, 2001) . By contrast, manufacturing activities largely move offshore and increase international trade flows to and from strategic industrial zones, characterized by low tax rates, low wage labor, and low-cost logistical advantages, in mainland China and other Asian countries (Farole and Akinci, 2011) . World-class transportation infrastructure is designed to meet such dynamic and complex flow patterns of people and goods in emerging global cities and strategic industrial zones. However, little is known about the changing importance of highway investments in the new territorial divisions of industries observed across the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.",

In particular, Hong Kong is globally known for its successful integration of railway investment and territorial development through government land leasing. The city's extremely dense urbanization and high economic productivity could not have been sustained without intensive railway investments over the past decades (Cervero and Murakami, 2009; Loo et al., 2010) . However, Hong Kong's transit-oriented development model, which has been introduced globally, is only one side of the coin. Hong Kong also has the world's most heavily used roadway system. In support of Hong Kong's rapid throughput growth, the government has projected a series of massive highway capacity provisions since the early 1990s and by 2013, had developed an extensive highway network of about 242 km with 62 interchanges across its administrative territories, comprising 26 km with 14 interchanges on Hong Kong Island, 49 km with 15 interchanges in Kowloon, and 167 km with 33 interchanges in the New Territories. Nevertheless, the city's exhaustive congestion, amplified by densely built-up areas and topographic bottlenecks, continues to require successive roadway projects for greater urban mobility and environmental sustainability, including multimillion-and multibillion-dollar investments in highways (see Appendix Table A .1 for a list of projects).",

Of the limited work in developing economies, Cervero and Susantono (1999) provide evidence that proximity to highway interchanges is significantly capitalized into office rents in the monocentric metropolitan expansion of Jakarta, where value capture schemes could be considered to finance expensive transportation projects and discourage speculative land investments. Analyzing the non-residential rents for 10 years across three different territories in San Diego, Ryan (2005) shows that highway proximity provides more benefits to office properties (but not to industrial properties) than light rail transit proximity and central business district accessibility do. This empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that highway projects play a critical role in fueling the territorial divisions of city core, inner city, and outer suburban office markets for mobilitydriven and/or amenity-sensitive businesses in developed economies (Cervero, 1986; Garreau, 1991; Lang, 2003; Lee, 2007) .",

Some experiences of new high-occupancy toll roads with variable pricing after the late 1990s began to ease traffic congestion and raise housing values near highway interchanges in US suburbs (Boarnet and Chalermpong, 2001; Vadali, 2008) . By contrast, the physical removal of elevated highway infrastructure has been adopted progressively as a catalyst for urban regeneration in the central waterfront districts of deindustrializing cities, such as San Francisco and Seoul (Cervero, 2009) . Hedonic price analysis for residential property sales along two freeway-to-boulevard conversions in San Francisco demonstrates that the spatial reprioritization from mobility to amenity yields net benefits along the new greenways . Similarly, a few studies on Seoul's Cheong Gye Cheon project conclude that both elevated highway deconstruction and underground stream restoration stimulate land-use changes and cause non-residential property values to surge by appealing to knowledge-based office industries and creative-class workers (Jang and Kang, 2015; Kang and Cervero, 2009 ). The most controversial freeway removal is the Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) project in Boston, known as the \"Big Dig,\" with a project cost of US$ 24.3 billion and a series of construction failures. While traffic congestion and accidents induced by the new underground bypasses are debatable, the green spaces and waterfront passages created by this megaproject were predicted to increase the values of nearby condominiums and non-industrial estates in central Boston (Tajima, 2003) .",

Indeed, there have been several hedonic price studies on the growing demand for mobility improvements and amenity recreation in Hong Kong's rapid suburbanization and drastic deindustrialization during the last 2 decades. The findings on housing price premiums (or discounts) reported from Hong Kong's residential neighborhoods have typically been related to the positive externalities of public transportation systems (Chau and Ng, 1998; Choy et al., 2007; So et al., 1997) , living amenity traits (Hui et al., 2007; Jim and Chen, 2010; Tang and Yiu, 2010; Tse and Love, 2000) , and new transportation project announcements Yiu and Wong, 2005) at specific line, district, and site scales. More recently, some studies have begun to inspect the localized spillover effects of large-scale urban regeneration programs, enhancing railway accessibility and waterfront amenity attributes for Hong Kong's post-industrial economies, on office or retail property values within selected commercial districts (Jayantha and Ming, 2015; Jayantha et al., 2016; Liusman et al., 2017) . However, there is still a paucity of research with a special focus on the non-linear influences of both subsequent highway investments and growing traffic volumes on non-residential property markets across the three territorial divisions of Hong Kong in deindustrialization.",

Under the assumption of utility theory, a marketable good comprises a bundle of attributes and one property price revealed in the competitive market can be decomposed into the element prices of key attributes by analyzing various transactions as a hedonic price formula (Rosen, 1974) .",

With a chief interest in estimating the detailed capitalization effects of urban transportation and related environmental attributes, we incorporated public transit, highway interchange, and traffic volume variables separately into office price regressions. A set of numeric and/ or dummy variables for proximity to interchanges were primarily used to measure the accessibility benefits as well as environmental externalities arising from highway investments in both linear and nonlinear ways, as widely employed in many other hedonic studies on urban transportation. Moreover, we paid special attention to the multifaceted interpretation of traffic volumes in our model construction. Above all, traffic volumes at interchanges directly indicate the degree of both mobility and disamenity across different segments of the highway network. Next, traffic volumes at interchanges indirectly and partially represent the amount of market accessibility in diverse locations of the city. Furthermore, the temporal (time-lag or post-project) effects of highway investments are reflected as dynamic changes in traffic volumes at interchanges, since the growth of travel demand is induced by the provision of new transportation infrastructure in both short and long periods (Cervero, 2003) .",

Indeed, it would be methodologically difficult to analyze the multiple-decade bidirectional relationships between transportation infrastructure provisions and office market formations using a limited number of office property transactions in Hong Kong for only 12 years (e.g., repeat sales or difference-in-differences). Instead, we considered the short-term interplays between highway traffic volumes and office property prices within our mid-term dataset. Hypothetically, more economic interactions (increased traffic volumes) are likely to influence the productivity of firms at offices around highway interchanges (increased or decreased office prices), and then more productive firms (increased office prices) are likely to generate more economic interactions (increased traffic volumes) around highway interchanges in a short period. To mitigate the potential estimation bias produced by such dynamic interplays in Eq. (1), we applied the technique of two-stage least squares (2SLS) regressions, in which the endogenous variable for traffic volumes is instrumented by a few exogenous interchange-related variables. Note that the age of the highway interchange variable and multiple year lags were originally tested to capture the aforementioned temporal effects and causal associations in ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions; however, the 2SLS regression approach resulted in better model fitness and more significant estimates.

After preliminarily testing other spatial analysis techniques, such as spatial lag, spatial error, and general spatial models (Anselin, 2013) , we found spatial fixed-effects regressions as a logically suitable and statistically stable estimator for Hong Kong's territorial datasets on office property transactions, because the heterogeneity of variance appears to be identical between well-defined planning units or district boundaries and is correlated with independent variables.",

Second, since 2009, the government has intensively permitted non-compliant zoning codes to optimize former industrial buildings into sizable office spaces for Hong Kong's new creative economies, such as arts, entertainment, convention, education, and information and communication technology (HKSAR Development Bureau, 2017). Third, Hong Kong's major shopping malls and local retail streets are located predominately on and around railway stations, but not near highway interchanges. This is due in large part to the residents' transit-centered lifestyle and low private car ownership-about 72 vehicles per 1000 residents in 2013 (HKSAR Transport Department, 2015) . Fourth, an office-focused study on highway investment in Hong Kong is internationally comparable to the hedonic price literature on roadway network extensions in developed and developing economies, as reviewed in Section 2-specifically the territory-wide and/or non-linear capitalization effects of freeway (de)constructions on office properties presented by Cervero and Susantono (1999) , Cervero (2009), and Ryan (2005) .",

Importantly, 10,812 transactions (79.1%) were made within 800 m of the 32 interchanges across the three territorial The spatial proximity between office properties and highway interchanges was measured in two ways: straight distance and dummy variables for four distance ranges (within 200 m, 200-400 m, 400-600 m, and 600-800 m), enabling us to test both the linear and non-linear effects of highway proximity on office prices. In this spatial relation process, the closest interchange's traffic, size, age, and network distance to the immigration control point on the mainland China border were assigned to each transaction. In Hong Kong's real estate markets, regional locations or \"accessibility\" to railway stations and other public transit services have generally been considered far more important determinants of property values than highway interchanges are. To control for such accessibility effects in price regressions, straight distances to the central business district (CBD), nearest mass transit railway (MTR) station, nearest light rail (LR) stop in the New Territories, and the number of bus lines to the nearest MTR station were measured for each transaction.",

To grasp the essence of Hong Kong's deindustrialization, the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0 was re-categorized into five large industries: transportation, trade, knowledge, manufacturing, and others. Fig. 3 presents the five industries' percentage changes in employment for 2002-2013 across the three territorial divisions. The whole of Hong Kong experienced decreases in the range of 33.1-52.0% in the manufacturing industry but increases in the range of 24.4-59.8% in the knowledge industry. Remarkably, Hong Kong Island recorded decreases of 9.7% and 6.4% in the transportation and trade industries, respectively. On the contrary, Kowloon and the New Territories scored increases in the range of 23.4-37.8% in the transportation industry and 5.2-15.5% in the trade industry. We hypothesized that the capitalization effects of highway investments estimated from our office price regressions would be associated with these contrastive cross-industrial employment figures across the three territorial divisions.

These plots show that the premiums of proximity to highway interchanges are 11.1-19.8% and 68.5-72.8% for the two ranges within 400 m in Kowloon and the New Territories. However, the capitalization effects of highway interchanges in Kowloon seem redistributive within 800 m, since price discounts are observed to be 7.8-10.4% for the other two ranges beyond 400 m. By contrast, the price discounts of proximity to interchanges or disamenity generated by highways are more explicitly found to be 15.2-21.2% for all four ranges within 800 m on Hong Kong Island. Fig. 6 summarizes the effects of highway traffic volumes on office prices around interchanges across the three territorial divisions, using the six coefficients of Traffic at IC from the 2SLS regressions. Post instrumentation by interchange-related exogenous variables, traffic volumes (economic interactions) at highway interchanges are positively associated with nearby office property sales (business productivity) in Kowloon and the New Territories: all else being equal, office prices increase 1.7-2.0% and 1.7-2.6%, respectively, as traffic flows surge by 10% at the nearest interchange.

More precisely, the social costs generated by excess traffic exceed the accessibility benefits around highway interchanges in the city core, where tightly developed high-rise office buildings around railway stations are preferred for amenity-sensitive knowledge firms that have a propensity to demand more frequent and complex face-to-face communications for creativity. On the contrary, highway proximity and traffic elevates office values with lower transportation costs and greater market accessibility around interchanges in the inner city and outer suburbs, where sizable office estates near international seaport and logistics hubs are available for mobility-driven trade and transportation firms that have a tendency to make greater profits through cross-boundary interactions with mainland China. These territorial experiences with highway investment in Hong Kong are certainly consistent with the non-linear reconfiguration associated with freeway reinvestment and deconstruction in San Diego and Seoul in the stage of deindustrialization Ryan, 2005) but are rather dissimilar to the linear expansion with highway network in Jakarta during the process of industrialization (Cervero and Susantono, 1999) . Our territorial findings in comparison with other international experiences lend some credence to the generalized statement that the land-use and economic development impacts of urban transportation investment depend on the context of intermodal network development and overall accessibility (Banister and Berechman, 2000, 2001; Giuliano and Agarwal, 2017) . In particular, our empirical results infer that the marginal economic benefits (social costs) of an additional highway interchange in a densely built-up city core with multiple railway stations and other public transit services are much smaller (greater) than those of an original highway interchange in an expansively stretching outer suburb with limited modal options. While Hong Kong's railway investment integrated with territorial development is widely acknowledged by policymakers across developed and developing economies for sustainable urbanization, our empirical evidence from the world's foremost railway-guided city is a reminder that strategic highway investments together with supportive public transit services and adaptive land-use rezoning must play a critical role in directing the territorial development of major Asian cities in the dynamic and complex process of deindustrialization for competitiveness and sustainability.",

Actually, on Hong Kong Island, the on-going Central-Wan Chai Bypass construction at an estimated cost of HK$ 36 billion is expected to divert excess traffic from surface to underground, provide recreational greenery, and yield property price premiums along harbor-front business districts (HKSAR Highways Department, 2015) . Based on the appreciation of office price premiums around interchanges in the inner city and extra suburbs, policymakers might consider adopting land-value capture techniques to recover the increasing costs of strategic highway projects. Our empirical results from office property sales could partially and indirectly support such financing; however, business gains basically are reflected as increases in corporate tax via operating revenues. In practice, Hong Kong's highway expenditure is linked to capital revenues largely reserved from the government's land-leasing program, called the Capital Works Reserve Fund. Therefore, to extend this fiscal argument, further research needs to be conducted to directly inspect the capitalization effects of highway investments on government land-leasing revenues, supplemented by our findings on market transaction prices.",

First, this research analyzed Hong Kong's growing office property market for the past 12 years only. Hedonic price analysis of Hong Kong's shrinking industrial estate market over the past few decades should be conducted to capture the changing value of highways in deindustrialization more profoundly and for a longer period. Second, Hong Kong's traffic data obtained from a public source contain aggregate volumes only, although the proportion and concentration of private cars and industrial vehicles are very likely to have changed spatiotemporally during deindustrialization. Scrutinizing the capitalization effects attributed to vehicle types and peak hours could provide more profound implications if a detailed traffic or behavior dataset were to become available in Hong Kong or other Asian cities. Finally, our study addressed deindustrialization within Hong Kong's administrative territories only. Future research should be comparably and/or extensively designed for near and remote major cities in the Pearl River Delta, such as Shenzhen, Macau, Dongguan, and Guangzhou, to obtain a more comprehensive perspective on the value of highway investment in deindustrialization for region-wide competitiveness and sustainability.",
