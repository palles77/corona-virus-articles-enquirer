Given that the average adult suffers from two to five colds each year (Heath et al 1992) it is not surprising that the socioeconomic consequences of these illnesses are considerable in terms of days lost from work and costs of medical consultation, care and over-the-counter remedies. As such, these illnesses present a real concern to the wellbeing of both athletes and the general population and therefore an understanding of the relationship between physical activity and infection risk is of great importance.",

According to this model, taking part in some regular moderate physical activity decreases the relative risk of URTI below that of a sedentary individual. However, performing prolonged, high-intensity exercise or periods of strenuous exercise training is associated with an above-average risk of URTI. When first proposed, the J-shaped model was based on the findings of a relatively small number of studies and the majority of these explored the relationship between heavy exercise and URTI risk. There has been further interest in this area in recent years, particularly with regard to the relationship between moderate exercise and incidence of URTI. This provides us with additional evidence to consider when assessing the relationship between exercise and infection risk and we can now more effectively evaluate the validity of the J-shaped model.",

In a survey examining the long-term health value of endurance exercise training, responses from 750 'Masters Athletes' (age range 40-81 years) suggested that 76% considered themselves as 'less vulnerable to illness than their peers' and 68% regarded their quality of life as 'much better than that of their sedentary friends' (Shephard et al 1995) . In a further survey of 170 nonelite marathon runners, 90% agreed with the statement that they 'rarely get sick' (Nieman 2000) . Thus, anecdotal reports such as these certainly support the J-shaped model concerning the relationship between moderate exercise and infection risk. However, these reports alone by no means validate this portion of the J-shaped model; data from experimental and epidemiological studies needs to be considered.",

            "text": "On the whole, the studies that have looked at the relationship between moderate (and more intense) exercise and infection risk have been survey-based epidemiological studies. In the majority of these studies, a physician has not diagnosed an episode of URTI; rather, subjects have completed a questionnaire or a daily logbook in which they noted their symptoms of illness (including URTI) either during the study or retrospectively. For example, in one randomized exercise training study that is typical of many of the studies carried out on this topic, subjects recorded health problems each day by means of codes including: cold (runny nose, cough, sore throat), allergy (itchy eyes, stuffy nose), headache, fever, nausea/vomiting/ diarrhoea, fatigue/tiredness, muscle/joint/bone problem or injury, menstrual cramps, other (describe), or none (Nieman et al 1990b) . An episode of URTI was defined as coding for a cold with or without supporting symptoms of headache, fever, fatigue/tiredness or nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea for 48 hours and separated from a previous episode by at least 1 week. In most studies, physical activity patterns are also assessed by questionnaire. These studies have the advantage in that they allow large cohorts to be studied, although the reliability of the data gained from these studies may depend upon the experimental design; for example, memory recall over long periods of time has obvious potential for error. One study that illustrates both of these points examined the relationship between physical activity patterns and episodes of URTI in 199 young Dutch adults (age range 20-23 years) (Schouten et al 1988) . The 92 men and 107 women were asked to recall habitual physical activity over the previous 3 months and symptoms of URTI over the previous 6 months. In both the men and women, the incidence and duration of URTI symptoms was not related to total physical activity, although a significant, albeit very weak, negative correlation was found between sports activity (range 0-480 minutes/week) and incidence of URTI in the women (r = \u22120.18). However, despite the large cohort studied, the long period of recall used in this study may call the reliability of these findings into question.",

The exercise training was supervised and comprised five 45-minute sessions of brisk walking at 60% heart rate reserve each week. Symptoms of illness were recorded daily in a logbook and, importantly, all of the women were unaware of the aims of the study. Over the 15-week study period, the actual number of URTI episodes did not differ between the two groups. However, the women in the exercising group reported significantly fewer days with URTI symptoms compared with the sedentary controls (5.1 \u00b1 1.2 days versus 10.8 \u00b1 2.3 days in the exercising and control groups, respectively; Fig. 1 .2).",

In a similar study, 14 previously sedentary elderly women (aged 67-85) completed 12 weeks of supervised brisk walking (Nieman et al 1993) with another group of 16 of their sedentary peers participating in supervised sessions of callisthenics (light exercise involving muscular strength and flexibility work) over the same period. Only three of the walkers experienced an episode of URTI during the study period, compared with eight of the individuals in the callisthenics group. In addition, both groups were also compared with a group of 12 highly conditioned elderly women, who were still actively involved in endurance competitions; only one of these women experienced an episode of URTI during the same period. However, this study was performed during the autumn, and so may have been influenced by seasonal variations in exposure to pathogens (microorganisms that cause disease) and immune function. Nevertheless, in support of these findings, a prospective study performed over a whole year found that the number and duration of episodes of URTI in 61 men and women aged 66-84 years were negatively related with daily energy expenditure (Kostka et al 2000) , as assessed by questionnaire and daily logbooks. These subjects were involved only in moderate intensity activities, with the majority of the activities being performed indoors.",

            "text": "On the face of it, the findings of these studies certainly lend some support to the moderate exercise portion of the J-shaped model. However, it does raise the question of whether these findings are specific to the populations studied. For example, it may be that the elderly begin these investigations with a poorer level of immune function, and so any benefit of increased physical exercise may be more obvious (Shephard & Shek 1999) . In addition, other factors should also be considered. Nutritional status is known to influence immune function (as discussed further in Chs 8 and 9) and as such may be an important factor in determining an individual's susceptibility to infection; in the study of the elderly women, the well-conditioned group had a much higher dietary intake of energy and of several vitamins and minerals (Nieman et al 1993) . Psychological influences are also well known to affect measures of immune function (this is discussed further in Ch. 11), with decreases in measures of psychological stress associated with enhancement of several aspects of immune function. Interestingly, in both the elderly and younger, mildly obese women, participation in supervised exercise programmes was associated with increased feelings of general wellbeing (Cramer et al 1991 , Nieman et al 1993 . Furthermore, the selection criteria used may well present some degree of bias towards those with a 'healthy lifestyle'. The inclusion criteria for these studies may require individuals to be non-smokers and to be free from ailments such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease; as such, these individuals may be less vulnerable to infection anyway. In support of this, a recent retrospective study found no relationship between habitual moderate physical activity and the incidence of colds in over 14 000 middle-aged smokers (Hemil\u00e4 et al 2003) . These confounding factors aside, the findings of one recent study appear to give further support to the hypothesis that regular moderate exercise is associated with a lower incidence of URTI. The relationship between exercise and infection risk was explored across a broad range of age (from 20 to 70 years) and habitual physical activity level (Matthews et al 2002) . Over 500 adults were asked to recall episodes of colds (used to assess incidence of URTI), flu or allergic episodes at 3-month intervals over a period of a year. Explicit symptoms for assessment of URTI occurrence (e.g. runny nose, cough and sore throat) were not routinely recorded. Physical activity levels were assessed by 24-hour recall occurring on three occasions within 7 weeks of each URTI recall and took into consideration physical activity at home, work and during leisure time. The findings suggested that moderate physical activity was associated with a 20-30% reduction in annual risk of URTI, compared with low levels of activity. Although this study was based on 3-month recall of 'colds' rather than any specific symptoms of URTI, the patterns of seasonal variation in episodes of URTI were similar to others in the literature that have used more intensive assessment methods. As you can see in Figure 1 .3, colds were four times more prevalent in the winter months (November-March) than in the summer (June-August). In contrast, allergies were more common in the summertime. Furthermore, the data were also adjusted for many of the known risk factors for infection, such as age, smoking, anxiety, depression and dietary factors such as macronutrient and vitamin supplement intake.",

            "text": "On balance, the evidence from the available randomized controlled studies and larger survey-based studies does suggest some positive benefit of moderate exercise in reducing incidence of URTI. Furthermore, the finding that young women engaging in regular brisk walking compared with a sedentary lifestyle had fewer URTI symptom days suggests that moderate exercise may decrease URTI symptom severity and duration (Nieman et al 1990b) . One study to address this assertion in a controlled situation vaccinated 50 moderately trained college students with human Rhinovirus on two consecutive days (Weidner et al 1998) . Thirty-four of the students then went on to exercise at 70% heart rate reserve for 40 minutes every other day for 10 days, with the remaining 16 students assigned to a no-exercise condition. Over the 10 days, symptom severity and duration was assessed using a checklist and by weighing collected facial tissues. Throughout the 10 days post-vaccination, mean scores on the symptom questionnaire did not differ between the two groups, neither were there any differences in mass of the collected tissues. While these findings suggest that continuing to exercise during an URTI in moderately fit individuals does not affect symptom severity or duration, any extrapolation of these findings should be taken with caution. Human Rhinovirus accounts for only 40% of cold infections (Weidner et al 1998) and other cold-causing viruses, such as coronavirus, may have different symptom profiles because the immune response is specific to the invading pathogen. As this study investigated only Rhinovirus-caused URTI, this may account for the discrepancies between the findings of this study and those of Nieman et al (1990b) where the episodes of URTI experienced by the women were naturally occurring. Nevertheless, as a guideline, it is recommended that individuals do not exercise if symptoms are 'below the neck' (e.g. fever, diarrhoea, chesty cough, aching joints and muscles, swollen lymph glands). However, if the symptoms are above the neck (e.g. runny nose, sneezing) then exercise at low to moderate intensities may be performed (Weidner et al 1998) .",

Nevertheless, in the study of 36 mildly obese women discussed above, brisk walking for 45 minutes, five times a week over a 15-week period was associated with a 57% increase in natural killer cell cytotoxic activity (NKCA) after 6 weeks of the study compared with an increase of just 3% in the control group (Nieman et al 1990b) . NK cells are a type of lymphocyte (further details about NK cells can be found in Ch. 2) and unlike the other lymphocyte sub-populations T and B cells, NK cells are able to destroy a variety of virus-infected cells spontaneously. NK cells form an important first line of defence against viral infection, and as such, the greater NKCA, or killing ability, found after 6 weeks of moderate exercise training could account for the fewer URTI symptom days experienced by the exercising group. However, this elevation of NKCA was not observed at the end of the 15 weeks of training; this was suggested by the authors to be perhaps due to seasonal variations in this measure of immune function. Elevated NKCA was also not found after 5 or 12 weeks of a brisk walking training programme in elderly women compared with their peers who participated in callisthenics training (Nieman et al 1993) . This was despite observing a lower incidence of URTI in the walkers during this time, as discussed above. It was suggested that any training-induced adaptation in NK defence mechanisms may require longer to develop in elderly individuals because baseline comparison of the sedentary women with a group of highly conditioned elderly women revealed that NKCA was 54% higher in the highly conditioned women. As you may remember, these women also had the lowest incidence of URTI among the three groups. It has also been suggested that immunoglobulin-A (IgA) may play a role in the apparent altered susceptibility to URTI associated with moderate exercise. IgA is the principal immunoglobulin (or antibody) in mucosal secretions (e.g. tears, saliva); therefore, IgA is an important defence mechanism against pathogens trying to enter through the oral mucosa (see Chapter 2 for further details about the structure and function of immunoglobulins). A 12-week exercise training programme (three aerobic training sessions per week, each lasting 30 minutes at 70% heart rate reserve) was associated with a 57% increase in salivary-IgA (s-IgA) concentration compared with baseline in nine previously sedentary men and women (Klentrou et al 2002) . A non-significant decrease in s-IgA concentration was observed at the same time point in a group of sedentary controls. URTI symptoms were recorded in daily logbooks, using codes similar to those described previously. In addition, subjects were asked to code their symptoms as 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe'. Although it is possible that the perception of severity of symptoms may differ between individuals and hence may undermine the reliability of these data, there were fewer 'severe' URTI symptom days in the exercising group compared with the controls during the study. A significant negative relationship was found between s-IgA levels and total sickness days (r = \u22120.64, P<0.05) (i.e. higher s-IgA levels were associated with fewer days with sickness). However, a significant relationship between s-IgA concentration and days reporting only cold symptoms was not found, with the authors suggesting that this was due to some ambiguity in the description of the cold-related symptoms. Given the small number of subjects in the study, it might be that a larger-scale study is needed to confirm these findings. However, a significant negative relationship between s-IgA concentration and incidence of URTI (as assessed by a physician) has been reported in a group of moderately trained subjects (Gleeson et al 1999) . These subjects were involved in regular exercise programmes for up to 4 hours per week over a 7-month period, and formed the control group for a group of elite swimmers; a similar relationship between s-IgA and incidence of infection was also found for these athletes.",

As mentioned earlier, these studies have the advantage of allowing large numbers of athletes to be studied. On the other hand it should be acknowledged that the self-reporting of URTI by athletes may be influenced by a degree of positive response bias in the data: it could be argued that those athletes who respond to these questionnaires are more likely to be those who have symptoms of URTI (i.e. a positive response).

In a randomly selected sample of 140 runners in the 1982 Two Oceans Marathon (a distance of 56 km) in Cape Town, 33% of the runners reported symptoms of URTI in the 2-week period following the race, compared with 15% of a group of age-matched non-running controls, each of whom lived in the same household as one of the runners (Peters & Bateman 1983) . Further examination of the data revealed a significant negative relationship between racetime and post-race illness with symptoms of URTI far more prevalent in those runners who completed the race in less than 4 hours, suggesting a relationship between acute exercise stress and susceptibility to URTI (Fig. 1.4) . Similar findings were reported from a cohort of over 2000 runners who took part in the 1987 Los Angeles Marathon (Nieman et al 1990a) . During the week after the marathon, 13% of the runners reported symptoms of URTI compared with only 2% of a group of similarly experienced runners who did not compete for reasons other than illness. In addition, 40% of the runners experienced at least one episode of URTI during the 2 months prior to the marathon itself. After controlling for confounding factors such as age, perceived stress levels and illness in the home, it was found that those who ran more than 96 km (60 miles) per week in training were twice as likely to suffer illness compared with those who trained less than 32 km (20 miles) per week.",

For example, over a 1-year period, 22 episodes of URTI (as diagnosed by a physician) were observed in a group of professional European footballers compared with only nine episodes in a group of untrained controls. There was also a tendency for the URTI symptoms to last longer in the footballers compared with the controls. In another study, Foster (1998) reported that the majority of illnesses experienced by a group of competitive speed skaters occurred when the athletes exceeded individually identifiable training thresholds, with almost 90% of these illnesses occurring within 10 days of a peak in training strain, although it should be noted that these illnesses were not explicitly recorded as episodes of URTI.",

            "text": "Taken together, these studies suggest that performing both acute bouts of intense, prolonged exercise and higher volumes of training are associated with an increased susceptibility to URTI, thus supporting the J-shaped model. However, it is important to keep this in perspective: the findings of these studies suggest that the relative risk of an episode of URTI is increased following heavy exercise but the majority of athletes do not experience an episode of URTI after prolonged strenuous activity. For example, in the cohort of over 2000 marathon runners who completed the 1987 Los Angeles marathon, only one in every seven marathon runners reported symptoms of URTI in the week following the event (Nieman et al 1990a) . In addition, exercise duration may be a critical factor in determining post-race susceptibility for URTI because performing 5 km, 10 km and 21.1 km events was associated with the same incidence of URTI in the week after the race as that reported in the week before (Nieman et al 1989) . Other factors that may influence these findings should also not be overlooked. The Los Angeles marathon is held in March and reported episodes of URTI are lower in the summer than in the winter months (Nieman 2000) . In support of this, 77% of the URTI diagnosed in professional footballers occurred during the winter months (Bury et al 1998) , although equally it could be argued that it is during this period that the footballers would have been training and competing most heavily. As well as ambient conditions, other environmental factors may also contribute to the finding of increased episodes of URTI following marathon events in large cities such as Cape Town and Los Angeles. Exposure to elevated levels of ozone during exercise has been associated with increased mortality in mice exposed to Streptococcus pyogenes, while exposure to elevated levels of sulphur dioxide increased leukocyte counts in the lungs of males following 20 minutes of light-intensity cycling (Illing et al 1980 , Sandstr\u00f6m et al 1989 . In addition, inhalation of air pollutants could cause the symptoms of a sore throat in the absence of any infection. Other possible reasons for the increased incidence of URTI reported in athletes include poor dietary practices, increased exposure to pathogens (through sharing drinking bottles and spending time in close proximity to others -for example at training camps) and elevated psychological stress (Shephard & Shek 1999) . These issues are discussed further in Chapter 12.",

The decline in host defence mechanisms after exercise has been termed an 'open window' during which viruses and bacteria may gain entry into the body, thus increasing the risk of infection (Nieman 2000) . In theory, a chronic depression of immune function could arise over a period of time during which strenuous exercise is performed without sufficient time for recovery of immune cell function. However, although there is a great deal of evidence for a decrease in the ability of isolated immune cells to respond to a challenge following strenuous exercise (as discussed in Chs 4 and 5), a direct link between impaired immune function in vivo and subsequent infection has not yet been established. One of the reasons for this is the serious ethical issues involved in inoculating subjects with a known cold-causing virus and asking them to participate in heavy exercise. One major concern here is the potential risk of viral myocarditis (a viral infection of the heart muscle); exercising during a viral infection may increase the likelihood of developing this potentially fatal condition.",

In this study, several antigens (foreign proteins that induce an antibody response) were injected into the skin on the forearms of trained triathletes following a half-ironman event. This action should stimulate an immune response to each of the antigens, known as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a raised red swelling of the skin at the site where the antigen was applied. After 48 hours, an investigator recorded the diameter of the resulting swelling, giving a positive reading if the mean diameter was 2 mm or more. The implication is that the larger the area of the swelling the stronger the immune response to that antigen. The skin test responses of the triathletes were compared with those of a group of triathletes who did not take part in the event in addition to a group of moderately trained controls. The lowest cumulative responses to the skin tests (i.e. lowest number of positive readings and sum of the diameters of the swellings) were found in the exercised triathletes ( Fig. 1.5 The cumulative skin test score (number of positive responses and sum of the diameters of the raised swellings) in a group of triathletes following a triathlon race (group A), a group of triathletes who did not compete in the race (group B) and a group of moderately trained individuals (group C). The response of group A was significantly lower than that of groups B and C.

Research into this area has generally concentrated on survey-based studies of large cohorts of competitive endurance-trained athletes and the findings do provide support for a relationship between heavy exercise and increased risk for URTI, thus supporting the J-shaped model. However, whether or not this increase in susceptibility for infection is associated with the documented impairment of immune function observed following prolonged, intense exercise is still not wholly proven. A number of other factors may also contribute to the higher number of infections experienced by athletes, including environmental factors, increased exposure to pathogens, poor nutritional practices and increased psychological stress.
