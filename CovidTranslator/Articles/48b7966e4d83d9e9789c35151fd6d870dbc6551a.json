CQ has been used in SARS Coronavirus infection due to its antiviral properties 5 6 . Recently CQ has also been found to have Anti-COVID-19 activity in vitro 7 . For these reasons, CQ and HCQ could be the potential drug for treating COVID-19 infection. To date, there is no clinical evidence to support the use of CQ or HCQ for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection though many clinical trials with these drugs are already underway 8 .

CQ had a significant inhibitory antiviral effect when the susceptible cells were treated either before or after infection, suggesting a possible prophylactic and therapeutic use. 5 CQ interferes with COVID-19's attempt to acidify the lysosomes & probably inhibits cathepsins, which needs a low pH for optimal cleavage of COVID-19 spike protein, a requirement for the formation of the autophagosome. 18 The Wuhan CoV (COVID-19) S-protein shares an almost identical 3-D structure in its RBD domain with SARS-CoV S-protein. Although relatively weaker than SARS-CoV, the Wuhan CoV S-protein has a strong binding affinity to human ACE2 receptors. Hence, the Wuhan CoV poses a significant risk for human transmission due to the S-protein-ACE2 binding pathway like SARS-CoV. 20 39 CQ has been found to function at both entry as well as post-entry stages of the COVID-19 infection in Vero E6 cells. The immune-modulating activity of CQ may also synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo. After oral intake, CQ gets widely distributed in the whole body, including lung. The EC90 value of chloroquine against the COVID-19 in Vero E6 cells was 6.90\u03bcM, which is achievable clinically, as shown in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving 500 mg daily dose 7 . The low cost and good safety profile makes CQ a potentially clinically applicable drug against the COVID-19 infection. 7 The endemic malaria presence seems to protect certain populations from COVID-19 infection, especially in the least developed countries. The mechanism of action of some antimalarial drugs with antiviral property suggests their potential role in the chemoprophylaxis of the COVID-19 epidemic. 22",

This document also emphasizes the need for stopping the treatment at day 5 to reduce the risk of side effects, as CQ has a long half-life of 30 hours. There is also a need to differentiate between treatment based on chloroquine phosphate and chloroquine base since 500 mg of chloroquine phosphate is equivalent to 300 mg of chloroquine base. Another set of guidelines by the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical disease (Lombardy section) suggests the use of CQ 500 mg twice daily or HCQ 200 mg once daily for ten days with treatment duration varying between 5 to 20 days based on clinical severity. The suggested target group of patients ranged from patients with mild respiratory symptoms having comorbidities to patients with severe respiratory failure. 11 CQ has been recommended for 18-65 years of COVID-19 infected adults at a dose of 500mg twice daily for seven days. For BW \u2264 50 kg patients, the CQ dose should be decreased to 500 once daily during day third to seventh of the treatment cycle ( Table 1 ). There has been no dose recommendation of CQ in COVID-19 infected children so far; hence extreme caution should be followed while prescribing it for children. Acute poisoning of CQ is usually fatal with a dose of 50 mg/kg, and CQ concentration > 25 \u03bc mol/L is a fatal predictor. 12 In Nigerian children with acute uncomplicated malaria, chloroquine absorption appeared reliable as peak chloroquine concentrations were achieved within 0.5 hours, and its concentration decline slowly, with an elimination half-life of 20 to 60 days.",

Severe adverse reactions to CQ were not seen in these patients. The drug has been recommended for inclusion in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19, issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. 14 This would be the first successful use of CQ in humans for treating acute viral disease. However, this information should be carefully considered before drawing any definitive conclusion as no supporting clinical data has been released yet. 16 As of 23rd February 2020, seven clinical trial registries have been found in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry for using HCQ to COVID-19 treatment. It has been reported that the safe dosage of HCQ (6-6.5 mg/kg per day) could reach serum levels of 1.4-1.5 \u03bc M in humans. In animals, CQ and HCQ share similar tissue distribution, with concentrations in the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung reaching levels, which are 200-700 times higher than those in the plasma. Therefore a very high concentration in the above tissues is likely to be achieved with the safe dosage of HCQ for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. This possibility, however, awaits confirmation by clinical trials. 15 In patients with COVID-19 infection, CQ can interact with lopinavir/ritonavir, Causing QT interval prolongation. Hence HCQ can be considered instead of CQ when the latter is not available for COVID-19 treatment 17 .",

Many other viruses like Ebola (EBOV) depend on the naturally low pH of acidic endosomes for activating and triggering the fusion by their envelope glycoproteins. Thus a 'fusion inhibitor' could target the host cell machinery by preventing the acidification of the endosome to inhibit virus entry.",

These drugs increase the pH of acidic vesicles, cause disruption of several enzymes like acid hydrolases & lead to inhibition of the post-transcriptional modification of newly synthesized proteins. The mechanisms thought to explain the anti-HIV-1 effect of CQ and HCQ include: alteration in gp120 production, restriction of intracellular iron (a cofactor) necessary for HIV-1 replication, an effect on Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR, and the effect on the HIV-1 integrase. 34 During animal testing, CQ was also found to effectively inhibit autophagy in the lungs of avian influenza H5N1 mice and reduce alveolar epithelial damage. CQ could efficiently ameliorate the acute lung injury and significantly improve the survival rate in mice infected with live avian influenza A H5N1 virus. 35 Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses having non-segmented, single-stranded & positive-sense RNA genomes. Apart from causing infections in vertebrates in the meat industry like pigs and chickens, until recently, six coronaviruses are known to infect human hosts & cause respiratory diseases.
