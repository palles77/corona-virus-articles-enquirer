            "text": "There is an emerging need for viral gene specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays that validate and complement whole transcriptome level technologies, including microarray and next generation sequencing. Therefore, a compilation of qPCR assays that represented the breadth of the entire Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome were developed and evaluated. SYBR Green-I-based quantitation of each of the 74 HSV-1 lytic genes enabled accurate and reproducible detection of viral genes using a minimal number of reaction conditions. The amplification specificity of these assays for HSV-1 target genes was confirmed by amplicon size and purity determination on agarose gels, melt temperature dissociation curve analysis, and direct DNA sequencing of amplified products. Analysis of representative target genes demonstrated that these assays accurately and reproducibly quantified target gene expression across a wide and linear range of detection. In addition, minimal intra-and inter-assay variability was observed with significant well-to-well and plate-to-plate/assay-to-assay precision. To evaluate the utility of the developed qPCR assay system, kinetic profiles of viral gene expression were determined for an array of representative genes from all HSV-1 transcriptional gene classes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the compiled optimized qPCR assays is a scalable and cost-effective method to assess HSV-1 gene expression with broad application potential, including investigation of pathogenesis and antiviral therapies. In addition, they can be employed to validate and complement evolving technologies for genome-wide transcriptome analysis.",

            "text": "The human Herpesviridae family consists of 9 large DNA viruses that encode open reading frames that specify between 74 and 164 genes. The alphaherpesvirus, Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), specifies a 152 kilobase pair genome that encodes 77 open reading frames of which three are diploid (Pellett and Roizman, 2007; Roizman et al, 2007) . These genes are expressed during the HSV lytic replicative cycle in a triphasic sequential and coordinately regulated temporal cascade of gene expression Roizman, 1974, 1975; . First, immediate early or alpha (IE/a) genes are expressed immediately upon deposition of viral DNA into the nucleus Roizman, 1974, 1975) . Next, IE proteins launch the expression of early or Beta (E/\u03b23) genes that initiate viral DNA replication and elicit subsequent late or gamma (L/\u03b3) gene expression (Honess and Roizman, 1974) ; Lastly, the L/\u03b3 genes consist of proteins that are either structural in nature or function to mediate capsid assembly, virion maturation, and viral egress (Honess and Roizman, 1974) . The gamma gene class has been further subdivided into \u03b31 and \u03b32 genes, with \u03b32 gene transcription absolutely dependent on viral DNA replication. Consequently, the effects of cellular proteins, viral gene mutations/deletions, or pharmaceutical drugs on these highly ordered viral transcriptional patterns can provide insights into their functional activities. For example, HSV infected cells that are treated with the viral DNA replication inhibitors foscarnet or acyclovir exhibit an altered transcriptional pattern, whereby there is an accumulation of early \u03b2 transcripts and suppression of late \u03b3 gene expression (Jones and Roizman, 1979; Holland et al, 1980; Hall et al., 1982) .",

In virus infected cells, these technologies enable simultaneous assessment of both host and viral transcription. However, despite these technologies generating data with immense depth, results still require confirmation by more standard and accepted approaches, such as quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). qPCR arrays, such as the system presented in this study, can complement, corroborate, and validate results obtained from these contemporary methodologies. For most viruses with small genomes, designing qPCR assays that can assess whole genome transcriptional changes is relatively uncomplicated.

NC_001806.1) was used as template to identify comprehensive, genome-wide coding sequences for each HSV-1 transcript (McGeoch et al., 1988a, b) . In order to specifically amplify regions within each coding sequence, unique primers were designed to avoid overlapping genes and assessed subsequently for potential hairpin formations, 3\u2032 complementarities, and self-annealing sites using OligoCalc (Kibbe, 2007) . Primer pairs were selected to generate amplicons of 90-200 base pairs (Tables 1-5 ). All primer sets were designed initially with uniform annealing temperatures to facilitate assessing multiple gene targets within the same PCR run. Prospective primers and their generated amplicons were analyzed in silico for cross-reactivity and recognition of other HSV-1 strains and verified to have no significant homology to Homo sapiens host genes using the genomic database for human and human transcripts and BLASTn (NCBI). All designed iterations of primer pairs were tested empirically for amplification of target genes from HSV-1 KOS genomic viral DNA and cDNA isolated from HSV-1 RE infected cells. Any primer pairs that exhibited any amplification product at or before 30 cycles from cDNA prepared from non-infected cell lysates were excluded from further analysis. The specificity of each selected primer pair was evaluated by melt curve analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing and confirmed to be a single uniform amplification product of appropriate apparent molecular size and sequence. Final optimized primer sequences, associated gene references, specific assay conditions, and amplicon characteristics are described in Tables 1-5. In addition, cellular 18s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was utilized to normalize qPCR reactions (FOR: 5\u2032CCAGTAAGTGCGGGTCATAAGC3\u2032; REV: 5\u2032GCCTCACTAAACCATCCAATCGG3\u2032) (Mbong et al., 2012) .

Three-step cycling parameters were used for a majority of PCR reactions and were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by a 30 s extension at 72 \u00b0C. To minimize cross-reactivity issues and increase specificity, a two-step cycling parameter was used for PCR reactions against UL30 and UL42 and was as follows: initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and annealing at 65 \u00b0C for 30 s. Following amplification, amplicon specificity and purity for each PCR run was confirmed by melt curve analysis.",

This required two different reaction conditions. For the vast majority of HSV genes (72 of 74 genes) and cellular 18s rRNA reference gene, reaction conditions with a 55 \u00b0C annealing temperature was utilized (Tables 1-5; Fig. 1C ; Supplemental Figs. 1C, 2C, and 3C). However, two beta genes, UL30 and UL42, required altered reaction conditions with an annealing temperature of 65 \u00b0C in order to fulfill all of our specificity requirements (Table 2; Supplemental Fig. 2B and C) . Specific reaction conditions are provided in Section 2.5. All individual qPCR assays exhibited a single linear amplification phase within the logarithmic curve for both genomic viral DNA and cDNA of viral transcripts from infected cells. However, the HSV-1 genomic DNA and infected cell cDNA amplification curves differed due to variances in the levels of the target gene at the specific time point assessed. The method of calculating Cq values from where they cross the indicated threshold are provided within the Section 2. Since HSV-1 has a limited number of spliced genes, primers could not be designed across introns. Therefore, the most critical assay optimization was ensuring that viral genomic DNA was removed completely prior to quantitative analysis. This was verified by the absence of detectable amplification within the no reverse transcriptase (NRT) controls. The complete degradation of genomic viral DNA was ensured by extracting, processing, and purifying RNA with the protocols in Section 2.3.",

Since Dr. Edward Wagner's laboratory developed an oligonucleotide-based DNA microarray approach to study global changes in HSV-1 gene transcript abundance in the late 1990s, many techniques have been developed or utilized for analyzing levels of alpha-herpesvirus gene expression to facilitate recognition of broad effects of various treatments or cellular factors on viral gene expression (Stingley et al., 2000; Wagner et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2002; Cohrs et al., 2003 Cohrs et al., , 2006 Aguilar et al, 2005 Aguilar et al, , 2006 Deitch et al, 2005; Kennedy et al., 2005; Kamakura et al., 2008) . However, these techniques can be expensive, generate an immense dataset that requires extensive and complicated analysis, and often still require validation or replication for statistical evaluation by secondary methods, such as qPCR. These factors limit their utility in examining the effects of various treatments at multiple kinetic points, as each new condition or time point increases exponentially the parameters required to be assessed. This study describes the development and evaluation of individual qPCR assays that represent collectively the breadth of the entire HSV-1 transcriptome in a format that would reduce overall cost and simplify assessment of gene expression. Although there are other reports of qPCR primers and conditions that represent individual or subsets of HSV-1 (Chen et al., 1997; Hukkanen et al., 2000; Broberg et al, 2003; Carr and Al-Khatib, 2003; Wang et al, 2005) , this work represents a compilation of optimized primer sets and validated reaction conditions that were developed specifically to analyze the entire HSV-1 lytic transcriptome.",

            "text": "The success and adaptability of a qPCR assay for HSV-1 gene expression is highly dependent on several factors. First, it is imperative that the qPCR system has the ability to recognize multiple strains of HSV-1 with a high level of specificity for each target gene. In addition, with multiple gene targets on one plate, optimized performance with a single thermal cycling protocol and reaction condition are necessary for utilizing the system as a qPCR array. Lastly, it is essential for the qPCR system to quantify RNA levels accurately across a wide linear range of template concentrations with minimal intra-and inter-assay variability. Critical to these parameters is the initial design and evaluation of primer sets, which were considered carefully for the assays presented in this study. In turn, the final optimized primer sets were selected to be highly specific for their target gene and recognized multiple HSV-1 strains. The absence of significant intra-or inter-assay variation enables plate-to-plate comparisons between results obtained or to provide statistical significance when examining replicate data sets. In short, these assays can be utilized to measure relative changes in HSV-1 gene expression reproducibly and accurately, either as a primary tool for expression analysis or a confirmatory method following microarray or NGS. One intriguing finding was the ability of melting temperature dissociation curve analysis to detect single nucleotide differences within the amplified products of different strains, especially within the TK gene where mutations can result in drug resistance (Coen and Schaffer, 1980; Furman et al, 1981; Coen et al., 1982; Frobert et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007) .",

Visualization of expression values on a heat map facilitated direct comparison of transcriptional class specific expression profiles. As expected, each transcriptional class exhibited patterns of gene expression that were indicative of their known timing of expression and their roles in HSV-1 replication. Interestingly, the UL2 gene expression pattern did not match other beta genes, but rather exhibited a profile that was reminiscent of the gamma gene class (Fig. 3B ).

The Cq values for amplification of serial 2 fold dilutions of HSV-1 KOS genomic DNA were determined (B) and plotted relative to the quantity of viral genomic DNA (A). Red and light blue dotted lines (A) correspond to the 168.8 pg (red) and 1350 pg (light blue) amplification curves (B). The R 2 value for each representative gene's dilution series is shown as an assessment of assay linearity.
