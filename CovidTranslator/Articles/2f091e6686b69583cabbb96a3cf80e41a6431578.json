Phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 exhibited growth over a wide range of temperature and pH conditions and showed different efficiency of plating values and lytic spectra within the same strains at 25 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. Highthroughput sequencing revealed that vB_BbrM_PHB04 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome with 124 putative open reading frames. Overall, the genome of vB_BbrM_PHB04 showed very low similarity (the highest nucleotide identity 82%, 1% coverage) to other phage sequences in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that vB_BbrM_PHB04 is a new member of the family Myoviridae. In addition, polymerase chain reaction-based detection of phage genes in phageresistant B. bronchiseptica variants revealed no evidence of lysogenic activity of phage vB_BbrM_PHB04.",

It is one of the primary causative agents of infectious respiratory diseases such as swine pneumonia and atrophic rhinitis [1] . In addition, B. bronchiseptica is often isolated in combination with other pathogens from swine suffering from pneumonia. Previous studies have shown that co-infection of viral and bacterial pathogens, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida, and Streptococcus suis, exacerbates the severity of respiratory disease in pigs [2] . Importantly, human B. bronchiseptica infections have also been reported [3, 4] .",

Different virulence factors are expressed in the three different B. bronchiseptica phases: the bvg + , bvg i , and bvg \u2212 phases. In the virulent bvg + phase, which occurs at 37 \u00b0C in the absence of MgSO 4 and nicotinic acid, B. bronchiseptica can rapidly colonize the respiratory tract of its host through the expression of adhesins, autotransporters, and toxins. The avirulent bvg \u2212 phase occurs at growth temperatures of ~25 \u00b0C or in the presence of MgSO 4 or nicotinic acid. Finally, the intermediate (bvg i ) phase is responsible for biofilm formation by B. bronchiseptica [5, 6] .",

To combat multidrug-resistant bacteria, phages offer a potential alternative to antibiotics. In the past, temperate B. bronchiseptica phages have been induced in clinical bacterial strains, but their phenotypic characteristics have rarely been described. Petrovic et al [8] . isolated 29 lytic B. bronchiseptica phages from the environment and described their phenotypic characteristics; however, the genomes of these phages were only partially sequenced to determine whether they were lytic or temperate phages. Here, we isolated a novel lytic phage from wastewater collected from a swine farm in China and studied its phenotypic and genetic characteristics. To our knowledge, the complete genomes of only three temperate B. bronchiseptica phages have been sequenced [9] . ",

The assembly of the random library of sequences yielded a closed, circular genome by means of SOAPdenovo. The complete linear, doublestranded DNA genome of phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 consisted of 94,005 bp, with a GC content of 65.5% (Fig 4) . BLASTn analysis revealed that the genome of phage vB_ BbrM_PHB04 showed the highest nucleotide identity (82%, though only 1% coverage) to the genome sequence of Burkholderia phage strain KACC 11889. This low sequence similarity suggested that phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 is a novel species. The genome contained 124 putative open reading frames (ORFs), and tRNA prediction, conducted using tRNAscan-SE analysis, identified three tRNA encoding genes: tRNA-Met-CAT, tRNA-Asn-GTT, and tRNA-Pro-TGG (Fig 4) . The predicted ORFs encoding proteins with known functions were classified into three groups: those associated with morphogenesis and structure, those associated with DNA replication and metabolism, and those associated with lysis or lysogeny (Fig 4) . Proteins involved in structure and assembly were encoded by genes in the phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 genome. BLASTn analysis of these regions, including the baseplate (ORF3), major tail sheath (ORF12), major capsid protein (ORF20), and tail fiber protein (ORF119, ORF121, ORF122, and ORF124), showed low identity to the corresponding proteins in other phage (Fig 4; Table S1 ). Genes encoding DNA replication and regulation modules such as the helicase (ORF25), DNA primase (ORF98), ssDNA-binding protein (ORF101), and RecD-like DNA helicase (ORF112) were located in the middle of the phage vB_BbrM_PHB04 genome (Fig 4) . However, all of these sequences showed only low levels of identity to genes encoding phage proteins of similar function. Additionally, we identified 96 genes of unknown function. With respect to lysis or lysogeny modules, ORF117 encoded a protein with 56% amino acid sequence identity to the endolysin protein of Pseudomonas phage LkO4 (Fig 4; Table S2 ). Holin, a protein that forms large holes in the cytoplasmic membrane of phage-infected bacteria is encoded by ORF118, showed 42% amino acid sequence identity to the holin protein from Pseudomonas phage LkO4 (Fig 4; Table S2 ). In addition, the protein encoded by ORF8 contained domains from multiple families, including LT_GEWL, SLT, MitE, PRK11619, and DUF3584 (Fig 4; Table S2 ). Proteins LT_GEWL and SLT belong to the lysozyme-like superfamily, all members of which participate in the hydrolysis of \u03b2-1,4-linked polysaccharides.",
