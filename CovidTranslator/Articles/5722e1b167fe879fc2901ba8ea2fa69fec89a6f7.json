            "text": "The filoviruses Marburg virus and Ebola virus (EBOV) quickly outpace host immune responses and cause hemorrhagic fever, resulting in case fatality rates as high as 90% in humans and nearly 100% in nonhuman primates. The development of an effective therapeutic for EBOV is a daunting public health challenge and is hampered by a paucity of knowledge regarding filovirus pathogenesis. This report describes a successful strategy for interfering with EBOV infection using antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). A combination of EBOV-specific PMOs targeting sequences of viral mRNAs for the viral proteins (VPs) VP24, VP35, and RNA polymerase L protected rodents in both pre-and post-exposure therapeutic regimens. In a prophylactic proof-of-principal trial, the PMOs also protected 75% of rhesus macaques from lethal EBOV infection. The work described here may contribute to development of designer, ''druggable'' countermeasures for filoviruses and other microbial pathogens.

Although the worst outbreaks have resulted in only several hundred deaths worldwide [3] [4] [5] [6] , the filoviruses are considered a significant global health threat, because as the reservoir remains unknown, the pathogen is extremely deadly and highly infectious by aerosol, and there is anecdotal evidence that the use of both MARV and EBOV were explored as potential biowarfare agents in the offensive program of the former Soviet Union [7] [8] [9] [10] . The filoviruses are relatively simple viruses of 19-Kb genomes and consist of seven genes which encode nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein, four smaller viral proteins (VPs) (VP24, VP30, VP35, and VP40), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), all in a single strand of negative-sensed RNA [11] .",

Although there has been significant progress toward vaccine development via demonstration of protection in nonhuman primates from EBOV illness and death [12, 13] , a vaccine will not fulfill all requirements for EBOV countermeasures. Administration of type I interferons, therapeutic vaccines, immune globulins, ribavirin, and other nucleoside analogues have been somewhat successful in rodent EBOV models, but all failed to benefit EBOV-infected nonhuman primates [1, 14, 15] . EBOV frequently causes severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, and administration of a recombinant clotting inhibitor was recently shown to protect 33% of rhesus monkeys [16] . It appears that host-directed consequence management of the disease alone may not be sufficient, and an additional well-orchestrated sequence-specific attack on viral replication may be more effective as a successful anti-filovirus treatment regimen.",

Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are a subclass of antisense agents modified to include a phosphorodiamidate linkage and morpholine ring, and exhibit limited off-target effects, favorable base stacking, high duplex stability, high solubility, cell permeability, and no hybridization complexities [20, 21] . Formation of a PMO:mR-NA duplex can effectively block translation of viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral replication [22, 23] . Antisense PMO are effective as antivirals against vesiviruses [24] , flaviviruses [23, 25] , and the SARS coronavirus [26] . The successful inhibition of viral replication by PMOs in these reports was demonstrated in vitro, but has not yet been shown in an animal model.",

In order to test our hypothesis, PMOs were designed to inhibit translation of the mRNAs for EBOV VP35, VP24, and L ( Figure 1A ). These EBOV-specific PMOs demonstrated sequence-specific inhibition when compared with a PMO molecule with a MARV-specific sequence or PMOs containing EBOV-scrambled sequences in a reporter-based in vitro translation assay ( Figure 1B-1D ). No inhibition was observed for the scrambled or nonspecific PMO at up to 10 lM concentration for the EBOV VP24, VP35, or L RNA targets ( Figure 1B-1D ). To determine whether the EBOV-specific PMOs could reduce viral propagation in vitro, VeroE6 cells were pretreated with the PMOs at a concentration of 20 lM and then infected with a multiplicity of infection of 1. Treatment with the EBOV VP24-, VP35-, or L-specific PMO was able to consistently reduce the viral titers in the EBOVinfected VeroE6 cells ( Figure 1E ). A combination of the three PMOs also reduced the viral titers in the VeroE6 cells, but did not show an enhanced effect as compared with treatment with any one of the PMOs ( Figure 1E ). In the same assay, the viral titers in the scrambled PMO-treated cells were nearly identical to those observed in untreated VeroE6 cells, and the PMOs did not cause obvious cytotoxicity at concentrations used in this assay (unpublished data).",

            "text": "To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the EBOV-specific PMOs, we first determined the survival of mice treated with individual PMOs at 24 h and 4 h before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units (pfu) of mouse-adapted EBOV. The three PMOs exhibited a wide range of efficacy against lethal EBOV infection. Both the VP24-and VP35-specific PMOs provided nearly complete protection when the mice were pretreated twice with 500 lg doses (Figure 2A -2B, p , 0.001 for both VP24 and VP35 PMO treatment versus PBS treatment). In contrast, and despite its strong activity in the cell-free translation assay, the L-specific PMO conferred survival to ;30% of treated mice at the 500-lg dose ( Figure  2C , p \u00bc 0.5 for both doses of the L PMO compared with PBStreated mice). As expected, treatment of the mice with a Marburg-specific VP24, VP35, or L PMO did not provide protection against EBOV (Figure 2A-2C ). Next, we investigated whether a combination of all these PMOs could further enhance efficacy. We found that when the VP24-, VP35-, and L-specific PMOs were administered together at 24 h and 4 h before lethal EBOV challenge, this resulted in robust protection at all the doses tested ( Figure 2D , p \u00bc 0.00001, 0.001, and 0.0136, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-lg EBOV-specific PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). To investigate the usefulness of the PMO in a post-exposure regimen, mice were treated with a single dose of the three PMOs administered 24 h after EBOV infection ( Figure 2E ). The PMO-treated EBOV-infected mice were fully protected at the 500-lg doses, and at lower doses the post-challenge treatment provided enhanced protection (p \u00bc 0.00001, 0.0136, and 0.2105, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-lg PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). Mice receiving a single PMO treatment 4 h before infection showed similar protection (p \u00bc 0.00001, 0.237, and 1.0, respectively, for the 500-, 50-, and 5-lg PMO-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice). Here, a single dose of PMO at 24 hpi was used and, at the highest concentration, the combination of PMOs completely protected EBOV-infected mice. In this single-dose therapeutic regimen, the lower PMO dosages did not provide complete protection. It may be possible that repeated injections of lower concentrations of EBOV-specific PMOs could provide equivalent protection to fewer administrations of higher amounts. Importantly, multiple injections (n . 5) of nonspecific PMOs did not enhance survival of EBOV-infected rodents (unpublished data).",

There are currently no available vaccines or therapeutics to treat EBOV infection. To date, multiple pre-and post-exposure therapeutic strategies, primarily focused on bolstering the host immune response or inhibiting viral replication, have been undertaken with limited success. Here, Bavari and colleagues report the development of a successful therapeutic regimen for EBOV infection based on antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs). PMOs are a subclass of chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides that interfere with the translation of viral mRNA, thus inhibiting viral amplification. Using a cell-free translation system, a cell-based assay, and survival studies in rodents, we identified several efficacious EBOV-specific PMOs. Further, prophylactic administration of a combination of three EBOV-specific PMOs specifically targeting VP24, VP35, and the viral polymerase L protected rhesus macaques from lethal EBOV infection. This is the first successful antiviral intervention against filoviruses in nonhuman primates. These findings may serve as the basis for a new strategy to quickly develop virus-specific therapies in defense against known, emerging, and genetically engineered bioterrorism threats.",

An initial study tested the efficacy of the VP35 PMO, the compound that exhibited the highest activity in mice. Unfortunately, all of the VP35 PMOtreated monkeys, as well as the untreated control monkey, died within the time-to-death expected for EBOV-infected rhesus macaques (days 7, 7, 8, 8, and 7, respectively). In contrast, treatment of rhesus macaques with a combination of the VP24, VP35, and L PMOs showed substantial efficacy. Two PMO-treated monkeys survived the EBOV challenge with few clinical signs beyond mild depression from days 6-9 ( Figure  6B) . A third PMO-treated monkey cleared the EBOV infection and remained aviremic from days 9-14 ( Figure   6C ), but died of a severe bacterial infection, with no evidence of ongoing EBOV infection, on day 16 ( Figure 6B , unpublished data). The fourth PMO-treated monkey succumbed to EBOV infection on day 10 ( Figure 6B ). Three na\u00efve control monkeys used in this experiment received no treatment and succumbed to EBOV infection on days 7, 9, and 10. Since the VP35 PMO alone did not provide any protection to nonhuman primates, these data suggest that a combination of PMOs is more efficacious than a single-target PMO treatment and also suggests that protection in the combination PMOtreated monkeys is not due to nonspecific effects of PMO administration.",

Since the surviving PMO-treated monkeys had low to undetectable viremias following infection, we assessed the immune responses of the surviving monkeys. By 28 d after EBOV challenge, the surviving rhesus monkeys had high levels of both anti-EBOV antibodies and T cell responses, similar to the PMO-protected mice (unpublished data). Discussion EBOV infections represent a significant public health threat, with no reliable effective chemotherapeutics. Our current studies indicate the effectiveness of PMOs targeted to specific EBOV mRNAs against in vitro, rodent, and nonhuman primate EBOV infections. The data presented here are in line with our working hypothesis that a combination of PMOs that target multiple viral genes can slow EBOV replication, allowing enough time for development of antiviral immune responses and viral clearance.",

Using VeroE6 cells we showed that EBOV replication was moderately suppressed in cells treated with EBOV-specific PMOs. However, no visible difference was observed when comparing the ability of a single PMO and the combination of three PMOs to reduce viral growth. The PMOs used in these studies were not conjugated with peptides that facilitate cellular uptake. We have observed lower cellular uptake of naked PMOs compared with peptideconjugated PMOs by Vero E6 cells (unpublished data), and this may explain the moderate inhibition observed in the in vitro replication assay. Nonetheless, the data summarized in Figure 1 clearly indicate the feasibility of specific gene targeting by unconjugated PMO and the favorable antiviral activity of these compounds.",

Following parenteral injection, PMOs are cleared from the bloodstream within hours, but accumulate and remain within tissues such as spleen and liver for days (unpublished data). By administering PMO after challenge, it is likely that higher concentrations were available in the circulation and tissues during the peak of viral replication. Thus, the PMOs may have been able to reduce amplification of EBOV during this critical timeframe, allowing development of appropriate host immune responses to the otherwise lethal viral infection [27] [28] [29] . Since effective treatment seemed to require critical timing of PMO administration, and nonhuman primates are highly sensitive to EBOV infection, we decided to both pretreat and administer daily doses of PMOs after viral challenge in the proof-of-concept nonhuman primate studies. While short-term stability in vivo is an unfavorable property for a potential therapeutic, it should be noted that for a deadly acute infection that has only a short period of treatment in the clinic, repeated administration of a lifesaving drug is entirely feasible. Along these lines, future studies may show that the pharmacokinetics of PMO can be enhanced by other modifications or alternative routes of administration or regimen to improve efficacy.",

C57BL/6 mice, aged 8-10 wk, of both sexes, were obtained from the National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center (Frederick, Maryland, United States). Mice were housed in microisolator cages and provided autoclaved water and chow ad libitum. Mice were challenged by intraperitoneal injection with ;1,000 pfu of mouse-adapted EBOV diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) [30] . Unless otherwise noted, mice were treated 23 at 24 h and 4 h prior to EBOV challenge with 0.5 mg, 0.05, or 0.005 mg of each of the EBOV or MARV VP24, VP35, and L PMOs, a combination of PMOs, or an unrelated PMO. In one presented study, the PMOs (0.5, 0.05, or 0.005 mg) were administered in a single dose 4 h before or 24 h after challenge. Previously, we showed Ebola viruslike particles given 24 h before viral challenge protects mice from lethal EBOV infection. Therefore, for comparison of post-challenge immune responses, a group of mice was injected with virus-like particles 24 h before EBOV challenge [15] . C57BL/6 mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 1,000 plaque-forming units of mouse-adapted EBOV [30] .",

Plasmids containing 150 nucleotides encompassing the PMO target area from EBOV VP24, VP35, or L fused to firefly luciferase were used to generate RNA. Inhibition of the VP24, VP35, or L RNA targets was assessed using in vitro translation reactions containing different concentrations of PMO targeting EBOV () or MARV (&) VP24, VP35, or L, respectively, or a scrambled (m) PMO, along with the respective RNA.
