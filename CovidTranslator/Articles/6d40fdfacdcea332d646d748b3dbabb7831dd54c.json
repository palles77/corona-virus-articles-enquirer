            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) LJB/03 was isolated from the fece of piglets infected with PEDV on a pig farm, Heilongjiang province, China. The M gene of LJB/03 was amplified from the RNA extracted directly from the fece samples by RT-PCR and cloned into pMD18-T vector. The M gene cDNA was sequenced and encompasses an open reading frame of 681 nucleotides, encoding a 226-amino acid protein. The LJB/03 M gene has a base composition of 152 adenines (22%), 153 cytosines (23%), 161 guanines (24%), and 214 thymines (31%). Sequence comparison with other PEDV strains selected from GenBank revealed that the LJB/03 M gene has a high sequence homology to those of other PEDV isolates, 97.80% with JMe2, 96.92% with KPEDV-9 (Korean field isolate), 97.36% with KPEDV-9 (Korean), 97.80% with Br1/87, and 97.94% with CV777. The encoded protein shared 97.79% amino acid identities compared with CV777, 97.35% with Br1/87, 97.79% with JMe2, 96.90% with KPEDV-9 (Korean field isolate), 96.46% with KPEDV-9 (Korean). Sequence analysis of the M gene, including genetic distance measurement, phylogenetic tree analysis, and residue substitution analysis, showed that all other PED viruses analyzed fell into three groups, and the LJB/03 itself branched in an independent group. These data revealed that the M gene nucleotide sequence of LJB/03 has some mutations in comparison with the other PED viruses.",

The mortality can be high up to 90% in 1-2 weeks old piglets [5] [6] [7] . Pigs of all ages are susceptible to the disease. PED was first reported in England in 1971 (8) . Since then, the disease was reported in several pig farming countries, such as Germany, Canada, Japanese, Korea, France, Belgium, Switzerland, etc. [9] [10] [11] . In 1976, the disease was first reported in China (12) , and it has become one of the severe viral diarrhea diseases that lead to a severe economic loss in pig farming. Therefore it is important to prevent and control the disease. However, because of the similarity between PED and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in clinical syndrome and pathology, there has no effective diagnostic methods to distinguish one from another accurately, and there also has no effective vaccine developed to prevent the disease in China.",

It possesses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (5, 17) . Viral proteins such as spike S (180-220 kDa), membrane M (27-32 kDa) and nucleocapsid N (55-58 kDa) [17] [18] [19] [20] are translated from its subgenomic mRNA. The M protein is a structural membrane glycoprotein. It plays an important role in the assembly process of viral nucleocapsid and membrane. The M glycoprotein can neutralize anti-M antibody with the present of complement (3) . It also can stimulate the production of -interferon (IFN). Therefore, the M gene will be an ideal candidate for cloning and expression in the development of genetically engineered vaccines to prevent PED. However, no nucleotide sequence of PEDV strains isolated in China has been reported until now. The aim of present study was to determine the complement nucleotide sequence of the PEDV M gene.",
