Although known since 1970 the agent has not been convincingly demonstrated by tissue culture, electron microscopy or specific serological technique (8, i3, 16) . PED is considered to be a new-disease with characteristic clinical signs and pleural effusion as the typical post mortem finding (1, 16) . The infection is characterized by a long lasting viraemia and formation of antibodies which appear to have only little neutralizing capacity (4, 16) . However, there is clinical protection to re-infection after the fourth week (1) .",

PED emerged between 10 and 20 years later as a cause of intercurrent rabbit mortality in a number of TPI laboratories.
