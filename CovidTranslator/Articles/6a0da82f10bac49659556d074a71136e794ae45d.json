The model builds on the recognition that public health is everybody's business and therefore, needs a common definitional base. Different levels of skill and a wide range of contributions are needed if public health programmes are to make the most impact. The different domains of practice help to construct a basis for understanding the necessary elements of the public health system and their interactions.",

Population approaches to promoting health and preventing disease are on many agendas both nationally and locally. In his introduction to the National Health Service (NHS) Improvement Plan for England, the Prime Minister says: \"A greater emphasis will be given in the NHS to public health, to prevent illnesses and not just treat them\". 2 This policy shift at the highest political level is welcome, but the greater profile and accompanying higher expectation creates challenges for public health professionals, increasing to unprecedented levels the demand for public health skills not only within the NHS workforce but also across other sectors, particularly local government.

Similar moves were made in Wales. However welcome a recognition of the need for public health, this 'is spreading resources very thinly' although 'there is a welcome move to broaden the skill base by introducing nonmedical specialists'. 3 GATC has created the new Health Protection Agency (HPA). The HPA has integrated national resources for control of communicable disease and response to chemical and radiological incidents, and provided a focus for response to bioterrorism. The impact has been to fragment the previously integrated public health structures at local level. Consultants in communicable disease are no longer part of local public health departments and, in some instances, there are considerable strains between generalists and health protection specialists, particularly where capacity is stretched.",

He argues that rather than being 'done unto', individuals need to 'fully engage' in their health choices. 13 This emphasis on choice reflects current political philosophy, with the debate between individual choice and state intervention highlighting the tension within the political arena about how much can be achieved by government without accusation of 'nanny-statism', and how much needs to be left to individual choice. 'Choosing Health' explores this move toward personalization of healthy choices, also reflecting the need to reduce health inequalities by addressing access to choices, more information and partnerships within communities.",

This particular use of the domains could be argued to be country specific because it applies to the organizational basis of practice. However, we would suggest that the approach is not only specific to England. It could be applied to population programmes such as reducing tobacco-related harm in China or chlamydia screening in Sweden which take account of the need to promote healthier lifestyles, to protect the public through surveillance and reducing exposure risk, as well as ensuring that there are services for prevention as well as treatment (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "Case study: Delivering teenage pregnancy as a public health programme Many young people are successful in adapting to the role of parenthood and have happy, healthy children. For too many, however, unplanned teenage pregnancy and early motherhood is associated with low educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social isolation and poverty. For the very young with little personal or financial support, pregnancy can cause considerable distress, not only for the young person concerned, but also for their families. The closer one approaches the issue, the more it becomes clear that there is no easy technical 'fix' that can be applied. Consequently, activities to tackle teenage pregnancy have to be across sectors and to be multifaceted; anything that is done needs to involve and be understandable to the vulnerable young people themselves. They need to tackle: \u2020 low expectations-it is more common in disadvantaged groups with poor expectations of education or jobs. In the UK, there were more teenagers who saw no prospect of a job or thought they would end up on benefits anyway. Put simply-they see no reason not to get pregnant: \u2020 Ignorance-young people lack accurate knowledge about contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, what to expect in relationships and what it means to be a parent. Only around half of those under 16 years of age and two-thirds of those aged 16-19 years use contraception when they start to have sex: and \u2020 mixed messages-sex is a staple diet of modern media. Sometimes it may appear to teenagers that sex is compulsory, but contraception, which infrequently receives acknowledgement in the media, is illegal. Mixed messages between the media and parental embarrassment leads not to less sex but to less protected sex (Fig. 3) . The three domains can help to frame both the actions needed and those who need to be engaged in constructing the public health programme (Table 1 ).",

However, different levels of skill and a wide range of contributions are needed if public health programmes are to make the most impact. The different domains of practice help to construct a basis for understanding the necessary elements of the public health system and the still mix needed.
