We included 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV during the 2015 outbreak in Korea. Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected prospectively. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in serial serum samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All patients presented with fever. The median time to defervescence was 18 days. Nine patients required oxygen supplementation and classified into severe group. In the severe group, chest infiltrates suddenly began to worsen around day 7 of illness, and dyspnea developed at the end of the first week and became apparent in the second week. Median time from symptom onset to oxygen supplementation was 8 days. The severe group had higher neutrophil counts during week 1 than the mild group (4,500 vs. 2,200/\u00b5L, P = 0.026). In the second week of illness, the severe group had higher serum levels of IL-6 (54 vs. 4 pg/mL, P = 0.006) and CXCL-10 (2,642 vs. 382 pg/mL, P < 0.001). IFN-\u03b1 response was not observed in mild cases. Our data shows that clinical condition may suddenly deteriorate around 7 days of illness and the serum levels of IL-6 and CXCL-10 was significantly elevated in MERS-CoV patients who developed severe diseases.",

The outbreak was amplified by superspreading events in hospitals and resulted in 186 laboratory-confirmed cases with 38 fatalities, the largest outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula (4, 5) . Factors contributing to the large hospital outbreaks included delay in diagnosis of the index case, overcrowding in emergency departments, movements of patients prior to diagnoses, and suboptimal infection prevention and control (6) . During the outbreak, almost 17,000 individuals with an epidemiologic risk were quarantined for monitoring, and all the lab-oratory-confirmed cases were admitted to the hospitals for isolation as soon as the diagnoses were made. Consequently, the Korean outbreak provided a unique opportunity to conduct prospective studies on MERS-CoV infection.",

To better understand immunopathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection, we assessed host immune responses to and viral kinetics of MERS-CoV infection. We recently reported the viral shedding kinetics (10) and antibody response kinetics (11) .

Dyspnea requiring oxygen supplementation and sudden progression of pneumonia usually developed during the second week. Similar to SARS (16), the median time from symptom onset to ventilator support was 11 days.

Subsequent studies from Saudi Arabia reported almost half of the patients with MERS required renal replacement therapy (17) (18) (19) . In this study, excluding Patient E who had metastatic bladder cancer with urinary obstruction, only one patient showed acute kidney injury. This striking difference in the incidence of renal impairment is likely due to the low prevalence of underlying conditions such as chronic renal diseases, diabetes and hypertension in our population. Evasion from immune system in humans is critical for MERS-CoV to survive and replicate in the host. MERS-CoV is known to inhibit recognition, delay IFN induction, and sequester IFN stimulated gene production until after peak viral titers had been achieved (20) . In a fatal MERS case, the patient could not induce the expression of key receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) in response to MERS-CoV infection (21) . This resulted in a decreased expression of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and IRF-7 leading to a decreased expression of IFN-\u03b1. In our study, the serum levels of IFN-\u03b1 in the severe MERS group was more frequently high than the mild group, even if we could not demonstrate any statistical significance. To the contrary, there was no apparent IFN-\u03b1 response in the mild group ( Fig.  2A) . The level of IFN-\u03b1 was also correlated with the log value of maximal RNA copies (Fig. 3A) . Taken together, IFN-\u03b1 seems to surge during the clinical course of MERS in patients having severe disease with high viral loads but not in patients having mild disease. The absence of INF-\u03b1 surge in severe cases of disease was related to worse outcome in previous study (21) , but we could not conclude the association of outcome with the serum level of IFN-\u03b1 due to a limited number of fatal cases. Moreover, it is possible that the levels of serum INF-\u03b1 merely reflected the level of exogenously injected pegylated IFN-\u03b12a in this study. Therefore, the results of levels of serum INF-\u03b1 should be read cautiously.",

            "text": "While IL-6 is one of the important proinflammatory cytokines having diverse biological activities in many clinical situations including respiratory viral infections, the change of serum IL-6 level during MERS-CoV infection has not been clearly documented yet. Increases in serum IL-6 during early phase of respiratory viral infections was revealed in human cases of severe seasonal influenza (22) , pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pneumonia (23) , and fatal A/H7N9 avian influenza (8, 24) . In case of SARS-CoV infections, elevated levels of IL-6 subsequent to the peak viral replication were observed in all of 8 pneumonia cases included (13) . IL-6 was induced in MERS-CoV-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (25) and was significantly upregulated in the lung lesions of the MERS-CoV-infected animals (26) . In our study, overall IL-6 levels were not significantly higher in the severe MERS group than in the mild group. However, IL-6 levels in the severe MERS group were higher during the 2nd and the 3rd week after symptom onset with statistical significance when we analyzed a temporal trend (Supplementary Fig. 2) . CXCL-10, also known as IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), is a chemoattractant which is expressed in inflammed bronchial epithelial cells in response to IFN-\u03b3. CXCL-10 seems to play an important role in severe respiratory viral illnesses. Uncontrolled durable secretion of CXCL-10, after the first week following the onset of symptoms was associated with poor outcome in a severe MERS case (21) . High serum level of CXCL-10 was also documented in other severe respiratory viral illnesses such as severe A/H7N9 avian influenza (24) , A/H5N1 avian influenza (7), severe seasonal influenza (22) , and SARS (9) . In this study the levels of serum CXCL-10 were significantly higher in the severe MERS group than in the mild group in the second and third week of illness ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . During the clinical course, the serum levels of CXCL-10 and IL-6 showed a peak around second week after symptom onset in the severe group (Fig. 2C ). This dynamic in proinflammatory cytokine response shows a good temporal correlation with chest infiltrates showing a peak at second weeks after symptom onset in severe MERS cases. Therefore, our study suggests that elevated levels of serum IL-6 and CXCL-10 may be associated with the severity of pneumonia in MERS.",

Small numbers of patients were included and five patients had concurrent infectious diseases, which might affect the clinical course and laboratory features of MERS-CoV infection. Nine patients received pegylated INF-\u03b12a, which could affect serum level of INF-\u03b1 and other cytokine profiles through cytokine feedback cascades. However, in each group the IL-6 and CXCL-10 profiles were similar regardless of the administration of pegylated INF-\u03b12a. Also subset analysis including the patients who did not received interferon therapy showed similar trends ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). In spite of these limitations, this study has strengths in that we collected clinical data and serum samples serially in prospective manner and diverse cytokine or chemokine levels were measured in this newly emerging disease.",
