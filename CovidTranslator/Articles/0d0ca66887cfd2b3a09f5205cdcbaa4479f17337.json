The nearly full-length S1 subunit of the spike gene phylogeny of selected strains, however, split up this grouping, suggesting potential recombination in the S1 gene. In order to clarify this, various bioinformatic analyses of the strains were carried out, which confirmed this supposition. Two patterns of recombination were found among the strains, one of which could also be identified in GenBank-deposited IBV sequences from the region. These findings demonstrate that IBV strains of different recombinant patterns occur simultaneously in the same geographic region and could circulate for an extended period of time, thus contributing to the knowledge on IBV evolution.",

It is caused by the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Jackwood, Hall and Handel 2012; Jackwood and de Wit 2013) . Some strains of IBV are strongly nephropathogenic, and may cause nephrosis-nephritis, urolithiasis, and mortality (Jackwood and de Wit 2013) . The disease occurs worldwide and pose significant economic burden to the poultry industry. Protection against the disease mainly relies on vaccination, which, however, is complicated by the high mutation rate and recombinations in the viral genome, especially when these affect immunologically important epitopes, such as the ones present in the spike viral glycoprotein (S) gene (Thor et al. 2011; Jackwood, Hall and Handel 2012) . As a result, several genotypes and serotypes of IBV exist and evolve over time, some of which persist and spread, while others disappear shortly. This variation undermines vaccinal protection against IB due to insufficient or the lack of cross-protection between the serotypes.",

In the routine, the PCR-based detection of IBV is best achieved by targeting a conservative region of the viral genome, such as the 5 0 UTR (Callison et al. 2006) , followed by a 'characterizing' assay, which targets a region that allows genotyping upon nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.

In the partial and the nearly complete S1 gene phylogeny the strains grouped in a different way, suggestive of potential recombination in the background. Therefore, the sequences were analysed for signs of recombination. This analysis revealed two groups of the sequences, which contained characteristic recombination patterns. The first detection occurred in 2010 and has continued since then up to the last submission of concerned sequences (end of 2015).

As a consequence, diagnosis and control of IB is a rather challenging task. Improving vaccination efficiency and understanding IBV evolution better requires the knowledge and characterization of circulating IBV variants in a given region. Virus isolation and molecular assays mutually complement each other and should be used for the detection and especially for characterization of IBV. However, the latter needs careful interpretation, because different portions of the same gene might belong to different phylogenetic cluster, as a result of recombination events. Since the S1 glycoprotein determines the serotype of IBV, and contains virus-neutralizing epitopes, its gene is the most frequently targeted subject for IBV characterization. One favoured approach was published by Capua et al. (1999) , that targets relatively conserved region of the S1 gene but still delivers relevant information for typing of IBV strains. However, if affected by recombination events outside the flanking region of this primer pair, the phylogenetic relations might change.",

The reported \"variant 2\" strains grouped together with those we have detected since 2010 in Egypt by the same protocol, and designated as the \"D1456-like\" group, which showed separation from the Israeli variant genetic group. The rest of the Egyptian isolates reported by the above referred authors (Abdel-Moneim, Afifi, and El-Kady 2012) belonged to the Israeli variant 2 strains (called \"variant 1\" by the same authors). These findings support the need for a uniform nomenclature of IBVs to avoid misunderstandings among researchers, diagnosticians, as expressed by the current European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action FA1207 (http://cost-con Shaded areas indicate confidence intervals of breakpoint positions (light grey: 99%, dark grey: 95%). Putative major parents are: 720/99 IL and D888/0/08 IR for D1456/1/ 5/10EG and D1795/2/7/11EG, respectively; putative minor parents are: D274 for both D1456/1/5/10EG and D1795/2/7/11EG. trollingaviancoronaviruses.org/) also, and as proposed recently by Valastro et al. (2016) . The near complete S1 gene phylogeny of the representative D1456-like strains showed a certain separation, which was explained by the revealed recombination events in the gene both by breakpoint and network analysis. Two types of recombinants were identified, represented by four and two strains of our collection, which affected two or one antigenic domain of the S1 gene, respectively. This presumably has immunological consequences. Such a phenomenon, when a 793/B serotype strain shifted to H120 serotype due to recombination of the 5 0 terminal of the S1 gene was recently reported (Zhang et al. 2015) . This aspect can best be investigated in relevant animal trials. Nevertheless, the finding that geographically and temporarily related sequences, which were deposited in the GenBank, showed the same recombination pattern that was revealed for the D1456-like viruses, thus further confirming the occurrence of this type of IBVs.",

Although no experimental evidences were obtained yet concerning their immunologic and pathogenic characteristics, the recombinants appeared viable and fit to survive and circulate in the successive chicken populations over the years. Thus, our findings contributed to the chronicle of the emergence and perseverance of recombinant IBVs in the field. Furthermore, the results provide a good example of the potential \"pitfalls\" of using a rather \"narrow-ranged\" diagnostic PCR, because viruses grouping together in certain phylogenetic trees might differ substantially in other genetic regions, or even immunologically, for example in serological tests. Or the opposite, viruses of the same serotype might have atypical genetic composition, aside of the neutralizing epitopes (Cavanagh et al. 1990 ).",
