Many such lineages consist of viruses newly discovered by 194 metaviromics, are not yet formally classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of 195 Viruses (ICTV), and therefore, cannot be assigned formal names. For the purpose of the present 196 work, we adopted a semi-arbitrary naming scheme using the following approach. 1) We use 197 taxon names that have been fully accepted by the ICTV as of March 2018 (47) whenever 198 possible. These names are recognizable through their capitalization and italicization and rank-199 specific suffixes (e.g., -virales for orders, -viridae for families). As is the common practice in 200 virus taxonomy, the officially classified members of each ICTV-approved taxon are referred to 201 via vernaculars (recognizable through their lack of capitalization and italicization). For instance, 202 the members of the ICTV-approved order Bunyavirales are called bunyaviruses, whereas those 203 of the family Tombusviridae are called tombusviruses. However, in this work, both taxon and 204 vernacular terms are to be understood sensu lato: if our analysis indicates certain viruses to be 205 members of or very closely related to an ICTV-established taxon, we consider them members of 206 that taxon despite the lack of current ICTV recognition.

These replicons consist of a single RdRp gene (Fig.  299 2B) and replicate either in mitochondria or in the cytosol of the host cells, respectively, of fungal 300 and invertebrate hosts (the latter hosts were identified in metaviromic holobiont analyses) (14, 301 53) . Recently, the existence of plant \"mitoviruses\" has been reported although it is not known 302 whether these viruses reproduce in the mitochondria (54). The \"narnavirus\" RdRp is also the 303 ancestor of the RdRp of the expanding group of \"ourmiaviruses\" (Figure 2A ). \"Ourmiaviruses\" 304 were originally identified in a narrow range of plants, and genomic analysis revealed the 305 chimeric nature of these viruses, with a \"narnavirus\"-like RdRp but SJR-CPs and movement 306 proteins (MPs) which were apparently acquired from \"picorna-like\" and \"tombus-like\" viruses, 307 respectively (55). Use of metaviromics has led to the identification of numerous related viruses 308 associated with invertebrates, many of which encode distinct SJR-CP variants and some of which 309 acquired an RNA helicase ( Figure 2B and S2) (14) . Thus, the evolution of this branch apparently 310 involved the loss of the structural module of leviviruses, which yielded naked RNA replicons 311 that reproduced in the mitochondria of early eukaryotes. A group of these replicons subsequently 312 escaped to the cytosol which was followed by the reacquisition of unrelated structural modules 313 from distinct lineages of eukaryotic viruses inhabiting the same environment ( Figure 2B The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/451740 doi: bioRxiv preprint groups that were previously considered peripheral members of this supergroup, such as 320 totiviruses and nodaviruses, were relocated to different branches in the present tree (Branches 4 321 and 3, respectively), whereas the viruses of the order Nidovirales were moved inside Branch 2 322 from an uncertain position in the tree.

Of special 381 note is the gain of 3 distinct helicases in 3 clades within this branch: superfamily 3 helicases 382 (S3H) in members of Picornavirales, superfamily 2 helicases (S2H) in potyviruses, and 383 superfamily 1 helicases (S1H) in nidoviruses ( Figure 3B and S2B).

All branches show substantial host range diversity such that, for example, at half-distance 652 from root to leaves, all branches, except for Branch 1, retain at least half of the diversity (Figure  653 9). Furthermore, differences between the branches are substantial, with the highest entropy 654 observed in branches 4 (dsRNA viruses) and 5 (-RNA viruses).

At least in the case of 716 partiti-picobirnaviruses in Branch 2, the dsRNA virus (\"toti-like virus\") CP apparently displaced 717 the ancestral SJR-CP. However, this particular protein structure does not seem to be essential to 718 encapsidate a dsRNA genome: birnaviruses, whose provenance is uncertain due to the 719 permutation in their RdRps, retain SJR-CP, which is most closely related to SJR-CP of 720 nodaviruses and tetraviruses (19). An even more striking example of module shuffling is 721 presented by amalgaviruses, dsRNA viruses that group with partitiviruses in the RdRp tree but 722 encode a distant homolog of the nucleocapsid protein of -RNA bunyaviruses (111-114). More 723 generally, structural and replication modules have been repeatedly shuffled during the evolution 724 of +RNA viruses. Examples include displacement of the ancestral SJR-CP by a filamentous CP 725 in potyviruses and by a helical nucleocapsid protein in nidoviruses, and multiple cases of 726 displacement with rod-shaped-like CP and unique nucleocapsid proteins in Branch 3. Thus, 727",

However, comparison of genome architectures and phylogenetic analysis 346 suggested that hypoviruses are derivatives of potyviruses that have lost the capsid protein (63, 347 64). In the current RdRp tree, hypoviruses cluster with the dsRNA viruses of the partitivirus-348 picobirnavirus clade rather than with potyviruses (Figure 3). Whether this position is an artifact 349 of tree construction or whether hypoviruses actually share the RdRps with dsRNA viruses is 350 unclear. 351 The partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade within Branch 2 represents a transition to the bona fide 352 dsRNA Baltimore Class (Figure 3). Typical partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses have minimalist 353 genomes that consist of two dsRNA segments encapsidated separately into distinct 120-subunit 354 T=1 capsids (65-68). These genome segments encode, respectively, RdRps and CPs that are 355 clearly homologous between the two families. The CPs of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade 356have been suggested to be distantly related to those of other dsRNA viruses that belong to 357Branch 4 (33, 69).

Because the 464 RdRp tree topology implies that the alphavirus ancestor is more recent than the ancestor of 465 flaviviruses (Figure 1), such adoption of the NS3 protease for a structural role is suggestive of 466 emerging alphaviruses borrowing their structural module from preexisting flaviviruses (19). 467 The hallmark of Branch 3 is the capping enzyme (CapE), which is present in the entire 468 \"alphavirus supergroup\" and in flaviviruses (Figure 4 and S2B).

First, we ran 500 950 replicas with Infomap (136) (bipartite setting, using domains as factors) and built a similarity 951 matrix by assigning to each pair of nodes a similarity value equal to the fraction of replicas in 952 which both nodes were placed in the same module. Then, hierarchical clustering was performed 953 on the similarity matrix, setting the number of clusters equal to the median number of modules 954 obtained in the 500 replicas.

The 2nd-order network composed of 54 958 modules and 34 connector domains was searched for 2nd-order modules with Infomap (500 959 replicas, bipartite setting with connector domains as factors). Due to the small size of the 2nd-960 order network, consensus community detection did not qualitatively improve the results of the 961 search, and therefore we took the replica with the best Infomap score and skipped hierarchical 962 clustering for this and subsequent steps of the higher-order module search. After assessing 963 statistical significance with Oslom, 4 2nd-order modules were recovered, encompassing 12 of the 964 original modules associated with closely related virus families. A 3rd-order network was built by 965 pooling these 4 2nd-order modules withthe 46 modules that remained unmerged. The 3rd-order 966 network was analyzed in the same manner to obtain the 9 supermodules. None of these 967 supermodules was assessed as significant by Oslom. 968Quantification of virus host range diversity. Known hosts or, in case of viruses, isolated from 969 holobionts, virus sources were identified for 3,456 viruses. The host taxonomy (to the phylum 970 level) was mapped to the leaves of the combined tree. The tree was ultrametrized and the weights 971were computed for all leaves as described in (138). Each internal node of the tree, therefore, 972 defines a set of leaves with assigned hosts; the distribution of (weighted) relative frequencies of 973 hosts can be characterized by its Shannon entropy. Each leaf has one host defined, so the entropy 974 of the host range distribution is 0, whereas at the root the host diversity is maximal. The entropy 975 generally declines along the tree because viruses that belong to relatively shallow branches tend 976 to share their host ranges. The node depth vs node host range entropy data was averaged for each 977 All rights reserved.
