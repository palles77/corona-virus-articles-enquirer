However, we still have very limited understanding of the mechanisms that guide these interactions. Although the conceptual approaches to environmental genomics were established several decades ago, the tools are only now available to better define the mechanisms that underlie the interactions among these important etiological features of lung disease. In this article, we summarize recent insights in the environmental genomics (ecogenomics) of common nonmalignant respiratory diseases (asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory infections), describe the framework of geneenvironment interactions that inform the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases, and propose future research directions that will help translate scientific advances into public health gains.",

Approximately 11,000 liters of air move through the respiratory system daily, containing dust, fumes, microbes, aerosolized toxins, and pollutants. Therefore, environmental triggers have been long implicated as important factors in the etiology and pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. For example, investigators determined in the 1700s that grain dust is a cause of asthma, in the early 1900s that asbestos is a cause of lung cancer, and in the 1960s that cigarette smoke is a cause of emphysema. However, significantly variable individual susceptibility to environmental injury was quite obvious. For example, ~10% of grain workers develop asthma, <1% of asbestos-exposed workers develop mesothelioma, and 20% of cigarette smokers develop COPD. A likely explanation for this differing susceptibility is that host susceptibility factors interact with environmental triggers in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease. Many host (genetic) factors, which may contribute to the differing susceptibility between individuals, have been recently identified using genomic tools from a new discipline called environmental genomics or ecogenomics.",

The ultimate goals of ecogenomics are to identify subjects at risk for environmentally induced diseases, to characterize which environmental exposures lead to disease in susceptible individuals, to develop biomarkers for disease development, and to reduce the burden of environmentally induced disease using preventive and therapeutic measures based on scientific knowledge. Although the conceptual approaches to environmental genomics were established several decades ago, we are only now beginning to make significant scientific gains. In this review, we summarize recent ecogenomic insights into common respiratory diseases including asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory infections. These diseases are of significant public health importance in both developed and developing countries, and considerable research has been devoted to their pathogenesis. We demonstrate the complexity of gene-environment interactions in these respiratory diseases and describe how not only DNA polymorphisms, but also environmentally induced nongenetic DNA modifications (epigenetics), contribute to this field. Epigenetic mechanisms offer a new paradigm in the pathogenesis of disease and introduce a dynamic concept of gene-environment interactions that can be altered in an individual's lifetime and can affect the phenotype of the individual and also their offspring. Finally, using our summary of available knowledge and identification of scientific gaps, we suggest directions for future research.",

We now know that early in life, monozygotic twins are epigenetically identical, whereas older twin pairs have divergent epigenetic marks that are associated with differences in gene expression (35) . These findings suggest that life events such as environmental exposures can alter epigenetic marks that may account, in part, for phenotypic differences in twin pairs.

To date, 10 genome-wide linkage and association studies have been completed in families with asthma or asthma-related disorders; all but 4 chromosomes (X, 10, 18, and 22) have been implicated in the development of the disease (86) . Although there are some consistent results between different genome-wide screens, there are many more discrepancies. Genes for which association has been reported include ADBR2, HLA, TNFA, CD14, IL13, LTA, VDR, STAT6, NOS, ADAM33, and ORMDL3 (86) . Major, large-effect susceptibility genes for asthma have not been definitively identified (86) , and replications in separate study populations are lacking. We and others believe that these inconsistencies result from the complex clinical phenotype of asthma and consequent heterogeneity within the study populations, a polygenic pattern of inheritance, the substantial role of environmental exposures in the development and progression of asthma, and the possibility that epigenetic mechanisms play an important role (46) .",

However, dramatic increases in the prevalence, incidence, and severity of asthma suggest that diet, aeroallergens, smoking behavior, agents in the workplace, indoor and outdoor air pollution, viruses, domestic and occupational exposure to endotoxins, and immunization against certain infectious diseases play particularly important roles in etiology and pathogenesis of this condition (87); these increases have occurred too rapidly to be accounted for by changes in primary DNA sequence alone. Importantly, epigenetic mechanisms are influenced by environmental exposures (4, 35) , providing a vital interface between biology and environment.",

A recent study identified an association among asthma symptoms, cigarette smoke exposure, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several xenobiotic enzymes (EPHX1, CYP1B1, and CYP2D6) and demonstrated that specific patterns of allelic correlations among these genes were associated with an especially high risk for the development of asthma, suggesting that epistatic interactions can affect the metabolism of environmental toxicants and modulate exposure levels and asthmatic exacerbations (74) . This study is a good example of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions as disease modifiers. Several other studies have reported positive associations between SNPs in asthma-related genes such as GSTP1, GSTM1, TGF-beta1, CD14, IL13, ADRB2, or IL1RN and spirometric or symptomatic decline in response to environmental cigarette smoke exposure (59) . However, the effects were generally limited (OR 1.1-1.5), and the number of cases was low (a few hundred subjects per study). London & Romieu (59) concluded that no definitive associations can be inferred from these studies. As the number of studied individuals grows, such interactions may become more evident. More importantly, perhaps, improved analytical methodology will help recognize gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. For example, current genome-wide association study (GWAS) chips were estimated to cover only 60% of the genome (42) . Additionally, better statistical and computational methods may identify genetic networks that lead to the development of asthma and thus uncover epistatic effects that are undetected in single-gene analyses, which are standard in published reports (93) .",

Although prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust particles and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are associated with increased risk of asthma, maternal ingestion of fruits, vegetables, and oily fish appears to be protective (16, 34) . Gestational exposure to an environment rich in microbial compounds protects against the development of atopy and appears to downregulate expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) (28) . For ETS, the risk of developing asthma is further increased by 17q21 genetic variants (16) . These associations suggest that fetal development and possibly preconception represent periods of vulnerability that affect T cell development and maturation, possibly via epigenetic marks (68) . This possibility is supported by effects of maternal nutritional stress, tobacco smoke, endocrine disruptors (bisphenol A and diethstilbestrol), and diesel fumes on epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and chromatin modifications (25, 65) . Interestingly, Li et al. (57) reported transgenerational association of a grandmother's smoking with her grandchildren's risk for asthma.

This epigenetically controlled phenotype could be reversed with demethylating agents, consistent with epigenetic plasticity. Thus, in a mouse model, in utero dietary factors can modify the heritable risk of allergic airway disease during a vulnerable period of fetal development through epigenetic regulation that may, in fact, be reversible. Our results suggest that the period of in utero vulnerability or the postnatal reversibility of these methylation marks may provide opportunities for intervention. Our findings are supported by a recently published study examining a birth cohort of 32,077 children in whom perinatal folic acid supplements were associated with an increased risk of wheezing at 18 months of age (41) . Other environmental exposures resulting in epigenetic marks may contribute to the development of asthma, including tobacco smoke, another in utero exposure associated with childhood asthma that can modify gene expression through DNA hypermethylation (57).",

As in most environmentally induced diseases, there is likely a dose-response continuum that dictates the genetic or environmental contribution to the development of the phenotype. In the extremes, certain genetic characteristics, such as alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, or extreme environmental exposure to pollution may be sufficient to induce COPD independent of other factors. In the overwhelming majority of cases, however, genetic susceptibility supplements a correspondingly appropriate degree of environmental exposure to induce COPD. Even in patients with extreme AAT deficiency, cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for severe COPD (23) . In fact, COPD is a disease in which environmental exposures may dominate the disease presentation. For example, in the Lung Health Study, sustained smoking cessation was the most significant determinant of lung function over a period of 14 years (3), suggesting that individual host factors may be less important. However, evidence of genetic susceptibility to COPD does exist. For example, some studies have shown an association of SNPs in the inflammatory genes TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2; the antioxidant genes GSTM1, GSTP1, and HMOX-1; and the xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme gene EPHX1 with COPD severity and the rate of lung function decline in smokers with COPD, although many of these findings could not be replicated (21) .",

Because smoking cessation is the single most powerful intervention affecting the rate of lung function decline in COPD, it is important to identify individuals who may more readily respond to cessation counseling as compared with those who would require more intensive treatment and follow-up. Indeed, polymorphisms in nicotine-metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes (mainly CYP2A6), in nicotine receptors, and in genes of the dopamine and serotonin pathways (involved in nicotine reward effects in the brain) may be associated with smoking addiction and the likelihood to stop smoking (75) .

The decreased HDAC2 activity may be attributable to increased oxidative stress in COPD lungs caused by smoking or pollutant exposure. This line of research elegantly demonstrates the epigenetic pathways through which environmental exposures may modify the host response to injury by influencing gene expression.

Considerable variability exists in the development of pulmonary fibrosis among workers exposed to similar concentrations of fibrogenic dusts or organic antigens. ILD has been observed in individuals with genetic disorders, including Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, neurofibromatosis, Niemann-Pick disease (26) , and dyskeratosis congenita (5) . Furthermore, pulmonary fibrosis has been reported in closely related family members, including monozygotic twins raised in different environments, genetically related members of several families, and family members separated at an early age.

            "text": "Given the biology of infections, most identified susceptibility genes are part of either the innate immune or the adaptive immune system. Innate immunity is particularly important in the response to invading microorganisms. The innate immune system recognizes common and conserved microbial antigens, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), through pattern-recognition receptors such as TLRs. TLRs have relatively broad yet specific recognition patterns; for example, TLR2 recognizes lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycans on Gram-positive bacterial or fungal walls, and TLR4 recognizes the Gram-negative wall component endotoxin. After microbial antigens have been engaged by membrane-bound TLRs, cytoplasmic adaptor molecules such as myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) mediate downstream effects that result in cellular activation, cytokine release, and microbiocidal activity. Importantly, innate immune activation is now understood to modulate adaptive immunity as well, thus providing both the initial response to infection and the follow-up cues to further immune activity (71) . Innate immune gene polymorphisms are frequently found as susceptibility factors in respiratory infections. The hyporesponsive TLR4 polymorphisms Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, as well as CD14 SNPs leading to higher circulating levels of CD14, have been associated with increased mortality from sepsis (39, 62) . The same TLR4 SNPs were associated with increased susceptibility to severe RSV infection in high-risk (premature and congenital heart disease) infants (6); this study established a risk synergy between a genetic factor (TLR4 SNPs) and nongenetic comorbidity (prematurity), highlighting the complex endogenous and exogenous factors that define susceptibility to infections.",

TLR activation in macrophages leads to increased di-hydroxy-vitamin D production, which exhibits potent immuno-modulating actions (15) . Indeed, investigators have associated SNPs in the vitamin D receptor gene VDR with increased susceptibility to severe RSV (53) and TB (14, 94) infections. Some innate immune genetic polymorphisms have been associated with resistance to TB disease. TIRAP is an innate immune protein that transduces TLR2 and TLR4 stimuli. The S180L TIRAP polymorphism construct leads to reduced response to TLR2 and TLR4 activation in vitro when compared with wild-type TIRAP. This polymorphism was associated with a reduced OR for developing TB and systemic lupus erythematosus in case-control and family-based association studies (19, 54) .",

First, many of these diseases are phenotypic syndromes rather than distinct pathological entities. For example, asthma is defined by physiologic criteria and COPD by clinical and radiographic criteria. The diagnosis of these diseases surely encompasses several distinct pathophysiologic entities, which each contribute a minority/fraction of the total patient population. Second, these diseases likely result from complex traits; i.e., the simultaneous presence of multiple gene variants is necessary for the development of disease. These gene-gene interactions, called epistasis, may play a substantial role in the development of complex traits (93) . Third, several types of genetic variations, such as copy number variation, cis-acting (intragene) versus trans-acting (extragene) regulatory variants, and noncoding DNA effects, may simultaneously affect genetic susceptibility, although this is currently incompletely understood. Fourth, environmental exposures in themselves can alter the genetic profiles of subjects and their offspring via epigenetic and mutational mechanisms. Fifth, nongenetic factors, such as comorbidities, lifestyle choices, diet, and exercise, may confound the gene-environment interaction. Finally, environmental exposures are never uniform or isolated. Duration, timing, and coexposures may alter the burden on a susceptible individual and thus ultimately affect disease presentation and severity. All these factors make it evident that our approach to ecogenomics must be complex and integrated.",

We must expand the use of comparative genomics and utilize the study of gene-environment interactions in model organisms to focus our planning and design of human studies. Finally, new statistical, analytical, and computational tools will be needed to detect interactions among genes, epigenetics, and environmental exposures in their full complexity. Clearly this approach will require an integration of scientific disciplines: Collaboration among physicians, geneticists, engineers, epidemiologists, biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists will be necessary to establish the network needed for effective design, implementation, and interpretation of the studies that examine the combined environmental and genetic causes of complex lung diseases.",
