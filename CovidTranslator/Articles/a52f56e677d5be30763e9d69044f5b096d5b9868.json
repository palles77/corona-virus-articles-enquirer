The detergent extract contained the fusion protein (F) and the tetrameric and dimeric forms of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN). These proteins were purified by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate, by ion-exchange and metal chelate affinity HPLC in the presence of 0.1% decylpolyethyleneglycol, and by reversed-phase HPLC without prior removal of the detergent. The tetramer of HN and F could be purified by size-exclusion HPLC after dissociation of a micellar aggregate containing tetrameric HN and multimeric F. The F and HN proteins could be purified by ion-exchange HPLC. Pure F protein could be obtained after metal chelate affinity HPLC. The F protein and the dimer and tetramer of HN could be eluted from a large-pore (100 nm) reversed-phase column, but they were eluted as broad, overlapping peaks. Only after reduction of the virion extract, the relatively small (13-15 kilodaltons) F2 protein could be obtained in pure form.",

Many proteins are much more hydrophobic than the reference proteins and, as a consequence, show a tendency to aggregate. Because of this, they are often difficult to purify. The strategy for purifying such a protein strongly depends on its properties and its ultimate application. We have used Sendai virus proteins as model compounds for the development of HPLC methods for the purification of hydrophobic membrane proteins. Size-exclusion, ion-exchange and reversed-phase HPLC were used to purify these proteins1s2.",

The Sendai virus envelope is composed of a lipid bi- layer in which two integral membrane proteins are embedded, the hemagglutininneuraminidase (HN, M, = 68 000) and the fusion protein (F, M, = 65 000). These proteins are present as spikes on the outside of the virus particle, extending into the solvent. The HN protein is found in the monomeric, a dimeric and a tetrameric form, while the F protein consists of two components Fi (M, = 50000) and F2 (Mr = 13 000-15 000) which are connected by one disulfide bridge. Recently, the base sequences of the Sendai virus proteins were determined3+; the molecular weights based on the amino acid sequences, are 61495 and 63 408 for F and HN, respectively. However, these figures do not include carbohydrate groups and, therefore, we will use the earlier mentioned higher molecular weights, which are based on data from sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).",

This resulted in a number of broad peaks, all of which contained the F protein. It was concluded that micelles of different size were separated. In the presence of SDS, a similar phenomenon is observed when the protein sample is not boiled prior to chromatography. The F protein is eluted in multimeric forms from the size-exclusion column. Dialysis against water is sufficient to break up the large micelles, which, in addition to the F protein, contain the HN multimers. These effects were utilized to achieve the separation shown in Fig. 2B , which yielded a pure preparation of F protein and the tetramer of HN.",

Of the three amino acids, His, Trp, and Cys, His and Trp are often accessible, while Cys is only occasionally accessible. Cys is often located in the interior part of proteins as part of a disulfide bridge. The Sendai virus HN protein contains almost twice as much His and Trp as the F protein, which may explain why the HN protein was retained longer than the F protein. The proteins were eluted in more than one peak (See Fig. 3) . As mentioned before, mild chromatographic conditions may result in the Sendai virus proteins being contained in different micelles.",

            "text": "Recently, we found that a reversed-phase packing material with large pores (100 nm) was particularly suitable for the purification of a reduced Sendai virus extract2J6. The detergent extract contained the 13-15 kilodaltons F2 protein, the 50 kilodaltons Fr protein and the monomer of the HN protein (68 kilodaltons). When the extract was not reduced, it contained proteins with much higher molecular weights (up to 272 kilodaltons). In the present study, the unreduced extract was chromatographed on the RPLC column. The results (Fig. 4) show that the large proteins could be eluted but no separation between the tetramer and the dimer of HN and the F protein was obtained. The broad peaks may be caused by repeated precipitation and dissolution of these large membrane proteins. In view ofthese results, the strategy for the purification of a particular membrane protein will primarily depend on its ultimate use. When the structural integrity of the protein is of less importance, ix, in amino acid sequence studies, all modes of HPLC can be used, either alone or in combination. When the structure of the protein must remain intact for further studies, buffer systems of physiological pH, in which a mild detergent is included, are recommended. Secondary factors which may play a role, especially in reversed-phase HPLC of membrane proteins, are the overall hydrophobicity and the size of the protein. Membrane proteins are generally more hydrophobic than an average protein (see Table I ). An average membrane protein contains 30% large hydrophobic amino acids and the average percentage of such amino acids in 314 families of proteinsz9 is 20.2%. As a consequence, a membrane protein will have more sites available for interaction with hydrophobic column ligands, and relatively high concentrations of organic solvent will be needed for elution. A similar effect is caused by the size of the protein. A larger protein will have more interaction sites with a column matrix than a small protein. This is reflected in the results obtained with reversed-phase HPLC of Sendai virus proteins. The smallest protein, Fz (13-15 kilodaltons), can be purified and is recovered quantitatively, whereas the other proteins, F1, HN, F, and the dimer and tetramer of HN, can only be purified partially2 or not at all by reversed-phase HPLC.",
