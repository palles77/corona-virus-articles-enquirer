The success of these non-pharmaceutical strategies will depend not only on the effectiveness of quarantine or other isolation measures but also on the epidemiological characteristics of the infection. However, there is currently no systematic framework to assess the relationship between different containment strategies and the natural history and epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Here, we compare the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, implemented via contact tracing, in controlling epidemics using an agent-based branching model. We examine the relationship between epidemic containment and the disease dynamics of symptoms and infectiousness for seven case study diseases with diverse natural histories including Ebola, Influenza A, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). We show that the comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring and quarantine depends critically on the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. The benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is generally maximized for fast-course diseases, but we show the conditions under which symptom monitoring alone can control certain outbreaks. This quantitative framework can guide policy-makers on how best to use non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain emerging outbreaks and prioritize research during an outbreak of a novel pathogen.",

Among the various containment strategies, isolation of ill and potentially infectious patients is one of the most intuitive, relying on the tracing the contacts of known cases. Contacts with symptoms can then be hospitalized or isolated, but policy makers must also decide how best to handle contacts that do not meet the case definition for infection. Two strategies have historically been used in the case of a potentially infected but symptom-free contact: quarantine and symptom monitoring.",

A less conservative but substantially cheaper and more socially palatable approach is active symptom monitoring of contacts. In this strategy, health workers check on contacts one or two times a day and isolate them if symptoms occur (see definitions in Methods).",

Subsequent work has explored the interaction between disease characteristics (e.g., super-spreading (18) ) and the performance of interventions (e.g., travel screening (19) ), but the recent Ebola epidemic demonstrated that at least two large questions remain (7) . Firstly, what is the role of symptom monitoring as an alternative to quarantine, and secondly, how does this choice depend on the characteristics of the disease, the setting, and their interactions?",

Analogous to the approach of (2), our method of direct observation of simulated serial intervals is restricted to the exponential growth period of an epidemic, as produced by a branching model. However, the potential for the length of generation intervals to be under-estimated near the peak of an epidemic can cause a downward bias in the published serial intervals upon which our parameterization methods are based (2, 3) . Therefore, this downward bias can result in a bias towards \"faster\" disease parameters (namely, a leftward bias in !\"\"#$% , !\"# , and ! ). Such a bias would reduce the simulated effectiveness of all interventions considered in this paper. for influenza A and hepatitis A and by <10% for pertussis. However, due to a much shorter incubation period of influenza A versus hepatitis A ( Table 2) , the relative costeffectiveness measured by the reduction per day of quarantine (outlined bars) is substantially higher for influenza A than hepatitis A.

We assume time-varying relative infectiousness follows a triangular distribution with time of peak infectiousness ( ! ) occurring anywhere between the onset and end of infectiousness, inclusively. We record both the day of transmission and the source of each new infection for each transmission event, and draw disease characteristics for each newly infected individual. An individual is identified by contact tracing with probability PCT at the earlier time of either when their infector is isolated or the time of the transmission event if infection occurs while the infector was isolated. After an operational lag time of DCT days, a contact is placed under quarantine, symptom monitoring or, if already symptomatic,isolation. An individual in isolation or quarantine has their infectiousness reduced by a factor \u03b3 for the remainder of their disease. An individual under symptom monitoring is isolated DSM days after symptom onset. A full description of the model process can be found in S1 Appendix.",
