            "text": "Rapid detection of infectious disease outbreaks is often crucial for their effective control. One example is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI ) such as H5N1 in commercial poultry flocks. There are no quantitative data, however, on how quickly the effects of HPAI infection in poultry flocks can be detected. Here, we study, using an individual-based mathematical model, time to detection in chicken flocks. Detection is triggered when mortality, food or water intake or egg production in layers pass recommended thresholds suggested from the experience of past HPAI outbreaks. We suggest a new threshold for caged flocks-the cage mortality detection threshold-as a more sensitive threshold than current ones. Time to detection is shown to depend nonlinearly on R 0 and is particularly sensitive for R 0 !10. It also depends logarithmically on flock size and number of birds per cage. We also examine how many false alarms occur in uninfected flocks when we vary detection thresholds owing to background mortality. The false alarm rate is shown to be sensitive to detection thresholds, dependent on flock size and background mortality and independent of the length of the production cycle. We suggest that current detection thresholds appear sufficient to rapidly detect the effects of a high R 0 HPAI strain such as H7N7 over a wide range of flock sizes. Time to detection of the effects of a low R 0 HPAI strain such as H5N1 can be significantly improved, particularly for large flocks, by lowering detection thresholds, and this can be accomplished without causing excessive false alarms in uninfected flocks. The results are discussed in terms of optimizing the design of disease surveillance programmes in general.",

With the increasing emergence of new infectious diseases into often large naive populations, the rapid detection and characterization of these diseases is crucial in preventing potentially catastrophic epidemics. Four examples where the lack of early detection has caused socially and economically disastrous epidemics are foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 (Anderson 2002; Haydon et al. 2003) , SARS in East Asia in 2003 (Ho & Su 2004) , highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI ) H7N1 in Italy in 1999 (Capua & Marangon 2000) and HPAI H7N7 in The Netherlands in 2003 (Elbers et al. 2004a) . In particular to HPAI, the escalating number of epidemics of HPAI viruses in domestic poultry around the world, the endemicity of H5N1 virus in poultry in southern China (Li et al. 2004) and its potential mutation into a human transmissible form have heightened the awareness of rapid detection of infection in poultry and humans ( Ferguson et al. 2004 ; Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Organisation for Animal Health 2005; Kuiken et al. 2005; Capua & Alexander 2006) .",

It is important to know this for several reasons. First, in an epidemic situation, it is vitally important to trace contacts between farms on which infection has been notified and farms that are at risk of infection. Fast and efficient tracing of contacts is essential in the combat of such diseases. Knowing the temporal window during which a farm is infectious focuses limited resources on tracing farms at risk. Second, national planning for disease control requires a good understanding of disease dynamics on farms in order to inform models of the transmission dynamics between farms. Some key parameters for such models are time to detection and farm latent and infectious periods, all of which can be inferred from well-parametrized mathematical models.",

If death is sudden with little or no clinical signs, then rapidly rising mortality may be the first indication that something is amiss. If clinical signs are more apparent, then decreased food and water intake or reduced egg production in layers may be the first indication. Deciding whether something is wrong with a flock is made difficult by the day-to-day variation in bird deaths, food and water usage and egg production. Even in healthy commercial poultry flocks, a small number of deaths are expected. Typical daily mortalities are approximately 0.01-0.15% (McMullin 2006; Elbers et al. 2007) .",

Therefore, if the production cycle lasts C days, then mortality is calculated CK6 times during the production cycle. The expected number of false alarms during the production cycle, f w , is therefore \u00f0C K6\u00deP\u00f0a w ; T Z 7; b; N \u00de Z f w :",

Bird susceptibility, s, is set to 1 with no loss of generality if we assume susceptibility to infection via the faecal-oral and respiratory routes is the same. Our simulations assume frequency-dependent transmission. Density-dependent transmission would lead to R decreasing as birds die during the outbreak because birds would experience fewer contacts. However, because very few birds die before detection, the change Avian influenza surveillance N. J. Savill et al. 1411 in R would be negligible. Hence, our results would not be affected if we had chosen density-dependent transmission instead. Once bird i becomes infected, it is latent (asymptomatic and non-infectious) for L i hours. It then becomes asymptomatic and infectious for A i hours. We assume that the infectiousness of birds is constant throughout the infectious period. At the end of the asymptomatic period, birds have a probability p S of becoming symptomatic, otherwise they die. Symptomatic bird i is infectious for S i hours and then dies. We assume that dead birds are not infectious. We consider two cases of HPAI for which we have some data: H5N1 and H7N7. H5N1 is characterized by rapid death within 2-4 days with few apparent clinical signs before death and virus excretion 1 day after infection (Shortridge et al. 1998; Tsukamoto et al. 2007 ). With very little other data to proceed on, we assume that a bird's latent period in hours is randomly drawn from the distribution 24C Binomial(24, 0.5) that gives a minimum latent period of 24 hours, a maximum of 48 hours and a mean of 36 hours (table 1) . A bird's asymptomatic period in hours is drawn from the distribution 24CBinomial(18, 0.5). Birds have a 50% chance of showing clinical signsreduced food or water intake or egg production in layers-and if they do, they die after 6 hours. A more detailed quantitative analysis of the H7N7 virus from the Dutch 2003 epidemic has established that the latent period in chickens is approximately 1-2 days (modelled as 24CBinomial(48, 0.5)) and the infectious period is 6.3 days with a 95% CI from 3.9 to 8.7 days (modelled as 94CBinomial(115, 0.5); van der Goot et al. 2005) . Elbers et al. (2007) noted that infected farms in the Dutch 2003 epidemic experienced some reduced food and water intake the day before mortality began to rise. We therefore allow all birds to become symptomatic with the symptomatic period distributed as Binomial(24, 0.5).",

            "text": "We first examine the relationship between false alarm rate and the daily detection threshold in uninfected flocks. Figure 1a shows the expected number of false alarms per production cycle as the daily mortality detection threshold is varied for different background mortality rates and a flock size of 10 000 birds (equation (2.2)). The most striking result is the sensitivity of false alarm rate to the detection threshold. Taking a background mortality of 0.05% as an example (red dashed line), for detection thresholds up to 0.093%, a flock is expected to have at least one false alarm during its production cycle. To achieve, say, a 1000-fold reduction in false alarm rate to 0.1% only requires the threshold to rise to 0.13%. This graph demonstrates that setting a detection threshold high enough makes the chance of a false alarm negligible; setting it slightly too low and false alarms become very frequent. The current recommended threshold of 0.5% means that false alarms will never happen for typical background mortality and for a flock of 10 000 birds. Note that these and the following results are independent of the characteristics of any AI subtype because we are examining uninfected flocks. For illustrative purposes, we fix the false alarm rate at 1 per 1000 production cycles, and examine how the threshold varies with flock size (figure 1b), length of production cycle (figure 1c) and background mortality rate (figure 1d ). Figure 1b shows the daily mortality detection threshold such that the false alarm rate is 1 per 1000 production cycles for varying flock size and background mortality rates. As flock size increases and background mortality decreases, the minimum threshold drops. For a given flock size and background death rate, a threshold above the curve will give less than one false alarm per 1000 production cycles and a threshold below the curve will give more than one false alarm per 1000 production cycles. Thus, the currently recommended threshold of 0.5% would cause more than one false alarm per 1000 production cycles for flocks with less than approximately 1000 birds and typical background mortalities of 0.05%. The discontinuities in the curves are not artefacts or numerical errors; they are due to the detection threshold a d , which is a continuous parameter, being transformed into a discrete number of birds, i.e. a d N. Figure 1c shows that daily mortality detection thresholds (for one false alarm per 1000 production cycles and a flock size of 10 000 birds) is insensitive to the length of the production cycle. This is because the number of false alarms during a production cycle is linearly related to the length of the production cycle, and a linear change in false alarm rate (at approx. 1 per 1000 production cycles) can be accomplished with very small changes to the detection threshold (figure 1a). Figure 1d shows the sensitivity of the daily mortality detection threshold against background mortality for a false alarm rate of 1 per 1000 production cycles and varying flock sizes. For small background death rates (typical of commercial poultry flocks), the detection threshold for a given false alarm rate rises approximately linearly with the background death rate.",

Figure 4a shows how time to detection varies with daily mortality detection threshold for different flock sizes (1000-100 000 birds) and a background mortality rate of 0.05% in H5N1-infected flocks. For a given threshold, time to detection rises logarithmically with flock size. This is owing to the longer time it takes for a certain proportion of the birds to die given the same initial infection of a small amount of infective faeces as flock size increases. At the current recommended threshold (shown by the vertical dotted line), flocks of 1000 birds are detected around day 5 post-infection, whereas flocks of 100 000 birds are detected around day 25 post-infection. The black dashed lines demarcate regions of different false alarm rates in uninfected flocks (calculated using equation (2.2)).

This is not surprising given that the recommended symptoms threshold is 10 times less sensitive than the daily threshold. Presumably this threshold was set so high owing to the greater daily variation in food and water intake and egg production, compared with daily variation in mortality. Figure 5a shows the time to detection of H5N1 in caged birds versus the cage mortality detection threshold. For five birds per cage, time to detection is approximately 4 days and is almost independent of the cage mortality detection threshold. However, for 80 birds per cage, time to detection rises from 4 days for a less than 10% mortality threshold to 60 days at an 80% mortality threshold. Moreover, time to detection can be significantly improved without compromising on false alarms; for all the numbers of birds per cage, time to detection can be reduced to approximately 4 days while still maintaining a false alarm rate of less than 10 K6 per production cycle.",

We show that the false alarm rate is sensitive to the various detection thresholds. The implication is that it is better to set a detection threshold slightly too high rather than too low. We show that for a given false alarm rate (e.g. 1 per 1000 production cycles), detection thresholds vary in a nonlinear fashion with flock size and number of birds per cage and background mortality rate, but are insensitive to the length of the production cycle.",

We therefore recommend an additional mortality detection threshold for caged systems. The reason a cage mortality detection threshold is more sensitive than other thresholds is that deaths are spatially clustered in a small subgroup of the flock and are therefore easier to observe. A value of approximately 50% dead birds in a single cage should be easily detected in commercial caged flocks and prevents excessive false alarms in uninfected flocks (figure 2). Time to detection is generally faster than in floor-reared flocks because most early deaths occur in small easily monitored cages rather than a large open area containing thousands of birds. As for floor-reared birds, time to detection can be improved by lowering the detection threshold without compromising on false alarms. For H7N7, we predict an improvement of only a few days when there are more than approximately 20 birds per cage and there is little improvement at lower densities. For H5N1, we predict that very little improvement can be made for less than approximately 20 birds per cage; however, several weeks can be taken off time to detection for higher densities.",

J. Savill et al. 1417 caged systems; thus, by lowering detection thresholds, we predict that time to detection can be improved by days or even weeks without compromising on false alarms in uninfected flocks. When R 0 is high, we predict that time to detection can be improved by only a day or two, and only then for large flock sizes or high numbers of birds per cage.",

The epidemiological investigation of the January outbreak found that a shed of 7119 turkeys became infected somewhere between 22 and 25 January. Some birds were 'off colour' on 27 January and mortality was 0.18, 2.2 and 12% on 30 January, 31 January and 1 February, respectively. Disease was notified on 1 February. Based on current recommended mortality thresholds, notification occurred on the appropriate day. Our model predicts that detection would have occurred approximately 11-12 days postinfection in chickens, or approximately during the week beginning 4 February: at least 3 days after actual detection. This discrepancy could be because turkeys are generally more susceptible to AI compared with chickens (Tumpey et al. 2004; Balicer et al. 2007) . Alternatively, multiple turkeys may have been initially infected as the route of infection was likely to have been contaminated wild birds or rodents entering the shed. Unfortunately, the epidemiological investigation of the November outbreak was unable to trace the source of infection. This meant there was no estimate of when the turkeys were initially infected.",

To calculate thresholds for a certain false alarm rate for a particular flock is not simple. However, pre-printed tables or graphs such as in figure 2 can be easily referred to in a commercial situation. Moreover, we have assumed a constant death rate of birds over a production cycle, which implies that the number of bird deaths is binomially distributed. In reality, chickens and layers have a peak in mortality in the first week post-hatch and thereafter layer mortality tends to be low throughout rear and production with a slight rise as the birds age. Chicken mortality tends to rise again more rapidly towards week 5 in the production cycle. However, it is feasible that detection thresholds can be adjusted throughout the production cycle to take these predictable variations into account.",

(2007) have noted that some farmers still ignore the early detection system put in place during the H7N7 epidemic in The Netherlands. Moreover, rising mortality can be caused by other avian diseases and stress conditions leading to a hesitation to notify. Notwithstanding this, the results we describe here have relevance in informing the implementation of an early detection system. It gives policy makers a quantitative and scientific base on which to make decisions on surveillance and control. It feeds into mathematical models of between-flock transmission that are used to inform contingency planning, and contact tracing in an epidemic can be refined based on our estimates of time to detection. Elbers et al. (2007) have highlighted the necessity for good quantification of mortality with respect to flock size as a means for rapid diagnosis of AI. We wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment, and would add that more and better quantification and reporting of all aspects of poultry rearing and key epidemiological parameters such as latent and infectious periods and transmission rates are paramount for developing evidence-based surveillance, control and prevention strategies. Figure 6 highlights and reiterates that imperfect prophylactic vaccination that reduces R 0 to just above 1 can have serious consequences for disease control (Savill et al. 2006) . Time to detection can be significantly increased compared with non-vaccinated birds with much higher R 0 . This suggests that disease could spread through flocks undetected for many weeks before mortality rises above the threshold. This makes between-flock transmission much more likely and control of an epidemic orders of magnitude more difficult. It may also increase the risk of transmission to humans.",
