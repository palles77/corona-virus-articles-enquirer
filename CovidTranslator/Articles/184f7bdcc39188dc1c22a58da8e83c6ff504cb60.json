His brother became Taiwan's first SARS fatality. A fellow passenger on the train also was affected. The number of cases began to increase steadily during the last weeks of April. On April 28, the Taiwanese government imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all incoming travelers from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau, and Toronto. As of May 5, 2003 , 116 cases of SARS had been diagnosed in Taiwan, and 8 patients had died. 5 By the time the cases occurred in Taiwan, reports had begun flooding into WHO from different parts of the world. On March 8, 14 staff members of the private French Hospital in Hanoi were ill with an acute respiratory syndrome, and a WHO team arrived to provide support. By March 11, at least 20 hospital personnel in the Hanoi hospital and 23 at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong were ill with an unidentified acute respiratory syndrome. 2, 9 On March 12, WHO issued a global alert concerning the spread of a severe atypical pneumonia with unknown etiol-ogy.

Because most data available were on adults, they decided to report on their experience in treating children at the Prince of Wales and Princess Margaret hospitals in Hong Kong.

All 10 children satisfied the WHO case definition for SARS, had been in close contact with infected adults, and had fever that lasted for a median duration of 6 1. The causative agent and the potential for spread were still unknown. 2. The outbreaks appeared to pose a great risk to health care workers, family members, and other close contacts of patients. 3. None of the different antibiotics and antivirals that had been tried empirically seemed to have an effect. 4. Although the numbers still were relatively small, the clinical course had progressed rapidly to respiratory failure, requiring intensive care, and many previously healthy patients had died. 5.

The land initiative involved sending teams of experts and specialized protective equipment for infection control to countries requesting such assistance.

Drosten and colleagues 12 reported that they had isolated \"a novel coronavirus\" in cell culture and had obtained a sequence 300 nucleotides in length using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based random amplification. On the basis of the obtained sequence, they established conventional and real-time PCR assays for specific and sensitive detection of the novel virus; the assays detected a variety of clinical specimens from patients with SARS but not from controls. High concentrations (up to 100 million molecules per milliliter) were found in sputum, and viral RNA also was detected at extremely low concentrations in plasma during the acute phase and in faces during the late convalescent phase.

They determined crystal structures for human coronavirus (strain 229E) M pro and for an inhibitor complex of porcine coronavirus [transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)] M pro and constructed a homology model for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) M pro . They noted that the structures reveal a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites, which is further supported by recombinant SARS-CoV M pro -mediated cleavage of a TGEV M pro substrate. Molecular modeling suggests that available rhinovirus 3C pro inhibitors may be modified to make them useful for treating SARS.",

Questions remain about the accuracy of case reports, especially because in many instances the data are poor and instances of underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are almost inevitable during an outbreak of a new disease. Other questions concern the evident heterogeneity in transmission, especially in light of the extreme instances of transmission in which single individuals apparently infected as many as 300 others. Yet another concern is whether global eradication of SARS can be established. 15 Table 4 . Concerns Identified by WHO as Result of SARS 1. Inadequate surge capacity in hospitals and public health systems 2. Healthcare providers themselves being the victims of the disease 3. Shortage of expert staff to coordinate national and global responses to a rapidly evolving public health emergency 4.
