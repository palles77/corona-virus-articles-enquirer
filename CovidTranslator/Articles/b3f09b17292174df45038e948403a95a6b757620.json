Cases can require hospitalization and require admission to the intensive care unit [2, 3] . The unpredictable, continuous and rapid mutational potential of influenza viruses poses a serious threat to global health security with a possibility of pandemics at any time [4] . The zoonotic strains of influenza such as influenza A(H5N1) first detected in humans in 1997 in Hong Kong and then reported widespread globally since 2003, A(H7N9) reported in humans since 2013 in China and A(H9N2) reported for decades to be circulating in poultry and recently reported in humans, are strong evidence of these mutational capabilities; [5] [6] [7] [8] . Therefore influenza surveillance is essential to monitor and rapidly detect the circulation of different influenza viruses and the emergence of genetic changes in these viruses in humans and animals [9] . Information from influenza surveillance is also important in order to identify circulating strains to be included in the biannual vaccine strain selection to ascertain the needs for each region globally [10] . Nevertheless, surveillance systems have limitations such as lack of consensus on case definition, non-systematic sampling methods, scarcity of information on the circulating influenza viruses, and inconsistent and delayed reporting of cases [11] .",

Implementation of PIP Framework activities started in the Region in 2014 [13] . Currently, seven countries of the Region-Afghanistan, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Sudan and Yemen-benefit from the Partnership Contribution (PIP-PC) to enhance their capacities in the areas of influenza laboratories and surveillance. Also, the establishment of the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infections Network in 2007 has played a crucial role in intensifying the influenza surveillance and response programme in the Region [14] .",

            "text": "Our study had some limitations. Up to June 2018, 16 out of the 22 countries of the Region had started reporting their SARI data to the EMFLU Network. After excluding data from one reporting country, the data analysed covered only 15 countries and did not include data from seven countries of the Region. In addition, no data were available from one of the four influenza transmission zones in the Region, the Eastern Africa transmission zone; thus, our findings are not fully representative of all influenza zones in the Region. Finally, some of the sentinel sites in the Region included in our study were not strictly following the same ideal criteria for choosing SARI sentinel sites, for example, some sites were pediatric hospitals, and this may explain the high number of enrolled SARI cases reported to EMFLU Network within the age group less than 2-year-old. Therefore, the age group and other demographic analyses should be interpreted with caution due to possible biases.",

            "text": "The current study shows that influenza viruses cause a notable number of severe respiratory infections throughout the year in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, although the strains of the virus vary from one country to another and over time. Influenza peaks in the Region are observed during winter months, consistent with results from other studies in northern hemisphere countries. Calculating the burden caused by influenza viruses in the Region requires further studies to be conducted. It is important for countries of the Region to continue their efforts to enhance their influenza surveillance capacities in order to be able to rapidly detect any unusual influenza activity or new strain that may cause a pandemic.",
