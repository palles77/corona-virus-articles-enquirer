In this study, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus that simultaneously expressed the genes for the P12A and 3C proteins of Asia I FMDV from individual promoters. The capsid proteins expressed in High Five TM insect cells were processed by viral 3C protease, as shown by Western blotting, and were antigenic, as revealed by their reactivity in an indirect sandwich-ELISA, and by immunofluorescent assay. The empty capsid-like particles were similar to authentic 75S empty capsids from FMDV in terms of their shape, size and sedimentation velocity, as demonstrated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Both empty capsid-like particles and some small-sized particles (about 10 nm in diameter) were also observed using immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, the empty capsid-like particles or intermediates induced high levels of FMDV-specific antibodies in guinea pigs following immunization, and neutralizing antibodies were induced in the second week after vaccination. These recombinant, non-infectious, FMDV empty capsids are potentially useful for the development of new diagnostic techniques and vaccines.",

Myristoylation at the Nterminus of P12A is essential for efficient capsid assembly Krausslich et al., 1990) , and the P1 sequence, as well as the 2A and 3C proteases are necessary for processing of the P1 polyprotein into VP1, VP3 and VP0.

All of these results demonstrated that empty capsids of FMDV were similar to virions, and could be used to mimic virions immunologically. Several different expression systems have been used to produce empty capsid-like particles of FMDV (Lewis et al., 1991; Abrams et al., 1995; Mayr et al., 1999) , however, many problems still exist such as poor immunogenic capability or low efficiency. Adenovirus based vaccine known for its best protective effects can protect 5 of 5 vaccinated cattle, but this vaccine is still unacceptable because of the limit for repeated vaccination and high cost. The baculovirus expression system has many advantages over other expression systems, and has been used to produce large quantities of viral proteins (Luckow and Summers, 1989; Webb and Summers, 1990) . Although there have been many attempts to complete the assembly of FMDV empty capsid-like particles in the baculovirus expression system, no FMDV empty capsid-like particles have been detected in insect cells by electron microscopy. As shown in the previous study by Jae-Ku et al. (2007) , only pentamer-like structures could be observed using electron microscopy. These authors presumed that the pH (about 6.2) of the insect cell medium influenced the assembly of the FMDV capsid structures. In our study, however, in addition to pentamer-like structures (small-sized particles under IEM), we also observed some empty capsid-like particles. This was consistent with the Fig. 8 . The antibody titers of guinea pigs after primary and booster inoculations analyzed by indirect ELISA. Sera were sampled at day 0 (prior to vaccination), day 14 and day 28 after the primary and booster vaccinations and tested for antibodies at 1:32 dilution. The result was obtained from the average of three sera in each group. dpv: days post vaccination. report of Ellard et al. (1999) , who reported that empty capsids were more resistant to low pH than corresponding virions, and that some survived at pH 6.2. We collected and processed the infected cells using a lysis buffer (pH 7.4) that might have facilitated the assembly of empty capsid-like particles. These results further suggest a pivotal role for pH in the stability of FMDV empty capsids. It is also possible that empty capsids of the Asia I virus strain that we used were more resistant to acid conditions than those of the O type virus. Curry et al. (1995) found that acid-resistance varied among different strains of FMDV within the same serotype.",

The viral proteins were expressed by a recombinant baculovirus in HF cells, and expressed recombinant proteins were processed by 3C protease and self-assembled into empty capsid-like particles or intermediates, as observed by IEM and the appearance of the VP0, VP3 and VP1 bands in Western blotting. Sucrose gradient analysis indicated that 75S empty capsids were present in the 25% sucrose gradient, and this was confirmed by electron microscopy. According to the results of IS-ELISA and IFA, the expressed empty capsid-like particles were antigenic.",

Both FMDV-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were generated in these guinea pigs, but their levels were lower than those generated by the commercial vaccine. One possible reason for this was that we vaccinated animals with crudely extracted proteins containing empty capsids, and the quantity of empty capsidlike particles might have been lower than in the conventional inactivated vaccine. Further studies are therefore needed to improve the amount of protein expression and empty capsid assembly in insect cells. Based on our results, we can conclude that empty capsid-like particles or intermediates of Asia I FMDV assembled in insect cells exhibit good antigenicity and immunogenicity. These initial laboratory results are encouraging for the development of an empty capsid subunit vaccine for FMD. However, the conventional inactivated FMDV vaccine currently remains the most effective means of controlling and preventing FMD in epidemic areas.",
