            "text": "Studies have shown that calves fed milk replacers (MR) with crude protein (CP) concentrations greater than 20%, as typically found in conventional MR, have higher dry matter intakes (DMI) and greater average daily gains (ADG) but consume less starter, which can lead to stress during weaning and reduced rumen development. The greater amount of CP being fed to preweaned calves may alter their nitrogen (N) balance, and excess N may be excreted in the urine. The objective of this study was to determine N utilization in preweaned calves fed diets varying in the amount of CP and MR fed. This study used 24 newborn dairy heifer calves blocked by birth and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) 446 g dry matter (DM) of a conventional MR (CON; 20% CP, 20% fat), (2) 669 g DM of a moderately high protein MR (moderate; MOD; 26% CP, 18% fat), or (3) 892 g DM of a moderately high protein MR (aggressive; AGG; 26% CP, 18% fat). All calves had ad libitum access to starter and water. Both MR and starter were medicated with decoquinate. During weaning (d 43-49), the morning MR feeding ceased. On d 50, all MR feedings ended; however, starter and water intakes were continuously recorded until d 56. At 5 wk of age, urine was collected using urinary catheters for 3 d and chromium oxide was administered by bolus at 2 g/d for 7 d to estimate N efficiency. Calves fed MOD and AGG had similar starter intakes, feed efficiencies, and ADG, with the combined treatments having reduced starter intakes (258 vs. 537 g/d), greater ADG (674 vs. 422 g/d), and improved feed efficiency (0.57 vs. 0.45 gain:feed) compared with CON calves preweaning. However, DMI and water intake were similar across all treatments. Results from the N utilization phase showed that MOD and AGG treatments had similar but lower N efficiency compared with CON calves (45.5 vs. 52.7%). This could be due to MOD-and AGG-fed calves having greater urine volume and thereby, greater combined urine N output compared with CON calves (17.6 vs. 12.1 g/d). In summary, feeding >0.66 kg (DM) from a 26% CP MR increased ADG and improved feed efficiency during the preweaning period but reduced starter intake and lowered N efficiency.",

            "text": "Conventional calf feeding programs have restricted the amount of milk and milk replacer (MR) fed during the preweaning period in an effort to encourage more solid feed intake, minimize the cost of feeding and labor, and reduce the potential for scours and other diseases (Kertz et al., 1979; Otterby and Linn, 1981; Davis and Drackley, 1998) . The standard recommendations have been to feed whole milk at 8 to 10% of calf BW or 454 to 567 g of MR powder regardless of body size twice a day until weaning to provide enough energy to support minimal BW gains of 0.3 to 0.4 kg/d, depending upon starter intake, management, health, and environmental changes to meet requirements for maintenance under thermoneutral conditions (Davis and Drackley, 1998) . Greater starter intakes before weaning ensure that weight gains and intakes will be sustained after weaning (Kertz et al., 1979) . These recommendations are in contrast to numerous studies that have demonstrated calves fed greater intakes of milk solids as well as greater protein concentrations in MR have greater DMI, ADG, and overall skeletal measurements, (Appleby et al., 2001; Jasper and Weary, 2002) but calves consume less starter, which can lead to a more stressful time during weaning and less rumen development (Huber et al., 1984; Cowles et al., 2006; Hill et al., 2010; Guindon et al., 2015) , which places this type of program in direct opposition to the conventional calf management described above. Currently, an intensified optimum MR with CP levels greater than the 20% found in conventional MR is being fed to calves, which more closely resembles whole milk (Diaz et al., 2001) . Feeding a MR with >25% CP at an rate increasing with age up to 900 to 1,200 g of DM/d has allowed for greater BW gain than conventional MR programs (Diaz et al., 2001; Tikofsky et al., 2001; Blome et al., 2003; Bartlett et al., 2006) . These high feeding rates can capitalize on the rapid and efficient early lean growth potential of calves and allow for increased body protein deposition and growth rate (Kertz and Loften, 2013) .",

Chapman et al. (2016) showed that calves fed 0.87 kg of DM of a 27% CP, 17% fat MR preweaning had a reduction in postweaning OM digestibility of 11% and a reduction in NDF digestibility of 28% compared with control calves fed 0.44 kg of DM of a 21% CP, 21% fat MR. Terr\u00e9 et al. (2007a,b) also showed that digestibility of NDF was 40% less in calves fed greater levels of MR. Results from these studies show that large amounts of MR fed preweaning may further impair fiber digestion as the calf ages. Excessive feeding of CP to lactating cows and growing replacement heifers has been shown to increase fecal and urinary N, which can cause environmental problems (Wilkerson et al., 1997) . These high feeding rates of milk and MR may also have an effect on N utilization and preweaning nutrient digestion in the calf. The objective of this experiment was to determine N utilization, preweaning nutrient digestibility, and growth effects in calves fed diets varying in the amount of protein and the amount of MR fed. The hypothesis was that calves fed a conventional control MR will consume more starter throughout the preweaning period and be more N efficient compared with calves fed a moderately high protein MR.",

(2016) , that observed calves consuming up to 0.9 to 1.3 kg DM of MR daily during the preweaning period gained more weight, had greater skeletal growth, and were more efficient than calves fed approximately 0.5 kg DM of MR. As shown in Figure 1 , we found a significant treatment by week interaction for starter intake that resulted in an overall treatment effect. Overall, calves on the accelerated feeding programs consumed less starter than conventionally fed calves, which was attributed to the greater difference in starter intake during wk 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the preweaning period. In this study, calves fed AGG and MOD consumed only about 50% of starter that the CON-fed calves consumed during the preweaning period. Starter intake of AGG-and MOD-fed calves increased substantially during the weaning week (wk 7) when MR was reduced and during the postweaning week (wk 8) when MR was removed. This could be due to a highly nutrient dense MR fed at a high volume fulfilling most of the nutrient requirements of the calf, leaving little desire to eat starter. This can be correlated with lesser rumen development, as was seen in significant treatment by week interactions for BHB concentrations during the 56-d trial (Figure 2) . Studies have suggested that circulating BHB levels may be an indicator of rumen epithelial development and starter intake in preweaned calves (Quigley et al., 1991; Deelen et al., 2016) . Quigley et al. (1991) observed that total blood concentrations of VFA were greater in calves weaned early and that blood VFA responded rapidly to dry feed intake. Khan et al. (2011) concluded that increasing BHB concentrations in the blood as calves aged was mainly due to a shift in the sources of physiological fuel during the transition from liquid to solid diets. Control-fed calves had greater BHB concentrations throughout this study because they were consuming a significantly greater amount of starter in the preweaning period compared with the calves fed the moderately Means in the same row with different superscripts differ (P < 0.05). 1 Treatment CON = 446 g of a 20% CP, 20% fat MR; MOD = 669 g of a 26% CP, 18% fat MR; AGG = 892 g of a 26% CP, 18% fat MR. high protein MR (Figures 1 and 2) .

Their results showed that even though the conventionally fed heifers did not capitalize on early fast growth during the preweaning period, they were able to compensate in BW by d 63. Calves fed MOD and AGG on the current study did not maintain their weight advantage postweaning and this might be an example of compensatory growth occurring in the limit-MR-fed heifers (LaCasse et al., 1994) . We found no differences in ADG or feed efficiency among treatments in the weaning and postweaning weeks, which could have been due to the lower intake of starter of calves fed MOD and AGG in the preweaning period that likely reduced the growth and feed efficiency of those calves later in the study. Calves fed MOD and AGG had a rapid increase of starter intake during the weaning week (wk 7) and postweaning week (wk 8), which could be associated with those calves accumulating more digesta and filling of the gut that calves fed CON already had; thus, their BW gain was artificially high. Stamey et al. (2012) determined the effects of starter CP content on growth of Holstein calves from birth to 10 wk of age fed up to approximately 0.9 kg DM of MR daily compared with approximately 0.5 kg DM of MR daily. Those authors showed that calves fed the greater protein starter (25.5 vs. 19.6% CP on a DM basis) had less slump in ADG and BW after weaning than calves fed the conventional starter with the high protein MR.",

(2010) observed reduced DM and OM digestibility in the immediate 3 d postweaning with calves fed up to 1.1 kg DM of MR daily. In the current study, calves fed AGG and MOD had greater nutrient digestibility for percentage DM, starch, fat, and OM (P < 0.05) and tended to be greater for CP, ADF, and NDF (P < 0.10) compared with the CON-fed calves. This could be due to CON calves consuming 50% more starter, which is not as easy to digest. The quantities of nutrients digested per unit of BW were similar among all treatments except that AGG-fed calves had greater fat digested per unit of BW compared with MOD and CON. This was because the AGG calves had greater intake of fat per kilogram of BW during the preweaning period (P < 0.05). Hill et al. (2009) fed 0.66 kg DM of MR per calf daily that contained 14, 17, 20, or 23% fat and determined preweaning nutrient digestibility through chromium oxide. Results showed that preweaning apparent digestibility of DM, OM, fat, and NFC were linearly reduced as fat increased from 14 to 23%, which agrees with the current study.

This could be due to AGG and MOD calves having greater urine volume and thereby, greater combined urine N output compared with CON. Calves fed AGG and MOD did not utilize dietary N as efficiently as calves fed CON. Blome et al. (2003) determined N balance measurements during wk 3 and 4 of the experimental period and showed that retained N increased linearly (P < 0.001) as dietary CP increased. In that study, treatments were isocaloric MR (12.5% solids) fed at 12% of BW that contained 16.1, 18.5, 22.9, or 25.8% CP and no starter was offered. Calves in the current study had similar N retention values but AGG and MOD had lower N efficiency values. Estimates of N excretion from preweaned calves fed these high feeding rates of milk and MR are vital to evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of aggressive feeding programs (Wilkerson et al., 1997) .",

Blood glucose levels decreased throughout the 8 wk of the study regardless of treatment, which can be attributed to a physiological shift in the primary energy source from glucose to VFA when the rumen in young calves becomes functional (Hammon et al., 2002) . Blome et al. (2003) found that highest levels of plasma urea N were measured in calves fed the highest CP level, indicating that the calves on the 25.8% CP level did not utilize protein as efficiently as the calves on the other 3 treatments. The serum urea N concentrations in the current study increased over the duration of the study in all heifers; however, no differences were noted among treatments. It is possible that CON-fed calves had more endogenous protein breakdown than AGG-or MOD-fed calves and they were also consuming more starter, indicating greater digestion of starter by the rumen microbiota, resulting in an increase in ammonia concentrations in the rumen.",

The over-feeding of CP in MOD-and AGG-fed calves increased urinary N output, which can have economic and environmental impacts. Over the 56-d study, BW and hip height gain were greater for calves fed MOD and AGG compared with CON. Serum BHB concentrations were greater in CON compared with MOD and AGG calves throughout the study. Dairy producers could use serum BHB concentrations as an easy indicator of rumen development in their calves. Data from our study indicate that calves fed amounts of MR over approximately 669 g of DM of a higher-protein milk replacer will result in lower N efficiency and reduced rumen development.",
