            "text": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic is driving the re-emergence of tuberculosis (TB) as a global health threat, both by increasing the susceptibility of HIV-infected people to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and increasing the rate of emergence of drug-resistant Mtb. There are several other clinical challenges for treatment of co-infected patients including: expense, pill burden, toxicity, and malabsorption that further necessitate the search for new drugs that may be effective against both pathogens simultaneously. The anti-helminthic niclosamide has been shown to have activity against a laboratory strain of Mtb in liquid culture while bacteriostatic activity against non-replicating M. abscessus was also recently described. Here we extend these findings to further demonstrate that niclosamide inhibits mycobacterial growth in infected human macrophages and mediates potent bacteriostatic activity against the virulent Mtb Beijing strain. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that niclosamide inhibits HIV replication in human macrophages and Jurkat T cells through post-integration effects on pro-virus transcription. The dual antiviral and anti-mycobacterial activity was further observed in an in vitro model of HIV and Mtb co-infection using human primary monocyte-derived macrophages. These results support further investigation of niclosamide and derivatives as anti-retroviral/antimycobacterial agents that may reduce clinical challenges associated with multi-drug regimens and drug resistance.",

According to the 2018 WHO Global Tuberculosis Report, there were 10.4 million new TB infections in 2017, and approximately 1.7 million TB related deaths. TB is now the leading cause of infectious disease related death world-wide, as well as the leading cause of death in people living with HIV (PLWH) [1] . HIV infection increases susceptibility to new infection, or re-infection, with Mtb and increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reactivation [2] . Greater than 10% of new TB infections globally occur in PLWH, and in many sub-saharan African countries, over 50% of new or recurring TB cases are observed in PLWH [1] .",

            "text": "Further exacerbating the problem is the emergence of drug resistance in Mtb. Nearly half a million people have been identified as having a multi-(MDR) or extremely drug resistant (XDR) strain of Mtb [1] . Compounding the problem, the incidence of drug resistant Mtb is higher in PLWH than those without HIV [3] , and the chance of TBrelated mortality is greater [4] . Additionally, simultaneous treatment of TB and HIV has proven to be difficult, as many front-line HIV drugs perform poorly when used in combination with frontline TB drugs, particularly rifampicin [5] . HIV, like Mtb, is also experiencing emerging resistance to anti-retrovirals. The high mutation rate associated with retroviral reverse transcriptase results in a rapid development of drug resistant viral species that are only partially overcome with combination therapy [6, 7] . This combination of factors necessitates a constant search for new therapeutics that can treat one or both pathogens without significant side effects, interactions or toxicity. It also obviates https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tube.2019.04.008 Accepted 4 December 2018 the opportunity to revisit some non-first line drugs to which resistance has not yet emerged, and from which more effective, and perhaps even dual-active, derivatives may be synthesized. Niclosamide is an anti-helminthic drug introduced in the 1950's, and has been used to treat parasitic infections in millions of patients worldwide [8] . It has been shown to effect a number of host cellular signaling pathways, including Wnt [9] , Notch [10] , mTOR, NF-\u03baB [11] , and STAT3 [12] . This broad activity has led to its evaluation as a therapeutic agent for a number of cancers, including breast, colon, ovarian, prostate, and others [13] [14] [15] [16] . It has also shown potential to treat bacterial and viral infections such as Bacillus anthracis [17] , Pseudomonas aeruginosa [18] and Staphylococcus aureus [19] , as well as SARS-CoV [20] , Influenza [21] , Chikungunya [22] and Zika [23] viruses. In addition to the above, niclosamide has been investigated as a potential anti-mycobacterial drug. Sun et al. showed that niclosamide could inhibit the growth of the Mtb laboratory strain H37Rv at low micromolar concentrations in liquid culture [24] , and Berube et al. recently demonstrated activity against M. abscessus [25] in a non-replicating model.",

Given niclosamide's known mechanisms of action, suppressing host signaling pathways that led to HIV replication, we hypothesized that it might interrupt HIV replication during the postintegration phase of the viral life cycle. To test this hypothesis, we activated U1 cells, a human macrophage cell line with HIV-1 integrated into its genome, in the presence of increasing concentrations of niclosamide up to 1.25 \u03bcM, or media alone. Cells were then harvested, stained with a near-red live/dead marker and anti-HIVp24-FITC mAb and evaluated by flow cytometry (Fig. 2a) . The percent cells positive for HIV p24 was observed to decrease in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2b) . These effects were seen in the absence of measurable toxicity at the concentrations examined (Fig. 2c) . This, to our knowledge, is the first demonstration of the capacity of niclosamide to act as an antiretroviral agent and opens the door to investigation of niclosamide or its derivatives as potential dual-activity drugs in patients co-infected with HIV and Mtb or other complex infections. These are important observations, as Mtb infection is known to activate NF-\u03baB, a pathway with a well-defined role in the initiation of HIV replication in infected cells. While niclosamide is directly bacteriostatic, its host-directed effects indirectly oppose HIV replication.",

The HIV transcript encoding gag and pol is transcribed and translated as a single polypeptide, thus the presence or absence of p24 is a good indicator of the status of de novo synthesis of HIV proteins. As can be seen in Fig. 3a , U1 cells activated in the presence of 5 \u03bcM niclosamide were nearly absent p24. To determine if this was a result of silencing HIV transcription or a disruption of post-transcriptional processing, we assayed cells activated under the same conditions for the presence of HIV transcripts by semi-quantitative RT-PCR for HIV long terminal repeats (LTR). The fold change of HIV transcripts detected by RT-PCR in U1 cells activated in the presence of niclosamide was significantly lower than those activated in media alone, and nearly to the level of non-activated cells (Fig. 3b) . These finding indicate that niclosamide likely acts as a partial inhibitor of transcription for integrated HIV proviral genomes. This is important as, to date, antiretroviral drugs disrupt every other stage of the viral life cycle (entry, reverse transcription, integration and particle maturation), but proviral transcription has yet to be targeted therapeutically. It is also possible that niclosamide acts in other ways to affect the level of pro-viral transcripts, such as nuclear entrapment or increased degradation of viral RNAs. While additional studies will be needed to differentiate between these possible mechanisms, further exploration of niclosamide or its derivatives may potentially lead to a new class of anti-retroviral drugs in general as well as new approaches to complement TB chemotherapy.",

As discerned for U1 cells in 3.2, niclosamide decreases the percent of HIV + J-Lat cells in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 4) . Greater cell death was observed in the absence as well as increasing concentrations of drugs was seen in J-Lats vs. U1 cells (Fig. 4A) .
