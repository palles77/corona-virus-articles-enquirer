The BCV-L9 and the wild-type strain BCV-LY-138 agglutinated chicken and mouse erythrocytes. The acetylesterase facilitated break-down of the BCV-erythrocyte complex with chicken but only to a minimal extent with mouse erythrocytes in the receptor-destroying enzyme test. Purified preparations of the vaccine and the wild-type strains agglutinated chicken erythrocytes at low titers and mouse erythrocytes at 128 to 256 times higher titers whereas receptor destroying enzyme activity was detectable only with chicken erythrocytes. When wild-type strains were propagated in HRT cells at low passage levels, they produced 5 x 105 to 4.5 x 106 plaque forming units per 50 gl which agglutinated erythrocytes from mice but not from chickens. Diisopropylfluoro-phosphate moderately increased the hemagglutination titers, but completely inhibited the receptor destroying enzyme of purified virus of all strains. It had virtually no infuence on the plaque-forming infectivity of the different BCV strains. The acetylesterase of strain BCV-L9 reacting in the receptor-destroying enzyme test was stable for 3 h at 37 and 42 \"C. It was inactivated within 30 min at 56 \u00b0C while the hemagglutinin function of this strain was stable for 3 h at 37, 42, and 56 \u00b0C, but it was inactivated at 65 \u00b0C within lh.",

            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCV) has a hemagglutinin (HA) for some erythrocytes with an approximate molecular mass of 62 kDa and 124 kDa in the reduced and the nonreduced forms. This structural protein composes the short spikes of the viral envelope [4, 9, 1 I] . Acetylesterase activity (AE) was found associated with this glycoprotein of a BCV strain isolated from calves in the Netherlands and of the strain BCV-L9 [15, 16, 28] . This glycoprotein is now referred to as the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) of BCV [2] . The AE inactivates the receptors for BCV of susceptible cells by hydrolyzing an ester bond to liberate acetate from C-9 of sialic acid [15, 16, , an enzyme function first detected in the influenza C virus by Herrler and coworkers [5,1. The gene of the HE glycoprotein of BCV is located upstream of the S gene and predicts a protein with 424 amino acids [7, 12, 33,1. As an enteropathogen BCV causes severe diarrhea in neonatal calves, and it is also considered to be etiologically involved with winter dysentery of adult cattle [4, 11, 14] . BCV represents one of the better characterized coronaviruses with HA properties. Four major structural proteins are associated with infectious BCV. The HE as well as the spike or S glycoprotein (190kDa) and the integral membrane glycoprotein M (23) (24) (25) (26) are associated with the viral envelope while the phosphorylated N protein (50-54kDa) functions as a nucleocapsid [3, 8, 20, 23] . Proteolytic cleavage of the S glycoprotein precursor into S 1 and S 2 of 100 and 110 kDa is required for cell fusion activity [20, 22,1. The S 1/$2 glycoproteins facilitate virus attachment to susceptible cells, and also binding to erythrocytes, cell fusion, and induction of neutralizing antibodies [t7, 20, 22, 24, 25,1. The exact functions of HE and S 1/$2 and their interplay in the infectious process in vitro and in vivo are not fully defined [17, 24] .",

These strains are: BCV-LY-138, BCV-C-50, BCV-Miller, BCV-Meeker, and BCV-Fisher. The vaccine strain of BCV was cultured in HRT-18 cells from the vaccine of Norden Laboratories, Omaha, Nebraska [11, 18] . Importantly, cultivation of the BCV wild-type strains remained impossible for us until it was demonstrated that the cytopathic expression of BCV-L9 in cultured bovine cells was enhanced by trypsin [22] and that HRT-18 cells were susceptible to BCV [10] .

The infectivity of identically DFP-treated Table 3 . (Table 1 ). These results indicate that the AE of the BCV is probably not directly involved in viral uptake during the infectious process. Receptor binding and viral attachment to susceptible cells in infections of non-HA and HA coronaviruses are mediated by the S glycoprotein [19] . The HE protein is not expressed in some murine coronavirus strains [31] . Our finding contrasts a previous report of a 100-fold reduction of infectivity by DFP of another BCV strain plaque-assayed in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells [28] . Infectivity assayed by the plaque test does not address the potential significance of AE in viral spread within an infected cell culture or animal. The AE activity of the HE protein may play a role in facilitating virus release from infected cells and viral spread. BCV particles were seen adsorbed abundantly to the plasmalemma or microvilli. Adsorbed BCV covered the entire exposed surfaces of enterocytes in infections of calves [4] and HRT cells [I 3] . Further insight into the role of HE will be gained through investigations of the interactions of HE with cellular receptors in vitro as well as with the neuraminidate-containing glycokalyx protecting mucous membranes of the respiratory and intestinal tracts of hosts. The strongly inhibitory function of BSM on HA points in this direction (Table 4) . One difference between the BCV-L9 and BCV-LY-138 strains and the vaccine, Meeker, Fisher and Calf-50 strains involves their interaction with different erythrocytes. Chicken erythrocytes were agglutinated by BCV-L9 and BCV-LY-138 and the RDE functioned. These strains also agglutinated mouse erythrocytes, but elution through RDE activity was minimal. The approximately 100-fold concentrated purified preparations of the other BCV strains agglutinated chicken erythrocytes at low titers which were increased by DFP. The HA titers with mouse erythrocytes were 128 to 256 fold higher, but virtually no RDE function was detectable (Table 1) . This difference was further substantiated ",

The vaccine, Meeker, Fisher, Calf 50 and Miller BCV strains agglutinated mouse but not chicken erythrocytes at infectivity yields of 5 x 105 to 4.5 x 106pFU s/50gl (Table2). The difference in the HA pattern of the avirulent and virulent strains may be determined by straindependent receptor binding properties, or possible differences between Neu 5,9 Acz-containing receptors on chicken and mouse erythrocytes, or the greater abundance of receptors on mouse erythrocytes [ 17] . Further differences between the avirulent strain BCV L9 and the virulent strains are host cell restriction [21, 22] , epitopes for S-specific monoclonal antibodies [6] , and amino acid substitutions among the S and HE proteins [32, 33] . Adaptation of wild-type BCV strains to cell cultures and the associated viral selection clearly involve significant genetic and functional changes. The difference in thermal sensitivity separated AE or R D E activity from the H A function. These studies do not define the structural proteins of BCV involved in HA. Monoclonal antibodies against H E as well as against S inhibited H A by BCV-Lg. The activity of anti HE monoclonal antibodies was predominately against R D E [24] . Purified H E of BCV-L9 had A E activity but agglutinated only mouse erythrocytes while purified S was a more powerful H A for chicken and mouse erythrocytes [17] . The functions of S and HE, and their interplay in receptor binding, HA, and the infectious process of BCV need to be defined.",
