            "text": "Influenza is a burden to the Hong Kong healthcare system and a significant cause for hospitalisation among the paediatric population. Discharge diagnoses for all admissions to publicly funded government (Hospital Authority, HA) hospitals in Hong Kong are recorded in a central computerised database (Clinical Management System, CMS) [1, 2] . A 2002 study using the CMS data showed hospitalisation rates in Hong Kong for influenza to be 3-10 times higher than those reported for children in the United States, equating to nearly 3% of children under 1 year old being hospitalised each year due to influenza [3] . An analysis of the CMS database for July 1997 through June 1999 for children aged less than 15 years reported a primary diagnosis of a respiratory disorder in 37.5% of general paediatric admissions [1] . CMS diagnosis incidence rates of influenza Following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, infection control measures in Hong Kong hospitals were enhanced and many hospitals routinely collect nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) for all children with suspected respiratory infections. This situation has enabled us to analyse data collected routinely through the CMS system and combine this with enhanced laboratory surveillance activities from one hospital to make estimates of influenza disease burden in hospitalised children in Hong Kong. The current analysis compares data for infants aged below 6 months with children below 18 years over a 6-year period (April 2005-March 2011).",

The CMS was rolled out from 1996, and by mid-1997 this information was available for all HA hospitals. Prior to 2000, the majority of HA hospitals only coded the primary diagnosis for most hospital admissions. A database of all paediatric patients admitted to general paediatric and neonatal wards from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2011 was provided by the HA. Respiratory-associated admissions for children aged above 6 days to below 6 months and above 6 days to below 18 years were assessed by these ICD diagnostic groups and by hospital of admission, outcome status (died, discharged home with or without follow-up and transferred to another hospital) and severity as measured by the length of stay. Infants below 7 days of age were excluded from these initial analyses as the large majority of these infants were admitted during the immediate post-partum period due perinatal and neonatal problems. [4] , and October 2008 to March 2011 enhanced diagnostics were available to document additional viral and bacterial pathogens.

Overall 1.6% of admissions in the 6M group and 5.2% in the 18Y group had a positive NPA for influenza (Appendix 7). In both age groups the highest positivity rate was in the 2009/10 period during which time the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1NI) virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) influenza strain circulated but this effect was less marked in the 6M group (Appendix 8).

There were an additional 359 children without a CMS diagnosis of influenza but with a laboratory confirmed result, and 253 with a CMS diagnosis of influenza but without laboratory confirmation. This indicates that a CMS diagnosis of influenza under-estimates disease burden relative to the laboratory results despite wide and routine laboratory testing with NPAs in children with fever or respiratory illnesses. Since there appeared to be no obvious age effect (Appendix 3) an overall mean value of 1.05 was used for adjustment factor 1 for all age groups. Of the 11,063 children with a primary-respiratory associated diagnosis, 1490 did not have an NPA sent. Adjustment factor 2 assumed the influenza positive rate in these 1490 children was the same as in the 9573 children that had an NPA sent (Table 1) . Again this factor did not appear to vary consistently with age and overall mean value of 1.13 was applied to all age groups (Appendix 3). Adjustment factor 3 was the proportion of all admissions by age group that had a laboratory diagnosis of influenza at PWH (Table 1 ). This factor varied by age group and a smoothed value excluding the first two months was applied to each monthly age group for the complete HA dataset (Appendix 3).",

This was less than for those children coded as having lower respiratory infections (bronchitis, chest infection, bronchiolitis and pneumonia). Eleven of 549 recorded deaths had a CMS diagnosis of influenza, but in only two children was this recorded as the primary diagnosis and none of these were in the 6M group (Appendix 11). Children with influenza were more likely to be discharged home without follow-up. This pattern was similar to those children with other respiratory-associated diagnoses but overall children were more commonly discharged with follow-up. The median length of stay for the laboratory confirmed influenza admissions at PWH were also 2 days (interquartile range 1.3 days) for most of the study years and for most of the influenza types (Appendix 12). However by categorising length of stay into three groups (<2 days, 2 days, >2 days), there were significant differences between the different influenza types with more children admitted with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 having stays of less than 2 days and more children with influenza B having longer stays (Table 3) .",

Our study aimed to assess the disease burden of influenzaassociated hospitalisation for young infants below 6 months of age in Hong Kong. Our results indicated that the unadjusted incidence rates per 100,000 person-years based on any CMS diagnosis of influenza hospitalisation (CMS flu) for all admissions to HA hospitals in Hong Kong were 627 in the below 2 months age group and peaked at 1762 in the 2 months to below 6 months age group. We previously reported incidence rates per 100,000 for the period 1997-1998 that were substantially less than our current estimates ( Table 4 ) [1] , possibly reflecting that NPAs were not routinely requested for all respiratory-associated admissions prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. It is also likely that the overall incidence rates in our current study have been inflated by the increased numbers of influenza admissions during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic period during 2009/10. Our current rates are also higher than those of another recent Hong Kong study [7] , but lower than those of an earlier report by the same group (Table 4 ) [3] . However, the burden of disease alters in relation to both the vaccine coverage in these children and the protection elicited by the vaccines that covered the circulating virus strain types of the respective seasons. We were unable to differentiate between cases infected with vaccine-covered or nonvaccine-covered strains as not all patients had their virus isolates characterised. However, based on the data provided by the National Influenza Reference Laboratory However, data suggested the uptake rate among infants 6-23 months was low at 8.5% during the 2005/6 flu season [8] , but the introduction of governmental subsidies to influenza vaccination for aged 6-59 months since 2008 may have improved vaccine uptake. Pregnant women are a high risk group that can benefit from seasonal influenza vaccination and recent studies have suggested that their infants will also enjoy some degree of protection [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

            "text": "This analysis shows the potential of combining laboratory surveillance and passive discharge diagnosis surveillance to monitor disease burden of vaccine-preventable pathogens [1, 2] . Using laboratory surveillance from one or more sentinel sites, it is possible to monitor disease coding and revise estimates of disease burden based on discharge diagnoses. However even with a practice of routine NPA testing for respiratory related illness, not all children will have specimens collected for laboratory confirmation. In our analysis we have made estimates of possible increased disease burden had all children had specimens taken. The laboratory surveillance at PWH suggested that up to 1.6% of infants aged above 6 days and below 6 months of age and 5.2% of children aged above 6 days to below 18 years are admitted to hospital as a result of influenza infection. We adjusted the CMS flu diagnosis estimates using factors derived from linking our laboratory surveillance results at PWH to the CMS coded diagnoses and then extrapolated these adjustments to the whole of Hong Kong. These adjusted rates were generally higher than the unadjusted rates (Figs. 2 and 3 ). During the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009/10 the proportion of children aged above 6 days to below 18 years admitted to hospital who had a diagnosis of influenza almost doubled (9.8%). Reasons for this increase incidence during 2009/2010 could reflect a genuine increase in disease burden or alternatively it could reflect changes in admission policy e.g. all suspected A(H1N1)pdm09 infections, including mild cases, were recommended for admission. Measures for severity of illness in the current study were length of stay, intensive care unit admission and outcome. Severity of influenza as measured by mortality and length of stay did not appear to be greater in the 6M group as compared to the 18Y group. The median length of stay for the A(H1N1)pdm09 admissions was similar to the that of the non-A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza admissions (Appendix 12) but when categorised into groups, a greater proportion of children with A(H1N1)pdm09 had a length of stay less than 2 days (Table 3) , possibly reflecting less severe disease or a greater proportion of admissions with mild disease. However the number of intensive care unit admissions with any CMS diagnosis of influenza was highest during 2009/10. Incidence estimates based on adjustment factor 3 (PWH laboratory confirmed influenza rate) tended to be higher than the other incidence estimates except during 2009/10 ( Fig. 2) , possibly reflecting a sustained high level of routine NPA testing for influenza during the whole study period at PWH, but with other HA hospitals only increasing their NPA testing for influenza from 2009/10.",

            "text": "Limitations to our incidence estimates include a number of assumptions related to admissions to public HA hospitals and the resident Hong Kong population. The proportion of admissions to public hospitals has fallen in recent years and there has been a marked increase in the number of mothers from mainland China delivering in Hong Kong. It is possible that as a result of these social trends our incidence estimates (Table 2 ) are likely to be under-estimates rather than over-estimates since they exclude influenza admissions to hospitals in mainland China. Conversely our adjustment for under-testing (adjustment factor 2) could overestimate true incidence since it is possible that children who are not tested represent a different clinical spectrum of disease, making invalid the assumption that the proportion of influenza positive cases in the untested group is the same as in the tested group. We also did not make any adjustments for children readmitted to the same or different HA hospital with the same influenza infection and for possible nosocomial infections which could have led to an over-estimation of incidence. It is also likely that children with nosocomial influenza will have a longer length of stay, emphasising that length of stay does not consistently reflect disease severity. We have also assumed that the adjustment factors derived from one institution, PWH, can be applied uniformly across all the HA hospitals, and that these factors are stable over time. Although PWH is one of the largest HA hospitals accounting for about 10% of all the public hospital paediatric admissions, it is possible that there may be differences in clinical practices, admission policies and laboratory services between PWH and other HA hospitals and also over time.",

Incidence per 100,000 person-years was particularly high for infants aged 2 months to below 6 months of age (1762) but lower in those below two months of age (627). Overall these estimates are higher than our previous 1997-1998 estimates but similar to other Hong Kong estimates. Although a higher positivity rate for influenza was noted during the 2009/10 influenza surveillance period when A(H1N1)pdm09 started to circulate, this could reflect a permissive admission policy rather than increased disease burden and/or severity. Our data support the recommendation that effective vaccination of pregnant women is likely to have a significant impact on reducing disease burden in young infants below 6 months of age hospitalised for influenza.",
