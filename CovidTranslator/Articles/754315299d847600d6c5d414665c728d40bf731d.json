[7] [8] [9] Whilst awaiting the effectiveness of a series of measures to be seen, such evolving outbreak is expected to impose substantial burdens on healthcare system. Normally, a regional university-based hospital in China is equipped with 500-1,000 beds with only a small portion allocated for isolation purpose. Arising from the forecasting demands, increasing numbers of isolation beds and intensive care units (ICUs) for subsequent severe cases will be unquestionably required.

The parameters included in the model were transition probabilities from one state to another within one cycle in the SIR model, i.e., one day.

Thus, the probabilities of recovering in any given day in the hospital were estimated by 1 divided by the average number of days in isolation ward (Iso_recover) or ICU (ICU_recover). We also assumed that a total of 5% of the confirmed cases admitted to isolation ward would experience deterioration of the symptoms and be transferred to ICU. Therefore, in any one day, the probability of being transferred to ICU from isolation ward (ICU_after_Isolation) was estimated by 5% divided by the average number of days in isolation ward. We considered an overall death rate of 14% among the hospitalised cases according to the recent investigation by researchers from the University of Hong Kong. [11] Therefore, the probability of being dead within any given day in the ICU (death_rate) was estimated by 14% divided by the average number of days in ICU.

For the reason of mild or moderate symptoms reported by part of infected cases and the relatively long incubation period observed, it is reasonable to model a context of low diagnosis rate. In fact, recent investigation also suggests the current diagnosis rate could be low and likely lower than 10%. [13] Our estimates appear to be close to the recently published estimates [13] .

In light of no available specific vaccines and treatments for such novel coronavirus thus far, a range of precautionary behaviours between individuals at homes and in communities are essential and vital to obtain proper control of the spreads in public and likely preventing superspreading events. Personal prevention strategies for seasonal influenza and other viral infections are still applicable during the present outbreak, inclusive of restricting ill residents from common activities, excluding symptomatic persons from entering homes/facilities, limiting visit especially of wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. Maintaining personal hygiene (e.g., frequently performing hand hygiene, washing hands with soap and water) and cough etiquette (e.g., covering nose and mouth when coughing, correctly disposing wasted tissues after coughing) are also beneficial. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.27.922443 doi: bioRxiv preprint Amongst these preventive practices, facemask wear appears to be the most operationalised and thus effective since it is observable from other members of the public. A recent cluster randomised controlled trial [16] , consisting of multiple region-varying medical settings, showed both N95 respirators and medical masks can effectively prevent influenza and other viral respiratory infections. Apart from facemask wear being required in public of the epicentre city in Hubei province, it has also been mandated by the Guangdong provincial government that facemasks should be worn in public with effect from 26 th January, four days after the implementation in Wuhan. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States, also emphasised the importance of wearing a facemask at all times when staying with infected individuals in shared spaces as one of precautions for large-scale spreads in community, specified in their interim guidance for prevention for 2019-nCoV from spreading in home and communities [17] . All these are extremely important in raising awareness in the public as to personal preventive steps given the present situation (mild or subclinical symptoms observed in many cases and observed long incubation period).",

However, in the scenario of 10% diagnosis rate, the predicted number of beds occupied is expected to soar and would reach 103,131 in isolation ward and 27,277 in ICU by the end of January.",
