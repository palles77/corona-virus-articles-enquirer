            "text": "Accurate assessment of neutralizing antibody activities is important either for patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or for animals and volunteers immunized with the experimental vaccines against the SARS associated coronavirus (SCV). However, the current assay based on the cytopathic effect (CPE) which has been frequently cited in literature has several limitations. The CPE assay relies on the visual observation on the damage of SCV infected target cells under a microscope. It is subjected to observer variations and it is difficult to generate a quantitative determination of neutralizing activities based on the level of CPE. In the current study, we established the utility of two additional assays to measure the neutralizing activities against SCV: the plaque reduction (PR) and the neutral red staining (NRS) assays. The PR assay described in this study was modified from the traditional viral plaque reduction assay by using an improved crystal staining method to achieve better plague formation in SCV infected Vero E6 cells. The NRS neutralization assay was adopted from a similar system used for detecting neutralizing antibody responses against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In this assay, the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies was determined by the cell viability which is measured by the uptake of neutral red dye at A 540 . The neutralizing antibody titers can be easily determined with either of the two new assays. In this report, we described the utility of these two new neutralization assays in measuring the neutralizing activities against SCV infection from rabbit sera immunized with various forms of spike protein of SCV.

SCV can be transmitted rapidly from person to person with an approximately 11% case fatality rate. Although the first epidemic had been successfully contained and only very few new cases were reported after fall of 2003 (Enserink, 2003; Normile, 2004a,b) , SARS still remains a threat due to its highly transmittable nature to human populations and the mysterious origin of SCV (Arita et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2003; Inouye, 2003; Ratzan, 2003; Sampathkumar et al., 2003; Tong and Liang, 2004) . Currently, there are no proven antiviral drugs effective for this viral infection Holmes, 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Normile, 2004b) . Developing effective vaccines against SCV is the most cost-effective approach to achieve protection in a large population susceptible to SCV infection.",

This method relies on the direct observation of damaged target cells from SCV infection under a microscope. However, the results can be influenced by the subjective interpretation from the researchers, and it is not easy to quantitatively determine the neutralizing activities based on the degree of cytopathic effect.

Therefore, it is difficult to come up with a titration curve to measure the strength of a neutralizing antibody with serially diluted testing antibodies.",

The same neutral red staining method can be applied to Vero E6 cells, the target cells for SCV infection, despite they are adherent epithelial cells and form monolayer attached to the tissue culture plates. After staining and washes, the healthy Vero E6 cells will hold the neutral red dye but not the damaged cells after being infected by SCV. The proportions of healthy cells could be determined by reading the absorbance of neutral red at A 540 of each well.

It appears that the neutral red staining was the most sensitive method in detecting positive neutralizing activities. The overall pattern on the levels of neutralizing antibody activities among positive rabbit sera was very similar and independent of the type of assays used. Rabbit serum specific for S1.1 fragment always had the highest neutralizing activities and rabbit serum specific for S2 subunit had the least positive neutralizing activities (Table 1) . These two regions on Spike protein of SCV were shown to be the two neutralizing domains (Wang et al., 2005) . Rabbit sera elicited by larger S antigens (either the full length S protein or the entire S1 subunit) showed some variation of neutralizing antibody activities when different neutralization assays were used. It is possible that antibodies targeting at non-neutralizing epitopes in these sera may interfere with the antibodies targeting at the neutralizing epitope. The prebleed sera and sera from rabbits immunized with either vector control or S1.2 fragment DNA vaccine did not show any positive neutralizing activities by any of the three assays, indicating the overall high specificities of these tests. Results in Table 1 were calculated based on four independent experiments for each of the three assays (Fig. 4) . Experiment-to-experiment variations or the assay reproducibility for both plague reduction and neutral red staining assays were much better than the CPE assay. Serum dilution % neutralization Fig. 3 . SCV neutralization titers were determined by neutral red staining assays. Percent of viable cells as determined by the neutral red staining was plotted against dilutions of testing rabbit sera. Each curve represents the results of one rabbit serum: positive anti-S rabbit sera (RS004 and RS005) and the negative control rabbit serum (RS001). The levels of neutralizing activities can be shown as the percent inhibition of SCV infection to Vero E6 cells as compared to the viral control wells. For example, the neutralizing titers can be determined by using the 50% inhibition as the cut-off line as shown in the figure. ",

We discovered that the molecular weight of methylcellulose was very important for the plaque formation. When the 1% methylcellulose 4,000 CP in maintenance medium was used as the overlay medium, it produced easily visible plaques on the testing plates. However, other methylcellulose compounds with lower or higher molecular weights could not achieve the same results. This finding re-established the utility of plaque assay for SARS research. This assay can be used for pathogenesis studies to monitor the viral titers without using more complicated molecular or biochemical analyses to quantify the amounts of SCV. This procedure can lower the risk of handling hazardous SCV which has high potential of human transmission as shown in previous laboratory accidents (Normile, 2004a,c; Watts, 2004) . The same improved plaque formation technique can also be applied to study other viruses which may also have difficulty in producing plaques with visible sizes.",

Previously the same technique was used for HIV-1 neutralization assay in which HIV-1 infected MT-2 cells were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates pre-coated with poly-Llysine to capture the suspended MT-2 cells for neutral red staining (Montefiori et al., 1998) . The captured healthy cells could uptake and hold neutral red dye without being washed off by PBS but not the infected cells which formed synthicia or CPE. The cell viability could be easily determined by measuring the absorbance of neutral red dye released from cells after extracting with acid alcohol. Although the Vero E6 cells are adherent epithelial cells attached to the bottom of tissue culture plates, we demonstrated that direct staining of the Vero E6 cells infected with SCV in the plate worked very well. In order to achieve the best reading, special attention should be placed on the number of cells seeded on the plate, virus/cell ratio, and the concentration of neutral red. Too many cells seeded would generate high background of the staining due to over-grown cells. On the other hand, if the cell numbers were too low, the difference between the A 540 reading of cell controls and the A 540 reading of viral controls would also be small as the denominator to calculate the percentage of the neutralization. The preferred range of A 540 differences between viral infected well and cell controls well should be around~1.",

The CPE assay is simple and does not require any special reagents or devices other than a regular light microscope. However, the scoring of SCV induced CPE under microscope could be highly subjective and sometimes the results reported by different observers may vary. Since the CPE score is mainly based on the morphology of cell conditions, which is an evolving process, it is difficult to standardize the scoring based on the degrees of CPE. In our previous study, a more stringent standard was used for the CPE based neutralization assay: it was scored positive once any CPE-like morphology of the cells was observed. Although CPE assay is useful, it would be ideal to develop more quantitative and objective assays.",
