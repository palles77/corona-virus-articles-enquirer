There are three main pathways of IL-6 signal transduction [14, 17] In the classical signal transduction pathway [18] , IL-6 binds to its receptor IL-6R to form a complex, and then binds to the membrane protein gp130 to initiate intracellular signal transduction. IL-6R exists not only in transmembrane form, but also in soluble form. IL-6 binds to these two forms and then interacts with gp130 to trigger downstream signal transduction and gene expression [19] [20] [21] . In the trans signal transduction pathway, the binding affinity of sIL-6R to IL-6 is similar to that of IL-6R, and this complex binds to gp130, which initiates intracellular signal transduction. In the classical signal pathway, many cells cannot respond to IL-6 signal because they do not express IL-6R, but some of these cells can be stimulated by sIL-6R-IL-6 complex to respond to IL-6 signal and cause cell signal transduction [22, 23] . The trans presentation signal is suppressed by extracellular sgp130, and sgp130 can form a complex with sIL-6R to prevent sIL-6R from binding to membrane-bound gp130 [16] . ",

The combination of IL-6 and cell-related IL-6R leads to gp130 homologous dimerization and initiates downstream pathway. However, when the level of IL-6 increases, IL-6 signal is widely expressed, because gp130 is everywhere. The binding of tocilizumab with cell-related IL-6R and soluble IL-6R can inhibit classical and trans signals. So, it can inhibit CRS.",

            "text": "Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against human interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor of immunoglobulin IgG1 subtype. Tocilizumab specifically binds soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R) and inhibits sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signal transduction. It has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [40] and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [41] . In addition, it has also been reported that it plays a certain role in Castleman disease [42] and Crohn's disease [43] . It is worth noting that tocilizumab is effective in the treatment of severe CRS patients [44, 45] . The recommended dose of tocilizumab is 8mg / kg intravenous drip every 4 weeks, for adult with rheumatoid arthritis, which can be used in combination with methotrexate or other anti-rheumatic drugs. When liver enzyme abnormality, neutrophil count and platelet count decrease, the dose of tocilizumab can be reduced to 4mg/kg. For systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) patients, the dose of tocilizumab was 12mg/kg (body weight<30kg) and 8mg/kg (body weigh\u226530kg). Intravenous drip every 2 weeks is recommended, and the drip time is more than 1 hour.",

Interestingly, two RWE studies have come to a different conclusion from aforementioned RCT study. In the Kim SC et al. study[50], cardiovascular events in tocilizumab and Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors (TNFi) were compared, and after strict propensity score matching, 9218 tocilizumab and 18810 TNFi were included. The cardiovascular incidence rate of tocilizumab was 0.52 per/100 person-years, and TNFi was 0.59 per / 100 person-years. The combined HR is 0.84 (95% CI 0.56 -1.26). Another RWE study of Xie FL et al.[51] came to a similar conclusion that there was no significant difference in the risk of cardiovascular events associated with the use of tocilizumab compared with TNFi (HR[Medicare database]=0.79,95%CI 0.65-0.96; HR[MarketScanned database]=0.84, 95% CI 0.52-1.37). Although the conclusion of RCT study was slightly different from RWE studies, the 95%CI of all studies is not significant (that is, it contains 1), so tocilizumab increases cardiovascular events was insufficient. In August 2017, the FDA of the United States approved tocilizumab for the treatment of CRS caused by CAR-T (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Immunotherapy)",
