That is, as the prevalence of a disease is reduced, the density of immune individuals drops, the density of susceptible individuals rises and disease is more likely to rebound. The resultant temporal trajectories are difficult to predict without considering this nonlinear interplay. For instance, many microbial diseases exhibit periodic spikes in the number of cases that are unexplainable by pathogen natural history or environmental phenomena. By explicitly defining the nonlinear processes underlying infectious disease spread, transmission models illuminate these otherwise opaque systems.",

For example, a seminal within-host model fit to viral load data by Perelson et al. 11 revealed high turnover rates of HIV-1, counter to what was then the prevailing assumption that HIV-1 remained dormant during the asymptomatic 'latency' phase. The corollary to these high rates of viral turnover was that drug resistance would likely evolve rapidly under monotherapy. Further analyses of this model indicated that a combination of at least three drugs was necessary to maintain drug sensitivity 12 . Once combination therapy did become available, extension of the Perelson et al. model demonstrated that the two-phase decline in viral load observed following treatment initiation was attributable to a reservoir of long-lived infected cells 13 . With this insight also came the realization that prolonged treatment would be necessary to suppress viral load. The incorporation of",

Epidemiological modelling is a tool that can be used to mitigate this risk by predicting disease spread or quantifying the impact of different intervention strategies on disease transmission dynamics. We illustrate how four decades of methodological advances and improved data quality have facilitated the contribution of modelling to address global health challenges, exemplified by models for the HIV crisis, emerging pathogens and pandemic preparedness. Throughout, we discuss the importance of designing a model that is appropriate to the research question and the available data. We highlight pitfalls that can arise in model development, validation and interpretation.

Such models are capable of incorporating data with individual-level granularity, including those regarding contact patterns, patient treatment cascades and clinical outcomes. Individual-based models are uniquely suited for representing overlap in individual-level risk factors and translating the implications of this overlap for public health policy.

At this scale, compartmental models shift in focus from the pathogen to the host. Unlike individual-based models, compartmental models will aggregate individuals with a similar epidemiological status. For instance, the archetypical 'S-I-R' model separates the entire population of interest into one of three categories: S, susceptible to infection; I, infected and infectious; or R, recovered and protected 19 . In practice, most models will have additional compartments or stratification beyond this simple structure. Age stratification is essential when either the disease risk or the intervention is age-specific. As an example, an age-stratified multipathogen model demonstrated that schistosomiasis prevention targeted to Zimbabwean schoolchildren could cost-effectively reduce HIV acquisition later in life 20 . This framework was extended to additional countries with a range of age-specific disease prevalence and co-infection rates to assess the potential value of treating schistosomiasis in adults. Although adult treatment is not usually considered efficient, the model showed that it could be cost-effective in settings with high HIV prevalence 21 . These models strengthened the investment case for treatment of schistosomiasis, an otherwise neglected tropical disease.",

These models impose a structure on contacts between hosts, unlike compartmental models which assume that contacts are random among hosts within a compartment. In a network model, nodes represent individuals and the connections between nodes represent contacts through which infection may spread 22 . Sources for network parameterization may include surveys, partner notification services or phylogenetic tracing 23, 24 . As with individual-based models, network models tend to require significant amounts of data to fully parameterize, but various computational and statistical methods have been developed to analyse the impact of uncertain parameter values on model predictions 25 . Network models are applied to discern the influence of contact structure on disease transmission and on the effectiveness of targeted intervention strategies. For instance, network models predicted that HIV would spread more quickly through sexual partnerships that are concurrent versus serially monogamous, even if the total numbers of sexual acts and partners remain constant 26 . The study prompted a more rigorous engagement of epidemiologists with sociological data to tailor interventions for specific settings 27 . Other network models have focused on the more rapid transmission within clusters of high-risk individuals and slower transmission to lower-risk clusters, a dynamic which explains discrepancies between observed incidence patterns and the expected pattern based on an assumption of homogeneous risks 28 . These studies both illustrate the importance of accounting for network-driven dynamics when individuals are highly aggregated with regards to their risk factors, and when appropriate data for parameterization are available.",

Given that the Chinese provinces with employment opportunities for migrants are also those with the heaviest burden of HIV, migrant workers who acquire HIV often do so in the province where they work. However, government policy requires migrants to return to their home province for treatment. The movement of these workers perpetuates the disease cycle, as new migrants move to fill the vacated jobs and themselves become exposed to elevated HIV risk.

When diseases emerge in new settings, such as Ebola in West Africa and SARS in China, modelling can be rapidly deployed to inform and support response efforts (Fig. 1) . Unfortunately, the urgency of public health decisions during such outbreaks tends to be accompanied by a sparsity of data with which to parameterize, calibrate and validate models. As detailed below, uncertainty analysis-a method of analysing how uncertainty in input parameters translates to uncertainty in model outcome variables-becomes all the more vital in these situations. Media attention regarding model predictions is often heightened during outbreaks, ironically at a time when modelling results are apt to be less robust than for well-characterized endemic diseases. We discuss the importance of careful communication regarding model recommendations and associated uncertainty to inform the public without fuelling excessive alarm. Despite these challenges, and especially if these challenges can be navigated, the timely assessment of a wide range of intervention scenarios made possible by modelling would be particularly valuable during infectious disease emergencies.",

The 2014 Ebola virus outbreak struck a populous region near the border of Guinea and Sierra Leone, sparking a crisis in a resource-constrained area that had no prior experience with the virus. As the caseload mounted and disseminated geographically, it became apparent that the West African outbreak would be unprecedented in its devastation. Models were developed to estimate the potential size of the epidemic in the absence of intervention, demonstrating the urgent need for expanded action by the international community [34] [35] [36] , and to calculate the scale of the required investment 37 . Initial control efforts included a militarily enforced quarantine of a Liberian neighbourhood in which Ebola was spreading. Modelling analysis in collaboration with the Liberian Ministry of Health demonstrated that the quarantine was ineffective and possibly even counterproductive 38 . Connecting the microbiological and population scales, another modelling study integrated within-host viral load data over the course of Ebola infection and between-host transmission parameterized by contact-tracing data. The resulting dynamics highlighted the imperative to hospitalize most cases in isolation facilities within four days of symptom onset 39 . These modelling predictions were borne out of empirical observations. Early in the outbreak, when the incidence was precipitously growing, the average time to hospitalization in Liberia was above six days 40 . As contact tracing improved, the concomitant acceleration in hospitalization was found to be instrumental in turning the tide on the outbreak 40 . In another approach, phylogenetic analysis and transmission modelling were combined to estimate underreporting rates and social clustering of transmission 41 . This study informed public health authorities regarding the optimal scope and targeting of their efforts, which were central to stemming the epidemic. Although data can be scarce for emerging pathogens, modellers can exploit similarities with better-characterized disease systems to investigate the potential efficiency of different interventions (Box 1). As vaccine candidates became available against Ebola, ring vaccination was proposed based on the success of the strategy in eliminating smallpox 42 , another microorganism whose transmission required close contact between individuals and for which peak infectiousness occurs after the appearance of symptoms. Compartmental models had suggested parameter combinations for which ring vaccination would be superior to mass vaccination 43 , and methodological advances subsequently allowed for explicit incorporation of contact network data 44 . Modelling based on social and healthcare contact networks specific to West Africa supported implementation of ring vaccination 45 , and the approach was adopted for the clinical trial of the vaccine 46 .",

A pandemic is an event in which a pathogen creates epidemics across the entire globe. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide 49 , exceeding the combined military and civilian casualties of World War 1. While the 2% case-fatality rate of the 1918 strain was approximately 40 times higher than is typical for influenza 50 , pathogenic strains with case-fatality rates exceeding 50% periodically emerge 51 . Modelling has illustrated how repeated zoonotic introductions impose selection for elevated human-to-human transmissibility, which thereby exacerbates the threat of a devastating influenza pandemic 52 . Such threats underscore the importance of surveillance systems and preparedness plans, which can be informed by modelling (Box 1). Transmission models are able to optimize surveillance systems, accelerate outbreak detection and improve forecasting [53] [54] [55] [56] . For example, a spatial model integrating a variety of surveillance data streams and embedded in a user-friendly platform is currently implemented by the Texas Department of State Health Services to generate real-time influenza forecasts (http://flu.tacc.utexas.edu/). Modelling has also motivated the development of dynamic preparedness plans, which adapt in response to the unfolding events of a pandemic, as models identified that adaptive efforts would be more likely to contain an influenza pandemic than static policies chosen a priori 57 . Other pandemic influenza analyses used agestructured compartmental models to study the trade-off between targeting influenza vaccination to groups that transmit many infections but experience relatively low health burdens (for example, schoolchildren) versus groups that transmit fewer infections but experience greater health burdens (for example, the elderly) 58 . Such examples illustrate the insights that modelling has provided to the decision makers charged with maintaining readiness against simultaneously rare but catastrophic situations.",

For example, reports in 1974 of potential neurological side effects from the whole-cell pertussis vaccine led to a steep decline in vaccine uptake throughout the UK, followed by a slow recovery (Fig. 2a) 63 . Vaccine uptake ebbed and flowed over the next two decades, with higher rates of vaccination in the wake of large pertussis outbreaks (Fig. 2b) 61, 63 . Compartmental models analysing the interplay between vaccine uptake and disease dynamics confirmed the hypothesis that increases in vaccination were a response to the pertussis infection risk 61 , and showed that incorporating this interplay can improve epidemiological forecasts.

Researchers are turning to social media to gather information about attitudes toward vaccines and infectious diseases, and to glean clues about vaccinating behaviour 55, 66, 67 . For instance, signals that vaccine refusal is compromising elimination can be detected months or years in advance of disease resurgence by applying mathematical analysis of tipping points to social media data that have been classified on the basis of sentiment using machine learning algorithms 66 . These and other data science techniques might help public health authorities identify the specific communities that are at increased risk of future outbreaks. On shorter timescales, the near-instantaneous availability of social media data facilitates its integration into models developed for outbreak response 55, 66 . Other behavioural factors that have been incorporated into transmission models include attendance at social gatherings, sexual behaviour and commuting patterns-elements which are also often affected by perceived infection risk 59, 68, 69 .",

Models are particularly valuable for comparing alternative strategies, such as administration of different antibiotics within the same hospital ward, temporal cycling of antibiotics and combination therapy [73] [74] [75] [76] . High-performance computing now permits the rapid exploration of multidimensional parameter space. Models can thereby narrow an array of possible interventions down to a subset likely to have the highest impact or optimize between trade-offs, such as effectiveness and cost (Box 1). By contrast, expense, feasibility and ethical considerations may impose more limitations on in vivo investigations (Box 1). Not only can models identify the optimal strategy for a given parameter set, but they can generate the probability that this intervention remains optimal across variation in the parameters. For example, an optimization routine combined with simulation of hospital-based interventions identified combination therapy as most likely to reduce antibiotic resistance 75 . As a complementary approach, modelling can incorporate economic considerations into these evaluations. A stochastic compartmental model showed that infection control specialists dedicated to promoting hand hygiene in hospitals are cost-effective for limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance 74 .",

This challenge is exacerbated for outbreaks of novel emerging diseases given that our understanding of the disease will rely on the unfolding epidemic (Fig. 1) . Not only can the absence of data constrain model design, but sparse data requires extensive sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of conclusions. Univariate sensitivity analyses, in which individual parameters are varied incrementally above and below a point estimate, can identify which parameters most influence model output (Box 1). Such comparisons reveal both salient gaps in knowledge and targets for preventing and mitigating the outbreak (Box 1) 85 . As an outbreak progresses, each day has the potential to provide more information about the new disease, including its duration of latency, the symptomatic period, infectiousness, transmission modalities, underreporting and the case-fatality rate. However, collecting detailed data to inform each of these parameters can strain resources when they are thinly spread during an emergency response. Sensitivity analysis can support clinicians and epidemiologists in prioritizing data collection efforts 86 .",

Adding to this complexity, the ecological parameters vary seasonally and geographically-heterogeneities that may be amplified by socioeconomic factors modulating human exposure to infected mosquitoes 89 . In the absence of the high-resolution data that would be ideal to tailor a mosquitodriven disease system to a given setting, uncertainty analysis can unify parameterization from disparate data sources. In contrast to univariate sensitivity analyses, uncertainty analysis simultaneously samples from empirical-or expert-informed distributions for many or all input parameters. Collaboration between modellers and disease experts is thus instrumental to ensuring the biological plausibility of these parameter distributions 90, 91 . The uncertainty analysis produces both a central point estimate and a range for each outcome, a combination which can inform stakeholders about the best-case and worst-case scenarios as well as the likelihood that an intervention will be successful [92] [93] [94] .",

This tendency results in complicated transmission models that overfit data in much the same way that complicated statistical regressions can overfit data, replicating not only the relevant trends but also the noise in a particular data set.

These methods can be applied to select among models or alternatively to calculate weighted average predictions across models.

In a consortium, several modelling groups develop their models independently, each applying their particular expertise and perspective.

Even today, using data to develop models without knowledge of how the data were collected or the limitations of the data can be risky. Data collected for an alternative purpose can contain gaps or biases that are acceptable for the original research question, yet lead to incorrect conclusions when incorporated for another purpose in a specific model. In ideal circumstances, modellers would be involved in the design of the original study, ensuring both seamless integration of the results into the model and awareness on the part of the modeller with regard to data limitations.

In this respect, the projections are intended to make themselves obsolete 104 . In retrospect and without knowledge of the initial purpose of the model, it may appear that the initial predictions were excessively pessimistic 105 . Additionally, people living in outbreak zones often change their behaviour to reduce infection risks, thereby mitigating disease spread through, for example, reducing social interactions or increasing vaccine uptake (Fig. 2) 59, 61, 66 .

Although predictions at the extreme of sensitivity analyses also tend to be less probable than mid-range projections, there can be a temptation to focus on the most sensational model scenarios. Ensuing public pressure on the basis of misunderstood findings can cause unwarranted alarm and trigger counterproductive political decisions. In both publications and media interactions, underscoring the improbability of extreme scenarios explored during sensitivity analysis, as well as how improved interventions turn a predictive model into a counterfactual one, may pre-empt this pitfall 33 .",

Models have now been developed for virtually every human infectious disease, as well as in many that affect animals and plants, and have been applied across the globe. Interdisciplinary collaboration among empiricists, policymakers and modellers facilitates the development of scientifically grounded models for specific settings and generates results that will be actionable in the real world. Reciprocally, modelling results may guide the design of experiments and field studies by revealing key gaps in our understanding of microbiological systems. Furthermore, modelling is a feasible and cost-effective approach for identifying impactful policies prior to implementation decisions. Through all these avenues, epidemiological modelling galvanizes evidence-based action to alleviate disease burden and improve global health. Vaccine uptake appears to be entrained by surges in infection incidence. Mathematical models can capture the interplay between natural and human dynamics exemplified in this dataset and a wide variety of other study systems.",
