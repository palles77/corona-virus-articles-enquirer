Molecular beacons (MBs) are single-stranded, fluorophore-labeled nucleic acid probes that are capable of generating a fluorescent signal in the presence of target, but are dark in the absence of target. Because of the high specificity and sensitivity characteristics, MBs have been used in variety of fields. In this review, MBs are introduced and discussed as diagnostic tools in four sections: several technologies of MBs will be illustrated primarily; the limitation of MBs next; the third part is new fashions of MBs; and the last one is to present the application of MBs in disease diagnosis.",

            "text": "Molecular beacons (MBs) are single-stranded, fluorophorelabeled nucleic acid probes that are capable of generating a fluorescent signal in the presence of target, but dark in the absence of target. Since the first report (Tyagi and Kramer 1996) , they have been widely used in chemistry, biology, biotechnology, and medical science (Antony and Subramaniam 2001; Tan et al. 2000) . The unique hairpin structure and signaling mechanism make MB with several advantages. First of all, the light-up signaling mechanism allows it to function as a highly sensitive probe (Deiman et al. 2002; Tan et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2005) . The unbound MB does not emit fluorescent signal, thus the signal from target bound MB can be clearly observed in the presence of unhybridized probe. Such detection without separation property is useful for the MB in situations where it is either impossible or undesirable to isolate the probe-target hybrids from an excess of the unbound MB, for instance, monitoring of mRNA inside of living cells. Another advantage of MBs is their relatively high signal-to-background ratio, providing higher sensitivity (Deiman et al. 2002; Santangelo et al. 2006; Tan et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2005) . Upon hybridization of its target, a well-designed MB can generate as high as 200-fold of fluorescence enhancement under optimal conditions. This provides the MBs with a significant advantage to other fluorescent probes. In addition to its sensitivity, MBs offer excellent selectivity (Deiman et al. 2002; Santangelo et al. 2006; Tan et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2005) . They are extraordinarily target-specific, and able to differentiate nucleic acid targets with single base mismatches. The selectivity of MBs is a direct result of its loop and stem structure, as the stem hybrid acts as a counterweight to the loop-target hybrid. Because of the advantages above, MBs technology not only share wide range of applications in the study of biology, but also play an important role in the diagnosis of genetic diseases. In recent years, the structure of MBs has been made many improvements (Li et al. 2008) . The specificity and sensitivity of new fashions MBs are higher than the traditional MBs (Nitin et al. 2004; Santangelo et al. 2004 Santangelo et al. , 2006 . Herein, MBs technology has been increasingly applied in diseases diagnosis.",

The shorter stem length has faster hybridization kinetics but suffers from lower signal-to-background ratio. 3. 5 0 Fluorophore The 5 0 end of the MB is attached a dye that fluoresces in presence of a complementary target. The most commonly used dyes are 5-(2 0 -aminoethyl) aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDNAS), fluorescein (Fam), tetrachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (Tet), hexachloro-6-carboxy fluorescein (Hex) and tetramethylrhodamine (Tamra) and 5-carboxyrhodamine-X (Rox). Proper selection of fluorophore is critical for improved signal-to-background ratio. 4. 3 0 Quencher (non-fluorescent) Capture and transfer of light energy from an excited fluorophore is referred as quenching and the substances involved are termed as quenchers. The quencher dye is covalently attached to the 3 0 end of the MB. When the beacon is in closed loop shape, the quencher prevents the fluorophore from emitting light. The commonly used quencher, 4-(4 0 -dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid DABCYL, is a non-fluorescent chromophore, has a strong quenching efficiency variety of fluoresceins. Dubertret used gold nanoparticles cluster instead of DABCYL, they also worked out various quenching agents by altering the shape, size and composition of metal nanoclusters (Tyagi and Kramer 1996) .",

            "text": "Resonance energy transfer (RET) is one of the fundamental principles of MBs (Ortiz et al. 1998; Tyagi and Kramer 1996) . It is used for signal transduction. Energy transfer is the transfer of the excited state energy from the initially excited donor to an acceptor. Donor molecules typically emit at wavelengths which overlap with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor (Yang et al. 2005) . RET occurs without the appearance of a photon and is the result of long range dipole-dipole interactions between the donor and acceptor. Energy transfer rates depend on the extent of spectral overlap of the emission spectrum of the donor with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor, the quantum yield of the donor, the relative orientation of the donor and acceptor molecules and the distance between the donor and the acceptor. The distance at which RET is 50 % efficient is characterized as the Forster distance and is typically in the range of 20-60 \u00c5 . Molecular beacons are designed to form a stem-loop (hairpin) structure which can hold the fluorophore at 5 0 end and the quencher at 3 0 end in close proximity to one another, preventing the fluorophore from emitting a signal as a result of RET. Hybridization with target nucleic acids opens the hairpin and physically separates the reporter from quencher, allowing a fluorescence signal to be emitted upon excitation ( Fig. 1 ) (McDonald et al. 2002; Tan et al. 2005) . The length and sequence of probe loop and stem, hairpin structure, and fluorophore/quencher selection are critical design issues for MBs (Santangelo et al. 2006) . The design parameters are described below. The process of MB design begins with the selection of the probe sequence. It is really a crucial step for the functions of MBs, because the probe sequence determines the specificity and the target accessibility. In practice, the choices of the probe sequence are limited by target-specific considerations, such as the sequence context surrounding a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of interest, and using the NCBI BLAST or similar software to select multiple target sequences that are unique for the target nucleic acids. The probe length can be adjusted to a specific application of a MB. Typically, the length of the probe sequence is in the range between 15 and 30 nucleotides in the past.",

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Texas red and the luciferase (5-(2aminethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, EDANS) are commonly used as fluorophore. Since each MB possesses only one fluorophore, it is possible to use multiple MBs in the same assay, assuming the fluorophores are chosen with minimal emission overlap. MBs can even be labeled simultaneously with two fluorophores. They will be described in below content (new fashions of MBs). Terminus 4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)azo)-benzoyl (DABCYL) is most commonly used as the quencher in MBs technology. There are many other quenchers besides DABCYL, such as blackhole quencher (BHQ) and Iowa black. They can all effectively quench a wide range of fluorophores. In addition to quenchers mentioned above, gold nanoparticles can also be used as a quencher (Dubertret et al. 2001; Li and Rothberg 2004; Wu et al. 2006) . The nanocluster fluorescence quenching reagent is more efficient, sensitive and specific. Recently quencher-free MBs (QF-MBs) are designed for identification of the fully matched target sequences in the presence of even large excess of mismatched DNAs (Venkatesan et al. 2008) . And the QF-MBs have several advantages over the quencher-fluorophore MB systems. For example, mono-labeled QF-MBs can be immobilized over solid surface easily through the free end.",

It has been proved that at low temperature MBs exist in a closed state, the fluorophore and the quencher are held in close proximity to each other by the hairpin stem, and there is no fluorescence. However, at high temperature, the helical order of the stem gives way to a random-coil configuration, separating the fluorophore from the quencher and restoring fluorescence. If a target is added to a solution containing a MB when the temperature is below the melting temperature of its stem, the MB spontaneously binds to its target, dissociating the stem, and turning on its fluorescence. How the fluorescence of the probe-target hybrid varies with the temperature is indicated by the blue fluorescence versus temperature trace. While at low temperature, the probe-target hybrid remains brightly fluorescent, but as the temperature rising, the probe dissociates from the target and return to its hairpin state, diminishing the fluorescence obviously (Vet et al. 2004 ). Gregoire Bonnet found that the transition from probe-target duplex to a closed conformation occurred at 42\u00b0C. As the temperature is raised further, the closed MBs melt into fluorescent random coils (Bonnet et al. 1999) .",

In general, we know that MBs enable a homogenous assay format where background is low without the need to wash away free probes.

It has been demonstrated that wavelength-shifting MBs are substantially brighter than conventional MBs which contain a fluorophore that cannot efficiently absorb energy from the available monochromatic light source. In addition, the second fluorophore of wavelength-shifting MBs can possess differently colored fluorophores, enabling assays to be carried out that simultaneously detect different targets in the same reaction (Santangelo et al. 2006; Takacs et al. 2008; Tyagi et al. 2000) .",

Each beacon contains a fluorescence quencher and a fluorescence reporter, one with a donor fluorophore and the other with an acceptor fluorophore. They had sequences complementary to adjacent regions on the same target so that the two fluorophores would link the FRET range (*6 nm), while both beacons were hybridized to the target. To get the FRET by activating the donor fluorophore and detecting the fluorescence emission at a wavelength characteristic of the acceptor fluorophore, the positive result should be ensured because of binding both two beacons with the target molecule.

The result demonstrated that, cellular delivery of MBs using the peptide-based approach has far better performance as compared with conventional transfection methods. The advantages of permeation peptide-conjugated MBs are blow: firstly, peptide-linked MBs were internalized into living cells within 30 min with nearly 100 % efficiency. Secondly, peptide-based delivery did not interfere with either specificity or function of MBs. In contrast, liposome-(Oligofectamine) or dendrimer-based (Superfect) delivery of MBs required 3-4 h and resulted in a punctate fluorescence signal in the cytoplasmic vesicles and a high background in both cytoplasm and nucleus of cells (Nitin et al. 2004; Santangelo et al. 2006 ).",

In perspective, the two-color design allows also to quantify the concentration of the target DNA in a sample down to B 1 ng/ll (Kim et al. 2007 ). In another study, MBs were immobilized with polyacrylamide gel for single nucleotide mismatch detection. The result indicates that a polyacrylamide film-coated glass slide provides an ideal solution-like environment for MB probes.

This ability can provide important information concerning the temporal and spatial processing, localization and transport of specific mRNAs under various conditions. To date, people conducted a number of structural improvements and development on MBs, such as wavelength-shifting MBs, dual FRET MBs and permeation peptide-conjugated MBs, so that MB technology can be used in monitoring the level of gene expression in vivo with high sensitivity and low background signal. Molecular beacons proved its potential in decoding the messages coded on mRNA. The use of MB for in vivo studies depends on the combination of rational sequence design, efficient probe insertion in the cell and choice of target mRNA sequence. As a result, a number of rapid diagnosis and prognosis systems of diseases using MBs are being reported from time to time.",

Molecular beacon was applied for quantitative detection of p21 mRNA in cellular total RNA. The results showed that p21 mRNA is inhibited by silencing p53 in CNE2 cells, while it is upregulated in MCF-7 cells by ING1 transfection, the influence of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment on p21 mRNA of MCF-7 cells is time and concentrationdependent manner (Liu et al. 2010a) . After injecting the p21 MB into nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell and p33transfected nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell, the consistent increase of fluorescent signal intensity was detected in both cell lines, and the fluorescence increasing rate was significantly different between these two cell lines, which indicate the different p21 mRNA expression levels (Tang et al. 2008) . These results demonstrated that the new method with the advantages of high specificity, fast speed and simplicity can be widely applied for p21 mRNA detection in different samples.",

They found that quenching efficiency in the ''dual FRET molecular beacon'' format is increased to 88 %, much closer to the 91 % level that has been reported for MB assays. A second benefit of the approach described here is that the portion of probe oligonucleotide that is removed by the enzyme is shorter, thus increasing the rate of probe cleavage. Tsourkas et al. (2003) and Santangelo et al. (2004) used dual FRET MBs for detecting the expression levels and localization of specific endogenous RNA, found that the detection of a FRET Fig. 3 Illustrations of MBs used to detect mRNA in living cells Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. (2013) 61:139-148 signal leads to a substantially increased signal-to-background ratio as compared with that seen in single MB assays and enables discrimination between fluorescence due to the specific probe/target hybridization and a variety of possible false-positive events. Tang et al. (2008) used a phosphorothioate-modified MB detecting green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNA in COS-7 cell and GFP-transfected COS-7 cell in real time based on living cell imaging method. The detection shows the advantages of MB, such as, excellent selectivity, high sensitivity, and no separation detection. In addition, this modification could significantly increase the nuclease resistance of MB, reduce the false-positive signal and improve the accuracy of living cell mRNA detection. Various improvements of MBs design have been done to produce nuclease resistant MB with improved stability at the cytoplasm, such as 2 0 -O-methylated MBs which offer good nuclease resistance and also resist RNase activity (Monroy-Contreras and Vaca 2011). These new approaches allow for the ultrasensitive detection of target molecules in a way that could be readily applied to real-time imaging of gene expression in living cells.",
