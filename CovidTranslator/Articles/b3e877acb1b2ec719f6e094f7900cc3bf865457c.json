This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor hACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with coronaviruses recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different coronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of coronavirus infections. We also propose that a glycine residue at the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein can have a critical role in permitting bat variants of the coronaviruses to infect human cells.",

The first, SARS-CoV emerged in November 2002 in the Guangdong province of China and spread globally during 2002-03, infecting more than 8000 people and causing 774 deaths (Drosten et al., 2003; WHO, 2004) . MERS-CoV was the second emergence and was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and resulted in nearly 2500 human infections and 858 deaths in 27 countries (Fehr et al., 2017; Zaki et al., 2012) . In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a previously unknown coronavirus capable of infecting humans was discovered in the Chinese city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province Zhu et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an ongoing pandemic of atypical pneumonia, now termed coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-2019) that has affected over 209,000 people with 8778 fatalities as of March 19, 2020 (WHO, 2020 . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are thought to have originated in colonies of bats, eventually transmitted to humans, putatively facilitated by intermediate hosts such as palm civets and dromedary camels, respectively (Cui et al., 2019) . The genome of SARS-CoV-2 shares about 80% nucleotide identity with that of SARS-CoV and is 96% identical to the bat coronavirus BatCoV RaTG13 genome, reinforcing the probable bat origin of the virus . However, better assessing the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is an active research priority worldwide.",

Members of this family are enveloped viruses containing a single positive-strand RNA genome of 27-32 kb in length, the largest known RNA virus genome. The coronavirus spherical virion consists of four structural proteins: the spike glycoprotein (S-protein), the envelope protein, membrane protein and nucleocapsid. The transmembrane trimeric S-protein plays a critical role in virus entry into host cells (Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001; Tortorici & Veesler, 2019) . It comprises two functional subunits: S1 subunit, where the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is found, is responsible for binding host cell surface receptors and S2 subunit mediates subsequent fusion between the viral and cellular membranes (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2017) . Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 interact directly with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter host target cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Li et al., 2003; Walls et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) . In the case of SARS-CoV, ACE2 binding was found to be a critical determinant for the virus host range and key amino acid residues in the RBD were identified to be essential for ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV infection and adaptation to humans (Li et al., 2006; Li et al., 2005) .",

Using these approximations, any node predicted by free ratios model with \u03c9>1 was significantly different to the purifying (\u03c9<1) or neutral (\u03c9=1) models. An equivalent analysis was performed using aBSREL of HyPhy, observing episodic diversifying selection in at least 8 of 41 nodes of the phylogenetic tree reconstructed with the 'closer' dataset ( Figure 1 ). Interestingly, one of the divisions detected with diversifying selection was the branch that contains SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin coronavirus isolate MP789 and Bat coronavirus RaTG13 (called SARS-CoV-2 group) but not the specific branch that contains SARS-CoV-2. under positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 using the closer dataset without Pangolin coronavirus isolate MP789. It is interesting despite the influence of the dataset in the results, because site F486 is directly involved in hACE2-RBD interaction , explaining at least in part strong selection at this site. Moreover, the branch-site model bsA (positive selection) vs bsA1 (relaxation) of CODEML were compared to find evidence of sites under positive selection in branch of SARS-CoV-2 using the 'closer' dataset, but bsA does not show significant differences with bsA1 (p>0.05) indicating selection cannot be confidently implicated, but it was when other datasets were used (including F486). In summary, we do find evidence of sites under positive/episodic selection in branches of close related strains of Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate coronavirus. However, there is not strong evidence of specific sites under positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 using the tools mentioned in this work. This result does not disregard the presence of positive selection sites in SARS-CoV-2, nonetheless, it shows the limitation of the methods to identify with precision specific sites under positive selection in a precise taxon of a phylogenetic tree. We further warn researchers need to be conservative with interpretations of studies utilizing these methodologies, given the equivocal results can be generated by datasets varying in genetic similarity.",

In any case, the majority of predicted sites converge in the region between 439 to 508, a section of the RBD. Additionally, we used TreeSaap to detect important biochemical amino acid properties changes over regions and/or sites along betacoronavirus S-protein. Using a sliding window size of 20 (increasing by 1) we detect that the region between 466 to 500 (using SARS-COV-2 S-protein as a reference) have drastic amino acid changes for alpha-helical tendencies. In addition, the section between 448 to 485 residues registers radical changes in amino acids implicated in the equilibrium constant (ionization of COOH). In the structural analysis we performed, the section between 472 to 486 forms a loop that is not present in certain S-proteins of coronavirus isolated in bats. This loop extends the interaction area between RBD of S-protein and human ACE2, in fact, the lack of these loop decreases the negative energy of interaction (increasing the binding) among these two molecules (see Table 2 ). These results obtained from independent analysis strongly highlight the importance of 439 to 508 section. Additionally, important hACE2-binding residues in the RBD from SARS-COV-2 obtained from the crystallography and structure determination performed by Shang et al. (2020) are also present in the section we highlight here. We propose that this region is the most probable to contain the sites under positive selection due to predictions by our CODEML and FUBAR models. In that sense, we refer to this section as Region under Positive Selection (RPS). It is important to additionally clarify that even inside the RPS we found at least 20 aa highly conserved between coronaviruses, several of them are predicted as sites under purifying selection. This shows that it is necessary to maintain sites without change around polymorphic sites, probably to conserve the protein structure and at the same time to have the ability to colonize more than one host.",

These calculations show that the SARS2, SARS and Rs4231 viruses are predicted to favorably bind to the human hACE2 receptor, while the Rm1 and SARS2-MUT variants present unfavorable free energies of binding. The fact that the bat's coronavirus Rs4231, in addition to SARS and SARS2, presents favorable interaction with hACE2 is in accordance with the previous observation that it is able to infect human cells expressing this protein (Hu et al., 2017) . To get more insights into the contribution of the receptor and the RBDs to the binding process, we performed energy decomposition experiments. The contribution of each residue in the studied coronaviruses that interact with the hACE2 receptor are shown in Table 3 .

From here on, residues numeration will take that of SARS2 as reference. In general, most RBDs residues show negative values of contribution to the free energies of binding to the human receptor. All studied RBDs, except that of the Rm1 coronavirus, have amino acids with large favorable contributions to the free energies of binding that directly interact with hACE2: K417 of SARS2 and SARS2-MUT, R426 in SARS and R480 in Rs4231. On the other hand, the G476D mutation (D463 present in bat coronavirus strains) have a negative contribution to the binding of the RDB to hACE2. This site was predicted to be under purifying selection by FUBAR analyses, and is located within the RPS. Strikingly, the G496D mutation (SARS2 numeration) has a large negative influence in the free energy of binding in the two complexes that contain it. It is also worth noting that the three aspartic acid substitutions present in all systems negatively contribute to the systems stability. Taking into account that the only difference between SARS2 and SARS2-MUT is the G496D mutation, we postulate that this RBD position is critical for the human receptor recognition by coronaviruses.

This result supports the prediction from FUBAR analyses indicating that the site G496D is under purifying selection. Combined, our results strongly suggest that the mutation of the D496 residue present in the coronaviruses from bats is critical for their RBDs to recognize the human hACE2 receptor. Additionally, it shows the importance of sites under purifying selection in RPS for the RBD evolution.",

            "text": "Many studies have focused on coronaviruses mutations that favor adaptations for human hosts infections. For example, it has been shown that specific substitutions at positions 455, 486, 483, 494 and 501 (442, 472, 479, 480 and 487 in SARS) of the RBD of SARS favors the interaction between the RBD of SARS and hACE2 (Cui et al., 2019) . Likewise, homology modeling studies found favorable interactions between the residues occupying these positions in the SARS2 RBD and the human receptor . The cornerstone of these favorable interactions is the complementarity of the RBDs with hot spots 31 and 353. These are salt bridges between K31 and E35 and between D38 and K353 of ACE2 which are buried in a hydrophobic environment (see Figure. 2). In the cases of SARS2 and SARS, Q493 (N479 in SARS) and N501 (T487 in SARS) add support to the hot spots according to these previous studies. These observations should also hold for the Rs4231 strain, however the N501A change in the later compared to SARS2 (A488 in Rs4231) add little support to hot spot 353. In this case, to continue permitting human infection, the large favorable contribution of R480 in Rs4231 to the free energy of binding could compensate the weak support provided by A488 to hot spot 353.",

            "text": "Interestingly, K353 is the residue forming the largest network of contacts with the analyzed RBDs among those belonging to both hot spots. Our simulations also show that in SARS2 and SARS the RBD amino acids with the largest contribution to the free energy of binding, K417 and R426 (see Table 3 ) respectively, do not interact with any hot spot residue. Instead, they interact with D30 of hACE2 in the SARS2 complex and with E329 of the human receptor in the SARS complex. This could indicate that interactions additional to those previously identified with the hACE2 hotspots could be critical for the stabilization of the RDB-human receptor complexes. Finally, we analyzed the possible reasons for the predicted negative impact that the G496D mutation has on the predicted free energies of binding of the RBD to hACE2. As depicted in Figure 2 , G496 directly interacts with K353 in hot spot 353 and its mutation interferes with the D38-K353 salt bridge. Specifically, D496 of the RDB point to D38 of hACE yields a high electric repulsion between these amino acids. Consequently, this portion of the RBD is pushed to a position further from hACE2 than that observed in the wild type receptor, resulting in the reduction of its network of contacts with K353. As a result, the binding of the RBD to hACE2 is considerably inhibited and unlikely to occur.",

            "text": "A priority in ongoing research is to better understand coronavirus evolution, with specific interests in understanding the role of selection pressures in viral evolution, and clarifying how viral strains can infect novel hosts. Our experiments suggest that there are sites under positive selection in the S-protein gene of SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses, particularly in a region that we called RPS (Region under Positive Selection) inside of the RBD. However, we have identified that by in large, sites in this region (and overall, in the S-protein gene) are under purifying selection. Particularly, for the site D496G, the presence of aspartic acid seems indispensable for the interaction with the hACE2. Additionally, we performed MD simulations and free energies of binding predictions for five different complexes of coronaviruses that do and do not infect human cells. Our results suggest that as long as no disrupting interference occur with both salt bridges at hot spots 31 and 353 coronaviruses are able to bind with hACE2. Modeling results suggest that interference with the hot spot 353 could be and effective strategy for inhibiting the recognition of the RBD of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein by its human host receptor ACE2 and hence prevent infections. Although additional simulations and experiments are required, all evidence suggests that the mutation of D496 in the bat variants of the coronaviruses permit infection of human cells. Giving the large contribution of SARS2 K417 to the free energy of binding of the RBD to hACE2 we propose that blocking its interaction with the receptor D30 could be a promising strategy for future drug discovery efforts.",

Predicted nodes under episodic diversifying selection (according to predictions generated by aBSREL of HyPhy) were colored in blue. Numbers in the inner nodes represent the number of non-parametric bootstrap replicates MEME of HyPhy detected 40 sites in different branches with signal of episodic positive selection, but FEL did not identify sites under positive selection (with p < 0.1) in the SARS-CoV-2 when 'closer' dataset was used. Depending on the focal dataset analyzed ('close' vs. 'broad'), FEL detected several sites under positive selection in SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating the influence of relatedness within the dataset in branch-sites model predictions. FEL predicted the site F486",

(2020) with FUBAR detects 1065 sites under purifying selection and sites 536 and 644 as under positive selection.These results suggests by in large strong purifying selection is acting over the vast majority of the S-protein gene, with a comparatively low proportion of sites under positive selection. The evidence of a high amount of purifying selection strengthens similar findings previously reported in RNA viruses(Hughes & Hughes, 2007). These results are congruent with the analysis ofTang et al. (2020) performed with entire coronavirus genomes. However, the sites under positive selection reported differ from our results, and from those ofBenvenuto et al. (2020). They found the sites 439, 483 and 439 (counting from the first amino acid of S-protein), our FUBAR analysis found the sites 443 and 445, and FEL found the residue 486 as specific site under positive selection in SARS-COV-2.",
