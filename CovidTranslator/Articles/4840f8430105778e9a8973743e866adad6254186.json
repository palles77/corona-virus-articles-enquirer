In both the logistic regression and the AFT model, several CT imaging characteristics were found to play a key role in affecting test results. Specifically, both GGO and consolidation were identified as key characteristics, but they worked in an opposite manner. As mentioned above, some patients presented characteristic radiographic features of COVID-19 from the first scan, while the nucleic acid test result was falsely negative (11) . And then these patients were confirmed by positive repeat swab testing during the isolated observation or treatment.

Maybe the viral load in the upper respiratory tract determines the time window for testing positive during this different course of COVID-19. The level and duration of infectious virus replication are important factors in assessing the risk of transmission and guiding decisions regarding isolation of patients. For diagnosed COVID-19 patients, a failure of early confirmation through the nucleic acid test could be disastrous. This study aimed to develop multivariate models to explain false negative test results, and further to predict a time window for testing positive. In other words, we also provided direct answers to the variety in the time windows of COVID-19 patients (8).",

While others believe that sampling, patient stages, reagent sources, laboratory operations, and other factors could affect test outcome. Our models help detect a delayed time window of testing positive with the analysis of some clinical characteristics and explained the variety in the time windows of COVID-19 patients. As a result, medical staff should sample at an appropriate time, taking clinical characteristics into consideration, so as to reduce false negatives. Several limitations should be considered when interpreting these findings. Firstly, this is a single center, and retrospective study. The results need more multiple, prospective research to verify it. Secondly, with the exception of the time window, there are other reasons related to false negative results. For example, it has been reported that the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2",
