There will be no benefit from an intervention that is not effective [7] . Healthcare needs assessment must balance clinical, ethical, and economic considerations of need -that is, what services should be provided, how and where should they be provided and on what basis should patients have access to these services? The approach also provides a method of monitoring and promoting equity in the provision and use of health services and addressing inequalities in health [9, 10] . In this study, healthcare needs will be taken to be the population's ability to benefit from health care i.e. preventive, diagnostic or treatment services [11] .

A 100% sample was selected as it was felt important that all practices contribute to planning decisions. There were no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria. A postal questionnaire for selfcompletion by practice managers was constructed using information gathered from the literature and from advice provided by colleagues. The questionnaire was in two parts. The first part was designed to elicit information on whether the GP practice had referred patients to the static DXA scanner in Gobowen in the past 12 months. If they had, they were asked to rate their satisfaction with the service that they had received. They were then asked whether they had had any patients in the previous month who had needed a DXA scan but had refused or been unable to travel to the existing service because of travel distance. The second part of the questionnaire sought to gather information on the opinion of the GP practice on future service options for bone densitometry. The practice was given four options and they were asked to rank these in order of preference and to indicate any that they would not use. The options were 'existing service provided in Gobowen', 'new DXA service based at Llandudno Hospital', 'new DXA service based elsewhere in North Wales' and 'new mobile DXA service covering all of North Wales'. For option 3, the practice was asked where they would like this new service to be located. After piloting the questionnaire at a small number of practices in North Wales, the final version was sent to practice managers, accompanied by a covering letter. This explained the purpose of the study, stated that permission had been obtained from the relevant ethical committees and gave them a contact number for further information. Also included with the questionnaire was a self-addressed Freepost envelope for return of completed questionnaires. Participants were initially given a two-week return date. If they had not responded in another two weeks, they were given a telephone reminder and the opportunity to complete the questionnaire over the phone. The results of the questionnaire were then collated in Excel (spreadsheet software from Microsoft) and analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences).",

A number of practices also commented that their patients had difficulties in accessing Gobowen, especially the more at risk elderly population.
