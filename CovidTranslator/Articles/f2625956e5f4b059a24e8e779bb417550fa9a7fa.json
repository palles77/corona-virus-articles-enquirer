The clinical features caused by EVD and 202 MVD outbreaks are more likely to be caused by other diseases until at least 6 and 7 cases 203 occur, respectively.

Additionally, few studies describing the presentation of 302 syndromes describe heterogeneity in their presentation. We accounted for this heterogeneity 303 by introducing wider clinical feature distributions for those syndromes which represent 304 pooled aetiological agents (e.g., ascribing high heterogeneity to \"diarrhoeal diseases,\" which 305 includes a range of pathogens, and moderate heterogeneity to most clinical features of EVD, 306 which may be caused by several distinct filovirus species). However, more consistent and 307 comprehensive reporting of clinical feature prevalence across strains and settings would 308 enable stronger accounting for heterogeneity in disease presentation. Furthermore, an advantage of our approach is its ability to exploit-rather than work 326 against-the uncertainty inherent in syndromic data from diseases with heterogeneous 327 presentations. Critically, this allows detection of diseases at population levels even before 328 any individual-level diagnosis occurs (e.g., before the development of tests for rare/novel 329 pathogens or in settings with insufficient diagnostic capacity). 330",

Although the epidemiological process 260 underlying this chain of events has received growing attention 25 , the process of clinical 261 detection has rarely been studied directly due to the inherent difficulties of measuring cases 262 and outbreaks that were never recorded. Here we have attempted to address this gap by 263 quantifying how the endemic context in which a disease occurs obscures syndromic signals. tested this model against a range of outbreaks with varying data quality, 267 demonstrating its strong utility in identifying outbreak aetiologies. We have used these new 268 methods to estimate the sensitivity of syndromic surveillance to a range of potentially 269 haemorrhagic fevers. We have also quantified how syndromic overlap between febrile270 syndromes in sub-Saharan Africa affects the expected number of cases required to detect 271 outbreaks across the region. Finally, by incorporating geospatial estimates of the incidences 272 of common febrile syndromes, we have provided evidence for \"hidden hotspots\" where Ebola 273 virus is both likely to spill over and especially difficult to detect, creating spaces suitable for 274 unchecked transmission before detection and intervention is possible 1 . 275 276 Algorithmic outbreak identification and syndromic detectability. 277 278 Our syndromic surveillance model, which combines the prior incidences and clinical profiles 279 of a range of diseases to predict the causes of clinical feature clusters, presents a more 280 mechanistic approach than other models intended for outbreak attribution 26 .

Our methods have the additional strengths of being scalable, 321 clinically interpretable, tolerant of missing data, and useful in the presence of different 322 clinical feature combinations.

While cross-382 validated on subsets of known spillovers and built on independent, underlying ecological data 383 (i.e., fruit bat and non-molossid microbat diversity, bat demographic patterns, and human 384 population density), such models still face fundamental challenges related to potential 385 spatially heterogeneous observation biases. More consistent ecological data collection, 386 especially related to bat abundance estimates and migratory patterns, could help overcome 387 interest 35 , or incorporate other dimensions of spatiotemporal heterogeneity like seasonal 403 spillover risk. These dimensions might be especially informative for ruling out arboviral 404 diseases 41,42 , but could also be informative for filoviruses as spillover drivers become clearer 405 43 . 406 407 Syndemic interactions among diseases further complicate the detection process. Ecological 408 risk factors are likely to be clustered within populations, especially for the handful of diseases 409 that share zoonotic reservoirs (EVD and MVD) or mosquito vectors (dengue, yellow fever, 410 and nearly a dozen other emerging viruses). Corresponding social risk factors-like food 411 insecurity and water storage, or limited access to primary healthcare-are also highly 412 spatially correlated, further increasing the odds that these diseases cluster together at fine 413 spatial scales. These factors compound any potential biological associations between diseases 414 44 , and resulting co-morbidities can alter clinical presentations, complicating both diagnosis 415 and treatment. This makes outbreak dynamics more complex, and potentially more severe, 416 than each disease would normally cause in isolation 15 . This is a particular problem for 417 emerging viruses, which may have poorly characterized clinical presentations and case 418 definitions for several years after emergence 45 ; failure to characterise new syndromes in full 419 can delay a national or global response by weeks or months, with strong consequences for the 420 rate of epidemic spread 1 . For example, recent work suggests that the majority of Zika cases 421 in the Americas were likely misidentified as chikungunya and dengue, long before the 422 outbreak was formally reported 46 . Recent work also suggests that official case definitions for 423 Zika by the World Health Organization miss a majority of paediatric Zika cases because the 424 case definitions target the disease's adult manifestation, which is substantially different than 425 its appearance in children 13 . Similar risks are apparent for EVD and MVD, especially in the 426 hotspots we identify. 427 428 While some of our predicted hidden hotspots overlap with recently estimated hotspots for 429 EVD epidemic risk, we introduce several new predicted areas of risk based on the difficulty 430 of detection. For example, both southeastern Guinea and northeastern Democratic Republic 431 of Congo emerged as hidden hotspots in our model, were identified as hotspots in recent 432 epidemic risk models 47,48 , and have served as the geographic origins of the two largest 433",

However, our 441 predictions are supported by their correspondence with serosurveys and a lack of reported 442 outbreaks despite high ecological suitability 49-51 . Moderately high seroprevalence of 443 filovirus antibodies has been observed in wildlife and/or human populations in these regions 444 49,51-58 , but human outbreaks have rarely been reported 59 .

Similar analyses could, for example, lead to the 453 establishment of geographically adaptable case definitions that are maximally sensitive and 454 specific to their local endemic contexts.
