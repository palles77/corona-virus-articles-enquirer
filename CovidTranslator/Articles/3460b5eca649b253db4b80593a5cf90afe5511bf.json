The NS5 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by His-tag based affinity chromatography. This recombinant NS5 protein exhibited RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity in vitro in the absence of other viral or cellular factors. The RNA polymerase activity was dependent on divalent cations, and Mn 2\u00fe was found to be 20 times more effective than Mg 2\u00fe in coordinating the catalytic reaction of RdRp, while Ca 2\u00fe inhibited enzyme activity. The optimal reaction conditions for the in vitro RdRp reaction were established. Characterization of the RdRp reaction products demonstrated that the JEV NS5 protein can initiate RNA synthesis through a de novo initiation mechanism in our in vitro reaction system. Comparing the efficiency of different RNA templates, we found that JEV NS5 protein was more efficient in using negative-strand RNA templates, indicating that the JEV NS5 protein is in-volved in regulating the ratio of positive-to negativestrand RNA. Four amino acid sequence motifs crucial for RdRp activity were also identified using site-directed mutagenesis analysis. All substitutions of the conserved residues within these motifs led to a complete inactivation or severe loss of enzyme activity.",

Hence, assuming that the two terminal regions of the JEV genome contain domains that are important for the regulation of RNA replication, we compared the efficiency of RNA synthesis with templates of the plus-or the minus-strand JEV virus RNAs. Approximately 1-kilobase(kb) RNAs corresponding to the regions of the 3 0 end of the plus-or the minus-strand JEV genome were transcribed from PCR products in vitro and used as RNA template. As shown in Fig. 6A , both the plus-strand RNA and the minus-strand RNA were used as templates, but the incorporation of [ 32 P]-UMP was much lower when using positive-strand RNA as template than when using negative-strand RNA -an almost 10-fold difference in efficiency. A similar result was observed when using around 1 kilobase of 3 0 end plus-and minus-strand RNA from the genome of another flavivirus( dengue 2 virus), which gave a difference in yield of about 5-fold.

The mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as described for the parental JEV NS5. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For all proteins, the expression level and purity were comparable to those of the wild type (data not shown). To measure the RdRp activities of all of the mutant NS5 proteins, standard reactions were performed with JEV 3 0 -end 1-kb (\u00c0) RNA as template, and 3 mg of each purified NS5 protein mutant was used for each reaction. Of the 6 mutants in the 4 motifs we produced, 5 substitutions led to complete inactivation of the enzyme. Only one mutant, NS5 mutCn, the Asp-to-Asn substitution at position 669 in Motif C showed a reduction in activity to about 5% relative to the parental NS5 (Fig. 7B ). Revertant mutation of each mutant was performed in the same way, and polymerase activity was recovered in all the revertants (data not shown). These results also confirm that the RNA polymerase activity is due to the wild JEV NS5 protein rather than contaminating proteins derived from bacterial cell lysates.",

As with other enzymes of this class, the RdRp activity of JEV was found to be dependent on divalent ions, Mn 2\u00fe or Mg 2\u00fe . We found that Mn 2\u00fe is much more effective than Mg 2\u00fe in the RdRp reactions, similar to reports for HCV NS5B [8, 16] . Taken together, this would suggest that Mn 2\u00fe is more favoured by flaviviral RdRps. Ca 2\u00fe inhibits polymerase activity. The optimal reaction conditions for in vitro RdRp assay were determined. Like the report for Polio virus RdRp, the optimum reaction temperature is 30 C [10] . A possible reason for a low optimal reaction temperature may be the fact that the rate of UMP incorporation at lower temperature was linear over a longer time period. This in vitro RdRp reaction system would be a good system for studying the viral and host factors involved in viral replication and also for assessing antiviral drugs targeting viral replication. RNA viruses initiate RNA synthesis mainly by two mechanisms: a primer extension mechanism and a de novo initiation mechanism [12, 13] . In this report, RNA synthesis occurred without adding primers; the RdRp products were mainly the same size as the input template when analysed on 8M-ureadenatured PAGE gel, no products twice the size of template were found. Sodium periodate treatment of the template, which blocked the 3 0 end of the template to prevent ''copy-back'' synthesis [1, 27] , does not otherwise change the RdRP reaction products (Fig. 4) , and RNase A treatment did not digest the synthesised RNA under high-salt conditions (Fig. 5 ). All of these results indicates that JEV NS5 RdRp initiate RNA synthesis on RNA templates by a de novo mechanism.",

JEV NS5 protein used the minus-strand RNA to synthesize the plus-strand product much more efficiently than it uses the plus-strand template to synthesize the minus RNA in vitro.

Using linear sequence alignments of JEV NS5 with other RdRps as a basis for site-directed mutagenesis experiments, we also identified four amino acid motifs which appear to play a vital role in the polymerase activity for JEV. Substitutions of almost all these 4 motifs led to a complete inactivation of the enzyme, except for the Asp-to-Asn substitution at position 669 in Motif C, which markedly reduced the activity to about 5% that of parental NS5. This GDN motif was the RdRp motif for some of the negative-strand RNA viruses in the alignment comparison, and this higher tolerance of the second Asp residue of the GDD motif for substitutions has also been reported for other RNA polymerases [17, 18] . These mutatagenesis results also confirm that the RNA polymerase activity is due to the wild JEV NS5 protein rather than contaminating proteins derived from the bacterial cell lysates.",
