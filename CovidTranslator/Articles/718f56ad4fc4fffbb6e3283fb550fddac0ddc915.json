            "text": "The objective of the present study was to determine if chicken melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) senses infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection to initiate and amplify an innate immune response in the chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) signaling pathway. Chicken embryo fibroblast DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV LP1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 or 10. In addition, knockdown and overexpression of chMDA5 were performed by transfecting DF-1 cells with chMDA5targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) or chMDA5expressing DNA. The transfected cells were infected with IBDV LP1 at an MOI of 10. Cell culture supernatants and lysates were collected at 2, 8, 16 and 24 hours postinfection (hpi) for IBDV titer determination and RNA extraction, respectively. IBDV RNA loads and mRNA expression levels of chicken MDA5, interferon-b (IFN-b) promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), IFN-b, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), myxovirus resistance gene (Mx), and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) were determined by real-time RT-PCR. The IBDV titer increased up to 1.4 9 10 7 plaqueforming units (PFU)/mL at 24 hpi, and the IBDV RNA load reached 464 ng/lL at 24 hpi. The mRNA expression levels of chicken MDA5, IRF-3, IFN-b, PKR, OAS, Mx and MHC class I in IBDV-infected DF-1 cells exhibited significant (p \\ 0.05) upregulation up to 906-, 199-, 26,310-, 12-, 66,144-, 64,039-and 33-fold, respectively. Expressed chMDA5 from transfection and double-stranded RNA from IBDV infection were localized or colocalized in the cytoplasm of DF-1 cells at 16 hpi. When chMDA5 was knocked down in DF-1 cells, IBDV titers and RNA loads were significantly higher (p \\ 0.05) than those in DF-1 cells without chMDA5 knockdown at 24 hpi. The expression levels of chicken MDA5, IRF-3, IFN-b and MHC class I in chMDA5-knockdown DF-1 cells were significantly lower (p \\ 0.05) at 16 and 24 hpi. DF-1 cells overexpressing chMDA5 by transfection with chMDA5 expressing DNA had significantly lower (p \\ 0.05) IBDV titers and RNA loads at 16 and 24 hpi and showed significantly higher (p \\ 0.05) expression of chicken MDA5, IRF-3, IFN-b, PKR, OAS, Mx and MHC class I at 2 hpi. The results indicated that chicken MDA5 recognized IBDV infection and that this interaction resulted in the activation of chMDA5-related innate immune genes and upregulation of chicken MHC class I.",

            "text": "Infectious bursal disease (IBD), caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), is an acute, contagious and economically important disease in young chickens. The most obvious lesion is bursal atrophy due to IBDV infecting and destroying B cells in the bursal lymphoid follicles. Chickens infected with IBDV at less than 3 weeks of age usually do not have clinical signs but develop severe immunosuppression, which renders these chickens susceptible to secondary infections and vaccination failures [53] . IBDV is a double-stranded, non-enveloped RNA virus belonging to the family Birnaviridae [30] . The bi-segmented genome comprises segment A (*3.3 kilobase pairs [kbp] ) and segment B (*2.9 kbp). Segment A encodes four viral proteins (VP), designated VP2, VP3, VP4 and VP5, in two partially overlapping open reading frames. The longer open reading frame in segment A encodes a polyprotein that is further processed into mature VP2 and VP3, which are major structural proteins of the virion, and VP4, which functions as a viral protease [11] . The shorter open reading frame in segment A encodes a non-structural protein, VP5, which has been shown to induce apoptosis in chicken B cells and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) to facilitate virus dissemination [39, 54] . Segment B encodes VP1, which is both an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a structural protein that links the ends of two genome segments together [31] .",

When recognizing their ligands, caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD)-containing MDA5 or RIG-I functions together with IFN-b promoter stimulator (IPS-1) via CARD-CARD interaction, leading to the recruitment and activation of both canonical and non-canonical inhibitors of NF-jB kinase (IKK) complexes. The canonical IKK complex mediates the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-jB (I-jB), which is subsequently degraded by proteasomes. The degradation of I-jB allows functional NF-jB to translocate into the cell nucleus, initiating the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines [56] . On the other hand, the non-canonical IKK complex activates the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and IRF-7 to form a functional homodimer or heterodimer. The functional IRF dimers enter the cell nucleus to mediate the transcription of type I IFNs, IFN-a and IFN-b [56] .",

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) is expressed in most nucleated cells and functions to present endogenous antigens to CD8 ? T cells, playing an important role in alerting the immune system [50] . dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) plays a central role in the regulation of protein synthesis in virus-infected cells by catalyzing the phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor-2 (eIF-2), which results in the inhibition of translation [17] . Activation of OAS by dsRNA allows it to synthesize 2 0 ,5 0oligoadenylates from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 2 0 ,5 0oligoadenylates bind to and activate RNase L, which degrades cellular and viral RNA [38] . Mx shows antiviral activity against various RNA viruses by recognizing nucleocapsid-like structures and restricting their localization within the cell [38] . The expression of the human Mx gene has been shown to provide resistance to two dsRNA viruses, including IBDV and a mammalian reovirus [32] . The chicken Mx gene was cloned and shown to confer resistance to influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infections [19] .",

The PRR-PAMP innate and antiviral signaling is critical to the outcome of the infection, but information regarding the recognition of IBDV infection by PRR to induce innate immunity in chickens is limited. Understanding the interaction and underlying mechanism of innate immunity triggered by IBDV infection may shed light on the development of new approaches for protection against IBDV infection. The objective of the present study was to determine if chMDA5 senses IBDV infection, and if this recognition and interaction activates the innate immune response in chicken DF-1 cells, which are non-antigen-presenting cells (APC).",

However, the expression levels of antiviral genes, including PKR, OAS and Mx, in the siRNA groups were not significantly lower (p [ 0.05) than those in the control siRNA groups, suggesting that chMDA5 knockdown did not impact the expression of these genes. Possible explanations are as follows: 1. Some DF-1 cells may not be transfected adequately with chMDA5-targeting siRNA due to the inefficient transfection of DF-1 cells. 2. PKR and OAS are not only IFN-stimulated genes, but also dsRNA sensors [33] . Thus, PKR and OAS may be upregulated by directly sensing dsRNA derived from IBDV infection. 3. Other innate immune sensors may have a role in the activation of these antiviral genes upon IBDV infection, as has been shown in the case of avian influenza virus infection [46] .

Transfection of DF-1 cells with two chMDA5expressing constructs induced similar levels of chMDA5 expression, while MDA5#34 induced significantly more chicken IFN-b transcripts than MDA5#66. This suggests that pCDNA-MDA5#66 DNA is a less potent activator of chicken IFN-b than pCDNA-MDA5#34 in DF-1 cells. Possible explanations for the lower expression of chicken IFN-b by pCDNA-MDA5#66 may include the following: 1. The longer N-terminal segment encoded by pCDNA-MDA5#66 may interfere with the signaling by CARD-CARD interaction. 2. Although chMDA5 mRNA transcripts induced by the two DNA constructs were increased to a similar level, less chMDA5 protein was synthesized in the MDA5#66 group, probably due to a lower translation efficiency, as shown in a previous report [48] .",

ChMDA5 overexpression in DF-1 cells by transfection DF-1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a concentration of 1.5 9 10 5 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection was aided by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). One microliter of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was diluted in 50 lL of Opti-MEM \u00d2 (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Plasmid DNA (0.4 lg) was diluted in 50 lL Opti-MEM \u00d2 . Two chMDA5-expressing DNA constructs were used: pCDNA-MDA5#66 and pCDNA-MDA5#34 [23]. The insert in pCDNA-MDA5#66 was 101 amino acids longer than that in pCDNA-MDA5#34 at the amino terminus, encoding a longer chMDA5 from an alternative translation initiation site [23]. The diluted Lipofectamine 2000 and plasmid DNA were mixed together and incubated at room temperature for 20 min.
