Service providers admitted selective adherence and non-adherence to universal precautions in their daily medical practice, and gave their explanations for such behaviors. Lack of time to put on protective gear, gear's interference with medical procedures, lack of administrative support, heavy workload in hospitals, inaccurate risk assessment, and beliefs that compliance with universal precautions is unnecessary, time consuming and costly were mentioned as reasons behind noncompliance.

Since the first AIDS case in China was identified in 1985, the number of annual reported HIV infections in China increased steadily at an average rate of 30% every year between 1995 and 2000 (China Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2004; Wu, Rou, & Cui, 2004) . By the end of 2005, there were an estimated 650,000 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in China, and of them, 75,000 had developed AIDS. AIDS has surpassed hepatitis B to become the 3rd deadliest infectious disease in China (China Ministry of Health, Joint United Nations Program on HIV/ AIDS, & World Health Organization, 2006) . With increased demand for HIV testing, counseling, diagnosis and treatment, the rapid spread of HIV infection has become a major challenge for service providers in China, who are at increased risk for occupational exposure to blood and bodily fluids. In developing nations, excessive handling of contaminated needles, high patient demand for injections, and lack of safe needle and sharp containers enhance the risk of occupational transmission of bloodborne pathogens (BBP; Sagoe-Moses, Pearson, Perry, & Jagger, 2001) . The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 2.5% of HIV cases and 40% of hepatitis B and C cases among health service providers worldwide are the result of working with related exposure (WHO, 2002) .",

Theme Group on HIV/AIDS in China 2004; U.S. Embassy, 2000) , and is one of China's less developed provinces, with more poverty-stricken counties than any other province. The recruitment procedures were built upon experience gained from previous and ongoing projects in the area. Research staff first sought administrative support from the Bureaus of Health at each of the three main study sites and Departments of Health at the subsequent study counties. Before the recruitment started, hospital information, such as number of beds, number of staff, reported HIV cases per hospital, and HIV screening test capability were gathered. From each level (provincial, city, county, township, and village), health care facilities with the highest number of reported HIV cases were selected. Convenience sampling was used and recommendations for interview participants were obtained from the head of each health care facility in order to include doctors and nurses from different departments who were relatively better informed. Using standardized recruitment scripts, staff approached the recommended individual health service providers and administrators. All participants joined the study voluntarily and the study only used materials and activities approved by both the UCLA and China CDC Institutional Review Boards. A Community Advisory Board (CAB) was formed to provide consultation on cultural appropriateness, applicability of the study design for the population, and administration. The CAB was composed of officials from the provincial Health Bureau, health providers from the Department of Infectious Diseases of provincial hospitals, administrators from the local CDC, PLWHA, and their family members. Before interviews were conducted, revisions were made to the guides according to suggestions provided by CAB.",

During the interviews, service provider participants were asked openended questions about knowledge and personal practice of universal precautions, HIV knowledge, attitudes, and perceived risk of infection at work. Health administrators were asked about knowledge of universal precaution practice, monitoring of universal precaution compliance, and general regulations and policies, and policies in the specific health care facility or the region that their agency covered.

These findings are similar to those reported by studies conducted in India and China (Kermode et al. 2005; Ji et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2003 ). On the one hand, providers do not wear protective gears when in contact with blood and bodily fluid. On the other hand, many providers expressed deep and irrational fears about HIV/AIDS, and thought the hospital and government should provide excessive protective gears for treating AIDS patients. Many mentioned that the same gears used for treating SARS, a respiratory infectious disease, should be used for treating AIDS. Many providers practiced selective \"universal\" precautions, and mostly only when seeing PLWHA patients, which has resulted in unfair labeling of PLWHA and greater unfounded fear toward HIV/AIDS. In reality, providers do not make correct judgments about which patients are HIV-positive (Wenrich, Carline, Curtis, Paauw, & Ramsey, 1996) . Providers' lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS and false impression about personal safety, in combination with the high prevalence of many other infectious diseases in China, such as hepatitis B, are putting providers at high risk of occupational exposure to all infectious diseases when they practice universal precautions selectively.",

In addition, our data reveal that the primary reasons for noncompliance with universal precautions in health care facilities in China are lack of training, and lack of legal and management responsibility at the administrative level. Many of the existing Chinese hospital policies work against safe practice, such as directing nurses to remove needles from syringes after giving an injection or taking blood. Our data show that many administrators, both hospital administrators and administrators working at local government health agencies, believed that implementation of universal precautions is the sole responsibility of the providers. It is impossible, however, for the providers to comply with universal precautions in their daily practice when they do not have access to universal precaution supplies, opportunities to attend trainings, or effective regular oversight of compliance. In addition, many of the hospital administrators had incorrect beliefs about safe practices (e.g., supporting the bending of used needles). Effective interventions on universal precautions in China need to address structural barriers and to educate both providers and administrators.",

Our data suggest that having a national Guideline alone does not guarantee compliance by either hospital administrators or service providers. Studies have shown that training of providers on universal precaution knowledge is an important way to improve compliance (Diekema, Schuldt, Albanese, & Doebbeling, 1995; Sokas, Simmens, & Scott, 1993; Williams, Campbell, Henry, & Collier, 1994) . There is an urgent need for training on universal precautions for service providers in China.",

Studies (Gruber et al. 1989; Turner, 1993; Van Wissen & Siebers 1993) have shown that successfully addressing psychosocial and motivational aspects of service providers' non-compliance is an important step in changing behaviors and increasing compliance with universal precautions. Providers will begin to take universal precautions seriously when they are given the necessary support. Many provider participants expressed frustration about the lack of support from their hospital for universal precautions, but the majority of providers did not fully comply with universal precautions even when given the opportunity. Interventions need to address individual providers' attitudes and emphasize that universal precautions are standard practice and not just for a special group of patients. Furthermore, the updated national Guideline has important advice about safe practices, but places too much emphasis on HIV/AIDS and not enough on universal precautions. This gives providers a false sense of security when they practice selective adherence to universal precautions and singles HIV out when there are many other infectious diseases to which providers might be occupationally exposed. The national Guideline should be revised to emphasize that precautions should be universal for all infectious diseases, and focus on compliance with using correct procedures with all patients. A better solution, as mentioned above, would be to pass a national law mandating the use of universal precautions and responsibility for providing adequate supplies for universal precautions, and to address this fundamental problem in the current health care delivery system.",

Since the national guidelines on universal precautions focus on preventing infection from PLWHA, it is likely that our participants are better prepared and informed compared to their peers at other locations in China. Also, the study did not collect direct observational data on universal precaution practice among providers, but relied on self-report. This may result in underreporting of non-compliance with universal precautions. As a qualitative study, the sample is not representative of all service providers, limiting the generalizability of the results. All of these study limitations cause the results to lean toward reporting better compliance with universal precautions by providers. Major non-compliance by providers, however, was still evident, and the underlying causes still apply to most health care settings in China. The findings are important for designing future HIV interventions.",
