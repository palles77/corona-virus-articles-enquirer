The structures induced by enteroviruses, which are members of the family Picornaviridae, have so far been described as either single-or double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). Aside from the number of delimiting membranes, their exact architecture has also remained elusive due to the limitations of conventional electron microscopy. In this study, we used electron tomography (ET) to solve the three-dimensional (3-D) ultrastructure of these compartments. At different time points postinfection, coxsackievirus B3-infected cells were high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted for ET analysis. The tomograms showed that during the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis, closed smooth single-membrane tubules constituted the predominant virus-induced membrane structure, with a minor proportion of DMVs that were either closed or connected to the cytosol in a vase-like configuration. As infection progressed, the DMV number steadily increased, while the tubular single-membrane structures gradually disappeared. Late in infection, complex multilamellar structures, previously unreported, became apparent in the cytoplasm. Serial tomography disclosed that their basic unit is a DMV, which is enwrapped by one or multiple cisternae.",

The ultrastructural characterization of these \"replication structures\" is key to understanding their precise role. Here, we resolved the three-dimensional architecture of enterovirus-induced membranous compartments and their transformation in time by applying electron tomography to cells infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Our results show that closed single-membrane tubules are the predominant initial virus-induced structure, whereas double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) become increasingly abundant at the expense of these tubules as infection progresses. Additionally, more complex multilamellar structures appear late in infection. Based on compelling intermediate structures in our tomograms, we propose a model for transformation from the tubules to DMVs and multilamellar structures via enwrapping events. Our work provides an in-depth analysis of the development of an unsuspected variety of distinct replication structures during the course of CVB3 infection.",

The fact that, depending on the particular EM study, they were visualized as either single-or double-membrane structures is particularly intriguing. Furthermore, the technical approach has thus far been limited to conventional two-dimensional (2-D) EM. Electron tomography (ET) (24) allows a detailed three-dimensional (3-D) analysis of viral replication structures, as illustrated by recent studies for other positive-strand RNA viruses (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . These works revealed new structural details (e.g., connections and openings) that have important mechanistic implications for the overall organization of the replicative cycle. In this study, we set out to investigate the membrane structures induced by the enterovirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) at different stages of infection, using a combination of advanced cryofixation methods and serial ET. Our results document a variety of CVB3-induced structures that appear at different time points after infection, reveal their detailed 3-D architecture, and provide the basis for a model in which early single-membrane structures are transformed into late DMVs and multilamellar structures.",

However, a thorough analysis of the tomograms revealed that the majority of the tubules (around 75%) constituted individual, unconnected entities, and no more than two tubules ever appeared to be interconnected. It should be noted, though, that this analysis is limited by the anisotropic resolution that is typical of ET, since connections perpendicular to the third dimension cannot be resolved (24) .

Whereas pairing of the tubular walls by interaction of the inner surfaces would help to flatten a tubule, membrane curvature needs to be induced to produce the round DMV shape. These predicted intermediate structures, which would be better described as cisternae, were indeed present in our tomograms (Fig. 5B to D) . The combined effect of curvature and pairing would eventually result in a rounded-up cisterna enwrapping cytoplasmic space. In this stage, the curved cisternae would be indistinguishable from an open DMV in a vase-like configuration (Fig. 5E) . Fusion of the membrane ends would then account for the transition into a closed DMV with tightly apposed membranes (Fig. 5F ). This enwrapping mechanism can also explain the formation of other structures apparent in our tomograms, such as tubules engulfed by open DMVs or by layered cisternae (see Movie S4). Likewise, the multilamellar structures typical of the late infection stage could just be the result of an analogous enwrapping process of DMVs by cisternae and, therefore, would also be ultimately derived from the original tubular structures.",

This newly discovered time dependency provides an explanation for the discrepancies between previous reports on enterovirus replication structures. Single-membrane tubular clusters occur predominantly early in infection ( Fig. 2A, 2A=, and 3) , whereas the number of DMVs increases as infection progresses (Fig. 2B, 2B= , and 4). Importantly, similar observations have been made recently in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells in an independent study (G. A. Belov, V. Nair, B. T. Hansen, F. H. Hoyt, E. R. Fischer, and E. Ehrenfeld, submitted for publication), which suggests that this phenomenon is general for enteroviruses and independent of the specific cell line. In addition to these compartments, we detected a third type of modification, the multilamellar structures ( Fig. 2C and C=), which are typical of the late phase of infection.

Proteins of the entire secretory pathway as well as autophagy markers have been detected in enterovirus replication structures (10, 11, 18, 19, 32) , suggesting that several cellular pathways may be involved in their generation. In light of our results, it is tempting to speculate that the different pathways may play a role during different stages of infection as the replication structures evolve. An in-depth immuno-EM study of host and viral markers (including viral RNA) at different time points, which is beyond the scope of this work, will be necessary to elucidate this.",

            "text": "A limited number of membrane-remodeling mechanisms-in particular, curvature, fusion, and membrane-membrane interactions-would thus be required to produce the variety of morphologies of CVB3 replication structures observed. In the overall process, the enteroviral 2BC and 3A proteins must be key players, since their coexpression generates membrane structures that mimic those observed during viral infection (20) . Importantly, 2B and 2C both contain an amphipathic \u2423-helix (33-35), a wellknown curvature-inducing motif (3) . Also, recruited host factors may well play a role in membrane remodeling (18, 19, 36) . Elucidating the mechanistic details of the formation and transformation of enterovirus replication structures will be one of the challenges for future investigations. In any case, the mechanisms must be essentially different from those that generate the replication structures of nodaviruses, togaviruses, and flaviviruses. Rather than protrusions, the latter are invaginations into mitochondrial, endo/lysosomal, and ER membranes, respectively, with a necklike connection to the cytosol (25, (27) (28) (29) . From this point of view, the replication structures of enteroviruses are more similar to those of nidoviruses, which have also been reported to generate DMVs in infected cells (31, 37, 38) . However, in light of our results, important topological differences between the two groups are apparent, since CVB3-induced DMVs are isolated compartments, whereas our previous 3-D studies on nidoviruses established that, in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and equine arterivirus, the DMVs are actually interconnected, forming a large reticulovesicular network continuous with the ER (26, 39) .",

In comparison, the scenario for enteroviruses looks conceptually simpler, since the replication complex has been reported to be situated on the cytosolic face of the membranous structures (7, 40) , consistent with the membrane topography of the nonstructural proteins thought to assemble into the replication complex (41) (42) (43) . We show here that the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis occurs relatively early, coinciding with the predominance of single-membrane tubules, strongly suggesting that these are the essential structures supporting viral RNA synthesis. Accordingly, pulse-labeling and autoradiography experiments performed early in infection pinpointed the active replication complex to the outer surface of single-membrane structures (7) . Nevertheless, since DMVs appear to be derived from the tubular structures, it seems plausible that they could also support viral RNA synthesis.",

When the multilamellar structures emerge, the replicative cycle of the virus is almost complete: progeny virions have already been produced, and the cell is going into demise. Notwithstanding the fascinating complexity of these structures, they could well be the by-product of the membrane-remodeling activities operating during the initial phases. As for the unwrapped DMVs, the reasons for their formation remain mysterious. The DMVs induced by poliovirus were postulated to mediate nonlytic release of progeny virus particles (44) . Although this process would account for only a minor fraction of the total progeny viruses released after cell lysis, it might promote viral spread within the infected host.",

Fusion of the ends of an open DMV could then give rise to a closed DMV (F). All the panels are 5-nm-thick slices separated by an interval of 15 nm in their respective tomograms; thereby, the encompassed z height is identical for all rows. Scale bars, 100 nm.",

The single membrane tubules present early in infection transform into double-and multiple-membrane structures as CVB3 infection proceeds. The membranes of the tubules become more tightly apposed, resulting in flattened cisternae. Via an enwrapping mechanism, the cisterna curves into a vase-like configuration, and its membrane ends fuse, producing a closed, spherical DMV. The DMVs then become enwrapped by other cisternae.",
