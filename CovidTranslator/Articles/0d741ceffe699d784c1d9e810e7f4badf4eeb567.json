In the past few decades, data from high-throughput technologies have allowed for the rapid development of new antiviral therapeutic strategies, thus making a profound impact on translational research. Most of the current preclinical studies in virology are aimed at evaluating the dynamic composition and localization of the protein platforms involved in various host-virus interactions. Among the different possible approaches, mass spectrometry-based proteomics is increasingly being used to define the protein composition in subcellular compartments, quantify differential protein expression among samples, characterize protein complexes, and analyse protein post-translational modifications. Here, we review the current knowledge of the most useful proteomic approaches in the study of viral persistence and pathogenicity, with a particular focus on recent advances in hepatitis C research.",

'Omics' technologies such as genomics and transcriptomics have greatly enhanced the systemic evaluation of gene expression. Despite their usefulness, genomics and transcriptomics approaches have certain limitations. First, gene mutations and mRNA expression levels determined quantitatively often do not mirror the real situation in terms of mature proteins. Moreover, translational and post-translational regulation affect not only the level of a mature protein but also its function. In fact, the effects on protein structure and biological function of alternative splicing, post-translational modifications and virus-host interactions cannot be easily predicted by genomics and transcriptomics studies. In light of this, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is a unique and necessary tool for system-wide, structural and functional analysis of the effectors of biological functions.",

Proper separation of these mixtures is essential for the accurate identification and quantification of proteins by MS.

In the past few years, this technique has been complemented by a quantitative application (two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE)) that allows for analysis of the relative changes in protein abundance among different samples [3] . However, owing to recent technical advances, high-resolution nanoliquid chromatography is gradually replacing both 2-DE and DIGE. This is because the low volume and low flow rate of nano-liquid chromatography allows for analysis of proteins on an attomole level, significantly reducing solvent waste and enhancing MS-based protein identification [4] .",
