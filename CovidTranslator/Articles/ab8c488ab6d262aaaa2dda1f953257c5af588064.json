On March 12, there were a total number of 234,998 tests where 209,402 patients were tested negative. 7,869 patients were tested negative as of March 12, 2020 of which 66 patients died. Over 53 days, on average, 3867 patients were tested for the virus of which 3133 patients were tested negative and 138 patients were tested positive each day. Since early February, there has been an exponential increase in the number of tested cases where most of them were tested negative. Out of 67 patients that were confirmed positive in South Korea as of February 19, 2020, the geographical data of 56 them are available, which allows a visualization of their route patterns. Figure 2 depicts the spatial the two large clusters of COVID-19 as of February 19th, 2020.

The numeric node numbers indicate unique patient identifiers and nth COVID-19 confirmed cases in South Korea. The first case (the 3rd case in the nation) in the capital cluster was diagnosed positive on January 26, 2020. This patient had physical contact with 16 different individuals, travelled from Wuhan, China, and transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to the 6th and 28th confirmed cases in Korea. These two cases have further resulted in subsequential (i.e., secondary) positive cases in the capital area. In this graph, the 6th case made physical contact with 17 different individuals and resulted in four new cases. The 6th case is unlikely to be a super-spreader given a low number of physical other individuals before being treated. Although this cluster represents the largest connected component from the entire visualized infection network, it is reported that no further cases have been added in this cluster since February 21, 2020.The transmission network of the capital area cluster composed of 15 different nodes The epicenter of the South Korean COVID-19 outbreak has been identified in Daegu, associated with the Shin-Cheonji Church of Jesus. In this cluster, the first confirmed case-the 31st patient in the cluster-was confirmed positive on February 18, 2020. This person had physical contact with an estimated number of 1,160 individuals in different places such as Shin-Cheonji Church of Jesus and the hospital in Cheong-do.Figure 4clearly demonstrates how the first patient in this cluster infected eight individuals. This epicenter has been attributed as one of the major events led to at least 40 secondary cases in the city of Daegu and almost a half of the country's confirmed cases were linked to this cluster in late February.8 However, secondary infection information was not available in the dataset, which does not allow visualization of a bigger network. Regardless, the Daegu network shows what is known as a super-spreader who contacted 1,160 different patients and started the transmission cluster in Daegu.",

Therefore, visualization of these clusters may be helpful to understand the transmission in addition to epidemiological measures like the reproduction number. A recent paper estimated the reproduction number and the outbreak size of the COVID-19 in South Korea using the deterministic mathematical model. The estimated 0 in the national level was 0.55 while the estimate in Daegu was between 3.47 -3.54.10 Another estimate of 0 in South Korea was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4 -1.6), calculated using the generalized growth model.9 These estimates are dynamic, and global estimates of the reproduction numbers may not be easily interpretable for different region-and group-specific transmission clusters. There are also a number of different mathematical models that can be used to calculate the reproduction number under different",
