Allergic reactions consist of early phase and late phase reactions. 5 Early phase reactions involve the mediation of IgE-allergen complexes and produce the typical symptoms of allergic rhinitis. 5 Late phase reactions involve activation and sequestration of inflammatory cells that produce vascular congestion and nasal hyperresponsiveness. 5 Inflammatory cells that migrate into the nasal mucosa include eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, T cells, and neutrophils. 5 The resultant inflammation causes the normal nasal response to become exaggerated. 5 Because of the nasal hyperresponsiveness, some individuals with allergic rhinitis can experience allergic symptoms on exposure to nonallergic stimuli (such as perfumes, smoke, strong odors, or other irritants). 5 Eosinophils play a major role in nasal hyperresponsiveness. 5 Eosinophils arrive after allergen exposure and produce IL-5. IL-5 promotes activation and survival of other eosinophils. 5 Eosinophils also release toxic products that damage local mucosal cells. 5 Prevention Identifying the environmental allergens or irritants that trigger rhinitis symptoms can be important in the management of the disease process. 4 Mild disease can usually be managed with avoidance measures alone. 1 Allergen removal can also improve the severity of allergic rhinitis and can reduce the need for medications. 1 Pollen, dust mites, animals, insect proteins, and fungi are the most prominent allergic triggers. 4 Environmental control may take weeks to months to produce full beneficial effects, and complete avoidance of allergen is usually not feasible or practical. 1 Reduction of dust mite allergen exposure can be accomplished in the following ways: remove carpets and soft toys, use covers impermeable to allergens for mattresses and pillows, vacuum beds weekly, and wash bedding at 60 C (140 F). 1 Pet dander avoidance can only be effectively managed by removing the pet and carefully cleaning all carpets, furniture, and mattresses. 1 Implementation of avoidance measures is largely based on consensus panel recommendations because of the lack of high-quality evidence. 6, 7 As with any treatment regimen or avoidance strategy, subpopulations of patients may respond differently to the same treatment plan. 8 A patient's treatment plan requires individualization based on factors such as age, symptom severity, seasonality, route of medication administration preference (ie, nasal vs oral), medication side effects, cost, onset of action, and benefit to comorbid conditions. 8 Avoidance is the first-line treatment of any form of rhinitis.

Nasal pruritus, palatal pruritus, sneezing, allergen exposure, seasonality, and associated ocular symptoms suggest allergic disease. 3, 8 A family history of allergy is also an important clue that symptoms might be allergy related. 9 Treatment Oral antihistamines should be used to treat patients with mild or occasional seasonal allergic rhinitis. Cromolyn is an alternative to oral antihistamines in mild disease. 1 Intranasal corticosteroids are effective in treating seasonal allergic rhinitis of moderate or long duration. If the patient's seasonal allergic rhinitis is severe, an oral antihistamine can be added to the intranasal corticosteroid. Other considerations for severe seasonal allergic rhinitis include adding oral decongestants, ipratropium bromide, or analgesics. As a last resort, immunotherapy should be considered for those who fail other therapies. 1 Primary treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis is avoidance. Oral or intranasal antihistamines are effective for mild or intermittent symptoms not controlled with avoidance. Moderate or frequent symptoms should be treated with intranasal corticosteroids. Adding an oral antihistamine can be done if corticosteroids alone are not effective. 1 Severe symptoms usually require additional therapies such as topical or oral decongestants for congestion and ipratropium bromide for rhinorrhea. Immunotherapy can be considered, but is not as effective in treating perennial allergic rhinitis as it is in treating seasonal allergic rhinitis. 1 As a last resort, surgical reduction of turbinate hypertrophy is an option.",

Rhinomanometry can be useful in assessing the severity of an anatomic abnormality and assessing those patients with obstructive sleep apnea. 4 A sleep study should be considered in patients presenting with chronic rhinitis, because chronic rhinitis is a risk factor for sleep disordered breathing. 4 Computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging are expensive but can be used to identify anatomic abnormalities using coronal sections.

Blockade of the muscarinic receptors causes dry mucous membranes, blurry vision, constipation, tachycardia, and urinary retention. 3 Because first-generation antihistamines cross the blood-brain barrier, significant sedation occurs. 3 The sedative effects of these antihistamines have been linked to industrial accidents and contribute to significant loss of function at work and school. 3 Overall, first-generation antihistamines are limited in usefulness because of these sedative and anticholinergic effects. 3 Second-generation antihistamines have better selectivity for the H-1 receptor. 3 A more complex molecular structure allows second-generation antihistamines to not cross the blood-brain barrier. These antihistamines are considered nonsedating. 9 The risk/benefit ratio of second-generation antihistamines is so favorable that they are considered first-line therapy for mild allergic rhinitis.

By starting at low doses of the injected allergen and by progressively increasing the dose, SCIT builds up immunity to the offending allergen. 11 SCIT is indicated for adults and children presenting with pollen-induced and dust mite-induced allergic rhinitis, and in those patients for whom medications and avoidance measures are inadequate. 11 SCIT is the only treatment that has proved to alter the course of allergic disease. 9 Evidence suggests that immunotherapy can halt the advancement of allergic disease that causes asthma and that it halts the creation of new sensitivities. 11 Children, patients early in the disease process, and patients with few sensitivities are the most likely to benefit from SCIT. 11 SCIT starts with a buildup phase, which entails increasing the injected allergen dose over time. When the maximum dose of allergen extract is reached, the maintenance phase begins. 1 The maximum dose of allergen in the injections is variable among the different allergen extracts. For example, the maximum dose of dust mite allergen is 7 mg. 11 The usual recommendation is that maintenance treatment should last for 3 years. 11 After an average of 3 to 4 years of maintenance immunotherapy, the effectiveness of treatment lasts for 3 years or more after discontinuation. 11 The inherent risk of SCIT is systemic anaphylaxis. 1, 11 The rate of significant systemic reactions in patients with allergic rhinitis is approximately 5%. 1 Times of the year with increased pollen count can predispose to severe and life-threatening systemic reactions to SCIT. 11 Patients must wait 20 to 30 minutes after SCIT treatment to monitor for severe reactions. 11 Pretreatment with antihistamines has the potential to reduce systemic reactions. 11 ",
