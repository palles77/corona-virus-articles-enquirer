Recently, an Australian study has shown that Enterococci faecium, the microorganism responsible for various nosocomial infections, was behind over 30% of enterococcal bacteremia cases surveyed in the country [4] . It was found that 90% of these were ampicillin-resistant CC17 strains, while 50% were also vancomycin-resistant. Other evidence suggests that some E. faecium strains may be expressing limited resistance to alcohol-based sanitisers, although at concentrations significantly lower than is recommended for use in hospital settings [5] . The continuing spread of antibiotic resistance is an area of significant concern and necessitates the careful consideration of more rigorous management practices, as well as the assessment of alternative antiseptics for broad hygiene applications.",

It is usually applied to the skin as a liquid or a powder and can be used to treat current infections and prevent the spread of opportunistic pathogens. PVP-I has a broad antimicrobial spectrum and is active against a plethora of viruses and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains (Table 1) . Susceptible Gram-negative bacteria include Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common pathogen in hospitals, and susceptible Grampositive bacteria include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In addition, PVP-I has been shown to be superior to chlorhexidine in hand washing studies comparing efficacy against bacteria and viruses ( Table 2) .",

PVP-I is available over the counter and is often used as a broad-spectrum topical antiseptic treatment for minor cuts, burns, and abrasions, as well as in surgical operating theatres. Widespread use in diverse clinical and non-clinical settings over recent decades has made the numerous advantages of PVP-I formulations more apparent. In addition to a broad-spectrum effect and excellent safety profile, active iodine has various properties that can aid in wound healing, with a strong evidencebased rationale existing for the application of PVP-I in treating infected wounds. The European Wound Management Association has published a position paper that acknowledges the broad spectrum of PVP-I activity against bacteria, viruses, fungi and endospores [6] . In contrast to other antiseptics, significant resistance or cross-resistance has not been observed for iodine, likely due to the various mechanisms through which iodine elicits its effects. It has thus found diverse applications in healthcare as a sterilising agent for pre-and post-operative Table 1 Comparison of antimicrobial activities of common antiseptic classes [12, 13] Preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy data show that PVP-I exhibits characteristics that are well-suited to wound-healing scenarios, including efficacy against biofilms, good tolerability and some degree of anti-inflammatory effect [7, 8] . Of clinical relevance, healing in clean wounds is not suppressed by PVP-I, while it is supported in wounds that are colonised by microorganisms. It is particularly useful for the treatment of sensitive wounds and those where an extended duration of therapy is needed. Medicated gauzes are now widely available, making the formulations easier to apply [9] .",

The iodine molecules are free to oxidise vital pathogen structures such as amino acids, nucleic acids and membrane components. An equilibrium is achieved in such circumstances, with more PVP-bound iodine released into solution to replace the iodine that is consumed by germicidal activity. The maintenance of this equilibrium ensures long-lasting efficacy during bouts of microorganism proliferation, as well as better tolerability for patients due to lower levels of irritation. Electron microscopy and biochemical observations support the hypothesis that PVP-I disrupts microbial cell walls by inducing pore formation, leading to cytosol leakage [17] . The lack of reported resistance to PVP-I to date is thought to be due to the sheer diversity of susceptible targets within each pathogen, an important aspect to be considered in the face of rising concerns for antibiotic resistance.

            "text": "The emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, including VRE and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has become a significant issue for healthcare facilities throughout the world. Indeed, studies have shown that approximately 42% of S. aureus isolates in Europe and Japan harbour genes that enable resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds and chlorhexidine, with chlorhexidine overuse thought to be a factor in emerging resistance in some strains of Gram-negative bacteria [18, 19] . The prevalence of methicillin resistance harboured by strains of S. aureus capable of causing bloodstream infection between 1990 and the early 2000s in the UK rose significantly from 2 to [ 40%, with mean overall rates of bacteraemia involving MRSA ranging from 0.10 to 0.19 per 1000 occupied beds [7] . The overuse of antibiotics is thought to be a contributing factor towards rising antibiotic resistance, and is now being discouraged in favour of the wider usage of antiseptics, to which it is more difficult for bacteria to develop resistance [7] . While evidence of cross-resistance to antiseptics and antibiotics has been documented for many agents, in over a century of use, no significant acquired resistance or crossresistance has been reported for iodine when used for specific indications [20] . This striking lack of resistance is thought to be due to the diverse mechanisms through which iodine simultaneously exerts its effects. Although some aspects remain to be fully understood, iodine's microbicidal activity is known to involve the oxidation of bacterial cell components, including amino/fatty acids, nucleotides, lipids in the cell membrane, and enzymes in the cytosol, ultimately promoting their denaturation and deactivation [16] . More specifically, the multimodal action of iodine is known to arise from the potent oxidation of NH-, OH-, and SHgroups on amino acids, nucleotides and unsaturated fatty acids, and the emergence of resistance is likely to be prevented by the sheer diversity of targets affected. Such effects eventually result in the simultaneous inactivation of bacterial enzymes, a loss of genome integrity, and cell wall damage, overwhelming the microorganism's repair mechanisms.",

The investigators found that, after 20 passages, no detectable change was observed in the minimal inhibitory concentration of iodine needed, nor the time taken until cell death occurred between the parent strain and the passaged subcultures when exposed to efficacious concentrations of iodine. The PVP-I formulation containing up to 1% available iodine was able to kill all strains tested in under 5 min, with most cells being destroyed within 30 s. While dilute concentrations were noted to take in excess of 10 min to achieve an effect, even these iodine dilutions were successful in killing all strains upon prolonged exposure. In real-world scenarios, over-the-counter PVP-I formulations are accommodating of such prolonged exposure to healthy skin, with some commercial formulations known to be active for 12-14 h, compared to the 1-4 h of activity documented for chlorhexidine against fungi and endospores. Of particular note, clinical isolates of chlorhexidine-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae that are also cross-resistant to colistin have recently been identified [22] . While chlorhexidine is commonly used in disinfectants, these new findings suggest that exposure to chlorhexidine is associated with stable resistance to colistin, an antibiotic of last resort for multidrug-resistant infections.",

The European Committee of Standardization (CEN) recommends that the first phase involve an in vitro suspension test with enveloped viruses (representing the bulk of emerging infectious disease threats). Phase 2 involves similar conditions, but with non-enveloped viruses, while the third and final phase involves human hands in a simulation study. In addition to a virucidal hand test, variations on the latter step can include a quantitative non-porous surface test without mechanical action, a quantitative carrier test, and a so-called 4-field test involving surface disinfection with mechanical action (Fig. 1) . Similarly, the US Center for Disease Control recommends a standardised method simulating hand washing with the antiseptic formula to be tested to determine efficacy in reducing hand microflora [23] . New test models have enabled the assessment of PVP-I formulations against highly infective and dangerous pathogens that may not be possible to test in vivo due to clinical risks and ethical considerations. EN 14476 is a standardised inactivation assay that involves a virus suspension, an interfering substance (such as bovine serum albumin), and the substance to be tested [24] . A virus control mixture is used to compare the effects of the antiviral product following a specified contact time (e.g. 15, 30 or 60 s), with virucidal activity calculated by determining the difference in logarithmic titre between the virus control and the test virus cultures.",

Due to its high biosecurity level, research into vaccines and containment measures for the virus was highly limited.

Such models allow for reasonable progress to be made in comparing antiviral agents in certain settings. Similarly, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was first discovered in 2012, with the virus now having infected more than 1300 victims in 26 countries, resulting in more than 480 deaths. Transmission is known to frequently occur in healthcare settings, highlighting the need for suitable models to test containment measures. The modified vaccinia virus, Ankara, has been used as a test model for MERS, with similar structural features and cultivation measures [24] .",

To date, the virus remains categorised as a high biosafety risk, with containment remaining the primary measure to combat outbreaks, as no vaccines or specific antiviral treatments have yet been developed.

Mumps and adeno-viruses have been decimated in test settings by a more than 3-log reduction within 60 s of exposure to PVP-I concentrations higher than 0.5% [27] . Influenza virus was inactivated by a more than 5-log reduction following 15 s at the same dose levels, while HIV was reduced by a more than 4.5-log reduction after a 30-s exposure to doses higher than 0.05%. However, coxsackievirus and poliovirus type 1 were observed to be not as sensitive to PVP-I inactivation, with both viruses requiring doses higher than 0.125% for inactivation, as was the case for rhinovirus. The authors concluded that PVP-I preparations were effective against measles, mumps, herpes, HIV, influenza, and rota-viruses, while rubella, polio-, adeno-, and rhinoviruses were only sensitive to higher doses. The fact that both virus types could be either sensitive or resistant regardless of whether they were enveloped or non-enveloped suggests that mechanisms specific to certain viral types are likely to some extent to influence iodine sensitivity.

Indeed, postoperative infection rates are lower when procedures include a sterilisation step with PVP-I [29] . Patients undergoing gastrointestinal procedures are at a higher risk of postoperative wound infection due to the difficulty in removing enteric bacteria present in the gut.

In an interesting recent study, researchers used a UV-based sterilisation approach incorporating single-wavelength far-UVC light generated by filtered excilamps, which was found to kill pathogenic microorganisms [32] . Importantly, the wavelengths used cannot penetrate human skin or eye tissue, and are not powerful enough to cause biological damage to mammalian cells. Due to the considerably smaller scales at which microbial structures exist, the 222-nm far-UVC light was highly effective in inactivating the H1N1 strain of influenza A virus. The viral particles were suspended in aerosolised droplets, simulating those generated by human coughing and breathing. In addition to its affordability as an antiseptic approach, one major advantage of UVC light is that it is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes. Like PVP-I, this broad spectrum of effect is particularly important considering the multidrug-resistant variants of bacteria emerging in such settings.",

The guidelines recommend formulations containing 7.5% iodine for use as a surgical hand scrub. Lower concentrations (0.05%) have good antimicrobial activity due to the concentrations of free iodine increasing to some extent as the solution is diluted [37] . Thorough hand antisepsis, which can be achieved by hand washing or surgical scrubs with antimicrobial agents, is recommended in surgical settings before the performance of invasive procedures such as the placement of intravascular catheters, or in any scenario where it is deemed necessary to reduce numbers of resident skin flora and transient microorganisms on the skin.",

In cases where E. faecium has been confirmed, the extent to which hand disinfectants are used in the context of other available active substances should be considered. The disinfectants listed by the Disinfectants Commission of the Association for Applied Hygiene (VAH) also mentions products with various other active ingredients including n-propanols, peroxides, and iodine products. Combinations with quaternary compounds, phenol derivatives, guanidine derivatives or iodine-cleaving compounds can also be considered. For surface disinfection, approaches that rely solely on alcohol disinfection should be avoided and replaced with combination approaches with alcohol and other active substances. For final disinfection of patient rooms where E. faecium may be present, per compound-based preparations can be used.",

PVP-I showed the highest bactericidal rate against all test strains observed within 30 s of exposure. Middle school students were trained and encouraged to use the gargles, with comparisons of absenteeism made between the schools that encouraged the practice and those that did not. In the middle school using the PVP-I gargle, absenteeism due to the common cold and influenza were significantly lower compared to the schools using the other two agents.
