Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R 0 ] of 1\u20225, 2\u20220, or 2\u20225) and assuming 7\u00b75% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R 0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22\u00b77%, 30\u00b70%, 40\u00b70%, and 50\u00b70%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.",

The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000-776 000) when R 0 was 2\u00b70, corresponding to 19\u20223% (17\u20228-20\u20226) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000-1 249 000) when R 0 was 2\u00b75, corresponding to 32% (30\u20229-33\u20221) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99\u20223% (IQR 92\u20226-99\u20229) when R 0 was 1\u00b75, by 93\u00b70% (81\u20225-99\u20227) when R 0 was 2\u00b70, and by 78\u20222% (59\u00b70 -94\u20224) when R 0 was 2\u00b75. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50\u00b70%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R 0 of 1\u00b75.",

We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.",

            "text": "In December, 2019, several health facilities in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) reported clusters of individuals with pneumonia 1 whose clinical presentations resembled the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2002 in the nearby Guangdong province and led to outbreaks worldwide. 2 On Jan 7, 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was isolated, confirming the circulation of a new respiratory illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , with evidence suggesting that the Huanan seafood wholesale market was the initial transmission site. 3 On Jan 1, 2020, the market was closed for environmental sanitation and disinfection to prevent further transmission. 4 Cases of COVID-19 have since been reported in health-care workers 3 and family clusters in China, 5 with 67 794 cases and 3805 deaths confirmed in Hubei province as of March 15, 2020. 6 Older individuals (aged >60 years) and people with chronic underlying health conditions are particularly susceptible to severe disease. 5 Rapid spread of the virus compelled the Chinese Government to restrict movement in affected cities, with the cessation of public transport 7 and cancellation of flights. 8 Despite extensive efforts to prevent onward spread, 143 countries and territories outside of mainland China have now reported imported cases. 6 Internationally, ongoing local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in 81 countries and territories. 6 In Singapore, 243 individuals have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 121 have been hospitalised and are stable, 13 are in a critical condition, and 109 have been discharged at the time of writing. 9 The first case in Singapore was identified on Jan 23, 2020, and was imported from China; 10 a further 68 cases were imported, with the remaining 175 cases most likely the result of transmission within Singapore. 11 All imported cases were travellers who had returned from Wuhan before Feb 4, 2020, with transmission to close contacts recorded within families at a church and shop in three small transmission clusters. 11 As of March 16, 2020, inpatients with COVID-19 in Singapore are isolated at the hospital they present to or at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, a specialised facility designed to facilitate infectious disease outbreak response. 10 A government-wide taskforce has been established to increase surveillance at borders and prepare the public in terms of awareness and education. 10 The Ministry of Health Singapore has implemented contact tracing efforts to identify potential cases among people travelling with, or in close proximity to, individuals with COVID-19. 12 Despite these efforts and nationwide precautionary measures, including the dispensing of masks to households and public hospital emergency departments being on high alert for an outbreak response, the number of suspected and imported cases in Singapore is expected to increase due to the high volume of incoming travellers. 10 Preliminary estimates indicate that the ascertainment rate in Wuhan is 5\u20221% (95% CI 4\u20228-5\u20225); 13 however, high levels of under-reporting and misdiagnosis due to difficulties in identifying cases make it challenging for policy makers to prepare a large-scale response. Consequently, following the recom mendations made by Wu and colleagues, 14 modelling studies are needed to estimate the potential impact of interventions",

Evidence to date has suggested rapid spread of the virus: at the time of writing, imported cases have been reported in 143 countries and territories, including Singapore. 243 confirmed cases have been reported in Singapore; however, this number is expected to increase substantially in the following weeks. In 2003, SARS-CoV, which also originated from mainland China, established locally, causing 33 deaths after 238 cases were confirmed. Therefore, there is considerable concern since 3204 deaths and 81 048 cases of COVID-19 have already been confirmed in mainland China, which surpasses the numbers observed in the SARS-CoV outbreak. 2020 Lunar New Year celebrations have now ended, marking a period of extensive travel between China and Singapore, and a corresponding high risk for case importation. Despite heightened surveillance and isolation of individuals suspected to have COVID-19 and confirmed cases, the risk is ongoing, with the number of cases continuing to increase in Singapore. Immediate deployment of interventions will be required to contain the outbreak in the event that significant secondary local transmission is observed within the community. We searched PubMed from database inception to Feb 26, 2020, for articles using the search terms \"Wuhan coronavirus\", \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"2019-nCoV\", and \"coronavirus interventions\".

The FluTE simulation model requires a synthetic population to build the contact and transmission network. Therefore, we used the geographical, demographic, and epidemiological model of Singapore (hereafter referred to as GeoDEMOS-R, where R represents respiratory illness), 16 a modelling framework that aims to recreate a synthetic but realistic representation of the Singaporean population at the household and individual level. We generated the synthetic population using national 2010 census data 17, 18 to fit multiple attributes of the population at the household and individual level. The generated households contained demographic characteristics, such as age, marital status, religion, and ethnicity, of household members. Individuals were then allocated to workplaces or educational facilities on the basis of local transportation data and home addresses according to 2010 census data. 19 The contact behaviour of individuals in the area of their home (ie, between family members and their local community; defined as the home community), workplace, and school, where applicable, were recorded with potential transmission events as a function of infectivity. We ran the models for 80 days to investigate the early stages of an epidemic and seeded 100 local cases randomly among the resident population at 0 days, representing a few generations of local transmission at the time of scenario implementation (ie, when contact tracing has failed to identify cases within the community and unknown local transmission has started). A full description of the model is available in the appendix (pp 1-5).",

Quarantine of infected individuals is expected to occur 1 day after symptom onset in a health-care facility that is assumed to have 3000 beds at maximum capacity (during the early stage of the outbreak) and is fully equipped to handle full quarantine measures (ie, negative pressure isolation rooms, full personal protective equipment use by staff) so that the individual is unable to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other inpatients. At full capacity, the remaining individuals are isolated at home after receiving treatment. Family members of infected individuals are quarantined at home for 14 days and thus are unable to attend work or school or infect the wider community at their residential address. However, transmission within families is possible as a result of the presence of an isolated and infected individual. Each of these intervention scenarios had 1000 simulations in which we additionally recorded the location of infection as the home community, workplace, or school (appendix pp 3-4).",

The introduction of cases into new countries, regions and cities is likely to continue in areas where local establishment could form, depending on the ongoing level of control measures. In the event that local containment is unsuccessful, our findings suggest that national outbreak control is feasible provided that R 0 is low (\u22641\u20225), with a combination of the proposed inter vention measures (quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing) being most effective. Under this scenario (R 0 =1\u00b75), workplace distancing reduced the median number of cases from 279 000 (IQR 245 000-320 000) to 4000 (200-23 000), as a result of the high employment rates (around 98%) among individuals of working age in Singapore. 25 This observation is consistent with the conclusions of a review of 15 studies that found a median reduction of 23% (range 12-82) in the cumulative influenza A H1N1 attack rate with workplace distancing alone. 26 The implementation of such a control measure, however, is likely to have an acute societal economic effect on individuals who must work from home or take leave, especially if reimbursement is not possible. Thus, decision making becomes a function of risk as to whether the imported cases have or will infect the local population and cause a local outbreak. An R 0 value of 1\u00b75 is not consistent with the evidence from China, 14 and thus prevention of community transmission might not be possible using interventions that would be widely supported by the population. At the start of the outbreak, the risk of repeated importation of SARS-CoV-2 into Singapore was deemed to be considerable given that around 3\u20224 million people travel from Wuhan to Singapore annually. 27 Furthermore, the start of the epidemic coincided with the 2020 Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, with the expectation that the number of individuals arriving from China would be similar to that for the 2018 celebrations (around 800 000 tourists from China). 27 The high influx of incoming travellers exacerbated the risk of local disease establishment, bringing at least 18 initial confirmed imported cases into Singapore before Feb 4, 2020, when the first four local transmission cases were confirmed. 11 These four cases had contact with at least two infected tourists at a shop, who were identified through intensive contact tracing efforts. Although travel is now reduced, at least 175 subsequent locally-acquired infections have been reported at the time of writing across a diverse range of residential and commercial sites despite efforts by the Singaporean Government to quarantine and isolate infected individuals. On March 16, 2020, 11 of the 17 confirmed cases were imported with travel histories including the UK, Indonesia, Portugal, Spain, the USA, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium. 11 On March 17, 2020, a further 17 of 23 cases were reported to be imported. 11 With the risk of disease establishment remaining high from the continued importation of cases, workplace distancing and school closure remain as critical interventions that can avert a significant number of cases.",

Our simulation model, which examined hypothetical infection spread with 100 unidentified Singaporean cases as a seed population, showed that for the baseline scenario (ie, no control interventions) by day 80, when R 0 was 1\u00b75, around 279 000 individuals would be infected, when R 0 was 2\u00b70, around 727 000 individuals would be infected, and when R 0 was 2\u00b75, around 1 207 000 individuals would be infected. In the event that suppression of transmission through quarantine is unsuccessful and local transmission begins, which has currently been observed in other countries on a small scale, 29, 30 policy makers in Singapore should deploy alternate measures, such as school closure and workplace distancing, in a timely manner. School closure has been used in the past in Singapore to limit the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease, and was associated with a decrease of up to 53% in secondary cases, 31 probably because children generally have high contact rates with their peers in the school environment. Given this historical experience, a similar programme for COVID-19 could be established reasonably quickly. However, at present, data on the susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of infected children in Singapore, and the probability of children becoming symptomatic are limited, making school closure less desirable than workplace distancing.",

Under this assumption, the median number of cases averted compared with baseline ranged from 219 000 to 282 000 cases (64\u00b74-82\u00b79% reduction) depending on the intervention scenario. For the quarantine, school-closure, work-distancing, and combined intervention scenarios, assuming an asymptomatic proportion of 7\u00b75% and an R 0 of 1\u00b75, a median of 264 000-277 200 cases (94\u00b76-99\u00b74% reduction) would be averted compared with the baseline scenario. Thus, considering the differences in number of cases averted by proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the population, additional interventions, such as vaccination (where research is rapidly ongoing) or the prescribing of existing antiviral drugs that are effective for the treatment of related viral infections, should be considered. Contact inhibition remains important, but the high proportion of asymptomatic and undocumented infections and missed opportunities to quarantine will make control challenging. Even at a low infectivity (R 0 \u22641\u00b75), a high asymptomatic proportion is problematic, with with 411 000 infections (IQR 223 000-540 000) occurring at an asymptomatic proportion of 22\u00b77% compared with 1800 infections (200-23 000) at a 7\u00b75% asymptomatic proportion. These effects were exacerbated further at higher asymptomatic proportions of 30\u00b70-50\u00b70%. With fewer cases averted and larger outbreak sizes from undocumented spread due to asymptomatic individuals, the dialogue partly shifts from containment to case management to reduce mortality from complications.",

Public complicity is particularly crucial for older individuals (>60 years), individuals who are immunocompromised, and people with comorbidities who are at high risk of severe complications. 5 During the 2003 SARS outbreak, 238 probable SARS cases were reported and 33 individuals died in Singapore, with the highest proportion of deaths (45%) reported among people aged 65 years and older. 32 The same observation is thus expected for COVID-19 should local transmission occur since the median age of infection in our models was 37 years (IQR 26-49), with comparatively few children becoming infected because of school closure and awareness among parents to quarantine children with fever. Singapore has one of the highest employment rates among older individuals (aged \u226565 years) of all countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 33 and a culture of eating at socalled hawker centres (ie, food courts), with around 75% of people visiting a hawker centre at least once a week. 34 Consequently, many older people are expected to be exposed to infection at work or within their home communities, which could be mitigated in part by implementation of workplace distancing and, if possible, incentivisation to remain at home and practise workplace distancing, specifically for older individuals.",

            "text": "At present, the quarantining of family and close contacts of confirmed cases is crucial, as shown by the substantial increase in infection rates among individuals who shared living spaces and bathrooms during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in China, despite the regular disinfection of these areas. 35 The protocols in place at present, including the use of specialist ambulances, negative pressure isolation rooms, and ultraviolet disinfection, will assist in isolating the infection and preventing transmission events at health-care facilities, as was seen during the 2003 SARS outbreak. 21 Since at least 15 medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the virus, 3 Singapore has provided full personal protective equipment for health-care workers; however, the results of our study suggest that community transmission will substantially contribute to transmission should local containment fail despite these measures. The main control measures at this time are surveillance, standard testing procedures, 36 and quarantine of individuals who are confirmed positive for the virus. Such measures have been used in the past for suspected cases of MERS-CoV, which has a 34\u20224% casefatality rate, 37 with no cases of MERS-CoV reported in Singapore to date, and for Zika virus, which established locally in 2016, with only ten cases reported in 2019. 38 Such successes in preventing local outbreaks are attributed to robust disease surveillance in Singapore. Nevertheless, dengue outbreaks are ongoing in Singapore, 39 which highlights the difficulties in disease control that are in part due to undocumented spread and individuals who are asymptomatic; these issues are likely to affect the control of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic since many imported cases worldwide have been asymptomatic on entry to countries. 9 The implementation of school closure and workplace distancing can therefore be considered as a potential secondary control response in the event of infection quarantine failure and the establishment of community transmission.",

Second, a large population of migrant workers who travel from Malaysia to Singapore each day, visiting tourists, and long-term visa owners were not accounted for in our infection dynamics. Third, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 remain uncertain in terms of the transmission and infectivity profile of the virus; therefore, estimates of the time between symptom onset and admission to hospital, how infectious an individual is over time, and the asymptomatic rate were based on SARS-CoV. Once this information becomes available for COVID-19, a full sensitivity analysis should be done. Fourth, the contact patterns between individuals are highly dynamic and heterogeneous across the population; therefore, our simulated work, school, and home popu lations serve as a general estimation of infection spread. Fifth, effectiveness of the interventions might vary depending on the ongoing seeding of imported cases, which we did not account for, and will also rely on intervention compliance. Sixth, multiple indirect effects from the interventions and modifications to human behaviour are likely, which are difficult to quantify and measure. The optimum times to implement each intervention and how long they should be run for to achieve long-term epidemic control should be explored. Finally, there are multiple unforeseen factors that remain challenging to assess at this time, such as increased infection rates at mass gatherings, delays in quarantining as a result of individuals not seeking health care at symptom onset, alternate contact events in locations such as public transport, potential transmission events in the health-care setting, and the effects of community-wide behavioural shifts in response to knowledge of the outbreak.",

In this study, we investigated the use of interventions that aim to restrict contact between individuals at important mixing sites: schools, workplaces, and at home. We found that, especially for lower infection scenarios (R 0 of 1\u00b75), a combined approach comprising quarantine (for infected individuals and their families), school closure, and workplace distancing is effective and could prevent 99\u00b73% of infections (IQR 92\u20226-99\u20229) when compared with the baseline scenario. At higher infectivity scenarios, outbreak prevention becomes considerably more challenging because although effective, transmission events still occur: for the combined approach scenario, a median of 50 000 cases were estimated at R 0 of 2\u00b70 and 258 000 cases at R 0 of 2\u00b75. These combined interventions should therefore be implemented rapidly upon confirmation of second-generation local transmission occurring within the resident population to suppress increases in the national R 0 . At higher asymptomatic rates, public education and case management become increasingly important, with a need to develop vaccines and existing drug therapies.",
