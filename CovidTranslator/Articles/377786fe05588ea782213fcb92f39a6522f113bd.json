To asses the risk factor related to clinical material, climatic condition and type of RT-PCR applied, cloacal swabs (CS), faeces, sera, bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus (TH) and spleen (SP) and ileumcaeca region were collected from 30-day-old poults suffering of enteritis episode characterized as poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS). The PEMS clinical features were characterized by watery to foamy faeces, light brown-yellow in colour and low mortality rate. Meteorological data (rainfall and relative humidity) observed during along the study presented monthly average temperature ranging from 39.3 and 31.2\u00baC, precipitation in rainy season from 40 to 270.3 mm/month, and no rain during dry season. Simplex RT-PCR gave odds ratio (OR) values suggesting that ileum-caeca region is at higher chance (OR=1.9; p=0.9741) to have both viral RNA than faeces (OR=1.5; p=0.7319). However, multiplex RT-PCR showed 3.98 (p=0.89982) more chance to give positive results in faeces than CS at dry season. The major risk factors seem to be low rate of humidity and high temperatures at winter, probably responsible for spread, easily, the TCoV and TAstv-2 among the flocks. The positive results of both virus suggested that they can play an important role in enteric disorders, associated to low humidity and high temperatures frequently found in tropical countries.",

            "text": "Avian astroviruses belong to the genus Avastrovirus of the Astroviridae family. The viral particles are small, non-enveloped, positive sense RNA viruses, 28 to 30nm in diameter, and have a star-like morphology (21) . Turkey Astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) was first described in 1980 by McNulty et al. (22) in the United Kingdom, and the first isolated of TAstV in the United States was identified in 1985 (15) . A second TAstV type, which was antigenically and genetically distinct from the previously identified as TAstV-1, was isolated 1996 and designated as TAstV-2 (13, 31, 32) . The entire genome sequence of the TAstV-2 isolate, NC/96, has been reported and bears many similar features to Human Astrovirus (HAstV) (15) . Moreover, astroviruses are linked with enteric disease in humans and young animals such as calves, lambs, pigs, dogs, cats and minks (15, 21) . The most important infectious disease caused by TAstV are the enteric diseases affecting the digestive tract of commercial poults proposed to result in more economic loss than those affecting any other system reported worldwide, including Brazil (16, 17, 26, 27, 28, 30, 34, 35) . In addition, no vaccine currently exists for the enteric disease caused by astroviruses, which leads the disease to the bio-security manners to control virus infection and spread (15) .",

Based on the climatic characteristic, these two regions are totally opposite from each other. The producer region chosen for the present study is characterized by high relative humidity during the summer and dried winter, mean monthly temperatures ranged 30\u00baC, localized in South Eastern of the country. The samples were collected in 5 times point, along the year from February to December, including summer and winter. The flocks aged \u2245 30 days, distant from each other 2 Km, presenting more than 10.000 birds in a large growing scale under straight bio-security manners, presenting 10% of mortality in average were included on this study. The samples were collected monthly by specialized veterinarians, and sent to Laboratory under -4\u00baC for virology investigation.

The non coincidence between number of collected organs and number of studied poults was due to time after death. So, by macroscopic evaluation only organs without necrosis were used for the study. Half of each organ was kept under -86\u00baC as a source of original virus, and the other half readily submitted to prepare the respective tissue suspension (34) . The respective cloacal swabs (CS; n=500), faeces (n=500) and sera (n=500) were collected from symptomatic birds stored under -86\u00baC until its use. The criterion of inclusion used was: prevalence of at least 25% for both viruses, a confidence interval (CI) of 95% and a mean flock size of 5000 birds (range 1.000-10.000). In order to determine the major risk factor involved (climatic conditions) in disseminate both viruses amongst turkeys from the same flock, the CS and respective faeces were assayed, and the results compared according to percentage of positives (winter and summer) found by both RT-PCR approaches.",

Moreover, this is the first study reporting the applicability of multiplex RT-PCR performed on different clinical material. Interesting, the TAstV-2 could be detected, for the first time in sera collected from naturally infected poults, demonstrating early stages of virus infection characterized by viremic phase, only reported in experimentally infection (17, 26) . Herein, major risk factor was described as being faeces samples, whereas both virus RNA were 3.98 times more evidenced in winter by the use of multiplex RT-PCR assay. In spite of bio-security measures implemented elsewhere, the TCoV and TAstV-2 control in endemic areas has proven to be difficult (25) . In a recent study, periodic monitoring of commercial turkey for enteric viruses has indicated continuous presence of astrovirus among healthy flocks (25) . Otherwise, recent TCoV outbreak in North Carolina, a potential vector has been indicated responsible for spread the virus, since the incidence of infection increase during summer months, coinciding with increased fly populations (3) . Besides, the outbreak observed in Wales and England in summer 2004 was probably occasioned by multi-age farms management, when the simple rescheduling of production resulted in a substantial reduction in number of affected birds (9) . As shown by the results, in tropical countries the incidence of the same disease was observed during winter season, as reported by Teixeira et al. (28, 30) and Villareal et al. (35) . Concern about sequencing, recent work has demonstrated that genetic differences on TAstV-2 capsid gene do not promote any different enteric disease (26) . In this way, the infection of TAstV-2 may affect the immune system by causing bursal lymphoid depletion, which can explain the positive results obtained from this tissue. Recently, it has demonstrated young poults affected by Poult Enteritis Complex (PEC) showing impairment of lymphoid organs (28, 30) . Furthermore, TAstV-2 and TCoV has been described to co-circulate among different species (4, 12) . However, more studies are still necessary to explain this mechanism associated to others enteric pathogens among Brazilian flocks (35) .",

As a consequence, effective control of endemic areas, in tropical countries, is dependent upon managing the litter, proper faeces disposable and climatic factors of the semiarid areas, which consequently affect the PEMS prevention. It is important to emphasize that, in spite of high bio-security level of turkey production worldwide the enteric episodes are still the major concern among avian pathologists.",

Os principais fatores de risco associado a preval\u00eancia foram material cl\u00ednico analisado, condi\u00e7\u00f5es clim\u00e1ticas e tipo de t\u00e9cnica molecular empregada. Os sinais cl\u00ednicos foram caracterizados como intenso fluido intestinal e baixo crescimento em aves jovens, sendo o material coletado swabs cloacais, fezes, soros, bursa de Fabr\u00edcius, segmentos do intestino delgado, timo e ba\u00e7o. Os dados meteorol\u00f3gicos (\u00edndice pluviom\u00e9trico e umidade relativa) desta regi\u00e3o, durante o per\u00edodo de estudo, foram de temperatura m\u00e9dia mensal variando de 39.3 a 31.2\u00baC, precipita\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e9poca chuvosa variando de 40 a 270.3mm/m\u00eas e aus\u00eancia de chuva na esta\u00e7\u00e3o fria e seca. A t\u00e9cnica de simplex RT-PCR resultou em valores de odds ratio (OR) que sugerem que a regi\u00e3o do intestino delgado (jun\u00e7\u00e3o \u00edleo-cecal) possui alta chance (1.9 vezes) de gerar resultados positivos na amplifica\u00e7\u00e3o de RNA viral que as fezes (1.5 vezes) analisadas. A t\u00e9cnica de multiplex RT-PCR demonstrou ser 3.98 vezes mais eficiente em promover resultados positivos nas fezes que nos swabs cloacais, durante a \u00e9poca de inverno. Os maiores fatores de risco encontrados foram baixa umidade relativa associada a altas temperaturas, durante a esta\u00e7\u00e3o seca, o que pode permitir uma maior dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o a\u00e9rea do ambos os v\u00edrus entre os lotes estudados. A alta preval\u00eancia detectada para dois v\u00edrus sugerem que, no Brasil, estes representam os maiores respons\u00e1veis pelos surtos de enterite viral nas regi\u00f5es semi\u00e1ridas, associado a baixas umidades e altas temperaturas t\u00edpicas de pa\u00edses tropicais.",
