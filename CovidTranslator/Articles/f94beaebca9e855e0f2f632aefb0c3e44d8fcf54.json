            "text": "In a recent prevalence study of nosocomial infection in the United Kingdom (Meers et al., 1981) , there were surprisingly few reports of virus-associated disease. There is, however, clear evidence that enteric viruses may be transmitted to patients in hospitals and other confined communities. The spread of enteroviruses such as Echo (Nagington et al., 1978) and Coxsackie (Pether, 1982) is known to occur in these environments and in the case of neonates has occasionally resulted in serious illness with significant mortality. Transmission of hepatitis A virus has also been documented as an infection hazard, especially in institutions caring for mentally retarded children (Krugman and Giles, 1970) . During the last decade viruses have been recognized as an important major cause of acute diarrhoeal disease. At present rotavirus infection is thought to account for the majority of these cases although there is increasing evidence of episodes associated with other agents, e.g. adenovirus (Flewett et al., 1975) , astrovirus (Kurtz, Lee and Pickering, 1977) , calicivirus (Cubitt, McSwiggan and Arstall, 1980) and coronavirus (Caul, Paver and Clarke, 1975) .",

We have investigated an episode in which infection was accompanied by severe illness which resulted in a number of deaths. Rotavirus may become endemic in such units and under these circumstances infected babies often remain asymptomatic (Chrystie, Totterdell and Banatvala, 1978) . Evidence for this situation was provided by a study of the RNA profiles of rotaviruses affecting neonates in a unit in JJelbourne (Rodger et al., 1981) . In this study, certain strains of virus persisted in the unit for a period of up to four years and differed from strains circulating in the community during this time. Rotavirus infection requiring hospital admission is most common in the six months to three years age group. Nosocomial infections are extremely common in this age range (Holmes, 1979) . Recently there have also been a number of reports of infection in adults, involving both patients and staff. These have taken place in an obstetric unit (Hildreth, Thomas and Ridgeway, 1981) and in several wards and residential homes caring for elderly patients (Cubitt and Holzel, 1980; Holzel et al., 1980) . In these episodes symptoms ranged from mild diarrhoea to severe gastrointestinal fluid loss requiring intravenous rehydration.",

During the last year, both astrovirus (Lee and Kurtz, 1981) and adenovirus type 38 (De Jong et al., 1981) h ave been propagated in vitro and further progress along these lines should lead to the development of less sophisticated and expensive means of diagnosis. Transmission of enteric viruses is generally considered to be via the faecaloral route and spread of infection may be from patient to patient, or via members of the hospital staff. Upper respiratory tract symptoms are, however, not infrequently reported in association with gastrointestinal disturbance (Steinhoff, 1980; Cubitt and McSwiggan, 1981) . These findings suggest that spread of virus may occur via the respiratory route, a possibility which requires further investigation.",

These reports indicated that 90 per cent ethanol was the most effective agent against a whole range of enteric viruses. Tan and Schnagl found that commonly used disinfectants, such as 'Hexol', 'Hibiclens' and 'Betadine', were of little value. These findings should be considered in formulating policies both for hand washing and for the disinfection of contaminated equipment.
