An approximate 1.0 kb DNA fragment, encoding for glycoprotein M, was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pVAX1. The recombinant plasmid pVAX-M was transformed by electroporation into attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207, and the expression and translation of the pVAX-M delivered by recombinant S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-M) was detected both in vitro and in vivo. BALB/c mice were inoculated orally with SL7207 (pVAX-M) at different dosages to evaluate safety of the vaccines. The bacterium was safe to mice at a dosage of 2 9 10 9 CFU, almost eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization and eventually cleared at week 6. Mice immunized with 1 9 10 9 CFU of SL7207 (pVAX-M) elicited specific anti-TGEV local mucosal and humoral responses including levels of IgA, IgG, IL-4, and IFN-c as measured by indirect ELISA assay. Moreover, the control groups (pVAX group, PBS group) maintained at a normal level during week 4-8 post-immunization. The results indicated that attenuated S. typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector for oral immunization of TGEV M gene vaccine.",

Three structural proteins (S, N, M) were expressed with baculovirus and intraperitoneal inoculated to pigs. The results showed that these proteins induced intestinal mucosal immunity concerned with IgA antibodies to TGEV and confirmed that there was an increase in the occurrence of CD4 ? CD8 ?

As a live vaccine vector, attenuated S. typhimurium has weak virulence and good invasiveness [15, 19, 33, 34] . Meanwhile, bacteria carrying the heterologous antigens orally immunized after presentation to the host immune system can induce anti-specific antigen local and systemic immune response [1, 10, 12] . In particular, attenuated S. typhimurium has been used to deliver DNA vaccines encoding immunogens of pathogenic microorganisms including HIV and PRRSV [13, 14] . Our previous studies revealed that attenuated S. typhimurium was a good carrier for TGEV S gene [33] ; however, the use of S. typhimurium as a DNA vaccine vector harboring TGEV M gene has almost not been reported. In this study, to investigate the feasibility of an oral vaccine based on TGEV M gene, we constructed DNA vaccines encoding the intact TGEV glycoprotein M using the attenuated intracellular bacteria, attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207, and its safety and immunogenicity has been evaluated. Our preliminary data indicated that immunizing by orogastric intubation with the recombinant S. typhimurium could induce a specific immune response against TGEV.",

Several systems have been used to express the full-length or truncated TGEV S proteins such as Salmonella, Lactobacillus casei, and plants [11, 28, 34 ]. However, the expression level of antigen protein in transgenic plants is generally low and will lose its bioactivity due to the degradation of stomach acid [3, 10] .

            "text": "Stable expression of antigen gene is extremely important for oral vaccine using attenuated Salmonella, as it relates to whether it could constantly effectively stimulate the body to produce an immune response. Studies affirmed that stability of plasmid might be relevant to the plasmid copy number [6] , and ovalbumin expressed by an attenuated Salmonella harboring a low-copy number plasmid could stimulate to produce specific anti-ovalbumin (CTLs reaction) when carrying a high-copy number plasmid cannot [29] . In order to enhance plasmid stability during immunization, antibiotics were injected into the mice with the period of immunity, yet the result revealed that it is not practical to get the plasmids enhanced in vivo by this method [27] . In this study, stability of recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine SL7207 (pVAX-M) in vivo or in vitro was detected. The results showed that the bacteria were reduced to nearly 50 % without kanamycin resistance in the stability test in vitro during the 18 h observation. In safety study, neither deaths nor side effects were found in mice post-inoculation with attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-M) at different dosages (5 9 l0 8 , 1 9 10 9 , 2 9 10 9 CFU). No bacteria were recovered in liver and spleen in different dosage groups after 2 weeks of boosting, indicating that attenuated S. typhimurium could be eliminated by immune system after completing the plasmid delivery. At the same time, we noticed that one week after boosting, bacteria separated from liver and spleen in different dosage groups were significantly lower at the 3rd week after first inoculation, which indicated the elimination of immune system to bacterial enhanced with the increase of inoculation frequency. And 6 weeks after the first immunization, recombinant attenuated Salmonella were finally eliminated from the body, thus indicating that the strain of the SL7207 (pVAX-M) could exist steadily. All the results above indicate that the use of attenuated S. typhimurium is an ideal choice of delivery vector for DNA vaccine orally, concerning safety for livestock. Our data showed that the attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-M) has relatively good safety for bodies.",

In the view of TGEV pathogenesis, livestock was infected by the virus through the digestive tract and it is difficult for bodies to gain protection by IgG antibody, therefore gut-specific sIgA antibodies produced by mammalian mucosal immune protection are more significant. In our study, after orally immunizing constructed DNA vaccine containing attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-M), specific serum antibodies were detected at week 2 continuing into week 8, which has appeared (very) significantly when compared with SL7207 (pVAX) group and the PBS group. The levels of both IgG and IgA antibodies had a peak level at week 6, and then gradually decreased until week 8 the last week we detected. Using mice animal models, the experiments conducted in this study showed that the level of the antibodies of IgG and IgA immunized with SL7207 (pVAX-M) was higher than in those immunized with SL7207 (pVAX-S) which is consistent with previous results in attenuated S. typhimurium harboring TGEV S gene [33] .",

Moreover, challenge protection test for the evaluation of the effect of a new vaccine is essential, but the test cannot be conducted on the species of mice. In this study, we constructed the SL7207 (pVAX-M) M gene of TGEV, and safety and immunogenicity were preliminarily assessed using mice animal models. TGEV easily infects clinically neonatal swine in 10 days which is prone to diarrhea in stress conditions. Attenuated Salmonella test results indicated that it can be released to carry the DNA vaccine in mice, and induce humoral immunity, mucosal immunity, and cellular immune responses. In our previous study, Zhang [35] immunized 20-day-old piglets by the SL7207 Virus Genes (2016) 52:218-227 225 (pVAX-N) oral vaccine and the serum was first collected to detect IgG and IgA at week 2 post-immunization, and the result claimed that the experiment group (pVAX-N) is improved significantly contrasting with the control group (P \\ 0.05). Even if the vaccine of Zhang's induced a good immune response, however, the best time of PEDV infection had passed in these piglets. However, the mouse model itself has advantages: reducing the costs of tests, requiring smaller cultured space, and shortening the period of immune response. Balb/C mice were immunized at doses which were 5 % and 10 % formulation administered in cattle to evaluate immunogenicity of the inactivated vaccine against food-and-mouth disease virus, and specific antibodies were detected in 14, 21, 28 days post-immunization which showed an adequate immune response to the vaccine with 10 % of the immunizing dose at the 21st day psot immunization [18] . Deng found that PCV-2b could be replicated in mice and caused mice tissue damages that has its similarity in tissue damage caused in pigs, indicating that mice could be used as animal models for research of the vaccine [5] . Gravier's studies have claimed that DNA vaccines have similar biodistribution in mouse, rabbit, and pig tissues in vivo [9] . Our further studies will focus on effective evaluation of the oral vaccine, and pregnant sows were designed to be immunized by the SL7207 (pVAX-N) oral vaccine and their piglets within 10 days of age were chosen to perform challenge assay and neutralizing assay.",

Mice in group A, which received SL7207 (pVAX-M) at a dosage of 10 9 CFU, showed different levels of antibody response during the experiment. At week 6 post-immunization, the antibody titers generated in group A reached their peak. There were no detectable specific anti-TGEV antibodies in the SL7207 (pVAX) group (group B) and PBS group (group C) during experiment. Expression levels of IL-4 and IFN-c IL-4 and IFN-c standard curves were plotted according to the USA R&D system of mouse IL-4 and IFN-c detection kit, respectively. Standard detection results of the regression equation of IL-4: y = 40.218x 2 ? 11.623x ? 5.638, R 2 = 0.9114, and the regression equation of the standard curve of IFN-c: y = 253.98x 2 ? 51.583x ? 51.244, R 2 = 0.9433. The result was calculated by using curve equation concentration of the samples, and the contents change maps were shown in Fig. 9 IL-4 induced by recombinant SL7207 (pVAX-M) was detected on the 2nd",

Current researches mainly focus on TGEV S and N genes, while there are only very few studies on the M gene, and we expressed TGEV M gene by the eukaryotic system for the first time. In this study, TGEV SC-H strain M with gene length of 989 bp was successfully amplified by RT-PCR including sequence of the open reading frame encoding 262 amino acids. The M gene was also detected by RT-PCR and M protein was detected by Western bolting and indirect immunofluorescence assays after eukaryotic expression plasmid (pVAX-M) transfected into HEK 293 cells, which aids a foundation for follow-up research.",
