In some prokaryotic cases such as the dnaX gene of Escherichia coli, an additional stimulatory signal-an upstream, internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence-is also necessary to stimulate the efficient \u00c0 1 frameshifting. However, the molecular and physical mechanism of the \u00c0 1 frameshifting is poorly understood. Here, we propose a model of the pathway of the \u00c0 1 translational frameshifting during ribosome translation of the dnaX \u00c0 1 frameshift mRNA. With the model, the single-molecule fluorescence data (Chen et al. (2014) [29]) on the dynamics of the shunt either to long pausing or to normal translation, the tRNA transit and sampling dynamics in the long-paused rotated state, the EF-G sampling dynamics, the mean rotated-state lifetimes, etc., are explained quantitatively. Moreover, the model is also consistent with the experimental data (Yan et al. (2015) [30]) on translocation excursions and broad branching of frameshifting pathways. In addition, we present some predicted results, which can be easily tested by future optical trapping experiments.",

            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a process where specific signals in the messenger RNA (mRNA) direct the translating ribosome to shift the reading frame. Many viruses including HIV-1 employ the programmed ribosomal frameshifting to control the ratio between structural and enzymatic proteins [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . When the reading frame is shifted by one base in the 3\u2032 direction it is called \u00fe1 frameshifting, while when the reading frame is shifted by one base in the 5\u2032 direction it is called \u00c0 1 frameshifting [8] [9] [10] [11] . It was characterized that the amino acid starvation, i.e., the limitation for particular amino acids, can induce the \u00fe1 frameshifting [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The \u00c0 1 frameshifting often occurs at the slippery sequence with a form of X_XXY_YYZ on the presence of a downstream mRNA pseudoknot, where codons are shown in the initiation reading frame, with dashes separating in-frame triplets [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In some prokaryotic cases, an additional stimulatory signal-an upstream, internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence-is also necessary to stimulate the efficient \u00c0 1 frameshifting. For example, the dnaX gene of Escherichia coli has three stimulatory signals-an SD sequence, an A_AAA_AAG slippery sequence and a downstream stem loop or hairpin [11, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

[22] proposed that the \u00c01 frameshifting occurs when deacylated transfer RNA (tRNA) is located in the E/E site, the peptidyl-tRNA located in the P/P site and the aminoacyl-tRNA located in the A/T entry site. Plant et al. [23] proposed a 9 \u00c5 model, which is based on the proposal of a movement of 9 \u00c5 by the anticodon loop of the aminoacyl-tRNA between the A/T state of initial binding and the A/ A state of the full accommodation. The movement induces the \u00c0 1 frameshifting. Based on the cryo-EM imaging of the mammalian 80S ribosome stalled at an mRNA pseudoknot structure which contains a structurally distorted tRNA in A/P\u2032 hybrid state [24, 25] . Namy et al. proposed that the stereochemical mismatch between the pseudoknot structure and the entrance geometry of the mRNA channel blocks the entry of the downstream mRNA, causing a tension in the mRNA that bends the tRNA in a (\u00fe) sense (3\u2032) direction. As a result, the codon-anticodon interaction breaks over the slippery sequence, allowing a spring-like relaxation of the tRNA in a ( \u00c0 ) sense (5\u2032) direction and thus causing the tRNA to repair with the mRNA in the \u00c0 1 position. Based on the above three models, Liao et al. [26] developed a kinetic model which proposes that the \u00c0 1 frameshifting can occur during the translocation step, as proposed in the model by Leger et al. [22] and that by Namy et al. [24] , and/or the aminoacyl-tRNA accommodation step, as proposed in the model by Plant et al. [23] . Recently, Bailey et al. [27] developed a mathematical model that treats mRNA translation and associated \u00c0 1 frameshifting as a stochastic process in Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/bbrep which the transition probabilities are based on the energetics of local molecular interactions, with which the location and efficiency of \u00c0 1 frameshift events in HIV-1 were studied. We proposed another model for the dynamics of the \u00c0 1 frameshifting during the translation of the mRNA containing the slippery sequence and downstream mRNA pseudoknot [28] , where a systematical analysis of the \u00c0 1 frameshifting that can occur during every transition step in the elongation phase showed that the \u00c0 1 frameshifting takes place mainly during the translocation over the sequence, as proposed by Namy et al. [24] , and simultaneously provided a consistent explanation of a lot of available independent experimental data.",

[29] made a detailed experimental study of the dynamics of the \u00c0 1 frameshifting during translation of the dnaX \u00c0 1 frameshift mRNA by using single-molecule fluorescence to track directly the compositional and conformational dynamics of individual ribosomes at each codon. Based on their observations they proposed a model of dynamic pathway of the dnaX \u00c0 1 frameshifting (see Fig. S1 ). In the model, the stochastic interaction of the ribosome with the hairpin helix in an open or closed state and/or formation of the SD and antiSD pairing interaction represent the shunt to either pausing in the rotated state or normal translation. If the hairpin is in open state, the translocation of the ribosomes with the normal translation is coupled with the reverse intersubunit rotation. If the hairpin is in closed state, the translocation of the paused ribosomes is uncoupled with the reverse intersubunit rotation (called \"uncoupled\" translocation), causing the ribosomes to enter into the long-paused rotated state. However, a quantitative calculation showed that the opening probability of the hairpin helix is only 5.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 4 (see Section S1), which significantly deviates from the observation showing that about 25% fraction of the ribosomes undergo the normal translation [29] . Then, what is the molecular mechanism of the hairpin and the SD and inti-SD interaction stimulating the shunt to either the long-paused rotated state or the normal translation? Moreover, as the \"uncoupled\" translocation involves no reverse intersubunit rotation, then how the \"uncoupled\" translocation occurs is unclear. In the long-paused rotated state, the detailed mechanism of how elongation factor G (EF-G) and tRNA compete for the binding to the ribosome and how the rotated state is finally resolved by EF-G, etc., is also not clear.",

            "text": "(i) The available structural data [33] showed that the binding of tRNA to the A-site of the ribosome results in the 30S ribosomal subunit to transit from an open to a closed form, in which the shoulder and head domains are rotated towards the subunit center, whereas when the decoding center is unoccupied the 30S subunit is in the open conformation. Based on these structural data, we argue that the ternary complex consisting of the aminoacyl-tRNA, EF-Tu and GTP can bind efficiently to the ribosome with an open conformation of the 30S subunit, whereas the ternary complex cannot bind efficiently to the ribosome with the closed form of the 30S subunit. After the binding of the ternary complex, the subsequent codon recognition results in the transition of the 30S subunit from the open to closed conformation. (ii) The peptidyl transfer or removal from the P-site tRNA results in the ribosome in a \"labile\" state, allowing the relative rotation between the two ribosomal subunits, with one conformation as non-rotated and the other one as rotated [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . The labile ribosome also allows the binding of EF-G. The binding of EF-G complexed with either GTP [35, 36, 39] or GDP [40, 41] facilitates transition to and then stabilizes the rotated state. (iii) We argue that in the closed conformation of the 30S subunit, the binding of EF-G.GTP to the rotated state and then GTP hydrolysis drives a conformational rearrangement of the ribosome (referred to as ribosomal unlocking, as done in the literature), inducing the 30S subunit to transit from the closed to open conformation, opening the mRNA channel, and then facilitating the reverse intersubunit rotation from the rotated to non-rotated state and Pi release. By contrast, in the open conformation of the 30S subunit, the binding of EF-G.GTP and then GTP hydrolysis is inefficient to induce the ribosomal unlocking. The argument is inferred from the following pieces of experimental evidence. It is experimentally shown that a tRNA anticodon stem-loop bound to the 30S A site is minimally required for translocation of mRNA [42] , and the translocation can only occur efficiently after the ribosomal unlocking catalyzed by GTP hydrolysis [43] . On the other hand, the presence of the tRNA anticodon stem-loop bound to the 30S A site implies that the codon recognition has occurred, resulting in the 30S subunit to transit to closed conformation [33] . (iv) The 50S E and P sites have a high affinity for deacylated tRNA and the peptidyl-tRNA, respectively [44, 45] . (v) We argue that after transition to the non-rotated conformation the mRNA channel in the 30S subunit becomes tight, as proposed before based on available structural data [46, 47] . In other words, in the non-rotated conformation the mRNA channel is always tight. (vi) We argue that the peptidyl-tRNA in the \"canonical\" P/P conformation induces efficiently the labile ribosome to be \"nonlabile\", 1 as evidenced from the cryo-EM studies [36] . The ribosome in the non-labile state inhibits the intersubunit rotations and prohibits the binding of EF-G. In other words, the peptidyl-tRNA in the \"non-canonical\" P/P conformation such as the severely deformed peptidyl-tRNA cannot induce efficiently the labile ribosome to be non-labile.",

In the literature, the \"non-labile\" ribosome is usually called the ribosome in \"locking\" state. Here, for distinguishing from the \"unlocking\" state mentioned above, we use the \"non-labile\" instead of \"locking\". transfer, with deacylated tRNA in the P/P site and the peptidyl-tRNA in the A/A site (State C0). Before EF-G.GTP binding, the labile ribosome allows the spontaneous counterclockwise (viewed from the exterior of the 30S) rotation of the 30S subunit relative to the 50S subunit and vice verse, which are called forward and reverse intersubunit rotations, respectively. The spontaneous intersubunit rotations result in the ribosomal complex to transit from the non-rotated State C0 to rotated or hybrid State H0 and vice verse. The two states are in thermodynamic equilibrium, with the majority being in State H0 [37] [38] [39] . Since in both State C0 and State H0 the 30S A site is occupied, the binding of the ternary complex is not allowed. EF-G.GTP can bind to the labile State C0 and State H0 [49] [50] [51] [52] . (i) If EF-G.GTP binds to State H0 (becoming State H1), after rapid GTP hydrolysis the ribosomal unlocking occurs, opening the mRNA channel and the 30S subunit (State H2). The subsequent reverse intersubunit rotation makes the 30S subunit move downstream relative to the mRNA that is coupled with the two tRNAs by one codon, while the high affinity of the 50S E and P sites for the two tRNAs [44, 45] fixes the two tRNAs to the 50S subunit. This results in the transition of State H2 to posttranslocation state (State POST). Facilitated by the ribosomal unlocking, Pi is also released rapidly and independently of the reverse intersubunit rotation [43] . (ii) If EF-G.GTP binds to State C0 (becoming State C), the transition from State C to State H1 is facilitated mildly [39] and the hybrid State H1 is then stabilized [35, 36, 39] . Since the EF-G-facilitated transition from State C to State H1 (with a rate o10 s \u00c0 1 [39, 53] ) is much slower than GTP hydrolysis (with a rate of about 250 s \u00c0 1 [43] ), GTP hydrolysis occurs mainly at State C and State H1 is in EF-G.GDP.Pi form, consistent with the available experimental data [54] . In State H1 the ribosomal unlocking occurs (becoming State H2). Then, the reverse intersubunit rotation results in the transition of State H2 to State POST.",

However, if the downstream duplex is present, due to the competition between the free energy change of unwinding three mRNA base pairs and that of breaking the interaction of the two tRNAs with the 50S E and P sites, two possibilities of transitions from State H2 can be caused by the reverse intersubunit rotation (Fig. 2) [55] . (i) The reverse intersubunit rotation makes the 30S subunit move downstream relative to the mRNA coupled with the two tRNAs by overcoming the free energy of unwinding three mRNA base pairs, while the high binding energy of the two tRNAs to the 50S E and P sites fixes the two tRNAs to the 50S subunit. This results in the transition of State H2 to State POST, as in Fig. 1 , which is called effective translocation. (ii) The reverse intersubunit rotation makes the 50S subunit move relative to the two tRNAs by overcoming the binding energy of the two tRNAs to the 50S E and P sites, while the resistance from the downstream duplex prevents the 30S subunit from moving relative to the mRNA coupled with the two tRNAs.

In the model (Fig. 2) , the ribosome uses only one mechanism to unwind the mRNA duplex [55] , rather than uses two mechanisms as proposed by Qu et al. [56] . As shown before, with the consideration of the futile translocation various single-molecule experimental data such as the optical-trapping data on the rate and dwell-time distribution of translation through the mRNA duplex versus the pulling force to unzip the duplex [56, 57] and the smFRET (single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer) data on the dynamics of slow dissociation of deacylated tRNA from the E site induced by the downstream secondary structures [58] can be explained quantitatively [55, 59, 60] . In particular, the recent high-resolution smFRET data of Kim et al. [61] give a strong support to the futile translocation, which showed that when translates through the mRNA containing the downstream stem loop the ribosomal complex exhibits multiple fluctuations between the classical non-rotated state (State FC in Fig. 2 ) and hybrid state (State FH, State H1 and State H2) before undergoing mRNA translocation (State POST) at saturating EF-G, whereas when translates through the mRNA lacking the stem loop the ribosomal complex samples the hybrid state (State H1 and State H2) only once before undergoing mRNA translocation [62] . In addition, the consideration of the futile translocation is consistent with the proposal of futile elongation factor 2 (eEF2) cycling during ribosomal translocation in 80S ribosome with the presence of mRNA secondary structures by Flanagan et al.

In State FS, due to the peptidyl moiety being fixed to the 50S P site by the specific interaction between them, the movement of 50S subunit relative to the mRNA that is coupled to the anticodon of tRNA causes the bending of tRNA. In the case with only downstream mRNA secondary structure but without upstream SD sequence, considering 2 Note 2. It is considered that a reverse intersubunit rotation justly makes the 30S subunit move relative to the mRNA by a codon (three nucleotides) in the 3\u2032 direction with the 50S subunit being kept fixed to the two tRNAs (the effective translocation) or make the 50S subunit move relative to the mRNA by three nucleotides in the 5\u2032 direction (i.e., the two tRNAs move from the 50S E and P sites to 50S P and A sites) but with the 30S subunit being kept fixed to the mRNA (the futile translocation). Thus, the two cases will not cause bending of the tRNAs. However, if the reverse intersubunit rotation is realized by making 30S subunit move relative to the mRNA by two nucleotides in the 3\u2032 direction and making 50S subunit move relative to the mRNA by one nucleotide in the 5\u2032 direction, considering that the peptidyl moiety is fixed to the 50S P site by the specific interaction between them and the anticodon of the peptidyl-tRNA is paring with codon XXX, the movements would cause bending of the peptidyl-tRNA. that the pulling on the mRNA that arises from the annealing tendency of the unwound mRNA base pairs would also cause the anticodon stem loop of the tRNA to bias toward the A-site, the structural feature of State FS would be similar to that observed in 80S ribosomal complex bound with eEF2 by Namy et al. [24, 25] showing a spring-like deformation of the tRNA in A/P\u2032 state. For the system with no SD sequence involvement, although the bent tRNA is biased toward the A-site, the A-site is left open to some extent, allowing for aminoacyl-tRNA binding. Thus, the model ( Fig. 3 ) could also be applicable to the system with the IBV pseudoknot but without the SD sequence [24, 25] .",

If the arriving tRNA is cognate to codon YYZ, the codon recognition will facilitate the peptidyl-tRNA to shift the reading frame from codon XXX (State FS2) to codon XXY (State NF2). If the arriving tRNA is cognate to codon YYY, no shift of the reading frame of the peptidyl-tRNA will occur. Thus, whether the \u00c0 1 frameshifting can occur or not is determined mainly by the arriving tRNAs in State FS2, which is in turn determined by their magnitudes in the binding affinity to the ribosome and the relative concentrations in solution. The codon recognition induces the open 30S subunit transiting to closed conformation, triggering GTPase activation, GTP hydrolysis and Pi release (State FS3). The resultant conformational change of EF-Tu induces the accommodation of the aminoacyl-tRNA and EF-Tu.GDP release (State FS4). Note that during the codon recognition, i.e., before the 30S subunit becoming closed, the aminoacyl-tRNA can be dissociated [63, 64] , returning to State FS1. Note also that after the codon recognition, i.e., after the 30S subunit becoming closed, but before the completion of the accommodation, the aminoacyl-tRNA can also be dissociated [63, 64] , with State FS3 transiting to State FS5. For the ribosome in the non-canonical rotated conformation, the probabilities of the aminoacyl-tRNA dissociation in the two steps could be much larger than those for the ribosome in the canonical nonrotated conformation due partially to the fact that in the non-canonical rotated state the process of the codon recognition and that of the accommodation could be elongated greatly. Thus, multiple bindings of the ternary complex can occur in the stalled rotated state, which is consistent with the single-molecule data [29] . Since in State FS5 the 30S subunit is in the closed conformation, the ternary complex cannot bind efficiently, but EF-G.GTP binds efficiently. As the 30S subunit is now in the closed conformation, the GTP hydrolysis can induce efficiently the ribosomal unlocking (State FS6), inducing the 30S subunit transiting to open conformation and facilitating the reverse intersubunit rotation and Pi release.

With the presence of the tRNA anticodon stem-loop bound to the 30S A site, i.e., with the 30S subunit in the closed conformation, after EF-G.GTP binding and then GTP hydrolysis (State FS8), the ribosomal unlocking occurs efficiently (State FS9), facilitating the reverse intersubunit rotation and Pi release. Due to the specific affinity of the 50S P and A sites for the peptidyl-tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA, respectively, and the resistance of the mRNA duplex to the downstream movement of the 30S subunit, the reverse intersubunit rotation causes the rotated State FS9 to nonrotated State FS10. In State FS10, the mRNA channel becomes tight and the peptidyl-tRNA in the canonical P/P conformation induces the ribosome to be non-labile. After EF-G.GDP release and the efficient peptidyl transfer in the canonical non-rotated state, the ribosomal complex returns to Sate C0. Note that the transition from State FS3 to State C0 via State FS4, State FS8, State FS9 and State FS10 gives overlap of a tRNA pulse with the reverse rotation of the long pause, as observed experimentally (see Extended data Fig. 10c in Chen et al.

By contrast, the transition from State FS3 to State C0 via State FS5, State FS6 and State FS7 gives correlation of tRNA arrival and reverse rotation of the ribosome after the long rotated-state pause, as observed experimentally (see Extended data Fig. 10c in Chen et al. [29] , case 1).",

            "text": "Based on the experimental data, Chen et al. [29] proposed a model of the elongation pathway for translation at the slippery site (i.e., at codon AAA 24 ) where both the SD-antiSD interaction and the downstream hairpin are present (see Fig. S1 ). The model argued that the translocation that is uncoupled with the reverse intersubunit rotation (called \"uncoupled\" translocation) can occur at codon AAA 24 and the \"uncoupled\" translocation is the \u00fe3 translocation (i.e., the downstream translocation of the ribosome by 3 nucleotides along the mRNA). According to this model, for the AAG(AAA) mutant, i.e., changing AAG 27 codon to AAA 27 (Fig. 5a) , after the \"uncoupled\" translocation the peptidyl-tRNA Lys (AAA 24 ) codon pair is in the P site and the AAA 27 codon is in the A site that is now available for aminoacyl-tRNA binding. Since whether after the \u00c0 1 slippage or not the codon in the A site is always AAA, both the AAA 26 codon ( \u00c0 1 frame) and AAA 27 codon (0 frame) have the same interaction energy with the aminoacyl-tRNA Lys . Thus, it would be expected that in the pathway of the \"uncoupled\" translocation ( Fig. S1 ), the probability of the translation in 0 frame should be larger than or at least equal to that of the translation in \u00c01 frame. However, this is inconsistent with the experimental data [29] , as discussed below. The experimental data [29] showed that for the WT mRNA about F UT \u00bc71-75% fraction of the elongating ribsosmes proceed in the pathway of the \"uncoupled\" translocation (with 71% of elongating ribosomes exhibiting 4 4 Cy5-tRNA Lsy pulses or with the frameshifting percentage of about 75%) and for the AAG(AAA) mutant mRNA the -1 frameshifting percentage is about F FS \u00bc49%. Since for both the WT mRNA and AAG(AAA) mutant, the elongating ribosomes should have the same fraction (F UT \u00bc71-75%) that proceed in the pathway of the \"uncoupled\" translocation, it is thus expected that for the AAG (AAA) mutant the non-frameshifting percentage is about F NF \u00bcF UT \u00c0 F FS \u00bc 22-26% in the pathway of the \"uncoupled\" translocation. In other words, in the pathway of the \"uncoupled\" translocation, about 22-26% ribosomes that enter the stalled state do not frameshift, while the experimental data [29] showed that about 49% ribosomes that enter the stalled state frameshift, with the former being about 2-fold smaller than the latter. This is inconsistent with the deduction from the experimental data showing that for the AAG(AAA) mutant, in the pathway of the \"uncoupled\" translocation, the probability of the translation in 0 frame should be larger than or at least equal to that of the translation in \u00c0 1 frame (see just above). The inconsistency thus argues against the \u00fe3 translocation proposal.",

For other mutant sequences such as the AAG(UUU) mutant (changing AAG 27 to UUU 27 ) and AAG(AAC) mutant (changing AAG 27 to AAC 27 ) with the codon for \u00c0 1 frame in the A site being different from the codon for 0 frame (Fig. 5a) , the two codons have different interaction energies with their corresponding cognate tRNAs, which plays an important role in determining the probability of the translation in 0 frame and that of the translation in \u00c01 frame in the pathway of the \u00fe2 translocation (Fig. 4) . This could provide an explanation of the experimental data in Chen et al. [29] . For the WT sequence, the AAA 26 codon ( \u00c0 1 frame) has the larger interaction strength with the UUU anticodon of the aminoacyl-tRNA Lys than the AAG 27 codon (0 frame). Thus, the probability of the translation in \u00c01 frame is expected to be much larger than that of the translation in 0 frame in the pathway of the \u00fe2 translocation. For the AAG(AAA) mutant, the same AAA codon for \u00c0 1 frame and 0 frame give the same interaction energy with the UUU anticodon of the aminoacyl-tRNA Lys , inducing the probability of the translation in \u00c0 1 frame to be smaller than that for the WT sequence. For the AAG (UUU) mutant, the further reduction of the probability of the translation in \u00c0 1 frame relative to that for the AAG(AAA) mutant [29] could be due to the fact that the UUU 27 codon (0 frame) has a stronger interaction than the AUU 26 codon ( \u00c0 1 frame) with their corresponding cognate tRNAs.",

The available biochemical data showed that the binding rate of a near-cognate tRNA is similar to that of the cognate tRNA to the A site of the ribosome [63, 64] . Thus, for the AAG(UUU) mutant, it is expected that after the \u00fe2 translocation at codon AAA 24 , the arrival time of the near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA Phe to the A-site AUU 26 codon (\u00c0 1 frame) would be similar to that of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA Lys to the A-site AAA 26 codon ( \u00c0 1 frame) for the WT sequence. Consequently, after the \u00fe2 translocation the tRNA Phe arrival time for the AAG(UUU) mutant could be similar to tRNA Lys arrival time for the WT sequence. Moreover, for the AAG(UUU) mutant, after the binding of tRNA Phe to the A-site AUU 26 codon ( \u00c01 frame) the stronger interaction of the AAA anticodon of tRNA Phe with the UUU codon induces slippage of the two tRNAs to the 0 frames. Consequently, after the \u00fe2 translocation at codon AAA 24 the mean lifetime of tRNA Phe sampling for the AAG(UUU) mutant could be also similar to that of tRNA Lys sampling for the WT sequence. In addition, for Cy5-tRNA Lys transit through the AAG(UUU) mutant, because both the sampling of cognate tRNA Ile to the A-site AUU 26 codon ( \u00c0 1 frame) and the sampling of cognate tRNA Phe to the A-site UUU 27 codon (0 frame) are invisible, only three Lys pulses can be observed, consistent with the experimental data [29] . For Cy5-tRNA Lys transit through the AAG(AAC) mutant, after the \u00fe2 translocation at codon AAA 24 , because the binding rate of the nearcognate tRNA Asn to the A-site AAA 26 codon ( \u00c0 1 frame) is similar to the cognate tRNA Lys to the A-site AAA 26 codon, about half fraction of Cy5-tRNA Lys samplings to the A-site AAA 26 codon can occur. On the other hand, the \u00fe2 translocation contains about 71% fraction of the total translocations [29] . Thus, it is estimated that the probability of observing more than three Lys pulses is about 35%, which is slightly larger than the experimental data of about 25% [29] . Assuming that the Cy5-labeling may reduce the tRNA binding rate, it is expected that the probability of observing more than three Lys pulses is slightly smaller than 35% estimated above.",

Thus, from Eq. (6) we note that k 23 \u00bbk 22 . This implies that the third term in the right-hand side of Eq. (11) is much smaller than the other two terms. Moreover, rate constants k 20 , k 21 , k 22 and k 23 are independent of the concentrations of EF-G.GTP and the ternary complex (see Fig. 4 ). Thus, Eq. (11) implies that the mean lifetime T tRNA remains constant at the various factor concentrations, which is also consistent with the single-molecule experimental data (Extended Data Fig. 8c in Chen et al.

            "text": "It was well characterized that after the peptidyl transfer and before EF-G.GTP binding, the pretranslocation ribosomal complex can transit spontaneously between the non-rotated and rotated states, with the two states being in thermodynamic equilibrium and the majority being in the rotated states [37] [38] [39] . In other words, at low concentration of EF-G.GTP (r480 nM) as used in the experiments of Chen et al. [29] , after transition to the rotated state the ribosome can occasionally transit backward to the nonrotated state and then rapidly transit forward to the rotated state again before the slow binding of EF-G.GTP. However, it was observed in the experiments that after transition to the rotated state the ribosome is kept in the rotated state in the long period before EF-G.GTP binding [29] , implying that the short-lived non-rotated state that occurs after the occasional backward transition from the rotated state cannot be resolved from the FRET signal in the experiments [29] . Thus, in the analysis in this work focusing on the explanation of the experimental data of Chen et al. [29] we neglect the backward transition from State H0 to State C0 (see Fig. 1 ). In addition, previous single-molecule experimental data of the same group [50] showed that the binding rate of EF-G.GTP to the nonrotated state is about 0.84 \u03bc \u2212 \u2212 M s 1 1 , giving the rate constant k 1 o 0.4 \u2212 s 1 at [EF-G] r 480 nM (see Fig. 1 ). By contrast, the smFRET data of the same group [68] showed the rate constant k 01 42 \u2212 s 1 . Thus, in the analysis in this work we neglect the transition from State C0 to State C and only consider the transition from State C0 to State H0.",

Since EF-G.GDP facilitates the transition of the non-rotated state to rotated state and then stabilizes the rotated state [40, 41] , it is thus expected that the rate constants k 14 and k 16 are larger than k 01 , implying that the lifetimes of State FC and State LP are shorter than State C0. As mentioned above, before EF-G.GTP binding State H0 can occasionally transit backward to State C0, but the short lifetime of State C0 cannot be resolved from the FRET signal in the experiments of Chen et al.

By contrast, for the mutant mRNAs such as the AAG(AAA) and AAG (UUU), not all the ribosomes that enter into the long-paused rotated state show frameshifing (see Section 3.2) and thus, there are two populations for the non-frameshifted ribosomes: one without the long pause and another one with a long pause that remains in the 0 frame, which is consistent with the experimental data [29] .",

Moreover, we consider an external force, F, pulling the mRNA by fixing the body of the 30S subunit. The force can be easily realized by using in vitro optical trapping assays (single trap or dual traps), as described below. In the single-trapping assay, the 30S body of the translating ribosome is fixed to a solid surface, while the end of the downstream mRNA is attached to a micrometer-sized bead held in the trap. Note that the residues on the 30S body which are fixed to the solid surface should be far away from the mRNA channel, so that the fixing has no effect on the translation activity such as the binding of the ternary complex, codon recognition, mRNA translocation and deacylated tRNA dissociation, etc. We can alternatively use the dual-trapping assay, where the 30S body of the translating ribosome is attached to a micrometer-sized bead held in a trap of strong strength, while the end of the downstream mRNA is attached to a micrometer-sized bead held in another trap of weak strength. Based on our model (Fig. 3) , under the external force F the occurrence probability of State LP at one slippery sequence which is caused by one reverse intersubunit rotation is calculated by [see With Eqs.

            "text": "It is noted that our model can also explain the more recent experimental data that were obtained using the PURExpress in vitro translation system by Yan et al. [30] , as discussed below. Based on our model, under large resistance to the forward mRNA translocation arising from the unwinding of the downstream mRNA base pairs and disruption of the upstream SD-antiSD interaction, the codon-anticodon interaction has a large probability to disrupt by reverse intersubunit rotation that occurs after the ribosomal unlocking, as calculations showed before [28] . After the disruption of the codon-anticodon interaction and the SD-antiSD interaction, two scenarios can be expected to occur, with the occurrence probability dependent on the experimental condition. The first and prevalent one in the cell is that the anticodon of the peptidyl-tRNA immediately forms pairing with codon XXX immediately adjacent to codon XXY (see Fig. 3 ). This leads to entering into State LP, which corresponds to the experiments of Chen et al. [29] . The other scenario is that the anticodon of the peptidyl-tRNA does not rapidly form pairing with another codon that is cognate to the anticodon of the peptidyl-tRNA. The ribosome-tRNA complex then moves randomly relative to the mRNA by the thermal noise until the reformation of the codon-anticodon and SD-antiSD base pairs and then the decoding of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site (during the period the ribosome-tRNA complex having the fixed conformation of the non-rotated 30S head and no intersubunit rotation). This scenario corresponds to the experiments that were conducted using the PURExpress in vitro translation system by Yan et al. [30] , showing that multiple translocation excursions occur around the slippery sequence, where both the base-pairing interaction of the downstream mRNA and the upstream SD and antiSD interaction are present, and the ribosome can frameshift from various codon positions around the slippery sequence region. Moreover, it is expected that without the codonanticodon and SD-antiSD interactions the tRNA can dissociate easily from the ribosome, prematurely terminating the translation, which is also consistent with the experimental data of Yan et al. [30] . Note also that without immediate formation of the codonanticodon interactions, the bending of the peptidyl-tRNA would not occur and thus the long paused state would not occur. This is also consistent with the experimental data of Yan et al. [30] .",

It this proposal is true, it would be expected that during the normal translation, no net mRNA movement can occur by a round of the 30S head rotations (the forward and backward rotations) because at the end of a round of the 30S head rotations or in the posttranslocation state both the 30S body and 30S head are in the non-rotated conformations.
