Among 50 randomly picked clones, 12 Fabs specially reacted with S protein by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The microneutralizing test showed that one clone, designated M1A, had neutralizing activity on Vero E6 cells against SARS-CoV. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the light-and heavy-chain genes of M1A Fab belong to the 2a and 4f families, respectively. A neutralizing test on purified M1A demonstrated that 0.5 mg/ml of M1A completely inhibited SARS-CoV activity, with an absence of cytopathic effect for 7 days. Real-time fluorescence reverse transcription-PCR also proved the neutralizing capacity of M1A. These data showed that the number of virus copies was significantly reduced in the M1A-treated group, suggesting an important role for M1A in passive immunoprophylaxis against the SARS virus.",

Previous studies showed SARS patients could make great progress if they were given serum from convalescent SARS patients, indicating that generation of a human monoclonal antibody (MAb) against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be helpful for passive immunoprophylaxis against SARS virus (8) . The spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV is an important target for neutralizing antibody (9) . We constructed a human antibody library by the phage display technique and used the S protein of SARS-CoV as the target to screen the phage antibody library. This study describes the generation of one neutralizing SARS-CoV-specific human antibody Fab molecule by panning selection of combinatorial Fab libraries against S proteins and quantitative analysis of the binding and neutralizing activity of the Fab molecules.",

The eluted phages were amplified by infection of Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cultures, followed by superinfection with helper phage VCS M13 (10 12 PFU).

Then total RNAs of a virus control group and a test group with M1A (0.5 mg/ml) were isolated from aliquots of culture supernatants, from the first day to the sixth day after virus infection. The realtime RT-PCR assay was performed by following the operation instructions for the novel coronavirus PCR fluorescence diagnostic kit (Piji Biological Co.), and amplification conditions were 42\u00b0C for 30 min and 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 5 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 60 s, and then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s.

A linear standard curve was obtained by subjecting known amounts of SARS-CoV RNA to real-time RT-PCR. The result indicated that as the amount of input RNA increased, the C T required to reach the threshold for fluorescence detection decreased, so a linear relationship was found between the C T and the RNA copy number determined (correlation coefficient [r], 0.99), as shown in Fig. 4 , indicating the accuracy of this assay.
