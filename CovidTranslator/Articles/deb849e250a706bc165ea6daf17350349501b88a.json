Both the disease and the fear of disease have had considerable economic and social impacts, with restrictions on international travel enforced by several countries, the quarantining of tens of millions of people, dramatic drops in tourism, and disruption of supply chains for food, medicines, and manufactured products.

Disease emergence correlates with human population density and wildlife diversity, and is driven by anthropogenic changes such as deforestation and expansion of agricultural land (i.e., land-use change), intensification of livestock production, and increased hunting and trading of wildlife (13, 14) . For example, the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998 was causally linked to intensification of pig production at the edge of tropical forests where the fruit bat reservoirs live; the origins of SARS and Ebola viruses have been traced back to bats that are hunted (SARS) or inhabit regions under increasing human development (Ebola). Mitigating the underlying drivers of disease emergence will therefore require consideration of multiple dimensions of socioeconomic development, which include SDGs targeting a diverse range of societal issues (Fig. 1) .",

Given the direct connection between environmental change and EID risk, actions taken to achieve other SDGs will have an impact on the achievement of Goal 3 (either positive or negative). The strongest links can be expected with Goals 2 and 15. Goal 2 aims to increase agricultural productivity to enhance global food security, which will likely lead to the expansion and/or intensification of cropping and livestock production systems (both increasing EID risk). Goal 15 aims to conserve the world's terrestrial ecosystems, with direct implications for EID risk mitigation given the prominent role that habitat loss plays in driving the transmission of pathogens.",
