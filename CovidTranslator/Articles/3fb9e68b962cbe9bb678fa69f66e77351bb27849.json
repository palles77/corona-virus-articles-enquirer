We hypothesized that recent improvements in immunosuppressive treatment may reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This study aimed to investigate transitional changes in the incidence of OFNH among renal transplant recipients by MRI. Methods: Participants comprised 110 patients who had undergone renal transplantation from 2003 to 2012, during which time basiliximab was in regular use at our institute (Recent group), and 232 patients who had undergone RT between 1986 and 2003 (Past group). We compared ONFH incidence between the two groups and evaluated risk factors for ONFH, including immunosuppressants (calcineurin inhibitors, basiliximab, and/or steroids) and postoperative renal function. Results: Incidence of ONFH was lower in the Recent group (0%) than in the Past group (3.4%; p \u00bc 0.043). In the Recent group, age was greater, ABO/human leukocyte antigen incompatibility was worse, while steroid dose was decreased and post-transplant renal function was improved. Cumulative methylprednisolone dose at postoperative week 2 and delayed graft function were identified as risk factors for ONFH. Conclusion: Risk of ONFH after renal transplantation has fallen with the advent of regular use of basiliximab, although this agent does not appear to be a factor directly associated with the incidence of ONFH. Study design: Clinical prognostic study (Level III case control study).",

During the period, 155 patients underwent RT. The Past group included 232 patients (143 men, 89 women; mean age, 34 \u00b1 13 years; mean BMI, 21.9 \u00b1 3.4 kg/ m 2 ) who had undergone RT between January 1986 and March 2003 (i.e., prior to the regular use of basiliximab).

All patients were notified about the reported incidences of ONFH after RT, benefits and risks of MRI, and possible treatment options, and given the opportunity to object. MRI was performed 3 months after RT using either a 1.0-T superconducting magnet system (SIGNA Horizon LX 1.0T; General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), or one of two 1.5-T superconducting magnet systems (SMT150X; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan or Achieva 1.5T A-series; Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Osteonecrosis was defined as an area of normal intensity demarcated by a low-intensity band on T1-weighted imaging [16] . T1-weighted spin-echo images were obtained using a 1.5-T system in the coronal and sagittal planes, with the following settings: repetition time (TR), 500e800 ms; echo time (TE), 12e43 ms; and slice thickness, 2e10 mm. Spoiled gradient-recalled echo pulse sequences were obtained using the 1.0-T system in the coronal plane with the following settings: TR, 4.5e14 ms; TE, 1.84e3.08 ms; flip angle, 30 ; and slice thickness, 1.0e1.5 mm with no interslice gap.",

PSL-equivalent doses were calculated by adjusting the MPSL dose on the basis of antiinflammatory potency, using a conversion factor of 1.25. Acute transplant rejection was diagnosed as follows: a 40% increase in BUN or a 20% increase in Cr level compared with those at a previous sampling, daily urinary output 750 ml, and diagnosis by biopsy.

            "text": "Improvements in post-transplant renal function and reductions in corticosteroid dose may have led to a decrease in the incidence of ONFH [1e4]. Renal graft function after RT has been improving with advances in immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine A [2, 17] and tacrolimus [12e14] . Several other immunosuppressive agents including sirolimus, everolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and basiliximab have been introduced in combination with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus and have also improved postoperative renal function [18] . In contrast, few reports have been published about the influence of these new immunosuppressive agents on the incidence of ONFH after RT. Basiliximab, an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, is a very strong immunosuppressive agent that exerts its effects through competitive interleukin-2 antagonism [19] . When administered as an induction therapy during the early postoperative period, in conjunction with one or more conventional immunosuppressive drugs, decreases in the incidences of acute transplant rejection and DGF and improvements in survival of the transplanted kidney have been reported [12e15] . Decreases in steroid and calcineurin inhibitor doses have also been reported [15, 20, 21] . These marked changes in immunosuppressive treatments and postoperative renal function may have reduced the incidence of ONFH. The proportion of ONFH patients receiving steroid treatment for renal transplantation has reportedly decreased recently according to the multicenter hospital-based sentinel monitoring system for ONFH in Japan [22] , although the reasons for these decreases in the proportion of ONFH patients receiving renal transplantation remain unclear. In addition, only a small number of reports since 2001 have described MRI screening for ONFH after RT, and the impact of the introduction of basiliximab on the post-transplant incidence of ONFH has yet to be determined. We therefore investigated the incidence of ONFH since the advent of regular basiliximab use and found that postoperative renal graft function had improved, and the MPSL dose and incidence of DGF as risk factors for ONFH had decreased. In addition, the incidence of ONFH had decreased. Basiliximab seems likely to indirectly reduce the incidence of ONFH by reducing the incidence of DGF and allowing reductions in MPSL administration.",

First, the number of renal transplant recipients with use of basiliximab might be too small to evaluate its effect on the incidence of ONFH. The number of patients included in previous MRI screening studies ranged from 26 to 150 [3,5e10] , so the number of patients in the present study is comparable with the numbers in those studies. Second, MRI screening was not performed before RT, so we could not be sure that ONFH had not been present prior to transplantation. Nevertheless, because the incidence of ONFH in our study was lower than that in any previous study evaluated using MRI, the incidence was presumed to have also been low even before transplantation. Third, the timing of MRI screening was earlier compared to other MRI screening studies. This might be one reason the incidence of ONFH at our institute was lower than described in other reports performed during a similar period. We did not encounter any symptomatic cases with ONFH in which MRI had been negative at 3 months after RT, so we considered that the incidence of ONFH occurring after 3 months after RT was unlikely to have been particularly high.",

In previous MRI screening studies of ONFH after RT performed between 1986 and 2001 without the use of basiliximab, incidences of ONFH after RT were within the range of 3.4e25.4% [3,5e10] . Although a downward trend was observed in those studies, no MRI screening studies for ONFH have been reported since 2002, and the present study showed the lowest incidence of ONFH after RT among all relevant studies (Table 5) .",

The results showed that DGF and cumulative MPSL administration up to 2 weeks after RT were significant risk factors. Other risk factors for ONFH reported after RT include daily oral steroid dose, BUN level 2 months after RT, accumulated steroid dose at 2 months, accumulated steroid dose at 2 weeks, ethnicity (African-American), history of peritoneal dialysis, rejection, delayed graft function, and cyclosporine A administration [1,10,11,23e25] . To date, cumulative steroid dose as of 2 weeks postoperatively has been reported as the shortest-term risk factor for ONFH [24] . The risk factors for ONFH after RT in the present study were in accordance with past findings. This result suggests that ONFH occurs mostly within the first 2 weeks after RT, suggesting the importance of controlling postoperative graft function and reducing cumulative MPSL administration in the first 2 weeks after RT using immunosuppressive agents that are appropriate for the prevention of ONFH.",

No evidence of a significant correlation between cumulative corticosteroid dose and incidence of ONFH has yet been provided [26, 27] . In renal transplant recipients, daily steroid dose is gradually tapered according to the immunosuppressive regimen, so reflecting an overall picture of steroid treatment using a mean value for daily steroid dose is difficult. In addition, duration of steroid treatment and overall cumulative steroid dose vary widely among renal recipients, and steroid administration after onset of ONFH might be included in the regression analysis. We therefore focused on the correlation between steroid administration including oral steroid administration and pulsed steroid therapy in the 8 weeks after renal transplantation and onset of ONFH at 3 months.",
