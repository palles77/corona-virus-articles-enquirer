By using PC2 activity, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and Western blot method, PC2, CPE and preproNPY protein expression levels were compared among mature retina tissue, RGC-5 cells and its differentiated cells, or brain cortex tissue, NS20Y tumor cells and its differentiated cells, or mature breast tissue, breast tumor cell RM1 and breast adenocarcinoma tissue. The experimental results indicated that the differentiated cells or tissues had higher or highest PC2 activity. In the comparative experiments, more PC2 protein expression in the mature tissues and more CPE and preproNPY protein expression in the tumor cells or tumor tissue were observed, but no expression of preproNPY protein was observed in the mature tissues. Compared with NS20Y or RGC-5 undifferentiated cells, its differentiated cells showed less proPC2, more proCPE and more preproNPY protein expressions. The results demonstrated that the mature tissues showed stronger PC2/CPE-mediated pro-protein processing ability than the tumor cells or tissue. The results also showed that the artificial differentiation of RGC-5 or NS20Y cells was different from maturation of its corresponding normal tissue.",

            "text": "Subtilisin-like pro-protein convertases (PCs) are the major endoproteolytic processing enzymes that mediate the biosynthesis of a great variety of secreted and membrane proteins. These proteins processed by PCs are involved in embryogenesis, gene expression, cell cycle, programmed cell death, intracellular protein targeting, and endocrine/neural functions (Zhou et al., 1999; Muller et al., 2004) . These precursor molecules need to undergo a series of processing steps that involve multiple processing enzymes (Posthaus et al., 2003; Chan et al., 1992) . The multi-protein family of mammalian serine proteases is responsible for these proteolytic maturation events. They are expressed together or separately in functional cells from both vertebrates and invertebrates. The mammalian PCs have been demonstrated to be involved in several diseases, i.e. HIV, hepatitis B, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), anthrax, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, stroke, glaucoma, and diabetes (Seidah and Prat, 2002; Thomas, 2002; Khatib et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2003; Molloy et al., 1999; Leak et al., 2007) .",

Tanaka (2003) and Sang-Nam et al. (2007) reported that mouse or rat proPC2 with 637 amino acid residues (74 kDa) cleaves into mature PC2 with 529 amino acid residues (64 kDa) in adequate conditions, such as 5.0 pH, higher Ca 2+ , and other PCs. There is about 96.55% identity between human and mouse PC2, or 99.53% identity between mouse and rat PC2 in amino acid sequence (Smeekens and Steiner, 1990; Seidah et al., 1991; Manser et al., 1990) . Fricker et al. (1989) and Hakes et al. (1991) reported that the human and rat proCPE protein sequence with 476 amino acid residues (56 kDa) are highly conserved (99.58% identity between them). The mature CPE protein is about 50 kDa. The soluble CPE (sCPE) is an exo-peptidase that cleaves neuroendocrinopeptide with Cterminal basic amino acid residue and produces active form of peptide hormone and neuropeptide (Fricker and Snyder, 1983; Hook and Loh, 1984) . The membrane-bound CPE (mCPE) functions as a sorting receptor in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). It facilitates the sorting of pro-hormones into the regulated secretary pathway (Zhu et al., 2005; Dhanvantari et al., 2003) . Brakch et al. (1997) and Miller et al. (2003) In our previous study on neurons and ischemia, we discovered the artificial differentiation of NS20Y or RGC-5 tumor cells caused the increase of PC2 activity. There may seem certain relationship between the PC system and tumor differentiation. The PC2/CPE-mediated processing system in the tumor cells and their corresponding mature tissues was evaluated in the paper.",

NPY molecule is one of the most abundant peptides found in the mammalian tissue (Chronwall et al., 1985; De Quidt and Emson, 1986) . Its maturation is subjected to the processing of PC2 and CPE. preproNPY has 97 amino acid residues in mouse and human, 98 amino acid residues in rat. The isoelectric point (pI) of preproNPY is 11.1. The Western blot result of preproNPY peptide indicated that its specific band on SDS-PAGE was close to 17 kDa, which is because the higher pI of the peptide formed a larger molecule by combining with more SDS molecule. The electric mobility is very similar with the GHRH analogs we ever reported (Tang et al., 2004) . In the study on PC2 activity, the leupeptin in the Berman buffer strongly inhibits PC2 activity and there is lower PC2 activity in the tumor cells.

As long as intracellular proNPY protein occurs, the strong PC2/CPE-mediated processing system processes the precursor into NPY, whereas the weak PC2/CPE-mediated pro-protein processing level in the tumor tissues or cells leads to the aggregations of proCPE and preproNPY proteins. In the research the cell or tissue ICC results collaborated with the Western blot ones. We predict that there is a weak or uneven PCs system in tumor. The microenvironment formed in tumor was different from normal mature tissue. So the profile of tumor may result from not only up-or down-regulation(s) of component(s), but also the difference of the construct ratio of the functional molecules in tumor tissue should be considered. We predict that the increase of PC2 activity in tumor cell may induce its differentiation.",
