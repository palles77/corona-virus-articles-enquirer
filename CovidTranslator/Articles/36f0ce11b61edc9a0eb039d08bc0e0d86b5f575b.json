Horses that become dehydrated in endurance rides may refuse to drink, and the administration of water by oral intubation and enemas may be necessary. In cattle on pasture and deprived of water for up to 9 days and then given access to water, there will be staggering, falling, convulsions, and some death-signs similar to salt poisoning in pigs. Experimental restriction of the water intake in lactating dairy cattle for up to 4 days may reduce milk yield by 75% and decrease BW by 14%. A 10% reduction in water intake causes a drop in milk production that may be difficult to detect. Behavioral changes are obvious: cows spend considerable time licking the water bowls. In cold climates, cattle are often forced to eat snow as a source of water. The snow must be soft enough so that it can be scooped up by the cattle and 3 to 5 days are necessary for the animals to adjust to the absence of water and become dependent on snow.

In calves with acute diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli the sodium concentration of the intestinal fluid secreted in response to the enterotoxin is similar to that of plasma, and hyponatremia usually occurs (hypotonic dehydration). Animals affected with diarrhea of several days' duration continue to lose large quantities of sodium, and the hyponatremia may become severe. Hyponatremia can become severe when sodium-free water or 5% dextrose are used as the only fluid therapy in animals already hyponatremic. Hyponatremia can also occur in animals with proximal tubular dysfunction. Hyponatremia causes an increase in the renal excretion of water in an attempt to maintain normal osmotic pressure, which results in a decrease in the extracellular fluid space, leading to a decreased circulating blood volume, hypotension, peripheral circulatory failure, and ultimately renal failure.

Too rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia (defined as hyponatremia >48 hours) should be avoided because of the potential for demyelination of pontine and extrapontine neurons that can produce severe neurologic deficits. These deficits are not well described in agricultural animals, but in humans, rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia has been associated with improvement of neurologic abnormalities within 1 to 2 days, followed by the development of progressive ataxia, dysphagia, myoclonus, spastic tetraparesis, and death within 2 to 5 days.

            "text": "Hypernatremia is most commonly caused by water restriction or mixing errors in neonatal animals, particularly in milk-replacer solutions or oral electrolyte formulations administered to neonatal calves with diarrhea as part of the treatment of dehydration. Hypernatremia appears to be increasing in North America in dairy calves fed milk replacer because milk-replacer formulations are increasingly dependent on whey from cheese manufacture, and whey has a high sodium concentration. Less common causes of hypernatremia include high-salinity water. 2 Hypernatremia occurs transiently after hypertonic saline (7.2% NaCl) administration, but serum sodium concentrations never exceed 170 mEq/L and may occasionally exceed 160 mEq/L for a few minutes. Transient episodes of mild hypernatremia caused by intravenous hypertonic saline administration are not thought to have any clinical consequences. Clinically relevant hypernatremia occurs when serum sodium concentrations exceed 160 mEq/L, with significant mortality occurring whenever serum sodium concentrations exceed 180 to 190 mEq/L before treatment is instituted. The clinical signs of hypernatremia are nonspecific and include weakness, depression, inappetence, abnormal posture, recumbency, apparent blindness, and muscle twitching, particularly of the facial muscles ( Fig. 5-6 ). Some animals may convulse shortly before death. Cerebral depression is caused by inhibition of neuronal cell glycolysis. Less severely affected animals may exhibit a mania for water. Hypernatremia has been associated with persistent hyperglycemia in New World camelids, in which it has been assumed that hyperglycemia-induced diuresis has resulted in excessive free water loss with inadequate water intake. Acute gastric dilatation, dilatation and impaction or volvulus of abomasum, acute high intestinal obstruction Increased strong ion difference Strong ion (metabolic) alkalosis weakness and paradoxical aciduria. Hypokalemia causes muscle weakness by lowering the resting potential of membranes, resulting in decreased excitability of neuromuscular tissue. Thus the differential diagnosis of the animal with muscle weakness should always include hypokalemia. Hypokalemia and alkalemia also are often directly related because of the renal response to either. Hypokalemia from true body deficits of potassium will cause decreased intracellular concentration of this ion. The intracellular deficit of potassium and excess of hydrogen will cause hydrogen secretion into the urine when distal sodium reabsorption is required. This situation exists in alkalemia and metabolic alkalosis, in which sodium bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal nephron is decreased because of the excess of plasma bicarbonate. Distal nephron avidity for sodium is increased to protect extracellular fluid volume, and the increased distal sodium reabsorption is at the expense of hydrogen secretion, although it is contrary to the need of acid retention in the presence of alkalosis. In other words, the kidney prioritizes maintenance of plasma volume above that of acid-base balance, presumably because respiratory compensation can usually keep blood pH within the normal physiologic range. Because electroneutrality of extracellular fluid must be maintained by displaced abomasum (LDA), right displaced abomasum (RDA), abomasal volvulus (AV), abomasal impaction, clinical mastitis, dystocia, retained placenta, and hepatic lipidosis. 4 The high prevalence of hypokalemia in sick lactating dairy cows is most likely caused by a combination of decreased dry matter intake; alkalemia from sequestration of chloride in the gastrointestinal tract in cattle with LDA, RDA, AV, or decreased abomasal emptying rate; hyperinsulinemia secondary to hyperglycemia; 5,6 the obligatory loss of potassium in milk (1.4 g of potassium per liter of milk); sympathetic nervous system activation; aldosterone release in response to hypovolemia and the need for sodium retention; and decreased whole-body potassium stores caused by the relatively low muscle mass in dairy cows. Whole-body depletion of potassium may be present in healthy dairy cattle immediately after calving, based on the results of potassium balance studies, studies documenting decreased skeletal muscle potassium content at calving, and decreased urine potassium concentrations immediately after calving. A low serum potassium concentration was a significant predictor of nonsurvival in cattle undergoing surgical correction of LDA or treatment of hepatic lipidosis. 4 Metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia in cattle are often accompanied by muscular HYPOKALEMIA Hypokalemia may occur as a result of decreased dietary intake, increased renal excretion, abomasal stasis, intestinal obstruction and enteritis, and repeated administration of corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity (Fig. 5-8) . The prolonged use of potassium-free solutions in fluid therapy for diarrheic animals may result in excessive renal excretion of potassium and hypokalemia. Calves with neonatal diarrhea can have marked depletion of their body potassium stores, particularly when a marked acidemia and metabolic acidosis is present, and the calves have had a low milk intake and a long history of diarrhea. 3 Alkalosis may result in an exchange of potassium ions for hydrogen ions in the renal tubular fluid, resulting in hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness, prolonged unexplained recumbency, inability to hold up the head, anorexia, muscular tremors and, if severe enough, coma. The treatment of ketosis in lactating dairy cows with multiple dosages of isoflupredone, a glucocorticoid with some mineralocorticoid activity, can cause hypokalemia and recumbency, with a high case fatality rate.",

Rumen fluid in cattle usually has a potassium concentration of 24 to 85 mEq/L, and rumen fluid potassium concentration and potassium absorption are strongly and linearly dependent on potassium intake. This indicates that increasing rumen potassium concentration by the oral administration of KCl will directly lead to increased potassium absorption. Oral administration of KCl therefore provides the optimal salt formulation for treating cattle with hypokalemia because potassium is needed in cattle with whole-body potassium depletion, and chloride is needed in cattle with alkalemia and pH-induced compartmental shift of potassium to the intracellular space. 7 Current treatment recommendations are to administer 120 g of feed grade KCl orally twice at a 12-hour interval to inappetent dairy cattle with hypokalemia, providing a total 24-hour dose of 240 g of KCl; this dose is equivalent to a daily KCl dose of 0.4 g/kg BW for a 600-kg dairy cow. 4, 7 Daily oral doses of KCl exceeding 0.4 g/kg BW are not currently recommended, except in cattle with profound hypokalemia, because they have the potential to result in diarrhea, excessive salivation, muscular tremors of the legs, labored breathing, convulsions, and death. 4, 7 Oral administration of 0.58 g of KCl/kg BW was toxic in 6-month-old Holstein calves, manifested by excessive salivation, muscular tremors of the legs and excitability, and a peak plasma potassium concentration of 9.0 mEq/L.

Extremely low plasma or serum concentrations or high concentrations are usually indicative of a potassium imbalance often associated with other electrolyte and acid-base imbalances. In alkalemia, for example, potassium leaves the extracellular space and becomes concentrated in the cells. This may result in low serum potassium concentrations when there might not be potassium depletion of the body. Conversely, in severe acidemia and metabolic acidosis of calves with acute diarrhea, the potassium leaves the cells and moves into the extracellular fluid. This results in hyperkalemia in some cases in which the body potassium is normal or even decreased. When changes occur in the concentration of intracellular and extracellular potassium, the ratio of intracellular to extracellular potassium may decrease by as much as 30% to 50%, which results in a decrease in the resting membrane potential.

Calcium can be administered intravenously at 0.2 to 0.4 mL of a 23% calcium gluconate solution/kg BW. In summary, the focus of treatment in hyperkalemia should be optimizing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate by plasma volume expansion, correction of acidemia, and increasing the serum sodium concentration.

Thus potassium is supposedly exchanged with hydrogen ions across the cell membrane to maintain electroneutrality. Although widely accepted, this purported mechanism has never had a sound physicochemical basis because a decrease in plasma pH from 7.4 to 7.0 (equivalent to an increase in plasma hydrogen ion activity from 40 to 100 nEq/L) would decrease plasma [K] from 7.0 to 6.99994 mEq/L on the basis of electrochemical exchange of cations. Not only is such a decrease physiologically irrelevant, but the decrease is undetectable using current laboratory equipment. 8 An attractive hypothesis for the development of hyperkalemia in acidemic animals is that the low intracellular pH slows Na-K-ATPase activity causing potassium ions to leak down a concentration gradient from the intracellular to the extracellular space; however, there is no experimental data indicating that Na-K-ATPase activity is directly influenced by pH within the physiologic range. Low intracellular pH does exert a marked effect on phosphofructokinase activity in the glycolytic pathway; with Na-K-ATPase activity dependent on ATP availability, decreased phosphofructokinase activity presents a potential pathway for acidemia-induced hyperkalemia. Hampered insulin-dependent cellular potassium uptake in states of acidemia presents a second potential mechanism for the association between hyperkalemia and acidemia; mild declines in blood pH can induce insulin resistance. Because insulin triggers a transcellular shift of glucose and potassium, tissue resistance to insulin has the potential to contribute to hyperkalemia. A third potential mechanism for acidemiainduced hyperkalemia is activation of a cell membrane potassium channel called TREK-1 by low intracellular pH, resulting in potassium efflux from the cell. 8 An interesting recent finding is that hyperkalemia is much less common in neonatal calves with acidemia caused by hyper d-lactatemia than in calves with acidemia and plasma dlactate concentrations within the reference interval. 9 Hyperkalemia is potentially more lifethreatening than hypokalemia. Hyperkalemia (when over 7-8 mmol/L) has a profound effect on cardiac function. There is usually marked bradycardia and arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac arrest may occur. Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes in experimentally induced hyperkalemia in the horse have been described. The changes include four successive stages as hyperkalemia increased. There was a widening and lowering of amplitude followed by inversion and disappearance of the P wave; an increase in the amplitude of the T wave; an increase in the QRS interval, with some irregularity in the ventricular rate; and periods of cardiac arrest that became terminal or were followed by ventricular fibrillation. The minimum sodium phosphate; this result may have been caused by formation of calcium-phosphate complexes in the rumen. 12 Calcium chloride has the advantage of low cost and low volume (because of its high solubility), but CaCl 2 can severely damage the pharynx and esophagus in ruminants with reduced swallowing ability, can lead to necrosis of the forestomach and abomasum when administered in high doses, and can lead to aspiration pneumonia when administered as a drench. Calcium propionate has the advantage that it is less irritating than CaCl 2 while providing a gluconeogenic substrate (propionate), but the disadvantages of calcium propionate are higher volumes and cost. Oral calcium solutions should only be administered to cattle that have normal swallowing ability, precluding their administration to animals with advanced clinical signs of hypocalcemia. Higher plasma calcium concentrations are obtained more quickly when calcium solutions are drenched after administration of vasopressin to induce esophageal groove closure, or when the calcium solution is administered as a drench instead of ororuminal intubation. Calcium solutions are suspected to have a higher likelihood of aspiration pneumonia than calcium gels (with a consistency similar to toothpaste), although this supposition does not appear to have been verified. Commercially available formulations of calcium gels contain 50 g of CaCl 2 and increase plasma calcium concentrations within 30 to 60 minutes and for at least 6 hours. Retreatment at 12-hour intervals (if needed) therefore appears to be indicated and provides 100 g of CaCl 2 and 37 g of calcium over 24 hours, but more aggressive treatment protocols are not recommended.",

This treatment method individually titrates the calcium dose required for each animal.

A typical treatment for an adult cow has been slow intravenous administration (over at least 5 min) of 100 mL of the 25% Epsom salts solution, which provides 2.5 g of magnesium (25 mg of magnesium per mL of solution).

The pH of the solution should be mildly acidic (pH 5.8) to maintain phosphate solubility in cold weather, but this is not needed when solutions are stored in warm ambient temperatures. A recommended treatment to an adult lactating dairy cow with severe hypophosphatemia is 300 mL of 10% NaH 2 PO 4 (monohydrate) solution by slow intravenous injection; this provides 7 g of phosphate (2.3 g of inorganic phosphate), and increases plasma phosphate concentrations for at least 6 hours. Human enema formulations that contain a mixture of monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate and dibasic sodium phosphate heptahydrate in a buffered solution have also been administered intravenously to cattle with hypophosphatemia but are not recommended. This human enema solution is extremely hypertonic and must be diluted before administration. A major drawback with intravenous administration of phosphate solutions is that they should not be administered within 2 hours of intravenous calcium administration because of concerns that calcium-phosphate precipitates may be formed in the plasma of cattle with treatmentinduced hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. This has traditionally been evaluated by calculating the calcium-phosphorus product, in which metastatic calcification may occur if the product of serum calcium concentration and serum phosphate concentration (both in mg/dL) exceeds 70.",

The principal disadvantage of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is that it is more descriptive than mechanistic, decreasing the value of the approach in explaining the cause of acid-base changes during disease. This is because the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation fails to distinguish among the effects of independent and dependent variables on plasma pH.

In contrast, the non-HCO 3 \u2212 buffer system is a closed system containing a fixed quantity of buffer. Another important physiologic distinction between these two buffer systems is that an open buffer system such as HCO 3 \u2212 can be effective beyond the limits of pH = p\u039aa \u00b1 1.5. Finally, it should be appreciated that HCO 3 \u2212 is a homogeneous buffer ion, whereas the nonvolatile buffer ion (A \u2212 ) represents a diverse and heterogeneous group of plasma buffers (albumin, globulin, and phosphate) that is being modeled as a single buffer. Another assumption in Stewart's strong ion model is that HA and A \u2212 do not take part in plasma reactions that result in the net destruction or creation of HA or A \u2212 . This is because when HA dissociates it ceases to be HA (therefore decreasing plasma [HA]) and becomes A \u2212 (therefore increasing plasma An equation relating plasma pH to three independent variables (Pco 2 , SID, and A TOT ) and three constants (K a , K 1 , and S) has been developed based on these assumptions. The most important factors that determine plasma pH are Pco 2 , SID, and the concentrations of individual nonvolatile plasma buffers (albumin, globulins, and phosphate). A change in any one of these variables will produce a direct and predictable change in plasma pH. Using the strong ion approach, six primary acid-base disturbances can be distinguished (Fig. 5-11 ) instead of the four primary acid-base disturbances (respiratory acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and metabolic alkalosis) differentiated when using the traditional Henderson-Hasselbalch approach. The strong ion approach indicates that acidemia results from an increase in Pco 2 and nonvolatile buffer concentration, or from a decrease in SID. Alkalemia results from a decrease in Pco 2 and nonvolatile buffer concentration, or from an increase in SID. The unmeasured strong anion concentration is quantified by calculating the strong ion gap (SIG). , on venous blood pH in 231 sick calves, most of which had diarrhea. The spider plot was obtained by systematically varying one input variable (SID, PCO 2 , or A tot ) while holding the remaining input variables at their reference values for calf venous plasma (42 mEq/L for SID), 53 mm Hg for PCO 2 , and 18.5 mmol/L for A tot . The solid vertical and horizontal lines indicate that venous blood pH = 7.38 when SID, PCO 2 , and A tot are at their reference values. Note that the individual data points are located more centrally around the predicted pH-SID relationship than for the pH-cHCO 3 \u2212 relationship identified in Figure 5 .9. This is because changes in plasma protein concentration (and therefore A tot ) caused by changes in hydration status account for some of the change in blood pH. The plot also indicates the six primary acid-base disturbances (respiratory, strong ion, or nonvolatile buffer ion acidosis and alkalosis) and the relative effect of each disturbance on blood pH in the neonatal calf. Note that changes in SID have the greatest relative effect on blood pH. ( acid in renal insufficiency or renal failure also contributes to a metabolic acidosis. The administration of excessive quantities of acidifying solutions for the treatment of metabolic alkalosis also may cause acidosis. Acute intestinal obstruction in the horse is commonly accompanied by metabolic acidosis, whereas in adult ruminants it is accompanied by alkalosis, at least initially.",

There is continuous secretion of hydrochloric acid and potassium into the abomasum, with failure of evacuation of the abomasal contents into the duodenum for absorption. Sequestration of hydrochloric acid and potassium occurs in the abomasum, along with reflux into the rumen, all of which results in a hypochloremic, hypokalemic alkalosis. In metabolic alkalosis, potassium will shift from the extracellular to the intracellular space, resulting in a hypokalemia when there may not be depletion of total body potassium. In cattle with metabolic alkalosis there is a paradoxical aciduria, which is not well understood but may be caused by severe electrolyte depletion placing limits on the kidney to regulate acid-base balance. Paradoxical aciduria must be differentiated from postparturient aciduria, which has been reported to occur in dairy cows. respiratory center (Kussmaul breathing).

Chronic (congestive) heart failure may need to be treated with digoxin and thrombophlebitis of the jugular veins may need specific treatment (see Chapter 10) . Parasitic gastroenteritis requires administration of the appropriate anthelmintic, obstructive edema requires removal of the physical cause, and increased permeability edema requires resolution of the cause of endothelial damage. Ancillary nonspecific measures include restriction of the amount of salt in the diet and the use of diuretics. Diuretics may relieve the effects of pressure temporarily, but the primary cause needs to be addressed for a satisfactory outcome. Aspiration of edema fluid is rarely successful and is not routinely recommended but usually provides temporary relief because the fluid rapidly accumulates. More localized edemas cause more localized signs: pulmonary edema is accompanied by respiratory distress and in some cases by an outpouring of froth from the nose; cerebral edema is manifested by severe nervous signs of altered mentation. A not uncommon entity is a large edematous plaque around the umbilicus in yearling horses. The plaque develops rapidly, causes no apparent illness, and subsides spontaneously after about 7 days. Thrombophlebitis is a common cause of localized edema, particularly of the head in horses and cattle with thrombophlebitis of both jugular veins.

It is this volatility that makes clinicopathologic monitoring so important. Some generalizations on the dynamics of fluid and electrolyte status are as follows: \u2022 Total body water and electrolytes are maintained at a homeostatic level by the buffering system of the blood, the lungs, and the kidneys. \u2022 In disturbances of body water and electrolytes, the changes that occur are also dynamic, and there is constant reaction by the homeostatic mechanism to restore the water and electrolyte relationship to normal. \u2022 With some exceptions, it is unusual to find an uncompensated alkalemia or acidemia. A partial compensation in the opposite direction of the primary acid-base imbalance is usually in progress, and it is important to determine the nature of the primary disturbance for the selection of rational therapy. A useful rule of thumb is that the primary disturbance (acidosis and alkalosis) is indicated by whether the blood pH is increased (alkalosis) or decreased (acidosis) relative to the mean value for the species examined. \u2022 Often, the nature of the primary disturbance can be determined from a consideration of the history and the clinical findings. \u2022 Dehydration caused by deprivation of water and electrolytes (lack of water or inability to drink) is mild and animals may appear only mildly dehydrated even after several days of water deprivation.

Three milliliters of air should then be drawn into the syringe and forcibly expelled; this process is repeated three times. Evacuating the syringe in this manner ensures that minimal heparin is retained to dilute the blood sample, but a sufficient quantity is still present to prevent coagulation. Alternatively, commercially available polypropylene syringes that contain lyophilized lithium heparin can be used, but these syringes are considerably more expensive than standard polypropylene syringes. 13 Air bubbles should be immediately removed from the blood in the syringe after collection by holding the syringe vertically and tapping the syringe forcefully with a finger so that bubbles are dislodged and float upward. Once all visible bubbles are removed, a small amount of blood is expelled with the syringe still held vertically so that the syringe hub and needle lumen no longer contain air bubbles. A cork is then placed on the end of the needle to prevent loss of CO 2 and addition of O 2 to the blood sample. Jugular venous blood samples can predict arterial blood gas values of pH, Pco 2 , bicarbonate concentration, total CO 2 , and base excess in animals that do not have respiratory disease, but only accurately predict blood pH in animals with respiratory disease. 14, 15 Changes in jugular venous Po 2 over time are reflective of the direction and magnitude of the change in arterial Po 2 . 16 Generally, the blood sample should be analyzed as soon as possible and preferably within 30 minutes of collection. The method used for storage of an anaerobically collected blood sample for blood gas and pH analysis differs depending on whether the sample was collected from an artery or large vein. Venous blood samples should be stored in ice water (0\u00b0C) until analysis. 17 This will minimize any time-related changes in the measured values for pH and Pco 2 and therefore the calculated values for base excess and total CO 2 , which occur when blood is held at room temperature (20\u00b0C) or higher ambient temperatures, particularly in blood samples with high white blood cell concentrations. If the primary interest is evaluation of the respiratory system, an arterial blood sample should domestic animals without clinical evidence of respiratory disease. In the absence of respiratory disease, a decrease in total CO 2 indicates a metabolic acidosis, whereas an increase in total CO 2 indicates metabolic alkalosis. Total CO 2 has historically been measured using the Harleco apparatus, although this methodology is no longer used because of the wide availability of pointof-care analyzers for blood gas and pH assessment.",

It is also important that large partially evacuated tubes are used to collect the blood sample; this is because the air to blood sample ratio is higher in small tubes (3 mL or less in sample volume), leading to lower measured values for total CO 2 even with complete filling of the tube. As a consequence, total CO 2 is most accurately measured when partially evacuated tubes of 4-to 10-mL sample volume are used, 9 and samples are stored at 4\u00b0C. 10 Because changes in total CO 2 reflect changes in actual bicarbonate concentration, total CO 2 can never provide an independent measure of the nonrespiratory component of an acid-base disturbance.

Quantitative, rapid, low-cost pointof-care methods for determining blood glucose concentrations are now widely available, but many units are designed for analysis of human blood and are not suitable for use in large animals because they incorrectly assume intraerythrocyte glucose concentration is the same as plasma glucose concentration (which is the case in most primates). In all of the domestic animals examined, intraerythrocyte glucose concentration is lower than plasma glucose concentration, and, consequently, the measured blood glucose value depends on the hematocrit, which is usually assumed to be fixed and approximately 44%. Consequently, preferred point-of-care glucose meters should use a species-specific algorithm for correcting the with l-lactate concentrations greater than 10 mmol/L associated with a high mortality in humans, pigs, and horses. A number of inexpensive handheld point-of-care devices are now available to measure blood l-lactate concentration. Most devices measure l-lactate concentration in whole blood through a two-step process on a specialized reagent strip. The l-lactate concentration is measured by placing a drop of blood onto the reagent strip; the blood seeps through a protective mesh on which the erythrocytes are retained and only plasma reaches the detection area. A chemical reaction takes place, and a change in color or current is rapidly detected and converted to an l-lactate concentration using a proprietary algorithm. Values can be displayed as whole blood or plasma based on a mathematical function of the analyzer. A number of method comparison studies have shown these units to be clinically useful, particularly when blood l-lactate concentrations are <15 mmol/L. Studies in critically ill human patients have shown excellent correlations between blood l-lactate concentration in arterial blood, pulmonary arterial blood, central venous blood, and blood obtained from a peripheral vein, indicating that jugular venous blood l-lactate concentration provides an accurate reflection of pulmonary arterial or systemic arterial blood l-lactate concentrations, which are regarded as the gold standard sites for measuring blood l-lactate concentration. Consequently, jugular venous blood l-lactate concentrations are now routinely measured in critically ill large animals, with the clinical emphasis on evaluating the change in l-lactate concentration over time. [20] [21] [22] This is because the change in l-lactate concentration over time (particularly to an intervention) has greater prognostic ability than the actual l-lactate concentration at one point in time.",

For example, in most cases of acute diarrhea there is hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis, which are usually marked in the horse with acute diarrhea. The serum concentration of chloride may be normal or subnormal in acute diarrhea. The serum concentration of potassium will be below normal initially, but as acidemia develops and becomes severe hyperkalemia may occur. In cattle with abomasal hypomotility there will be obtained in the same manner as a venous sample; however, the sample should be kept at body temperature (preferable) or room temperature before blood gas and pH analysis is performed, which should be completed as soon as possible. This is because storing 3-mL polypropylene syringes in ice water (0\u00b0C) facilitates oxygen diffusion through the barrel of the syringe, causing a preanalytical increase in Po 2 . Partially evacuated blood collection tubes should never be used for blood gas and pH analysis because they are not completely evacuated; consequently, an anaerobic blood sample cannot be obtained for analysis. Use of partially evacuated tubes always results in higher values for blood Po 2 and lower values for blood Pco 2 because oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood equilibrate with the oxygen-rich and carbon dioxide-poor air within the tube. 18 Use of point-of-care clinical analyzing systems has greatly facilitated routine evaluation of acid-base status in domestic animals and, generally, point-of-care systems are sufficiently accurate for clinical use. 19 A thorough assessment of acid-base status requires blood gas analysis and serum biochemical analysis, with blood samples obtained from a major vein or any artery.

The method uses a head-tail configuration (although other configurations have been used) and requires shaving two areas of skin over the right cranial border of the first cervical vertebra and over the caudal aspect of the right tuber ischia and cleaning the skin with alcohol.

Adhesive electrodes are used for humans but do not work well in horses. A multifrequency bioimpedance analyzer measures the resistance and reactance between the electrodes at multiple frequencies at the two sites and uses proprietary algorithms to calculate extracellular fluid volume, intracellular fluid volume, and total body water.

Sodium and potassium and their associated anions, along with glucose and urea, constitute the majority of normal osmotically active solutes.

The correct term in plasma and extracellular fluid is osmolality, because this factor is measured in the laboratory; however, frequently the term osmolarity is used because 1 L of lactated Ringer's solution closely approximates 1 kg of lactated Ringer's solution and because osmolarity can be easily calculated from the concentration of electrolytes in the fluid solution.

The principal reason constituents of plasma are defined in terms of mEq instead of mmol is because electroneutrality must be preserved at all times; the difference between the charge assigned to all strong cations (Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , and Mg 2+ ) and strong anions (Cl \u2212 , lactate, sulfate, ketoacids, nonesterified fatty acids, etc.) in plasma is called the SID, and this factor independently and directly alters blood pH and therefore acid-base status. The normal SID of plasma is approximately 40 mEq/L, although there are species differences in the actual value. Electrolyte solutions with an effective SID greater than 40 mEq/L are therefore alkalinizing because they create a strong ion alkalosis.

Electrolyte solutions of intermediate SID may be alkalinizing or acidifying, depending and osmolarity (hypotonic, isotonic, or hypertonic).

Sodium-containing crystalloid solutions are always indicated in hypovolemia (circuit problem) but are contraindicated in congestive heart failure (pump problem) because they provide an additional sodium load, and animals with heart failure have already retained too much sodium. Sodium-containing crystalloid solutions are also contraindicated in the presence of severe hypoalbuminemia because sodiumcontaining crystalloids will further decrease plasma albumin concentration and oncotic pressure, resulting in the movement of fluid into the interstitial spaces and exacerbating tissue edema.",

For instance, 1 mmol of NaCl in solution provides 2 mEq: 1 mEq of Na + (1 \u00d7 decreases plasma pH by approximately 0.016. Ringer's solution is the standard intravenous fluid for adult ruminants because these ruminants tend to get alkalemic when inappetent. Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl solution) is an isotonic crystalloid solution that has little merit in the routine treatment of sick ruminants, principally because ruminants usually develop hypocalcemia and hypokalemia when inappetent. Accordingly, the use of 0.9% NaCl should be confined to horses, the irrigation of surgical sites and wounds, or as a vehicle for adding other electrolytes and dextrose. Like Ringer's solution, 0.9% NaCl is mildly acidifying because effective SID = 0 mEq/L. Isotonic sodium bicarbonate (1.3% NaHCO 3 solution) is an alkalinizing isotonic crystalloid solution that is used to treat severe acidemia (indicated whenever blood pH <7.20 as a result of metabolic acidosis). This solution is alkalinizing because it buffers hydrogen ion, HCO 3 \u2212 + H + \u2194 CO 2 + H 2 O, and increases SID (effective SID = 155 mEq/L). Sodium bicarbonate is superior to sodium l-lactate and sodium acetate for the treatment of metabolic acidosis because it provides an immediate source of bicarbonate. On theoretical grounds, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) should not be used to treat severe respiratory acidosis, because additional CO 2 generated may worsen the respiratory acidosis. However, studies in critically ill large animals have failed to identify a clinically important effect of sodium bicarbonate infusion on increasing arterial Pco 2 , inducing respiratory acidosis and further decreasing blood pH. Moreover, concern has been raised that rapid large-volume sodium bicarbonate administration can result in systemic alkalinization but not paradoxical CSF acidosis, which may produce adverse neurologic sequelae. An in-depth review of the studies on this topic indicates that paradoxical CSF acidosis has only been observed in anesthetized animals with controlled ventilation. In other words, when sodium bicarbonate is administered to animals that control their own ventilation, even under anesthesia, paradoxical CSF acidosis does not occur because the animal detects the increase in arterial Pco 2 and reflexively increases minute volume to combat the bicarbonate-induced respiratory acidosis. 6 Tromethamine (THAM, Tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane, 300 mmol/L) is an isotonic solution of an organic amine that is a safe and effective buffer.

Five percent dextrose is 250 mOsm/L as administered, but plasma osmolarity decreases below 250 mOsm/L as the glucose is metabolized, leaving free water.

If glucose is indicated, large quantities of parenteral glucose are necessary to meet the maintenance energy requirements, and every effort must be made to restore the animal's appetite and to provide the necessary requirements through dietary intake. The energy requirements for maintenance are calculated on the basis of metabolic body size, kg 0.73 , which is a measure of the fasting metabolism in an animal not eating and not doing any muscular work. If 1 g of dextrose given intravenously will provide 5 kcal (2.1 kJ) of energy, the approximate amounts of dextrose solution needed to meet the energy needs for maintenance in cattle are shown in Table 5-4.

Fifty percent dextrose solutions are dehydrated calves with naturally acquired diarrhea has been conducted comparing intravenous hypertonic sodium bicarbonate (8.4%, 10 mL/kg over 8 minutes) and hypertonic saline (5.9%, 5 mL/kg over 4 minutes); calves receiving either treatment also received 3 L of an oral electrolyte solution 5 minutes after injection. As expected, the hypertonic sodium bicarbonate solution was more effective in correcting profound acidemia and metabolic acidosis than hypertonic saline. 18 The results of a study that compared the intravenous administration of equivalent sodium loads of 8.4% to 1.3% NaHCO 3 to neonatal calves with naturally acquired diarrhea and severe dehydration indicated that isotonic sodium bicarbonate was more effective in rehydrating the calf, whereas the rapid administration of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate was more effective in rapidly correcting the acidemia and strong ion (metabolic) acidosis. 19 There are recent studies evaluating the effect of hypertonic solutions of sodium lactate (11.2% at 5 mL/kg/h administered over 270 minutes); lactate provides an energy substrate that can be used by most cells in the body, while being alkalinizing after metabolism to bicarbonate. In a pig endotoxemia model, infusion of hypertonic sodium lactate increased mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output and improved oxygenation, relative to hypertonic sodium bicarbonate or 0.9% NaCl solution. 20 Sodium bicarbonate 5% is 1190 mOsm/ L (approximately four times normal osmolarity). This solution is also used for rapid alkalinization in the presence of severe acidemia (pH <7.20). The speed of intravenous administration of 5.0% sodium bicarbonate should not exceed 2 (mL/kg)/min. Three to five liters of 5% sodium bicarbonate may be necessary as initial therapy to correct the severe hyponatremia and strong ion (metabolic) acidosis that occurs in the horse with acute diarrhea. Following this initial treatment, hypokalemia characterized by muscular weakness commonly occurs, which can be treated using a high-sodium, high-potassium, alkalinizing solution.",

            "text": "Hypertonic saline solutions have been extensively studied in horses and are widely used for the initial resuscitation of critically ill horses that are undergoing abdominal surgery for colic. Hypertonic saline has been associated with greater and more prolonged improvement in cardiopulmonary function and survival in horses with experimentally induced hemorrhagic and endotoxemic shock and in halothane-induced hypotension in horses. When given intravenously to normal conscious horses at 5 mL/kg BW, there are increases in plasma osmolality and serum sodium and chloride, but clinically normal horses rapidly regulate variable sodium loads. In horses with experimentally induced acute endotoxemia, horses resuscitated with intravenous hypertonic saline (5 mL/kg) and hydroxyethyl starch (10 mL/ kg) had a higher cardiac output, lower mean pulmonary artery pressure and mean central venous pressure, higher ionized plasma calcium concentration, and improved respiratory gas exchange and arterial oxygenation than horses resuscitated with high-volume isotonic acetated Ringer's solution. 14, 15 These results were consistent with increased interstitial water in the lung and volume overload as a result of conventional rapid high-volume isotonic solution administration. 14 Similar findings were reported earlier in the resuscitation of endotoxemic calves. 11 Hypertonic saline (7.2%) at 4 mL/kg provided a superior resuscitative solution than equivolume isotonic saline (0.9%) in horses eliminated from an endurance event because of dehydration. Dehydrated horses administered hypertonic saline had a greater plasma volume expansion and shorter time to first urination than horses receiving isotonic saline. 16 Hypertonic solutions of sodium bicarbonate are highly effective for the initial treatment of acidosis associated with d-lactic acidosis in calves, acute diarrhea in calves, and strong ion (metabolic) acidosis in newborn calves. Sodium bicarbonate 8.4% is 2000 mOsm/L (approximately seven times normal osmolarity). This solution is used for rapid alkalinization, particularly in the presence of severe acidemia (pH <7.20). The solution osmolarity was selected because it provides 1 mEq of HCO 3 \u2212 /mL of solution, which facilitates calculation of the volume to be administered. The speed of intravenous administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate should not exceed 1 (mL/kg BW)/min. There is one report of the intravenous administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to normovolemic calves with experimentally induced mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis; the study found that rapid administration of sodium bicarbonate (5 mL/kg intravenously over 5 min) rapidly corrected the metabolic acidosis, increased blood pH, and improved cardiovascular status without inducing paradoxical CSF acidosis, suggesting that this treatment may be of value in treating dehydrated diarrheic calves. 17 A study in demonstrate efficacy of hypertonic saline in resuscitating dehydrated calves also administered dextran to assist in sustained plasma volume expansion, 7, 8 subsequent studies have demonstrated that the addition of dextran is not required for a beneficial response. 9, 10 Hypertonic saline solution is widely used for the treatment of dairy cattle with endotoxic shock and endotoxemia associated with coliform mastitis. Affected cows are given 2 L of hypertonic saline (4-5 mL/kg BW) intravenously, followed by immediate access to drinking water and other supportive therapy. The small volume of hypertonic saline followed by the oral water load increases circulatory volume rapidly, induces slight metabolic acidosis, increases renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate, and induces homeostatic changes in serum calcium and phosphorus. In experimental endotoxin-induced mastitis of cattle, small volumes of hypertonic saline given intravenously (7.5%, 5 mL/kg BW) resulted in expanded plasma volume and increased the cows' voluntary water intake by about 12 times compared with cows treated with isotonic saline. The rapid intravenous administration of hypertonic saline successfully, but transiently, resuscitates calves in experimental endotoxic shock. 11 Hypertonic saline (7.2% NaCl, 2400 mOsm/L), 4 mL/kg BW intravenously over 4 minutes can be safely administered to endotoxic calves. On a comparative basis, the rapid infusion of largevolume isotonic saline is superior to small-volume hypertonic saline for initial resuscitation of experimentally induced acutely endotoxemic calves.",

Like Dextran 70, hydroxyethyl starch administration runs the risk of exacerbating preexisting coagulopathies. The risk of coagulopathy is dependent on the administration rate, total dose administered (20 mL/kg BW is the maximum 24-hour dose in humans), and size of the hydroxyethyl starch particles. Administration of 6% hydroxyethyl starch to anesthetized horses at 5 to 15 mL/kg over 90 minutes increased mean central venous pressure and cardiac output but did not correct inhalation anesthetic-induced systemic hypotension. 24 The rapid administration of 6% hydroxyethyl starch to horses with naturally occurring gastrointestinal disease at 10 mL/kg increased colloid osmotic pressure by approximately 20%, but did not return values to within the reference range. 25 High molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch formulations have been recently linked to nephrotoxicity, acute renal failure, and mortality in humans, particularly in septic patients or patients with preexisting renal disease, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended in 2013 that they not be used in critically ill adults and patients with preexisting renal dysfunction or severe liver disease. Low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch formulations do not seem to demonstrate similar adverse effects, but are cleared at a faster rate because of their small size, resulting in a shorter duration of action. The relevance of these findings to the use of hydroxyethyl starch formulations in large animals is uncertain, because clinically relevant coagulation abnormalities caused by hydroxyethyl starch were not identified when administered to horses with experimentally induced acute endotoxemia at 10 mL/kg. 15 Hydroxyethyl starch solutions do exert dose-dependent in vitro effects on coagulation in horse blood, as assessed by platelet aggregation and function. 23 The clinical relevance of these in vitro findings has not been determined.",

Some formulations contain other agents such as lecithin-coated pectin fiber that is reported to decrease the proliferation of E. coli and Salmonella spp., or other agents that facilitate normalization of the enteric bacterial population. Knowledge of the requirements for the ideal oral electrolyte solution for diarrheic calves continues to evolve. However, much progress has been made over the last 30 years, and the critical issues in formulating the ideal oral electrolyte solution are osmolality, sodium concentration, source of the alkalinizing agent, and the energy content (which is intimately tied to osmolality). It remains to be determined whether oral electrolyte solutions should contain agents such as glutamine that may facilitate repair of damaged intestinal epithelium. This issue is being actively researched at the moment and a clear consensus has not yet been reached.",

            "text": "Oral electrolyte solutions should be routinely administered to all neonatal calves <21 days of age at the first signs of diarrhea because it cannot be accurately predicted how quickly the calf will become dehydrated. Calves with a 4-mm or greater recession of the eye or calves that are unable to stand should receive intravenous fluids (smallvolume hypertonic saline, small-volume sodium bicarbonate, or conventional largevolume isotonic crystalloid solution) in addition to an oral electrolyte solution. The initial treatment of a dehydrated calf should use an oral electrolyte solution that is not added to milk replacer because this provides superior plasma volume expansion. 32 The osmolality of the oral electrolyte solution should range from isotonic (300 mosm/kg) to hypertonic (700 mOsm/kg). The effective osmolality at the tip of the intestinal villus is approximately 600 mOsm/kg because of the presence of a countercurrent exchange mechanism. Although markedly hypertonic fluids should be avoided in animals with severe villous damage, it is currently not possible to predict which calves have severe villous damage on the basis of the physical examination findings and measurement of fecal pH or other body parameter. Low osmolality fluids (300 mosm/ kg) have inadequate energy content because they have insufficient glucose. For this reason, if milk is withheld, then hypertonic oral electrolyte solutions (~600 mosm/kg) should be administered. 33, 34 If milk is fed, then isotonic oral electrolyte solutions (300 mosm/kg) should be administered because inadequate energy content is no longer an issue. 34, 35 Ideally fresh milk should be fed to diarrheic calves after 24 hours of treatment; fresh cow's milk is preferred to milk replacer or pasteurized waste milk because fresh milk contains trophic factors that facilitate repair of damaged intestinal epithelium, and the energy content of milk is required to maintain BW. Generally, milk should not be withheld from diarrheic calves for more than 24 hours. 37 The sodium concentration or the oral electrolyte solution should be between 90 and 130 mmol/L. Adequate sodium absorption is the fundamental determinant of successful expansion of the extracellular space, and is the main reason that oral electrolyte solutions are administered (the sodium concentration of milk is very low with an average value of 28 mmol/L). Sodium concentrations <90 mmol/L provide an inadequate sodium load, whereas sodium concentrations >130 mmol/L can lead to hypernatremia and additional free water loss.",

[39] [40] [41] Acetate-containing fluids are as effective as bicarbonate-containing solutions at correcting mild to moderate acidosis: [acetate-= CH 3 COO \u2212 ] + H + + 2O 2 \u2194 2CO 2 + 2H 2 O. Acetate must be metabolized to be effective, and metabolism may be impaired in severely dehydrated or acidemic animals, although this has not been proven in severely dehydrated calves. Acetate-or propionatecontaining fluids can be fed with milk as acetate and propionate do not raise abomasal pH or inhibit milk clotting. In comparison, bicarbonate containing oral electrolyte solutions, when fed without milk, excessively alkalinize the abomasum and proximal small intestine, decreasing the effectiveness of the \"abomasal sterilizer\" in killing ingested enteric pathogens, and potentially promoting enterotoxigenic E. coli attachment to epithelial cells and STa enterotoxin production. Moreover, bicarbonate does not inhibit growth of Salmonella in the intestinal lumen, whereas acetate and propionate both inhibit Salmonella growth. However, it is important to note that bicarbonate-containing oral electrolyte fluids are theoretically more effective at rapidly correcting severe acidemia than acetate and propionate, because bicarbonate reacts directly with H + ions (HCO 3 \u2212 + H + \u2194 H 2 CO 3 \u2194 H 2 O + CO 2 ). The main disadvantage of bicarbonate-containing oral fluids is that the pH of the abomasum (a natural defense mechanism) is increased, raising concerns that bicarbonate may decrease the ability to form a clot in the abomasum. This theoretical disadvantage regarding bicarbonate does not appear to be true, at least when low concentration bicarbonate solutions (25 mmol/L) are fed. 37 The alkalinizing potential of an oral electrolyte solution can be estimated by calculating the effective SID of the formulation as fed. Because electroneutrality must be preserved at all times, the difference between the charge assigned to all strong cations in an oral electrolyte solution (usually only sodium and potassium) and strong anions in an oral electrolyte solution (usually only chloride) is called the effective SID and reflects the concentration of metabolizable strong anions, such as acetate, propionate, and citrate, as well as the concentration of bicarbonate. 39 Oral electrolyte solutions should have an effective SID of approximately 40 to 80 mmol/L. Electrolyte solutions with an effective SID = 0 are acidifying because they create a systemic strong ion acidosis; such solutions are not recommended for the treatment of dehydrated calves with diarrhea.",

In the past, it was conventional to withhold milk from diarrheic calves for 1 to 2 days and then gradually reintroduce milk over the next few days when there is evidence of recovery. An extreme practice was to totally deprive the calf of milk until the diarrhea ceased. The rationale for this practice was that the ability of the calf 's intestine to digest milk was impaired, particularly lactose digestion in the rotavirus and coronavirus diarrheas of young calves. It was also thought that the presence of milk in the intestine would provide a substrate for continued growth of enteric pathogens. Recent studies in calves with naturally acquired and experimentally induced diarrhea have demonstrated the benefit of feeding milk to diarrheic calves receiving oral electrolyte solutions 35 ; such practice results in more rapid recovery from diarrhea (fewer days of diarrhea), less debilitation, continued weight gain, greater fat stores, faster rate of regeneration of the intestinal mucosa, and less thymic atrophy than calves deprived of milk. Adding the oral electrolyte solution to the milk of calves with diarrhea is effective and practical; this treatment approach requires that water be readily available to treated calves at all times. 36 In adult ruminants, both water and sodium must be absorbed to produce sustained expansion of the extracellular fluid space. Acetic, propionic, and butyric acids are absorbed rapidly from the forestomach in their nonionized form but are absorbed more slowly in conjunction with a sodium ion in their ionized form. Cattle produce up to 180 L of saliva per day with a sodium concentration of 126 mEq/L, and approximately half of the sodium secreted with saliva is reabsorbed by the forestomach primarily through active transport mechanisms. Based on this physiology, orally administered sodium is well absorbed in adult ruminants, and sodium absorption is accompanied by the passive movement of water from the rumen into the extracellular space.",

The tonicity of the oral rehydration solution is of minor clinical importance; however, oral administration of hypertonic solutions (628 mOsm/kg BW) to dehydrated horses caused a transient increase in plasma protein concentration that was attributed to movement of water into the bowel lumen. Continuous flow administration of a hypotonic solution at 15 (mL/kg)/h through a small-diameter nasoesophageal tube is effective in increasing plasma glucose concentration in healthy adult horses, with maltodextrin (15 g/L) providing a greater glycemic response to that provided by glucose (15 g/L). This treatment protocol appears to provide a useful low-cost method for treating horses that are slightly dehydrated and hypoglycemic, but safety studies using a larger number of horses are required. 43 A practical limitation of oral rehydration solutions in horses is that they should be ingested voluntarily rather than by nasogastric intubation. This limitation has led to recent interest in the oral administration of pastes.",

The latter formulation has been used for parenteral nutrition in alpacas. 48 B-complex vitamins are usually added to the final parenteral nutrition solution, and there is no clear consensus on the need for concurrent insulin administration. Typical commercially available products administered in North America are designed for use in humans in a critical care setting and include 50% dextrose solution, an 8.5% amino acid solution without electrolytes, and a 20% lipid emulsion solution, with the lipid solution as the most expensive component. In a retrospective study of 53 foals that received parenteral nutrition including lipids, 32% developed hypertriglyceridemia (>200 mg/dL), and this development was significantly associated with nonsurvival. 47 This finding suggests that parenteral nutrition in foals should use limited amounts of lipid for energy, and current recommendations in septic human patients are to provide no more than 5% of the caloric intake from lipid emulsions. Fifteen percent of the 53 foals developed catheter-related complications such as thrombophlebitis or sepsis. 47 This emphasizes the need for strict aseptic technique whenever attaching or flushing fluid administration lines and catheters in animals receiving parenteral nutrition.",

Cows with hepatic lipidosis or prolonged anorexia sometimes require continuous intravenous infusion of dextrose for several days until they can maintain energy balance. The continuous intravenous infusion of 50% dextrose (0.3 g/kg/h) to healthy lactating dairy cows resulted in hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and a marked reduction in plasma phosphorus concentration. Other effects of intravenous dextrose infusion included decreased plasma potassium concentration, decreased dry matter intake and fecal production, and a transient increase in milk production followed by a sustained decrease.

The spider plot was obtained by systematically varying one input variable (cHCO 3 \u2212 or PCO 2 ) while holding the remaining input variables at their reference values for calf venous plasma. Reference values for the two input variables for calf plasma were 29.5 mmol/L for cHCO 3 \u2212 (large open circles) and 53 mm Hg for PCO 2 (open squares).

A 1-mL bleb of 2% lidocaine is placed intradermally at the proposed site of catheter insertion and a 5-mm long stab incision made through the skin, including the dermis. A, The catheter is then placed into the lumen of the vein and carefully advanced until the hub of the catheter is level with the skin. The catheter is secured by placing sutures through the skin using an 18-gauge needle and a synthetic multifilament suture material. The suture does a loop around the extension tubing near where it attaches to the hub of the catheter so that the catheter cannot back out.

            "text": "Auricular Vein of Cattle and CalvesIntravenous fluids are commonly administered to adult cattle and calves in northern Europe using the auricular vein. The short neck, thick skin, and, in some breeds, pendulous dewlap of cattle make it difficult to introduce and secure indwelling jugular catheters for long-term use. The auricular vein of adult cattle can be successfully catheterized with an over-the-needle, 5-cm long, 14-gauge catheter, permitting 20 L of rehydration solution to be delivered over 4 hours. The auricular vein of neonatal calves can be successfully catheterized with an over-theneedle, 2.5-cm long, 22-gauge butterfly catheter, after clipping the external pinna and applying a tourniquet at the base of the ear to facilitate visualization of blood vessels and catheter advancement(Fig. 5-20). Catheters in Horses Percutaneous cecal catheters have been used to deliver fluid solutions in ponies. The advantages include less cost, but complications include peritonitis, diarrhea, laminitis, and hypocalcemia. Long-term jugular vein catheterization (over a period of a few days) in adult cattle and particularly horses can result in thrombophlebitis, suppurative phlebitis, and catheter sepsis. Inspection of the affected jugular vein reveals swelling, firmness, and moderate pain. Careful digital and visual inspection is necessary to determine the patency of the vein; in about 50% of cases the vein is completely thrombosed and occluded and cannot be used for intravenous administration for 2 to 3 weeks. The extent and severity of the thrombophlebitis can be determined by ultrasonography of the neck, and patency of the vein can be assessed by compressing the vein with the transducer head.The development of thrombophlebitis is dependent on the method used for skin preparation and the catheterization",
