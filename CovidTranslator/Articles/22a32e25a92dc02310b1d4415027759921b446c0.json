            "text": "Viral infections are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly people and young children throughout the world. The most common pathogens include coxsackie virus (CV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, no antiviral agents with low toxicity and drug resistance are currently available in clinic therapy. The present study aimed to examine the antiviral activities of emodin (an ingredient of Rheum palmatum) against CVB 5 and RSV infections, in an attempt to discover new antiviral agents for virus infection. The monomer emodin was extracted and isolated from Rheum palmatum. The antiviral activities of emodin on HEp-2 cells were evaluated, including virus replication inhibition, virucidal and anti-absorption effects, by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and plaque reduction assay (PRA). The kinetics of virus inhibition by emodin in a period of 14 h was further determined by plaque assay and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Cytokine (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) mRNA expressions after emodin treatment (7.5, 15, 30 \u03bcmol/L) were also assessed by qPCR post-infection. The results showed that emodin had potent inhibitory activities against CVB 5 and RSV, with the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) ranging from 13.06 to 14.27 \u03bcmol/L and selectivity index (SI) being 5.38-6.41 \u03bcmol/L. However, emodin couldn't directly inactivate the viruses or block their absorption to cells. It acted as a biological synthesis inhibitor against CVB 4 and RSV in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, especially during the first 0-4 h post-infection. Moreover, emodin could decrease the mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b1 but enhance TNF-\u03b3 expression significantly compared to the viral controls in vitro. Our results provide a molecular basis for development of emodin as a novel and safe antiviral agent for human enterovirus and respiratory virus infection in the clinical therapy.",

However, emodin could not prevent HEp-2 cells from virus infection in anti-absorption assay, nor could it show virucidal effects against CVB 5 and RSV. The results implied that emodin may inhibit virus biological synthesis rather than directly inactivating the viruses or blocking their absorption to the susceptible cells in vitro. To gain more insight into the mechanism by which emodin interrupts virus replication, time of addition assays were performed to determine the time point of maximum inhibition by emodin. Only 15.5%-41.6% plaques were formed when emodin was added immediately or at 2, 4 h after virus adsorption but rapidly increased to 90% when added 10 h post-infection. In qPCR study, a dramatic reduction in infectious virus copies was observed at 0-4 h post-infection, which coincided with the results of plaque formed. Our data demonstrated that emodin may interrupt the early stages of the viral replication cycle.",

For example, specific expression of IFN-\u03b3 could control hepatitis B virus replication in vitro [33] and was both necessary and sufficient to clear measles virus in infected brain tissue [34] . Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3 could restrict cell-to-cell spread of CVB 3 in the heart to limit myocardial organ injury [35, 36] and was observed to protect pancreatic cells from invading CVB 4 by activation of resident macrophages [37] . TNF, a polypeptide cytokine produced by activated macrophages, monocytes and T cells, has been proved pivotal in triggering the inflammatory infection. For instance, TNF-\u03b1 was over-expressed through activation of cardiomyocyte-specific promoter regions [38] , and also enhanced the expression of a variety of adhesion molecules required for inflammatory cell infiltration of infection sites in CVB 3 -induced myocarditis [39] .",

Emodin could inhibit the replication of CVB 5 and RSV post-infection in a concentration-and time-dependent manner and possess antiviral activities against virus by regulating cytokine (IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1) expression. As the activation of inflammatory cytokines and virus replication share the same intercellular pathway, our finding might provide some clues for understanding the mechanism by which emodin acts on these cascades. Emodin may be an antiviral candidate with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities by targeting or interrupting viruses or virus synthesis-related proteins in the early stages of the viral replication cycle. Its modulatory function on virus-induced inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 might contribute to the immunoregulation effect of the drug. Further studies of these pathways using microarray analysis or Western blotting analysis will be needed. Being the main component extracted from Rheum palmatum, emodin holds the promises to become a potential therapeutic agent for virus infection.",
