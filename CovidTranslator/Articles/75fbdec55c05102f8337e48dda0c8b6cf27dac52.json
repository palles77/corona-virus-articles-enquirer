Since there is little information about SSTR2 in canine mammary gland tumor (MGT), we clarified its distribution and expression level in normal mammary gland, benign MGT and malignant MGT. SSTR2 expression determined by immunohistochemical staining was observed in the cytoplasm of luminal epithelial cells. The intensity was negatively correlated with malignancy: normal tissues and some of the benign tumors had the highest levels, while the malignant tumors had little or no SSTR2 expression. As for the Western blotting, SSTR2 protein level in benign tumors was significantly lower than the normal mammary gland. On the other hand, SSTR2 protein levels in two of three malignant tumors were higher than the other groups. These results suggest that SSTR2 expression alters according to the malignancy of canine MGT.",

Among the SST receptor (SSTR) superfamily, SSTR2 is the most dominant receptor, with the highest affinity to the ligand and the strongest antiproliferative effect [3] . In human breast cancer, tumor tissues that express SSTRs are less aggressive and more differentiated than tumors with little SSTRs expression, which are massive and highly malignant [5] . These findings lead to the speculation that SSTR signal transduction is closely related to the malignancy of human breast cancer.",

These findings suggest that SSTR2 deficiency in canines may contribute to the development of benign tumors. Alteration of SSTR2 expression in the MGT is not fully understood. Some studies in human breast cancer report that the SSTR2 immunohistochemical reaction was less in malignant tumors than in normal tissue, but others report the opposite relationship for SSTR2 mRNA. For instance, Reubi et al. detected SSTR2-positive immunoreactivity in only 3/39 (8%) of human malignant breast tumors [15] , while Orlando et al. performed q-PCR of 169 human breast cancers and concluded that the SSTR2 mRNA level was tremendously higher in human breast cancers than in unaffected tissues [13] . Evans et al. found SSTR2 mRNA expression in almost all breast carcinoma, but in only approximately half of benign tumors or normal breast tissues [7] . In the present study, all of SSTR2 immunohistochemical intensity in malignant tumors was lower or negative compared to normal tissues, whereas SSTR2 protein levels in two of three malignant tumors were higher than the other groups in the Western blotting analysis.

In this study, the same primary antibody to SSTR2 was used for both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. However, very little reactivity was observed in immunohistochemistry, while Western blotting detected a large amount of protein. Indeed, it is not so rare that there is some discrepancy between the results of immunohistochemistry and Western blotting [6, 9] . Although further studies are needed to understand the reasons for these results, there are several hypotheses that could account for them. 1) In immunohistochemistry, the tissue is fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and the epitope may be obscured or cross-linked due to experimental conditions. 2) Because Western blotting was performed after the reduction treatment, a conformational change in the protein may alter the intensity of immunoreactivity.",

There was less expression of SSTR2 in benign MGTs than in normal tissues. In malignant MGT, immunohistochemical intensity of SSTR2 was low, although SSTR2 protein levels were high. It is suggested that SSTR2 expression changes with malignancy of canine MGT. ",
