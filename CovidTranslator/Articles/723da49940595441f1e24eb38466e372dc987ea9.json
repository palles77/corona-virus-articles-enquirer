Models must balance biological realism against limitations of knowledge, and uncertainties need to be accurately communicated to policy-makers. Smallpox poses the particular challenge that key biological, social and spatial factors affecting disease spread in contemporary populations must be elucidated largely from historical studies undertaken before disease eradication in 1979. We review the use of models in smallpox planning within the broader epidemiological context set by recent outbreaks of both novel and re-emerging pathogens. E vents of recent years have heightened awareness of the potential threat of bioterrorism 1 , with smallpox considered to pose the greatest risk owing to the lethality (around 30%, depending on age and other factors 2,3 ) and transmissibility of the virus. Although once endemic in many human populations, smallpox was eradicated in 1979 largely as a result of mass vaccination reinforced by other highly focused control measures 3 . Today, although viral samples are officially retained in only two locations, the existence of other sources cannot be ruled out 4 . In the face of such a difficult to quantify, unlikely, but potentially serious threat, contingency planning demands a rational assessment of the scale of casualties that a smallpox attack might cause, and identification of what controls might be optimal in minimizing its effects 5-8 . The latter task is complicated by the severe adverse effects of vaccination experienced by a significant minority of individuals 9,10 , such that a national mass vaccination campaign could cause more deaths than an isolated smallpox epidemic. A second key problem is the passage of time since the last smallpox outbreak: human populations, mobility and patterns of social interactions have changed in the last 30 years, complicating extrapolation from historical epidemics to the prediction of future outbreaks.",

R 0 essentially determines how intensive a policy will need to be to control the epidemic, whereas both T G and R 0 determine the time available to implement suitably intensive controls.",

In contrast, smallpox is both less infectious (R 0 \u00bc 4-10; refs 20, 21) and has a much longer incubation period (T G < 21 days); thus, if an outbreak is detected in its earliest stages, there is sufficient time for localized control measures to be adopted. The feasibility of localized outbreak control during the final phase of the global smallpox vaccination programme, once a degree of 'herd immunity' had been created, is a key reason why smallpox was the first major viral pathogen to be eradicated worldwide 3,6 .",

It is unclear how much residual immunity remains today as a result of past vaccination programmes; those vaccinated 25-30 years ago are unlikely to possess complete immunity and a significant proportion may develop less severe forms of the disease 2,3 , potentially changing the dynamics of transmission. Allowing for past immunity levels is therefore critical when estimating R 0 from historical data 20 . Historically, most infections occurred in care-givers to symptomatic individuals, whether in households or hospitals 3 . It is unclear how 30 years of changes in household sizes, working patterns and mobility would affect transmission patterns today (see Box 2) . Incorporating detailed data on demographics and human mobility into spatially explicit models offers one method by which such extrapolation can be made more reliable, but the scale of changes mean that much uncertainty will inevitably remain.",

By attempting to identify a single 'optimal' strategy, recently published studies are arguably attempting the impossible; this is reflected in their differing conclusions, which can largely be attributed to underlying differences in model structures and parameter assignments. A more useful goal for modelling is to identify a small set of control options that might be used in a range of scenarios, together with a set of trigger thresholds, which might determine when responses need to be escalated.

For smallpox, such a role might be even more critical-to identify which of the many parameter and release scenarios explored in preparatory planning is actually being realized (for example, in relation to changes in population behaviour caused by the outbreak), and thus which set of controls is likely to be optimal in containing the outbreak while minimizing casualties. The footand-mouth story highlighted the potential advantages to be gained from having model and data structures in place as much as possible before any epidemic.

Investigation of this issue now, using simulation and analytical studies, is critical. Realtime data capture and dissemination is essential, and infrastructure needs to be developed in advance to facilitate this critical mechanism for implementing and monitoring interventions. Currently, it is unclear what level of detail would be necessary for models used in such a context-although some incorporation of the random effects that dominate epidemics in their early stages would clearly be desirable. If it were determined that the first few generations of cases in an outbreak would give insufficient information for realtime policy optimization, then a precautionary 'hit hard, hit early' policy might be warranted (coupled with a set of criteria for deescalating the policy), despite the higher associated costs and adverse consequences of vaccinating more people than might strictly be necessary.
