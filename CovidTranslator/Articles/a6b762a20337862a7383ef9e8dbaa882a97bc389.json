On January 30, 2020, the epidemic was recognized as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization, and was officially declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The increasing number of cases and deaths poses a major global public health challenge 1 and has already brought a heavy burden to the economy of the world. 2 By February 28, 2020, a total of 78,959 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection had been reported in China with an overall mortality rate of 3.53% (2,791 cases). 3 Of these, 13,052 cases were reported outside Hubei province, with an overall mortality rate of 0.85% (111 cases). The reasons for the reduced mortality outside Hubei province are unknown, however it is possible the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), loses pathogenicity due to passage, it is possible primary care is now more appropriate than during the early stages of the outbreak and it is also possible that screening for diagnosis and management is more appropriate. 4 During the outbreak in Sichuan province, we developed and implemented a hospital-specific systematic process for screening, isolating and managing suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this paper is to report the effectiveness of this process. All rights reserved.

Of the three confirmed cases, one was a female visitor in her late 40`s who had no clear history of epidemiology but was identified as having cough. She was immediately sent to the fever clinic and was identified as having a fever. Through our emergency response system, she was quickly sampled for screening and confirmed COVID-19 after two consecutive positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. As a result of contact tracing, the female inpatient she visited and one male relative were subsequently confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two positive RT PCR tests. These three COVID-19 confirmed patients were sent to the public health clinical service center for non-critical care. The male patient has been discharged after repeated negative SARS-CoV-2 testing, whilst the two female patients have not yet met discharge criteria and remained hospitalized at the end of the study follow-up period (28 February 2020).",

We strongly recommend that screening resources should focus on self-presenting patients, hospital visitors and inpatients. Furthermore, the rapid establishment of the ability to test nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 using RT PCR in our hospital greatly shortened turn-around time and was beneficial in that it allowed early isolation and control of high-risk patients and discharge of low-risk (negative) patients.",
