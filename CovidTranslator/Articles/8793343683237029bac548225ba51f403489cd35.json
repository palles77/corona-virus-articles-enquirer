The original description of ARDS was incapable of identifying a uniform group of patients. 5 A precise definition is crucial since the effects on outcome of MV and adjunctive techniques depend on the degree of lung injury. 6 In 1994, an American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) 7 formalised the diagnostic criteria for ARDS and acute lung injury (ALI) but these definitions have been challenged over the years. 8 9 In 2012, a proposal for updating the ARDS definition (the Berlin criteria) was published. 10 Three ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) cut-off values recorded at ARDS onset: severe (\u2264100 mm Hg), moderate (>100\u2212\u2264200) and mild (>200\u2212\u2264300), were proposed. By only considering patients who were on PEEP\u22655 cm H 2 O at the time of study enrolment, the panel found that hospital mortality increased with every stage of PaO 2 /FiO 2 severity. Since the Berlin criteria, similar to the AECC criteria, did not mandate the assessment of hypoxaemia under standardised ventilator conditions, we hypothesised that PaO 2 /FiO 2 values recorded at ARDS onset or at 24 h without standardisation of ventilatory management would not provide accurate assessment of ARDS severity. To test our hypothesis, we sought to characterise 478 consecutive patients with ARDS, most of them enrolled in two published multicentre observational studies, 9 11 using the Berlin criteria at ARDS onset and reassessed after 24 h of routine clinical care and at 24 h under standardised levels of PEEP and FiO 2 .",

Total number of extrapulmonary organ failures included in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scale 13 was documented daily. Patients were followed-up until hospital death or discharge.

            "text": "Our present investigation in a large population of consecutive patients with moderate and severe ARDS who were managed with a low-VT strategy in the context of two observational studies revealed that: (1) the value of PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at the time of ARDS diagnosis failed to identify subgroups of patients with a distinct degree of lung injury, and (2) a standardised ventilatory method based on preset PEEP and FiO 2 levels is more precise than the use of PaO 2 /FiO 2 at ARDS onset or after 24 h of usual care in assessing risk stratification of patients with ARDS. Our study suggests that patients within an identical PaO 2 /FiO 2 range at baseline or after 24 h may not have similar degrees of lung injury or prognosis. We found that there was a marked PaO 2 /FiO 2 variability within the first 24 h of ARDS diagnosis since patients could have the same range of PaO 2 /FiO 2 but calculated under different levels of ventilatory support. If assessment of ARDS severity is of crucial importance, it should be appropriate to set standardised rules for quantifying the severity of lung injury. The Berlin proposal of using the value of PaO 2 /FiO 2 at the time of ARDS onset does not mandate standardisation of PEEP and FiO 2 levels. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 is generally calculated under a wide range of applied PEEP and FiO 2 , and can be easily manipulated by changing the PEEP and FiO 2 . Thus, if the measurement of PaO 2 is not standardised, the calculated PaO 2 /FiO 2 may mask the severity of the underlying lung pathology in a substantial proportion of patients. Although baseline PEEP could not predict outcome, 11 14 baseline FiO 2 does predict mortality. 11 15 The key issue unmasked by our analyses is that many patients with severe lung disease evolved with usual care to less severe forms of lung injury within 24 h while others evolved to more severe forms of ARDS, as clearly demonstrated by the lack of concordance between the Berlin criteria and data at 24 h under SVS. The use of 24 h non-standardised PaO 2 /FiO 2 was also inferior to PaO 2 /FiO 2 assessment for risk stratification under SVS at 24 h. Since clinical practice introduces bias in the assessment of lung injury severity, our study clearly supports that it is the standardisation of ventilatory settings at 24 h that is crucial for appropriate stratification. Our model of risk stratification supports the fact that all cases of severe hypoxaemia are not ARDS. Patients whose oxygenation status changes dramatically in 24 h under a standardised assessment method would not be expected to have severe generalised lung inflammation as in ARDS, and should not be classified as ARDS. Our findings have implications for clinical trials design and patient enrolment. ALI has a range of severity from mild pulmonary insult to full blown ARDS. The assessment of PaO 2 /FiO 2 at 24 h after ARDS diagnosis on SVS can be used to insure a better categorisation of patients by disease severity. As our data suggest, the use of the Berlin criteria or the PaO 2 /FiO 2 at 24 h under non-standardised conditions is inadequate for enrolling patients with similar degrees of lung injury into clinical trials. The use of baseline or non-standardised PaO 2 / FiO 2 values for fast enrolment into therapeutic clinical trials may be responsible for patient selection bias, as a treatment that might benefit a subgroup of patients with ARDS is also tested in patients who are unresponsive to the experimental treatment. Some clinicians are concerned about a mandatory waiting period for reassessment of oxygenation before enrolling patients with ARDS into clinical trials. 16 However, all trials performed to date in ARDS have enrolled patients within 24-72 h of ARDS onset [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and up to 7 days after meeting the AECC criteria. 23 24 It is possible that similar results could be obtained if patients were assessed after 12 or 18 h of routine clinical care, but our study design precludes us to speculate further. It is well accepted that in a high proportion of patients, lung function improves dramatically within the initial 24 h of usual care. Also, it is likely that within the initial 24 h, patients are not stable when routine therapies (ie, fluid resuscitation, sedation, muscle paralysis, antibiotics, insulin, catecholamine, blood transfusion, body positioning, intravascular catheterisation, repetitive and aggressive suctioning or secretions, insertion of chest tubes, selection of the best ventilatory pattern, etc) are implemented.",

If patients in a trial have a low risk of the condition that the intervention is hypothesised to prevent, the trial will not demonstrate the efficacy of the intervention, regardless of the trial size. 25 Stratification of enrolled patients can reduce the necessary sample size, since it makes larger treatment effects easier to detect. 26 That could explain why only one randomised controlled trial in patients with ARDS has been positive 27 since the publication of the ARDS net trial. In that study, only patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 threshold that persisted after 12-24 h under a specific level of PEEP and FiO 2 were enrolled. Recent highfrequency ventilation trials have been either ineffective or worse than usual care, 28 29 potentially due to a patient selection bias: both trials enrolled patients based on baseline PaO 2 /FiO 2 . These trials support the Furthermore, a recent autopsy study revealed that the Berlin criteria did not correlate with the presence of diffuse alveolar damage in more than 50% of patients categorised as moderate and severe ARDS. 32 However, this correlation improved significantly only when patients met PaO 2 /FiO 2 criteria beyond 24 h of persistence of ARDS criteria. Despite the fact that changes in the applied FiO 2 and PEEP induce profound variations in PaO 2 /FiO 2 , 9 33 by leaving the assessment of PaO 2 / FiO 2 criteria essentially unchanged, the AECC definition and the Berlin criteria are essentially identical. 2 34 The requirement of a minimum PEEP level of 5 cm H 2 O has no impact on the definition 9 since it is hard to conceive that an patient with ARDS would be managed with PEEP<5 cm H 2 O. 19 Our study has several strengths. First, our study design included all consecutive patients who met the criteria for moderate and severe ARDS, so we believe that our patients closely represented routine patients with ARDS. Second, patients were enrolled in a multidisciplinary network of teaching hospitals, not just one institution. Third, our stratification approach outperformed categorisation at baseline and categorisation at 24 h without standardisation of the measurement of PaO 2 /FiO 2 . On the other hand, we acknowledge a couple of limitations to this study. First, we did not enrol patients with mild ARDS under the Berlin criteria (PaO 2 /FiO 2 >200mm Hg). However, we do not believe that the exclusion of these patients weakens our results. Those meeting criteria for mild ARDS constitute a very heterogeneous group of patients who are usually underdiagnosed, representing a case-mix in which many do not require endotracheal intubation and invasive MV. Also, since PaO 2 /FiO 2 values in patients under non-invasive MV are not comparable with those on conventional MV, it is not clear whether patients meeting criteria for mild ARDS on non-invasive ventilation would meet those criteria after intubation and conventional MV. However, we are confident that no patients with mild ARDS were excluded during our observational periods if they moved to a more severe category, although we do not have data on the precise number of these patients. Second, we cannot expect our approach of risk stratification to hold for patients ventilated in a non-lung protective manner since it is clear that ventilation with large VT and high end-inspiratory plateau pressures causes ventilatorinduced lung injury in addition to the pre-existing ARDS, and we do not expect our approach to predict outcomes in this setting.",

Based on those values, patients with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264100 had a hospital mortality of 53.0%, patients with a 100<PaO 2 /FiO 2 <200 had a mortality of 39.8%, patients with a 200<PaO 2 /FiO 2 <300 had a mortality of 39.8% and those with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 >300 had a mortality of 16.7% ( p=0.064). When patients were reassessed under the SVS used in our study, PaO 2 /FiO 2 values changed and moved patients from one category to another. Despite 173 patients having a PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264100 mm Hg at ARDS onset, only 38.7% of them maintained the PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264100 mm Hg when assessed at 24 h under SVS (figure 1). Most patients diagnosed as severe ARDS by the Berlin criteria (106/173, 61.3%) were reclassified as moderate, mild and non-ARDS, when assessed after 24 h. Only 114 (23.8%) patients could not have their PEEP or FiO 2 level decreased to 10 cm H 2 O and 0.5 at the time of assessment, and their assignment was based on the PaO 2 /FiO 2 value under the clinician-selected PEEP and FiO 2 settings. Cohen's \u03ba analysis showed a very high disagreement between a patient's classification using Berlin criteria and assessment at 24 h under SVS: \u03ba=0.03 for moderate ARDS and \u03ba=0.29 for severe ARDS. Of note, 27.6% (132/478) of patients categorised at baseline as severe or moderate ARDS progressed with usual care to mild ARDS or non-ARDS when assessed under SVS, while 11.8% (36/305) of patients categorised as moderate ARDS by Berlin criteria progressed to severe ARDS when assessed under SVS.
