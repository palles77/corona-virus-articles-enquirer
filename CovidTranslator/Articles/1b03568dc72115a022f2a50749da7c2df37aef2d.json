In addition, the sequence of seroconversions can reveal whether infection by one HCoV protects from infection by other HCoVs. Study design: Two distinct study groups were monitored: healthy children and children hospitalized due to respiratory infection. HCoV natural infection rates in healthy children were obtained by serology in 25 newborns (followed 0-20 months). The frequencies of severe HCoVs infection was determined by real time RT-PCR among 1471 hospitalized infants (<2-years old) with acute respiratory tract disease. Results: The majority of healthy children seroconverted for HCoV-OC43 (n = 19) and HCoV-NL63 (n = 17), less for HCoV-HKU1 (n = 9) and HCoV-229E (n = 5). Notably, HCoV-HKU1 seroconversion was absent after HCoV-OC43 infection. Also HCoV-229E infection was rarely observed after HCoV-NL63 infection (1 out of 5). In the hospital 207 (14%) out of 1471 children were HCoV positive. Again we observed most infection by HCoV-OC43 (n = 85) and HCoV-NL63 (n = 60), followed by HCoV-HKU1 (n = 47) and HCoV-229E (n = 15). Conclusions: HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 infections occur frequently in early childhood, more often than HCoV-HKU1 or HCoV-229E infections. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 may elicit immunity that protects from subsequent HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E infection, respectively, which would explain why HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 are the most frequently infecting HCoVs. There are no indications that infection by one of the HCoVs is more pathogenic than others.",

Serum samples were obtained at birth, age 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, approximately 20 months, and for some also at approximately 24 months. Serum samples were stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. All newborns remained HIV-1 RNA negative and were HIV-1 seronegative during the follow-up period. Twenty-four of the 25 children were never hospitalized during the follow up period. One child was hospitalized in the first month of life due to an influenza infection. So none of the 25 children needed hospitalization at the moment they were infected by the HCoVs. Thirteen of the 25 newborns were part of a previous survey on HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E seroconversion. 10 Respiratory samples were not collected.

In a previous study we show that the carboxyl part of the N protein of 229E and NL63 elicit specific antibodies that allow differentiation between both species. 16 Given the shared structural and functional domain features among coronavirus N proteins we applied the same approach for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, since crossreactivity by the antibodies directed to the full-N of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 has been reported in human sera. [16] [17] [18] The HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E recombinant NCt proteins were produced as previously described. 12 The generation of the plasmid for NCt-OC43 and NCt-HKU1 was performed using the same method. Briefly, for NCt-OC43 the following primer combination was used 5 OC43 N5 CT (5 -CACCAGATTAGAGTTGGCCAAAGTG-3 ) and 3 OC43 Nexp (5 -TTATATTTCTGAGGTGTCTTCAGTATAG-3 ), whereas for NCt-HKU1 the primer combination 5 -HKU1 5N CT (5 -CACCAAATTAGACTTGGTTAAAAGAGTCCG-3 ) and 3 HKU1 Nexp (5 -TTAAGCAACAGAGTCTTCTACATAAG-3 ) was used. The generated pET100 OC43 NCt and pET100 HKU1 NCt plasmids were sequenced and shown to be 100% identical to the virus reference sequences of HCoV-HKU1 (Caen1, HM034837) and HCoV-OC43 (VR-759, AY391777), respectively. Subsequent expression and purification of the HCoV recombinant carboxyl-terminal N (NCt) proteins were performed exactly as described elsewhere. 10 The NCt proteins from HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, like those from HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, retained their immunogenicity in ELISA (checked with longitudinal sera from adults, or pooled human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg, Sanquin)). We performed competition experiments to ascertain specificity: positive human serum from adults or human IVIG was diluted (1:200) in PBST containing 1% skim milk, and twofold serial dilutions (ranging from 0 to 50 g/ml) of NCt protein of HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, or HCoV-HKU1 were added. The mixtures were briefly homogenized by vortexing prior to incubation for 1 h at RT. Following the preincubations, the samples were measured by either NL63-and 229E-ELISA or OC43-and HKU1-ELISA (so preincubated with the NCt form the other virus of the same genus). No cross reactivity was observed.",

This study covered 5 consecutive years, and children were included at two locations: The Netherlands and South-east of Scotland. Between December 2006 and February 2011 a total of 207 (14%) out of 1471 children were HCoV infected.

In healthy children high frequency of seroconversion towards HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 were detected, and to a lesser extent seroconversion to HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E. Serosurveillance of otherwise healthy individuals subverts bias for analyses of patients with higher severity of symptoms as is an inevitable consequence of hospital based studies, thus providing a much clearer representation of virus epidemiology in the community. These data provide the opportunity to compare the natural infection frequency of each HCoV with the frequency with which these viruses are found in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections within a community, something that has not been achieved previously. We investigated children who were hospitalized with acute respiratory tract illness, below the age of 2 years. This provides a selection of children with severe HCoV infections requiring hospitalization. Prevalence data in these hospital children and the serology in the healthy children are in complete accordance, revealing that there are no indications that any of the four HCoVs causes significantly more hospitalization than another. The characteristic frequency of infection, in the order HCoV-OC43 \u2265 HCoV-NL63 > HCoV-HKU1 \u2265 HCoV-229E, observed via seroconversion but also by direct detection of the virus in hospitalized children over multiple years is in contrast with some previous studies. Some studies addressed the frequency of HCoV infection during childhood and suggested that HCoV-NL63 infections were associated with more hospitalization compared to HCoV-OC43. 3, 19, 20 In the majority of the abovementioned studies only 1 year was sampled and for HCoVs a large year-to-year periodicity is known. 14, 21, 22 The significant differences of seroconversion rates between the coronaviruses observed here cannot be attributed to variable circulating frequencies as samples were collected over multiple years.",

The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed on the cumulative incidence of the percentage of seronegative individuals (y-axis) against time (in months; x-axis). Seroconversion to HCoV-NL63 is presented as a blue line, HCoV-OC43 as a green line, HCoV-229E as a black line and HCoV-HKU1 as a red line. (B) Hospitalized children: percentage of coronavirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 positive patients by age group as determined by viral RNA diagnostics. HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 are presented as a blue, green, black and red bar, respectively.
