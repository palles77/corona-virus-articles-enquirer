This represents a high risk for the development of a wide epidemic in Peru.",

The Cocoon Strategy involves vaccination of in-household contacts older than age 12 years (ie, adolescents and adults), puerpera mothers, and HCWs. 1, 5 The strategy is controversial. A World Health Organization position paper on pertussis vaccination published in 2010 6 and the final report of the XX Meeting of the Technical Advisory Group on Vaccine-Preventable Diseases of the Pan American Health Organization, 7 held in October 2012, both recommend not to perform this strategy because of lack of evidence. However, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 8 as well as recent research 9 suggest that cocooning is an effective measure in controlling the disease in the infants, the most important in-household contacts being the mother and the father. It is also important to consider that, in epidemiologic terms, any strategy that diminishes the number of potential infected contacts will reduce the probability of disease transmission. 10 The Cocoon Strategy has been implemented in countries around the world, including some Latin American countries. 5 For instance, Costa Rica implemented this strategy and found positive results with a reduction of cases and mortality rates in infants. 11 We believe cocooning is an important strategy that should be considered by health systemsdmore so in an outbreak settingdto maintain adequate standards of infant health. Further research on its efficacy needs to be performed in Latin America and other developing countries before it can be implemented as national policy.",

It is estimated that China has a poultry population of 14 billion, 70% to 80% of which is reared in backyards. 1 Densely populated southern China with backyard poultry farming practices has been a breeding ground for new influenza viruses. 2 At typical wet markets in China, poultry confined in stacked metal cages could facilitate the transmission of avian influenza viruses. Furthermore, open-air butchering could expose the workers and consumers to avian influenza viruses more easily. However, China is immature in implementing animal disease detection and monitoring. Moreover, obstacles to the timely reporting of animal disease outbreaks still exist. 2 It is true that individual farmers have few incentives to report sick or dead poultry. The fragmented nature of the agricultural sector makes regulation implementation difficult, as a number of food safety scandals have demonstrated in the last years. 3 There is no denying the fact that avian influenza remains a challenge to China during the post-SARS period. Even though China has learned a lot in the last 10 years, it is far from enough. The surveillance and reporting system for avian influenza in poultry has yet to be further improved.",
