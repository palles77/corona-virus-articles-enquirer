            "text": "Intensifying competition for air transportation passengers has led airports to research optimal designs and determine the infrastructure expansion capacities of their terminals. As a result, many researchers have studied this subject from a variety of perspectives. In this study, we propose an alternative methodology of determining the expansion of baggage carousel capacity over a series of steps that includes both a simulation and a cost-benefit analysis. The methodology consists of three stages. In the first stage, we forecast the volume of arriving passengers (excluding transfer passengers) and aircraft traffic with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Next, we conduct an elaborate analysis to estimate passenger delay using a discrete event simulation model in which we consider the conveyor load and the baggage carousel allocation to aircraft rates. Finally, we determine a plan to expand baggage carousel capacity that accounts for expansion costs and passenger benefits. Construction and conveyor costs were applied to expansion costs, and capacity expansion leads to passenger benefits due to reduced waiting time. Using a real case with 23 candidate baggage carousels at Incheon International Airport during 2013e2015, our experiments demonstrate the strength of the proposed methodology in planning appropriate capacity expansion that reflect the operational flow of passengers within the airport based on the future trend of passenger demand. In particular, our results show that carousel no. 18 should be expanded during the first quarter of 2013, carousels no. 17 and no. 19 should be expanded in 2014, and carousel no. 5 should be expanded in 2015 to obtain optimal benefit-cost ratios of 1.65, 1.79, and 1.76 for each year, respectively.",

Cause of this difficulty, several studies in this field has not considered passengers' practical flow in the airport terminal. Nevertheless, it is important to determine whether the entire utilizable area is considered when planning for terminal capacity expansion. Solak et al. (2009) developed a maximum delay function in passageways and processing stations for calculating the maximum walking times by accounting for density, free-flow walking speeds (264 ft/ min), and the length and width of passageways based on truncated Taylor series expansions (Rice, 1995) ; these authors suggested three approximations (triangular, parabolic and half-elliptical) to represent the shape of the peak for the processing stations. Suryani et al. (2010) calculated congestion with the M/G/1 queuing model that considers an arrival pattern of flights, service capacity, and runway capacity. Ronzani Borille and Correia (2013) incorporated arrival components into their simulation model and analyzed 720 scenarios that accounted for aircraft size, aircraft load factor, intervals between flights, passenger profiles, conveyor length, and differences in the arrival times of passengers and baggage at the conveyor belt.",

            "text": "An accurate airport passenger demand forecast can help reduce airport risk regarding both short-and long-term planning for airport facility expansion and other decisions. Several approaches have been used in the literature to forecast air passenger volume. In its Airport Development Reference Manual (ADRM), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) (2004) defined airport capacity and described the relation between the capacity of passenger terminal facilities and an airport's level of service. Scarpel (2013) applied an integrated mixture of local experts model (IMLEM) to forecast air passenger volume at S\u00e3o Paulo International Airport. The model was employed to address rapidly changing situations, i.e., when the time series presents turning points or any type of structural changes in the short term. Due to regional differences in input spaces, gross domestic product (GDP) growth was used as a leading indicator to forecast domestic passenger volume in the IMLEM. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to estimate the accuracy of the forecast (2.82%). Several authors have argued that MAPE should be avoided as a measure of forecast accuracy because it may treat forecast errors above the actual observation differently from those below the observation value (Armstrong and Collopy, 1992; Makridakis, 1993) . Suryani et al. (2010) forecasted air passenger demand for Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport utilizing a system dynamics framework. According to this study, air passenger demand is affected by both external and internal factors; airfare and level of service were considered as internal factors, and GDP and population growth were the external factors in the model. Using the relationships among these factors, they developed optimistic and pessimistic scenarios based on GDP growth. Tsui et al. (2014) developed seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) and ARIMA with exogenous input (ARIMAX) models to forecast the passenger volume for Hong-Kong International Airport from 11 principal originations using monthly time series data from the 1993e2010 period. These authors employed an intervention model to consider the effects of interventions and/or exogenous shocks (such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and international oil price fluctuations) on their SARIMA model. In addition, the ARIMAX model was computed to consider internal and external factors and shock effects in the cause-effect time series regression model. Chen et al. (2009) forecasted monthly passenger arrivals to Taiwan from Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States with HolteWinters, SARIMA, and Grey forecasting models and classified arriving passengers by their travel purposes, i.e., whether the passengers were traveling for tourist, non-tourist, or other reasons. These authors showed that the SARIMA model outperformed the HolteWinters and Grey models with respect to forecasting tourism passengers. Kulendran and Witt (2003) compared the accuracy of several forecast models, including the error correction model (ECM), the structural time series model (STSM), the basic structural model (BSM), and various ARIMA models. They forecasted international business passenger demand for Australia from New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan and showed that the ARIMA and BSM models outperformed other forecast models at short-term forecasting. According to Solak et al. (2009) , it is particularly difficult to build a holistic simulation model to analyze passenger flow in an airport terminal due to the complex structure of terminals and demand uncertainty. Most studies have either developed a generic model of the entire airport terminal or have narrowed their focus to an analysis of airport performance. Jim and Chang (1998) developed an airport passenger terminal simulation model using Simulation Language for Analogue Modeling II (SLAM II) and described passenger and baggage flows in the arrival and departure hall by considering a variety of input variables, such as aircraft type, domestic/international passengers and baggage, passenger group size, and passenger characteristics. Their model focused on an analysis of the general airport flow by including many elements of the entire terminal rather than analyzing details in a specific area. Freivalde and Lace (2008) analyzed the processes of check-in, security control, boarding control, and baggage sorting to find the bottleneck that was causing passenger congestion at the Riga International Airport. According to this study, the baggage sorting and security control areas were bottlenecks due to high passenger volume. The simulation model in this study employed an analysis time of approximately one hour and assumed that there were 100 passengers per flight and that passengers arrived regularly at baggage claim. Ronzani Borille and Correia (2013) compared Brazil's five airports using a service index that is calculated by using the available area around carousels, the number of arriving passengers at peak time, and the averaging waiting time; this study considered passenger profile, conveyor length, and interarrival time at baggage claim, as the main factors of influence when establishing operational activity-based scenarios.",

However, most studies have only focused on a particular area of the terminal capacity problem in a singleperiod approach based on short-term demand forecasts and have critical limitation with respect to including the characteristics of airport terminals which have complex structures and uncertain demand. In reality, it is difficult to develop an analytical model of passenger flow that can assist capacity expansion planning. Solak et al. (2009) developed time functions to approximate maximum delays in passageways and processing stations inside the airport terminal and employed these delay functions to build a multi-stage stochastic programming model based on a multi-commodity flow network representation of the entire airport terminal. In this model, infrastructure capacities and the width of passageways were determined subject to a given deterministic demand scenario and a fixed budget constraint. Suryani et al. (2010) used a system dynamics model to balance capacity and demand over the long term and considered future demand forecasts based on optimistic and pessimistic scenarios to decide when and how much an airport should expand its infrastructure capacity. Jorge and de Rusb (2004) performed an economic evaluation of a major investment in transportation infrastructure. When a project such as capacity expansion is to be implemented, it is necessary to identify and measure the benefits and costs during the project period to evaluate economic realities. These authors divided the benefits of airside and land-side investment into four categories: (i) reduced travel, (ii) improved service reliability, (iii) reduced operating costs, and (iv) increased traffic.

This simulation was used to measure the waiting time for picking up passengers' baggage at the baggage claim. During planning to expand baggage carousel capacity, we determined the start time, location, and quantity of expansion construction with a simulation-based heuristic search algorithm that reflected a cost-benefit analysis. In our search algorithm model, a baggage carousel is stopped for the duration of construction (3 months) after it is selected for expansion. Thus, although passenger waiting time decreases after construction, it increases at other baggage carousels during the construction period. Because of the fluctuation of demand and different aircraft allocation rates to each baggage carousel, it is important to consider the start time, location, and the quantity of expansion to answer the following key questions: 1) When is the proper period to expand a baggage carousel?; 2) Which baggage carousel should be expanded?; and 3) How many baggage carousels should we expand?",

In general, if the mean and variance of the data are non-stationary, natural logarithmic transformation and differencing is used to stabilize the data. The non-seasonal and seasonal unit roots are tested to identify the stationarity using the augmented Dick-eyeFuller (ADF) test, which is the most notable and commonly used test. The unit root test is used to examine whether a time series is stationary. If the time series contains a unit root, then it is non-stationary and subsequently must be transformed into a stationary series by removing the unit root(s). This objective can normally be reached by differencing the series. In practice, most time series can become stationary series by replacing the original data with a first difference. In the case of seasonality, a time series can become stationary after taking d non-seasonal differences and D seasonal difference. Table 3 summarizes the results of the unit root test for the 1st order differenced variables. The ADF statistics for the 1st difference variables are all significant at the 5% significance level, which demonstrates that these are stationary.",

We then used the AS-IS total over-waiting time (2,951,139.48 h) of the optimal expansion plan of one baggage carousel in 2014 to test the expansion test for two baggage carousels. The result was that the expansion of baggage carousels no. 17 and no. 19 was possible in 2014 (the B/C ratio \u00bc 1.79) and no. 5 in 2015 (B/C ratio \u00bc 1.76), respectively. According to the results, the expanded baggage carousels are included in gates with a high arrival rate and have a high allocation rate of baggage carousels. The allocation rate of baggage carousel no. 5 in gate B (25.59%) is 30.17%, and the allocation rate of baggage carousels nos. 17, 18, 19 in gate E (22.71%) is 22.22%, 30.64%, and 31.82%, respectively. Regarding expansion periods, all expansions occurred within a particular quarter of each year, and these periods had a relatively low passenger demand level.
