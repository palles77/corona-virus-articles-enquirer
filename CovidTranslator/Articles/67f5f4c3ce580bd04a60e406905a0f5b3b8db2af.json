The resolution asked Member States to establish disease burden estimation and surveillance and to contribute to the timely conduct of international risk assessments through the provision of relevant data and expertise. And specifically the resolution called upon the Director-General of WHO to help countries build relevant capacity to improve cross-sectoral collaboration along the whole food production chain and to establish with the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) an international initiative for the collaboration of laboratory partners in support of surveillance of FBD, identification of food contamination, and emergency response, including outbreak investigation.",

The most thorough normative change over the past decades in the food safety area has been the introduction of a formalized system to prepare and utilize science-based risk assessments to improve the safety of food, both at international and national level. For almost 20 years, WHO has promoted the new concept of risk analysis as a framework for the management of food production and food safety. Developed by WHO in collaboration with the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the risk analysis framework and principles are depicted in Figure 1 . Within this framework it is important to achieve functional separation of risk assessment (the science) and risk management (the intervention). The final goal of assessment should be to inform risk managers and other stakeholders of the nature, occurrence, and size of the risk in order to improve the quality of risk management decisions.",

The regional structure of WHO stems historically from the creation of WHO in 1948, where the preexisting Pan-American Health Organization was included in WHO as AMRO with an existing, independent governance structure. This independent structure was replicated in the other five regional offices, thereby creating an organization with not one, but seven politically appointed heads. In effect this means that each Regional Director is independently elected, and thus in effect can define policy course on his or her own. The regional offices receive approximately 75% of the WHO's budget and because regional directors are not appointed by or formally responsible to the WHO's Director-General, criticism has been voiced that some of the agency's activities are uncoordinated and not based on the best scientific evidence.",

At the third layer of the organization, the country offices, food safety is typically covered by staff, who also cover a number of other technical areas. Nevertheless, the WHO has been able to support significant development in national food safety programs, and shoulder a very significant work load in the area, primarily through the active support of -mostly nationally funded -scientists from all over the world.",

Under the administration of WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, WHO in the late 1990s introduced the 'farm-to-fork' collaborative line with FAO, a policy line mirrored by FAO. This did not mean that the two organizations necessarily agreed in all policy areas, but a cooperative effort was underlined in most areas of work. Following the major zoonotic outbreaks in the first decade of 2000, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, and type H1N1 influenza, the collaboration between FAO and WHO was extended to also include the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE).",

The continuing emergence, development, and spread of pathogenic microorganisms that are resistant to antimicrobials are a cause of increasing concern. WHO's involvement in the containment of AMR due to nonhuman antimicrobial usage dates back to the late 1990s, and includes the hosting of a number of expert meetings from 1997 to this day. Although the other relevant international organizations in this area -FAO and OIE -were not immediately supportive of the suggestions coming out of these expert meetings, through continued efforts from WHO the issue has since 2007 also been included in CAC work. These efforts have led to clear recommendations about prudent use of antimicrobials in animals as well as a description and selection of critically important antimicrobials. Whereas some recommendations have been implemented in some parts of the world, a very significant number of recommendations have not. In most countries, antimicrobials are still used as growth promoters, and veterinarians are still allowed to make profits from selling such drugs. 2. Acrylamide was until 2002 considered an occupational health issue only, as this substance had not been found in food. Therefore, it was considered dramatic news when Swedish researchers in March 2002 unveiled research showing very high concentrations of acrylamide in ordinary food items, such as French fries, bread, and coffee. Although some experts dismissed the importance of these findings -for example, with statements about how 'we have eaten these types of food for centuries' -WHO maintained a serious attitude toward these findings relative to a substance that had been proven carcinogenic in animals. Thus, a WHO/FAO expert consultation was undertaken less than 2 months after the Swedish news. The consultation considered that the available data suggested that toxicological findings in animals should be assumed to be relevant for extrapolation to humans. The consultation also provided a range of recommendations for further information and new studies to better understand the risk to human health posed by acrylamide in food.",

An INFOSAN Emergency Alert was distributed to the network and subsequently updates were issued regularly during the following months. A WHO Expert Meeting was held in collaboration with FAO a few months after the event unfolded in an effort to elucidate the normal ('baseline') exposure of humans to melamine, as well as suggest relevant tolerable daily intakes of melamine through food.",

Maybe the oldest written document about this, 'On Airs, Waters, and Places' is by Hippocrates that describes how human health is influenced by its interaction with the environment. A clear understanding of the importance of food and food safety for health led to the creation of the FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme in 1963, the active arm of which is the FAO/WHO the CAC. The CAC now meets once a year and agrees on food standards, guidelines, and codes of practice, typically developed in one of its 16 committees and task forces. However, the CAC system had become a very heavy system with significant bureaucracy. Realizing this, WHO and FAO in 2001 initiated an evaluation, resulting in some, but not very profound changes, including a higher level of inclusiveness especially toward developing countries. However, the system has also proven a capacity to move fast, even when dealing with politically charged issues. For example, the development of guidelines for the assessment of GM foods was finalized within a time period of only 4 years. When considering that such standards are developed based on several FAO/WHO expert meetings, as well as several task force meetings, many times with the participation of 50-70 countries, this is actually an impressive international achievement.",

The aim of these regulations is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health emergencies that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. Such public health emergencies include risks related to food, because diseases can spread far and wide via international food trade.

The full extent of the burden and cost of unsafe food is currently still unknown, but its impact on global health security, trade, and development is considered to be profound. Thus, valid estimations of the real FBD burden are basically nonexistent. Recognizing the current data gap, WHO has launched an Initiative to Estimate the Global Burden of FBDs from all major causes using summary health metrics that combine morbidity, mortality, and disability in the form of the disability-adjusted life year. This has been initiated through the establishment of the FBD Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG). The FERG members are mandated to engage in assembling, appraising, and reporting on currently existing burden of FBD estimates, conducting epidemiological reviews for mortality, morbidity, and disability in each of the major FBD, providing models for the estimation of FBD burden where data are lacking, developing source attribution models to estimate the proportion of diseases that are foodborne, and developing userfriendly tools for burden of FBD studies at country level.

The Global Environment Monitoring System-Food Contamination Monitoring and Assessment Program (GEMS/Food) was established in 1976 to inform national governments, CAC, and other stakeholders, as well as the public, on levels and trends of chemical contaminants in food and their contribution to dietary exposure. The program operates through a network of WHO Collaborating Centers and national institutions located in approximately 70 countries around the world. National data are submitted to GEMS/Food to conduct international scientific assessments of exposure, as part of chemical risk assessment. In addition, WHO has developed an approach to describe the various diets around the world. The GEMS/Food Consumption Cluster Diets were updated in 2006 and are now used both nationally and internationally for exposure assessment of food contaminants and pesticide residues (Figure 2 : WHO GEMS/Food Consumption Cluster Diets).",

The network promotes integrated, laboratorybased surveillance, and fosters intersectoral collaboration and communication among microbiologists and epidemiologists in human health, veterinary, and food-related disciplines. The network has been created with the support of some of the most respected national laboratories in these areas from a long list of WHO Member States, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands and the USA.",

By May 2012 the GFN included 1062 members from 184 Member States, and continuous activities covering: regional training courses on FBD surveillance, risk assessment and epidemiology, external quality assurance programs on microbiology, reference testing of selected foodborne pathogens, and provision of technical information and methodological support for microbiological laboratories. The GFN also hosts a country data bank with data on national Salmonella isolates from more than 83 countries comprising approximately 1.5 million human and 360 000 nonhuman isolates.",

            "text": "The future food safety systems will most likely enable new ways of evaluating disease metrics and attribute such disease directly to food groups. It is likely that new genetic fingerprinting techniques will enable attribution for all pathogenic microorganisms related to food, and new chemical fingerprinting (metabolomics) will enable a significantly better understanding of the effect of chemicals in food. At the same time the new line of risk-based approaches will enable the setting of national -and international -targets for disease reduction, as well as provide the evidence base for such reduction efforts. These approaches will make their way into all parts of the global market, including the developing countries, which are likely to become more and more important agricultural producers and exporters. The introduction of a riskbased framework will enable developing countries to learn from mistakes (and successes) elsewhere. These countries have the potential to 'leap forward' into preventative systems focusing on risks. In addition, at a time where trade restrictions and national/regional protection of the agricultural production through heavy subsidies is likely to come to an end, it will be of paramount importance for the production sector also in developing countries to adapt to the new times. The benefits of improving food safety amount to a 'win-win' situation with improved national health as well as improved export potential. However, it will be crucial for these potential future developments that the developments in new food safety systems is clearly documented and communicated. Such communication has not yet commenced; national authorities as well as international organizations have an important future task in this area.",

WHO is neither a funding agency nor an implementing agency like United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Instead, it should aim to be the paramount knowledge organization in global health -gathering up the best technical, scientific, and practical information and making it accessible to all countries. This does not mean that WHO products must necessarily only be theoretical analyses aimed at scientific debate. A very significant amount of WHO documentation is directly applicable in national food safety efforts. The information material about GM food ('20 Questions on GM Food'), the exchange of national experience in risk mitigation activities through INFOSAN, or indeed the global spread of the simple WHO message on safe food handling ('Five Keys to Safer Food') all are clear testament to the fact that if the core remains sound science, the application of practical support to countries can take many forms.",
