The median age of the patients was 49 years (IQR: 41-58) and 54 (64 %) were male. The self-reported symptom frequency ranged between 1 % for hepatitis/jaundice and 42 % for malaise, and 2 % of the cases had been hospitalized ( Table 1) . The median symptom score was 2 (IQR: 0-6). Table 2 presents the allele distribution of each SNP by using the two different classifications of \"symptomatic\" (at least one symptom and \"severe symptomatic\", i.e., a symptom score above the median score). The Dutch community control group consisted of 1,008 persons, of which 55 % was male. A statistically significant difference was observed for both IFNG SNPs when subjects who did not report any symptoms were compared to subjects who reported at least one symptom ( p=0.027). A similar result was found for one of the IFNG SNPs (rs1861493) when using the median symptom score as the cut-off (the A-allele was less frequently observed among the participants with the above median symptom score), while the other IFNG SNP (rs2430561) showed a trend in association in the same direction (the T-allele was less frequently observed among the participants with the above median symptom score), though it was no longer statistically significant. The GG genotype (rs1861493) and AA genotype (rs2430561) seemed to increase the symptom score (Fig. 1) , though the combination of both genotypes was not significantly associated with the two symptom classifications used. The other SNPs did not show an association with the symptom score. Therefore, the two IFNG SNPs were selected as the most likely candidates for reproduction of our results in study population 2. Compared with the general Dutch population, the A-allele of the IFNG rs1861493 SNP was more often present in participants with a low symptom score and less often in participants with a high symptom score; a borderline significant result was found for participants with a higher symptom score compared with the community controls (OR: 1.55; 95 % CI: 0.96-2.50; p=0.069).",

This A-allele has been reported to significantly increase the susceptibility to develop tuberculosis [10, [19] [20] [21] and SARS [11] . A dose-dependent association was found for this A-allele with susceptibility to SARS [11] . Pacheco et al. suggested that the increased levels of IFN\u03b3 in the early events during infection could probably control the replication and spread of M. tuberculosis or other intracellular pathogens [20] . With respect to disease severity, however, significant associations of the T-allele with a more severe acute sickness response to infection have been reported previously [12, 32] . This suggests that high or low levels of IFN\u03b3 can have different effects on disease, depending on the outcome under investigation. Fig. 1 Box plots of the IFNG genotype and symptom score in study populations 1 and 2: a IFNG rs1861493, b IFNG rs2430561. The numbers above the bars indicate the number of cases, the horizontal lines within the boxes represent the median symptom score, the lower and upper boundaries of the boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and the T-bars represent the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Outliers are indicated by the dots There are several explanations for our observation that findings from population 1 could not be reproduced in population 2. The first observation is that, surprisingly, symptom severity appeared to be much higher in population 2 compared to population 1, based on symptom scores and hospital admission rates (21 vs. 2 %). A possible explanation could be recall bias in study population 1, as participants were asked in September 2007 about their symptoms between 7 May 2007 and 8 July 2007. Nevertheless, the difference in symptom scores seems too large to be solely explained by recall bias in population 1. Furthermore, self-reported hospital admission rates seem highly unlikely to be affected by recall bias.",

A high C. burnetii dose in the environment is likely to lead to a higher probability of symptoms (i.e., a higher attack rate), even in less susceptible individuals. A dose-dependent attack rate has earlier been described for Salmonella infections in humans [33, 34] . A similar relationship for C. burnetii is suggested by experimental animal data [35] , and a human dose-response model for C. burnetii was recently published as well [36] . Evidence from these studies suggests that higher doses may be likely to overrule the immune system of the exposed person, resulting in an increased probability of illness. This hypothesis, in the light of the findings from our study, leads us to presume that a high dose will not only cause symptoms in the genetically susceptible individuals, but also in those genetically less prone to symptoms. In other words, the effects of heterogeneity in host susceptibility are diminished or even extinguished. Although we cannot exclude some influence of recall bias on our results of population 1, we presume that a higher C. burnetii dose was present in population 2 in 2009 compared to population 1 in 2007. Modeling studies investigating human exposure might give more insight in this hypothesis.",

This may be due to a loss in statistical power because of excluding a large number of subjects from our analysis.

Influenza, however, mostly occurs in winter and the incidence in spring was low in both years in the Netherlands [39] . Therefore, it is highly unlikely that other respiratory diseases played a major role in the two populations used for this study.",
