In Hong Kong, ribavirin and steroids have been used, and 74% of patients have recovered without requiring admission to the intensive care unit [4] . However, no control study has yet been conducted comparing ribavirin/steroid treatment with a placebo, and the potential efficacy of ribavirin against the SARS-coronavirus has been controversial. Many experts are also concerned about the side-effects of high-dose steroids.",

In a study of patients with Lassa fever in Nigeria, all eight patients who received convalescent plasma on or before day 10 of illness recovered and survived, while only three of eight patients who received plasma after day 10 survived [7] . In SARS, the viral load also peaks in the first week of infection [12] , and clinical deterioration in the third week is thought to be the result of inflammatory or hyperimmune attacks on lung tissue rather than direct viral-induced tissue damage. This was consistent with our finding of better clinical outcome in patients given convalescent plasma early in the course of the disease (i.e., before day 14, or during the viremic and seronegative stage).",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. (i) It was not randomized: whether or not patients received convalescent plasma was at the discretion of the attending physicians and according to plasma availability. Fluctuations in plasma availability also resulted in some patients receiving plasma earlier in the course of illness than others, but this allowed us to make an interesting comparison of the effects of early versus late plasma therapy. (ii) The amount of antibodies given to each patient was not standardized. This might have contributed to the variations in clinical outcome. (iii) Even though we did not observe any immediate adverse reactions, the potential risk of transfusion-transmitted infection was present. Ideally, convalescent plasma should go through a viral inactivation procedure before being infused into recipients. (iv) We did not have a placebo group for comparison. Although there were 12 patients whose condition deteriorated after methylprednisolone treatment and never received plasma therapy, these patients were given further doses of methylprednisolone, penta-globulin or other antiviral drug-like protease inhibitors. Using them for comparison, one may argue that methylprednisolone or another therapy may have a deleterious effect and convalescent plasma had minimal benefits or vice versa.",
