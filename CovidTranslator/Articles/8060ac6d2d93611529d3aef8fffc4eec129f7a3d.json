Currently, there are no effective treatments and no licensed vaccines; although a number of vaccine platforms have proven successful in animal models. The ideal filovirus vaccine candidate should be able to provide rapid protection following a single immunization, have the potential to work postexposure and be cross-reactive or multivalent against all Marburg virus strains and all relevant Ebola virus species and strains. Currently, there are multiple platforms that have provided prophylactic protection in nonhuman primates, including DNA, recombinant adenovirus serotype 5, recombinant human parainfluenza virus 3 and virus-like particles. In addition, a single platform, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus, has demonstrated both prophylactic and postexposure protection in nonhuman primates. These results demonstrate that achieving a vaccine that is protective against filoviruses is possible; the challenge now is to prove its safety and efficacy in order to obtain a vaccine that is ready for human use.",

By contrast, MARV contains a single species, Lake Victoria marburgvirus. See Figure 1 for the geographic locations of filovirus outbreaks. REBOV is the only species of EBOV that has not appeared in tropical Africa. It has been identified multiple times in cynomolgus macaques imported from the Philippines [18, 19] and in 2008, it was identified during a high incidence of pig mortality in the Philippines [20] [21] [22] [23] . While virulent in monkeys, REBOV has no apparent pathogenicity in humans, despite at least 25 cases of infection (0% case-fatality rate) [24, 25] . To date, there have only been two reported cases of CIEBOV (with no fatalities); therefore, REBOV and CIEBOV are of less concern regarding vaccine development. Thus, the minimal filovirus vaccine would be protective against all MARV strains and at least the three African EBOV species: ZEBOV, SEBOV and BEBOV.",

Mucosal exposure has also been demonstrated as a route of infection in experimentally exposed nonhuman primates [28, 29] . In addition, there are unconfirmed data that suggest an airborne route as the mode of transmission in a limited number of human cases [30] . Current data point toward a number of fruit bat species as the reservoir for both EBOV and MARV ( Figure 2 ) [31] [32] [33] [34] , suggesting that sporadic outbreaks of these viruses will continue as vector control is not a viable option.",

Two laboratory-acquired MARV infections (one fatal) have been reported in Russia (1988 and 1990) . Four known high-risk laboratory exposures to EBOV have been reported. The first occurred in the UK in 1976 (SEBOV), where following treatment with human interferon (IFN) and human convalescent plasma, the individual survived [35] [36] [37] . In two separate incidents in 2004, accidental needle sticks occurred while working with animals; one in the USA (mouse-adapted ZEBOV), where the person did not appear to be infected [38] , and one in Russia (guinea pig-adapted ZEBOV), where the infected individual did not survive [39] . Most recently (2009), a needle stick incident occurred while infecting animals with ZEBOV in Germany. It is uncertain whether this individual was actually infected; however, following postexposure vaccination with a live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP) [40, 41] , the individual did not exhibit any signs of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) [42] .

All vaccine platforms discussed here (DNA/rAd [45] , rAd alone, VLP [46] , rHPIV3 [47] and rVSV-based [41] ) have all reported that the production of virus-specific IgG antibodies correlates with protection in survivors. Furthermore, all vaccines that have resulted in 100% survival following challenge successfully induced antibody responses. As the pathophysiology and clinical symptoms of EBOV and MARV infection are accurately represented in the nonhuman primate model [7, 48] , this model meets the requirement of the animal rule [44] . Near-complete survival can be predicted if a certain IgG titer is produced in the rAd5 vaccine platform. This suggests that a specific threshold of IgG titer may be a useful correlate of protection [44] . Currently, it is unclear whether antibodies alone are sufficient for protection, as passive transfer of immune serum to naive nonhuman primates was not protective [49, 50] ; however, it has recently been reported that purified convalescent IgG successfully protected 100% of rhesus macaques from MARV challenge [51] . In the rodent models, where passive transfer is sufficient for protection [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] , adoptive transfer and knockout models have suggested that both B and T cells are mediators of protective immunity [57] .

For vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the general population has a low rate of exposure. Moreover, individuals that are seropositive generally have an immune response that is directed towards neutralizing VSV G, which is not present in these vaccine vectors [69, 70] . A modified HPIV3 vector, whereby its major surface proteins (fusion protein [F] and hemagglutinin [HN]) have been replaced exclusively with ZEBOV GP, also exploits this method of avoiding pre-existing immunity.

Animals vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV GP that survived challenge were back-challenged with SEBOV. All developed clinical symptoms and only one out of four survived. The survivor may be attributed to the SEBOV model not resulting in 100% lethality [78, 79] . Animals vaccinated with rVSV-MARV GP (strain Musoke) backchallenged with a different MARV strain (Popp) survived without apparent illness [41] . Animals vaccinated with rVSV-MARV GP and subsequently challenged with ZEBOV were not protected. Similarly, animals vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV GP and subsequently challenged with MARV were not protected. Together, these data suggest that within a filovirus species (e.g., MARV) there is cross-protection against different strains, but no cross-protection between species and genera (e.g., between MARV and ZEBOV or ZEBOV and SEBOV). Cross-protection between heterologous MARV strains has also been demonstrated in cynomolgus macaques that were protected from challenge strains Ravn (the most divergent MARV isolate) and Angola (the most virulent MARV isolate to date) when vaccinated 28 days prior with rVSV-MARV GP (strain Musoke) [69] . Both the rVSV-ZEBOV GP and rVSV-MARV GP vaccines were able to protect cynomolgus macaques from homologous aerosol challenge with ZEBOV and MARV, respectively [80] .",

Similar to other studies, the level of neutralizing antibodies was low by all routes of immunization, supporting the hypothesis that they are not solely critical for protection.

This illustrates that, in principle, it should be possible to generate a pan-filovirus rVSV-based blended vaccine. The addition of rVSV-BEBOV GP to the blended vaccine would have the potential to protect against all current filovirus species and strains of current importance to human health. The reusability of the rVSV platform has also been demonstrated, whereby rhesus macaques were vaccinated with rVSV-SEBOV GP and then vaccinated 2 weeks later with rVSV-ZEBOV GP and rVSV-MARV GP. The animals were protected from subsequent challenge with SEBOV and MARV, thus demonstrating the reusability of the rVSV vector [82] . As the exposed glycoproteins differ from each other and VSV G is not included in the construct, any neutralizing antibodies that are present should not interfere with the different vector constructs; however, the time frame between vaccinations may not have been sufficient for the development of antivector immunity. Regardless, these data suggest that separate immunizations could be used to generate immunity to multiple filoviruses, despite the convenience of a one-shot blended vaccine, which would be logistically superior.",

This indicates the robustness of protection, demonstrating that animals are completely protected from disease and is highly suggestive of sterile immunity. Following a single dose of rVSV, vaccinated animals typically have high anti-MARV or -EBOV IgG prior to challenge. There are also low levels of neutralizing antibodies in some animals; however, approximately half of the animals do not have neutralizing antibodies.

            "text": "Currently, the main criticism of the rVSV platform has been concerns over its safety, especially in immunocompromised individuals, as it is a replicating vaccine. One of the characteristics of the rVSV vaccine that reinforces these concerns is the consistent detection of transient low-level VSV viremia, typically noted on day 3 postvaccination. While this is not unexpected (as it is a replication-competent vaccine), it does suggest that the potential for vaccine-induced morbidity exists. Animal studies have suggested that rVSV vectors are safe, as rVSV-ZEBOV GP did not induce any signs of clinical illness in severely immunocompromised (nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient) mice, even when given ten-times the normal dose [52] . Moreover, no adverse effects have been reported in a variety of immunocompetent mice, outbred guinea pigs (strain Hartley), goats or hamsters [52, 70] [Feldmann H, Unpublished Data]. However, vaccination of STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 mice with rVSV vectors is lethal [Feldmann H, Unpublished Data] . Assessment of the toxicity of rVSV-HIV vaccines has demonstrated that rVSV is attenuated in nonhuman primates, which suggests that they would be safe to advance into Phase I clinical trials [83] . In addition, a major virulence factor in VSV is thought to be G, which is not included in the vaccine constructs. To date, over 90 macaques have been administered replicationcompetent rVSV vectors with no adverse effects (38 cynomolgus and three rhesus macaques with VSV-ZEBOV GP; 12 cynomolgus and three rhesus macaques with rVSV-SEBOV GP; 29 cynomolgus and three rhesus macaques with rVSV-MARV GP; and six cynomolgus macaques with rVSV-Lassa GPC) [40, 41, 69, [80] [81] [82] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] .",

Not only did these animals show no evidence of illness from vaccination, but four out of six were also protected from subsequent challenge with ZEBOV, demonstrating that this vaccine may also be effective in immunocompromised individuals. In these animals, there was a correlation between low CD4 + counts and a lethal outcome, suggesting that these cells may play a role in mediating protection. Low-level VSV viremia was detected on day 2 postvaccination in four out of six animals. Interestingly, the two animals with the most significant reduction in CD4 + cells following SHIV infection, the highest levels of SHIV viremia and that showed no evidence of VSV viremia did not survive challenge [85] . Two of the surviving animals showed no evidence of illness while the other two developed fever but few other clinical symptoms. None of the vaccinated animals developed IgG titers against ZEBOV GP by the time of ZEBOV challenge; however, IgG was detectable following infection in three animals. This suggests that the short-lived lowlevel VSV viremia may be important for protection, CD4 + cells play a role in protection and/or IgG antibodies may not be as important for protection as previously thought.",

            "text": "Populations at risk for EBOV and MARV infection are largely limited to accidental laboratory exposures and regions where natural filovirus outbreaks occur. However, as filoviruses occur over a wide geographic area and are unpredictable, it is difficult to determine a critical target population for vaccination campaigns. In the event that a filovirus is used as a biological weapon, any population could be at risk. Therefore, in the absence of an effective treatment, a postexposure vaccination would be an ideal treatment option. The utility of the rVSV platform as a postexposure treatment was determined in a study by Feldmann and colleagues [40] . rVSV-ZEBOV GP administered to guinea pigs and mice 24 h prior to challenge, 1 h postchallenge and 24 h postchallenge resulted in 67, 83 and 50% survival in guinea pigs, respectively, while all treated mice survived [40] . All guinea pigs showed weight loss and clinical symptoms; however, in those that did not survive, time to death was delayed. More importantly, rVSV-ZEBOV GP also protected 50% of rhesus macaques when administered 30 min following challenge [40] . While all macaques developed fever and lymphopenia, 50% of the animals did not progress to more severe disease, including alterations in clinical chemistry and macular rash. As noted previously, rVSV viremia was detected on day 3 postimmunization in most immunized animals [41] ; however, this did not correlate with survival [40] . ZEBOV viremia in survivors was 2-4 logs lower than in non-survivors and survivors developed low-titer IgM and moderate IgG antibody responses, as well as neutralizing antibody titers, while antibody responses were not detected in nonsurvivors [40] . Of note, animals treated with rVSV did not show a decrease in natural killer (NK) cells following challenge but instead showed a substantial increase. A postexposure treatment for SEBOV was also investigated. rVSV-SEBOV GP protected 100% of rhesus macaques when administered postexposure, following a lethal challenge with SEBOV [86] . This demonstrates that 100% postexposure protection is possible.",

It will be interesting to determine whether rVSV is also as efficacious postexposure against heterologous MARV strains, most notably Angola, which results in a time to death that is similar to that of ZEBOV. As both EBOV and MARV infections appear to progress somewhat slower in humans than in nonhuman primates, this would suggest that the therapeutic window for postexposure treatment in humans may be longer. Furthermore, the challenge dose used in rVSV trials represents approximately 1000 lethal dose 50 (LD 50 ) [89] , which under almost all circumstances is higher than what would be expected from laboratory or direct contact exposures. In future studies, it will be interesting to see if a blended vaccine (similar to that used for prophylactic protection) has the ability to also work postexposure.",

In HPIV3-immune guinea pigs, despite restriction of rHPIV3-ZEBOV GP replication by HPIV3 neutralizing antibodies, these animals produced ZEBOV GP-specific antibodies at nearly the same level as HPIV3-naive animals [94] . In HPIV3-immune rhesus macaques, the antibody response to ZEBOV GP was substantially lower when compared with HPIV3-naive animals following the first immunization. However, the antibody response was comparable between HPIV3-naive and -immune animals following a second immunization [65] , achieving a level that has been previously characterized as being required for 100% protection in this model [47] . Unfortunately, there is no report of these animals being challenged to demonstrate that pre-existing immunity does not interfere with protection from challenge. In order to circumvent pre-existing vector immunity, a construct that does not contain the F or HN gene of HPIV3 was developed that solely expresses ZEBOV GP on its surface. While its replication in guinea pig lungs appeared to be even more restricted, a single immunization was sufficient to protect guinea pigs from lethal ZEBOV challenge and induced an immune response comparable to previous constructs [62] . This construct was able to incorporate twofold more ZEBOV GP into virus particles and also appears to be even more attenuated than the complete rHPIV3 vector used in previous experiments.

Genetic-based vaccines can also be rapidly altered as pathogens evolve, cross species barriers or are intentionally modified [102] . In clinical trials, DNA vaccines appear to have a very good safety profile; however, their immunogenicity has been less than desirable [101, 103, 104] .

A multivalent or a blended vaccine can provide protection against multiple species; however, this adds additional complexity and would not necessarily provide protection against newly emerging species. While four species of EBOV have been definitively established, a new species, BEBOV, emerged in 2007 [17] . Based on previous data from the blended vaccine (rVSV) or the multivalent DNA/rAd5 vaccine, neither platform would be expected to be protective against a new species. However, it was recently reported that the DNA/rAd5 vaccine that expresses the GPs of both ZEBOV and SEBOV was able to provide 100% protection against challenge with BEBOV, despite a sequence difference of 38-47% at the amino acid level [109] . While the mechanism providing cross-protection is not clear, it is speculated that the prime-boost regimen elicits a stronger immune response (with one magnitude increase in antibody titers). In addition, BEBOV appears to be less pathogenic than either ZEBOV or SEBOV (based on time to death in nonhuman primates, the case-fatality rates in the human outbreak and the observance of one survivor out of four in the control group) [109] . There was no evidence of IgG cross-reactivity with BEBOV; therefore, despite extremely high titers (1/40,000), antibodies do not seem to be the mechanism of protection. CD4 + and CD8 + cells were stimulated with BEBOV peptides but to a lesser extent than ZEBOV peptides. The animal with the lowest CD8 + stimulation showed the greatest symptoms of disease, including elevated liver enzymes and detectable viremia on day 6. This suggests that a cellular response may be involved in cross-protection. While this is the first description of crossprotection between EBOV species in this system, the vaccination regimen included four DNA immunizations and one rAd5 boost over the course of nearly 1.5 years. Unfortunately, this vaccination schedule is not practical for use in filovirus-endemic regions where vaccine delivery is logistically challenging.",

To overcome this, different serotypes of adenovirus have been used. A chimpanzee-based adenovirus vaccine (AdC7) expressing ZEBOV GP stimulated robust T-and B-cell responses against ZEBOV in naive mice, inducing complete protection from homologous lethal challenge [64] . This platform was also able to protect 100% of guinea pigs from challenge, with a relatively low vaccine dose of 5 \u00d7 10 9 particles/kg. Pre-existing immunity to Ad5 in mice did not affect the efficacy of the vaccine, suggesting it has potential to be used in order to circumvent pre-existing immunity. Similarly, a chimeric simian adenovirus AdC5/C1 expressing ZEBOV GP was generated (AdC5/C1 ZEBOV GP). As described for other Ad constructs, it induced ZEBOV GP-specific T-and B-cell responses. These were of a lower magnitude compared with rAd5 constructs; however, the total IgG response to ZEBOV GP was comparable. A single administration of AdC5/C1 ZEBOV protected mice from lethal challenge [63] . Rhesus macaques vaccinated with AdC5/C1 ZEBOV GP also mounted T-cell and antibody responses to ZEBOV GP. While this appears to be a successful strategy to avoid pre-existing immunity, the utility of these vectors has yet to be demonstrated in a nonhuman primate challenge model.",

In an effort to develop a pan-filovirus vaccine, hybrid VLPs that incorporated both ZEBOV and MARV GP with either MARV or ZEBOV VP40 were generated. These hybrid VLPs were not effective at protecting against heterologous challenge; however, a blended vaccine with Ribi adjuvant containing both ZEBOV and MARV GP/VP40 VLPs provided a high level of protection from challenge with either ZEBOV (90% survival) or MARV (100% survival) in guinea pigs [122] . The efficacy of VLPs in nonhuman primates has been demonstrated for both MARV and ZEBOV. Cynomolgus macaques immunized with three doses of ZEBOV VLPs containing GP, NP and VP40 and Ribi adjuvant resulted in survival of all animals without signs of illness or viremia [46] . While MARV-Musoke GP, NP and VP40 VLPs with QS-21 adjuvant were shown to provide protection against challenge by other MARV strains including Angola, Ravn and Ci67 in cynomolgus macaques [123] ; however, animals challenged with Ravn showed sign of illness. Production of VLPs in mammalian cells is expensive; therefore, alternative production methods have been investigated. ZEBOV VLPs produced in insect cells via baculovirus expression were shown to have comparable immunogenicity to mammalian-produced VLPs [124] .

An increase in the CD8 + Tcell response was also noted following two immunizations. All mice immunized twice with 10 6 Ebola \u0394VP30-neo survived subsequent challenge with mouse-adapted ZEBOV and showed no evidence of illness [127] .

Only high-risk groups, such as specific populations in equatorial Africa, would probably be targeted for vaccination as there is currently no demonstrated need for wider coverage. As MARV outbreaks have been both temporally and geographically sporadic, determining regions for prophylactic vaccination is extremely difficult. In EBOV endemic areas (i.e., eastern Gabon, western Republic of Congo, a large portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and part of Uganda) a widespread vaccination campaign could be considered. Including protection against MARV in these populations is not without merit as there is overlap between the viruses in these regions. As human MARV infections have been associated with visits to caves around Mount Elgon, near the Kenya/Sudan border, appropriate education and precautions should be considered at this time, rather than vaccination. International aid workers who work in endemic regions or respond to disease outbreaks in equatorial Africa would also benefit from prophylactic vaccination. The other priority population would be laboratory workers who handle these agents. Additional populations that may benefit from prophylactic vaccination would include first responders, front-line hospital staff and military personnel. While a prophylactic vaccine is desirable, the logistics of ensuring good vaccine coverage in equatorial Africa are difficult. This makes a rapid-acting and/or postexposure vaccine desirable as it would have the potential to decrease the case-fatality rates and prevent further spread of disease during an outbreak. This would also be the most useful strategy to minimize fatalities following a bioterrorism event.",

While the DNA vaccine alone has been tested in a Phase I clinical trial, its immunogenicity is less than desirable and it requires multiple immunizations over a long time period. The requirement for multiple immunizations makes this platform difficult to implement in filovirus-endemic regions, where vaccination of the entire population is probably logistically and financially impossible. However, it may be useful for vaccinating individuals with high potential exposure risks (e.g. biosafety level-4 workers, front-line hospital staff/first responders and members of agencies who work in endemic areas). While these groups are useful targets for vaccination, the most at-risk population would be unlikely to benefit from such a vaccine. The addition of rAd5 in a prime-boost regimen or rAd5 alone is probably of more utility; however, a method to overcome pre-existing Ad5 immunity has not been definitely proven in the nonhuman primate model. Multiple options to avoid or circumvent pre-existing immunity while still using an Ad vector have been presented, although none of these methods has been thoroughly tested in a nonhuman primate challenge model.

Its demonstrated effectiveness following a single dose should be a significant advantage for providing vaccinations to target populations in central Africa. Furthermore, a vaccine that works both pre-and postexposure with a relatively short time to immunity could be stored until required (i.e., laboratory exposure, bioterrorism or outbreaks) and then be rapidly implemented as needed.

The limited interest by industry, given a lack of a profit for such vaccines, is another inhibiting factor. Thus, government agencies need to provide the funding for vaccine development in this field. An imminent use is obvious in the high containment field, which is anxiously awaiting treatment and/or vaccine options for its workers. Therefore, pre-investigational new drug (IND) approval should be considered for the most promising platforms. This, however, would trigger further requests from aid agencies and the military who have already indicated interest in protecting their staff. The availability of pre-IND approved vaccines would also probably create an ethical dilemma with governments, healthcare providers and populations in the affected endemic central African countries who are most in need of vaccines and treatment options. In the absence of well-defined correlates of protection, establishing clinical trials that meet current standards will be difficult in these areas and probably controversial. Overall, this means that the availability of a filovirus vaccine will probably remain unrealistic within the next 5 years.

Multiple outbreaks have been associated with locations where contact with or the consumption of bats has occurred. Contact with infected nonhuman primates, typically as bush meat, has also been a suspected source of infection. While the mechanism of transmission from bats to humans and nonhuman primates is not known, transmission from nonhuman primates to humans is likely through contact with blood and tissues during butchering or from bites and scratches. Transmission between humans probably occurs via direct contact with blood or secretions; however, there is limited evidence of aerosol transmission. In the event of an act of bioterrorism the most likely route of infection would be by the aerosol route.",
