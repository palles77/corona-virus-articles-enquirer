Indeed, most lines exhibited 166 modest weight gain over the 14 day experiment, and the rate of weight gain was no slower in 167 infected mice than in mock-infected controls. None of the mice exhibited disease signs consistent 168 with those observed in IFN-deficient mice (e.g. hunching, ruffled fur, paralysis, or encephalitis). 169 CC051 and CC059 share more genetic similarities than average pairs of CC mice, so phenotypes 170 that differ between these two lines may be especially easy to map by quantitative trait locus (QTL) 171 analysis. Because 5-week-old CC059 mice exhibited slightly slower weight gain after ZIKV 172 infection compared to mock-infected mice, whereas ZIKV infection had no effect on the rate of 173 weight gain in CC051 mice, we tested ZIKV infection in weanlings of these 2 lines. We reasoned 174 that because 3-week-old mice gain weight at a faster rate than 5-week-old mice, they may reveal 175 phenotypes that are not evident in 5-week-old mice. However, while we found that 3-week-old 176 mice indeed gained weight at a faster rate than 5-week-old mice, there was no difference in the 177 rate of weight gain in mice infected with ZIKV Dakar-MA compared to mock-infected, for either 178 CC051 or CC059 (Figure 2) .

The restriction of ZIKV replication in mice 241 results in part from an inability of ZIKV NS5 to degrade murine STAT2 and therefore ZIKV cannot 242 inhibit IFN signaling in mice by the same mechanism used in human cells (5, 6). However, NS5-243 mediated antagonism restricts antiviral signaling only in infected cells whereas these responses 244 are sustained in uninfected cells responding to paracrine IFN signaling. Thus, Stat2 -/mice 245 succumb to ZIKV infection, but transgenic mice expressing human STAT2 only exhibit disease in 246 the context of ZIKV strains with additional mouse-adaptive mutations (4, 44).
