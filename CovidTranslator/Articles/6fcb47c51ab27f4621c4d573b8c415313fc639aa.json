Efficient conversions were observed with Pd(OAc) 2 /Xantphos/Cs 2 CO 3 , in PhMe at 100 \u00b0C. Reactions of the bromo nucleoside derivatives could be conducted at a lowered catalytic loading (5 mol % Pd(OAc) 2 /7.5 mol % Xantphos), whereas good product yields were obtained with a higher catalyst load (10 mol % Pd(OAc) 2 /15 mol % Xantphos) when the chloro analogue was employed. Among the examples evaluated, silyl protection for the hydroxyls appears better as compared to acetyl. The methodology has been evaluated via reactions with a variety of aryl amines and by synthesis of biologically relevant deoxyadenosine and adenosine dimers. This is the first detailed analysis of aryl amination reactions of 6-chloropurine nucleosides, and comparison of the two halogenated nucleoside substrates.",

            "text": "Palladium-catalyzed C-N bond forming reactions have become an important type of transformation in the synthetic repertoire. [1] In this context, we have been gaining an understanding of and exploiting such catalyzed amination reactions of nucleosides. [2] The high biochemical, physiological and medicinal value of compounds that can arise by alteration of the nucleoside scaffold adds significant importance to the development of methods for nucleoside modification. [3, 4] In 1999 we demonstrated, for the first time, that N6-aryl 2 '-deoxyadenosine analogues could be efficiently synthesized via C-N bond-formation using a suitable Pd-ligand complex. [5] Subsequently, we analyzed a series of ligands for C-C and C-N bond formation. [6] This led to the identification of specific ligands that were effective for aryl amination. These included 2-(cyclohexylphosphino)-2'-(N,N-dimethylamino)-1,1'-biphenyl and (\u00b1)-BINAP. In subsequent aryl amination work the same two ligands also proved to be useful in gaining access to N 6 -(6-benzo[a]pyrenyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine. [7] In all these cases, the halopurine nucleoside tested and used was 6-bromo-9-[2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl]purine. In comparison, there are fewer analyses of the use of the 6-chloropurine nucleoside analogues in Pd-mediated amination reactions. Among these, reactions of 6-chloro-9-[2,3,5-tri-O-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl] purine using Pd 2 (dba) 3 /BINAP with either Cs 2 CO 3 or t-BuOK were evaluated. [8] Although reactions of alkyl amines proceeded well, comparable reactions of aryl amines were not efficient. Using Pd(OAc) 2 /(\u00b1)-BINAP/Cs 2 CO 3 we have studied the amination of silylprotected 6-chloro-9-[2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl]purine with a sterically-demanding alkyl amino derivative of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. [9] Subsequently we have synthesized more elaborate carcinogen-nucleoside adducts using this chloro nucleoside. [10] We have also studied C-N(sp 2 ) bond-forming reactions of 6-bromo and 6-chloropurine nucleosides with azoles. [11] Despite these results, there has not been the development of effective Pd-catalyzed aryl amination methods to involve 6-chloropurine nucleosides. Also, no comparative performance evaluation of 6-bromo and 6-chloropurine nucleosides under Pd-catalyzed aryl amination conditions has been conducted. In this context it should be noted that S N Ar displacement reactions between a 6-bromopurine nucleoside and two aryl amines have been accomplished, but reactions of corresponding 6-chloro compound are stated to be ineffective. [12] Pd catalysis appears to offer a simple, unifying method for involving both 6-bromo and 6chloropurine nucleosides in aryl amination reactions. This paper reports our studies on such reactions of these nucleoside derivatives.",

[13] Chloro nucleoside 2a [14] was prepared by silylation of 6-chloro-9-(2-deoxy-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl)purine [15] whereas 2b [11, 16] and 2c were prepared by silylation and acetylation of commercially available 6chloro-9-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl)purine. Alternatively, 2c can be prepared by chlorination of inosine triacetate. [17] With these compounds, we began to evaluate conditions for aryl amination. We selected six ligands, 2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-2'-N,N-(dimethylamino)-1,1'-biphenyl (L1), (\u00b1)-BINAP (L2), Xantphos (L3), 2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl (L4), 2-(di-tbutylphosphino)biphenyl (L5) and 4-(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (L6) shown in Figure 2 . The first three were chosen since these have previously yielded effective amination catalysts for nucleosides, [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] whereas L4 and L5 were included due to their similarity to L1.

The Pd-catalyzed reactions of 1b produced comparable yields to displacement reactions on 1c, [12] but require 3 times less aryl amine. Also, Pd-catalyzed reactions with the chloro nucleosides resulted in amination products, whereas such chloro nucleosides were reported to be unreactive under S N Ar conditions. [12] Arylation of nucleosides by aryl bromides had been challenging until our recent report. [24] Thus, reactivity properties of nucleosides often do not follow known trends of simpler aryl systems. With the reactions of the simple aryl amines completed, we next analyzed the use of nucleosides themselves as the aryl amine in coupling reactions with the halo nucleosides. Nucleoside dimers are of interest since they can be formed in vitro by nitrous acid induced DNA cross-linking. Such a process could have a physiological role due to the presence of nitrite in cured meats. [26, 27] Pd-catalyzed approaches have been used for the non-biomimetic synthesis of adducts produced by DNA cross linking. [28, 29] Among the various nucleoside dimers, deoxyguanosine-deoxyguanosine (dG-dG), deoxyadenosine-deoxyguanosine (dA-dG), and deoxyadenosine-deoxyadenosine (dA-dA), synthesis of dA-dA posed particular challenges. For instance, reaction of 1a and 5a using several Pd/L2 complexes were reported to be low yielding, and thus use of the iodo analogue of 1a was necessary. [29] On the basis of our results, we wanted to reassess the reaction of 1a with 5a and analyze reactivity of the chloro analogue 2a for synthesis of dA-dA dimer. We also wanted to compare these reactions to those leading to the adenosine-adenosine (A-A, ribose) dimers (Scheme 1). The results of these experiments are shown in Table 3 .",

The deprotected compounds from this study as well as those obtained from previously synthesized compounds [11, 23, 30] were subjected to a wide variety of antiviral assays. Unfortunately, none showed specifically interesting activity at subtoxic concentrations as shown in Tables S2-S5 of the Supporting Information. Instead, several compounds showed a mild cytostatic and/or cytotoxic activity against a variety of cell lines (CC 50 or MIC in the 10-to 100-\u03bcg/mL range). Only the desilylated product from 4f was endowed with a marked cytostatic activity against CRFK cells (CC 50 : 4.32 \u03bcM). This compound should be further explored for its potential antiproliferative activity against a broad variety of tumor cell lines. Pd-catalyzed C-N and C-C bond-forming reactions have led to this diverse set of compounds for antiviral and cytostatic analysis that would otherwise not be available.",

Herein we show that 5 mol % Pd(OAc) 2 /7.5 mol % Xantphos is a generally effective catalyst in combination with Cs 2 CO 3 in PhMe at 100 \u00b0C for reactions of 6-bromopurine ribonucleosides as well as the 2'-deoxy analogues. Remarkably, the corresponding 6-chloropurine nucleosides are also excellent substrates for such reactions, requiring 10 mol % Pd(OAc) 2 /15 mol % Xantphos, under otherwise comparable conditions. Finally, the method has been applied to the synthesis of deoxyadenosine-deoxyadenosine and adenosine-adenosine dimers. Bromo-as well as chloropurine ribo and deoxyribonucleosides are effective substrates for reactions with protected 2 '-deoxyadenosine and adenosine. Therefore, the methodology described appears to present broad generality and scope for nucleoside modification with both 6-bromo and 6chloropurine nucleosides.",
