            "text": "Maurice Ralph Hilleman (1919\u00c02005) was one of the greatest microbiologists/vaccinologists of all time. He played a key role in developing vaccines for Asian flu in 1957 and Hong Kong flu in 1968. Over six decades, most of which were spent at Merck & Company, his leadership and innovations blazed new trails in virology, epidemiology, immunology, cancer research, and vaccine development that were unmatched. His work resulted in current vaccines used for the prevention of measles, mumps, hepatitis A and B, chickenpox, meningitis, and pneumonia, which have saved millions of lives across the globe. The need for close cooperation between public and private agencies, including donors, to promote research in vaccinology is reemphasized by recent global health crises such as the Ebola and Zika viruses, as well as the annual influenza virus threats. Eradication of many diseases is feasible, but requires political support for resources, vaccine development and harmonization of vaccination policies, to be achievable. Hilleman worked with many collaborators in academic centers, in industrial management, with which he led his research and development team to produce world-changing achievements.",

Influenza remained a yearly occurrence after the horrendous 1918 Swine Flu pandemic which killed tens of millions of people, primarily young men. But no new, virulent influenza type emerged until early 1957. In February 1957, a life-threatening wave of flu was spreading across China with reports of 20,000 cases in Hong Kong. Then still a microbiologist at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Hilleman suspected this could become a pandemic threat and coined the term Asian flu. He obtained a sample of the virus from an ill US serviceman and determined that most people lacked antibody protection for this new influenza virus. He initiated vaccine production by sending virus samples to manufacturers and urging them to develop a vaccine within four months, producing 40 million doses of vaccine and so reducing the US epidemic, which caused an estimated 70,000 deaths in the United States. World-wide, from 1957 to 1958, some two million people died from Asian flu. Subsequently new influenza strains have continuously emerged in Asia.",

He continued studying and received his master's degree in 1953, and was awarded full scholarship toward a PhD in medical microbiology and chemistry. Working at the University of Texas in Galveston from 1956 to 1958, Hayflick learned techniques of cell cultures producing large numbers of selected cells with long term survival and replication living in controlled conditions. Fetal cells were considered safer than other cell lines as the latter could be genetically abnormal, contain undetected viruses such as those of animal origin, or carry cancer genes. The famous HeLa cell line was the oldest and most commonly used human cell line derived from cervical cancer cells from Henrietta Lacks, a patient who died of her cancer in 1951. The cell line, extremely readily grown and survivable, was used extensively in scientific research including production of the inactivated Salk vaccine in 1954. Considerable controversy surrounds this even today because the sample was taken without the patient's permission and because of the possibility of its carrying cancer genetic material.",

The Hayflick strain developed at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia called WI-38 was widely accepted as an alternative to primary monkey kidney and HeLa cells. WI-38 provided a cell line from normal human embryonic tissues with a normal chromosomal constitution with no transfer of tumors in animal models. This cell strain was accepted in Europe where Hayflick's WI-38 cell line was approved for use in vaccines. Since the 1960s, WI-38 became the most widely used and highly characterized normal human cell population in the world. WI-38 was provided by Hayflick to Stanley Plotkin for use for the development of a new rubella virus growth and its resultant vaccine, licensed in 1970. WI-38 was also used in the production of the first oral polio vaccine made on a continuously propagated cell strain. Hayflick is renowned as a professor of gerontological studies at the University of California, San Francisco. His landmark studies are characterized as \"Hayflick Limit\" in cellular ageing and basic longevity studies. His contribution to vaccinology is the WI-38 cell line along with chick embryo cells which have been used for the manufacture of most human virus vaccines world-wide. Vaccines using WI-38 cells have immunized many hundreds of millions of people, include oral poliomyelitis (Sabin), measles, rubella, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses, and hepatitis A vaccines. Hilleman and his team using WI-38 cells developed the majority of the 14 vaccines currently recommended for childhood routine immunization and led in the development of other vaccines. In 1968, Hilleman produced a more attenuated measles vaccine derived from the virus isolated by John Enders in 1962, which is still used today. The Hillman rubella vaccine was also more attenuated i.e., less likely to cause the disease but still induce antibodies in the vaccinated person than the 1962 vaccine and remains in use today. In 1963, Hilleman isolated the mumps virus from a throat swab from his five-year old daughter and developed a new vaccine, which was licensed in 1967, and was officially named \"Jeryl Lynn\" after her. Hilleman's iconic Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) combination vaccine was licensed by the FDA in 1971, and is used worldwide. Hilleman also produced the 1967 Hong Kong A2 pandemic influenza vaccine and the meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine, which was licensed in 1974.",

In 1983, the vaccine was extended to include 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria based on the work of selection by Robert Austrian-University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine-who isolated cell lines from more than 90 types of pneumococcal bacteria as types most appropriate for the vaccine. Austrian provided this information to Hilleman who, with associates at Merck, then developed the vaccine from the polysaccharide outer coatings of the bacteria (College of Physicians of Philadelphia, Vaccine Timeline, 2016).",

The measles vaccine went through a long process of development with many key players, including John Enders and Samuel L. Katz, who isolated measles virus in a blood sample from 13-year-old David Edmonston, subsequently called the \"Edmonston strain.\" Working with other scientists, Enders and Katz turned this strain into a vaccine licensed in the United States in 1963. This was an attenuated i.e., using a live, but weakened, measles strain so that it would not cause the disease, but rather act as a vaccine by promoting the production of sufficient antibodies to protect against subsequent exposure to the natural measles virus. In 1968, Hilleman and colleagues developed and further improved the \"Edmonston-Enders\" strain, which remains the primary measles vaccine used in the United States. In 1981 Hilleman developed the first viral subunit vaccine based on the work of Baruch Blumberg and Wolf Szmuness on the Australian antigen, a cell membrane surface protein of the hepatitis B virus, rather than the entire virus, producing a vaccine licensed in 1986. Hepatitis B recombinant vaccine is inexpensive to produce and is used worldwide for newborns to prevent later development of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.",

This also provided hope for faster vaccine response to emerging infectious agents. In 1987 Hilleman produced and the first US FDA licensed congugate vaccine based on fat from the bacterial cell wall attached to a protein to produce Hemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccine. This vaccine protects against this serious respiratory infection in babies aged 0-18 months with dramatic reductions in cases and deaths within a few years. Hilleman also developed varicella (chicken pox) and hepatitis A vaccines-both licensed in 1995-with important public health benefits.",

Levels of immunization coverage required for herd immunity can vary for different disease organisms, but in the case of measles it requires over 95 percent immunization coverage over a long period of time by an adequate two-dose policy, with monitoring, funding, and quality assurance for immunization programs. Adequacy means coverage of the population at risk of the disease as groups with inadequate vaccination become unexpectedly vulnerable as, for example, in recent importation and spread of measles and mumps in the Americas where these diseases had previously been considered eliminated. New challenges emerge requiring increasing vaccination coverage including tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and influenza for pregnant women, and their family members and care givers to protect newborns who are vulnerable until their immunization can be completed. Herd immunity (i.e., immunity by vaccination among a high percentage of a population sufficient to reduce the risk of transmission by isolated cases which varies for different diseases) must be achieved and maintained to reduce the potential for transmission of a disease to vulnerable people such as people with immune deficiency due to infection with HIV, cancer chemotherapy, or immunodeficiency diseases. In other cases, giving rubella vaccine to boys as well as girls to reduce or eliminate circulation of the virus prevents infections during pregnancy, which can lead to congenital rubella syndrome in infants, a disease that can result in lifelong disability (see Chapters 3, 12, 16) .",

The cases of measles and hepatitis B are prime examples of vaccines that have been developed in partnership with many contributing laboratories, manufacturers and public health leaders with shared information and scientific advances leading to reduced global mortality rates. Scientists and manufacturers worked together to create the HBV vaccine produced by using one element of the cellular wall of the virus instead of the whole virus, increasing the safety of the vaccine. Hilleman later developed the first immunizations with recombinant vaccines, contributing to the application of advances in genetic sciences for vaccinology in the future to provide low-cost and widely effective new approaches to vaccination.",

He introduced new approaches to vaccinology which others following his path can use help to control-or eliminate-important diseases now, and others that in the future may face humanity. Hopefully \"new Hillemans\" will emerge to advance the sciences of genetics and vaccinology to face existing and new challenges of science and population health.",

Public health should increase advocacy efforts in health promotion to extend vaccine development and to assure public support for measles control and eradication, as well as other vaccine-preventable diseases. 5. Resources for science advancement and for service delivery are equally important and must be accepted as a governmental responsibility in LMICs as well as in high-income countries. 6. Training of public health and community health workers is vital to meet old and new vaccine challenges of premature death, disease, and disability in aging populations, with severe climate and social inequality challenges. 7. Governments, academic research centers, vaccine manufacturers, and public health authorities require well-designed plans to respond to pandemic illnesses, especially in recognizing the global importance and urgency of the need for quicker development and distribution of the influenza vaccine, as well as for newly emerging infectious disease such as Ebola and Zika, among others.",
