[2] [3] [4] Individuals with potential exposure to SARS cases, but who do not develop the clinical syndrome, generally do not show evidence of seroconversion. 5 Direct evidence of causation is provided by the observation that experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV results in a similar clinical and histologic respiratory disease to that observed in humans. 6 The causative link between the SARS-CoV and SARS has therefore been well established; however, the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which this syndrome occurs are less clear.",

            "text": "Clinical observation and histologic studies confirm that the pathologic effects of infection are largely, but not exclusively, confined to the respiratory tract. Bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia occur early. 7 In lung tissue, an early phase of hyaline membrane formation, edema, and pneumocyte proliferation is followed by diffuse alveolar damage characterized by an exudative and proliferative phase. 7, 8 Although these features appear similar to findings in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characteristics such as predominant macrophage proliferation in consolidated areas and the presence of multinucleate giant cells are more specific for SARS and may suggest an important role for proinflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of SARS. 7 Some data suggest that the viral load in the respiratory secretions of patients with SARS is characterized by a peak occurring around the 10th day of illness followed by a decrease in viral load, concomitant with the appearance of an antibody response to the virus. 9 However, in most patients, clinical deterioration occurs progressively during the second week of illness despite a stable or decreasing viral load. This time course supports the suggestion that part of the lung damage may be immunopathologic. 8, 9 Serum cytokine levels in patients with SARS have been measured. Observational data suggest that proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-16 are increased and peak during the 8th to 14th day following illness onset. 10 Diarrhea is the most commonly reported sign of gastrointestinal involvement reported in patients with SARS. 11 Viral particles have been detected in splenic tissue and the gastrointestinal tract 12 ; however, no cytolytic damage or inflammatory change has been histologically demonstrated in the small or large bowel. Although subclinical myocardial diastolic dysfunction in patients with SARS has been described, histologic examination of cardiac muscle did not reveal any evidence of endocarditis, interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate, or myocardial cell necrosis. 13 The cause of the dysfunction may be related to the effects of mechanical ventilation or circulating cytokines.",

The common presenting features (see later), many of which are similar to other viral infections, may be the consequence of viral replication, proinflammatory mediator production, or other as yet undiscovered mechanisms. The severe and largely isolated respiratory system manifestations typical of SARS are associated with evidence of both viral replication and proinflammatory mediator release, but exact pathophysiologic mechanisms are unknown. As has now been demonstrated in other infective conditions, it is also possible that genetic predisposition may play a role in determining the progression and ultimate severity of illness in individuals, but no published data as yet support this hypothesis.",

            "text": "Patients usually present with fever, chills, rigors, myalgia, and headache. A nonproductive cough is present in only approximately 50% of patients on presentation. Sore throat and rhinorrhea are infrequent ( Fig. 7.1 ). 8 Common laboratory features include an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, lymphopenia, hypocalcemia, and moderate thrombocytopenia. 8, 14 The respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV typically has an insidious onset. Although fever and other systemic symptoms may improve during the first week, particularly if anti-inflammatory therapy is used, the more important markers of clinical deterioration are progressive hypoxia and dyspnea, accompanied by the progression of pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph ( Fig. 7. 2). 8 Respiratory symptoms worsen slowly but steadily and reach a peak in the most severe cases during the first 10 to 15 days. 15 Published data consistently show that the time from symptom onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission in these severe cases was approximately 8 to 10 days. [16] [17] [18] During the outbreak, approximately 20% to 30% of all patients with SARS required ICU admission. 8, 9, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] Admission to the ICU is almost always the consequence of progressive, severe respiratory failure. Current series reported an inability to maintain arterial oxygen saturation greater than 90% to 92% despite administration of supplemental oxygen at concentrations of more than 50% to 60% as criteria for admission to ICU for monitoring. In the currently reported ICU series, more than 90% of patients met the clinical criteria of ARDS following admission (acute onset of bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fractional inspired oxygen concentration (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) of less than 200 mm Hg, and the absence of left atrial hypertension 20 ). [16] [17] [18] Median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores were reported to range between 11 and 19.5, and most patients had isolated respiratory failure on admission. [16] [17] [18] DIAGNOSIS During the early outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria, comprising clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory features for the diagnosis of SARS, were successfully used. 21 Briefly, these criteria were as follows. Patients demonstrating the clinical features of a temperature higher than 38\u00b0C and one or more clinical findings of respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or hypoxia), as well as the epidemiologic features of travel within 10 days of onset of symptoms to an area with current suspected community transmission of SARS, or close contact within 10 days of onset of symptoms with a person known or suspected to have SARS, were considered suspect cases. Probable cases were defined as those having the foregoing features, as well as evidence of pneumonia on a chest radiograph or computed tomography scan. Because of the variable performance of laboratory testing for SARS at this time, case classification did not rely on laboratory criteria. Currently, in the absence of an outbreak and endemic areas, epidemiologic criteria are of very limited use in assisting diagnosis. Only specific epidemiologic criteria, such as a history of laboratory exposure to the SARS virus, remain important. The current laboratory diagnostic criteria from the CDC are therefore important and stringent. They require the detection of antibody to SARS-CoV in a serum sample, or the detection of SARS-CoV RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in two samples, or the isolation of SARS-CoV with confirmation by a PCR assay or the isolation of SARS-CoV. 22 Findings must be verified in an appropriate WHO-certified laboratory. The use of RT-PCR is problematic, however, because interpretation requires some understanding of test parameters. Peiris and colleagues found that the sensitivity of RT-PCR assay is highly dependent on the type of specimen tested and the time of collection of specimens with respect to the day of onset of symptoms. 9 In particular, the viral load as detected by RT-PCR seems to follow a triphasic pattern with a peak on day 10. Sensitivity for respiratory specimens collected at presentation is low (32%), but it increases to approximately 70% during the second week. Yam and associates found that the sensitivities of RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal specimens and throat swabs collected between day 1 and day 5 after admission were 61% to 68% and 65% to 72%, respectively. 23 However, repeated testing on respiratory specimens increases sensitivity to 75% to 79%. The sensitivities on urine and fecal specimens collected between day 5 and day 10 after admission are lower (50% to 60%). The optimal strategy in using RT-PCR assay remains to be defined.",

[16] [17] [18] In our unit, the experience with prone ventilation was one of extreme interpatient variability in response (determined by improved oxygenation in the prone position). The use of nitric oxide in ARDS has not been shown to improve outcome, and anecdotally, the experience in Toronto and Singapore also demonstrates little benefit from nitric oxide in patients with SARS. 16, 17 Few data on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in SARS have yet been reported, but it is our opinion that this mode of ventilation be avoided because of the risk of infected aerosol generation from inevitable mask leakage and high gas-flow compensation. 18, 43 An unexpectedly high incidence of barotrauma-related air leak has been reported in patients with SARS. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema, alone or in combination, occurred in 20% and 30% of patients admitted to ICU. [16] [17] [18] This incidence is high compared with rates previously reported in ARDS. 39, 44 The risk does not seem to be associated with the use of excessive tidal volume or airway pressure, 16, 18 and it is not limited to patients receiving mechanical ventilation. 18 The exact mechanisms for this observation are unclear, but computed tomography studies in patients with SARS have shown that the diffuse alveolar damage observed in SARS progresses to fibrosis and the formation of cysts, 45 and rupture of these cysts during or after formation could contribute to extraparenchymal gas leaks.",

For patients with SARS who were admitted to the ICU, the 28-day mortality was 34% in Toronto, 37% in Singapore, and 26% in Hong Kong (with a median APACHE II score of 19.5, 18, and 11, respectively). [16] [17] [18] Longer follow-up showed a slightly higher mortality. 17 Patients who died were more often older, had higher APACHE II scores, had greater comorbidities, and were more likely to have had bilateral radiologic infiltrates on hospital admission. 16, 18 Long-term complications for ICU survivors include residual pulmonary abnormalities, muscle weakness, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and other long-term complications of corticosteroid treatment, such as osteonecrosis. 15 In a six-month follow up study of a cohort of SARS patients, exercise capacity and health status of SARS survivors was considerably lower than that of a normal population at 6 months. 48 Most pulmonary function test parameters were minimally impaired, although significant impairment in surface area for gas exchange was noted in 15.5% of survivors. The functional disability appeared disproportionate to the degree of lung function impairment and may have been related to additional factors such as muscle deconditioning and steroid myopathy. Lung function tests at 6 months showed moderate, but significantly lower forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), and carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO) in survivors who had required ICU support than in those who were treated on general wards, although no significant differences were noted in 6MWD and respiratory muscle strength. 48 A striking feature during the epidemic was its high rate of nosocomial transmission of SARS, particularly to health care workers. 1 In addition to the risk from direct patient exposure, many procedures in the ICU, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, or the use of nebulizers and Venturi-type oxygen masks, pose an additional risk of transmission of SARS-CoV to the health care worker. Because the disease has the ability to produce significant morbidity and to incapacitate staff for long periods, staff protection is critical to ensure the continued provision of adequate ICU services. The CDC issued guidelines and recommendations on infection control in health care facilities. 49 It is considered prudent by some clinicians to adopt contact and airborne infection isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions. 50, 51 Patient isolation in rooms with appropriate air-change performance, 52 as well as the appropriate and strictly enforced use of gloves and gowns, particulate, respirators and eye protection, is required. [49] [50] [51] 53 Ventilator circuits should be isolated from the environment by the use of filters, scavenging, and closedsuction systems, for example. Environmental cleansing with appropriate solutions such as chloride and hypochlorite is an important component of infection control. Staff members should be fully informed regarding relevant advances in knowledge of SARS and properly educated on infection control precautions. 53 Psychological support should be offered to the staff.",
