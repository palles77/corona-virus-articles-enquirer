The expressed polypeptide is glycosylated and is recognized by a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for JHMV S protein. Three of these mAbs have a very high neutralizing activity for JHMV but not for other MHV strains. These results indicate that JHMV-specific, major neutralizing epitopes reside in the ammo terminal Sl subunit of the peplomer glycoprotein.",

As is evident in Fig. 2 (lane, AcS, TM-), the S protein is not cleaved in insect cells. Additionally, we have confirmed the expression of an immunoreactive S protein and SA polypeptide in insect cells by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3) and shown that the polypeptides are located on the cell surface (data not shown; Yoden et al., 1989) . The molecular weight of the SA polypeptide synthesized in infected Sf cells suggests that carbohydrate side chains had been attached to the majority of the potential N-glycosylation sites. To confirm this conclusion the pulse-labeling experiments were repeated in the presence of tunicamycin at a concentration of 10 pg/ml. As shown in Fig. 2 (lane AcSA, TM+) th e apparent mol. wt. of the SA polypeptide expressed in the presence of tunicamycin was reduced to approximately 70,000. This result is in agreement with the size predicted for the non-glycosylated SA polypeptide from the cDNA sequence and also indicates that the polyclonal anti-JHMV serum contains components which recognized the non-glycosylated S polypeptide.",

As is shown in Table 1 , all of mAbs except 32-4 and 141-3 have been shown to be JHMV specific, since they did not react with the other MHV strains so far examined. Three of four mAbs tested, 110-3, 75-4 and 8-1, had very high neutralizing activity (1: > 200,000) and one mAb, 32-4, had low neutralizing activity (1 : 100) as judged by the 50% plaque reduction method (Taguchi et al., 1980) . Three of the mAbs, 141-3, 104-2, and 29-6 were not able to neutralize virus infectivity. With the exception of mAb 29-6, all of the mAbs tested were shown by immunofluorescence to bind to the SA polypeptide expressed in recombinant baculovirus infected Sf cells (Table 1 and Fig. 3) . These results clearly show that there are epitopes in the Sl polypeptide of the JHMV surface protein which are able to elicit the high neutralizing antibodies (major neutralizing epitopes) as well as epitopes for low-and non-neutralizing antibodies. At the present time we are not able to say why the mAb 29-6 failed to bind to the S protein synthesized in the baculovirus system. This might result, for example, from differences in the glycosylation of the S polypeptide in insect and mammalian cells.",

            "text": "Recently, it has been reported that both the Sl and S2 subunits of the MHV-A59 S protein contain epitopes which bind neutralizing mAbs (Weismiller et al., 1990) . This conclusion was based upon the binding specificities for a large set of S protein specific mAbs derived from immunizations with JHMV DL strain (Fleming et al., 1983) and MHV-A59 (Collins et al., 1982) . However, it was conspicuous in this study that the strongly neutralizing, JHMV (DL) specific mAbs (5.1.2, 5.2.2, 5.7.2) did not react with MHV-A59, which could be due to the big antigenic difference between JHMV and A59 (Taguchi et al., 1982) and that the strongly neutralizing, MHV-A59 specific mAb (4B11.6) could not be assigned unequivocally to either the Sl or S2 subunit. Thus the binding specificities of the strongly neutralizing mAbs have not yet been determined. There is no doubt that neutralizing epitopes exist in both Sl and S2 subunits (Luytjes et al., 1989 , Weismiller et al., 1990 ; however, we believe that our data are the first to show that MHV S protein epitopes which elicit strongly neutralizing antibodies are located in the Sl subunit. This conclusion is in agreement with similar studies on the avian infectious bronchitis virus (Cavanagh et al., 1986) and the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Delmas et al., 1990) .",

Originally, it was proposed, on the basis of Tl fingerprint analysis, that the crossover site of recombination in these isolates was located in the S2 subunit locus. However, recent sequence data (Banner et al., 1990) indicate that, in fact, recombination occurred in the Sl subunit locus. It therefore remains unclear whether the epitopes which bind 5.2.2 and 5.7.2 are located in the Sl or S2 subunits. It has recently been shown (Taguchi and Fleming, 1989 ) that these two mAbs do not react with the JHMV variants, sp-4 and JHM-X, which have been shown to contain genomic deletions in the Sl subunit region (Schmidt et al., 1987 , Banner et al., 1990 . It seems very likely, but not yet proven, that the epitopes for these mAbs reside in the region of the Sl subunit encompassed by these deletions.",

The coronavirus S gene cDNA sequence is shown witbin brackets. The predicted amino acid sequence of the SA polypeptide ca.rb~xyterminus is also shown. Amino acids which are not enwded by coronavirus cDNA are underlined, as is the putative MHV S protein cleavage site. Expression of the S and SA polypeptides by recombinant baculovirus in insect cells. The polypeptides synthesized in Sf cells infected with the recombinant baculoviruses, AcS and AcSA, were. labelled for 1 h with 3H-leucine (20 pCi/rnl, 140.5 Ci/mmol) at 24 h post-infection. Cell lysates were precipitated with anti-JHMV antibodies and analysed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sf cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses were untreated (TM-) or treated with 10 ag/ml of tunicamycin (TM + ).",
