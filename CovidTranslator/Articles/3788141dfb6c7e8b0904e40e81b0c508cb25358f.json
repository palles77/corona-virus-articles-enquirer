Clinicians believed that this decline was a genuine decline in cases as opposed to less attention to case detection than in previous weeks. For the outer island of Onoun, the first suspected case fell ill on approximately 19 September, and the weekly number of cases peaked on 14 October and 4 November. This second peak was at the time of the investigation; case numbers declined the following week.

Geographic remoteness, as was the case in the outer islands of Chuuk, can lead to delays in taking blood samples; these may often be taken after the viraemic period, and tests aiming to find pathogens (culture, antigen or PCR tests) may thus be falsely negative.

In any outbreak, health professionals should undertake prompt descriptive epidemiological analyses to help ascertain the cause of the outbreak. A line list using all available sources of information is a valuable tool in outbreak investigation, and analysis of the symptomatic presentation can greatly assist in finding the cause(s) of the outbreak. Laboratory systems to collect, ship where required and analyse specimens need to be prompt, well rehearsed and resourced to aid outbreak investigation. patient consultation early in the course of the illness can help ensure the pathogen is still possible to detect in the clinical specimen. 11 Despite the outbreak being almost over by the time of the investigation, there were several benefits to undertaking it. These include: identifying strengths and weaknesses of the surveillance and response system; making recommendations to prevent and contain future outbreaks; understanding disease patterns in the state, country and region for informing policy and practice; building capacity among the investigation teams; and demonstrating to the public that the outbreak is being taken seriously. 10 With increasing domestic and international travel, respiratory disease outbreaks such as influenza can spread rapidly. 12 Since the SARS epidemic, researchers have found that air transportation is responsible for the global pattern of emerging diseases 13 and that every person is potentially no more than 24 hours away from being affected by any epidemic happening somewhere in the world. Outbreak surveillance and response is an essential process to limit the spread and impact of outbreaks. Global and regional partners need to continue to invest in building the capacity of low-and middleincome countries in the surveillance and response of outbreak-prone diseases.",
