They include astroviruses,89 caliciviruses,89 parvoviruses,76 Breda virus,92 and a virus that causes villous epithelial syncytia. 48 A number of other unclassified virions have also been observed by electron microscopy in diarrheic fecal samples. 19, 21 Characteristics of the Calf Rotavirus Rotaviruses are classified as a genus of the Reoviridae family of RNAcontaining viruses having the unique characteristic of containing doublestranded (ds) RNA. 23, 41, 93 Morphologically, all rotaviruses are identical, having a distinct appearance when examined by electron microscopy under negative staining (Fig. 1) . Particles are round, 65 to 75 nm in diameter, and have a hexagonal core from which the capsomers radiate, giving them a \"wheel-like\" appearance. Rotaviruses contain a double layer of capsomers. Complete rotavirus particles have a buoyant density of 1.36 gm per cm 3 and present a smooth outline when examined by negative-staining electron microscopy; incomplete particles, however, which lack the outer layer of capsomers, have a density of 1.38 gm per cm 3 and a rough outline. Calf rotavirus is resistant to pH 3.0 and ether and is relatively stable to heat. 29 ,41,93 Some calf-rotavirus isolates have the ability to hemagglutinate human erythrocytes. 73 Calf rotavirus has survived. up to 9 months in fecal material stored at room temperature,88 or 1 hour at 6\u00b0C. 41 Rotaviruses can survive several days in distilled water as well as in wastewater3 9 -characteristics that have important implications in the epidemiology of rotavirus infection.",

This technique of electropherotyping has been used in recent years to study the epidemiology of rotaviruses in large populations and to help in the distinction of rotaviruses from different animal species. 33 It has been estimated that rotaviruses have 8 to 10 polypeptides that have a molecular weight ranging from 15 to 130 X 10 3 daltons. 41 , 93 The polypeptides contained in the internal layer of capsomers have the groupantigenic determinants, whereas those present in the outer surface of the virion are thought to have the species-specific antigens. 8 In the last few years, viruses morphogically undistinguishable from rotaviruses have been isolated from several animal species from cases of neonatal diarrheas. 72 These rotaviruses are atypical in that they lack the common antigen; thus, they are serologically different. These atypical rotaviruses, also known as pararotaviruses or rotavirus-like viruses, are pathogenic for susceptible animals. 72 The incidence of diarrheas in calves due to atypical rotaviruses has been estimated in less than 1 per cent of all rotaviral diarrheas.72 This group of atypical rotaviruses (designated as group B rotaviruses) may turn out to be a separate genus of the Reoviridae family as more information on their characteristics becomes available.",

SerologiC surveys indicate that rotavirus infection in cattle could be as high as 90 to 100 per cent,69 with morbidity rates for clinical rotaviral diarrhea in the order of 20 to 40 per cent,31 and with occasional outbreaks approaching 100 per cent. 55 Mortality in uncomplicated rotavirus diarrhea in neonatal calves is less than 10 per cent, but it increases in cases of secondary infection with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli or with other enteric viruses. 31 ,55 Most cases of calf rotaviral diarrhea are found in calves under 10 days of age. In some instances, however, rotaviral diarrhea has been diagnosed in calves 3 to 4 months of age, as well as in some adult animals. 88 ,90 A recent report on a longitudinal survey of rotavirus infection in a closed dairy herd indicates that rotaviruses were present in 79 per cent of the fecal samples collected during two consecutive calving seasons. Of these rotavirus-infected animals, only 58 per cent developed diarrhea, leaving a 42 per cent incidence of subclinical rotavirus infection.43 These data are similar to that found in children with rotavirus infections. 33",

The calf coronavirus is serologically related to other coronaviruses, including mouse hepatitis virus type 3 and human coronavirus strain OC 43, and to the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine. However, it is not serologically related to the human coronavirus strain 229E, canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, or feline infectious peritonitis virus. 24,61,67 Antibodies to calf coronavirus have been found in a variety of animal species, including humans. 68 Some isolates of calf coronaviruses can be experimentally pathogenic for mice producing encephalitis. 35 Coronaviruses associated with neonatal calf diarrhea have worldwide distribution. 10 The prevalence of antibodies to the calf coronavirus is high in the cattle population, closer to 100 per cent. 65 Morbidity of coronavirus enteritis has been estimated at 15 to 25 per cent,36 with mortality rates of 5 to 10 per cent in uncomplicated coronavirus infections. Mortality rates are significantly higher in cases of secondary viral or bacterial infections, especially those of enteropathogenic E. coli. 31 Most cases of coronavirus diarrhea are observed in calves 5 to 20 days of age,11,36,49 but epizootics of coronaviral diarrhea have been reported in adult cattle. 79 There is evidence that strains of calf coronavirus can infect the bovine respiratory tract. 63 ",

The course of natural rotavirus infections in the field is chararacterized by a sudden onset of diarrhea that spreads very rapidly among neonatal calves present on the farm. The incubation period has been estimated to be 12 to 36 hours under experimental conditions. The incubation period in field cases may be somewhat longer (24 to 48 hours) depending on the dose of the virus challenge. Typically, the signs of rotavirus infection include reluctance to stand and nurse, mild depression, salivation, and watery, yellow diarrhea. Diarrhea may last for 1 to 2 days in uncomplicated cases, and much longer (3 to 5 days) in cases with secondary bacterial infections. Under germ-free conditions, the rotaviral diarrhea is self-limiting and of short (6 to 10 hours) duration, with full recovery by 24 hours after infection. Recovery from natural outbreaks of rotaviral diarrhea depends upon the degree of secondary intestinal infection and dehydration. Mortality can be high if there is a concomitant infection with enterotoxigenic E. coli strains. There are no gross lesions in calves with rotaviral diarrhea, except for the presence of liquid intestinal contents throughout the intestinal tract.",

Rotavirus infection can have a broad spectrum of clinical effects, ranging from severe illness with high mortality to infection with no clinical abnormality at all. Serotype of virus and the effect of colostral antibody are important factors. Recent reports from the United Kingdom and Japan 57 ,59 have demonstrated that there are distinct serotypes of rotavirus based on neutralization reactions.

It seems that proteolytic enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract of calves probably play an important role in the pathogenesis of rotavirus infections, but the mechanisms through which they exert their effects have yet to be elucidated. The infectivity of rotaviruses has been greatly enhanced in in-vitro experiments by reaction with certain proteolytic enzymes. 2 ,4 The addition of trypsin to cell-culture systems has been reported to enhance bovine rotavirus production by 1000 times. 2 Activation of rotavirus in vitro by intestinal trypsin has been postulated to occur in rotavirus infections in children 40 and in domestic animals. 80 Proteolytic enzymes fed to piglets infected with human rotavirus have been shown to exacerbate diarrhea. 75 The primary target cells for rotavirus infection are the epithelial cells lining the small intestine (enterocytes). Epithelial cells covering the villous surface of the upper small intestine are the first to become infected (Fig.  3 ).

However, clinical manifestations are more severe in cases of coronavirus diarrhea. Initially, there is a sudden onset of diarrhea in susceptible calves after an incubation period of 36 to 60 hours. Typical signs include moderate depression, reluctance to nurse, and the passage offeces containing mucus and milk curds. After 2 to 4 days of diarrhea, calves can become severly depressed, weak, and gaunt; death follows in severe cases. As in rotavirus infections, postmortem examination reveals no gross lesions, and the intestines have moderate distention with liquid contents. Under germfree conditions, the coronavirus diarrhea is significantly more severe than rotavirus diarrhea and can lead to death, even in the absence of secondary enteric infections.",

Transmission electron microscopy has been a method utilized for the discovery of enteric viruses and continues to be a diagnostic procedure of choice for several reasons. 21 Electron microscopy can detect a number of different virus particles in the same fecal preparation, thus providing a broad, but nonspecific, diagnostic tool for a variety of serologically different viruses, most of which cannot be propagated in cell cultures. 19 Electron microscopy procedures are also rapid and comparatively inexpensive for diagnostic laboratories having access to an electron microscope. Some of the disadvantages of the electron microscopy procedure are its rather low sensitivity (estimated at 1 X 10 6 virions per ml of feces) and the need to have personnel trained in the operation of the electron microscope and in the interpretation of the images. 21 A rapid electron microscopy procedure for detection of fecal viruses under\" negative staining\" that has been used successfully for many years by one of us (A. T -M.), is as follows: A 15 to 20 per cent suspension of feces is prepared in buffered saline and agitated vigorously in a vortex mixer. This suspension is then centrifuged at low speed (less than 400 X g) for 20 to 30 minutes, and the supernatant is saved. This is an important step, because many enteric viruses are found to be present in large aggregates that could be pelle ted and discarded at higher centrifugal forces. 58 The low-speed supernatant is then transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 minutes. The supernatant is decanted, the resulting pellet is saved and reconstituted in 0.5 ml of distilled water. This concentrated specimen is now ready to be sprayed onto collodion-and carbon- One can enhance electron microscopic detection of enteric viruses by using specific antibodies mixed with the clarified fecal preparation before ultracentrifugation; this procedure is known as immunoelectron microscopy. This procedure may be useful in viewing small virions but is not practical for routine diagnosis, because virions with different antigenic composition will not be clumped by the antibody preparation.",

The ability to purify large amounts of rotavirus from diarrheic fecal samples and the presence of a common antigen for rotaviruses from different animal species led to the development of rapid and sensitive methods for the detection of rotavirus antigens in fecal samples. Both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and radioimmunoassays (RIA) have been used for rotavirus-antigen detection with excellent results. 4 ,17 Initially, ELISA and RIA procedures were mostly used in research, but in recent years, commercially available ELISA tests have opened the opportunity of rotavirus diagnosis to most clinical or diagnostic laboratories. The use of RIA tests continues to be mostly of research use owing to its instrumentation and restrictions in the use of radioactive materials. Most of the commercially available ELISA tests have been developed for humans, but they work equally well for animal rotaviruses that share the common antigen. ELISA tests are more sensitive than electron microscopy procedures and are rapid and accurate. 7 ,18 Their dis-*Ted Pella Company, Tustin, California. advantage is that they are very specific for rotaviruses and will not detect the newly recognized atypical rotaviruses nor other enteric viruses that may be present in diarrheic fecal samples. If there is interest in detecting only rotavirues, ELISA tests are more than adequate, but if a comprehensive etiologic diagnosis of neonatal calf diarrhea is to be established, then electron microscopy procedures are recommended because of their broad specificity, even though they may be slightly less sensitive. The same applies to RIA tests, In the case of calf coronavirus, both ELISA and RIA tests have been developed,65 but they are still limited to use in research environments. No such tests are commercially available at the present time.",

            "text": "Immunostaining. Rotavirus and coronavirus antigens can be detected in intestinal samples from infected calves by immunofluorescent (fluorescent antibody) staining of frozen sections or of fecal smears. Fluorescent antibody procedures were very useful in the early work with both calf rotavirus and calf coronavirus. In the case of rotavirus, smears of fecal samples, as well as frozen sections from segments of mid to caudal small intestine, are good samples for fluorescent antibody staining. For intestinal samples, this is a limiting factor, unless euthanasia and postmortem examination are performed in the acutely ill calf. The reason for this requirement is that the number of rotavirus-infected enterocytes attached to the intestinal villi and present in the intestinal lumen decreases very rapidly after the onset of diarrhea. 46 The number of enterocytes containing rotavirus antigen that are present in the feces or in the intestinal mucosa is very low 18 to 24 hours after the onset of diarrhea. In the case of calf coronavirus, fluorescent antibody staining of mid to caudal frozen sections of small intestine has the same limitations as for cases of rotavirus infections. However, examination of fecal smears for detection of cells containing coronavirus antigen by fluorescent antibody procedures is a futile enterprise due to the cytolytic action of coronavirus for infected enterocytes. 47 Fluorescent antibody staining may be applied in a case of coronavirus on frozen segments of colon, because of the fact that coronavirus infects the colonic mucosa of calves and coronavirus antigen persists in the crypt cells for 3 to 4 days after the onset of diarrhea. 47 Still there is a limitation of obtaining colon samples from either dead or euthanatized calves. Reagents for fluorescent antibody staining of intestinal samples for calf rotavirus and coronavirus are available in most state diagnostic laboratories as a service provided by the National Veterinary Service Laboratory of the V.S. Department of Agriculture. Other laboratories in the V nited States and especially abroad have limitations in procurement of fluorescein-conjugated antibodies for these tests.",

CIE is fast and relatively sensitive, although less so than ELISA or electron microscopy procedures. Their limitation is their specificity and, thus, their inability to detect rotavirus or coronaviruses of different antigenic composition or other unrelated viruses associated with neonatal calf diarrheas. SUMMARY A number of different viruses can be primary pathogens in the neonatal calf diarrhea complex. By far the most common viruses causing calfhood diarrhea found throughout the world are rotaviruses and coronaviruses. Primary infection of newborn calves with either one of these viruses can cause severe intestinal alterations and diarrhea.",

Res., 45(4):643-651, 1984; with permission.) a very short period infected cells are desquamated into the intestinal lumen. Exfoliated cells containing viral antigen are found in the feces. Identification of infected cells present in the feces by immunofluorescent microscopy was the original method used to diagnose calf rotavirus infection. Following the exfoliation of infected cells, the villi become atrophied (Fig. 6), covered by immature cells with a squamous to cuboidal morphology (Fig. 7) that migrate up from the unaffected crypts. The replacement of infected cells by immature cells begins within 4 hours after the onset of diarrhea. 44 The immature cells are refractory to virus infection and are functionally unprepared for the digestive and absorptive roles of the normal villous epithelium; this results in continued diarrhea. Crypt epithelial cells are not involved. Although desquamation of the epithelium of the abomasum and large intestine has been reported,16 for all practical purposes, rotavirus infection is limited to the small intestine. Examination of intestinal tissues collected from infected calves reveal rotavirus replication within the cistern of the endoplasmic reticulum of mature villous epithelial cells and macrophages of the lamina propria of the small intestine. Free virus particles are present in the luminal contents approximately 30 hours after infection. The number of virions increases very rapidly, and quantities up to 10 X 10 9 per gm of feces are not unusual. Light microscopic photomicrograph of mid-ileum from a normal 48-hour-old calf.

The sprayed grids are then air dried and examined under a transmission electron microscope at a screen magnification of 45, 000. Observation should concentrate on the edges of the small droplets formed on the grids, becaue virions tend to concentrate in these areas owing to surface tension. At least five grid squares containing at least one droplet should be examined.
