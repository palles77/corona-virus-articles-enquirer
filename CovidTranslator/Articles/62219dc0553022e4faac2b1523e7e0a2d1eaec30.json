            "text": "Liver cirrhosis is the end-stage of chronic liver disease, and with the progress of liver cirrhosis, hepatocyte necrosis is presented widely, as well as fibrosis, which destroys the normal structure of the liver. [1] Liver cirrhosis ranks as the 14th leading cause of mortality in adults in the world and in Korea, liver diseases rank as the 8th leading cause of mortality, accounting for 13.3 deaths per 100,000. [2, 3] The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates of patients with cirrhosis are 68%, 57%, and 43%, respectively. Liver cirrhosis is one of the major diseases leading to mortality in Korea in which the incidence rate of hepatitis B is high. [4] There are a variety of causes, including chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, consumption of a large amount of alcohol, and autoimmunity, while hepatitis B is the most common, with 48% to 70% of cases. [5] Depending on the presence of complications in the progress of liver cirrhosis, it is classified into decompensated cirrhosis, with complications, and compensated cirrhosis, without complications. [6] The progress rate of compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis is approximately 58% and once it progresses to decompensated cirrhosis, its mortality rate within 5 years becomes 85% without liver transplantation. [7] Complications could cause a high difference in the progress of the disease. Most common complications are ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and varicose veins. [8] Since the progression of cirrhosis is accelerated each time a complication recurs, the management and treatment of the complication is critical in enhancing the quality of life and the life expectancy of patients. [7] With the recent diversification of chronic diseases, the incidence rate of complications has also risen; so, the management of complications has a higher influence over the quality of life. [7] [8] [9] Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that in patients with liver cirrhosis, the presence of complications and its treatment are critical factors for anticipating the degradation of the quality of life and the mortality.",

            "text": "Liver transplantation enhances the quality of life and survival rate of patients with cirrhosis; however, numerous patients are not given the opportunity of liver transplantation due to a lack of donors. As an indicator for the progress and prognosis of cirrhosis, the model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium (MELD-Na) has been recommended. [10, 11] Traditionally, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) is used as index for assessing the progress of cirrhosis of an inpatient, and the severity of cirrhosis is classified into A, B, and C based on the presence of ascites and/or hepatic encephalopathy, serum bilirubin, prothrombin period, and serum albumin. [10, 12] Using CTP, 5 to 6 points are assigned to Stage A, 7 to 9 points to Stage B, and 10 points or higher to Stage C. The higher the score is, the more severe it gets. [10] However, since subjective judgement could be involved in the judgement of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, indices of CTP, the judgement of severity using the MELD or the MELD-Na is becoming more important, as well as treatment mediation based on such severity. [11] MELD-Na is assessed with serum bilirubin, prothrombin period, serum creatinine, serum sodium, and other factors. Since MELD-Na is more likely to predict mortality than other tools, it has been recently used to create a waiting list of patients for liver transplantation. [12, 13] Studies on the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis have been mostly focused on terminal cases and anticipation of short-term mortality, and most of them highlight the analysis of prognosis of patients with cirrhosis rather than classification of patients considering the level of severity. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Moreover, the analysis of prognostic factors for mortality of patients should include not only disease-related factors, but also personal and social factors. Such analysis could provide a comprehensive and systematic understanding of patients diagnosed with cirrhotic complications. Therefore, in this study, patients diagnosed with cirrhotic complications were divided into a high-risk group and a low-risk group using MELD-Na designed with objective physiological indicators, and prognostic factors were analyzed for each group. We aimed to devise a self-nursing method suitable for each severity level of liver cirrhosis and to provide basic data for improving the effectiveness of management of chronic diseases.",

It would be attributable to its significantly longer follow-up period, of 14 years, than other studies of which follow-up periods were up to 20 months, and the relatively lower AUC of this study might be because it included data from even cases censored during the follow-up period in order to reduce bias in its results.

Compared with previous studies, this study addressed patients with relatively low mortality rates, less severe conditions, and longer average survival period, but it would be necessary to expand the scope of participants to raise the use of the cut-off point of MELD-Na.",

CTP point and stage are very important factors for predicting mortality, and other studies have supported. [12, 27] Among various significant prognostic factors of patients with cirrhosis, CTP score was claimed to be the most significant variable. [1] Therefore, despite the criticism that the CTP point is a subjective tool, it is still a very important index to determine the prognosis of cirrhosis.

[30, 31] In addition to CTP or modified Chile-Pugh classification, indocyanine green (ICG) test, MELD, MELD-Na, and MELD to Serum Sodium ratio (MESO) have been examined as mortality predictors, but their accuracies vary between patients, depending on the presence of complications and/or variables.

Since there is no study on the relationship between mortality prognosis and primary caregivers for patients with cirrhosis, it is not possible to have a direct comparison, but in the study on self-management of disease by the recipient of liver transplantation, family relationship was found to be a factor affecting self-management of disease, and family supports and cohabitation were shown to be important variables for self-management of disease for patients with chronic diseases. [33, 34] Therefore, family support could affect the self-management of disease as well as progression and prognosis of disease. Since a patient's spouse constantly seeks out what the patient needs, communicates, and exchanges emotions with the patient, the presence of a spouse could affect disease selfmanagement of a patient. [33] The results of this study also support the importance of a spouse's support and suggest the importance of participation of a spouse in the treatment of a patient.",

[1, 35] However, as shown in the systematic review by D'Amico et al, [1] since there are only few studies addressing AST, it would be necessary to consider more various laboratory results. Laboratory results are not significant as a mortality predictor in the high-risk group because they are included in the classification criterion or they include abnormal results since patients are at high risk for mortality. On the other hand, in case of the low-risk group, laboratory results are likely to indicate normal conditions so the change in such laboratory results could have a significant influence over the mortality risk rate. Therefore, for patients with early stage cirrhosis, laboratory results are very important and it is also important for them to understand that it is critical to monitor and correct the laboratory results for the treatment of disease.",

[27] The fact that important risk factors differ among risk groups has a clinically important meaning. The classification of patients by risk level could be the foundation to provide accurate guidelines for disease management. Furthermore, this classification could be the foundation for patients with cirrhosis, for which early detection of mortality prognosis and timely management of complications are critical to correct such prognostic factors and apply a proper nursing intervention. This study is significant given that it applied MELD-Na to patients diagnosed with cirrhosis complications for the first time, examined its cut-off point to classify patients based on the risk of disease, and investigated the risk factors for each risk group. Furthermore, it examined prognostic factors from a population-social perspective, other than the medical perspective.",

Since this study analyzed mortality prognostic factors through the analysis of survival of patients with cirrhosis, it would be possible to have a variety of studies on factors of survival and mortality of patients from the perspective of nursing through the analysis of survival of various diseases. Especially, based on the results of this study, when nursing patients are diagnosed with complications of cirrhosis for the first time, early detection of mortality prognostic factors would be possible. Such early detection could allow for the correction of factors that might promote mortality, as well as prevention of recurrence of the complications and provision of nursing interventions to help the progress of disease in patients.",
