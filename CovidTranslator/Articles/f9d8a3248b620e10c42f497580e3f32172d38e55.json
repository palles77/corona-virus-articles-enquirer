This cross-sectional study sought to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and associated coping styles within the general population visiting community health care services. Methods: It was conducted on individuals attending community polyclinics in Singapore within the first week of July 2003, 16 weeks after the first national outbreak of SARS. The General Health Questionnaire-28, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brief COPE were used to determine the prevalence rates of psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and employed coping strategies respectively. Results: The overall response rate was 78.0%. Of the 415 community health care setting respondents, we found significant rates of SARS-related psychiatric (22.9%) and posttraumatic morbidities (25.8%). The presence of psychiatric morbidity was associated with the presence of high level of posttraumatic symptoms [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-4.13, P=.008]. Psychiatric morbidity was further associated with being seen at fever stations (adjusted OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.08-3.34, P=.026), younger age (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, P=.021), increased self blame (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.22-2.28, P=.001), less substance use (adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98, P=.034) and posttraumatic morbidity was associated with increased use of denial (adjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04-1.67, P=.024), and planning (adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.16-1.95, P=.002) as coping measures. Conclusion: These findings could potentially inform the development of practical community mental health programs for future infectious disease outbreaks.",

            "text": "Recent years in the 21st century have witnessed a number of challenges to social order and community stability in the realm of major infectious disease outbreaks. These infectious diseases outbreaks include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and that which may potentially occur in the future, such as the avian influenza [1, 2] . Psychosocial responses towards such infectious disease outbreaks are variable and can range from feelings of anxiety, a sense of shame, failure or weakness of the individual and society [3] , and an underestimation of likelihood of survival, an overestimation of likelihood of infection [4] to a sudden flight from the outbreak [5] , an excessive and inappropriate adoption of precautionary measures, as well as an increased demand for health care services in a time of shortage [6] . A better understanding of the psychological and coping responses within the noninfected community towards infectious disease outbreaks are important for several reasons. First, high prevalences of psychological morbidities have been documented in individuals exposed directly or vicariously to life threatening situations [7, 8] . Second, such psychological morbidities occurring in a substantial proportion of the community can impact on the daily functioning of these affected individuals with immediate social and economic consequences such as lost job productivity and financial hardship [1] . Third, situation-specific coping strategies may mitigate and moderate the nature and impact of these psychosocial responses [9] [10] [11] . Fourth, better safeguarding of the psychological wellbeing of the community with practical mental health programs is crucial as it would help to prevent or ameliorate any disruption of health care delivery in the community during such outbreaks [12] .",

Data regarding the psychological impact on the larger noninfected community are needed in order to understand the full psychosocial dimension of such disease outbreaks. Hence, using the SARS as an example of a major new emerging infectious disease of the 21st century, we aimed to: (1) determine the prevalence of psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities within the non-infected population visiting community health care services and (2) evaluate the differences in associated factors and coping styles between those with and without these psychological morbidities.",

In Singapore, there is a dual system of health care delivery. The public system is managed by the Government whereas the private system is provided by the private hospitals and general practitioners. The primary health care services are delivered at the public outpatient polyclinics and the private clinics of medical practitioners. The National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP), one of the two public primary health care delivery networks, runs a total of nine polyclinics in the whole island state of Singapore. Each polyclinic serves as a one-stop community health care center that provides comprehensive outpatient medical care, immunization, health screening and education, follow-up of patients discharged from hospitals, investigative facilities, and pharmacy services.",

In late February 2003, this condition was termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which also provided a clinical case definition [17] . This potentially fatal condition was reported to be caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus and is characterised by both an atypical pneumonia and efficient droplet transmission [18] . Locally, the largest outbreak of SARS began in mid March 2003 and was traced to a traveler returning from Hong Kong [19] . In Singapore, a total of 238 individuals were infected with SARS, with an overall third highest case fatality rate of 13.9%: behind Canada (251 infected; 17.1% case fatality rate) and China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (1755 infected; 17.0% case fatality rate) but above Taiwan (346 infected, 10.7% case fatality rate) [20] . At the primary health care level, infection control measures that were rapidly implemented included the use of the personal protective equipment amongst the health care workers attending to patients including those presenting with a febrile illness, regular temperature monitoring, filling of health declaration forms, regular audit of infection control measures, and the setting up of fever stations to isolate and manage individuals with any febrile condition within the polyclinics [21] . The operation of the fever stations at the polyclinics was terminated on August 1, 2003.",

The 28 items can be grouped into 4 subscales: somatic, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression subscales. Suitable for identifying minor psychiatric disorder in community samples, this measure allows \"caseness\" to be determined by means of a total score. Using the conventional GHQ binary scoring method (range 0-28), a total GHQ score of 5 and above is indicative of a case of \"psychiatric morbidity\" [23] . (b) The SARS-related posttraumatic morbidity was determined by the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) [24] , a 22-item scale which measured the extent to which the respondents were distressed by the SARS-related symptoms of intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal as experienced in the past week using a 5point rating scale on a range of 0-4. Two scores were calculated from the IES-R, namely, a continuous score (total and subscales) and a dichotomous category of high versus low level of posttraumatic symptoms [25] . When calculating the dichotomous scores, symptoms were considered present if the respondents reported that they have been at least moderately distressed by the symptoms in the prior week (score of 2 on a scale of 0-4) [26] . Post traumatic morbidity was determined by using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (N1 re-experiencing symptoms, N3 avoidance symptoms, and N2 arousal symptoms) [27] . Subjects fulfilling these cutoffs were classified as having a high level of posttraumatic stress symptoms. (c) Coping was assessed using the Brief COPE questionnaire [28] . It comprises 28 items and can be grouped into14 coping strategies (two items per strategy) used in response to a particular stressor: self distraction, active coping, denial, substance use, emotional support seeking, instrumental support seeking, behavioral disengagement, venting, positive reframing, planning, humor, acceptance, religion, and self-blame. Participants were asked to indicate on a fourpoint scale, ranging from 1 (I haven't been doing this at all) to 4 (I have been doing this a lot), how often they used each strategy to cope with SARS-related stress symptoms.",

            "text": "The rate of psychiatric morbidity (22.9%) in this study was higher compared with our baseline population prevalence rate of 16.6% (using GHQ-28) in our previous National Mental Health Survey [30] . However, the rate was comparable with that (20.6%) found in medical staff working within the same primary health care setting [31] and was consistent with the range of found rates of SARS-related psychiatric morbidity (ranging from 18.8% to 75.3% using GHQ) assessed in health care workers working within the hospitals [32, 33] as well as survivors of SARS [16] . On the other hand, the rate of posttraumatic morbidity (25.8%) was considerably higher than that (9.4%) found in the medical staff from the same community health care setting [31] but seemed consistent with the rate of posttraumatic morbidity found in other studies (ranging from 17.7% to 33.0% using IES) of medical staff working within hospital units and dealing with infectious disease (322 [34] ). Some caveats for the significant rates of psychiatric and post traumatic morbidities could relate to the fact that some of the participants who visited primary health care centers may be self-selected or worried well and who were more predisposed to the development of psychological morbidity either before or after visiting the clinics or an interaction of the above factors. Individuals with psychiatric comorbidity measured higher on the three IES-R subscale scores of intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance and those with a high level of posttraumatic stress measured higher on the four GHQ subscale scores of somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction, indicating the extent of psychological impact involving all areas ascertained using the scales and not limited to certain domains. This is in agreement with previous reports which have also documented high levels of anxiety, depression amongst survivors of SARS (35%) [35] , quarantined individuals (31%) [36] , and nurses (38.5%) [34] . Additionally, previous studies had found that associated higher stress levels, depression, and anxiety symptoms tend to persist over time within health care workers [37] and survivors of SARS [16] . The psychological and behavioral responses of these individuals may relate to differences in the appraisal and interpretation of major concerns such as a sense of losing control of the situation, contracting SARS in public, as well as its effects on the wellbeing of family members (Table 4 ) [38, 39] . This has negative impact on the social functioning of the individuals as evidenced by the lower scores on the same affected domain in GHQ, thus underlining the need to address the community psychosocial responses in any situation-specific mental health program related to an infectious disease outbreak. Of note, psychiatric morbidity was associated with being seen at fever stations which may reinforce the sense of vulnerability and threat of infection, and this can interact with the younger age to produce more severe stress symptoms [40] . Our finding of an association of psychiatric morbidity with younger age is consistent with the results of our study on health care workers [31] as well as the study by Leung et al. [41] who found that greater anxiety was associated with younger age within the community. The relationship between psychiatric morbidity and younger age may be related to differences in coping styles within younger individuals including greater self blame as revealed by the multivariate analyses in Table 2 . The use of self blame may reflect an underlying sense of frustration and guilt related to responsibility attribution and interpersonal reactions which can, in turn, contribute to psychiatric morbidity [42, 43] . The less use of substance in our study is in line with a previous local study of coping responses of staff within an emergency room setting [32] but is contrary to the findings of some previous studies [44, 45] , which had noted increased substance use in individuals facing stress. Furthermore, subjects with psychiatric morbidity and posttraumatic stress symptoms employed different coping strategies. Individuals with posttraumatic morbidity tended to use denial and planning as coping measures. Denial may reduce the sense of powerlessness in the face of overwhelming stress and frustration, thus enhancing coping efficacy in the context of post traumatic morbidity [46] . Denial could also be a maladaptive coping strategy, hence predisposing individuals to develop post-traumatic symptoms. Alternatively, it is also possible that those with posttraumatic symptoms may be 3. Social responsibility (2) inherently more predisposed to using denial as a coping measure in the first place. In addition, those individuals with posttraumatic morbidity may then actively plan about what to do and outline steps taken in order to deal with the outbreak. Safeguarding the mental health of the community is as important as that of the medical staff since it can potentially affect the success of the delivery of health care within the community [12] . Access to appropriate psychological assistance in the community is important as the risk of future outbreaks remains real. These findings could potentially inform the formulation of much needed mental health awareness programs for the community who may face similar disease outbreaks in the future. Based on this data, the following points could be considered in the design of community mental health programs for infectious disease outbreaks: (1) understanding that most people cope well but at the same time to identify early those individuals who are at risk for psychological morbidities such as younger individuals and those who are being monitored at specific fever stations; (2) addressing the myriad of emotional responses that may be present such as anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, fear of contagion, losing control, recurrence, concern about personal health, health of family and friends and hope for a cure, and understanding that these reactions may occur in the context of normal adaptive responses to stress; (3) access to and timely provision of practical information to the community regarding the disease outbreak in order to decrease uncertainty concerning the disease; (4) establishing and enhancing social support networks within subsectors of the community which can buffer against distress or negative psychological responses; (5) allowing time to foster adaptive coping strategies, whether problem-, emotion-, or meaning-focused, within the community.",

First, this study was conducted on individuals seen at the community health care setting, and thus, the results may not necessarily generalize to all noninfected individuals seen at other private health care centers. Second, other factors that could potentially contribute to the complex psychosocial responses of an individual such as personality variables, cognitive appraisal mechanisms, and past trauma were not examined in this study. Third, it is possible that some of the participants who visited primary heath care centers may be self selected or worried well and who were more predisposed to the development of psychiatric morbidity. Fourth, recall bias can still be a potential confounder although measures had been taken during the recruitment process to minimize this as much as possible.",

The association with younger age and being seen at fever stations may allow better identification of individuals at risk of developing psychological morbidities. The relationship of different coping styles in those with psychological morbidity allows a better understanding of their use in these individuals. Further research is needed to validate and extend these findings in similar disease situations as well as outbreaks of other infectious diseases. This data, together with that of other studies, can hopefully inform the development of practical and responsive mental health programs for the community and emphasizes significant aspects including an understanding of normal coping mechanisms, addressing the myriad of emotions that may surface, enhancing social support, timely dissemination of information, and encouraging the development of adaptive coping strategies during such times.",
