Clearly identify the goals, objectives and terms of a needs assessment survey after assessing results already published from previous surveys. . After designing the survey (e.g., observation, intervention, epidemiological or other), secure ethics approval at the appropriate administrative level and/or locale. . Draw respondents randomly from geographically dispersed sites, or from well-defined experts, professionals, laypersons and focus groups. . Avoid surveying special interest groups, which later courts of law or other legal bodies may deem hearsay not representative of randomly sampled larger populations, and therefore, invalid. . Perform surveys of adequate breadth, depth and sample size to yield significant comparisons of predefined variables in a comprehensive balance of closed-and open-ended questions. . Achieve an adequate response rate through use of facile media (e.g., SurveyMonkey), personal interviews, repetitive encouragement, follow-up communications and appropriate incentives. . Use original methods, such as trade-off questions, statistically validate results and base claims only on comparisons with p values <0.05. . Consider the broader context of national policies and guidelines, cost-effectiveness and market sustainability while simultaneously targeting outcomes people want, business realities and technical feasibility. . Integrate small-world network analysis with consideration of disasters, emergencies, outbreaks, and public health resilience. These specifications present serious challenges for technology designers, because implicit in them is low cost. However, our global field experience has shown that cost-effectiveness is attained by assessing the overall value of POC diagnostics, not just the costs, despite the practical challenges and economic realities of enabling appropriate value propositions. Also, the WHO target population [4] , \"Patients presenting with fever to health care facilities for assessment,\" misses the point, a serious error. To stop an outbreak, POC detection should be substantially upstream at the first point of contact before sick febrile patients spread the disease to others. The first point of contact is anywhere that POCT can be used. The WHO concept of waiting until the patient presents with fever is too far downstream in the SCP and therefore too late to stop outbreaks.",

Now nearly a decade later, the FDA is accelerating the ongoing development, validation and approval of new diagnostic tests for Ebola by issuing EUAs more or less continuously since Fall 2014. TABLE 3 presents the EUAs in chronological order with their respective methods and status of development. Ebola-specific challenges for molecular diagnostics include: i) reduction in initial false negatives, FN = FN(t), as a function of time, to ramp up sensitivity, {TP/[TP + FN(t)]}, to ultrahigh levels in infected patients during the first 72 h when symptoms may be mild or absent, in order to avoid shunting false-negative cases to community hospitals ill prepared to receive high-risk patients (TP is true positive); ii) automation of totally self-contained and sealable specimen cassettes and cartridges to eliminate need for expensive high level biosafety cabinets; iii) proof of effectiveness in controlling internal contamination in portable instruments, thereby sustaining ultrahigh specificity [TN/(TN + FP)] and minimizing false positives, which place people at risk when near infected patients (TN is true negative and FP false positive); and as more sophisticated but compact technologies become available; and iv) determination of quantitative viral genome titers, which will be useful for early detection of exposure in small volumes of specimen and also for de-escalating the level of care and quarantine as the patient improves. When performed properly with biohazard precautions in the near-patient testing area of the diagnostic center, results will be available much more quickly than sending specimens to a public health laboratory or to the CDC [37, 38] . The gain in time can be substantial, less than 1 h needed to obtain an answer (see TABLE 3 ), which facilitates rapid screening, focused triage and effective workflow. In West Africa, these practical efficiencies can help offset professional shortages in countries with large numbers of people per physician, such as 70,000:1 in Liberia (fatality rate 43.0%), 45,000:1 in Sierra Leone (28.7%) and",

World financial losses from Ebola and other outbreaks warrant investment [48] , which should be directed not just to vaccines [49] , but also to the development POC molecular diagnostics, for which there is precedent [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . .

Diagnostic centers with controlled environmental conditions placed along SCPs will motivate industry to respond to WHO calls [3] for robust diagnostic tests [4] and consolidate community efforts on a cost-effective broader scale. .

Adaptations in SE Asia and in individual USA hospitals, such as isolation areas in Atlanta, Dallas, New York, Bethesda (NIH Clinical Center) and Omaha, are notable, but have not yet generated isolation bed capacity nor adequate experience quickly enough to deal with potentially large numbers of cases from infectious disease outbreaks in the future. .

In regard to internal threats, the government, academia and private companies must disclose information about problems that have occurred at secured biolabs, so that communities can set medical, financial and public health priorities. People have a right to know when safety violations occur. In fact, laypersons should be given more weight on oversight committees. . For external threats, such as Ebola or new infectious disease threats, strategic planers must reshape public health for resilience at points of need. In June 2015, MERS-CoV, for which a feasible rapid POC molecular diagnostic [63] and one FDA EUA [64] exist, but for which there is no vaccine or definitive treatment, was spreading throughout South Korea [65, 66] 17 ,000 had been placed in quarantine and 12 remained hospitalized [67] . Second quarter South Korean growth was the worst in 6 years, the government announced a 22-trillion won stimulus package and the economic growth forecast was cut from 3.1 to 2.8%. Hence, we can predict heavy economic impact from future threats in ASEAN + 6 countries. . MERS-CoV was not suspected and health care workers did not treat the first patient in isolation. Some of the infected people occupied the same room as the first patient, and others had been in the same ward for times ranging from 5 min to several hours. Said the Prime Minister, Park Geunhye, \"there were some insufficiency in the initial response, including the judgment on its contagiousness [65] .\" How many times will this scenario repeat, at what economic and medical costs, and to whom, before responses are properly strategized, restructured and enabled at the points of first contact, need and care? . Therefore, in summary, we recommend accelerating proactive planning, national preparedness, development of new POC technologies [68] and especially field evaluation, which, in the case of Ebola, has demonstrated high sensitivity and interesting POC results in clinic settings [69] .",

Intrinsic to emerging POC culture [5, 43, 44] is the popular expectation of rapid diagnosis [45] of high-risk viruses using disposable test strips, selfcontained automated technologies and other mobile cartridge-, cassette-or cuvette-based approaches. Diagnostics that properly fulfill these expectations, and those popular expectations are the keys to motivation, in the next 5 years while delivering ultrahigh sensitivity, specificity and predictive values will help stifle outbreaks in the USA and other countries before they succumb to future threats and untoward economic losses. Multiplex PCR assays are particularly beneficial in cases when samples are difficult to collect or short on volume, and when different pathogens create the same clinical constellation of symptoms and signs. Additionally, the instant traceability of infected or potentially infected individuals by knowing multiplex results, locations, and movement over time and across borders can help contain the spread of highly contagious diseases. FAST POC TM , self-knowledge and enabled people who take ownership of personalized diagnostic testing will interrupt the rapid spread of outbreaks, an impactful shift in public health to immediate diagnosis at points of need and a new POC culture in public health.",
