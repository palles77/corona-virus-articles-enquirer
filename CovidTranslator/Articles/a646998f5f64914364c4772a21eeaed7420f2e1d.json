When several mammalian coronaviruses were classified on the basis of antigenic relatedness it was found that the hemagglutinating coronaviruses could be classed into one of two major antigenic subgroups, although not all viruses within this subgroup had hemagglutinating properties (Pederson et al., 1978) . Included in this subgroup were the hemagglutinating bovine enteric coronavirus, the porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, the hema~utinating human respiratory coronavirus 0C43, and the no~ema~u~ating mouse hepatitis virus 3. In this paper we report that the molecule responsible for hemagglutination by the bovine coronavirus is apparently one of four surface $y;;roSns, gp140, which exists as a disulfide-linked dimer of two glycoproteins of Plaque purified bovine coronavirus (Mebus strain) was grown either on the bovine embryo kidney cell line BEK-1 (Inaba et al., 1976) or on the human rectal tumor cell line HRT-18 (Tompkins et al,, 1974f as described (King and Brian, 1982) . Virus grown on either cell line was virtually identical as judged from electrophoretic profiles of viral proteins. Virus, purified by isopycnic sedimentation as described (King and Brian, 1982) , was solubilized in 0.0625 M Tris HCl, pH 6.8/2% SDS/5 M urea, electrophoresed by the method of kaemmli (1970) , and immunoblotted by the method of Towbin et. al. (1979) as modified by Bumette (1981) except that proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose with a gradient of 100 V for 2 h and nitrocellulose wash buffer consisted of 150 mM NaCl/S mM EDTA/SO mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4/0.25% gelatin/0.5% Triton/O.l% SDS. Antiserum was prepared by immunizing separate rabbits with 144, 240, 552, and 264 pg each of SDS-polyacrylamide gel-purified gp120-gp100 (combined), 'gp65, pp52 and gp26 respectively. Proteins used for immunization were prepared from virus purified by isopycnic and rate-zonal sedimentation as previously described (King and Brian, 1982) . Polyacrylamide plugs containing isolated proteins were minced, divided into three portions, and each [ 3H]Amino acid-labeled BCV was purified as described (King and Brian, 1982) . One third was incubated in TMN buffer (50 mM Tris acid maleate, pH 6/100 mM NaCl) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and resedimented isopycnically (panel A). One third was incubated in TMN containing 1.3 mg/ml bromelain (Sigma Chemical Co.) and 50 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37\"C, a modified procedure of Compans et al. (1970) and resedimented isopycnically (panel B). One third was treated with pronase for 1 h at 37\u00b0C as previously described (King and Brian, 1982) and resedimented isopycnically (panel C). The buoyant densities were determined from the refractive index of each fraction. 10 ~1 aliquots of each fraction were assayed for acid-precipitable radioactivity and hemagglutinating activity. Peak fractions of each gradient were separately pooled and analyzed by electron microscopy and gel electrophoresis. portion was emulsified with 400 pg N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-l%soglutamine (Calbiochem) prior to subcutaneous injection. Single portion amounts were injected at 2 week intervals. Serum was diluted 1: 10 for immunoblotting experiments. When each of the antisera was used in separate immunoblotting experiments, only antiserum prepared against gp65 reacted with gp140 under non-reducing conditions or with gp65 when 2-mercaptoethanol was included in the solubilization buffer (Fig. 1 , and data not shown). Prei~une serum did not react with this protein nor did immune serum react with a protein from uninfected cells (data not shown). Gp65 and gp140 therefore behave as monomeric and dimeric forms of the same polypeptide supporting the tentative conclusion made in our earlier report (King and Brian, 1982) .",

            "text": "While trying different proteases to remove the external proteins of BCV we observed that bromelain-treated virus still hemagglutinated mouse erythrocytes whereas pronase completely destroyed this activity (Fig. 2) . The hemagglutinating titer of bromelain-treated virus was observed in nine experiments to range from 100 to 800% of that observed for an equal amount of untreated virus. Both enzymes decreased the buoyant density of the virus by appro~mately 0.01 gm/cm3, however (Fig. 2) . Since pronase was shown to remove or drastically reduce all surface glycoproteins of the virion (King and Brian, 1982) , bromelain-treated and pronase-treated virus were analyzed by electrophoresis in parallel to determine which protein(s) might be responsible for hemagglutination. Virus radiolabeled with [3H]amino acids and purified as described (King and Brian, 1982) , was divided equally for the various treatments and resedimented isopycnically (Fig. 2) . Electrophoretic analysis of particles from the peak regions of each gradient revealed that bromelain treatment altered the integrity of all glycoproteins excepting gp140, or gp65 when virus was el~trophore~d with 2-mer~aptoethanol, and left the internal protein pp52 intact (Fig. 1) . The molar amounts of gp65 relative to internal pp52 remained the same after bromelain treatment (Table 1 ). In addition, several poly- peptides migrating faster than pp52 appeared after bromelain treatment that resembled those observed after pronase treatment (King and Brian, 1982, Fig. l) , namely a minor 50 kDa species, a broad band of polypeptides in the region of 38 kDa, and an abundant 22 kDa species. We interpret these to be envelope-associated, digestion-resistant fragments of gp120, gplO0 and gp26 that, on the basis of size alone, appear to represent nearly the same portion of the molecule regardless of the enzyme used. Further experimentation is needed to determine the exact origin of these species, however. These data, along with those demonstrating gp140, gp120, gplO0 and gp26 to be surface glycoproteins (King and Brian, 1982) suggest that gp140 is the BVC hemagglutinin.",

The short projections may be the structural counterparts of gp140 but may also represent bromelain resistant fragments of other glycoprotein species. Projections of two different sizes have been reported for the bovine coronavirus (Bridger et al., 1978) . Increased hemagglutinability following bromelain digestion could be explained by a removal of the large peplomers that sterically interfere with the interaction of erythrocytes and the hemagglutinin. Consistent with gp140 being the hemagglutinin protein we find that the antigenitally related hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (unpublished data) and hemagglutinating human coronavirus 0C43 (Hogue et al., 1984) also contain an antigenically related gp140 molecule that behaves as a disulfide-linked dimer of 65 kDa molecules. The non-hemagglutinating mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59, on the other hand, does not have this molecular counterpart as evidenced by direct electrophoretic analysis and immunoblotting studies using the rabbit anti-gp65 serum employed in the experiment described in Fig. 1 (Hogue et al., 1984) . A report by Callebaut and Pensaert (1980) also describes a 140 kDa disulfide-linked, dimeric glycoprotein for the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine, that, in a semipurified form, interferes with hemagglutination by this virus. These experiments also suggest the 140 kDa glycoprotein functions as the hemagglutinin molecule. Interestingly, in the studies of Callebaut and Pensaert, bromelain did destroy the hemagglutinating properties of the virus suggesting there may be some distinct structural differences between BCV and the porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus.",
