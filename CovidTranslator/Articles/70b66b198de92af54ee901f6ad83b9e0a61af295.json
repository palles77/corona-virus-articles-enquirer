The cytotoxin (31,700 Mr) lacks an N-terminal signal sequence for bacterial secretion but contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence commonly found in prokaryotic proteins which function in a TonBdependent manner. The cytotoxin gene has a [G + C]content of 53.8% which is considerably lower than generally observed for genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cytotoxin gene was exclusively detected in strain 158 but not in three other clinical isolates, as determined by Southern and Northern hybridization. The latter technique revealed that the toxin is translated from monocistronic m R N A . The promoter of the cytotoxin is inactive in Escherichia coli. U p o n site-directed modification of the 5'-noncoding region by the polymerase chain reaction the gene was expressed under control of the trcpromoter. The gene product obtained in Escherichia coli was nontoxic. Toxicity was induced by subsequent treatment with trypsin.",

The Sau3A/PstI-fragment was isolated from the gel and cloned under L3-B1 biosafety containment facilities into BamHI/PstI-digested pUC19. The insert was isolated by digestion with PstI and SmaI, nick-translated and used to screen PstI/HincIIand PstI/EcoRV-libraries. 12 overlapping M13 clones, together spanning the entire toxin gene (Fig 1) , were sequenced on both strands to establish the complete structure employing the chain termination method (Sanger et al. 1977) . Computer assisted analyses were performed with the PC-Gene program purchased from Genofit (Geneva, Switzerland). annealing of the oligonucleotides was performed at 45 ~ C for 2 min, the polymerization reaction was at 72~ for 3 min. Through this procedure a singular FokI-site was introduced Into the 5'-noncoding region.

The [G + C]-content of the coding region (53.8%) is significantly lower than that reported for chromosomally integrated genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (West and Iglewski 1988) , indicating that the gene could originally stem from a different organism. This hypothesis is further supported by our finding that the cytotoxin gene is absent in three other clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as evidenced by Southern analyses (Fig. 4A, B) . Even after 45 PCR-cycles (using oligonucleotides binding immediately upstream and downstream from the coding region and 20 ng of chromosomal DNA) these other strains failed to produce a signal in Southern blotting. In addition, Northern blot analyses of R N A from the individual strains also indicated the absence of cytotoxin-specific transcripts (data not shown). The open reading frame was followed by two inverted repeat structures indicated by divergent arrows in Fig. 3 . The free energy values (Tinoco et al. 1973) of these stem-loop structures, -9 2 . 0 5 K J/tool and -7 9 . 5 KJ/mol, suggest that they could function as transcription-termination signals. Northern blot analyses of R N A from strain 158 revealed that the cytotoxin-specific m R N A had a size of about 1100 nucleotides (data not shown). Taken together, these data support the conclusion that the cytotoxin gene is transcribed into monocistronic mRNA. ",

The cytotoxin sequence did not reveal a significant sequence similarity with any other known protein. It is important to note that no proteolytic processing of the N-terminus of the protein occurs during or after bacterial autolysis.

Within the N-terminal domain, a remarkable homology to a pentapeptide consensus sequence (TonB-box), commonly found in outer membrane receptor proteins of the Escherichia coli iron transport system, was detected. As yet, the TonB-box was found exclusively in all proteins that function in a TonB-dependent manner . Interestingly, this group of proteins contains also some colicins known to kill closely related bacteria by pore formation. Uptake of such colicins by the target cell occurs in a receptor mediated and TonB-dependent process . Recent modifications of the TonB-box from the FhuA receptor by site-directed mutagenesis (Sch6ffier and Braun 1989) have shown that a replacement of the Va111 residue by aspartic acid only weakened the colicin M sensitivity of the Escherichia coli strain indicating that the interaction between the FhuA receptor and the TonB protein was not completely abolished. At present, we do not know whether the cytotoxin serves a colicin-like function for Pseudomonas aeruginosa,",

This material migrated clearly faster than the 30,000 Mr species obtained by in vitro transcription/ translation or by expression in Escherichia coli. Although the in vitro synthesized material bound specifically to membrane preparations from Ehrlich ascites cells, exhibiting properties indistinguishable from the mature [125I] labeled cytotoxim this non-processed form was nontoxic in the granulocyte lysis assay. Cytotoxicity clearly required proteolytical processing which in autolysates was mediated by endogenous proteases. Trypsintreatment of Escherichia coli lysates also restored cytotoxicity. Such processing could involve only C-terminal sequences, since identical N-termini were determined by Edman degradation and by DNA-sequencing. The mechanism by which pore formation through the cytotoxin is induced is far from being understood at the molecular level. We show here that binding to peripheral acceptor sites does not require proteolytic processing and Coulton et al. 1986 Sauer et al. 1987 Heller and Kadner/985 Pressler et al. 1988 Lundrigan and Kadner 1986 Griggs et al. 1987 Krone et al. 1985 K6ck et al. 1987 Schramm et al. 1987 Mankovich et al. 1984 also does not involve the N -t e r m i n a l sequences, since the in vitro synthesized c y t o t o x i n had similar binding p r o p e m e s like the m a t u r e molecule.
