They are generated through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and release of interluminal vesicles. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that macrophages infected with Mycobacterium release exosomes that promote activation of both innate and acquired immune responses; however, the components present on exosomes inducing these host responses were not defined. The present study used LC-MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFP) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFP-treated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present on exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis-infected cells. The exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could promote macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as activation of na\u00efve T cells in vivo. These results suggest that exosomes containing M. tuberculosis antigens may be alternative approach to developing a tuberculosis vaccine.",

Exosomes are one type of bioactive vesicle that has received considerable attention, as they are derived from the release of intraluminal vesicles upon fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane and therefore contain constituents present in the endocytic network [1] [2] . Moreover, exosomes are functionally diverse and known to be released from numerous cell types including cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origin. Exosome release was originally observed in maturing reticulocytes and appears to function in eliminating non-essential proteins from the maturing red blood cells. Later studies demonstrated that exosomes derived from B cells and other antigen presenting cells were enriched for MHC class II, as well as co-stimulatory molecules like CD86 and could present antigens to sensitized T cells [3] . More recent studies have shown that exosomes carrying tumor antigens can promote antigen-specific T cell activation and tumor rejection in vivo [4] .",

However, the mycobacterial proteins present on isolated exosomes which could promote T cell activation were not defined in this study. Therefore, to address this question we established the first extensive proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected macrophages. Our analysis identified 41 mycobacterial proteins including some well known antigenic proteins such as ESAT-6 (Rv3875), Ag85 complex (Rv3804c, Rv1886c, Rv0129c), MPT64 (1980c) , and MPT63 (1926c). We also found that J774 cells incubated with M. tuberculosis (M.tb) culture filtrate proteins released exosomes containing a number of the highly antigenic M.tb proteins. Moreover, these exosomes could stimulate macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) activation in vitro and activate na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo suggesting a possible use for these exosomes as a TB vaccine.",

As seen in Table 1 , the in-gel methodology generated the most abundant highquality spectra. For this reason, exosomes purified from irradiated-M.tb infected and CFPtreated J774 cells were only processed via this protocol. In-solution analysis: 10 \u03bcg of each sample was added to breaking buffer to a final volume of 500 \u03bcL. Breaking buffer is composed of 50 mL of phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Gibco) with 1 mM EDTA, 30 \u03bcL DNase stock (1 mg/mL) and 30 \u03bcL RNase stock (1 mg/mL). Lysis of exosomes was achieved by sonication on ice with a micro-tip probe using 5 rounds of 60 sec pulses with 90 sec of rest between. The resultant lysates were denatured in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, reduced with 10 mM DTT and alkylated in 100 mM iodoacetamide.

To determine the mycobacterial protein components present on exosome that could serve as the antigens to promote the T cell response, we performed a proteomic analysis of exosomes released from M.tb-infected J774 cells. Tryptic digest of exosomal proteins was performed by both in-solution and in-gel to optimize mass spectrometry, as well as maximize protein identifcations. A total of 41 mycobacterial proteins were identified (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 2 & 3 ). In this group were a number of well-known M.tb antigens including the antigen 85A, B and C (Rv3804c, Rv1886c, Rv0129c), MPT64 (Rv1980c), and ESAT-6 (Rv3875) [13] . The presence of the 85A was particularly interesting as this protein is part of a subunit vaccine currently in clinical trial [14] . The presence of a number of well-known immuno-dominant M.tb antigens on exosomes (highlighted in table) likely explains our previous observation that exosomes from BCG-infected J774 cells can activate na\u00efve T cells when injected intranasally into C57Bl/6 mice [7] .

As expected both exosome populations contained the host protein lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1). With the exception of the identification of LpqH and SodA, the western blot analysis is consistent with the findings observed through our shotgun proteomic approach (Table 1) . Due to the complexity of the exosome samples and the inclusion of murine proteins in the mass spectrometry analysis, it is likely that the LpqH and SodA peptides were either less susceptible to ionization or suppressed by the abundant host peptides. The benefit of this LC-MS/MS analysis was our ability to identify exosomal proteins without the need for additional detection reagents (ie antibodies), as well as discovering proteins that were not predicted. In addition, previous studies indicated that CFP-10 and ESAT-6 are secreted from the M.tb as a complex [16] and suggest that these proteins might also be in exosomes. While we observed the presence of CFP-10 by western blot, we found that exosomes released from infected J774 cells also contain ESAT-6 by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 1 , Table 1 ).",

To begin testing this hypothesis we treated macrophages with proteins actively secreted from M.tb (i.e. the culture filtrate proteins) with the anticipation that at least some of the mycobacterial proteins will be endocytosed and trafficked to MVBs and exosomes. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies where macrophages exposed to Toxoplasma gondii protein antigens produced exosomes containing a subset of these proteins [17] . We observed a similar finding as exosomes isolated from culture filtrate protein treated J774 cells (CFP-exosomes) contained many of the same proteins we observed in exosomes released from M.tb-infected macrophages including the antigen 85 complex, GroES, MPT63 among others (Table 1 and 2). In fact only 6 unique proteins were found in CFP-exosomes. This is not surprising since 95% of the proteins found in exosomes from M.tb-infected J774 cells have been experimentally shown or computationally predicted to be secreted (Table 1 ). In summary, 41 mycobacterial proteins were identified on exosomes from M.tb-infected J774 cells while 29 were identified from CFP-treated cells (Supplementary Tables 4 & 5) . Of these 29 identified proteins, 25 (86%) were identical to those observed from M.tb infected cells (Fig. 2) .",

The similar IFN-\u03b3 production by splenocytes treated ex vivo with CFPexosomes compared to CFP alone also suggest that either the exosomes contain the most potent M.tb culture filtrate antigens or that the exosomes are more efficient at transferring a limited number of M.tb antigens to antigen presenting cells for presentation to antigenspecific T cells.",

To test this prediction, mice were administered intranasally with exosomes from uninfected or CFPtreated cells +/\u2212 adjuvant as described in Material and Methods and 2 weeks after the final vaccination the lungs, MLN and spleens were harvested. Single cell suspensions were stimulated ex vivo with CFP and the T cells were analyzed for proliferation, IFN-\u03b3 production and memory phenotype. As shown in figures 5, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from mice treated with CFP-exosomes showed increased production of IFN-\u03b3 upon restimulation with CFP and this was evident in all three organs. The adjuvant did not have a significant effect on the number of T cells which were positive for IFN-\u03b3 suggesting that exosomes contain both adjuvant as well as antigenic properties. This conclusion is supported by the data shown in figure 3 which indicates that exosomes from CFP-treated cells can promote DC activation. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from mice treated with CFPexosomes but not from mice treated with uninfected exosomes also showed increased proliferation when stimulated ex vivo with CFP ( Fig. 5D and E) . Previous studies indicated that antigen-specific effector memory cells may play an important role in protection against M.tb in BCG vaccinated individuals [18] [19] . Therefore we addressed whether effector memory cells were produced in mice vaccinated with CFP-exosome and found CD44 hi , CD62L low CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which is indicative of effector memory cells, in all three organs ( Fig. 5F and G) . Together, the data suggests that vaccination of mice with exosomes isolated from CFP-treated J774 cells can induce a profile of T cell activation often associated with M.tb control (i.e. IFN-\u03b3 production and effector memory cells).",

The exosomes activated both the innate and acquired immune responses suggesting the presences of multiple mycobacterial components. However, in these previous reports only the antigen 85 complex was identified. In the present study an MS proteomics approach was taken to identify the mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes released from M.tb-infected J774 cells. A surprisingly high number of mycobacterial proteins (i.e. 41) were identified along with a number of expected host proteins. Why the high number and why these particular proteins? Most of the identified proteins are known to be secreted by M.tb and some, including the fibronectin attachment protein) have been shown previously to be released outside the phagosome [21] . Recent studies have identified two major mechanisms by which proteins are targeted to the intraluminal vesicles of MVBs for subsequent release on exosomes. One involves ubiquitination of proteins which is recognized by the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery for subsequent trafficking and retention of proteins in the intraluminal vesicles [22] . A second mechanism appears to involve aggregation of membrane proteins forming microdomains which may stabilize the exosomal membrane domains [22] . Although we did not find ubiquitination motifs among the different M.tb exosome proteins we could not determine from our analysis whether these proteins are aggregating within the phagosome and subsequently trafficked through the endocytic network into MVBs. In addition to these known pathways there is some evidence to indicated that there may be ESCRT-independent transport mechanisms [23] but whether some or all of the mycobacterial proteins use these alternative targeting pathways must wait until the process is better defined. This is further complicated by the lack of studies addressing the mechanism of phagosomal protein trafficking to MVBs which may differ from how plasma membrane or endosomal proteins are targeted to MVBs and exosomes.",

Other studies have shown the HIV Gag protein, when expressed in cells, shows preferential targeting to MVBs and release on exosomes [26] . Studies by Raposo and colleagues have shown that prion protein (PrP) in both its normal and scrappie conformation are trafficked to MVBs and released on exosomes [27] .

To what degree exosomes promote or inhibit immunity will likely depend on what mycobacterial components are present on the exosomes at any given time. The proteomic analysis of exosomes released from infected macrophages as described in this study is the first venture into dissecting their protein composition. Future studies will be needed to define how exosome composition may change over time particularly during the course of an in vivo infection and how this correlates with bacterial burden and the stage of infection. The eventual goal is to better understand exosome's role during the course of an M.tb infection. Nevertheless, our previous studies demonstrate that exosomes isolated from M. bovis BCG-infected J774 cells could activate both na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells suggesting that under some conditions exosomes from infected macrophages can promote an acquired immune response. This also suggests that exosomes with the right subset of M.tb components may function as a viable vaccine candidate and the presence of highly antigenic M.tb proteins on the isolated exosomes support this possibility. Members of the 85 complex which are proteins found on exosomes were originally described as a prominent TB antigens in animal models and within infected humans [30] [31] . Subsequent subunit vaccine studies in non-human primates showed that this antigen along with another well-known antigen ESAT-6 provides protection against M.tb infection [32] . Clinical trials are presently ongoing using a Ag85B-ESAT-6 fusion protein as a subunit vaccine.",

Interestingly, we found 29 M.tb proteins on these exosomes. There are approximately 205 M.tb proteins in the culture supernatant [15] so our findings that 29 of these including ESAT-6 and the 85 complex are trafficked to MVBs and exosomes suggest an efficient transport mechanism. However, why these specific M.tb proteins are targeted is not known.",

This indicates that these proteins are targeted to MVBs and exosomes independent of whether they traffic through the phagosome or through endocytic pathway. It is important to note that the M.tb is washed prior to the macrophage infection and there is no culture supernatant added to the cells at the time of infection. The \"feeding\" of proteins to DC, B cells or macrophages to produce exosomes containing the added proteins has been performed in the context of tumor antigens [33] [1] as well as microbial antigens from Toxoplasma gondii [34] , diphtheria toxin from Streptococcus pneumoniae [35] and spike S protein from the SARS-associated cornavirus [36] suggesting that this may be a mechanism to \"engineer\" exosomes to contain specific proteins. However, before this method can reach its full potential we need a better understanding of how proteins are trafficked to MVBs and exosomes.",

            "text": "We hypothesized that since these exosomes derived from CFP-treated J774 cells contained known M.tb antigens it could function to promote activation of na\u00efve T cells in vivo and our data supports this hypothesis. The number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells which produced IFN\u03b3 upon ex-vivo stimulation was comparable to our previous studies when exosomes from BCG-infected macrophages were used for vaccination [7] . The same held true for the production of effective memory T cells. The similar levels of T cell activation induced by exosomes from CFP-treated and BCG-infected macrophages suggest that in our mouse model they share the major antigens that are inducing the acquired immune response. However, which of these 25 shared M.tb proteins are the major contributors to the T cell response is presently unknown. Nevertheless, the exosomes derived from CFP-treated macrophages have distinct advantages over those generated from M.tb-infected macrophages with the major advantage stemming from the removal of a BSL3 pathogen infection from the exosome-generation process. Moreover, like the exosomes from M.tb infected macrophages, CFP-exosomes did not require adjuvant for activation of na\u00efve T cell in vivo and could promote DC activation and maturation in vitro. In contrast, CFP alone, although capable of inducing T cell activation when injected into mice, could only do so in the presence of adjuvant [37] . This is an important consideration since only Alum has been approved as an adjuvant for use in humans. Future studies will determine whether the CFPexosomes when used to vaccinate mice protects against an M.tb infection.",
