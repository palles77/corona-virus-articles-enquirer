Objectives: We aim to determine the viral content of the air emitted by symptomatic inpatients or longterm care residents with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection (emitters), and in the breathing zones of healthcare workers who attend to them. Design: A prospective pilot study of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was undertaken. Air within 1 m of the patient was sampled using a high volume air sampler. In addition, a lower volume air sampler was placed <1 m from the patient, with another >1 m from the patient. Viral RNA was recovered from the samplers and submitted for quantitative real time PCR. In addition, personal button samplers were provided to HCWs. Results: The air emitted by 15 participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was sampled. Of the patients infected with influenza A, viral RNA was recovered from the air emitted by 9/12 patients using the low-volume sampler; no viral RNA was detected from air emitted by patients with influenza B (n = 3). Influenza virus RNA was recovered from one HCW's sampler. Conclusions: Patients with respiratory virus infection emit virus into the air which disperses to >1 m and may reach the breathing zone of a HCW. This pilot study highlights the feasibility and importance of conducting a larger-scale study to identify determinants of exposure and transmission from patient to HCW.",

In addition, the emergence of novel respiratory viruses * Corresponding author. such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1] highlights the importance of identifying means to control potentially infectious bioaerosols to reduce risks to healthcare personnel and dissemination within healthcare facilities. Limiting spread of viral pathogens is dependent upon our understanding of key determinants for transmission. A substantial body of experimental data has been generated [2, 3] , including the identification of avian influenza A H5N1 viral determinants for mammalian transmission [4, 5] . However, a paucity of clinical studies address outstanding questions on the risk of exposure of healthcare workers to pathogens via the respiratory route. Investigators at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have recovered influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA from small (<4 m) particles in acute care outpatient environments http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.11.002 1386-6532/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. [6, 7] . Bischoff et al. sampled air emitted from individuals with laboratory-confirmed influenza in the hospital setting, demonstrating the presence of viral RNA in droplet nuclei recovered over 1 m from the patient [8] . These studies underscore the potential insights that may be gained from more extensive studies.",

The retrospective nature of the clinical data collection precluded accurate accounts of symptom onset and severity and of influenza vaccination status. Also, although PTFE membrane filters collect particles up to 50 m in size at the flow rate utilized, our approach did not permit finer particle sizing, which may be informative in terms of potential of dispersion and penetration into the lower airways of uninfected bystanders. In addition, detection of viral RNA in the air is not directly representative of viral infectivity and transmission potential. Finally, the limited sample size precludes far-reaching conclusions. We have, however, demonstrated the feasibility for a larger, multi-center prospective study to identify determinants of HCW viral aerosol exposure.",
