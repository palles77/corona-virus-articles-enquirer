            "text": "Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.",

Based on homology to other known coronaviruses 3, 4 , the genome sequence was used for viral transcript prediction and the annotation of ORFs. Coronaviruses use a complex strategy to express their genetic information 5 , and transcription is initiated from defined (and sometimes cryptic) transcription associated sequences 6 . Similar, to other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 29.9 kB RNA genome contains two large ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1ab, predicted to be initially translated into the polyproteins, pp1a, and pp1ab that arises by ribosomal frameshifting ( Figure 1A ). The polyproteins are post-translationally processed by viral encoded proteases to produce 16 proteins that are conserved between coronaviruses and proposed to function in the synthesis of viral RNA and immune evasion 7 . During viral genome replication a set of \"nested\" subgenomic mRNAs are produced that are predicted to encode the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) and at least nine small accessory proteins, some of which are unique to SARS-CoV-2 3, 4 . The subgenomic mRNAs have a common 5' leader sequence and are 3' co-terminal with a polyA tail.",

Furthermore, a recent proteomic study showed that a number of the predicted viral proteins are produced in infected cells, but not all of the predicted viral proteins were detected 10 . We pioneered the use of combining transcriptomics and proteomics to study viral infections in vitro and in vivo, initially using the well characterised respiratory virus, adenovirus but also respiratory syncytial virus and highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses such as Hendra virus [11] [12] [13] . More recently we have focussed on the latest technologies to study the transcriptome of viruses, including direct RNA sequencing on nanopore devices using long read length sequencing. In particular, we developed a novel ORF-centric pipeline to analyse the very large amounts of transcriptomic data generated by this technique 14 . This pipeline was first used on data generated from adenovirus infected cells. The approach rapidly reproduced transcript maps that correlated highly with the previously described transcriptome maps of adenovirus which have been carefully curated over several decades.",

The coronavirus S glycoprotein of coronaviruses is primed for cell entry by host cell proteases that cleave the protein at one or more positions. Cleavage of a \"S1/S2\" site at the boundary of the S1 and S2 domains occurs for some coronaviruses whilst cleavage at a \"S2\" site is common to all coronaviruses and results in activation of a highly conserved fusion peptide immediately downstream of the S2 site [19] [20] [21] . Although the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein shares 97% identity with that of bat coronavirus RaTG13 22 , an important difference is the presence of a four amino acid insertion (681PRRA684) at the S1/S2 cleavage site that introduces a potential furin-like cleavage site 23, 24 . The furin cleavage site is also not found in other \"lineage B\" betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV, but has been detected in betacoronaviruses in other lineages, suggesting that this region has arisen during natural evolution 25 .",

This technique has recently been used to study herpes viruses, coronaviruses and adenovirus transcriptomes 14, 26, 27 . In total, 1,588,330 sequences were base called and passed QC, of those 527,401 were mapped to the BetaCoV/England/02/2020 genome using minimap2 (Figure 1b ). In addition, an average polyA tail length for each transcript was generated using nanopolish and this information was added to the analysis pipeline. A strict cut off of a 20 nt minimum polyA length was employed and 386,903 transcripts passed this test. Accurately determining the 5' end of direct RNAseq transcripts has been shown to be problematic 14, 27, 28 . The accepted model for coronavirus transcription (Figure 1a) proposes that all viral mRNAs have a common 5' end 29 and the analysis herein was further restricted to those transcripts that met this criterion which reduced the total number of identified full length subgenomic mRNA molecules to 72,124. Figure 1c illustrates a transcription map of those transcripts that start at the expected location and have a known ORF as the 5' most ORF. Transcripts that could express all of the predicted ORFs were present, including for the newly predicted ORF10 30 . However, only one transcript was detected and as previously suggested 8,9 the status of this as a genuine transcript needs careful further investigation. Moreover, non-canonical TRS joining events were detected leading to, for example, apparently bone fide subgenomic transcripts coding for ORF7b. this was also recently reported by Kim et al. 8 . The distribution of transcripts with a 5' UTR consistent with the model of coronavirus mRNA expression that would also code for a predicted protein are shown in Table 1 . Also reported are the average polyA tail lengths of each transcript group. These appeared to be shorter than most human eukaryotic transcripts but is consistent with recently reported findings for SARS-CoV- ",

In particular multiple versions of the N protein with distinct small internal deletions were detected for which 20 transcripts that could encode for these proteins were also identified (Supplementary dataset 7).

            "text": "This integrated analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and proteome revealed significant findings, in particular, the identification of an eight aa deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein that potentially effects protein cleavage, cell tropism and infectivity. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is made as a larger precursor that must be primed by cleavage using host cell proteases to enable subsequent viral entry. For different coronaviruses, cleavage can occur at one or more sites (termed the S1/S2 and S2\u00b4 sites) depending on the amino acid consensus sequences present at each site and has major repercussions on host cell tropism and pathogenesis 19 . The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein has a single arginine residue at the S1/S2 site (Figure 2b ), that facilitates cleavage by a number of proteases including trypsin, cathepsin L and TMPRSS11D 32-34 and a consensus sequence for trypsin and/or elastin cleavage at the S2\u00b4 site 35, 36 . By comparison, SARS-CoV-2 has a four amino acid insertion (680SPRR683) in the S glycoprotein that results in the generation of a furin-like cleavage site (682RRAR685) at the S1/S2 boundary that is not present in other lineage B betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and the highly related bat coronavirus RaTG13 23 . Moreover, analysis of a cryo-EM structure of the S glycoprotein showed that the SPRR insertion creates a disordered solvent exposed loop 24 that protrudes from the trimer surface (Figure 3a ). It has been proposed that this region is more available to host cell proteases for processing 24 . The presence of a furin-like cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary results in cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein before viral exit from the cell, whereas the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, lacking a S1/S2 furin cleavage site, exit the cells with the S glycoprotein largely uncleaved, necessitating cleavage prior to or during cell entry 20, 37, 38 .",

This script produces tables indicating where on the genome and how often in the data each junction occurs. Subsequently, nearby events are grouped together for simplicity of analysis.

Although the engineered deletion differed from the naturally occurring deletion described here, this observation suggests that the naturally occurring deletion (in cell culture) enhances the ability of the virus to enter Vero cells and was selected for during passage in Vero cells. This has clear implications for the use of Vero cells to propagate and grow large batches of the virus for research and especially virus batches grown for use in vaccine challenge studies. Moreover, it also raises the possibility that even virus stocks which have been carefully assayed for homogeneity could still spontaneously generate this deletion during animal challenge studies -particularly in non-human primates and perhaps especially in animals from the Chlorocebus genus. Thus, vaccine studies will need to carefully monitor the homogeneity of the challenge virus throughout the study period. In principle viruses carrying the Bristol deletion in the S glycoprotein may well be attenuated in vivo in NHPs. The early emergence of a viral population carrying the within an individual challenge animal would give the false impression that an individual animal had a mild infection. Given that animal studies are required to use the smallest number of animals needed for statistical significance just one event like this could confound the study. Allied to this is the question of how such a deletion may affect therapeutic assessment of monoclonal antibodies directed against the virus. We have already instigated a programme to determine if this deletion also occurs in human clinical isolates and are currently examining the evolution of the S glycoprotein deletant virus in human cell lines to determine whether the furin cleavage site is essential for infection of human cells.",

            "text": ", in the region of the E protein. This finding reinforces the potential of the virus to incur unexpected spontaneous deletions in viral genes during passaging, that are hard to predict and detect, something researchers need to be vigilant for. A recent analysis showed that deletion of ORF8 from human clinical isolates is possible39 and our data shows that novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses containing deletions or even insertions can arise naturally and successfully propagate. As the virus continues to spread and potentially comes under selective pressure from the host response in humans, vaccines and antiviral drugs in the future, vigilance will be required to detect novel rearrangements/deletions.Coronaviruses use a distinctive complex mechanism for genome replication that needs to be considered during bioinformatic analysis of their genomes relative to viruses causing other epidemics and pandemics where the principle driver of viral change would be single nucleotide polymorphisms and/or small (<3nt) insertions/deletions. this we observed a rarer but detectable set of deletions throughout the viral mRNA repertoire with several notable deletions that give rise to uniquely identifiable peptides. This reinforces the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to naturally undergo deletions/rearrangements throughout the genome under selective pressure, something perhaps readily predictable from other coronaviruses but now confirmed directly in at least one cell line. If the plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome follows the same pathway as HCoV-NL63 40 then different isolates will emerge through recombination and this may result in repeat infection as protection will not be effective.The detection of numerous phophorylation sites within critical viral proteins is another key resource. The phosphorylation of the N protein of multiple coronaviruses is wellknown 41-45 and the phosphorylation sites identified lie in either the N-terminal RNA binding domain or interdomain linker 46 . Mapping of the phosphorylation sites on an xray structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal RNA binding domain showed they were surface located (Figure 5). However, we believe this is the first report of phosphorylation of the coronavirus proteins M, nsp3 and S. These are all membrane bound proteins. M protein is critical in forming the viral particle, nsp3 is a key multifunctional component of the replication/transcription machinery and S protein is the major attachment protein respectively 47 . The phosphorylation sites identified on the S glycoprotein may be important in assembly of the trimer. Residues T29, S31, S349, T791 and S816 are all surface located, whilst T240 sits underneath a disordered loop which when phosphorylated, will add negative charge which may influence loop conformation. Residues Y789 and (perhaps to a lesser extent) T791 sit at the subunit interface and may be involved in controlling trimer assembly. S637 and S640 lie in a but are nevertheless potentially interesting. They are close together in sequence and in the loops modelled for the compact folds these model well as hairpins. In the chain with the extended domain, the same loop models in an extended form. This would be consistent with phosphorylation at S637 and S640 forcing the hairpin apart. These are worth exploring as potential control points for spike conformational changes from compact to an extended form. Overall the identification of protein phosphorylation sites is notable but we believe that the greater utility may be that identifying numerous phophorylation sites on viral proteins will open the potential for a rational investigation of clinically licenced kinase inhibitors as antiviral drugs as has previously been observed for SARS-CoV 48 . Finally, this transcriptomic and proteomic dataset is a rich resource for research teams building a picture of this novel virus as it enables an accurate overview of the transcription profile and adds significant new direct observational data for the .

The RTC then generates subgenomic mRNA which canonically contains a sequence present at the 5' end of the viral genome known as the Transcription Regulating Sequence -Leader (TRS -L) linked by discontinuous transcription to one of several similar sequences downstream of pp1ab.
