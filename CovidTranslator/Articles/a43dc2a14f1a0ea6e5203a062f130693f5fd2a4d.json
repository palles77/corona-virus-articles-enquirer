The worse the functional status, the greater the likelihood of infection or colonization with resistant microorganisms (1, 4, 7) . For example, incontinence and impaired mental status have consistently been associated with asymptomatic urinary tract infection (2) . MRSA colonization is more likely to be identified in residents with pressure ulcers or fecal incontinence or who are bed bound or require feeding tubes or urinary catheters (7) . In most cases, impaired functional status is a determinant of admission to long-term care and is not modifiable. If the major predictors of infection in long-term care facilities are poor functional status and co-existing chronic illness, and these conditions cannot be altered, to what extent is it realistic to anticipate that endemic infections can be prevented in such residents? In addition, with the number and severity of existing conditions, how much illness or death is attributable to infections per se, rather than to underlying chronic disease? Assessing the impact of infection on patient outcome in evaluating interventions to prevent infection is, thus, often problematic. An example is a decision to provide comfort care but not to treat pneumonia with antibiotics in severely impaired patients.",

Communication is impaired because of dementia, blindness, or deafness, and clinical assessment is complicated by symptoms associated with chronic conditions, such as cough or incontinence. The very high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria means that, in a patient with nonspecific deterioration in clinical status, a positive urine culture has a low predictive value for identifying symptomatic urinary infection (10) . Similarly, the high prevalence of oropharyngeal colonization with gramnegative microorganisms indicates that isolation of Enterobacteriaceae from the sputum of a person with lower respiratory tract infection has a low predictive value for identifying the infecting microorganism (2).",

The educational level of the staff is often lower than in acute-care facilities. Radiologic and laboratory facilities are often not on site (9) . Diagnostic tests may not be obtained because access to such tests requires patient transfer. Return of test results on microbiologic specimens may be prolonged. The medical record often is inadequate and access to physician resources is limited. As observation without intervention may be the more appropriate management approach in some cases, this physician shortage may lead to overuse of empiric antibiotics. Finally, limited clinical research is available to validate either an overall infection control program or specific components of a program in the long-term care facility.",

Priority issues for evaluation include determining the most appropriate surveillance strategies for endemic infections and identifying outbreaks early and efficiently.

What is appropriate surveillance for endemic infections, and should it be focused only in areas where an opportunity for prevention exists?",

In addition, the feasibility of decreasing or preventing high colonization rates with drug-resistant microorganisms in long-term care facility residents needs to be assessed, since most patients acquire these microorganisms in acute-care facilities. Practices related to antimicrobial-drug use are key to this question. In addition to controlled comparative trials to identify appropriate antimicrobial-drug use, patients who do not require treatment need to be identified. The role of drug therapy in preventing infections is also not adequately studied. Finally, an infection control program may be costly. What are the benefits of such a program? Decreased length of stay, for example, will not usually be a meaningful outcome. Thus, while substantial progress has been made in the past decade in managing infection prevention, many issues still need to be answered. As the elderly population will increase in the next two decades, addressing these problems must be a priority.",
