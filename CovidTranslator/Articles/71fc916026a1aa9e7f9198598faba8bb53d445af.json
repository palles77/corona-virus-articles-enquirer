Blood samples were tested for feline coronavirus (FCoV) messenger RNA (mRNA) by an reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay which has previously been described to have a high specificity in the diagnosis of clinical FIP [Simons AF, Vennema H, Rofina JE, Pol JM, Horzinek MC, Rottier PJM, Egberink HF (2005) A mRNA PCR for the diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis. Journal of Virological Methods 124, 111e116]. Overall we found 14 (54%) of the cats were positive for FCoV including the cat with clinical disease, but the high rate of positivity among healthy cats suggested a poor specificity for the clinical diagnosis of FIP among these cats. It was observed that the positivity rate was highest in cats aged between 6 monthse1 year old. Our findings suggest that FCoVs may be present in the blood samples from healthy cats as well as cats with clinical FIP.",

FECV is extremely widespread in cat populations, often being asymptomatic or causing only mild enteric infections (with a predilection for replication in enterocytes). Molecular studies have suggested that mutations in the FECV genome induce the virulent FIPV variants in infected cats and the presence of these variants coupled with an inadequate immune response leads to the development of a fatal immune-mediated clinical disease e FIP (Benetka et al 2004) . Several factors are recognised to be important in the epidemiology and development of FIP including the age of the cat at the time of viral exposure, genetic factors, stress, the physical condition of the cat, presence of concurrent disease (such as feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus), multi-cat households, dose and strain of FCoV, pre-existing FCoV antibodies and level of cell-mediated immunity response (Hoskins 1993) .",

Thus, it is suggested that the results of RT-PCR must be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical findings for the diagnosis of FIP. Recently though, Simons et al (2005) , reported a RT-PCR assay detecting messenger RNA (mRNA) of the highly conserved M gene of the FCoV genome in peripheral blood cell samples, and the results of this assay appeared to be able to distinguish clinical cases of FIP from other diseases (and from healthy cats) with a high degree of accuracy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of FCoV in blood samples from cats with or without clinical signs of FIP living under different conditions using the primers reported by Simons et al (2005) by mRNA RT-PCR.",

The use of RT-PCR assay has been suggested by several researchers (Benetka et al 2004 , Campolo et al 2005 as a suitable technique for detecting FCoV carrier cats at early periods of infection. However, viraemia has been shown to occur not only in cats with FIP, but also in healthy carriers (Herrewegh et al 1995 , Gunn-Moore et al 1998 , and there are presently no diagnostic assays that distinguish virulent and avirulent FCoV variants.

            "text": "In contrast to the results obtained by Simons et al (2005) we found that 14 of 26 (54%) blood samples from cats were positive for FCoV mRNA, and only one of these cats had clinical disease that was consistent with a diagnosis of FIP. Although long-term monitoring of the outdoor cats in this study could not be performed, we are aware that three of the 13 PCR-positive healthy cats (the three that were housed together in a single house) remained healthy for at least 6 months. These three cats, which were 6, 7 and 13 years old, had previously lived with another cat which had developed FIP-like clinical signs and had died 1 month before this study was undertaken. Overall, we found positive PCR results in 13 of 25 healthy cats (52%), whereas Simons et al (2005) reported positive results in only 5% of healthy cats (and 93% of cats with confirmed FIP). Our detection rate was also higher than that reported by others (Herrewegh et al 1995 , Gunn-Moore et al 1998 who used different RT-PCR technique for detection of FCoVs in blood from healthy cats. We do not know exactly why our results are so different to those of Simons et al (2005) , but they raise important questions over the specificity of this assay in diagnosing clinical FIP. The sequencing of FCoV isolates detected in this study has not yet been completed, but such results may help to clarify whether the positive results relate to infection with FECV or FIPV biotypes. However, the lifestyle of these cats (mainly outdoors, but living in groups and sharing food and toileting areas) would certainly predispose to a high rate of FECV transmission (Kass and Dent 1995 , Pedersen 1995 , Addie et al 1996 , and this may explain the high number of PCR-positive samples.
