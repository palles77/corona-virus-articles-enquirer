Sites of infections were respiratory (44.5%), gastroenteritis (11%), tonsillitis (10.5%), otitis media (7.5%), urinary tract infection (1%), and vaccination-related fever (1%). In 11.5% of children, a combination of different foci was seen, and in 13% of children, no definite site of infection could be established. In 2009, microbiology testing (bacterial/fungal) was positive in 10 of 49 (20%) children compared with 74 of 151 (49%) children in 2010-2013 (P < .01). The number of children treated with antibiotics increased from 34.6% in 2009 to 48.3% in 2010-2013, and the rate of positive virological studies increased from 20% to 48.3% (P < .01). mPCR analysis confirmed viral infections in 52 of 73 cases (71.2%). The most common detected viruses (multiple entries possible) by mPCR were adenovirus (12), human bocavirus (10), enterovirus (9), rhinovirus (7), respiratory syncytial virus (7), corona virus (7), parechovirus (5), parainfluenza virus (5), and human metapneumovirus (3).",

This finding may at least in part be attributable to the specific condition of febrile seizures with the potential underlying diagnosis of meningitis/encephalitis, thus contributing to a \"liberal\" use of antibiotics. It remains, however, somewhat unclear why an increase in the use of antibiotics was seen in our cohort because no substantial changes in antimicrobial stewardship were implemented during this period. The noted increase in the use of diagnostics and antibiotic treatment, however, may be caused by children with more serious infections, because more uncomplicated cases (simple febrile seizure) are treated with minimal interventions, possibly in an outpatient setting. 6 Also, it is important to note that a substantial number of patients were started on antibiotics before they were admitted to the hospital.",

Moreover, children can shed viral nucleic acids of specific pathogens for prolonged periods, and their detection may not be directly associated with the acute illness.",

            "text": "Meyer et al raise a number of interesting points regarding the use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) testing in patients with febrile seizures. In their letter, the authors report findings from their study on the use of antibiotics in patients with febrile seizures before and after the initiation of mPCR testing. In their analysis of 200 children with febrile seizures, they note an increase in rates of positive viral tests after initiation of mPCR, as well as an increase in patients with positive bacterial/fungal testing, which possibly could have contributed to the increase in children treated with antibiotics. Although we look forward to reviewing the complete data in a peer-reviewed manuscript, we recognize that they do highlight the need to understand the use and interpretation of mPCR results in specific populations.In summary, we agree that although viral respiratory testing may contribute to diagnosis, it should be used in conjunction with other factors, including clinical presentation, physical examination, epidemiologic data, and other testing to determine the etiology of acute respiratory illnesses. Meyer et al highlight the need for future studies in this area among specific populations, such as patients with febrile seizures.",
