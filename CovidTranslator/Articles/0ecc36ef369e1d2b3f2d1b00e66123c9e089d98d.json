Its genome encodes a number of proteins involved in virus survival and transmission in its hosts, in particular proteins that inhibit signaling pathways in infected macrophages and, thus, interfere with the host's innate immune response. A recently identified novel ASFV viral protein (pI329L) was found to inhibit the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway, TLR3 being a crucial ''danger detector.'' pI329L has been predicted to be a transmembrane protein containing extracellular putative leucine-rich repeats similar to TLR3, suggesting that pI329L might act as a TLR3 decoy. To explore this idea, we used comparative modeling and other structure prediction protocols to propose (a) a model for the TLR3-Toll-interleukin-1 receptor homodimer and (b) a structural fold for pI329L, detailed at atomistic level for its cytoplasmic domain. As this later domain shares only remote sequence relationships with the available TLR3 templates, a more complex modeling strategy was employed that combines the iterative implementation of (multi)threading/assembly/refinement (I-TASSER) structural prediction with expertise-guided posterior refinement. The final pI329L model presents a plausible fold, good structural quality, is consistent with the available experimental data, and it corroborates our hypothesis of pI329L being a TLR3 antagonist.",

Although not a human pathogen, this virus is a serious concern to swine farming and livestock economy, as it is endemic in Sardinia and sub-Saharan countries. The increasing infections in Africa and the worldwide commercial trade provide serious risk factors to the global pig industry; plus, there is no vaccine and so control is still based on diagnosis and the subsequent adoption of strict sanitary measures. 1 ASFV is a large, cytoplasmic, double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus and the single member of the Asfarviridae family, encoding many novel genes not encoded by other virus families. As it primarily infects porcine macrophages-a key cellular component of the innate immune system-this virus may have evolved immune evasion genes to manipulate innate immunity. The prediction is that half to two-thirds of the approximately 150 genes encoded by ASFV are not essential for replication in cells but have an important role for virus survival and transmission in its hosts. So far, the major strategy of the known ASFV proteins with roles in evading host defenses seems to interfere with intracellular signaling pathways and to inhibit transcriptional activation of important immunomodulatory genes. 2 This could in part explain the absence of an adequate host response on infection by ASFV.",

There are still a number of ASFV-encoded proteins of unknown function that could be worth exploring for that purpose. The innate immune system is mediated by germline encoded pattern recognition receptors, each receptor having a broad specificity for conserved components of microorganisms, such as nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and lipids. The molecular signature of most viruses is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), produced either as an intermediate of the viral replication cycle (e.g., for dsDNA viruses) or as part of the viral RNA genome. Viral dsRNA is recognized by the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), a member of the well characterized TLR family that comprises 10-20 pattern recognition receptor paralogs, all being type I integral membrane proteins. On dimerization subsequent to recognition of dsRNA, TLR3 recruits the adaptor protein Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (TRIF) to its cytoplasmic domain, thereby initiating a signaling cascade that results in the secretion of type I interferons and other inflammatory cytokines. 3 TRIF is actually the sole TLR adaptor that is able to engage mammalian cell death signaling pathways, and TLR3 is the only receptor in the TLR family that interacts directly with it. Interestingly, ASFV not only infects pigs but also ticks, both of which share TLR-mediated host defense systems. This, and the fact that ASFV specifically infects macrophages, makes it only conceivable that some of the unassigned ASFV-encoded proteins might well interfere with TLR3 or other TLR signaling mechanisms.",

As TLRs are also transmembrane proteins featuring an extracellular domain with LRR motifs, 4 this apparent similarity prompted for experimental testing to check for interference with TLR-signaling. The results showed that pI329L is a highly glycosylated protein expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi, and the cell surface of recombinant lenti-virus transduced cells, and that it inhibits TLR3-dependent activation of two transcription factors (NFjB and IRF3) responsible for the expression of interferon and chemokines (de Oliveira et al. 24 ).

            "text": "In more detail, TLR3 features a large glycosylated ectodomain (ECD) with multiple LRRs responsible for ligand recognition, a transmembrane a-helix and a cytoplasmic TIR domain responsible for initiation of intracellular signaling. The recently proposed structures of two TLR3-ECDs bound to a 46-bp dsRNA (Protein Data Bank [PDB] entry 3ciy 5 ) and of the TLR4-TIR homodimer 6 provided a credible structural picture of how viral dsRNA is recognized and how the signaling adaptors might be recruited. Each of the TLR3-ECDs binds dsRNA at two sites located at opposite ends of the TLR3 horseshoe (refer to Ref. 5 and Fig. 5) , and an intermolecular contact between the two TLR3-ECD C-terminal domains coordinates and stabilizes the dimer. This juxtaposition should then mediate downstream signaling by the dimerization of the cytoplasmic TIR domains. 5 Despite the much shorter sequence of the viral protein, all the above information put together gave rise to the hypothesis that pI329L might form a heterodimer with TLR3, thus acting like a decoy receptor. Here, we report a structural assessment of this hypothesis. Using homology modeling and other structure prediction simulation protocols, we propose (a) a model for the so far experimentally unsolved TLR3-TIR structure, assembled within the context of the overall TLR3-dsRNA recognition complex, and (b) a structural fold for the pI329L intracellular extension that reinforces the idea of the viral protein being a TLR3 antagonist. The computational models are discussed and validated, are consistent with the available experimental data, and preliminary conclusions concerning the role of the ASFV viral protein pI329L are put forward.",

Combining this structural superposition with the PHYRE-proposed alignment of pI329L to NgR, we devised the alignment presented in Figure 3 . Calculated (ClustalW) sequence identity and similarity of pI329L are 15 and 34% to NgR (ECD only) and 11 and 25% to TLR3 (ECD \u00fe transmembrane region). Noticeable from the alignment is the pI329L's LRR pattern (a series of short segments rich in hydrophobic residues such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine 8 ). Also worth mentioning is that the region aligned with the C-terminal cysteine-rich capping motif of NgR and TLR3 (underlined in Fig. 3 ), delineates at least one of the conserved structural disulfide bonds of this motif. In addition, PHYRE predicted a high a-helix content for pI329L in this region (data not shown) in close agreement with the one observed in NgR 7 (highlighted in Fig. 2 ).",

These three receptors were found to be suitable homologous tem-plates for TLR3-TIR, with values of identity and similarity of 26 and 57% (TLR1), 22 and 56% (TLR2), and 27 and 54% (TLR10), respectively, following the alignment in Figure 4 . Compared with the sequence homology among the three templates themselves (identity varies from 46 to 69%), these values emphasize the atypical character of TLR3 within the TLR-family. Unfortunately, none of the available crystallographic structures that could serve as a template has the cytoplasmic linker region-the one immediately following the transmembrane domain, resolved (for the chosen templates, the N-terminal region displayed with the unresolved residues in italic in the alignment of Fig. 4 ). This region is consistently predicted (PHYRE-server) to have an a-helix fold and, at least in the case of TLR3, it bears a few key functional residues that are required for TLR3induced activation of two transcription factors that promote the antiviral response. 4 These are residues Phe732, Tyr733, Leu742, and Gly743 (residue numbering according to Ref. 4) marked with an asterisk in the alignment (Fig. 4) , which are conserved across human, pig, mouse, and other species, respectively.",

It should be pointed out that this is the binding-adaptor loop, which on dimerization shapes a twofold symmetrical exposed patch, 11 where the appropriate TLR adaptor is suggested to dock. In fact, experimental evidence demonstrates the importance of that particular alanine in the binding of TLR3 directly to the adaptor TRIF, while the other TLRs require mediator adaptors. 4 As for a-helix C, it has an extra arginine residue in TLR3 when compared with all other TLRs (the insertion also signaled in the alignment), which no doubt adds to the uniqueness of TLR3 within its family. In fact, this is to say that there might be some complementarity nuances in the dimer's contact region that may not be revealed by homology modeling alone.

The PHYRE server predicts a protein-fold featuring an initial a-helix and three to four small b-strands, with no match to their proposed set of weakly/distant homologous templates. A more sophisticated modeling approach was thus required, one possibility being the iterative implementation of (multi)threading/assembly/ refinement approach (I-TASSER), the ''Zhang-server'' that ranked as the No. 1 server in recent CASP7 and CASP8 experiments (http://predictioncenter.org/casp8/ groups_analysis.cgi).",

The resulting alignment of these two viral protein domains within the secondary structure prediction context is also presented in Figure 6 . The I-TASSER best model was then used for further refinement within Modeller, using the SARS-CoV domain as an additional template. The available TLR structures were used only to guide the modeling of a few localized segments. Two apposite refined models for the pI329L-cytoplasmic domain were obtained in this way, both presenting a plausible fold and good structural quality.

The two models are practically equivalent, differing only in the N-terminal a-helix, which is ''straight'' in one case and ''distorted'' in the other (refer to Fig. 6 ): both motifs are eligible considering that (1) this is the frontier fragment between the transmembrane and cytoplasmatic domains and (2) one such kink would not be uncommon in the region of a potential disulfide bond. Figure 6 . The view in Figure 7 (b) highlights the TLR3-TIR residues that must come into play on homodimer formation, and how pI329L could ''ill-replace'' one of the monomers at the interface region. Whether the outcome is mimic-binding or a more simple steric hindrance, either would suffice to impede the correct formation of the twofold symmetric region where the adaptor TRIF is expected to bind, and disrupt its corresponding signaling. Moreover, at least one of the phosphorylation sites required for downstream regulation 4 (the tyrosine-759 in BOX 1, refer to the alignments in Figs. 4 and 6) would be ousted in this scheme. Arguably, the actual TLR3-region covered by the pI329L cytoplasmic domain would also depend on the positioning of the a-helix cytoplasmic linker in TLR3 (the first 25 residues in the alignment of Fig.  4 , for which there are no template counterpart). The way it has been modeled [Figs. 5 and 7(b) ], this linker accommodates on top of the TIR domain, but even if it was somewhat detached from it, that would alternatively cause pI329L to mainly superpose over the linker. Since (as mentioned in the previous subsection) the linker bares several residues required for TLR3-induced activation of two key transcription factors (NFjB and IRF3), the very same that are inhibited by I329L expression, our proposed model still holds.",

In short, I-TASSER generates full length models of proteins by excising continuous fragments from Local Meta-Threading-Server multiple-threading alignments and then reassembling them using replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations (for more details see Ref. 12 and references within). It followed a more accurate modeling with Modeller using the I-TASSER results as starting input and an additional template (vide supra the modeling of pI329L) that resulted from a targeted PDB-search. 19 The quality of the models was assessed using PROCHECK v.3.4.3. 20 The best quality modeled structures were regularized and MD-relaxed using the NAMD program 21 with the CHARMM22 force-field. 22 The possible impact of I329L on TRIF signaling was further investigated through a Luciferase reporter gene assay.

            "text": "The proposed fold and structural model of the pI329L viral protein was devised using both automatic tools and human expertise in template-based modeling, along with experimental guidance. One such strategy has been proven adequate, when only remote relationships between the target and the structural templates exist. 23 Special attention has been paid in choosing the appropriate alignment(s) and template(s). The working hypothesis being that the viral protein is an antagonist of the TLR3, for which no experimental structure of its TIR-domain exist, a model of this domain in the context of the TLR3-dsRNA recognition complex was first assembled. It provided a background framework for the subsequent comparative modeling of the pI329L cytoplasmic domain. The modeling results substantiate the idea that pI329L may function as a TLR3 decoy, showing that the viral protein could hinder TLR3 dimerization, and in doing so, inhibit the downstream signaling pathway. In conjunction with the experimental evidence, the present modeling exercise allowed us to gain further insight into the strategies used by the ASF-virus to evade the host immune response and the role of the nonassigned I329L gene encoded viral protein in this process. Modeled structures are available on request. ",

The two disulfide (SS) bridges were assigned on proximity criteria. A threedimensional (3D)-superposition line indicates that two regions that are distant in terms of sequence alignment fall on top of each-other when the 3D-structures are superposed. An ''anti'' superposition means that two b-strands superpose head-to-tail. The I-TASSER predicted secondary structure for pI329L runs on top of the alignment: rod, helix; arrow, strand; and thin line, coil.
