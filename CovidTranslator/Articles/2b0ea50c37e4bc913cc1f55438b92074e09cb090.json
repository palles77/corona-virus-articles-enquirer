Vaccine development research is rapidly taking full advantage of the advent of NGS. This review provides a concise summary of the current applications of NGS in relation to research seeking to develop vaccines for human infectious diseases, incorporating studies of both the pathogen and the host. We focus on rapidly mutating viral pathogens, which are major targets in current vaccine research. NGS is unraveling the complex dynamics of viral evolution and host responses against these viruses, thus contributing substantially to the likelihood of successful vaccine development.",

In addition, there has been a lack of understanding of how these microorganisms evolve to escape host immune responses, or conversely insufficient insight into the characteristics of protective immunity exemplified by the failure of HIV vaccines [2] . At the forefront of this conundrum are infections caused by RNA viruses, which are the most common pathogens of humans and animals, and largely have no effective vaccines available. These viruses include the high-profile epidemic pathogens, such as HIV-1, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Dengue virus, as well as endemic viruses that particularly cause morbidity and mortality among infants and aged individuals, such as norovirus and enteroviruses. In addition, emergent RNA viral pathogens are a major concern, typified by swine flu (influenza A H1N1), which arose via genetic recombination and then crossed species barriers to become pandemic in 2009 [3] .",

Haplotypes: segments of DNA or RNA sequence carrying unique alleles which are transmitted together. Metagenomics: the analysis of sequences of heterogeneous genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. Omics: refers to a field of study in biology ending in -omics, such as genomics, proteomics or metabolomics. The related suffix -ome is used to address the objects of study of such fields, such as the genome, proteome or metabolome respectively. Reverse vaccinology: a vaccine research approach based on bioinformatic analyses of pathogen genomes to predict efficiently and comprehensively antigenic sites for experimental validation.

Systems biology: a discipline that focuses on the study of systems, rather than individual biological components, which may be molecules, cells, organisms or species. Transcriptome: a term used to define the set of all RNA molecules that are produced within a cell or a population of cells. Transcriptomics: the discipline that studies RNA expression, which includes long and short RNA molecules, as well as messenger and transporter RNAs. The transcriptome is both time-and cell-specific. It encompasses all RNA transcripts that are present in the cell at one time, including any modified, spliced, edited or degraded forms (and therefore it is potentially much more complex than the transcribed portion of the genome).

The combination of specific protocols for these techniques distinguishes one available technology from another. Template preparation involves randomly breaking the DNA of interest into small fragments, which are then attached to a support such as beads in suspension, or a solid interface. Spatially separated immobilization of these template sites allows thousands to billions of sequencing reactions to be performed simultaneously in a process consisting of successive incorporation, washing and scanning operations to capture the sequence data. Second generation techniques are typically based on obtaining sequences from clonally amplified templates, whereas third generation techniques use single molecules with multiple nucleotide or probe additions [5] -both options generate technical errors.",

Examples include Heliscope by Helicos (http://www.helicosbio.com/), Ion Torrent Life Technologies (http://www.iontorrent.com/) and a real-time sequencing platform by Pacific Biosciences (http://www. pacificbiosciences.com/). Third generation techniques, based on sequencing of a single molecule of DNA or RNA, without intermediate steps between reading two segments are rapidly emerging [5] . of whole genomes or transcriptomes. Therefore, rather than focusing on individual, detailed phenomena (without a priori knowledge of their importance), NGS allows systems approaches. Today, the major applications of NGS (Box 1, Table II ) are: genome sequencing, transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq), DNA-protein binding analysis (ChIP-Seq), and histone modification (NGS-methylation) (for a comprehensive review of these technologies, see [4] ). For vaccine re-search, NGS has numerous applications ( Figure 1 ), including sequencing of host and pathogen genomes [6] and their transcriptomes [7, 8] , as well as studies of the diversity in host immune responses, in both T and B cells [9] [10] [11] . The analysis of NGS data requires complex computational and bioinformatics techniques, as these datasets carry important limiting factors; notably, limited read lengths and high technical error rates (Box 2).

This is particularly relevant as RNA viruses have a highly diverse population and it is important to distinguish low frequency variants from technical errors. For example, it is possible that with an error rate of 0.2% per base copied, more than half of the reads of a 454 run may carry at least one error (assuming an average read length of 400 bp) [55] .",

Since 2008, when the first whole human genome sequence was completed [6] , at least 30 human genomes have been completed via NGS, and more will be available with the ongoing 1000 Genome Project [12] . Similarly, the large genomes of many pathogens, including DNA viruses, bacteria and parasites have been sequenced, and new pathogens identified via metagenomics [13] , such as a new Bunyavirus sequenced from patients with unexplained fever, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia [14] . A key advantage provided by NGS in genomics is the capacity to detect low-frequency variants [15] , which are important elements in both genetic and infectious diseases research [16] (see 'NGS to study rapidly mutating viruses' below). NGS analyses have also revealed complex scenarios, with somatic gene rearrangements in host tissues or cells being far more common than expected, and copy number variations accounting for more variation between individuals than the many recognized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [12] . As a remarkable example, a comprehensive whole genome analysis revealed a catastrophic event -termed chromotripsis -occurring in at least 2-3% of all human cancers, whereby tens to hundreds of somatic genomic rearrangements occur with many genomic segments from distinct chromosomes reassembled in random order into a derivative chromosome [17] .",

To date, over 5000 miR-NAs have been identified, including approximately 800 human miRNAs.

Generally, the pipeline for NGS analysis firstly includes quality control of the NGS reads by both manual and automated checking of quality scores of sequence reads; and other filtering, including elimination of the ends of individual reads which frequently carry systematic errors. After quality control, NGS reads can be aligned to a reference genome (when available), or aligned in a de novo approach (albeit with clear consequences in terms of increased complexity and analysis time). A collection of alignment tools are available -mostly public domain with many wiki pages and web sites constantly updated with the new and existing tools (e.g., see http://SEQanswers.com/). The alignment step is followed by specific data analysis for the application in consideration. Tools are also available to handle the large NGS data files and to allow for exchange in format, which facilitates the bioinformatics analyses as well as the exchange of information (e.g., samtools http://samtools.sourceforge.net/samtools.shtml). Several recent reviews have summarized currently available tools for sequence alignment [16] , SNP calling [59] , and transcriptomic analyses [16] .",

For the latter, arduous and costly biochemical methods have traditionally been used to purify antigens from organisms grown in culture, resulting in small numbers of proteins ultimately being tested for immunogenicity, with limited account for existing evidence of naturally occurring protection against these antigens [30] . Since the end of the 20th century, new technologies have been proposed to address vaccines against other pathogens for which previous methods have failed.

Genome-wide sequencing has been utilized to detect potential antigenic sites in Group B meningococci -responsible for 50% of meningococcal sepsis and meningitis worldwide [31] . This bacterium had been refractory to vaccine development, because its capsular polysaccharide (polysialic acid) is nonimmunogenic (because it is expressed by several human tissues and hence is effectively a self-antigen to which the human immune system is tolerant). With the reverse vaccinology approach, 600 putative antigens were discovered, of which 29 were shown to induce antibodies that kill the bacterium in vitro via complement-mediated mechanisms. Today, five of these antigens have been inserted into a prototype vaccine (plus outer membrane vesicle component), which is completing phase III clinical trials [32] . Following this seminal application, many other pathogens are currently being targeted with the reverse vaccinology approach where previous technology have failed, such as Group A Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae [33] .",

For example, NGS has been applied to reveal the mutation and recombination events that permitted adaptation of 240 multidrug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae [35] . More than 700 recombination events and a total of 57 736 SNPs were identified, allowing a phylogenetic reconstruction of the origin and distribution of these strains worldwide. Similarly, application of RNA-Seq to dissect the transcriptome from processed RNA of Helicobacter pylori revealed a complex scenario with the discovery of hundreds of transcriptional start sites (as opposed to the 55 previously known) [37] . This analysis also revealed more than 60 previously unknown small noncoding RNAs, that are probably involved in regulation of RNA expression and bacterial growth.",

These sequential genetic bottleneck Review Trends in Biotechnology September 2012, Vol. 30, No. 9 events indicate that a potential vaccine strategy is to target the founder viruses.

In the context of a live-attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239Dnef) vaccine administered to macaques, NGS was used to study the kinetics of occurrence of escape variants, in parallel with the evolution of the TCR b-chain repertoire specific for the wild-type epitope (Mamu-A*01 restricted Tat 28-35 SL8) [10] . In this interesting application of NGS to host-pathogen evolution, escape variants occurred at frequencies as low as 1% in the first 2 weeks post-vaccination, and these variants decayed rapidly in frequency over the first 8 weeks post-vaccination.

These vaccines generate broad cross-reactive responses against common epitopes (see [33] for a review on reverse vaccinology strategies) and therefore offer potential for broad global application. NGS also provides an efficient tool for surveillance of the ongoing evolution of important pathogens. This is exemplified by influenza infection, for which new vaccines have to be designed annually to account for continuing viral diversity (drift), as well as screening for major changes (shift) in incident strains potentially associated with pandemics. New influenza vaccine design therefore necessitates prompt decisions, and rapid implementation in both vaccine manufacture and field application to contain new pandemic threats [51] .",

This contrasts with standard approaches such as PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) screening, which are less sensitive and limited to detection of recognized mutations. Similarly, using eight live-attenuated viral vaccines (trivalent oral poliovirus, rubella, measles, yellow fever, varicella-zoster, multivalent measles/ mumps/rubella, and two rotavirus vaccines), NGS analyses have revealed minor unknown variants, as well as sequences of other viruses from the producer avian and primate tissue culture cells [54] .",

However, there are at least three key issues for resolution in wide-scale application of NGS to vaccine research. First, the quality of NGS data must be improved by resolution of technical errors [4] (see Box 2). This may extend the current spectrum of NGS applications to the detection of more complex genetic rearrangements, such as insertion, deletion and recombination events in rapidly mutating pathogen genomes [55] . Second, in an era when vaccine research is increasingly acquiring a systems biology approach, NGS in combination with large scale and high-throughput technologies to study proteomes, such as mass spectrometry, flow cytometry (and combinations of these, such as mass cytometry that allows simultaneous measurement of >30 parameters from a single cell [56] ), will provide a simultaneous, rapid, and low cost flow of integrated information on genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of both host and pathogen. In this scenario, computational analyses will need to be integrated into the workflow; not simply in analysis of the data, but rather as in integrated component of the study design. Finally, future developments in NGS will bring forward new challenges. For instance, single molecule third generation sequencing will probably remove the constraint of short reads, but will introduce other obstacles, such as new technical errors and challenges in experimental design.",

Applications of NGS for vaccine studies range from systematic analyses of many samples collected from human populations, to detailed longitudinal studies of host-pathogen interactions within fewer subjects. NGS allows rapid assessment of both human and pathogen genomes, their transcriptomes, as well as examination of host immune responses, such as T and B cell diversity. NGS can be used to assess the quality of vaccine stocks, the diversity of HLA polymorphisms in large populations, and also for detection of new pathogenic strains in mixed samples.",

(a) Phylogenetic analysis of the within-host evolution of HCV via reconstructed haplotypes of the envelope region of the genome reconstructed from NGS reads. Sequence analyses of one subject (designated 240_Ch) who ultimately developed chronic infection, revealed that the viral population found in the acute phase of the infection (aquamarine and blue, see Time legend) became markedly reduced in diversity around 100 days post-infection, before a new viral population emerged from variants that survived the genetic bottleneck event (reduction in genetic diversity) replacing the single founder virus and its progeny. Colors are also used to portray the sampling time point (see legend). This new genetically distinct viral population (gray and red in the color legend) dominated the chronic phase of infection. The size of the circles represents the prevalence of the individual variant within the viral population. (b) Kinetics of changes in viral load, and the relative contribution of individual viral variant over time are portrayed. The y axis shows the contribution of each variant with respect to the total viral RNA level.",
