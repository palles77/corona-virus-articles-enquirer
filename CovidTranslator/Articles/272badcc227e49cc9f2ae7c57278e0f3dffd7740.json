Designated as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Co), the new emerging disease dissemination was also detected in North America, Europe and Canada, and remains confined to some areas. Brazilian Public Health Authorities established a rigorous surveillance schedule in order to monitor imported cases among international travelers arriving from areas with community transmission. The Respiratory Virus Laboratory of the Adolfo Lutz Institute received 16 respiratory samples from patients arriving in S\u00e3o Paulo from Japan, Hong Kong, Pequiem, Taiwan, Europe and Canada with febrile respiratory illness.",

Isolated viruses were identified as influenza of type A by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies of the Respiratory Panel 1 Viral Screening and Identification Kit, (Chemicon Internantional). Following the subtype characterization by the hemagglutination inhibition test, antiserum provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used. Isolated viruses were sent to the Influenza Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-Atlanta, GA-for further antigenic and genetic analysis. Influenza viruses were isolated in the respiratory secretions from four patients with recent travel history to Hong Kong, Pequiem, Europe and Taiwan, respectively. Three isolated viruses were characterized as A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and one as A/New Caledonia/ 20/99 (H1N2). Among them, a mixed infection with influenza virus of type B from a 71year-old woman from Taiwan was observed. In addition, further studies are currently being completed to help characterize a virus isolated from Canada of a suspected case and a microorganism distinguished from a virus, which has been isolated from four suspected cases of SARS.",
