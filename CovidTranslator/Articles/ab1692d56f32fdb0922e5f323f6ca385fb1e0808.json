In this report, we present the first evidence of host range expansion in a virophage. We demonstrated that the Guarani virophage was able to spontaneously expand its viral host range to replicate with two novel giant viruses that were previously nonpermissive to this virophage. We were able to characterize a potential genetic determinant of this cross-species infection. We then highlighted the relevant impact of this host adaptation on giant viruses and protists by demonstrating that coinfection with the mutant virophage abolishes giant virus production and rescues the host cell population from lysis. The results of our study help to elucidate the parasitic lifestyle of virophages and their interactions with giant viruses and protists. author/funder. All rights reserved.

This phenomenon is known as host range expansion and requires the selection of specific mutations that enable a given viral species to replicate in a novel host 3 . In bacteriophages, such host range mutations target mostly the genes encoding the viral tail and baseplate involved in attachment to a receptor at the host cell surface 4, 5 .",

Although the MIMIVIRE mechanism of action is still controversial 14 , the host range of Zamilon has been efficiently expanded to mimiviruses of lineage A by silencing the MIMIVIRE genes 13 and, more recently, by knocking out the putative canonical gene of the system using homologous recombination 15 . The MIMIVIRE system has also been successfully tested in bacteria, restoring susceptibility to antibiotics through the transformation of bacteria with plasmids containing trcg targeting antibioticresistance genes 16 . Nevertheless, host range expansion mediated by spontaneous mutations has never been described in virophages. Moreover, to date, Sputnik, Zamilon and other virophages were almost exclusively challenged with mimiviruses from the three lineages, A-C, but not with distant mimivirus relatives. The only virophage tested with a distant mimivirus was Mavirus. Mavirus replicates only in the marine flagellate Cafeteria roenbergensis coinfected with a distant mimivirus named CroV 17 . Moreover, once this virus begins to replicate, it has been shown that Mavirus acts as an agent of adaptive immunity that protects its host cells from CroV infection 18, 19 .",

Such a decrease was not observed in the control (Fig. 4b) . These results are intriguing given the high replication efficiency of the mutant genotype observed with Tupanvirus Deep Ocean (Fig. 2a) . At the same time, we noticed a progressive increase in the host cell population survival over the passages (data not shown). This probably raises questions regarding the virulence of the mutant genotype toward its new virus host, Tupanvirus. Indeed, it is known from our previous study that Guarani impaired the infectivity of its viral host APMV, resulting in a decrease in amoebae lysis 24 . Nevertheless, as this is the first time that we describe a host range expanding mutation in virophage, we expected the mutant genotype to have a distinct virulent profile toward its novel virus host than the wild-type strain toward APMV. To test this hypothesis, we first started by studying the evolution of Tupanvirus infectious particle production during a passage experiment in the presence of mutant Guarani. Figure 4c shows Tupanvirus titers during a ten-passage experiment in the presence of the virophage measured by end-point dilution method. Prior to end point dilution, the virus supernatant was submitted to heat treatment at 55\u00b0C for 30 min 34 . This treatment efficiently inactivated the mutant virophage without reducing the titer of viable virus particles ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). We found that infection with the mutant strain severely modifies the trajectory of Tupanvirus in the model.",

Figure 5a shows that mutant Guarani decreases the replication of Tupanvirus DNA by approximately 3-fold. This low inhibition rate appears relatively similar to what has been found between the wild-type strain and APMV 24 . Experimental studies supported by bioinformatic analyses have shown that in contrast to their virus hosts, virophages become active during a late phase of giant virus infection 17, 24, 35 . Since genome replication is an early step in the cycle of giant viruses, this property may allow them to anticipate virophage parasitism and produce some genomic copies. We then tested the effect on the production of viable particles by quantifying the titer of Tupanvirus from 0 h to 72 h p.i. Our results reveal that mutant Guarani induces a severe decrease in the production of Tupanvirus virions during the virus cycle (Fig. 5b) . We found that in the absence of virophage, the virus was able to increase its titer by up to 500-fold during a one-step growth curve in amoebae. In contrast, infection with the mutant genotype prevented any increase in the virus titer. This inhibition is significantly far higher than that of the wild-type toward APMV 24 , but at 48 h p.i., we still were able to detect the production of infectious virions by end point dilution.",

First, at 9 h p.i., 5x10 5 cells were collected to check the impact of Guarani on ribosomal shutdown. We found that in contrast to the controls, irrespective of mutant Guarani infection, Tupanvirus was able to induce a severe shutdown in host ribosomal RNA abundance (Fig. 9a) . We then measured the replication of each virophage by qPCR and calculated their DNA amount increase using the delta Ct method considering times 0 and 48 p.i.

We found that despite this deletion, the virophage was still able to replicate with its previous virus hosts without any fitness change (Fig. 3c) . One might suppose that this replication has been observed because of the presence of a background of wild-type virophage. However, almost pure mutant Guarani (isolated from passage 5 with Tupanvirus as shown in Fig. 4a) Therefore, it is possible that the mutant genotype was already present in the Guarani population that seemed not able to replicate with Tupanvirus. However, its concentration was probably under the limit of detection of our systems. Then, Tupanvirus allowed the selection of the mutant in coinfected cells. The presence of a very low amount of the mutant virophage after the first passage with Tupanvirus probably supports this hypothesis (Fig. 4a, arrow) .",

In all these viruses, the deletion concerned sequences of several kilobase pairs (kbp) in length located around each end of the virus genomes. The ends of the genomes of these viruses seem to be highly recombinogenic in contrast to the central region, which is more subjected to selective pressures because it contains conserved core genes 43 . For ASFV, the deletion was associated with an enhancement in the capacity of the virus to replicate in Vero cells 45 . For Mimivirus, the loss of genes affected genes encoding fibers and ankyrin repeat-containing proteins. This genetic variation has given rise to a new subpopulation of viruses lacking surface fibers that were resistant to virophage 43 . Spontaneous in-frame deletions have also been reported for several other viruses, including influenza virus, photosynthetic cyanophages and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).",

Indeed, collagen-like motifs play a potential role in the attachment of phages to target bacteria. These motifs have been described in tail fiber proteins of several bacteriophages, and it is known from previous studies that mutations in this region are a crucial step in determining the acquisition of new hosts for these viruses 50, 51 . On the other hand, collagen-like repeats have also been suggested to represent recombination hotspots for bacteriophages 50 . Interestingly, a spontaneous deletion of a region containing a collagen-like repeat has been described for the temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage phi SFi21 after serial passage in bacteria. The mutant phage was remarkably unable to lysogenize its host cells 52 . It is tempting to link these observations to the study of Desnues et al 53 . The authors found that in Sputnik 2, the collagenlike gene also plays a role in recombination spot that allows the virophage to integrate itself into the Lentillevirus genome as provirophage. Therefore, the deletion in ORF8 could also involve a process of integrating Guarani into the genome of Tupanvirus that could allow the virophage to replicate. However, an experimental setting to confirm such a hypothesis is challenging and is not currently possible to set up. However, these data allow us to propose that the collagen-like gene contributes to the flexible gene content of virophages, giving them an advantage in their host-parasite interaction with giant viruses.",

The replication of each virophage was then assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) at 0, 24 hours (h) and 48 h postinfection (p.i.). Finally, the increase in the amount of virophage DNA was calculated using the delta Ct method considering time points 0 and 48 h p.i.

We therefore reduced the MOI of Tupanvirus from 0.01 to 1 and performed a dose-response experiment to virophage(Fig. 7). To improve the infection rate with virophage prior to coinfection, the virophage was incubated with Tupanvirus for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C to allow the formation of giant virus-virophage-composite. Indeed, Sputnik-like virophages are thought to enter their host cell simultaneously with their associated giant virus, attaching to its capsid fibrils38,39 .Figure 7a demonstrates that regardless of the MOI of Tupanvirus, higher virophage concentrations systematically reduced the titer of Tupanvirus to undetectable levels. In parallel with this result, Zamilon was not able to cause such inhibition for Tupanvirus (Fig. 7b), and simultaneous production of virophage and giant virus progenies was observed in coinfected cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). On the other hand, although mutant Guarani has caused a decrease in APMV titer, increasing MOI of this virophage was not able to completely prevent the propagation of the virus. These results confirm that Tupanvirus was unable to establish a productive infection in host cells that are simultaneously coinfected by the mutant genotype of Guarani. Host cell population survives Tupanvirus infection in the presence of the step was to investigate how the mutant Guarani could manipulate the stability of the host cell population. To this end, A. castellanii cells in PYG (Peptone, Yeast extract, Glucose) medium were simultaneously inoculated with Tupanvirus at several MOIs (from 0.01 to 1) and mutant Guarani at high MOI (MOI= 10). The concentration of the host cell population was then monitored by microscopy count from 0 h to 96 h p.i. In the absence of Guarani, Tupanvirus infection led to a dynamic decrease in cell density until causing a total cell lysis at 96 h approximatively (Fig. 8). Interestingly, at low MOIs of Tupanvirus (0.1 and 0.01), coinfection with Guarani was able to stop the propagation of the virus and thus rescued the host cell population from lysis (Fig. 8). Even in the presence of the virophage, we observed a cytopathic effect (rounded cells) and detected cell lysis with Tupanvirus at an MOI of 1. This finding may be observed because infection by Tupanvirus inevitably causes cell lysis, even when no virions could be produced. This observation is similar to what has been described for CroV18 . However, by reducing the virus MOI, we observed that neighboring cells did not seem to be affected after lysis of infected cells, most likely because the virophage was able to efficiently neutralize the virus in coinfected cells.",

Moreover, we have no evidence regarding the viability of wild-type virions present in the virophage after coinfection with Tupanvirus. We also demonstrated that repeated passages in the presence of Tupanvirus promoted propagation of the mutant genotype. These results provide evidence that this deletion mutation was the primary, but possibly not exclusive, determinant of host range expansion of Guarani. The first question concerns the origin of this deletion. While both Illumina sequencing and PCR failed to detect the mutant genotype in the initial isolate of the virophage, several studies have shown that host range mutations usually exist in the viral population before contact with the new host as part of the virus's genetic diversity 3,42 .",

This finding, as well as the findings of previous studies, supports the hypothesis of a protective role of virophages toward their host cells. Indeed, Fischer et al. found that the virophage Mavirus has the ability to integrate its genome into that of C. roenbergensis cells and remains latent. Superinfection with the giant CroV triggers the expression of the provirophage, enabling virophage replication. Mavirus then acts as an efficient inhibitor of CroV by preventing its spread in neighboring cells",

Overall, this observation and that of Fischer et al., with integration of Mavirus (the predator of the predator) to C. roenbergensis (the prey), shows that interrelations in nature between these microorganisms are more complex than the extended Lotka-Volterra model of host-Organic Lake phycodnavirus (OLPV)-Organic Lake virophage (OLV) population dynamics proposed by Yau et al 55 . Our results also indicate that the only way for Tupanvirus to survive virophage infection is to trigger its cytotoxic profile. This effect requires a high MOI for host organisms, and we have no evidence about the existence of such MOIs in nature. Overall, this observation and the data presented above allows us to present a new model of giant virusvirophage interaction (Fig. 10) in which the same giant virus could behave differently to virophage infection according to different parameters related to the standing genetic diversity of virophages but also to its concentration in the ecosystem. To the best of our knowledge, our study was the first to provide evidence of virophage abilities to expand their host range to infect new giant viruses. This study also highlighted a relevant impact of this host adaptation on giant virus and virophage replication and on lysis of their host cells. Thus, our results help to elucidate the parasitic lifestyle of virophages and their ecological influence on giant virus and protist populations. at an MOI of 0.02 and incubated at 30\u00b0C.

Supplementary Figure 2: Selective inactivation of the mutant virophage using heat treatment at 55 \u00b0C for 30 min. (a) The supernatant collected from passage 2 with Tupanvirus was filtered through a 0.22-\u00b5m-pore filter to remove giant virus particles. The obtained supernatant was then serially diluted from 10 -1 to 10 -5 . Each dilution was then submitted to heat treatment and subsequently used to coinfect A. castellanii cells simultaneously inoculated with Tupanvirus Deep Ocean. The virophage did not replicate in all conditions, indicating that heat treatment successively inactivated it. (b) Different concentrations of Tupanvirus Deep Ocean were submitted to heat treatment and then titrated using end point dilution. We did not observe any change in the titer of viable particles after the treatment. (c) A. castellanii cells were inoculated with Tupanvirus at an MOI of 1 and mutant Guarani at an MOI of 10. Prior to coinfection, virus-virophage suspensions were mixed, incubated to allow composite formation and then submitted to heat treatment. After lysis, the titer of infectious particles was measured by end point dilution. Heat treatment completely prevented virophage inhibition and allowed Tupanvirus to replicate.

Supplementary Figure 4: Detection of deletion of the 81-nucleotide sequence in Sputnik virophage by PCR. To detect the mutation in Sputnik, the virophage was propagated with APMV and purified as described above. Sputnik DNA was extracted from the purified virophage. Five nanograms of Sputnik DNA were then used as a template for PCR. Sanger sequencing on each band confirmed the mutation. The primers used for PCR and Sanger sequencing are the same as Guarani. Supplementary Figure 5: Effect of conservation on mutant Guarani virion viability. The virophage was isolated from Tupanvirus supernatant (passage 2) and then incubated at room temperature for 2 months or conserved at 4\u00b0C for 5 months, approximatively. Virophage ability to replicate with Tupanvirus was then assessed by real-time PCR as described above. The virophage did not replicate in either condition. The virophage survived other incubation times (15 days and 1 month at room temperature and 2 months at 4\u00b0C, data not shown).
