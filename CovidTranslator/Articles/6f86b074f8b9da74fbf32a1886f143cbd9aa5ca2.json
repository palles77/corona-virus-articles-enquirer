Briefly, the mild type was defined as \"having malaise only without positive chest radiologic findings\"; the moderate type was defined as \"having common respiratory infection symptoms such as fever, cough and positive chest radiologic changes\"; the severe type was determined if any of the following conditions existed, including dyspnea (respiratory rate \u2265 30 per minute), low finger oxygen saturation (\u226493% at rest), low PaO2/FiO2 (\u2264 300mmHg) or rapid progress of chest radiological abnormality (>50% within 24-48 hours); and the critical type was determined if respiratory failure (mechanical ventilation needed), shock or multiple organ dysfunctions was complicated.",

Unlike bacterial infections which usually invade accessory glands and epididymis, virus circulating in the blood mainly attack testis. It is known that a broad range of virus families, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), mumps virus, influenza, Zika virus, CoxsacKie virus, may induce orchitis and even result in male infertility [14] . Besides, many viruses such as Ebola, HIV, Zika and Hepatitis virus B/C can be transmitted into semen and cause sexual transmission. The deleterious effects of viruses involve the direct damage of spermatozoon, abnormal sex-hormone secretion, and dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines. For example, a study based on rams showed that bluetongue virus can replicate in the endothelial cells of the peritubular areas within the testes, leading to enhanced type-I interferon response, decreased testosterone biosynthesis by Leydig cells, and even destruction of Sertoli cells [15] .",

The interstitial Leydig cells are responsible for testosterone production under regulation of LH. It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 and the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for entry into host cells [6] . Based on scRNA-seq analysis, Wang ZP et al. found that TMPRSS2 mainly exists in spermatogonia and spermatids, whereas ACE2 widely expresses in spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis further indicated that GO categories associated with viral reproduction and transmission were positively enriched in ACE2-positive spermatogonia [9] .

Although serum testosterone levels did not statistically change in the COVID-19 group, a significant increase in serum LH level and a dramatic decrease in serum T: LH were observed. In interpreting those results, the following points should be taken into account: (1) As known, there is a subtle negative feedback between T in testes and LH in pituitary.
