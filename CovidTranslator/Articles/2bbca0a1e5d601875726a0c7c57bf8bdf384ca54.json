Pregnant women are at higher risk of developing pneumonia from viruses, like the flu virus as an example. The limited early data shows that pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia are at higher risks of being intubated and critically ill (about 8%), and having complications such as miscarriage, preterm birth (41%), preeclampsia (14%), cesarean (91%), and their babies of stillbirth (2.4%), admission to the intensive care unit (8%), and neonatal death.2 While no maternal deaths have been reported in the world so far (3/21/2020), the first ones are happening even today in the US. Pregnancy should be considered a co-morbidity, and pregnant women may be at higher risk of complications from COVID-19.",

In Italy alone -a country with 1/5 the population of the US, currently (data from 3/20/2020), hundreds of physicians are dead and >3,000 seriously ill from COVID-10. This is in spite of lock-down (only essential workers as those in healthcare, pharmacists, and food stores) for 2 weeks.",

Healthcare workers need to be the population most protected now. Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks as well as N-95 masks or equivalent should be prioritized by the fed and individual states for healthcare workers. At Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, it is now mandatory that all obstetrical heathcare workers coming in direct contact with patients wear PPE, both in the outpatient and inpatient (e.g. L&D) setting. While other specialties can drastically decrease provider-patient in-person outpatient and even inpatient (e.g. elective surgeries) interactions, obstetrics is one specialty (with perhaps only surgical oncology as exception) which cannot avoid these direct interpersonal interactions, as births cannot be postponed.",

The police, and if necessary the military, should be empowered to strictly enforce the lockdown, with severe consequences for those not following these rules.",
