CoVs have a single-strand positive sense RNA genome and consist of four groups: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Table 1) . Viral entry into cells is highly dependent on the interaction between viral particles and the host cells. CoVs use a variety of cellular receptors and co-receptors, including proteins and sugars, to facilitate their entry into cells. Infection begins with an interaction between the virus and its specific receptors (Li, 2015) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) of group beta uses a type I integral membrane protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a receptor . There is no structural homology between SARS-CoV and the Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) receptor-binding domain (RBD), but they recognize the same receptor, ACE2 (Wu et al., 2011) . Although the RBD crystal structures of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and HCoV-NL63 are similar, they use different receptors (Reguera et al., 2012) . Aminopeptidase N (APN), also known as CD13, is a type II transmembrane protein (Tusell et al., 2007) . TGEV and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infect cells through interaction with porcine (p) APN (Li et al., 2007; Nam and Lee, 2010) . Human (h) APN is a receptor for HCoV-229E (Belouzard et al., 2012) . In the same beta group, the receptors for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) and a sugar, respectively, despite their high sequence homology Peng et al., 2012) . CEACAM1, the first identified coronavirus receptor (Dveksler et al., 1991) , is a type I transmembrane multifunctional protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily (de Haan et al., 2005) .",

All CoV S share the same functional component in two domains: an Nterminal domain called S1 that is responsible for receptor binding, and a C-terminal S2 domain that is responsible for fusion. S1 contains two subdomains, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain ( Figure 1A ). Both function as RBDs and bind a variety of proteins and sugars (Belouzard et al., 2012) .",
