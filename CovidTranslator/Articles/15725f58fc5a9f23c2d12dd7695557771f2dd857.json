Our findings showed that the level of activity on Weibo corresponded with the number of new cases reported. In addition, the reporting of new cases on Weibo was significantly faster than those of conventional reporting sites and non-local news media. A qualitative review of the functions of Weibo also revealed that Weibo enabled timely monitoring of other outbreak-relevant information, provided access to additional crowd-sourced epidemiological information and was leveraged by the local government as an interactive platform for risk communication and monitoring public sentiment on the policy response. Our analysis demonstrated the potential for social networking sites to be used by public health agencies to enhance traditional communicable disease surveillance systems for the global surveillance of overseas public health threats.

Most human cases of A(H7N9) infection were severe and were characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 2 There was significant international concern about the impact of this novel infection on global health and security. 3, 4 In Singapore, to follow the rapidly evolving A(H7N9) outbreak in China, we supplemented information obtained from conventional public health information channels with posts from Sina Weibo (www.weibo.com; Weibo). Weibo is a popular social networking site in China with more than 500 million registered users as of February 2013. It was one of the fastest social networking platforms to report breaking news on A(H7N9) and was leveraged by health authorities, media and the public to monitor outbreak-related information. 5",

The volume of social media discussion corresponded to the number of reported cases (Figure 1) . The increasing number of cases from 10 April onward was accompanied by a surge in the number of posts, indicative of the public's heightened awareness of the disease while the outbreak appeared to be gaining momentum. A peak of 48 255 daily posts was recorded on 16 April when the highest daily number of 16 cases was reported. Weibo users' interest in A(H7N9) plummeted briefly on 21 April and 24 April, probably due to a shift in attention toward other major National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC); the Event Information Site of the World Health Organization (WHO) and email alerts from a leading international news agency, Agence France-Presse (AFP). The second data set included Weibo posts containing the search phrase \"H7N9\". We obtained the Weibo data set from an authorized provider. To ensure data quality and reduce data noise, we solicited posts from authenticated users whose identities had been verified by Weibo. We focused our analysis period from 31 March to 30 April 2013 for two reasons: (1) the outbreak started on 31 March and the majority of cases during the first wave of the outbreak were recorded in April (126 cases of the total of 133); (2) daily reporting of cases by the NHFPC website was only available during the first wave.",

Weibo posts that were the first to report the 126 cases were retrieved, and information including time of reporting, reporter account and epidemiological information of the cases was recorded. To identify the timeliest reporter of each case, we used the advanced search function of Weibo. Key phrase \"h7n9\" was used, and the search was restricted to authenticated users. Time duration was narrowed down to only one hour to allow retrieval of all posts as Weibo tends to automatically exclude posts if the volume is too large. The location of posts was left unspecified. The search results were compared against the line listing of cases confirmed by WHO to identify the earliest reporter. The Weibo users with the timeliest report on new cases comprised province/municipality-based news agencies, including Zhejiang Daily (the official newspaper of Zhejiang provincial government), Modern Express and China Exclusive (both belong to Xinhua News Agency, the official news agency of the Chinese central government) ( Table 1 ). The veracity of the data reported from these users is likely to be high, and this was confirmed when manual verification of the information from these posts and those from official reports showed high level of concurrence. Upon release of information by the provincial/municipal health authorities, these news agencies posted the news on their Weibo account immediately, before reporting on their conventional websites. In contrast, announcement at the NHFPC website typically lagged behind and was probably due to the additional time taken to collate information from the various provincial/municipal health authorities for the Chinese central government's daily updates.",

Reporting of new cases on Weibo was an average of 1 hour 2 minutes before the NHFPC website with a maximum lead time of 20 hours and 35 minutes. This lead was even greater when Weibo reporting was compared with that of AFP with the latter reporting an average of 8 hours and 14 minutes after the NHPFC. The average lead was more pronounced when compared to WHO that reported cases an average of 23 hours and 13 minutes after the NHPFC (Figure 2) . The delay in the announcement by WHO was expected as WHO reports only cases that are notified to them by Member States (China in this case) in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005). 6 In addition, further time lag would be incurred if clarification or confirmatory testing of the cases were required. Weibo was also used by the Chinese health authorities as a tool for assessing public sentiments to proposed outbreak response measures to guide policy decisions. In April 2013, a local news media conducted a survey on Weibo to seek citizens' views on permanent closure of live poultry markets (LPMs) in Shanghai. 7 A total of 28.6% of the respondents supported permanent closure, while 30.4% opposed the idea. Among all the outbreak-relevant information. On 24 April, WHO held a press conference on its investigation findings in China; the transcript was posted in real-time on the NHFPC's Weibo feed, allowing instant access to the information from anywhere in the world.",

Time is usually required to monitor the information put out by various users and to compare them against verified reports to insure their relevance for inclusion into the surveillance system. The other limitation is the veracity of the information. While the analyses of posts could be limited to those from verified users only, we observed that the study of posts from layman users provided an understanding of the actual situation and sentiments in the affected country. This additional viewpoint could have a significant impact on outbreak control and consequently influence the risk assessment of the outbreak.

The findings of our analysis demonstrate the potential for public health agencies to acquire time-sensitive information on rapidly evolving outbreaks occurring outside of their countries through social networking sites. In our analysis, Weibo served as a platform leveraged by central/provincial governments, local news agencies and the public for the timely release and retrieval of information. The Chinese social networking sites' timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official websites of the central Chinese government and WHO. Information was released by the local news agencies on the social networking site in the local language before any reports in the conventional news websites or government websites. The information was subsequently amplified by the social networking sites through re-posting of the original report. This allowed the international community greater access to more detailed and timely information compared to that released at the central government level to the international media. The central Chinese government may have allowed the provincial/municipal health authorities to release information on new cases when available to ensure transparency and timeliness of public communications. The access to such timely, crowd-sourced information on infected cases greatly facilitated the understanding of the epidemiology of an unknown disease, which is key in developing effective prevention and control measures. public health practitioners, social media surveillance could provide early warning for unusual public health events in a foreign country and serve as an additional source of epidemiological intelligence to complement conventional surveillance tools. For local public health authorities, social media surveillance could function as an effective platform for public education and social mobilization. The underlying value coupled with the challenges of using social media warrants future research and collaboration between public health agencies and computational scientists to enhance its use in disease outbreak surveillance and response.",

Constant monitoring and real-time analysis of a large influx of data with a high level of background noise, including rumours and unrelated information, is labour-intensive. Identifying the most appropriate social media platform to use is also critical to ensure effectiveness. In this case, the use of Weibo for the A(H7N9) outbreak in China would be more appropriate than global social media platforms such as Twitter. Language barriers can pose additional challenges; our ability to access and accurately interpret information from Weibo was partly due to our being based in Singapore where Mandarin is an official language.
