A possible person-to-person spread was identified when a cluster of 2019-nCoV patients with Wuhan traveling records emerged in more cities in China Huang et al., 2020) . By Feb 2 of 2020, 11,901 cases were laboratory confirmed and 259 died (National Health Commission Update on February 02, 2020, http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/ 202002/d5c495da742f4739b7f99339c3bd032f.shtml). All patients had the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). The novel coronavirus belongs to lineage B of the genus betacoronavirus of the Coronavirus family, which includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Zhu et al., 2020) . The 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans (Chan et al., 2020) . A recent study reported that fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue were common symptoms, and sputum production, headache, haemoptysis, and diarrhea were less common symptoms . All patients had pneumonia and about half developed dyspnea. One third of the patients were admitted to ICU . Compared with the 10% fatal rate of SARS-CoV (Jiang et al., 2005) and 37% fatal rate of MERS-CoV (Niu et al., 2018) , 2019-nCoV is now the third lethal virus in the coronavirus family.",

Of these patients, seven patients were over 60 years old. Notably, one adolescent case (case 7, 10 years old) was also found. Except for case 5 who lived in Shenzhen, 11 cases (91.7%) lived or traveled to Wuhan city, and two family clusters were identified. Cases 1, 2, 6, and 7 within one family stayed in a hotel at a distance of about 2.5 miles away from Huanan Seafood Market for 6 days. On Dec 31, 2019 and Jan 1, 2020, they went to two local households for dinner. Cases 1, 2, and 6 developed fever on Jan 1, 2020, and case 6 also developed diarrhea. On Jan 4, 2020, they returned to Shenzhen city ( Figure 1 ) where they lived with case 5, who subsequently developed fever, cough, and myalgia on Jan 8, 2020. Of note, none of the family members had an exposure history to indicate direct contact with seafood, live poultry, or other wild animals. Cases 10 and 11 were a couple who lived about 5.5 miles away from Huanan Seafood Market. They developed symptoms with fever and cough on Jan 4, 2020, and went to Shenzhen on Jan 13, 2020 ( Figure  1 ). According to the possible exposure histories of the 12 patients, the estimated incubation period ranged from 1 to 13 days. Most of the cases developed influenza-like symptoms, and the intervals between illness onset and admission were between 5 and 16 days (Table 1) . Six (50%) cases had underlying diseases, including chronic heart disease, renal diseases, and diabetes. Pneumonia was the most common applications, followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (including two cases with severe ARDS). All the patients received anti-viral (Ribavirin and Interferon) treatments, and six of them required mechanical ventilation, among whom cases 2, 4, and 10 received invasive mechanical ventilation. Corticosteroids and immunoglobulin were also used in cases 2, 4, and 10 ( Table 1) .",

The chest computed tomography (CT) scans of all patients showed ground-glass opacity around the shadow and pleural effusion, especially the lower and peripheral parts of the lungs (Figure 2 ; Figure S1 in Supporting Information). During the progression of the disease, the density of ground-glass opacity increased, and the range became larger, diffusing to the center and finally throughout the lungs (Figure 2 ). Case 4 developed fulminant myocarditis 5 days after illness onset. The biochemistry indexes associated with the function of heart, i.e., creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin (MYO), cardiac troponin 1 (Ctn1), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and CK myocardial band (CK-MB), were significantly elevated in case 4 (Table 2) , and ultrasonic cardiogram results showed that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 32%, and the left ventricular diameter (LV) was 61 mm on Jan 15, 2020 (5 days after illness onset) ( Figure S2 in Supporting Information).",

The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patients highly correlated with both ARDS index PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and lung injury Murray score, but not with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) score APACHE II ( Figure 3A ; Figure S3 in Supporting Information). This finding is consistent with the clinical features in this report that half of the infected patients developed ARDS and all patients were diagnosed with pneumonia, indicating that lung failure of the infected patients is the major dysfunction caused by 2019-nCoV infection. Using the Spearman method, we further correlated the C t value (viral load) of the 2019-nCoV virus with biochemical and clinical indexes, and found that the levels of infectious diseases indicators albumin (ALB), and percentage of immunological cells of LYM, and NEU were significantly correlated with infected 2019-nCoV viral load ( Figure 3B ).",

RAS plays important roles in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis (Forrester et al., 2018) , and salt and fluid balance (Lin et al., 2017) . ACE and ACE2 play different roles in RAS; ACE generates Angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 is a negative regulator of the system, decreasing Angiotensin II (Crackower et al. 2002) . The abnormal increase of Angiotensin II was reported mostly associated with hypertension and heart failures (Packer and McMurray, 2017) , and sometimes also lung and renal dysfunctions (Fr\u00f6hlich et al., 2016; Kuba et al., 2005; 2017; Torres et al., 2014 ). We measured the plasma level of Angiotensin II from 2019-nCoV infected patients and healthy individuals, the plasma levels of Angiotensin II from 2019-nCoV infected patients were significantly higher than that of healthy individuals ( Figure 6A) . Moreover, the level of Angiotensin II in 2019-nCoV patients was strongly associated with viral load and lung injury ( Figure 6B and C), suggesting that the imbalanced renin-angiotensin system in patients was caused by 2019-nCoV and drugs of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) balancing RAS may be used repurposing on 2019-nCoV infected patients.",

            "text": "We report 12 cases with laboratory confirmed 2019-nCoV infections. All patients were admitted to the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China. All patients were either living in or traveling to Wuhan from late December of 2019 to early January of 2020, except case 5 who stayed in Shenzhen during the time period. Two family clusters were identified, and case 5 was in one of the family clusters with cases 1, 2, 6, and 7. This secondary infection of case 5 is one evidence of possible person-to-person spread of 2019-nCoV. Cases 1, 2, 6, and 7 might have been simultaneously infected in Wuhan, probably by a super-spreader contacting them in the hotel or home of their relatives, as five of their relatives in Wuhan developed similar symptoms (Chan et al., 2020) . Since case 5 had disease onset 4 days after family members returning from Wuhan, the latency of 2019-nCoV might be as short as 1-4 days while the latency of most other patients was from 7 to 13 days (Figure 1 ). Two out of the 12 patients had no diagnosis of fever, including case 7 who had a clinical image check when accompanying family members to the hospital ( Table 1 ). The risk of virus spread increased with non-fever patients, indicating that it is important to establish epidemiological history during clinical reception of the patients. All samples from the respiratory tract, including throat swabs and BALF, were collected from 10 patients. Comparing the laboratory tests of these samples, the results of throat swabs and BALF collected at the same time from case 1, 3, and 4 were not consistent (Table S1 in Supporting Information), i.e., positive in BALF and negative in throat swabs, indicating that BALF was a more reliable sample for the 2019-nCoV test. It is worth noting that the laboratory test of BALF from case 8 was negative, but positive with throat swabs. Case 8 was discharged from our hospital after one week. Further studies are necessary to elucidate whether the foundation of disease was related to the location of the virus in the respiratory tract.",

            "text": "Our study provides a list of potential predictors for disease severity. For example, our study demonstrated that ALB and LYM counts were negatively correlated with the Murray scores, while CRP and LDH levels were positively correlated with the Murray scores in patients with 2019-nCoV ( Figure  4 ). The Murray score was originally developed to assess the severity of acute lung injury in ARDS (Murray et al., 1988) , and higher scores indicate greater severity in ARDS patients. This is consistent with previous studies showing that hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, and CRP \u22654 mg dL -1 were the predictive factors for pneumonia progression to respiratory failure in MERS-CoV infected patients and elevated lactate dehydrogenase was found with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) infection on hospital admission (Ko et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2004; Leem et al., 2018) . Therefore, the combinations of the hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, and high concentrations of CRP and LDH in 2019-nCoV infected patients upon hospital admission may predict more severe acute lung injury. We discovered the markedly increased level of Angiotensin II in the plasma samples from 2019-nCoV infected patients. Our previous mice study has demonstrated that SARS-CoV could bind to its receptor ACE2, down-regulating its expressions, resulting in increased Angiotensin II level in mouse blood samples, signaling through angiotensin II receptor 1, and induced acute lung injury (Huang et al., 2014; Imai et al., 2005; Zou et al., 2014) . We have also reported that avian influenza A virus H5N1 infected mice exhibited the acute lung injury through dysregulating RAS, and markedly elevation of Angiotensin II level in H7N9 infected patients was associated with the disease severity and outcomes (Guo et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2014) . In addition, a retrospective cohort study in Texas, USA with hospitalized pneumonia patients reported that prior and inpatients use of ACE inhibitor and ARB were associated with the decreased mortality (Mortensen et al., 2012) . Our previous studies demonstrated that ARB drugs, especially losartan, could effectively ameliorate mice acute lung injury induced by Yan et al., 2015) . These data suggest that ARB drugs may be used as treatment for ICU patients infected with 2019-nCoV.",
