The infectious particles were estimated to be between 25 and 50 nm by filtration. Residual infectivity of infectious serum was 0.1 per cent after heating at 56 \u00b0 C for 4 hours. P E D V and the Stockholm agent appeared identical concerning pathogenic and immunogcnic properties by infection experiments and protection tests in rabbits. Two of the three P E D V isolates were less pathogenic but appeared immunogenically identical to PEDV. The third isolate, obtained from the laboratory, which several years previously had supplied material for demonstration of the Stoekholm agent, differed from P E D V in pathogenic and immunogenie properties.",

This was done by passaging contaminated treponemal suspensions through hamsters, which are not susceptible to PEDV, but which allow the multiplication of treponemes (2, 6) . These efforts appeared to be successful since intercurrent rabbit mortality fell to less than one per cent after 1976.

(12) also reported the association of coronavinls-like agents with intestinal infections in rabbits. Both S5~ALI~ et al. and OSTEI~I~AVS st al. detected coronavirus-like particles in infectious serum. However, in our hands no coronavirus-like particles were detected by electron microscopy in rabbits infected with P E D V (FE~NESTAD et al., unpublished results), and by filtration infectious PEDV particles were clearly smaller than infectious HCV 229E particles. The heat stability of PEDV, which is in agreement with S~AI~L et al. (19) , was greater than that reported for coronaviruses (21, 23) . SMALL et al. used a CF assay to show that antigen(s) :in infectious serum displayed a cross-reactivity with HCVs 229E and 0C43 and that hyperimmune sera from convalescent rabbits contained antibodies to HCV229E. These results are surprising as these HCVs have been shown to be antigcnically unrelated (13, t5, 23) . Our ELISAs show that P E D V does not generally produce antibodies related to HCV 229E and CV Paris. One of 20 rabbits showed a positive reaction to CV Paris, but this is probably not due to infection with PEDV, as normal rabbit sera contains antibodies to both CV Paris and HCV 0C43, but not HCV229E, indicating the existence of a possible rabbit coronavirus antigenically related to CV Paris and HCV OC43 (MAoNAuGHTO~\u00a2, unpublished results).
