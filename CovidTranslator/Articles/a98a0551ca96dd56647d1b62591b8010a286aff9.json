Infection due to these viruses is associated with multiple complications including: rhinitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, respiratory failure and even death. CARVs have also become increasingly recognized as a risk factor for acute rejection (AR) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Newer diagnostic techniques have enhanced the accuracy of diagnosis, but proven treatment options for CARVs are limited. Further insight into the immune response and allograft dysfunction associated with CARV infections is needed in order to develop novel management strategies which can reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by these infectious agents.",

Compared to pediatric patients, the yield obtained from upper respiratory tract samples in adults may be inferior due to decreased viral burden or shedding in the nasal passages [2, 11] . Analysis by BAL has been shown to improve the sensitivity of results [2] . Viral culture can also take many days for a positive result to return which delays initiation of antiviral therapy and risks transmission of illness to other immunosuppressed patients.

Several other retrospective studies, however, have supported an association between CARVs and chronic rejection [1-3, 7, 8, 11, 33, 41, 46] . A review of cohort studies by Vilchez et al. in 2003 reported that the rate of BOS following CARV infection in lung transplant recipients ranges from 32-50 % depending on the type of virus [3] . Billings et al. suggested that recipients with LRTIs due to a CARV had a relative risk of 2.3 for developing high-grade BOS and that recipients infected within the first six months post-transplant were more likely to acquire high-grade BOS [1] . Further support for an independent connection between CARV infection and BOS was published in a 2004, retrospective study by Khalifah et al. [8] . This analysis indicated that CARV infection after lung transplantation doubled the risk of developing BOS stage 1 and if it was a LRTI the risk of subsequent progression to BOS was tripled.",

Although studies evaluating the impact of CARVs on short and long term allograft function are heterogenous and have various limitations, the majority of the investigations support a direct relationship between AR and CARV infection. This also supports an association between CARV infection and BOS since AR is an established risk factor for BOS.
