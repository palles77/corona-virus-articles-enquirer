Previous studies revealed that PEDV exhibits an obvious capacity for modulating interferon (IFN) signaling or expression. The newly discovered type III IFN, which plays a crucial role in antiviral immunity, has strong antiviral activity against PEDV proliferation in IPEC-J2 cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein on type III IFN-\u03bb. We found that the N proteins of ten PEDV strains isolated between 2013 and 2017 from different local farms shared high nucleotide identities, while the N protein of the CV777 vaccine strain formed a monophyletic branch in the phylogenetic tree. The N protein of the epidemic strain could antagonize type III IFN, but not type I or type II IFN expression induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) in IPEC-J2 cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the inhibition of poly(I:C)induced IFN-\u03bb3 production by PEDV N protein was dependent on the blocking of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) nuclear translocation. These findings might help increase understanding of the pathogenesis of PEDV and its mechanisms for evading the host immune response.",

The IFN-\u03bb family in humans consists of four members (IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, IFN-\u03bb3, and IFN-\u03bb4) (Wack et al., 2015) , whereas swine expresses only IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb3 (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006; Sang et al., 2010) . Li et al. (2017) also proved that both recombinant porcine IFN-\u03bb1 (rpIFN-\u03bb1) and rpIFN-\u03bb3 exhibit robust antiviral activity against PEDV proliferation in vitro.

N protein is known to be an important IFN antagonist in many coronaviruses (Ye et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2014) . Lu et al. (2011) confirmed that the N protein of SARS-CoV dramatically inhibited the expression of IFN-\u03b2 from a nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) responsive promoter. MHC N protein was reported to play a crucial role in circumventing the innate immunoresponse by antagonizing type I IFN (Ye et al., 2007) . PEDV N protein was shown to block IFN-\u03b2 production in HEK-293T cells by targeting the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to inhibit its interaction with the critical transcription factors NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Ding et al., 2014) . Only N protein and papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) of PEDV have been demonstrated as IFN antagonists (Ding et al., 2014) . However, it remains to be determined whether the N protein of PEDV functions as an IFN-\u03bb antagonist. Therefore, in this study, we used IPEC-J2 cells to investigate the effect of PEDV N protein on the production of IFN-\u03bb to give a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the porcine host-pathogen interaction, which could help to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop effective vaccines against PEDV.",

Previous studies revealed that the N proteins of coronaviruses exhibit an obvious capacity to inhibit the production of IFN-\u03b2 in vitro (Ye et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2014) . Coronavirus N proteins, which have been reported to be involved in viral RNA replication and transcription, share similar motifs, structural features, and functions (Laude and Masters, 1995; Schelle et al., 2005) . In accordance with previous reports, our phylogenetic tree analysis found that the majority of PEDV strains recently isolated in China shared the same N amino acid identity (Fig. 1) .",

Li et al. (2017) found that IFN-\u03bb, expressed on the epithelial cells of the intestine, exhibited strong antiviral activity against PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. To investigate the effect of N protein on IFN-\u03bb, we first increased IFN production in IPEC-J2 cells by the addition of poly(I:C). The three types of IFNs, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, and IFN-\u03bb3, were notably increased after treatment with poly(I:C) as determined by qPCR. The plasmid of pcDNA3-N was subsequently transfected into IPEC-J2 cells, and the expression of N protein was detected at 24 h by Western blot and immunofluorescences assay (IFA) (Figs. 2 and 3) . The mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 in poly(I:C)-treated cells were similar to those in poly(I:C) and pcDNA3-N co-transfected cells, whereas the mRNA level of IFN-\u03bb3 was significantly reduced (P<0.05) when the N protein was expressed in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 4) . A similar trend of the IFN-\u03bb transcription level in poly(I:C) and pcDNA3-N cotransfected cells was shown by the luciferase activity assay (Fig. 5) . These data strongly indicated that the N protein of PEDV inhibited the transcription and expression of IFN-\u03bb, but not type I IFNs, in IPEC-J2 cells.",

            "text": "The type I IFN inhibitory mechanism of PEDV was extensively investigated in previous studies . However, Ding et al. (2014) found that PEDV N protein significantly inhibited the production of type I IFN in HEK 293 cells. TLR2 mediates (Cao et al., 2015a) , and PEDV N could inhibit doublestranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced type I IFN by blocking the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-mediated pathway in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from the newborn piglet ileum (Cao et al., 2015b) . One explanation for this disagreement may be the different choice of cells. IPEC-J2 cells are one Fig. 6 Nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB suppressed by PEDV nucleoprotein Cells were observed under laser confocal microscope (600 times magnified). NF-\u03baB was in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. After induction of poly(I:C), NF-\u03baB was translocated into the nuclei, but when PEDV N protein was co-expressed, the NF-\u03baB distribution returned to the same as in unstimulated cells. Cells only transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector were taken as vector control of the target porcine cell types that PEDV infects. Thus, the data collected from IPEC-J2 cells may reflect a more realistic situation of host-pathogen interaction in vivo. The mRNA level of IRF3 showed a decreasing pattern (Fig. 4) . However, due to the low levels of fold change in N-expressing cells, the mRNA level of type I IFNs was not affected by PEDV N protein. Possible explanations for this have been put forward by Zhang et al. (2015) who reported that the IRF3 mRNA level was not the only factor that can affect type I IFNs. It is necessary to determine the protein level and localization of IRF3 to investigate the mechanism of action of type I IFNs. We conducted Western blot and immunofluorescence assays on IRF3 (data not shown), but unfortunately, the commercial antibodies for human IRF3 did not work efficiently on swine cells. Because of these limitations, we focused our experiments only on the inhibitory effect of PEDV N protein on IFN-\u03bb.",

Once infected by the virus, NF-\u03baB or IRFs of epithelial cells were activated and then moved into the nuclei and up-regulated the transcription level of IFN-\u03bb (Osterlund et al., 2005; Seth et al., 2005; Odendall et al., 2014; Odendall and Kagan, 2015) . Iversen et al. (2010) found that NF-\u03baB had a significant effect on the expression of IFN-\u03bb rather than on type I IFN, suggesting that the NF-\u03baB pathway might play the dominant role in driving the IFN-\u03bb response on epithelial surfaces of the intestine. This might also explain why induction of only type III, not type I or II IFNs, was blocked in our study. However, the swine IFN-\u03bb regulation mechanism remains unknown. In accordance with this evidence, our results indicated that NF-\u03baB moved into the nuclei after the cells were treated with poly(I:C), leading to a significantly increased transcription level of IFN-\u03bb. However, NF-\u03baB failed to move into the nuclei in the PEDV N protein-expressing cells, resulting in a significant decrease in the mRNA level of IFN-\u03bb (Fig. 6) . Taken together, our study identified that PEDV N protein caused a blockade of IFN-\u03bb induction through activation of NF-\u03baB in IPEC-J2 cells. The knowledge gained from this study may assist in the development of antiviral reagents and vaccines. ",
