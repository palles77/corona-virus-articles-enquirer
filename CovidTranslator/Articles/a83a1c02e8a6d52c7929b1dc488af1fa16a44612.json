These nematodes do not usually cause overt clinical disease in affected rodents, but alterations in host physiology have been reported 3 . In live rodents, Syphacia sp. can be detected by identifying eggs on a cellophane tape impression of the host's perianal region ('tape test'), and Aspiculuris sp. can be diagnosed using fecal flotation. Postmortem diagnostic testing is considered more reliable than these methods and involves direct examination of the rodent's cecal and colon contents for adult worms. Taxonomic classification of an adult nematode can be accomplished by microscopic examination of its head and tail 3 .",

The continuous treatment schedule has been reported to be effective for eradicating Syphacia sp. 4 but has not been attempted with Aspiculuris sp. It is possible that a longer course of treatment (and associated increase in cost) would be required because of the longer prepatent period of A. tetraptera.

There are few human health concerns associated with the handling of ivermectin; nonetheless, personnel wore personal protective equipment including gowns, gloves and eye protection while diluting the compounds. Lifting the carboys to the top of the racks was a potential ergonomic problem, as the carboys weighed approximately 18 kg when filled. Our facility owns a specialized hand crank lift, however, which is regularly used to remove and replace the motors from the top of the ventilated racks. We used this lift to safely raise the carboys to the top of the shelves. The configuration of the wall-mounted ventilated caging racks allowed secure placement of the carboys without concern of them falling (Fig. 3) .",

We achieved complete elimination after 7 consecutive weeks of treatment, as confirmed by repeated sampling during the treatment period. Indirect sentinel testing, which included screening for pinworms as described above, continued on a quarterly basis. In the 15 months after the completion of treatment, no additional infections were identified, suggesting that the method of treatment we used was efficacious.",
