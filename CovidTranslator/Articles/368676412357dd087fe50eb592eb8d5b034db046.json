Friedlander and Yeh (1998) have provided supporting evidence for the involvement of peroxides in the adverse health effects of particulate pollutants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in particles also have been shown to play an important role. Highly reactive oxygen-containing species, such as hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide, are collectively described as ROS. In ambient air, photochemical reactions involving reactive organic gases can produce ROS, which are distributed in the gas and particulate phases. Combustion aerosols, such as vehicular exhaust, also contain relatively high concentrations of ROS. Hung and Wang (2001) have reported that the concentrations of particulate ROS in ambient air are strongly associated with photochemical activities. There is a good correlation between the concentrations of ambient ozone and ROS in submicron particles, especially in the ultrafine fraction that are freshly produced by either photochemical reactions in ambient air or combustion processes in vehicular engines.",

First reported in Asia in February 2003, its symptoms include high fever (temperature higher than 38.0~ shortness of breath, headache, coughing, diarrhea, and malaise. Most SARS patients develop pneumonia. According to the World Health Organization, a total of 8,098 people worldwide were infected during the 2003 outbreak. Of these, 774 died. A probable transmission route of the SARS virus is the spread of droplets produced by the cough or sneeze of a patient. Infection can occur if these droplets deposit on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby.",
