Methods: A study was conducted of 484 consecutive patients seen in the emergency department (ED) of our tertiary care center during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan. The scoring system was divided into triage and screening station stages. Data were analysed with multivariable and logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 737 patients who presented to our ED for possible SARS from March to June 2003, we enrolled 484 patients with a temperature .38.0\u02daC (.100.3\u02daF) (age .18 years). Dyspnoea, diarrhoea, travel, close contact, hospital exposure, and household history were identified as predictive indicators in the triage stage. The triage score was the total of six items. With a one-point cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity were 81.8% (18/22) and 73.6% (340/462). Leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and CXR were identified as predictive indicators in the fever screening stage. Screening station scores (the sum of 10 items) consisted of triage scores, white blood cell count, and CXR. With a three-point cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity were 95.5% (21/22) and 87.2% (403/462). Conclusions: Syndromic and traditional surveillance play a role in early identification of SARS in an endemic area. The SARS scoring system described is easily applicable and highly effective in screening patients during outbreaks.",

Since March 2003, SARS outbreaks have become a worldwide threat, especially in East South Asia during a short period. Taiwan had the third highest number of cumulative SARS cases and SARS death behind mainland China and Hong Kong. 1 Before 21 April 2003, there was no community or hospital outbreak and no SARS mortality in Taiwan. However, on 21 April, the Department of Health (DOH) in Taiwan announced that hospital transmission might have happened. From that point on, the number of SARS cases increased and these were associated with health systems primarily. 2 More than 90% of SARS cases in Taiwan have been correlated with the hospital settings. 3 Hospitals were seen as the source of SARS, even in areas where there were very few or no cases of SARS.",

Many patients with fever, either suspected or nonsuspected SARS, were anxious to rule out the possibility of SARS infection and were referred to EDs with typical or atypical clinical presentation. In this situation, it was very difficult for emergency physicians to identify patients with SARS early, specifically if there was neither a reliable exposure history nor a rapid diagnostic tool. Therefore, EDs had the greatest risk of exposure to new cases of SARS. Hospital managers took additional policies, such as setting a fever screening station or outdoor emergency room to stop hospital transmission and prevent any possible SARS cases into the hospital. 4 In addition, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of suspected and probable cases of SARS, there were low sensitivity and specificity rates in detecting SARS in the Hong Kong area. 5 To improve the possibly low sensitivity of the WHO criteria, we established a predictive scoring system using a two-stage stepwise method at fever screening stations to early detect possible SARS cases and contain SARS outbreak effectively.",

In the early stage of the disease, some patients may not qualify as SARS suspected patients as outlined by the CDC SARS reporting criteria. Thus, the patients may leave the emergency room. However, when these patients were diagnosed by other hospitals as SARS probable cases, the CDC would then notify the hospitals to which the patient previously presented. SPSS for Windows (version 11, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyse the data. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the categorical variables. Continuous variables were expressed as the mean (standard deviation). The x 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used to establish statistical significance. The sensitivity, specificity, and overtriage and undertriage rates of CDC reporting criteria for identifying probable SARS cases were also determined. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was used to determine the cut off points of each score and the areas under the curves were calculated to obtain the best balance between sensitivity and specificity.

The rationale of fever surveillance to identify a patient with SARS is based on the triage score, CBC, and chest x ray result. The ROC curves analysis was used to determine the cut off points of each score and the areas under the curves were calculated to obtain the best balance between sensitivity and specificity ( fig 2) Limitations There are limitations to the present study. Firstly, the predictive ability of the scoring system needs to be validated in other endemic areas. Secondly, the same groups of researchers did not obtain the history of febrile patients. However, all followed our special chart. The questionnaires were designed only based on Yes or No answers. Thirdly, symptoms after hospitalisation were not included in our analysis, although these symptoms may be helpful in making an early diagnosis. Fourthly, other infectious diseases, such as bird flu or influenza, could also affect the predictive ability.",

The WHO reporting of confirmed SARS is slow and less sensitive for these purposes, although it remained necessary. Most emergency physicians found diagnosis of SARS difficult according to the WHO criteria. 6 7 In addition, although some confirmatory tests, such as real time polymerase chain reaction and measurements of coronavirus antibody have been conducted in many laboratories, 8 they could not provide instant and correct information for clinicians initially. Therefore, in the absence of effective diagnostic tools during the SARS endemic, syndromic surveillance (such as fever) augments traditional surveillance (such as travel history to endemic area and SARS contact history taking) by monitoring other information to identify a possible SARS outbreak. 9 10 In our cohort study, there were four personal histories and two symptoms of the six predictive risk factors. Although many studies demonstrated the array of initial symptoms occurring in SARS patients, such as fever, cough, maylgia, diarrhoea, and dyspnoea, 5-9 1213 only two symptomatic risk factors-dyspnoea and diarrhoea-were identified in univariate analysis. At the cut off value of one point, the triage scores had a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 73.6% for SARS. This result revealed that if a patient with fever had any one of the epidemiological histories or symptoms, he should be referred to the fever screening station for further investigation.",

After calculating the sum of the two stages of scores at the cut off value of three points, the screening station score had a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 87.2% for SARS. These effective clinical decision rules provided higher sensitivity and specificity than the WHO criteria. According to our 10 item clinical scores and a cutoff value of 3, patients presenting with a total score equal to or more than 3 would be considered as probably having SARS. This predictive scoring system helped our hospital out of SARS transmission and outbreak. In addition, overdiagnosis and stringent isolation and quarantine could be avoided, especially in the lack of adequate isolation rooms. In our study, SARS patients had a higher prevalence of lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and lung infiltration in chest radiography as compared to non-SARS patients with fever. The finding of leukocytosis occurred less often in SARS patients. As a result, we suggested that haematological and chest Admitted to fever isolation ward roentgen examination could make the screening process more reliable and suitable in the outdoor fever screening station. By using the model of two stages of a predictive scoring system, all emergency physicians should take our study results into consideration when dealing with this new contagious disease. A good reporting system and well developed surveillance were paramount to prevent the spread of SARS. Syndromic surveillance was reinitiated in spring 2003 for severe acute respiratory syndrome. According to the WHO case definition and triage advice, we created an ED triage screening tool. This scoring system is simple and useful in both the hospitals and community screening. If the scoring system could be applied in community hospital EDs, the consequence of unnecessary admission and isolation, stringent quarantine, or massive society anxiety could be minimised-even during an outbreak such as the Amoy Garden Outbreak in Hong Kong. Vehicles with portable x ray and complete white blood count machines could be sent to the epidemic areas to screen any possible febrile patients promptly. Early detection and proper surveillance could be achieved by performing current predictive scoring system.",
