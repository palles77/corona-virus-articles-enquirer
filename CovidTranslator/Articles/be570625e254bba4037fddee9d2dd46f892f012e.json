These fragments were located in ORF1a (genome position 10,265 to 11,361 in EMC/2012 reference genome; Genbank Acc No. JX869059); the Spike gene (genome position 23,864 to 24,909); and ORF4b (genome position 26,025 to 27,020). Selection of samples for sequencing was based on availability of sample volume and viral RNA concentration as per initial real-time PCR testing (minimum, CT = 35). All RT-PCR primers and protocols were described before 1 . The three genome regions were selected to generate genomic data before and after known recombination breakpoint 2, 3 , and to include the region within ORF4b that was reported to show specific deletion patterns in African isolates 4 . The concatenated sequences of these fragments covered approximately 3140 nucleotides (~10% of a typical complete MERS-CoV genome with a size of ~30,120 nucleotides). After Sanger sequencing, we selected 22 samples to represent all clades observed in initial phylogenetic analyses using the concatenated fragments. Full genome sequences from 24 local camel samples were also generated.",

Second, all reads matching this database were used for de-novo genome assembly by SPAdes within Geneious 9.1.8. Third, all HTS reads were used for specific reference-mapping against the de-novo assembled consensus sequences and MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 in Geneious 9.1.8. After performing multiple iterations nearly complete consensus genomes could be generated for all samples. The denovo and the mapping approach did not result in discordant consensus sequences. Nevertheless, genome regions with low coverage (<10 reads), sequencing gaps, and deletions as compared to reference sequences from Genbank were amplified by bridging RT-PCR using MERS-CoV specific primers and sequenced by dye terminator chemistry (Microsynth Seqlab, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany).",

Alignments were made using MAFFT 5 in Geneious R11 (www.geneious.com, Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand). Bayesian phylogeographic reconstructions were made using Beast 1.10.4 6 under assumption of a Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano (HKY) gamma 4 nucleotide substitution model as in Dudas et al. 7 a strict molecular clock, and a calibration of substitution rate based on recorded or database-derived sampling dates of taxa. Geographic locations were reconstructed at all tree nodes based on phylogeographic diffusion in discrete space using trait matrices that incorporate geographic centers of countries of origin (Morocco, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Egypt, Sudan, Djibouti, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates). A Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) procedure was chosen, in order to limit the number of migration rates to only those that are necessary to explain the overall changes of location traits in light of the underlying phylogenetic tree structure 8 . Significance of migration rates is determined by toggled rate indicators for each migration rate in the trait change matrix, followed by Bayes factor analyses of posterior versus prior probability of the rate of interest activated. Phylogeographic rendering as well as Bayes factor analysis was done in SpreaD3 9 . Recombination analyses were made using SimPlot V3.5 10 and RDP V4.95 11 .",

In accordance with Dudas et al. 7 , we followed the rationale that human primary cases or unique viruses observed in outbreaks represent one-time samples from the ongoing enzootic circulation in camels. We removed all human cases except primary cases and outbreak index cases. For data published up to 2015, we used the same index sequences from human outbreaks as in Dudas et al. 7 . For sequences published in GenBank after 2015, index cases could often not be identified due to a lack of associated scientific publications. We therefore identified clusters of similar humanderived sequences that fell into timeframes compatible with outbreak settings (typically, phylogenetically clustered human samples taken within up to 3 months from each other) and removed all sequences except one representative from these potential human-to-human clusters. More than one sequence per time cluster was only left in the dataset when these sequences were considerably different from each other, suggesting no transmission link between humans (=these sequences were regarded as likely to represent independent index sequences). This curation of the dataset caused reduction of the original alignment from 261 to 178 sequences (refer to supplementary material, Table 2 ).",

Camels serve community, trading, farming, transportation, and leisure-related purposes and are also sources of milk, meat, wool and leather. The main source of dromedary camels for the Arabian Peninsula is the importation of life camels from the Horn of Africa (Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Kenya and Djibouti), and North Africa (mainly Egypt, Libya) mainly through the ports of Jeddah and, to a much lesser extent, Jizan in Saudi Arabia 14 .

A report by Abdallah et al. 16 described 6 types of camel farms and husbandry in Saudi Arabia; commercial farms, racing farms, use of camels for leisure for urban dwellers (weekend farms), traditional camel farms, camels for renting and camels for prestige. Camel herds are frequently moved across the Arabian Peninsula and may cross the borders of other Gulf countries for reasons such as grazing, participation in camel races and camel trade fairs. However, there is no official national identification procedure, nor is there an obligatory vaccination campaign focused on camels; it is difficult to quantify the extent of animal movements. Some general patterns are known. For instance, camels from both UAE and Qatar are moved every year during the winter season (November -February) for grazing in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Detailed spatiotemporal studies of camel movement patterns are lacking, but camels are generally moved and traded over wide distances. This is also reflected in scientific data. For instance, a recent study observed little phylogeographic signal in genetic analyses of the modern dromedary population, indicative of extensive gene flow 17 .",

Accordingly: 154 / 186,750*4.63 = 0.0038, parametrized as a lognormal distribution with M= -5.5, S = 1.25.
