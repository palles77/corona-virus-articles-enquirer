An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an episode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation. Objectives: To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and highthroughput cDNA sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: Four of forty-three patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [ 12] ) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls (P \u00bc 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of TTV but did not identify additional viruses.",

It is the first study to do this in acute exacerbation of IPF. Our use of sequencing to confirm all suspected viruses rules out the possibility of spurious PCR results, a common pitfall of the technique. Second, our large cohort of well-defined patients with acute exacerbation with adequate controls allows for greater certainty regarding our conclusions. Third, we have identified an unexpected virus (TTV) that was associated with 33% of acute exacerbations, and that was absent in stable IPF.",

            "text": "The pathogenetic significance of TTV in acute exacerbation of IPF BAL is unclear. TTV is a nonenveloped single-stranded circular DNA virus that exists in a genetically diverse clade (22, 23) . The virus seems to have broad tissue tropism because it has been detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow, spleen, liver, and lung (22) . Infection with TTV in the human population is worldwide, with prevalences of viremia ranging from 8%-80% depending on the population studied and detection methodology used. When only considering the hemi-nested PCR of the N22 region used in this study, rates of TTV DNA found in healthy blood donors range from 8.4%-12% (24, 25) and do not seem to correlate with the geographic location of the patients. Most infected subjects are asymptomatic, and to date efforts to link TTV viremia with any acute or chronic pathologic state have been unsuccessful (22) . Although there have been reports of TTV in the upper respiratory tract (nasopharynx and oral cavity) (26), TTV has not been identified in BAL fluids. TTV has previously been detected in the serum of 12 (36%) of 33 Japanese patients with IPF. In this study, TTV appeared more frequently in cases that progressed to acute exacerbations, and TTV positivity was suggested to correlate with worse survival (27) . Our findings do not show a correlation between the presence of TTV in the serum and the presence of TTV in the BAL, or any correlation between serum TTV positivity and a diagnosis of acute exacerbation.",

Although this does not exclude a potential role for TTV in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of IPF, it is also compatible with the idea that inflammation or injury in the lung may nonspecifically trigger local TTV replication, or may result in increased vascular permeability in the lung allowing circulating virus to enter the alveolar compartment. In the latter two cases, the presence of TTV would represent a consequence of lung inflammation rather than its cause. The idea that local TTV replication might be enhanced by underlying inflammatory signaling is supported by in vitro studies of PBMCs from donors who are TTV negative (28) . These PBMCs were infected in vitro with TTV, cultured with and without the presence of phytohemagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin-2, and then examined for evidence of TTV replication. In this experiment, TTV mRNA and replicative intermediates were only found in the stimulated PBMCs, consistent with an infectionamplifying role for inflammatory signaling.",

The multiplex nested PCR is several fold more sensitive than virus culture and direct immunofluorescent tests, with the ability to amplify less than 10 copies of target nucleic acid (15) . For viral discovery, however, PCR is of limited use because it identifies only a priori viral targets. Pan-viral microarray precludes the need for a preconceived list of targets, although even with its proved sensitivity, its benefit is dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio of the nucleic acid (19) . The use of deep sequencing to look further for evidence of viral infection in a high-risk subpopulation of patients with acute exacerbation therefore adds confidence to our results, because it produces an unbiased, high-resolution description of the microbial landscape of the sample tested. This technology has been used to identify novel viruses in human diarrhea, and to describe the microbiome of the distal gut (31, 32) , but never in BAL (29, 30) . In the current study, two samples subjected to deep sequencing were positive for known viruses by PCR and pan-viral array screening. Using an efficient and sensitive pipeline for sorting reads, these positive PCR findings were confirmed, and no additional viruses were detected in these or the other samples tested. Interpretation of these findings must be tempered by the fact that existing computational methods for recognizing potential viral genomes are imperfect, and may fail to identify novel agents with only limited homology to known viral genera. The same is true of array-based viral detection methods.",

Importantly, no difference in the time from symptom onset to sample collection was found between virus-positive and virus-negative cases. The duration of replicating virus in BAL is largely unknown, and it is possible that a virus could have stopped shedding during this time. In this study, we have maximized our likelihood of detecting virus by obtaining BAL samples early after admission and using highly sensitive viral detection techniques.",
