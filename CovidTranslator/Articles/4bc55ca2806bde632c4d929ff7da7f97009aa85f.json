Here we show that avian influenza A H5N1-infected patients exhibit markedly increased serum levels of angiotensin II. High serum levels of angiotensin II appear to be linked to the severity and lethality of infection, at least in some patients. In experimental mouse models, infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 virus results in downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the lung and increased serum angiotensin II levels. Genetic inactivation of ACE2 causes severe lung injury in H5N1-challenged mice, confirming a role of ACE2 in H5N1-induced lung pathologies. Administration of recombinant human ACE2 ameliorates avian influenza H5N1 virus-induced lung injury in mice. Our data link H5N1 virus-induced acute lung failure to ACE2 and provide a potential treatment strategy to address future flu pandemics.",

Human-to-human transmission of H5N1 viruses is rare and human infections have been primarily limited to people in very close contact with infected birds 2,3 . Many viruses, including H5N1, mutate readily and produce strains that are no longer manageable using vaccines or currently known antiviral drugs 4 .

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its later discovered sibling ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain and have opposite functions in the RAS 9 . ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, which is a key effector peptide and exerts multiple biological functions related to cardiovascular and renal biology 10 . In contrast, ACE2 cleaves a single amino acid residue from Angiotensin II to generate Ang1-7 and thereby negatively regulates the RAS by reducing Angiotensin II level 11, 12 . Our previous studies using ACE2knockout mice have demonstrated that ACE2 protects against acute lung injury (ALI) triggered by acid aspiration and sepsis 13 . Furthermore, ACE2 has been identified as the essential in vivo receptor for the SARS-Corona virus. SARS-CoV infections and the in vivo administration of the SARS-CoV spike protein reduce ACE2 expression 14 , suggesting that the RAS is involved in the pathogenesis of ALI and SARS-CoV infections 14 . Importantly, the administration of recombinant ACE2 has been proven beneficial in improving lung pathologies associated with SARS-CoV spike-, acid aspiration-and sepsis-induced ALI in different species 13, 14 . Based on these data, ACE2 has now entered phase II clinical testing for the treatment of ALI in humans.",

Moreover, the wet-to-dry lung tissue ratio, which is a measure of lung edema, was markedly higher in the ACE2knockout mice 3 days after infection (n \u00bc 4-6 per group, Fig. 3d ), supporting the hypothesis that ACE2 has a protective role against H5N1 virus-induced acute lung failure. H5N1 challenge also resulted in increased inflammatory cell infiltration, and a more severe lung injury score (including increased alveolar wall thickness, formation of hyaline membranes and proteinaceous debris filling the airspaces), in the ACE2-knockout mice (n \u00bc 3 per group, Fig. 3e ). Thus, the genetic inactivation of ACE2 expression results in a lower survival rate and more severe ALI following respiratory H5N1 infections.",

Moreover, hACE2 treatment improved the impaired lung functions of mice challenged with an inactivated H5N1 virus, as assessed via lung elastance ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Of note, lung elastance is the reciprocal of lung compliance, a measure of the change in pressure per unit change in volume representing the stiffness of the lungs 26 . To assess whether administration of recombinant hACE2 is also effective after virus infection, we treated mice with recombinant hACE2 protein 1 h, 1 day and 2 days after H5N1 infection (i.p. 100 mg kg \u00c0 1 ). Recombinant human ACE2 again ameliorated ALI induced in H5N1 infected mice ( Supplementary  Fig. 4 ). Further studies are required to assess the therapeutic efficacy of ACE2. Taken together, these data show that avian influenza A H5N1 virus infections cause severe acute lung failure, at least in part, by functionally altering the RAS via ACE2 expression and that H5N1-induced lung injury can be alleviated by the administration of recombinant human ACE2 protein.",
