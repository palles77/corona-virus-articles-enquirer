Objectives: To determine whether the structural proteins M and N of SARS-CoV induce apoptosis. Study design: We investigated human pulmonary fibroblast (HPF) cells, were transfected with plasmids containing the M or N gene, by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), Hoechst 33342 staining for nuclei, and observation of morphology. Results: We found that in the absence of serum about 16.34% of cells transfected by pcDNA3.1-M and 21.72% of Ntransfected cells showed typical apoptotic characteristics, significantly different from mock-transfected cells (only 6.23%, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the cells that were co-transfected with M and N proteins showed more obvious phenomena of cell death (about 36.03%). There was a statistical significance between M-transfected cells and co-transfected cells ( p < 0.01), and a remarkable difference between N-transfected cells and co-transfected cells ( p < 0.01). Conclusions: The results show that M and N proteins of SARS-CoV can induce apoptosis of HPF cells. Co-transfection of M and N enhances the induction of apoptosis by M or N alone, which also suggests that the structural proteins of SARS-CoV may play an important role not only in the process of invasion but also in the pathogenetic process in cells.",

            "text": "The pathogen of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a novel coronavirus. Sequence analysis of a limited region of the replicase (rep) gene and phylogenetic analyses of the sequence of SARS-CoV suggested that it was distinct from all other coronaviruses. However, the genomic organization of SARS-CoV is typical of coro-naviruses, and the genome encodes proteins of similar structures to those of other coronaviruses, including S, E, M, and N proteins. All of them play an important role during host cell entry and virion morphogenesis and release (Rota et al., 2003) . N protein can bind to a defined packaging signal on viral RNA, leading to the formation of the nucleocapsid. It also contains two nuclear localization signals. It is possible that the SARS virus nucleocapsid protein has a novel nuclear function, which could play a role in pathogenesis (Marra et al., 2003) . M protein is localized at specialized intracellular membrane structures. Interactions between the M and E proteins and nucleocapsid result in budding through the membrane. By interaction with S protein, the latter is incorporated into the viral envelope, which is an important step of the assembly of virus particles. Therefore, all of these proteins may correlate with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and study of them could help reveal the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV and indicate effective means of SARS therapy.",

            "text": "Some recent reports of research on the proteins of SARS-CoV refer to the cell apoptosis induced by proteins of SARS-CoV. Apoptosis is a kind of programmed cell death that does not cause any inflammatory reaction in vivo. Generally, virus can promote or inhibit the apoptosis of host cells. During SARS, apoptosis is a common phenomenon. Apoptotic cells increased significantly in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes of SARS patients as compared with normal tissues. Yan et al. (2004) reported that SARS-CoV infection induced the apoptosis of Vero E6. Jin et al. (2004) reported that the apoptosis of T lymphocytes mediated by Fas/FasL might play an important role in the cytoimmunological pathogenesis and pathophysiology of SARS. Surjit et al. (2004) showed that SARS-CoV N is capable of inducing apoptosis of COS-1 monkey kidney cells in the absence of growth factors by regulating the p38 MAPK pathway and inducing actin reorganization in cells devoid of growth factors. Tan et al. (2004) demonstrated that the overexpression of 7a protein induces apoptosis in many cell lines derived from different organs, including lung, kidney, and liver. Chow et al. (2005) demonstrated that the adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and its C-terminal domain (S2) induces apoptosis in Vero E6 cells in a timeand dose-dependent manner. Yuan et al. (2005) demonstrated that overexpression of 3b-EGFP fusion protein could induce cell cycle arrest at G 0 /G 1 phase in Vero, 293, and COS-7 cells and could induce apoptosis in COS-7 cells. Yang et al. (2005) reported that SARS-CoV E protein induced apoptosis in transfected Jurkat T-cells, and the apoptosis rate was amplified in the absence of growth factors. The apoptosis could be inhibited by overexpressed antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Law et al. (2005) showed that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV could induce apoptosis in Vero E6 cells.",

Although overall sequence conservation is low, the predicted M and N proteins of SARS-CoV contain conserved motifs that are found in other coronaviruses. Therefore, SARS-CoV may share the similar pathogenic mechanism with other coronaviruses. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV M and N proteins can induce apoptosis of HPF cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that SARS proteins can induce apoptosis in primary human cells. This conclusion confirms our previous findings. Adult Brandt's voles that were infected with SARS-CoV showed hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonia, a clot in liver, spleen, and kidney, and local hemorrhage spot in lung (Gao et al., 2005) . Cell apoptosis was one of the major reasons for these changes. To verify this, we chose two major structural proteins (M and N) for study. Plasmids containing them were transfected into HPF cells and were shown to be expressed by immunofluorescence staining and Hoechst staining, TUNEL assays were performed to detect cell death 48 h post transfection. The results demonstrated that M and N proteins can induce apoptosis of HPF to some degree. Furthermore, the apoptosis was observed only in the absence of serum and few cells were dead in the presence of serum, as in the control. This finding corresponds to previous reports (Surjit et al., 2004) . It may be that some survival pathway is activated by growth factors and other components in the serum, and inhibits apoptotic pathways (Surjit et al., 2004) .",

This may be concerned with the complex formation of SARS proteins in cells and suggests that SARS proteins may work in a complex form. However, the effect of co-transfection is not simply the sum of the effects of transfection with the individual plasmids. The co-transfected cells were almost all dead 48 h post transfection in the absence of serum, and only a few cells were still adhesive, while most of the cells transfected with only one plasmid were still adhesive in the same condition. Therefore, the com- plex may be the natural and toxic form of SARS proteins in cells. He et al. (2004) reported that interaction of the N and M proteins could take place in vivo and identified that a stretch of amino acids (AA residues numbers 168-208) in the N protein may be critical for such proteinprotein interactions. It could be a new target for SARS therapy by destroying the complex or making it as a new specific antigen. We injected a mixture of pVAX1-M and pVAX1-N into Balb/c mice, which elicit humoral and cellular responses. (Shu-Qun Shi et al., in press) . The result showed that membrane protein could augment the Nspecific immune responses. N-transfected cells show more notable differences than M-transfected cells. This seems to suggest that N protein is the core of the apoptosis inducers and that M proteins might enhance the effect of N protein by formation of protein complexes or by other means.",

HPF cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1-N or -M or with mock plasmid reacted with antisera and secondary antibody conjugated with FITC, as described in Materials and Methods. These cells were counterstained with propidium iodide for visualization of nuclei of all cells and analyzed for expression by confocal microscopy 24 h post transfection by lipofectamine 2000. (A) HPF cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-M, reacted with the antisera from pcDNA3.1-M-immunized mice. (B) HPF cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, reacted with the antisera from pcDNA3.1-M-immunized mice. (C) HPF cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-N, reacted with the antisera from pcDNA3.1-N-immunized mice. (D) HPF cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, reacted with the antisera from pcDNA3.1-N-immunized mice.
