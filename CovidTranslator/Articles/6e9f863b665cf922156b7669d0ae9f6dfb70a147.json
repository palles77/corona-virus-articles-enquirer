            "text": "Elicitation for phytochemical enhancement via cost-effective elicitors can overcome the limitation of commercial application faced by plant cell and organ culture technology. Chitosan is a natural, low-cost, and nontoxic elicitor that can trigger plant defense responses with the concomitant enhancement in phytochemical biosynthesis. In this work, the elicitation of Isatis tinctoria L. hairy root cultures by chitosan was conducted to enhance the production of pharmacologically active flavonoids. In comparison with control (2.31 \u00b1 0.29 mg/g DW), a 7.08-fold enhancement of total flavonoids (16.35 \u00b1 0.88 mg/g DW) was achieved in 24 day-old I. tinctoria hairy root cultures elicited by 150 mg/L chitosan for 36 h. Interestingly, the multiple hydroxyl-substituted flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and isoliquiritigenin) were noticed to increase significantly in chitosan-elicited I. tinctoria hairy root cultures. Moreover, the transcription of associated genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was significantly up-regulated underlying chitosan elicitation, among which chalcone synthase and flavonoid 3\u2032-hydroxylase might play an important role in flavonoid enhancement. Additionally, extracts from chitosan-elicited I. tinctoria hairy root cultures exhibited higher antioxidant activities with lower IC 50 values as compared with control. Overall, a cost-effective strategy via the simple chitosan elicitation is provided here to enhance the production of high-added value flavonoids in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures, which paves the way toward the successful commercialization of this in vitro culture system in the future.",

            "text": "Isatis tinctoria L. is an economically important crop widely cultivated in the northern region of China (Ni et al., 2012) . Its dried root named \"Banlangen\" in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), is one of the topselling herbs in East Asian, due to the notable clinical treatment efficacy of influenza, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) (Xiao et al., 2015) . I. tinctoria root is commonly processed into two commercial pharmaceutical preparations, namely \"Banlangen Keli\" and \"Banlangen Tangjiang\", which can be sold as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs at the pharmacy (Zhou and Zhang, 2013) . Phenylpropanoids (flavonoids and lignans) are thought to be primarily related to the outstanding pharmacological activity of I. tinctoria (Nguyen et al., 2017) . During the long-term evolution, plants can produce a huge number of secondary metabolites that play a crucial role in interaction with environmental factors and defense against unfavorable conditions (Ramirez-Estrada et al., 2016) . Thus, the field cultivation of I. tinctoria is associated with an important challenge that the phytochemical profile is highly affected by geographical regions, climatic fluctuations, and soil conditions, which can significantly affect the therapeutic efficacy of I. tinctoria root . To overcome this issue, an in vitro culture system has been developed, i.e. I. tinctoria hairy root cultures (ITHRCs), as an alternative to the field cultivation for the sustainable and standard production of bioactive flavonoids (Gai et al., 2015) .",

Jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and their analog derivatives are the most commonly used elicitors in plant cell and organ cultures (Nartop, 2018) . Nevertheless, these elicitors are expensive, which presents an inevitable obstacle from the perspective of commercial applications (Giri and Zaheer, 2016) .

In this work, the effect of chitosan concentration and elicitation time on the total flavonoid yield in ITHRCs was initially studied. Afterwards, the profiles of eight flavonoids in ITHRCs with and without the appropriate chitosan elicitation were investigated. To clarify the molecular mechanism of flavonoid enhancement in ITHRCs underlying chitosan elicitation, the transcription of seven enzyme genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was monitored. For human health, ROS is implicated in numerous chronic diseases including coronary heart disease, cancer, brain dysfunction, diabetes, and others (L\u00f3pez-Alarc\u00f3n and Denicola, 2013) . Accordingly, antioxidant activities of extracts from ITHRCs following chitosan elicitation were evaluated. It is worth mentioning that there is no study regarding the application of chitosan to elevate flavonoid productivity, biosynthesis gene expression, and antioxidant activity in ITHRCs.",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 1 , different chitosan concentrations (50, 100, 150, 200, and 400 mg/L) exhibited distinct influences on total flavonoid yields in ITHRCs along a time course from 0 to 96 h. As expected, chitosan elicitation was indeed feasible for promoting flavonoid accumulation in ITHRCs over control. Regardless of concentrations, chitosan could induce the significant enhancement of flavonoids in ITHRCs after 6 and 12 h. This phenomenon was consistent with the rapid stimulation effect of elicitors subjected to plant in vitro cultures, which can alter the secondary metabolite profile within a short time (Narayani and Srivastava, 2017) . Taken as a whole, chitosan with moderate concentrations of 150 and 200 mg/L showed better elicitation efficiency at the time points of 36 and 30 h, where total flavonoid yields (16.35 \u00b1 0.88 and 16.67 \u00b1 1.16 mg/g DW) increased by 7.08-and 7.22-fold as compared with control (2.31 \u00b1 0.29 mg/g DW), respectively. However, there is no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the flavonoid productivity between the above two chitosan elicitation treatments. In consideration of elicitor cost, chitosan concentration 150 mg/L along with exposure time 36 h were adopted as the appropriate elicitation conditions. Moreover, it is noted that the high chitosan concentration (400 mg/L) with the long exposure time (72-96 h) was not favorable for flavonoid enhancement in ITHRCs.",

However, the chitosan elicitation conditions required for achieving the optimal enhancement of different target secondary metabolites are not the same in these reports and this work. Factually, the same elicitor possesses distinct abilities to induce the biosynthesis of different secondary metabolites, and there is complexity in the mechanism of action entailing variability of secondary metabolic responses to the stress mediated by elicitor due to thousands of intertwined events existing in plant cells (Giri and Zaheer, 2016; Narayani and Srivastava, 2017) .",

Moreover, plants have thresholds for specific secondary metabolites that can be synthesized by themselves. Once secondary metabolites are accumulated at high levels, plants will be stimulated to generate enzymes for product degradation through the feedback regulation (Malik et al., 2013) . As inferred, the appropriate chitosan elicitation (150 mg/L and 36 h) might maintain the balance between eustress and distress, which is beneficial for inducing the biosynthesis and accumulation of flavonoids in the elicited ITHRCs.",

            "text": "It is well acknowledged that CHS is the gatekeeper in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway that can catalyze the sequential addition of three units of malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to one unit of p-coumaroyl-CoA, yielding naringenin chalcone as the basic C6-C3-C6 skeleton for the subsequent flavonoid metabolism (Han et al., 2014) . Generally, the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis can be effectively achieved via controlling CHS gene expression. Schijlen et al. (2007) found that the RNA interference silencing of CHS gene in tomatoes could cause the reduction of total flavonoid levels to a few percent of those in wild-type ones. Rahnama et al. (2013) reported that the overexpression of CHS gene could result in the transgenic Silybum marianum hairy roots containing a 10-fold increase in silybin (an active flavonolignan) content. Moreover, CHS gene expression can be induced by environmental stresses such as fungal pathogen attack, wounding, or UV irradiation, which is capable of triggering the accumulation of flavonoid phytoalexins to improve plant resistance (Dao et al., 2011) . Factually, chitosan is the derivative of chitin (fungal cell wall component) can induce plant systemic resistance by mimicking fungal pathogen . In this study, the significant sensitivity of CHS gene expression to chitosan elicitation possibly contributed to enhance ITHRCs resistance by heightening flavonoid accumulation. Additionally, F3\u2032H gene plays an essential role in the regulation of rutin and quercetin biosynthesis because its encoding enzyme can catalyze the hydroxylation of flavonoid B-ring at the 3\u2032 position . Accordingly, the remarkable enhancement in the yields of rutin (8.27-fold increase) and quercetin (13.05-fold increase) might be attributed to the significant induction of F3'H transcription underlying chitosan elicitation.",

            "text": "It is clearly observed from Fig. 6 that chitosan-elicited samples exhibited superiority in antioxidant activities determined by the both methods. To be exact, extracts from chitosan-elicited ITHRCs showed better DPPH radical scavenging property and \u03b2-carotene bleaching inhibition capacity with lower IC 50 values (0.23 and 0.28 mg/mL) as against those in control (0.42 and 0.39 mg/mL), respectively. As mentioned above, the increased contents of multiple hydroxyl-substituted flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and isoliquiritigenin) in chitosan-elicited ITHRCs is likely to be responsible for scavenging the excess ROS induced by chitosan elicitation. Anyway, the objective existence of these polyhydroxylated flavonoids might contribute to the higher antioxidant activities of extracts from chitosan-elicited ITHRCs. Additionally, stress conditions can cause plant cells to overproduce other antioxidants, such as, glutathione, proline, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, and carotenoid (Gill and Tuteja, 2010) , which might also contribute to the increase in antioxidant activities of extracts from chitosan-elicited ITHRCs. Overall, chitosan-elicited ITHRCs could offer higher antioxidant extracts that would potentially improve the antiviral therapeutic benefits, and possess promising prospects for the development of antioxidant drugs or nutraceuticals.",

Results showed that 24 day-old ITHRCs elicited by 150 mg/L chitosan for 36 h gave a 7.08-fold increase in total flavonoid yield as compared with control. The price range of chitosan is $1-2/Kg in China. Accordingly, the cost range of chitosan used in this work for the aforementioned enhancement in flavonoid productivity per 100 L of ITHRCs is only $0.015-0.03. Especially, the significant increase in the contents of polyhydroxylated flavonoids was found in ITHRCs following chitosan elicitation. Moreover, the transcriptional activation of associated genes involved in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, especially CHS and F3'H genes, might account for the elevated level of flavonoids in chitosanelicited ITHRCs. Furthermore, antioxidant activity enhancement was noticed in the extracts from chitosan-elicited ITHRCs, which would expand the applicability in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical fields. Overall, the chitosan elicitation protocol proposed in this work will make ITHRCs more feasible for the large-scale production of pharmacologically active flavonoids on commercial scale in the future.
