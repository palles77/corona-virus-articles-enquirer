In this time of crisis, innovative and adaptive methods of practising will be required across all health professions. In order to maximise the use of current available resources, it is vital that existing services are comprehensively reviewed and full use is made of any unrealised potential among healthcare providers. Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to the current pandemic. As the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19 and maintaining the continuity of healthcare services. This article seeks to highlight roles and activities that community pharmacists can undertake to help in relieving pressure on other areas of the health service, such as general practice. This information could help to inform future decisions about the restructuring of existing health services by governments, public health bodies and policy makers in response to public health crises such as COVID-19.",

These include travel restrictions and the closure of schools, universities, bars, restaurants and retail shops. 1 The impact on every level of society has been profound and, over the coming weeks and months, the challenges faced by healthcare services will be compounded by the increased risk of infection among healthcare workers and ensuing staff absences due to illness or the need to self-isolate. 2 Community pharmacy is one of a number of health professions that has a key role to play in responding to this public health crisis. It is well established that community pharmacists are one of the most accessible healthcare professionals. 3 During the current pandemic, it is recognised that community pharmacies will often be the first point of contact with the health system for individuals with COVID-19 related health concerns or who require reliable information and advice. 4 During the previous H1N1 pandemic in 2009, community pharmacies were suitably placed to provide public health education and assist with vaccination. 5, 6 For example, using a simulation model, it was shown that community pharmacies could substantially increase the number of administered vaccine doses and reduce the time to achieve 80% single-dose coverage at population level. 6 A recent consensus exercise identified a wide range of roles that pharmacists can undertake in response to various types of disasters, such as pandemics, across four key phases (prevention, preparedness, response and recovery). 7 More recently, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) published interim guidelines for the pharmacy workforce that outline key activities that form part of pharmacists' professional responsibility during the current pandemic. 4 An adapted summary of key roles and activities outlined in these reference sources is provided in Table 1 . In the absence of an effective and approved vaccine or treatment for COVID-19, an early account of experiences within the community pharmacy setting in China following the outbreak highlights important actions that pharmacists can take as part of the global response to the pandemic. 8 These include the provision of public health advice and education on personal and environmental hygiene, and making appropriate referrals in cases of suspected symptoms.",

Depending on the nature and severity of these ailments, previous research has shown that a sizeable proportion of cases can be effectively managed in the community pharmacy setting with a high degree of patient satisfaction. 14 This is vital to maximising the efficiency of health service delivery as data from the UK indicates that more than one in 10 general practitioner (GP) visits and one in 20 emergency department visits are for minor ailments that could be managed in community pharmacies. 15 Work has been undertaken to develop a definitive list of low acuity conditions (i.e. common self-limiting or uncomplicated conditions) that can be clinically assessed and managed by community pharmacists. 16 These include allergies and skin rashes, coughs and colds, and gastrointestinal complaints, and serve to highlight the vast range of symptoms and conditions that can be managed in the community pharmacy setting. For example, springtime typically marks the commencement of hay fever symptoms which affect many patients worldwide. 17 A range of effective treatments are available over the counter (OTC) in community pharmacies to help treat and prevent hay fever symptoms (e.g. antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids). 18 However, in order for eligible patients to obtain these medications (or medications for other minor ailments) free of charge on public health schemes, they typically need a prescription from their GP to avoid paying for the OTC medication out-of-pocket.",

In contrast, supplementary prescribing involves a partnership between an independent prescriber and the pharmacist, as the supplementary prescriber, who is then responsible for implementing an agreed patient-specific clinical management plan.",

Patient requests for emergency supplies of medications are encountered on a regular basis in practice, primarily out of hours. 27, 28 Oftentimes, these requests are from older patients and individuals with long-term conditions. Community pharmacists are well placed to handle out of hours emergency supply requests and can help to divert patients from emergency care services. 29 However, the maximum quantity of medication that can be supplied on the basis of such requests is limited. For example, in Ireland this is typically restricted to five days' supply with some exceptions (e.g. inhalers, topical preparations). Under the current circumstances, the permitted duration of supply may need to be extended as happened following Hurricane Katrina, where one US state increased the quantity of medication that could be supplied to patients with chronic conditions from three days to 30 days. 7",

[33] [34] [35] Although guidelines and frameworks exist to aid health systems in managing medication shortages, 36, 37 no single approach can completely eliminate the clinical implications and associated risks for patients. Pharmacists are well positioned to reduce risks of further medication shortages arising from COVID-19 by reassuring patients and members of the public of the continued availability of OTC and prescription medications based on rational levels of demand and implementing policies to prevent unnecessary stockpiling. These could include limits on the quantity of medication dispensed (e.g. one month's supply at time). Preventing stockpiling of OTC medications may, however, prove more challenging.",

Community pharmacists have an important role to play in promoting medication adherence through the provision of evidence-based interventions. 40, 41 However, income losses in particular may affect patients' abilities to continue to pay for their medications. Current medication reimbursement policies should be re-examined in light of the acute income losses faced by many individuals whose jobs have either been lost or are now under threat. For example, access to medication on public health schemes may need to be increased and prescription copayments for patients who obtain their medications on such schemes may need to be reconsidered as these can also negatively impact on medication adherence. 42",

For example, in order to promote social distancing and facilitate self-isolation while ensuring that patients continue to have access to vital pharmacy services, new methods of service delivery will play an increasing role. These could include medication delivery services and video-based consultations. 47, 48 It is important that any potential new services are reviewed by relevant professional bodies and provisions put in place for adequate support and resourcing. At an appropriate stage in the future, when current curtailment efforts have taken effect, and time and resources allow, mechanisms should also be put in place to ensure that the experiences of key stakeholders (e.g. pharmacists, patients, policymakers) and other relevant data are collected, evaluated and disseminated to help ensure evidence-based responses to future public health crises.",
