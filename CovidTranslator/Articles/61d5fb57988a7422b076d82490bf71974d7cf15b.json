            "text": "Background: Little is known about post-infectious pulmonary sequelae in countries like Cambodia where tuberculosis is hyper-endemic and childhood pulmonary infections are highly frequent. We describe the characteristics of hospitalized Cambodian patients presenting with community-acquired acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) on post-infectious pulmonary sequelae (ALRIPS). Methods: Between 2007 and 2010, inpatients 15 years with ALRI were prospectively recruited. Clinical, biological, radiological and microbiological data were collected. Chest radiographs were re-interpreted by experts to compare patients with ALRIPS, on previously healthy lungs (ALRIHL) and active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Patients without chest radiograph abnormality or with abnormality suggestive as other chronic respiratory diseases were excluded from this analysis. Results: Among the 2351 inpatients with community-acquired ALRI, 1800 were eligible: 426 (18%) ALRIPS, 878 (37%) ALRIHL and 496 (21%) TB. ALRIPS patients had less frequent fever than other ALRI (p < 0.001) and more productive cough than ALRIHL (p < 0.001). Streptococcus Respiratory Medicine (2013) 107, 1625e1632 pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 83% of AL-RIPS group positive cultures. H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were significantly associated with ALRIPS compared with ALRIHL. Treatment was appropriate in 58% of ALRIPS patients. Finally, 79% of ALRIPS were not recognized by local clinicians. In-hospital mortality was low (1%) but probably underestimated in the ALRIPS group. Conclusion: ALRIPS remains often misdiagnosed as TB with inappropriate treatment in lowincome countries. Better-targeted training programs would help reduce the morbidity burden and financial costs. \u00aa",

Despite a clear reduction in TB incidence between 2010 and 2011, post-TB pulmonary sequelae remain under-recognized in most countries. The direct link between the number of TB episodes and lung damage is well documented [2] . In addition, widespread lung destruction may occur in spite of effective anti-tuberculous therapy. Subsequent healing may result in extensive fibrosis, bronchostenosis, pleura remodeling with loss of pulmonary volume and traction bronchiectasis [3] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Cambodia was the country with the highest documented TB prevalence worldwide at 817/100 000 population in 2012 [1] . Other under-treated bacterial infections such as pulmonary abscesses or purulent pleurisies may also cause pulmonary and/or pleural sequelae. Finally, bronchiectasis may result from acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) with both tuberculous and severe nontuberculous pathogens, which are highly prevalent in Cambodian children [4] .",

Direct sputum examination for acidfast bacilli (AFB) were performed at the hospital laboratories for each patient on admission and repeated during the following two days. In accordance with Cambodia's national TB recommendations, culture was not systematically performed. A single chest radiograph per patient was performed on admission.

In our study, nearly one in four adult patients admitted for ALRI presented superinfection on post-infectious sequelae. These patients were mostly aged 50 and above. Chronic pulmonary disease was often very advanced and associated with Gram-negative bacilli and S. pneumoniae. Although AFB smears remained negative, these cases of superinfected sequelae were misdiagnosed and sometimes treated as active TB. Furthermore, the empiric first-line antibiotic treatment used was inappropriate according to the antibiotic susceptibility testing results in nearly one in three cases. Clinical features were not helpful in distinguishing between active TB, ALRIHL and ALRIPS. Patients in the ALRIPS group had more productive cough and were less often febrile than in the other groups. But taken individually, these symptoms are poor clinical indicators. Hemoptysis was more prevalent in the ALRIPS group compared to both other groups, which is unsurprising due to the frequency of bronchiectasis in post-infectious sequelae. The relatively high proportion of hemoptysis in ALRIHL group may be due to necrotizing bacteria, K. pneumoniae or B. pseudomallei, which have previously been described by our team, or to smear-negative TB. [6, 7] . In Cambodia, smear-negative TB accounted for 20% of the 38 555 TB cases notified in 2011 [14] . Due to limitations of Cambodian laboratory facilities, TB culture is not available.

Cambodian antibiotics guidelines for ALRI are currently under revision and will be adjusted to the local epidemiology. In theory, amoxicillinclavulanate, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, or fluoroquinolones are possible choices for first line therapy. There are, however, two major obstacles to the broad use of fluoroquinolones as first-line empirical treatment in Cambodia. On one hand, ofloxacine and ciprofloxacine are not effective as anti-pneumococcal drugs and 13% of P. aeruginosa were resistant to ciprofloxacine in our study. On the other hand, fluoroquinolones currently remain active in TB. [26] . Generalization of fluoroquinolones use could therefore delay TB diagnosis, and trigger widespread emergence of resistant TB strains [27] . Since the presentation of the ALRIPS patients was less severe on admission, fluoroquinolones could be proposed in this group only as a second-line therapy if the first-line treatment is found to be ineffective upon re-evaluation and after the results of AFB screening.",

The SISEA project lacked funding to perform follow-up radiological assessment. Most (86%) of the radiographs in our ALRIPS group showed obvious sequelae, which could have easily been recognized by clinicians. However, chest radiographs have limited sensitivity to detect mild abnormalities, and especially bronchiectasis. Some cases with mild bronchiectasis could have been classified in ALRIHL group. In a Thai study on bronchiectasis, 10% of the patients with bronchiectasis detected by computed tomography (CT) scan had a normal chest radiograph [19] . CT scan would have been a better diagnosis tool than chest radiograph in this case, but unfortunately it is not available in Cambodian provincial hospitals.",

Improving the detection of chronic bronchitis signs, training clinicians on chest radiograph interpretation, implementing mycobacteria culture in Cambodian's laboratories, and implementing the use of simple spirometric measures could help this diagnosis. Further studies are needed to assess the decline of forced expiratory volume and the reduction of the longterm functional prognosis and quality of life of Cambodian patients, in addition to assess the generating added costs to families and the Cambodian health system.
