With the advancement of technologies, increasingly diverse methods are available which make it possible to detect and analyze any virus, including those, which cannot be cultured. The laboratory diagnosis of virus infection can be made by the detection of specifi c virus, viral antigen, genomic sequences and/or antibodies. Nucleic acid amplifi cation is one of the most valuable tools in virtually all life science fi elds, including application-oriented fi elds such as clinical medicine in which diagnosis of infectious diseases, genetic disorders and genetic traits are particularly benefi ted by this new technique. Now a days, several amplifi cation methods have been invented viz. nucleic acid sequence based amplifi cation (NASBA), Self-sustained sequence replication (3SR), Strand displacement amplifi cation (SDA) as well as Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Chan and Fox 1999) . These methods can amplify target nucleic acids to a similar magnitude, all with a detection limit of less than 10 copies and within a hour or so.",

            "text": "The development of technologies with rapid and sensitive detection capabilities and increased throughput have become crucial for responding to greater number threats posed by emerging and re-emerging viruses in the recent past. The conventional identifi cation methods require time-consuming culturing, and/ or detection of antibodies, which are not very sensitive and specifi c. The recent advances in molecular biology techniques in the fi eld of genomics and proteomics greatly facilitate the rapid identifi cation with more accuracy. We have developed two real-time assays ie., SYBR green I based real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP) assay for rapid detection as well as typing of some of the emerging viruses of biomedical importance viz. dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, west Nile, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) etc. Both these techniques are capable of detection and differentiation as well as quantifying viral load with higher sensitivity, rapidity, specifi city. One of the most important advantages of LAMP is its fi eld applicability, without requirement of any sophisticated equipments. Both these assays have been extensively evaluated and validated with clinical samples of recent epidemics from different parts of India. The establishment of these real time molecular assays will certainly facilitate the rapid detection of viruses with high degree of precision and accuracy in future. [Parida M M 2008 Rapid and real-time detection technologies for emerging viruses of biomedical importance; J. Biosci. 33 617-628]] of PCR as a standard approach in biotechnology and medical diagnostic laboratories has been usually practiced. During the past decade, various forms of PCRs such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Nested PCR and Multiplex PCR have been developed to address the need for rapid identifi cation of viruses to serotype level with more accuracy (Ratcliff et al 2007) . Despite the obtainable magnitude of amplifi cation, these PCR based methods require either high precision instruments for the amplifi cation or elaborate methods for detection of the amplifi ed products. In addition, these methods are often cumbersome to adapt for routine clinical use especially in peripheral health care settings and private clinics. In addition, the PCR method has several intrinsic disadvantages, such as the requirement of thermal cycling, insuffi cient specifi city and rather low amplifi cations effi ciency. More sensitive and real time based assays are therefore needed to complement the existing PCR based assay systems.",

Real-time PCR has enhanced wider acceptance of the PCR due to its improved rapidity, sensitivity, reproducibility and the reduced risk of carry-over contamination. Real-time PCR assays used for quantitative RT-PCR combine the best attributes of both relative and competitive (end-point) RT-PCR in that they are accurate, precise, capable of high throughput, and relatively easy to perform. The majority of diagnostic PCR assays reported to date have been used in a qualitative, or 'yes/no' format. The development of real-time PCR has brought true quantitation of target nucleic acids out of the pure research laboratory and into the diagnostic laboratory (Espy et al 2006) .",

With improved and automated nucleic acid sample isolation techniques, as well as real-time detection methods, a new generation of assays for most clinically important viruses is being developed (Niesters 2002) . QPCR assays based on SYBR Green and TaqMan chemistries have been developed and validated and are beginning to reveal the virus's epidemiology and pathogenesis (Gunson et al 2006; Watzinger et al 2006) . The QPCR assay also provides critical prognostic information for clinical management. More recently, real-time PCR assays have provided additional major contributions, with the inclusion of an additional fl uorescent probe detection system resulting in an increase in sensitivity over conventional PCR, the ability to confi rm the amplifi cation product and to quantitate the target concentration and detection of multiple targets in a single tube. Multiplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays have been developed for simultaneous detection, identifi cation and quantifi cation of HBV, HCV and HIV-1 in plasma or serum samples. Genomic amplifi cation of one virus was unaffected by the simultaneous amplifi cation of the other two. Although competition between HCV and HIV-1 amplifi cations slightly affected the yield of HIV-1 amplifi cation, quantifi cation of a single virus was possible. A novel QRTPCR assay consists of two multiplex reactions, one detecting infl uenza A and B and RSV, the other one PIV 1-4, and can generate a result within 6 h. Other real-time assays can differentiate between infl uenza A subtypes and RSV A and B facilitating diagnosis, patient management and strain identifi cation for vaccine production. QRTPCR based diagnostic assays have also been reported for the associated corona viruses and improved to give result in an assay with 100% specifi city in samples collected from day 1-3 of disease onset. The assay's potential for high throughput was also of critical importance in areas with outbreaks of SARS in which large numbers of specimens had to be tested. In addition, the ability to quantify helped elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease. QRTPCR assays can now be used routinely to exclude SARS-associated coronavirus in patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms even in the presence of other respiratory viruses. QRTPCR assays have also been developed for the clinical diagnosis of viral meningitis and to detect enteroviruses in cerebrospinal fl uid and are signifi cantly more sensitive than viral culture (Verstrepen et al 2001; Beuret 2004) .",

The amplifi cation proceeds at a constant temperature using strand displacement reaction. Amplifi cation and detection of gene can be completed in a single step, by incubating the mixture of samples, primers, DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and substrates at a constant temperature of 63\u00b0C. Compared to PCR and real-time PCR, the LAMP has the advantages of reaction simplicity and detection sensitivity. The higher sensitivity and specifi city of the LAMP reaction is attributed to continuous amplifi cation under isothermal condition employing six primers recognizing eight distinct regions of the target. Besides, the higher amplifi cation effi ciency of LAMP reaction yields large amount of byproduct, pyrophosphate ion, leading to white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate in the reaction mixture. Since the increase in turbidity of the reaction mixture according to the production of precipitate correlates with the amount of DNA synthesized, real-time monitoring of the LAMP reaction can be achieved by real-time measurement of turbidity (Mori et al 2001) .",

The FLP and BLP primers were composed of the sequences that are complementary to the sequence between F1 and F2 and B1 and B2 regions respectively ( (Notomi et al 2000) .",

Through the activity of DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity, a DNA strand complementary to the template DNA is synthesized, starting from the 3' end of the F2 region of the FIP. The F3 Primer anneals to the F3c region, outside of FIP, on the target DNA and initiates strand displacement DNA synthesis, releasing the FIP-linked complementary strand. A double strand is formed from the DNA strand synthesized from the F3 Primer and the template DNA strand. The FIP-linked complementary strand is released as a single strand because of the displacement by the DNA strand synthesized from the F3 Primer. Then, this released single strand forms a stem-loop structure at the 5' end because of the complementary F1c and F1 regions. This single strand DNA in turn serves as a template for BIP-initiated DNA synthesis and subsequent B3-primed strand displacement DNA synthesis. The BIP anneals to the DNA strand produced by the above step. Starting from the 3' end of the BIP, synthesis of complementary DNA takes place. Through this process, the DNA reverts from a loop structure into a linear structure. The B3 Primer anneals to the outside of the BIP and then, through the activity of the DNA polymerase and starting at the 3' end, the DNA synthesized from the BIP is displaced and released as a single strand before DNA synthesis from the B3 Primer. The BIP-linked complementary strand displaced forms a structure with stemloops at each end, which looks like a dumbbell structure. A dumbbell-like DNA structure is quickly converted into a stem-loop DNA by self-primed DNA synthesis. This structure serves as the starting structure for the exponential amplifi cation in cyclic manner.",

This released single strand forms a stem-loop structure at the 3' end because of complementary B1c and B1 regions.

Furthermore, BIP anneals to the B2c region and primes strand displacement DNA synthesis, releasing the B1primed DNA strand. As a result of this process, various sized structures consisting of alternately inverted repeats of the target sequence on the same strand are formed. The cycling reaction continues with accumulation of 10 9 copies of target in less than an hour.

In case of positive amplifi cation, the original orange color of the dye will change into green that can be judged under natural light as well as under UV light (302 nm) with the help of a hand held UV torch lamp.

Assessment of the load of the organisms/pathogens before, during and after therapy has tremendous potential for improving the clinical management of diseases. The quantifi cation of gene copy number and/or concentration of the organisms can be accomplished through generation of a standard curve by plotting a graph between known concentration of gene copy number or infectious unit of organisms and time of positivity to get the amplifi cation signal for that particular concentration. A linear relationship between various concentrations Vs time of positivity is usually obtained through the real-time monitoring of the amplifi cation (fi gure 7).

These gene based tests have several advantages over traditional antibodybased diagnostic methods that measure the body's immune response to a pathogen. In particular, LAMP is capable of detecting the presence of pathogenic agents earlier than PCR even on day one of fever where the amount of gene copy number is expected to be very low due to higher sensitivity with a detection limit of about 1-2 copies. Earlier detection of infection can mean earlier treatment and an earlier return to good health. The loop mediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP) assay is emerging as a simple, rapid and powerful gene amplifi cation technique for early detection of microbial diseases. Although the inception of LAMP refers back to 1998 but the popularity of LAMP starts only after 2003 following emergence of West Nile and SARS viruses. Since then, LAMP assay is increasingly being adapted by researchers mostly from Japan in clinical diagnosis of emerging diseases including bacteria, viruses and parasitic diseases. LAMP has been successfully applied for rapid and real-time detection of both DNA and RNA viruses. However, most of the published researches have been directed for RNA viruses may be due to the increased incidence of RNA viruses in recent past in the form of major epidemic having signifi cant public health importance. A one-step single tube real-time accelerated reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplifi cation (RT-LAMP) assays for rapid detection of some of the recently emerged human viral pathogens viz. West Nile, SARS, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, Norwalk, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian infl uenza (HPAI) viruses have been developed and evaluated ( Parida et al 2004 ( Parida et al , 2005 ( Parida et al , 2006 ( Parida et al , 2008 Hong et al 2005; Imai et al 2006; Toriniwa et al 2006) On comparison to conventional RT-PCR, RT-LAMP assay demonstrated 10 to 100 fold more sensitivity with a detection limit of 0.01 to 10 PFU of virus in all these cases. The usefulness of LAMP for amplifi cation of DNA viruses was also reported for HBV, HPV (human papillomavirus) type -6,11, 16 and 18, HSV, varivella zooster virus (VZV), cytomegalo virus (CMV) and found to be superior in terms of sensitivity, specifi city, rapidity, and simplicity, and can potentially be a valuable tool for the detection of HPV DNA compared to PCR and real-time PCR ( ",
