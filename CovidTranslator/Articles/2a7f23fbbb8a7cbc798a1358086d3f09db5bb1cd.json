Synthesis of minus-strand RNA from the artificial minigenome was determined by using Huh-7 cells harboring autonomously replicating HCV subgenome as a helper for provision of functional replication components. To further confirm and extend these studies, we investigated here whether the minigenome replication system could be reconstituted by transfection of na\u00efve Huh-7 cells with plasmid expressing nonstructural (NS) proteins. Reporter assay and Northern blot analysis revealed that trans-expression of NS proteins from 3 to 5 resulted in high level of luciferase activity and synthesized minus-strand RNA. The analogous result was also obtained with the minigenome derived from HCV 2a, and both HCV 1b-and 2a-derived NS protein were able to support the chimeric minigenomes whose 5 0 -or 3 0 -end was replaced by the respective region of the heterologous virus. These results provide a basis for establishing the reverse genetic system that is helpful to study cis-and trans-acting factors involved in HCV RNA replication.",

HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family with a positive-sense RNA genome of 9600 nucleotides in length. The genome is flanked by highly structured nontranslated regions (NTRs) important for both RNA translation and replication. The viral genome encodes a polyprotein precursor of approximately 3010 amino acids, which is processed by viral and cellular protease to produce the structural proteins (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (NS) proteins (p7 and NS2 to NS5B).",

Although the basic steps in replication have been well established, little is known about the detail of these processes. Studies of HCV replication have been hampered by the lack of an efficient tissue culture system. Although the development of subgenomic replicon has facilitated the investigation of viral RNA replication in cell culture [2] , culture-adaptive mutations within the NS proteins are required for efficient replication [3, 4] , and full-length genomes carrying such mutations do not produce infectious virus particles [5, 6] . More recently, it was reported that genotype 2a JFH1 genome replicates efficiently independent of the culture-adaptive mutations and supports production of viral particles [7] . This in vitro system, together with the later-developed JFH1-based 0006-291X/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2006. 10.188 chimeras [8, 9] , are an important progress in HCV research, allowing the study of unknown aspects of HCV life cycle. However, a comparison study showed that JFH1 differs from the earlier-generated HCV 1b replicon in independence of the cellular cofactor (cyclophilin B) for the replication and less sensitivity to antiviral reagent [10] , suggesting that the strain-or genotype-specific properties may exist and the observation obtained with JFH1 cannot be simply extrapolated to other isolates. Synthetic minigenomes have been described in a number of minus-and plus-stranded RNA viruses, which has contributed greatly to the analysis of cis-acting sequences and trans-acting proteins required for viral replication, maturation, and packaging [11, 12] . We previously established a helper virus-dependent expression system utilizing HCVderived minigenome, and Huh-7 cells harboring autonomously replicating HCV subgenome [13] . In this study, we further investigated whether the minigenome replication system could be reconstituted by transfection of na\u00efve Huh-7 cells with plasmid expressing NS proteins. It was shown that synthesis of minus-strand RNA from HCV minigenome can be supported by trans-expressed polyprotein NS3 to NS5B, and the NS proteins were able to replicate not only the homologous minigenome but the heterologous and chimeric minigenome as well.",

The cells were harvested at 3 days posttransfection, protein expression was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 ) and the replication of minigenome was determined by luciferase assay and Northern blot analysis. The firefly luciferase activity from cotransfected pGL3-Control vector was simultaneously measured to normalize the transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3A , only background level of Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activity was detected in cells transfected with the empty vector. Cotransfection of the plasmid encoding the polyprotein NS3 to NS5B (pNS3-51b) resulted in significant Renilla luciferase expression. Omission of pAM8-1 in the transfection mixture completely abrogated Renilla luciferase activity, largely ruling out the possibility that the minus-strand RNA used here as the mRNA for reporter gene expression was synthesized as a consequence of the transcription by a cryptic promoter. Consistent with the results reported previously [13] , Renilla luciferase activity was also detected in Huh-NNRZ cells stably replicating the HCV subgenomic replicon, although it was lower than that in cells trans-expressing the polyprotein. The fact that the replicase complex reconstituted by trans-expressed polyprotein could support more efficient replication of the minigenome may be attributable to the higher expression level of plasmid-encoded protein on a per-transfected-cell basis. Alternatively, the recruitment of the replication complex to the minigenome may be competed by the subgenomic replicon, because both of these share the replication machinery in replicon cells.",

These data demonstrate that trans-replication of HCV minigenome does not require replication of the helper viral RNA. To document that the reporter gene expression detected above was dependent on HCV replicase reconstituted by trans-expressed NS proteins, we employed inactive mutant pNS3-51b/dGDD (in which the GDD motif of NS5B was deleted) and AdsiNS5B expressing siRNA directed against NS5B [13] in the reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 3C , the deletion of GDD motif significantly attenuated the ability of NS proteins to support minigenome replication, and transduction with AdsiNS5B resulted in a substantial and dose-dependent reduction in luciferase expression. These results provide further evidence that the reporter gene was expressed as a result of replication of HCV minigenome by trans-supplied NS proteins.",

For this purpose, HCV minigenome from distantly related genotype 2a (Fig. 1B,  p2a-2a) , minigenomes with 5 0 -end deleted ( Fig. 1C and D, pnu-1b and pnu-2a), and chimeric minigenomes whose 5 0 -or 3 0 -end was replaced by the respective region of the heterologous virus ( Fig. 1E and F, p1b-2a and p2a-1b) were constructed. Huh-7 cells were transfected with these minigenomes together with the plasmid expressing HCV 1b-or 2a-derived NS proteins, pAM8-1, and Renilla luciferase activities were measured as fore-mentioned. Consistent with the results described above, replicase of HCV 1b and 2a accepted its respective minigenome as the template for synthesis of minus-strand RNA, and exchange of NS proteins between HCV1b-and 2a-derived minigenome systems also led to reporter gene expression (Fig. 4) , implying that the replication complex is not strictly specific for the homologous RNA template. Deletion of the 5 0 -end region in the minigenome fully abrogated its replication, both NS proteins from HCV 1b and 2a, however, could support the replication of chimeric minigenomes, suggesting that both RNA-protein interaction between replicase and viral genome and long range RNA-RNA interaction between 5 0 -and 3 0 -terminal sequence involved in HCV minus-strand RNA synthesis are functionally conserved between genotype 1b and 2a. Additionally, in all tested minigenomes, the NS proteins originated from HCV 1b constantly yielded higher levels of luciferase expression than that from 2a, suggesting that intrinsic differences in the replication capabilities of the replicase complex from different strains may exist. More likely, the superior capability of pNS3-51b in supporting the minigenomes replication may be attributable to the fact that the coding sequence in pNS3-51b was amplified from the replicon which harbors the adaptive mutations due to long-term culture, whereas the coding region in pNS3-52a was directly amplified from HCV 2a-infected serum.",

The rescue of synthetic minigenomes was achieved either through helper virus infection of minigenome-transfected cells with virus particles or through co-transfection of plasmids expressing viral proteins.

One scenario may make these two different findings compatible: the cis-expressed, lethally mutated NS proteins may exert dominant negative effect in reconstituting replication complex, and thus interfere with the incorporation of trans-supplied NS proteins into a functional replication complex, which may account for the failure of NS proteins (other than NS5A) to trans-complement HCV RNA replication; however, such a dominant negative effect does not exist in the minigenome system described here because there is no NS protein expressed in cis, and trans-expressed NS proteins might be able to reconstitute the functional replication complex to support minigenome replication.

The negative strand intermediates are postulated to exist as a dsRNA form. However, there is no direct evidence demonstrating this postulation in HCV, and whether there is free HCV-specific RNA of negative polarity in infected cells is still an issue to be elucidated. On the other hand, increasing evidence showed that the RNA in native replication intermediates of some positive strand RNA viruses is single-stranded. For example, in polio virus-infected cells, a careful electron microscope analysis using a membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent demonstrated that the native replication intermediate in vivo has a predominantly single-stranded backbone attached to several nascent RNA chains with few or no regions of extensive base-pairing, although deproteined (phenol-extracted) replication intermediate has a backbone mostly double-stranded [22] . More recently, Fujimura et al., reported that native replication intermediates of 20 S RNA virus have a singlestranded RNA backbone [23] . After completion of product-strand elongation, both the product and template strands are released from the replication complex as single-stranded RNA. The data presented here indicate that the minus strand RNA could serve as the mRNA for transgene expression, implying a similar scenario may also occur in HCV replication and minus strand RNA may be dissociated and present as a free single-strand form after RNA synthesis is completed.",

            "text": "One issue of concern in using minigenome to study the molecular mechanism of viral replication is whether the elements controlling viral replication in the context of minigenome could authentically reflect those that occurred in the context of full-length genome. Recently, differential effect of a point mutation in the replicase gene on genome and minigenome replication was reported in coronavirus, emphasizing the need to use full-length genome to validate the replication signals obtained from minigenome system [24] . Nonetheless, the HCV minigenome system described here represents a useful tool for identification of cis-and trans-acting factors involved in viral replication while eliminating biosafety constraints required for work with infectious systems. Additionally, it will be of interest to explore whether the HCV minigenome can be packaged by additional provision of the viral structural protein in trans, and its success will not only further broaden the 1bnu-2a1b-1b2a-2a 1b-2a2a-1bnu-1bnu-2a1b-1b2a-2a 1b-2a2a-1b Relative Rluc activity (100%) NS3-51b NS3-52a Fig. 4 . Replication of chimeric HCV minigenomes. Huh-7 cells were transfected with each indicated minigenome, pAM8-1, and pNS3-51b or pNS3-52a expressing polyprotein NS3 to NS5B derived from genotype 1b or 2a. Relative Renilla luciferase activities in the lysates were determined as described for Fig. 3A . The columns and bars represent means and standard deviations of three independent transfections. application of the HCV minigenome, but also facilitate the development of HCV-based gene delivery system. We describe here a reverse genetic system for HCV that is based on T7-driven minigenome coupled with plasmidencoded NS proteins. This system opens the possibility of manipulation of cis-acting signals and trans-acting factors involved in the control of HCV RNA synthesis, which may facilitate future studies aimed at investigation of the mechanisms involved in the replication of viral RNA.",
