Obvious examples of substances that can cause human diseases include infectious agents, poisons, chemicals and other noxious agents, drugs, and physical stimuli such as bright lights and loud sounds. Some less obvious agents can include allergens, nontangible agents such as colorless, odorless gases and aerosolized toxins. In recent decades, humans have developed various new materials and compounds. Additionally, we are now producing known compounds, and even naturally occurring substances, in vastly increased amounts. Many of these substances are generally believed to threaten the health of our environment. However, there is also a considerable amount of hype and exaggeration regarding some of these agents (e.g., mold) that is unsubstantiated. This article extensively reviews the data on a large number of airborne-related illnesses and attempted to place scientific reality in the context of clinical medicine.",

            "text": "One of the most widespread consequences of the use of new materials in ever more airtight buildings may be the so-called Sick Building Syndrome (SBS). SBS is a rather poorly defined term referring to a set of nonspecific skin, mucous membrane, neurological, respiratory, and generalized symptoms experienced by people working in nonindustrial environments in the absence of a known causative agent; these symptoms diminish or disappear during absences from these work environments (1) . These introductory comments are made with the understanding that the vast majority of so-called SBS outbreaks have been shown secondary to discrimination bias, secondary gain, or both. However, a number of important illnesses can occur in very air-tight buildings. With the recognition that such nonspecific symptoms are reported in almost all office buildings, as well as in schools, libraries, hospitals, homes for the elderly, and apartments, they are increasingly referred to as building-related symptoms. This can be somewhat misleading because the terms \"buildingrelated symptoms\" and \"building-related illness\" used to be reserved for symptoms with identified causes (2, 3) . Confusion can be avoided by distinguishing between nonspecific and specific building-related illnesses. For the sake of simplicity, we use the term SBS for the nonspecific symptomatology experienced by occupants of nonindustrial buildings.",

From a review of the literature, a multidisciplinary group of European scientists concluded that ventilation rate was strongly associated with perceived air quality, SBS symptoms, and various other health outcomes such as inflammation, infections, asthma, allergy, and short-term sick leave (5) . The data also showed that increased ventilation was associated with enhanced productivity. Previous reviews had indicated that there was an increased risk of adverse health effects at outdoor airflow rates lower than 10 L/s and that perceived air quality improved and SBS symptoms decreased with higher ventilation rates in most studies (6, 7) . The minimum ventilation rate set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers is 10 L/s per person. However, European scientists concluded that the risk of SBS symptoms increased at outdoor air-supply rates lower than 25 L/s per person (5) . Note that increasing the outdoor air supply can result in deteriora- tion of indoor air quality if outdoor pollutants are insufficiently filtered by the ventilation system (8) .",

However, CO 2 concentrations in occupied buildings usually do not reach steady state, and for this and various other reasons, CO 2 concentrations may not accurately reflect ventilation rates (6) . Nonetheless, the results of studies investigating the association of CO 2 concentrations with SBS symptoms are generally similar to those obtained with ventilation rates. Analysis of data from 41 of 100 US office buildings studied in the Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) undertaken by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicated a dose-response relationship between the average workday indoor minus average outdoor CO 2 concentrations (dCO 2 ) and sore throat, nose or sinus symptoms, tight chest, and wheezing (9) . The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) per 100 ppm dCO 2 ranged between 1.2 and 1.5. When the analysis was extended to the whole set of 100 buildings, however, many of the previously reported associations were not evident, and the ORs for sore throat and wheeze were reduced to 1.15 and 1.21, respectively (10) .",

It has long been suspected that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important contributors to SBS, but conclusive evidence is lacking. The VOCs may not be responsible for the SBS symptoms; rather, the products of their reaction with ozone and other chemicals may trigger the symptoms. Ultrafine particles, which can act as strong airway irritants, are one example of these reaction products. Particulate matter (PM) from various sources is another possible causative agent of SBS symptoms, especially because it has been associated with respiratory symptoms in healthy and asthmatic subjects.",

These other exposures include persistent organochlorine compounds that were widely produced and used in the 1960s and 1970s, before researchers realized that they accumulated in the environment and in various biota to the extent that they caused serious adverse effects on wildlife and humans. Their permanence ensures that humans will be exposed to them for generations to come.

However, levels of these compounds in office and other buildings are considerably lower than those found in industrial settings. Concentrations of total VOC (TVOC) in office buildings commonly range between less than 100 \u00b5g/m 3 and several thousand micrograms per cubic meter, but maximum values of up to 50,000 \u00b5g/m 3 have been reported (11, 12) . More than 350 VOCs have been detected at concentrations exceeding 1 ppb in indoor air (3) , but generally only about 30 to 70 are routinely measured and even fewer are consistently detected in a majority of office buildings (12) (13) (14) (15) . When a group of Nordic scientists reviewed the literature up to early 1996 regarding VOC/ TVOC and health, they concluded that neither exposure nor epidemiological studies provided conclusive evidence that TVOC provided a risk index for health and comfort effects in buildings (11) . A similar conclusion was reached in a review of studies that examined the association between SBS symptoms and indoor airborne PM, to which VOC can be adsorbed (16) . However, the Nordic scientists stated that indoor air pollution, including VOCs, was most likely causally linked to effects on health and comfort. They also emphasized that there were \"problems of principle with the concept of TVOC as such\" because it is poorly definedthat is, it refers to different mixtures of chemicals with varying biological effects and is used in an unsystematic manner. Additionally, the use of various different sampling and analytical methods constitutes a major source of variability between studies (17) .",

Additionally, symptoms are generally assessed via questionnaires, and these differ between studies and are not always validated. The period for which symptoms are assessed also varies from the single day on which environmental measurements are taken to as long as the previous year. In several studies, there is a considerable lapse of time between these measurements and the assessment of symptoms. The number and type of factors included as covariates or confounders in the statistical analysis also varies substantially between studies.

Although rather different half-lives of elimination have been reported for VOCs from blood, there is general agreement that VOCs are rapidly taken up and that their elimination is characterized by a two-exponential, and in some cases a three-exponential, equation (39) . This suggests that blood VOCs are distributed to multiple tissues for storage and that the kinetics of elimination vary with the storage site. This is confirmed by measurements of VOCs in breath, which suggest that under steadystate conditions, the residence times for blood",

Importantly, residential formaldehyde exposure has been associated with inflammation of the lower respiratory tract as well as asthma and other lower respiratory tract symptoms in children and adults. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (NO), which is believed to represent a marker of pulmonary inflammation, were found to be significantly higher in healthy children age 6 to 13 yr who were exposed to residential concentrations of formaldehyde of 50 ppb (62 mg/m 3 ) or greater compared to those exposed to levels less than 50 ppb (63) . The technique used in this study ensured that the exhaled NO originated from the lower respiratory tract. This suggests that formaldehyde exposure may have induced an inflammatory response, even in children without signs or symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract disease.",

This was at least partly confirmed by a Finnish study of VOCs that combined personal exposure assessment with measurements in residential and work environments (46) . ETS was found to be a dominant source of personal VOC exposure. In ETS-free homes, variability in VOC exposure stemmed from compounds associated with cleaning products, followed by compounds associated with traffic emissions, long-range Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 transport of pollutants, and product emissions (74) .

Recently, the detection of several phthalate metabolites was reported in human breast milk, indicating that oral exposure can begin immediately after birth (83) . Additionally, direct intravenous exposure occurs in patients undergoing dialysis or receiving blood transfusions.",

The monoesters of phthalates with higher molecular weights, such as DEHP, di-n-octyl phthalate, and di-isononyl phthalate, undergo rather extensive \u03c9-1 and \u03c9-oxidation of their aliphatic sidechains (88, 89) .

There is growing evidence that some secondary oxidative metabolites of DEHP, such as mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (5-OH-MEHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5oxohexyl) phthalate (5-oxo-MEHP), are present in urine in considerably higher concentrations than mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) (4.5-and 3.5-fold higher, respectively; refs. 88,89, and 93; see also Table 6 ). They and other recently identified metabolites may constitute more sensitive biomarkers of exposure to DEHP (94, 95) . Extrapolation of daily phthalate intake from urinary excretion of their metabolites is hampered by several factors. Urinary phthalate metabolite levels have been found to vary with the time of sample collection (92, 96) . Furthermore, substantial within-subject variability has been observed, and researchers have calculated that up to four samples obtained 1 to 3 mo apart may be necessary to classify exposure with a reliability of 80% (97, 98) . Another difficulty in estimating daily phthalate intakes from urinary excretion of their metabolites is the limited availability of fractional excretion data. This is illustrated by the vast differences (10.3 vs 1.76 \u00b5g/kg/d) in the estimates of median daily DEHP intake obtained using the same data but different assumptions of the fractional excretion of MEHP (99, 100) . Note that if the higher estimate were correct, up to 31% of the metabolite values would yield intake estimates exceeding the reference dose (RfD) of 20 \u00b5g/ kg of body weight/d set by the US EPA, and 12% of intake estimates would exceed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) value of 37 \u00b5g/kg/d set by the corresponding European Union agency.

Findings suggestive of enhanced sensitization have also been reported in humans, but the activity pattern of phthalates was quite distinct. Specifically, results from a Swedish case-control study indicated a significant association between physiciandiagnosed rhinitis or eczema and BBzP in dust from the child's bedroom, whereas DEHP was associated with physician-diagnosed asthma, and DEP showed no association with either disease (ref. 109; see Table 4 for phthalate concentrations in dust). The association of individual phthalates with different symptom outcomes may be a reflection of their different physical properties, including vapor pressures, polarities, and octanol/air partition coefficients. Notably, median concentration of DEHP and BBzP were significantly higher in bedrooms with PVC flooring, and a correlation between PVC flooring and case status was also observed in this study, although it was weaker than the associations observed with DEHP and BBzP. This confirms the results of an earlier case-control study that indicated an association of PVC flooring and other plasticizer-containing surfaces with bronchial obstruction in 2-yr-old children in Oslo (110) . The association was found to be considerably stronger in children from homes with low air exchange rates compared with those with high air exchange rates, suggesting that chemical compounds in the vapor phase or adsorbed to suspended particles were involved in the observed associations (111) . In a previous study by these investigators, DEHP and BBzP concentrations in sedimented dust and suspended PM were highly correlated (86) . Dust has been shown to increase the DEHP emission rate from PVC floors and its deposition on internal surfaces (112) . In addition to PVC floors, the amount of plastic wall materials was found to be associated with persistent wheezing, cough, and phlegm in a cross-sectional study of children age 1 to 7 yr (113) .",

There were significant negative associations between mono-n-butyl pthalate (MBP) and forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume after 1 s (FEV 1 ), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in males only. The effect on FVC was essentially confined to nonsmoking males. An association between monoethyl phthalate and lower FVC and FEV 1 was also observed only in males. Conversely, in nonsmoking women, FEV 1 and maximum midexpiratory flow correlated positively with MEHP concentrations. Under alkaline conditions, DEHP is degraded into MEHP and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, and the latter is reportedly used in Sweden as an indicator of alkaline degradation of DEHP (115) . A geometric mean 2-ethyl-1-hexanol concentration of 2.47 \u00b5g/m 3 was reported in Finnish homes, and the geometric mean personal exposure was only slightly higher (2.63 \u00b5g/m 3 ; ref. 46 ) and similar to the geometric mean of 3.0 \u00b5g/m 3 reported for a German population (116) . Findings suggestive of an association between one or both of the DEHP breakdown products, MEHP and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, with an increased prevalence of self-reported and objective ocular and nasal symptoms have been reported in workers at four Swedish hospitals (115) .",

Whereas some recent research have failed to find direct or indirect evidence of alterations in Sertoli structure and function (118, 124, 128) , cell-specific immunohistochemistry has revealed that maturation of Sertoli cells was incomplete in male fetuses exposed to DBP starting at GD 13 (121) . During fetal development, Sertoli cells secrete paracrine factors that are essential for the differentiation and testosterone production of Leydig cells. Therefore, the immaturity of Sertoli cells and resulting disturbances in Sertoli-Leydig cell signaling could explain the marked reduction in testosterone synthesis by fetal Leydig cells. Such decreased testosterone production is frequently seen in conjunction with Leydig cell hyperplasia (121, 128, 132, 134) . This has been suggested to constitute a compensatory mechanism to maintain testosterone output (132) . Alternatively, the reduced testosterone and Insl3 production after gestational exposure to phthalates could delay Leydig cell maturation and differentiation, thereby prolonging their proliferation and resulting in hyperplasia (126) .",

In some cases, this was accompanied by immunohistochemical analysis of changes in protein expression. Interestingly, the phthalates known to be reproductive toxicants all induced very similar alterations in gene expression, whereas no significant changes were observed after exposure to the nondevelopmentally toxic phthalates (135) . Consistently with the previously observed decrease in testicular testosterone production, the genes and gene pathways involved in steroidogenesis and cholesterol homeostasis and transport were found to be major targets Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 and were all downregulated (127, 131, 134, 135) . The effects of DBP on the expression of genes involved in cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis were dose-dependent, with significant reductions in mRNA levels of scavenger receptor B type 1 and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase observed at doses of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg/d, respectively (127) . Conversely, several genes regulating cell proliferation and survival were upregulated (127, 131, 134, 136) , which is consistent with the observed Leydig cell hyperplasia. Other targeted genes and gene pathways included \u03b1-inhibin, which is essential for normal Sertoli cell development and insulin signaling (135) . Within the Wolffian duct, exposure to DBP from GDs 15 to 19 or 21 altered the expression of genes within the insulin-like growth factor pathway and other developmentally important signaling pathways as well as genes for extracellular matrix components (137) . These findings suggest a model in which prenatal DBP exposure disrupts orchestrated molecular responses between epithelia, mesenchyme, and extracellular matrix, thereby altering Wolffian duct morphology. These alterations are likely to be secondary to decreased testosterone synthesis but could also be mediated more directly.",

After oral exposure, gut lipases and esterases hydrolyze phthalate esters into their more easily absorbable monoesters. Pronounced interspecies differences exist in lipase activity, with primates exhibiting much lower activity than rats and having correspondingly lower dose-normalized monoester levels (77) . Consequently, a default risk assessment, consisting of the lowest observed adverse effect level multiplied by default factors of 10 each for interspecies and interindividual differences, was deemed inappropriate (139) . A recent direct comparison confirmed that oral treatment with equal doses of DEHP per unit of body weight resulted in up to 7.5 times lower peak concentrations of MEHP in marmosets than in rats (140) . Normalized areas under the curve were up to 16 times lower in the primates. However, a human volunteer who consumed an almost 50-foldlower dose of DEHP (0.65 mg/kg) than the lowest dose used in the study of marmosets and rats (30 mg/kg) had a similar C max of MEHP (2.5 mg/L compared with 2.7 mg/L in marmosets) (94) . Additionally, the dose-normalized area under the curve for this volunteer was at least 15 times higher than in the rats and almost 100 times higher than in the marmosets. Although this is only based on a single individual, it certainly does not suggest that human tissues are exposed to lower concentrations of MEHP than rats after the same dose of DEHP.",

Conversely, in humans, the majority of phthalate monoesters and even the secondary metabolites are present in urine in the form of glucuronides (89, 90) . In serum, the metabolites Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 (at least of MEHP) were reported to be mostly conjugated (89) , but this is in marked contrast to the findings from a single human volunteer (142) . Note that this volunteer had ingested a high dose of DEHP, and researchers recently showed that, at least in urine, free MEHP made up 3% of total MEHP at the 50th percentile concentration but made up almost 87% at the 95th percentile (141) . This correlation was not statistically significant for MEHP, but there was a linear increase in the percentage of free monoethyl phthalate (MEP), MBP, and monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) in urine with increasing total forms. This could indicate that the difference between the findings in a single volunteer and those of the larger study resulted from the higher dose the volunteer ingested. However, it could also be a reflection of variability in phthalate metabolism, because substantial interindividual variation has been reported in the degree of conjugation (141) .",

In adult men, urinary MEP levels were found to be associated with DNA damage in sperm (as measured by the comet assay), whereas MEHP, MBzP, MBP, and monomethyl phthalate were not (145) . There was an inverse and dose-dependent relation between urinary MBP concentrations and sperm motility and between MBzP Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 and MBP levels and sperm concentration (146) . None of the other phthalate metabolites detectable in at least 75% of the urine samples, (i.e., MEHP, monoethyl, and monomethyl phthalate) were significantly associated with sperm parameters. Changes in reproductive hormone levels were also observed, but several of them exhibited unexpected patterns and directions (96) . For example, inhibin B is secreted by Sertoli cells, and because MBP disrupts Sertoli structure and function, it was surprising that inhibin B increased with higher MBP exposure, whereas follicle-stimulating hormone did not increase. Higher MBzP exposure was associated with a decrease in follicle-stimulating hormone, but there was no change in inhibin B levels.",

Accordingly, the IARC reclassified DEHP from \"possible carcinogen to humans\" to \"non-classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans\" (148) . However, the US EPA classified DEHP as a probable human carcinogen. The decision by the IARC has been harshly criticized for allegedly not giving due consideration to all of the available scientific evidence, particularly experimental and epidemiological evidence suggesting that DEHP induces pancreatic tumors in rodents and possibly humans (149, 150) . A recent addition to that database is a chronic feeding study in Sprague-Dawley rats, in which exposure to DEHP at a dose of 300 mg/kg/d significantly increased the incidence not only of liver tumors but also that of testicular tumors (147) . Although lower doses (30 or 95 mg/kg/ d) did not significantly increase the incidence of Leydig cell tumors, there was a significant trend for increasing neoplasias with increasing dose.",

When chlorine/hypochlorites (2.5 billion pounds), wood preservatives, and specialty biocides were included, total usage in the United States alone was almost five billion pounds. At least 75% of this amount is used in agriculture, and home and garden use and commercial/industrial/government use almost equally share the remaining 20 to 25%. Between 80 and 90% of households have reported indoor use of pesticides (151, 152) . Of particular concern, 70 and 85% of pregnant women from two New York City cohorts, respectively, reported the indoor use of pesticides during pregnancy (153, 154) , and 37% employed an exterminator (154) . The use of organophosphate (OP) insecticides declined from approx 131 million pounds in 1980 to 73 million pounds in 2001, but its percentage among total insecticides increased from 58 to 70% in the same period.

Pharmacokinetics studies in human volunteers Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 have indicated that OPs are readily absorbed after oral administration and are quickly metabolized to more polar metabolites, which are then eliminated in urine with half-lives ranging from 2 h for orally administered diazinon to up to 27 h for chlorpyrifos (155) (156) (157) (158) . Limited absorption was observed from occluded dermal doses, and urinary elimination halflives were longer than after oral administration (9 h for diazinon, 27-30 h for chlorpyrifos) (155, 157, 158) . Approximately 60% of diazinon and 70 to 93% of chlorpyrifos were recovered as urinary metabolites (155, 157, 158) . Only 1 to 3% of the dose was recovered for any of the OP pesticides investigated after dermal application (155, 157, 158) . Under the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, an assessment is required for cumulative risks from food, water, and nonoccupational exposure resulting from all uses of OPs and should account for exposure to multiple pesticides that have a common mode of toxicological action and end point of toxicity. The Food Quality Protection Act further requires that infants and children are given particular attention because their higher food and fluid intake per body mass, different diets, and behavior put them at risk of higher exposure. Additionally, the immaturity of the detoxifying enzyme system in small infants and the extensive growth and development that young children undergo renders them more vulnerable to the potential hormonal/endocrine disrupting, neurotoxic, immunotoxic, and/or carcinogenic effects of OP pesticides and other environmental pollutants (152, 159) .",

All of the measured values vary considerably, but it is difficult to determine whether they reflect mostly methodological differences or represent true differences in pesticide concentrations. Note that many of the available studies have focused on chlorpyrifos and diazinon. The US EPA eliminated essentially all indoor residential uses of these pesticides by 2002, but they continue to be used in agriculture.",

Mean aggregate chlorpyrifos exposure from a total of six pathways was calculated to be 1.39 \u00b5g/d (standard deviation: 2.77 \u00b5g/d); inhalation made the greatest contribution (approx 85%), whereas only between 7 and 13% was attributable to pesticide residues in solid food, and the dermal route was negligible (172, 173) . In two studies of children's pesticide exposure, however, solid food made the greatest contribution to the cumulative intake of chlorpyrifos, malathion, and diazinon (84, 163) . Interestingly, despite the high contribution that food appeared to make to aggregate chlorpyrifos exposure in the Minnesota Children's Pesticide Exposure Study, there was a much stronger correlation between urinary metabolites of this pesticide and concentrations in personal air than with levels in the ingested solid food (163) . Additionally, note that the estimates of dermal absorption neglected to account for the volatilized portion of chlorpyrifos. The finding of a high correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.998) between chlorpyrifos in indoor air and in the corresponding dermal wipes suggests that this route of exposure may be important (57) .",

Additionally, it cannot be determined whether and to what extent urinary metabolites represent exposure to one or more parent compounds or direct exposure to their metabolites.

Recently, the association between prenatal OP pesticide exposure and neonatal neurodevelopment as assessed by the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale was investigated in 381 full-term infants in the CHAMACOS project. Table 11 includes maternal DAP metabolite levels during pregnancy in this cohort of women, which contained a substantial portion of agricultural workers from the Salinas Valley and other women with rather high environmental exposure to pesticides because of their heavy use in this agricultural center. Total, dimethyl, and diethyl DAP in urine were all significantly associated with an increased number of abnormal reflexes (failure to respond or hypoactive response) and the proportion of neonates with more than three abnormal reflexes (197) . Interestingly, the association differed depending on the age at which the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale was administered. The association was negative in neonates examined after age 3 d but was unexpectedly positive in infants assessed within the first 3 d of life (n = 197) .",

In the CHAMACOS cohort, DAP metabolites were associated with a significant increase in head circumference and a marginally significant increase in birth length (199) . Only dimethyl phosphate, and not DEP, metabolites and cord cholinesterase activity were significantly associated with decreased length of gestational duration. In marked contrast, in a cohort of African-American and Dominican women from New York, cord blood concentrations of chlorpyrifos were a significant independent predictor of decreased birth weight and birth length (200) . Ethnic-specific regressions indicated that the effect on birth weight was statistically significant only among African-American women, whereas the effect on birth length was significant only in Dominican women. An extension of this study confirmed the significant association between cord plasma chlorpyrifos and diazinon levels and decreased birth weight and length in a somewhat larger cohort, but it was unable to detect an association with insecticide concentrations in maternal personal air during pregnancy (201) . Notably, although the associations between cord plasma Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 concentrations of chlorpyrifos and diazinon were highly significant in children born before the US EPA started to phase out residential use of these pesticides, they were no longer detected in children born after.

Similar results were obtained 24 h after Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 administration of 1 or 10 mg/kg of parathion and 0.75 or 75 mg/kg of diazinon, although only the higher doses inhibited AChE (218) .

These broncho-obstructive effects were demonstrated to depend on the biotransformation of parathion by P450 enzymes.

Many OCs-particularly the more heavily chlorinated ones-resist biotic and abiotic degradation and are lipophilic; therefore, they not only bioaccumulate in all parts of the environment, but are bioconcentrated from one trophic level to the next.",

Historical global production of PCBs is conservatively estimated at 1.3 million tons, which were used almost exclusively in the Northern hemisphere (222) . Emissions (i.e., releases into the environment) of PCBs were estimated to be in the range of 440 and 92,000 tons (223) , and other data strongly have suggested that actual emissions were closer to the upper estimate (224, 225) .

However, the precise nature of the mixture depends on various factors such as solubility, volatility, and rates of degradation as well as dietary and other lifestyle factors and geographic location. For the purposes of risk assessment and regulatory action, the concept of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs; i.e., potency factors relative to TCDD) has been developed (226) . It is based on evidence that PCDDs, PCDFs, and certain PCBs exert their toxicity via binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and subsequent induction of gene expression, particularly of various cytochrome P450 isozymes. The TEF concept assumes that the combined effects of these OCs can be predicted by a model of concentration addition. TEF values can then be used to calculate toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations by multiplying the concentrations of each PCDD, PCDF, or PCB by its TEF. Commonly, either the World Health Organization (WHO) TEQs or the international TEQs (I-TEQs) developed by the NATO are used.",

Sea mammals are predators at the top of their food chains and contain very high levels of OCs.

For all congeners, including some of the most commonly detected, the 50th percentile was lower than the limit of detection (LOD). For a surprising number of congeners, even the 95th percentile was lower than the LOD. For PCBs 118, 138, 153, and 180, the 75th percentile values were 13.1, lower than LOD, lower than LOD, and 37.4 ng/g of lipid, respectively. Similar data from other studies are not directly comparable because they were not population-based, were obtained by different analytical methods, and were not always on blood lipid base. Nonetheless, it is striking that some of these studies detected PCBs 138 and 153 in a high percentage of subjects. For example, despite similar detection limits as those reported in the Centers for Disease Control study, PCBs 138 and 153 were detected in 93 and 97%, respectively, of umbilical cord plasma samples obtained from neonates born to Canadian women living in southern Qu\u00e9bec and exposed to background levels of PCB (261) . The geometric mean values were 12.7 and 16.9 ng/g of plasma lipids, respectively. In blood samples from German schoolchildren obtained between 1996 and 2003, all 5th percentile values for PCBs 138, 153, and 180 were above the detection limit (244) . (261) (262) (263) , and neonatal levels of PCBs have been found to increase with length of gestation in full-term neonates born after 38 to 42 wk of gestation (264) . The detection of OCs in amniotic fluid and meconium samples has also been reported (179, 265) , further confirming that OC exposure starts in utero.",

Notably, elimination rates for TCDD appear to depend on age (286) and body fat (283) and are believed to slow with decreasing body burden (287) (288) (289) . OCs are primarily excreted in the bile (272, 290) . Lactation can also represent a major route of excretion. The high levels of OCs found in breast milk indicate that OCs are mobilized from adipose tissue during lactation, and significant decreases in the maternal body burden of PCDD/Fs and PCBs with simultaneous accumulation in their infants has been observed, particularly following the first delivery (291, 292) .",

            "text": "Much of the knowledge of the health effects of OCs comes from highly exposed occupational cohorts and from Air Force personnel involved in the spraying of Agent Orange in Vietnam. Additionally, there are three cohorts that experienced high levels of environmental exposure. Because of an industrial accident in Seveso, Italy, the air and soil from surrounding areas were contaminated mostly with TCDD. Two industrial accidents in Japan and Taiwan Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 resulted in the contamination of cooking oil, primarily with PCBs and PCDFs. The resulting symptoms were referred to as Yusho in Japan and Yu-Cheng in Taiwan (meaning \"oil disease\"). Table 13 provides brief descriptions of these cohorts. There should be a note of caution in interpreting epidemiological studies that analyze associations between exposures to OC compounds and various health effects. Generally, either PCBs or PCDD/Fs, but not both groups of compounds, have been measured in these studies. However, humans are invariably exposed to mixtures of these and other OC compounds, and the contributions of the individual components of the mixture to the effect under investigation are unknown. Additionally, several studies of OC tissue levels in North America and Europe found modest-to-strong correlations not only between total PCBs and PCDD/Fs but also among and between individual PCBs and PCDD/Fs (254, 259, (293) (294) (295) (296) (297) . Together, these factors can result in not only considerable confounding but in misclassifications of the observed effects (294) . This is most clearly illustrated by the fact that some PCB congeners are dioxin-like and, similar to dioxins, exert most of their effects through the Ah receptor, whereas others act as Ah receptor antagonists. Developmental neurotoxicities represent an example of an effect to which both Ah receptor-mediated mechanisms and mechanisms that are not Ah receptor-mediated are likely to contribute.",

A less consistent, but significant, increase in the OR of being small for gestational age was also observed (312) . The reduction in birth weight of children born to mothers who frequently consumed more Great Lakes sport-caught fish compared to children of mothers who rarely consumed contaminated fish was also associated with higher maternal serum DDE levels but not PCB levels (313) . However, such effects of DDE have not been observed in studies of more recent cohorts, suggesting that they may no longer occur at current exposure levels (238, 314, 315) .",

            "text": "The possible neurodevelopmental toxicities of PCBs and PCDD/Fs are one of the major concerns regarding environmental background exposure to OCs and are the focus of much ongoing research. Gestational exposure of rodents and monkeys to PCBs is consistently found to have negative effects on learning as well as locomotor activity and function (221) . In the Taiwanese Yu-Cheng incident, exposed mothers reported a delay in 32 of 33 developmental milestones in their children who were born up to 7 yr following the poisoning (317). The exposed children also scored consistently lower than controls on several formal cognitive and behavioral tests, with the exception of the verbal IQ on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (317, 329) . Similar levels of exposure to PCBs that were not contaminated by PCDFs were associated with markedly less toxicity, thus implicating the PCDFs or other thermal breakdown products present in the contaminated cooking oil in the observed neurodevelopmental effects (317) . Children in the Japanese rice oil poisoning were not formally tested but were reported to exhibit hypotony, hyperactivity, and altered latencies and amplitudes of auditory evoked potentials and were reported to have lower mean intelligence quotients (221) . Table 14 summarizes the associations of neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants and children with the PCB exposure levels of their mothers. Several methodological aspects greatly hamper comparison of the results. One of the difficulties is that different specimens (maternal serum or plasma, maternal milk, cord serum plasma) were used for exposure assessment, and the results were expressed per wet-weight or per gram lipid of the respective tissues. Additionally, the earlier studies measured PCBs by the packed column gas chromatography method and did not quantitate individual congeners, whereas in more recent studies, various combinations of individual congeners were measured. Longnecker et al. (330) used a variety of approaches to re-express the reported PCB concentrations as median PCB 153 levels in nanogram per gram of lipid in maternal serum for six of these cohorts (257, 299, 314, 331, 332) as well as for four other cohorts for which data on neurological testing are not yet available. These calculated PCB 153 concentrations are included in Table 14 . The use of PCB 153 for this purpose is appropriate because PCB 153 is highly correlated with total PCBs. Although substantial uncertainty arises from the assumptions that were made to convert packed-column into high-resolution results and milk into serum levels, the authors felt that the primary findings were not be substantially altered. These primary findings demonstrated substantial overlap in the distribution of exposure in the majority of studies, but the median exposure in the Faroe Islands was fourfold higher than the overall median.",

Despite the much greater transfer of OCs from the mother to the infant via breast milk, most studies have not revealed any significant associations between postnatal exposure via breastfeeding and neurodevelopmental outcomes (331, (333) (334) (335) . The exceptions are discussed here. The strongest and most persistent adverse effects were observed in the Michigan cohort, which included mothers who frequently consumed PCB-contaminated sports-caught fish from Lake Michigan (331, 333, (336) (337) (338) . Notably, the early developmental findings in the Michigan cohort have essentially been replicated in the Oswego cohort, which also included mothers who had consumed substantial amounts of sport-caught fish from Lake Ontario (334, (339) (340) (341) . The only difference was that studies of the Michigan cohort indicated a weak, but statistically significant, association between maternal fish consumption and performance on the Fagan test (preference for novelty), whereas such an association was not found in the Oswego cohort (334) . However, the effect size in the Oswego cohort was considerably smaller than reported for the Lake Michigan cohort (2.1 and 1.4% at 6 and 12 mo, respectively, vs 10.4% at 7 mo), which might be attributable to the lower levels of PCB and other contaminants in the Lake Ontario mothers compared with the Oswego mothers. However, note that the estimated PCB 153 concentrations in the Michigan cohort were similar to those observed in the Dutch cohort and were somewhat lower compared with the German cohort (330) . In the German cohort, no effect of prenatal PCB exposure was found using either the Fagan test or Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) (257, 298) . However, early postnatal PCB exposure (PCBs in early breast milk samples) showed a significant negative association with the Bayley II mental, but not psychomotor, developmental index at age 7 mo (298) . Negative associations between the PCB concentration in milk and mental and motor development (as assessed with the BSID) were only of borderline significance at age 7 and 18 mo but became highly significant in 30-mo-old children in that cohort (257) . Mental development continued to be negatively affected by lactational PCB exposure at age 42 mo (as assessed by the Kaufmann Assessment Battery for Children). In the Rotterdam cohort, postnatal PCB and dioxin exposure via breastfeeding was also negatively correlated with BSID scores at age 7 mo (263). Conversely to the German findings, this study also demonstrated an effect from prenatal exposure. In further contrast to the results from the German cohort, it was the psychomotor, but not the mental, development index that was significantly decreased, and the associations were no longer significant at age 18 mo.",

Both of these mechanisms are likely to contribute to the decreased plasma levels and reduced availability of T4 and T3 observed in experimental animals. Reductions in brain T4 concentrations have also been reported, but brain T3 levels are frequently unaffected, suggesting the existence of effective compensatory mechanisms. In utero exposure to single PCB congeners was associated with reduced plasma T4 levels in rat pups, and reduced T4 levels were also observed in wildlife species. Results of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are inconsistent. Learning and behavioral deficits as well as reductions in auditory evoked potentials have been observed in rodents and monkeys perinatally exposed to PCBs. These manifestations resemble Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 those induced by fetal hypothyroidism, but a causal link between the neurodevelopmental and the thyroid effects of PCB exposure cannot be established using the available data. High levels of environmental exposure to OCs (as experienced by Inuit and other coastal populations in which the traditional diet includes fish and the meat and blubber of sea mammals) have also been reported to affect neonatal thyroid hormone status. In a comparison of various populations in the Qu\u00e9bec province, concentrations of total PCBs (49 congeners) and total OH-PCBs (15 congeners) in cord blood both showed significant negative correlations with TSH concentrations but were not associated with levels of T3 or free T4 (279) .

Thyroxine-binding globulin was not significantly different at birth and at age 1 wk but was significantly higher in the group with high exposure at age 11 wk. Notably, the more highly exposed children in this cohort had significantly fewer suboptimal scores on the Hempel test of neuromotor functioning, suggesting enhanced maturation (349) . The authors hypothesized that this could result from the thyroxine agonist activity of dioxins.

PM 10 consists of fine particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 \u00b5m (PM 2.5 ) and coarse particles (PM 2.5-10 ), and the contribution of PM 2.5 to PM 10 was relatively constant in a given area but varied between 35 and 80% by region (356) . In 1997, the EPA proposed standards for PM 2.5 (see also Table 15 ). PM 2.5 can be further divided into nucleation mode or ultrafine particles (UFPs) with an aerodynamic diameter less than 0.1 \u00b5m and accumulation mode particles (approx 0.1-1 \u00b5m). Whereas measurements of larger particles are commonly based on their mass concentration, UFPs have very little mass but comprise the vast majority of the total number of particles.

Based on the once valid assumption that black smoke originated mostly from burning coal, the OECD defined a standard of converting reflectance of these black soot particles into mass concentration. These standards are no longer appropriate because coal burning has decreased considerably in most industrialized countries over recent decades. Today, an estimated 60 to 90% of the atmospheric EC content is produced by diesel-powered vehicles. It is estimated that more than 80% of diesel exhaust particles have an aerodynamic diameter of 1 \u00b5m or less (360) . Nonetheless, compared with purely gravimetric methods, measuring reflectance has the major advantage of providing some important information on the composition of particles.",

This large variability results from the fact that the fraction of indoor PM derived from outdoor sources depends on various factors. These factors include particle penetration efficiency, particle deposition rate, air exchange rate, and the extent of particle generation during indoor activities of the residents, which, in turn, are subject to circadian and seasonal variation (363, (366) (367) (368) . The penetration efficiency of outdoor particles has been found to be close to one independent of particle size, indicating that building shells essentially do not filter particles nor do they provide protection from inhalation exposure to ambient PM (363, 366, 367) . However, the effective penetration efficiency or infiltration efficiency (defined as the equilibrium fraction of ambient PM that penetrates indoors and remains suspended) depends on particle size because larger particles have higher deposition rates, whereas resuspension involves almost exclusively particles greater than 1 \u00b5m (366) (367) (368) .",

Considerable generation of particles also occurs during cooking and certain cleaning activities; vacuuming and the overall movement of people resuspend particles and contribute to indoor concentrations (363, 366, 374, 375) . Notably, one of these studies has provided evidence that terpeneozone reactions can result in pronounced eleva-tions in fine particles and UFPs (375) . As previously discussed, the products of terpene-O 3 reactions have been shown to act as strong airway irritants (32, 33) . ETS results in elevated particle counts in all size ranges, but appears to more strongly affect the size fraction smaller than 1.0 \u00b5m (376) . Cooking is one of the major indoor sources of UFP, with frying, toasting, baking, and barbecuing generating particles mostly in the ranges of 0.02 to 0.1 \u00b5m and 0.1 to 0.5 \u00b5m (357, 370, 375) . Saut\u00e9ing produces particles both in the ultrafine and coarse modes (2.5-10 \u00b5m). Although dusting, vacuuming, and walking constitute important sources of PM 2.5 , they predominantly raise the concentrations of coarse particles (357, 375) . Note that indoor particle events are brief and intermittent and not only have a pronounced effect on the size distribution of particles but can also raise particle number concentrations up to 100-fold and can result in peak mass concentrations that are several orders of magnitude higher than the values obtained from time-integrated samples (375) .",

            "text": "Tables 16 and 17 summarize the results of recent studies that measured indoor, outdoor, and personal exposure levels to PM 10 and PM 2.5 . These data highlight that there are considerable regional differences in ambient concentrations of particulate air pollution not only worldwide but also within the United States. They further show that for both PM 10 and PM 2.5 , personal exposure frequently exceeds residential indoor and residential and/or ambient outdoor concentrations, and in many of these studies, residential indoor levels are also elevated compared with those measured outdoors. Consequently, personal exposure can exceed Ambient Air Quality Standards in a substantial portion of the population, even if outdoor concentrations meet the standards (366) . The excess personal PM exposure compared with indoor and outdoor PM concentrations is referred to as the \"personal cloud.\" There is still uncertainty regarding the factors that contribute to this excess, but ETS, cooking, cleaning, and other indoor activities are all important (377, 378) . Other microenvironmental exposures-particularly traveling in vehicles-also significantly contribute (376, 378, 379) . Personal exposure overall is predicted by ETS and, in its absence, by residential indoor concentrations, followed by work environment concentrations and traffic density in the nearest street from home (371, 380, 381) . Outdoor PM 2.5 levels only predicted personal exposure in models that excluded residential and workplace indoor concentrations (371) . This is consistent with the results of most crosssectional studies, which indicate that the correlation between personal and outdoor PM levels is weak to moderate (365, 369, 382) . Considerably stronger correlations have been reported from most longitudinal studiesespecially in the absence of ETS exposure (380, (383) (384) (385) (386) -even in elderly subjects who spend an even greater percentage of their time indoors and at home (387) . Correlations between personal and indoor particulate levels are frequently stronger, even in cross-sectional studies (369, 382, 388) . However, note that the strength, magnitude, and even direction of the associations vary considerably among individuals (384, 385) .",

This entails that local deposition dose can greatly exceed the average dose of the entire lung. Whereas fine and coarse particles deposit by gravitational sedimentation and inertial impaction, diffusion is the predominant mechanism of deposition of particles for the UFP range and up to a diameter of approx 0.3 to 0.5 \u00b5m. Peak deposition of UFP was observed in a volumetric lung region corresponding to the transition zone between the conducting airways and alveolar regions (394) . Similarly, autopsy studies of lung tissue from subjects who had lived in areas with high particulate air pollution have indicated that tissue retention of fine particles is mostly observed in this transition zone (395) . There is some evidence that UFPs are not necessarily retained in the lung but can diffuse directly into the systemic circulation (396) .",

            "text": "In healthy subjects, the magnitude of the total deposition fraction for fine particles and UFPs mainly depends on tidal volume and respiratory time and does not differ significantly between young and elderly subjects using the same controlled breathing patterns (391, 397, 398) . Consistent with these observations, deposition of UFPs (<100 nm) increases markedly with exercise as a result of both increased minute ventilation and an increase in the depositional fraction (389, 390) . The influence of lung function parameters (functional residual capacity, FEV 1 , and specific airway conductance) on the deposition fraction appears to be essentially negligible in healthy subjects (391, 398) . However, this is not applicable to patients with obstructive airway disease. Results from several recent studies indicate that deposition of fine particles as well as UFPs is greater in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than in healthy subjects (389, Examination of autopsy lungs indicates that particles are retained in lung parenchyma from residents of areas with low-to-moderate air pollution (401) and that particle burden is significantly higher in lungs from residents of more highly polluted areas (402) . A vast majority of these particles have aerodynamic diameters smaller than 2.5 \u00b5m, but UFPs constitute only a small fraction of the total (401) . Such studies further show that retention of fine particles occurs primarily in terminal and respiratory bronchioles and is associated with inflammatory changes and small airway remodeling that may contribute to chronic airflow obstruction (395, 403, 404) .",

However, the results from several large prospective cohort studies, in which such corrections are possible, have not only confirmed that higher ambient particulate pollution levels are associated with significant increases in deaths from lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease but have yielded much larger effect estimates (409, 418) . The results of the Harvard Six Cities Study (409) were independently validated (419) . In a recent extended follow-up of one of the American Cancer Society cohorts, an increase in annual mean PM 2.5 concentration was found to correlate with increases in allcause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality of at least 4, 6, and 8% of subjects, respectively; the estimate depended on the time period during which PM 2.5 levels were measured (410) . All other causes of mortality were not associated with particulate air pollution. In partial contrast, in a cohort of nonsmoking Seventh-Day Adventists, ambient concentrations of PM 10 were significantly associated with all-cause mortality in both genders and with lung cancer deaths in males only but were not associated with cardiopulmonary mortality (420). However, there was a significant association with deaths for which the death certificate made any mention of nonmalignant respiratory disease as an underlying or contributing cause of death.",

Nonetheless, the increase in daily mortality associated with particulate air pollution does not appear to be simply \" premature harvesting\"-that is, the advancement of death by a few days in individuals with severe illness. Instead, some recent analyses have suggested that particulate air pollution shortens life expectancy by at least several months (424, 425) . Additionally, consistent with the results of prospective studies, the effect size estimates become considerably larger when longer lag periods are considered (417, 425) . We emphasize that although the effects of acute PM exposure on mortality are very small, a vast majority of the world population is exposed to this type of pollution, making the number of premature deaths associated with this exposure substantial. A recent estimate stated that 800,000 deaths worldwide are attributable to particulate pollution alone, of which approx 65% occur in Asia (426) . Note that adverse effects associated with particulate air pollution are evident at levels below the standards set by various governmental and supragovernmental agencies. Furthermore, the relationship between PM concentrations and adverse health effects is essentially linear, and there does not appear to be a threshold below which exposure can be considered safe (405, 406) .",

However, there are considerable differences in the size of the effect estimates. This is most likely attributable to differences in absolute exposure levels, particle sources, and their size distribution and composition, but may also include differences in the subjects and in the definitions of outcome measures. Further evidence of plausibility comes from the finding that PMassociated adverse health effects cover a continuous spectrum of severity (406) . In addition to increased mortality, this spectrum includes increased hospitalizations for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (412, 427, 428) , emergency department and other health care visits for asthma and other respiratory symptoms (407, (429) (430) (431) , prevalence of atherosclerosis (432) , decreased lung function and lung function growth (433) (434) (435) (436) (437) (438) (439) , and increased respiratory infections and respiratory symptoms (440, 441) .",

Therefore, most panel studies have focused on children and adults with asthma or, more rarely, COPD. Significant negative associations between daily fluctuations in PM 10 and PEF deviation or prevalence of PEF decrements greater than 10 and 20% have been reported in asthmatic children (406, 445, (449) (450) (451) (452) (453) (454) . An association of borderline significance was also noted in one panel of patients with COPD (455). These are not entirely consistent findings (456) (457) (458) (459) . Notably, no effect of PM 10 on PEFR were observed in the Pollution Effects on Asthmatic Children in Europe (PEACE) study, one of the largest panel studies on air pollution and respiratory health in children with chronic respiratory symptoms, involving more than 2000 children in 14 European centers (460) .

In some investigations, associations between PM and increased symptoms and/or decreased lung function were only noted, or were stronger, in those subjects who were taking anti-inflammatory medication (449, 450) . This was even reported from panels whose prevalence of asthma medication use increased in association with elevated particulate pollution (470, 474) . Note that this increased overall medication use did not necessarily affect the associations of PM with lung function in the same way it influenced the association with symptoms (470, 474) . Others were unable to detect a significant interaction between the effects of anti-inflammatory medication use at baseline and PM 10 exposure on asthma symptoms (466) or lung function (FEV 1 ) (463) . Finally, there have also been studies in which particulate air pollution significantly affected lung function, exhaled NO (476, 477) , or symptoms (457, 475) to a much greater extent, or exclusively in children who did not take inhaled corticosteroids.",

            "text": "Some of these discrepancies may have resulted from the fact that some studies assessed medication use only at baseline, whereas others assessed medication use during the entire follow-up period. Additionally, the effects of Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 particulate pollution on lung function and symptoms were observed at different lag and averaging times in the various studies. The averaging time for particulate concentrations, symptom severity of the subjects, and medication use were all found to have a major impact on the association between PM pollution and increased symptom scores in a study of 25 children and adolescents with asthma in southern California (465) . The largest effect of 24-h mean PM 10 concentrations was noted in less symptomatic children who did not take anti-inflammatory medications, whereas more symptomatic asthmatics showed the greatest increase in symptoms in association with short-term PM 10 excursion (1-h means). No association between PM 10 at any averaging or lag time could be detected in subjects who took anti-inflammatory medications, whereas nonmedicated subjects exhibited large and significant increases in symptom scores in association with sameday 8-h maximum and 24-h mean PM 10 levels as well as with their 5-d moving averages. Overall, the available data suggest that anti-inflammatory medication and possibly bronchodilator use provide some protection from the effects of particulate pollution on lung function and symptoms in patients with asthma. Protection may be incomplete if the type or dose of medication is inadequate. In some patient groups, however, medication use appears to be a marker of asthma severity, which confounds the protective effects of anti-inflammatory therapy.",

Therefore, fewer studies have investigated the effects of fine PM on respiratory health. Re-analysis of data from three large panel studies revealed a significant association between PM 2.5 and increased prevalence of lower respiratory symptoms as well as decreased evening PEF, with the strongest association noted with sulfate fine particles (443) . Conversely, in several panels of children and adults with asthma or asthmatic symptoms, exposure to varying concentrations of PM 2.5 essentially did not correlate with PEF (464, 473, 479) . Ambient fine particulate concentrations were significantly associated with decreased FEV 1 in asthmatic children both in an area where residential wood burning heavily influenced PM concentrations (446) and in an area affected by long-range transport of mostly traffic-related combustion products (463) . Additionally, fine particles derived predominantly from wood burning showed a significant association with decreases in FVC (446) . Conversely, FEV 1 and lowest daily FEV 1 values did not correlate with PM 2.5 in asthmatic children from Detroit, although in combination with O 3 , PM 2.5 had highly significant effects on both variability and lowest daily values of FEV 1 (450) . The risk of lower respiratory symptoms and cough was also found to increase with elevated levels of ambient PM 2.5 (466, 479) , as was medication use (468, 469) . ",

The strongest association was demonstrated with an interquartile increase in mean 12-h daytime 5-d moving average of personal PM exposure, which was associated with a 22% decrease in FEV 1 . In another panel study of subjects with asthma from Toronto, Canada, FVC, FEV 1 , and forced expiratory flow (FEF were not significantly associated with personal particulate exposure, but there was considerable confounding by increased use of asthma medication (480) .",

However, other studies have provided little indication that the effects of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) are stronger than those of PM 10 . Rather, in the few available direct comparisons, PM 10 actually was found to have slightly stronger independent effects on FEV 1 (450, 463) and symptoms in children with asthma (466) and on PEFR in unselected children (442) . As we later discuss, in the context of possible mechanisms, there are some indications that the ultrafine size fraction of PM may affect respiratory outcomes more strongly than fine or inhalable particles, but the available data are inconclusive.",

Two-pollutant models indicate that the effects of PM often are at least partly independent of those of other pollutants (442, 450, 465) , but there are also instances where inclusion of gaseous pollutants in the model abrogates the significance of the PM effects (475, 478) . Conversely, abrogation of the effects of other pollutants by PM has also been described (442, 463) , suggesting that the effects of air pollution most likely result from complex mixtures rather than a single agent.",

Although associations have been detected between sameday PM 10 concentrations and the prevalence of decrements in PEF greater than 20% (454, 470) , other results have indicated that the highest effect estimate was obtained with 5-d mean levels (454) . The largest effect of PM 10 levels on PEF deviation was also noted very consistently with 4-or 5-d averages in ambient PM 10 con-Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 centrations (445, 451, 470, 473) . This contrasts with the results of a study in healthy children, who exhibited the greatest PM 10 -asscoiated decrease in PEF immediately following the 24-h monitoring period, whereas no association was observed with 5-d moving average concentrations (442) . This may suggest that the effects of particulate pollution on lung function in healthy and asthmatic children are mediated by different mechanisms. Some of the effects of PM 10 and PM 2.5 on FEV 1 and FVC appear to be more immediate because significant correlations with same-day ambient concentrations were reported in at least one study (446) , and associations with same-day indoor and personal 12-h daytime exposures were noted in another (463) . Considerations of 2-and 4-d lags did not significantly alter the observed associations in one case (446) ; in the other study, the strongest effects were observed for 5-d moving averages of PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations (463) . Diurnal variability of FEV 1 and lowest daily FEV values were found to be affected most strongly 2 d after exposure to PM 10 , whereas the average daily exposure of 3 to 5 d before the FEV 1 measurement was not significantly associated with these outcomes (450) . Note that unlike the preceding study, exposure was not averaged over all five preceding days. However, both PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations with a 3-to 5-d lag significantly correlated with both FEV 1 measures in children with upper respiratory infections.",

It has been hypothesized that UFPs are primarily responsible for the observed health effects because they make up a vast majority of the overall number of particles and are more likely than larger particles to reach the alveoli (481) . According to this hypothesis, UFPs deposited in the alveoli would trigger an inflammatory response with subsequent release of inflammatory mediators that could not only exacerbate lung disease but could induce systemic inflammation and prothrombotic changes in the blood (481) . This hypothesis is partly based on the finding that UFPs can cause pulmonary inflammation in rats, whereas larger particles with the same composition cannot (482, 483) . Particle compo-Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 sition, rather than mass, has been shown to be associated with pulmonary inflammation (484) , and small particles have larger surface areas and contain higher concentrations of soluble transition metals, organic compounds, sulfates, and nitrates. All of these constituents have been implicated in the induction of oxidative stress and inflammatory changes in vitro and in experimental animals (485) (486) (487) (488) (489) (490) . Consistent with the hypothesis that submicrometer particles are mainly responsible for the adverse health effects of particulate air pollution, PEF was more strongly associated with the 5-d mean number of UFP particles than with the mass concentration of fine particles in a panel of adult asthmatics from Erfurt, Germany (491) . The effects of number concentrations of various size fractions of UFPs and mass concentrations of PM were also compared in adult patients with asthma from Helsinki (464, 473) . In these studies, number concentrations of UFPs, but not particle mass in any size range, were negatively associated with PEF deviations but not with respiratory symptoms or medication use.",

Analysis of induced sputum obtained approx 22 h after exposure did not provide evidence of pulmonary inflammation, because the white blood cell count, differential cell counts, IL-6, and IL-8 did not change significantly after CAPS exposure compared with filtered air exposure. Lung function and respiratory symptoms were also not affected. However, there were some indications of systemic inflammation because plasma-soluble ICAM-1 concentrations were increased following CAPS exposure in both groups. Additionally, plasma IL-6 increased during exposure to filtered air and to CAPS in both healthy subjects and asthmatics, but the increase was greater after exposure to CAPS than after air exposure in asthmatics, whereas the healthy subjects showed smaller increases after exposure to CAPS than after air exposure. There were no significant CAPS-induced changes in serum amyloid, fibrinogen, von Willebrandt factor, and factor VII. A notable difference between the studies was that the targeted ventilation rate was considerably lower in Los Angeles (15-20 L/min/m 2 ) than in Chapel Hill (25 L/ min/m 2 ). The resulting lower exposure from decreased deposition fraction together with the use of induced sputum rather than BALF in the Los Angeles group might partly explain why the results of the two studies differed. Differences in particle composition may also have contributed to the discrepant results.",

Nonetheless, indications of systemic inflammation in response to PM exposure have also been reported from cross-sectional and panel studies. Increased white blood cell and platelet counts were significantly associated with PM 10 concentrations in a subsample of NHANES III participants (502) , although there was no association with PM 2.5 levels in a panel of elderly subjects (503) or in young healthy subjects (504) . An increase in the percentage of neutrophils was reported in highway patrol troopers (505) . Additionally, elevated levels of C-reactive protein were found in association with PM 2.5 (503, 505) , PM 10 (506) , and total suspended particles (507) . Several authors also reported that fibrinogen concentrations rose after exposure to elevated concentrations of PM 10 (502,508) , although this was not noted in young healthy adults (504) . Others detected a significant positive association between fibrinogen and O 3 but not PM 10 (509) . Fibrinogen is not only an acute phase protein but is also a marker of hemostasis because it plays a central role in coagulation. Other hemostatic markers have also been reported to be associated with PM 2.5 exposure in cars of highway patrol troopers (505) and with PM 10 and other ambient air pollutants (509) . Increases in plasma viscosity were found during an air pollution episode in Germany (510), but no association was detected between blood viscosity and PM 2.5 concentrations in a panel of elderly subjects from Utah (503).",

The inability to detect significant effects of PM 2.5 and PM 10 on HRV in some other panel studies (519, 520) likely results from the small sample sizes, low absolute pollution levels in both of the locations, low variability of PM 2.5 measurements for most subjects, and, possibly, differences in the composition of particles from these cities compared with other metropolitan areas.",

This type of PM may exert different effects than ambient particles from other sources. The results of controlled exposure studies are also not entirely consistent with these findings (496, 525) . Note that particle concentrators used to generate CAPS concentrate fine particles but not UFPs.

Huang et al. (534) applied principal component analysis to data from their study, which showed that controlled exposure to CAPS from the Chapel Hill area induced an increase in neutrophils in the bronchial and alveolar fraction and increased blood fibrinogen levels in young healthy adults (494) . The results of this analysis indicated that among Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 the water-soluble fraction of CAPS, a sulfate/ Fe/Se factor was associated with an increase in the percentage of neutrophils in BALF and a Cu/Zn/V factor was associated with increased blood fibrinogen. This suggests that soluble constituents of PM differentially affect target organs and systems, which is consistent with the findings of in vitro and animal studies suggesting that particle-associated metals differ in their ability to affect different cell types within the lung and in the mechanisms by which they operate (e.g., induction of oxidative stress or of inflammatory cytokine production by lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages) (486, 488, 535) . These analyses were restricted to outdoor particles. It has been suggested that ambient stationary site measurements, as used in time series and most panel studies, do not accurately reflect personal exposures because people spend approx 90% of their time indoors and the contribution of outdoor particles to indoor concentrations varies widely between homes. Ambient sampling has been shown to overestimate the exposures resulting from traffic-related and long-range transport sources and to underestimate some significant indoor sources (of residential and indoor work environments) (536) . Additionally, the chemical composition of indoor and outdoor particles can differ markedly (537, 538) . Notably, some indoor and outdoor particles exhibited similar trace element composition, but scanning electron microscopy revealed that spherical particles, usually indicative of combustion or other high temperature industrial processes, were present almost exclusively in outdoor and ambient samples (537) . Furthermore, indoor particles can have greater toxicity than outdoor particles (539) . Then, the issue arises regarding whether indoor or outdoor exposures are more relevant to the observed health outcomes.",

In recent studies, different modeling approaches have been used to determine ambient and nonambient exposures to then correlate them with observed health effects (526) . In one of these studies (526) , personal PM 2.5 exposure was found to be composed mostly of nonambient particle exposure, and neither total personal nor nonambient exposure was associated with any of the investigated health outcomes, with the exception of an unexpected increase in FEV 1 . Ambient exposures (as determined from ambient concentrations and time-activity data) were associated with decreased FEV 1 and systolic blood pressure and increased heart rate and supraventricular ectopic heartbeats. In most cases, ambient exposures provided better effect estimates than ambient concentrations. In another study, increases in exhaled NO were more strongly associated with the ambient-generated component of personal exposure (477) . Conversely, and also differing from the previously discussed results (526), indoor-generated PM 2.5 were associated with FEV 1 and FVC but not midexpiratory flow (477) . Note that this association was somewhat dependent on the model used for estimating the indoor-generated component of PM 2.5 exposure. Interestingly, lag 0 indoor home PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 were significantly associated with decreases in FEV 1 , whereas residential outdoor and central site measurements showed some significant associations with FEV 1 only at longer averaging periods in another panel of children with asthma (463) . This also suggests that indoor and outdoor particles differ in the mechanisms through which they induce adverse effects on respiratory health. Although somewhat preliminary in nature, these results suggest that ambient and nonambient particles are differentially associated with various health outcomes.",

The disease was named Legionnaires' disease, and the organism responsible was eventually called Legionella pneumonia. Legionella species are found naturally in warm and humid environments. In buildings, they grow in air conditioning cooling towers, hot water tanks, other parts of the plumbing systems, and hot tubs. The disease is contracted by the inhalation of aerosolized droplets of water that are contaminated with the bacteria, but it is not spread by person-to-person contact. The incubation period is 2 to 14 d. Every year, 8000 to 10,000 people are hospitalized with Legionnaires' disease. Individuals over age 65 yr, those with chronic lung diseases, those who are immunosuppressed, and patients with chronic illness (such as diabetes or cancer) are more susceptible. The mortality rate ranges from 5 to 30%. A less severe, nonrespiratory form of Legionnaires' disease was named Pontiac fever because it was first described in 144 health department facility workers in Pontiac, Michigan (540) . The illness is caused by a bac-terium with characteristics similar to that of L. pneumonia; it is self-limiting, and the symptoms include headache, fever, malaise, and myalgias.",

More recently, fungal components such as extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), \u03b2-(1 3)-D-glucans, and ergosterol have been measured in house dust (553, 554) and air (555) . The results suggest that they may represent acceptable markers of fungal exposure. Statistically significant, although not very strong, correlations were detected between EPS of Aspergillus/Penicillium (EPS-Asp/ Pen) and \u03b2-glucan levels in house dust and total culturable fungi (553, 554) . The weakness of the association may reflect that both markers represent total fungal biomass rather than only culturable species. In one of the studies, EPS-Asp/Pen levels in floor dust were found to correlate positively with occupant-reported, but not investigator-observed, mold and dampness problems in the living room (554) . For bedrooms, the association was inverted, possibly because of allergen avoidance measures. In 110 homes in Canada, airborne \u03b2-glucan and ergosterol concentrations obtained via longterm active sampling (5-7 d) were highly correlated not only with each other but also with area covered by visible mold growth (as care-Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 fully documented by trained inspectors) (555) .

The only exception to this is exacerbation of asthma in individuals who have IgE directed against mold allergens. The National Allergy Bureau of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology interprets outdoor fungal levels (in counts per cubic meter) as follows: 0 = absent, 1 to 6499 = low, 6500 to 12,999 = medium, 13,000 to 49,999 = high, and 50,000 or greater = very high.

There is also evidence for associations with other typical SBS symptoms, although it is weaker than evidence for respiratory symptoms. However, the agents responsible for the increased risk of health effects associated with exposure to dampness remain unclear. There is some evidence that house dust mites are involved but do not fully account for the observed effects.

In the other schools, airborne Penicillium concentrations were not elevated, but heavy to very heavy growth of either Penicillium and Cladosporium or Stachybotrys species was found in swab samples from water-damaged areas. Remedial actions taken by many of the schools reportedly resulted in indoor air fungal profiles similar to those found outdoors and were associated with a marked decrease in the frequency of symptom reports.

Interestingly, in another building with a high frequency of indoor air quality complaints and visible fungal growth in many rooms, the outdoor fungal profile changed considerably during a 6-h observation period, whereas the indoor fungal profile underwent little alteration (569) . Similarly to the study of school buildings, Penicillium was the dominant species in indoor air at all time-points, whereas it was the dominant species in outdoor air in only two of the six samples.",

Similarly, renovation plus thorough cleaning of buildings containing a public swimming pool resulted in a marked decrease in the number of viable molds, led to a change in the species composition of the molds, and was associated with a decrease in the symptom frequency from 66% before the renovation to 4% after completion of the intervention (571) .

Each one of these characteristics affects the type and extent of biological activity, which is predominantly immunostimulatory. The number of different \u03b2-glucans that have been investigated in experimental studies is very limited. \u03b2-(1 3)-D-glucans have been used as markers of fungal exposure, but it remains unclear to what extent they contribute to the health effects attributed to such exposure. One researcher recently reviewed epidemiological and controlled exposure studies along with data from animal experiments investigating the effects of fungal \u03b2-glucans on respiratory health (588) . The author concluded that the epidemiological data suggested an association between \u03b2-glucan exposure and airway inflammation and respiratory symptoms. However, the available evidence was inconsistent and suffered from insufficient statistical power, lack of control for other potential causal agents, and potentially from considerable exposure misclassification. The results of animal studies suggest that high concentrations of \u03b2-glucans have the potential to induce airway inflammation and to enhance specific IgE sensitization, although neither were consistent findings.",

Certain molds are able to produce toxic metabolites known as mycotoxins. They have been studied most extensively in the context of fungal contaminants of foods such as wheat, grapes, rice, maize, oilseeds, and so forth. The fungi that contaminate these grains and foods are also common household fungi, and it is believed that humans can be exposed to mycotoxins in indoor air. Examples of fungi that can produce mycotoxins include Fusarium, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Penicillium, and Stachybotrys. The most common mycotoxins belong to a class of molecules called trichothecenes (ref. Table 19 for the various categories of mycotoxins and the types of trichothecenes). Trichothecenes are a group of structurally similar sesquiterpene molecules, characterized by a 12, 13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene ring system. Trichothecenes generally are extremely stable and are degraded only by heating at high temperatures for a prolonged period. Metabolites of trichothecenes may be less toxic than the parent compound (591) . Interestingly, however, mycotoxins do not appear to be airborne, and even in contaminated air environments, the quantities that humans are exposed to are extraordinarily small and require an enormous exposure for a clinical effect. Therefore, again, the presence of molds containing mycotoxins on a wall or on a carpet should not be interpreted as indicative of ill health any more than the likely presence of such mold on the soles of shoes should be interpreted in the same manner.",

Some of these studies have suggested that the inflammatory response is mediated mainly by trichothecenes. However, more recent investigations have provided evidence that other fungal components also contribute to the lung pathology induced by exposure to S. chartarum. Repeated intranasal instillation of S. chartarum spores was found to cause an influx of monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes into BALF and to increase mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) and several chemokines (604) . These effects were only observed at the higher dose (1 \u00d7 10 5 spores per instillation) and not at the lower dose (1 \u00d7 10 3 spores per instillation). Neither T-helper 1 or T-helper 2 cytokines nor total or specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a levels were significantly increased by S. chartarum instillation. Notably, a strain of S. chartarum that produced satratoxin and a strain that did not produce satratoxin were used in the experiments. The inflammatory effects of the two strains were almost identical, indicating that satratoxin was not required for the induction of pulmonary inflammation. Similar results were reported from an investigation of the effects of intratracheal administration of 1 \u00d7 10 5 intact, autoclaved, and ethanol-extracted spores of S. chartarum in 7-dold rats (605) . During the 72 h following exposure to all three types of fungal spores, there was a significant reduction in alveolar space with simultaneous elevation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and neutrophils in BALF. Intact spores had the greatest effect, followed by autoclaved and ethanol-extracted spores. Differences in the time-course of the response indicated that the trichothecenes were the main contributors to the early inflammation, which peaked 24 h after exposure, although proteins already participated. Peak release of proteins and/or other fungal compounds occurred later in the inflammatory response and appeared to be mainly responsible for prolonging it.",

Both of the S. chartarum strains, but not C. cladosporioides, caused marked vascular leakage in the lung, although they had very different time-courses. Significant increases in BALF TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were noted after treatment with all three fungi but did not show a linear dose-response in the case of the two S. chartarum strains. Conversely, IL-6 levels in BALF rose with increasing spore dose, with only the highest dose of all three fungi producing statistically significant increases. Only the highest dose of the atranone-producing S. chartarum strain significantly raised IL-1\u03b2 concentrations. However, note that the lowest dose of the other strain induced similar levels, but they were not statistically significantly different from controls. Together, these results clearly suggest that substances other than trichothenes and atranones contributed to lung inflammation and pathology. This confirms the findings of the other studies, which also indicate that mycotoxins play an important role in lung inflammation and pathology but do not support the hypothesis that mycotoxins are solely responsible for these effects. Note that these results cannot be directly translated to humans because they were obtained with very high doses of spores corresponding to between 21 million to more than 1 billion spores for an average 70-kg human.",

Sensitization to the fungus leads to an inflammatory response in the lungs and airways, which includes eosinophil infiltration and increased mucus production. Eventually, bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis can occur. Symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, cough productive of brownish mucus, fever, and malaise. Changes observed in chest radiographs are consistent with pneumonia. Laboratory studies have revealed high levels of Aspergillus-specific IgE and elevated peripheral blood eosinophils.

            "text": "Allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) is a disease that is pathologically similar to ABPA, but the sites of inflammation are the paranasal sinuses. Other features include nasal polyposis, nasal and sinus accumulation of fungal debris and allergic mucin, and crust formation (607) . Cultures from the sinuses yield Aspergillus, although this is not pathognomonic, nor is the lack of positive Aspergillus cultures enough to rule out AFS. It is estimated that approx 5% of all patients with chronic rhinosinusitis have AFS. It is more common in atopic patients who have a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and who test positive to one or more fungal allergens. AFS primarily affects young adults, and most cases are geographically distributed in temperate areas with high humidity. Aside from Aspergillus, AFS can be caused by dematiaceous fungi, including Bipolaris, Curvularia, Exserohilum, Drechslera, Alternaria, Helminthosporium, and Fusarium. There is controversy regarding whether AFS is an infectious or allergic disease. The fact that most patients with AFS have positive skin test and radioallergosorbent test to fungal allergens, as well as the prominent incidence of atopy in patients with AFS, support an allergic component to this disease. Eosinophils also play a significant role in AFS, and ECP levels were significantly higher in the mucin of patients with AFS compared with control patients (608) . Criteria for diagnosis of AFS include radiographical evidence of sinusitis, positive fungal stain or culture from the sinus at time of surgery, presence of allergic mucin, absence of fungal invasion, and absence of contributory factors such as immunodeficiencies or diabetes mellitus (609) . Differential diagnoses of AFS include saprophytic fungal growth, fungus balls of the sinuses, eosinophilic mucin sinusitis, and invasive fungal sinusitis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is another respiratory disease that is probably caused by microbes, but it is primarily an allergic disease. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis frequently occurs as occupational asthma, and several etiological agents have been cited. Examples of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and their suspected source include Farmer's lung (moldy hay), bird fancier's lung (parakeet droppings), pigeon breeder's disease (pigeon droppings), hen worker's lung (chicken droppings), bagassosis (sugar cane), mushroom worker's lung (mushroom compost), air conditioner lung (contaminated humidifiers or air conditioners), cork worker's lung (mold cork), malt worker's lung (moldy malt or barley), sequoiosis (moldy bark from redwoods), and woodworker's lung (wood dust). Symptoms include fever, chills, cough, and respiratory distress occurring 4 to 8 h after re-exposure to the inciting agent. If prolonged exposure is present, then the disease progresses into a chronic form and fibrosis develops, eventually leading to respiratory failure. Diagnosis is primarily based on clini-Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 cal features, but it is supported by identification of the source agent, presence of specific antibodies in blood, chest radiography, pulmonary function tests, and lung biopsy. Treatment is based on avoidance and the use of corticosteroids. Therefore, it is important that individual patients be examined, including vigorous review of medical histories, physical examinations, and appropriate diagnostic testing to confirm and establish diagnosis and begin appropriate therapy.",

Results from an exploratory analysis suggest a greater than additive interaction between MBzP and MBP and PCB-153 and CYP450-inducing PCBs (619). It was proposed that this interaction could result from the inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase by hydroxylated PCBs, which results in greater amounts of free phthalate monoesters, believed to be the main biologically active metabolites. Unfortunately, neither OH-PCBs nor the ratio of free vs glucuronidated phthalate monoesters was determined.",

A notable exception is the pioneering work by Kortenkamp and colleagues. For example, they showed that a mixture of the OCs, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, and \u03b2-hexachlorocyclohexane exhibited combination effects on MCF-7 human breast cancer cell proliferation (E-SCREEN) when each of the components was used at concentrations at or below their respective no-observed effect concentrations (620) . Similar results were obtained with combinations of up to 12 estrogenic chemicals in the yeast estrogen screen assays (612, 621, 622) . Generally, the concentration addition model provided excellent predictions of the observed effects, whereas the independent action model, for the most part, did not. However, there were indications that cytotoxic or growth inhibitory effects of compounds included in mixtures might compromise the ability of the model to predict combination effects (622) . The model of Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology Volume 31, 2006 concentration addition was also found to accurately predict the effects of certain binary mixtures of environmental estrogens in vivo, using juvenile rainbow trout as the animal model and vitellogin induction as the measured end point (623) . These findings \"put into sharp relief the limitations of the traditional focus on single agent effects during hazard and risk assessments\" (612) , not only of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals this comment referenced but of many other environmental toxicants.",

Cephalosporium Rhizopus Found on spoiling food, decaying fruits, and vegetables. Mucor Found on organic matter, dung, and soils. Colorless spores. Stemphyllium 23-75 Saprophytic, grows on cellusic material, including livestock feed, ceiling tiles, paper, and cotton cloth. It is a diurnal sporulator. Ulocladium Soil, dung, decaying plant matter, fibers, wood, grasses, textiles, and paper; may be confused with Alternaria. Botrytis Teardrop shape spores, saprophytic and parasitic; part of the Dreschlera group. countries have attempted to set standards for hazardous indoor mold levels. A consensus has proved elusive, and these standards are not supported by clinical data or other scientific evidence. The New York City Department of Health recommends evacuation if the indoor/ outdoor ratio is greater than 1 and if indoor concentrations exceed 1000 spores/m 3 . Brazil sets the threshold for hazardous exposure at 750 spores/m 3 , whereas the standard in the Netherlands is 10 4 spores/m 3 (http://www. inspect-ny.com/sickhouse/moldlevels.htm).Ironically, these recommendations were not developed by vigorous scientific panels: they were arbitrary. In fact, mold counts higher than this value are normally found outdoors!",

Short-term exposure to high doses of P. chrosygenum and Trichoderma harzianum spores did not result in more mucous membrane or general symptoms than placebo. However, exposure to a high concentration of fungal spores for a short period may not accurately capture the effects of long-term exposure to low or moderate doses. One should emphasize that clinical data have only demonstrated a value of IgE antibodies against allergens as a predictor of whether health effects are observed.Although several studies have claimed that fungi are involved in sinus disease, such data do not clearly indicate environmental molds and suggest that recovered mold in cultures is primarily secondary to overgrowth from the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Often, such claims of sinus disease and mold are not even accompanied by appropriate sinus imaging.",
