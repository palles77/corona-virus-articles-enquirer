To identify host proteins that bind to viral RNAs, we took a global approach based on the yeast proteome microarray, which contains 4080 purified yeast proteins. The biotin-labeled RNA probes included two distantly related RNA viruses, namely Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and Brome mosaic virus (BMV). Altogether, we have identified 57 yeast proteins that bound to TBSV RNA and/or BMV RNA. Among the identified host proteins, eleven bound to TBSV RNA and seven bound to BMV RNA with high selectivity, whereas the remaining 39 host proteins bound to both viral RNAs. The interaction between the TBSV replicon RNA and five of the identified host proteins were confirmed via gel-mobility shift and co-purification experiments from yeast. Over-expression of the host proteins in yeast, a model host for TBSV, revealed that 4 host proteins that enhanced TBSV replication as well as 14 proteins that inhibited replication. Detailed analysis of one of the identified yeast proteins binding to TBSV RNA, namely translation elongation factor eEF1A, revealed that it is present in the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex. We also demonstrate binding of eEF1A to the p33 replication protein and a known cis-acting element at the 3\u2032 end of TBSV RNA. Using a functional mutant of eEF1A, we provide evidence on the involvement of eEF1A in TBSV replication.",

In addition, recent genome-wide screens of yeast genes conducted with two distantly related viruses, Brome mosaic virus (BMV) and Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) Panavas et al., 2005b) revealed that their replication is affected by ~100 different host genes. The genome-wide screens with TBSV also identified 30 host genes affecting TBSV RNA recombination Serviene et al., 2006; Serviene et al., 2005) . The identified host genes code for proteins involved in various cellular processes, such as translation, RNA metabolism, protein modifications and intracellular transport or membrane modifications Kushner et al., 2003; Panavas et al., 2005b) . Additional genome-wide screens with Drosophila virus C and West Nile virus have also identified over 100 host genes (Cherry et al., 2005; Krishnan et al., 2008) . However, these genome-wide screens likely missed the identification of host genes with overlapping functions. Therefore, additional screens are needed, which are less affected by gene redundancy, to identify the total number of host genes affecting virus replication.",

Also, the yeast protein array identified 58 yeast proteins interacting with the TBSV p33 and an additional 11 yeast proteins interacting with the readthrough portion of p92 pol replication protein (Li et al., 2008) . In addition, a yeast protein array approach was used to identify many host proteins interacting with a 3\u2032 fragment of the BMV RNA (Zhu et al., 2007) . Two of those host proteins were found to affect BMV infection in plants.",

Host proteins binding to BMV RNA included tRNA binding proteins, and proteins that are part of large mRNP complexes. More detailed work with a TBSV RNA binding protein, namely eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), has revealed that eEF1A is a component of the purified replicase and binds to the 3\u2032 end of the TBSV RNA as well as to TBSV p33 replication co-factor. An eEF1A mutant has provided evidence that eEF1A is important for TBSV replication by stabilizing the p33 replication protein.",

Because TBSV and BMV are only distantly related, they provided good substrates to identify virus-specific and nonspecific RNA-binding proteins. For example, the TBSV RNA is uncapped and nonpolyadenylated (White and Nagy, 2004) , whereas the BMV RNA is capped and carries a tRNA-like structure at the 3\u2032 end . In the experiments involving TBSV, we used either the full-length genomic (g)RNA or a defective interfering (DI) RNA, whereas we chose RNA1 of the three-component BMV for comparison. A nonspecific unlabeled competitor, in the form of poly(dC) -poly(dG), was used in the RNA binding solution to reduce signals derived from nonspecific binding to the chip and to general DNA-binding proteins (Hall et al., 2004) . The biotinylated viral RNA probes bound to the purified host proteins on the protein array ( Fig. 1) were detected by using Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor647 and a microchip scanner (see Materials and Methods).",

After 20 h expression of the particular host protein, we launched TBSV repRNA replication from CUP1 promoter as described in the Materials and Methods. Yeast cells were harvested 24 h later, at which point the amount of viral repRNA was assessed by Northern blotting and compared with yeast ribosomal RNA for normalization of TBSV repRNA accumulation. These experiments revealed that over-expression of four host proteins, Dbp2p, Gcd2p, Mdm38p and Stm1p, increased repRNA accumulation by, 35, 59, 55 and 43%, respectively, when compared to yeast carrying the empty expression vector (Fig. 4A ). In contrast, over-expression of 14 viral RNAbinding proteins highlighted in gray reduced TBSV repRNA accumulation by 2.5-to-10-fold in yeast ( Fig. 4A-B) . Over-expression of the remaining 28 host proteins inhibited TBSV repRNA accumulation by two-fold or less (Fig. 4A ). This level of inhibition of TBSV repRNA accumulation might not be significant, because over-expression of a pseudogene (APT2), which has no enzymatic activity when expressed (Alfonzo et al., 1999) , also led to reduced TBSV repRNA accumulation (63.7 \u00b1 15.9%), suggesting that two-fold or less reduction might be due to the reduced ability of yeast cells to support repRNA accumulation under the protein over-expression condition. Together, the above experiments indicated that over-expression of 40% of the 45 RNA-binding host proteins could affect TBSV repRNA accumulation in yeast.",

            "text": "To further test the functional relevance of the identified yeast proteins interacting with the TBSV repRNA, we selected eEF1A, which functions as a translation elongation factor and has been shown to be part of replicase complexes of several RNA viruses (Blackwell and Brinton, 1997; Blumenthal, Young, and Brown, 1976; Brinton, 2001; Nishikiori et al., 2006) and its ability to bind to the tombusvirus p92 RdRp protein (Li et al., 2008) . In addition, we performed preliminary pull-down experiments with biotin-labeled DI-72 (+)repRNA that was immobilized onto the streptavidin coated magnetic beads, followed by binding assay using a yeast cytosolic extract , which have led to the identification of eEF1A by mass-spectrometry (not shown). This finding suggested that eEF1A is likely one of the major TBSV RNA binding proteins in the yeast cytosol. To test if eEF1A is a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex, we used a eEF1A-specific antibody in Western blotting of a highly purified replicase preparation that was obtained via two-step Nickel/FLAG-affinity purification of the solubilized tombusviral p33HF and p92HF proteins tagged with 6xHis-and FLAG affinity tags from enriched membranes derived from yeast (Li et al., 2008) . eEF1A was easily detectable in the purified replicase complex, regardless of whether or not crosslinking was applied (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4) . Similar preparations obtained via two-step affinity purification from yeast expressing only single 6xHis-tagged p33H and p92H proteins contained only small amount of eEF1A, suggesting that the presence of eEF1A in the highly purified tombusvirus replicase preparation is not due to contamination of the affinity-resin with the abundant eEF1A (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 3) . Since eEF1A binds to the TBSV repRNA, it is possible that these proteins are part of the solubilized/purified replicase complex via binding to the TBSV repRNA. This possibility was tested by treating the solubilized/purified replicase complex with an RNase during the first affinity purification step to destroy the RNA components, followed by FLAG-affinity purification. Interestingly, the amount of co-purified eEF1A was unchanged in the highly purified replicase (Fig. 5, lane 6) , suggesting that eEF1A not only binds to the repRNA, but to a protein component of the viral replicase as well.",

Briefly, the split-ubiquitin assay is based on the ability of N-terminal (NubG) and C-terminal (Cub) halves of ubiquitin to reconstitute a functional protein (Fetchko, Auerbach, and Stagljar, 2003; Fetchko and Stagljar, 2004) . When NubG and Cub, which are fused separately to interacting proteins, are brought to close proximity and reconstitute a functional ubiquitin protein, then cleavage by endogenous ubiquitin specific proteases leads to the release of the transcription factor, resulting in growth on selective media. The split ubiquitin assay revealed that eEF1A interacted with the membrane-bound p33 when used as N-terminal fusion with NubG ( Fig. 6) indicating that eEF1A interacts with both the TBSV repRNA and the membrane-bound p33 in yeast.",

To test if the 3\u2032 UTR of the TBSV RNA is also bound to eEF1A, we made a 32 P-labeled RNA probe containing the conserved three 3\u2032 terminal stem-loops in the TBSV RNA, termed SL1, SL2 and SL3 (Na and White, 2006) . Gel mobility shift assay with purified recombinant eEF1A revealed binding to the WT SL1/2/3 sequence (Fig. 7A, lanes 2-4) . A G-to-C modification at the 3\u2032 terminus in construct SL1/2/3 that weakens SL1 (termed mutant gPR-C) and the middle-range interaction between gPR and SL3, which is critical for the assembly of the replicase (Panaviene, Panavas, and Nagy, 2005) , did not change the binding to eEF1A in vitro (Fig. 7A, lanes 6-8) . On the contrary, deletion of 5 nts within a known cis-acting element, termed replication silencer element (RSE) (Pogany et al., 2003) , inhibited binding to eEF1A (Fig. 7A , lanes 9-12). This deletion is within an 8 nt long internal loop and is not expected to change the structure of SL3 dramatically, albeit it destroys the middle-range interaction between SL3 and gPR, which includes SL1 (see the WT construct in Fig. 7A ) (Pogany et al., 2003) . Template competition experiments with unlabeled competitors confirmed the above results, since construct SL1/2/3\u0394GGGCU(+) lacking 5nt of the RSE element was a poor competitor when compared with the wt and other RNAs carrying mutations within the gPR sequence (Fig. 7B ). Altogether, these data indicate that eEF1A binds to RSE, an important cis-acting element involved in the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase (Panaviene, Panavas, and Nagy, 2005) .",

Western blot analysis of replication protein levels in the TKY848 (T22S) strain revealed that the p92 pol was expressed at a level comparable to the WT eEF1A strain (Fig. 8E ), while p33 level was reduced to 33% (Fig. 8F ).

The in vitro translation assay prepared from yeast strains expressing either WT eEF1A or eEF1A(T22S) supported the production of comparable levels of p33 and the control MS2-CFP ( Fig. 8H ) from the added mRNAs, suggesting that the T22S mutation in eEF1A did not affect the translation of p33.",

We found that many of the identified host RNA binding proteins affected TBSV repRNA replication, confirming their relevance. For example, Dbp2p, Gcd2p, Stm1p and Mdm38 enhanced TBSV repRNA accumulation, while 14 proteins out of 45 yeast proteins tested decreased TBSV repRNA accumulation by 2.5-10-fold in a protein overexpression assay ( Fig. 4A-B ).

We propose that Gcd2p and Dbp2p could facilitate the recruitment of the viral RNA into replication (via inhibiting translation of the genomic RNA) or promoting the assembly of the viral replicase complex prior to replication. Also, Dbp2p might enhance replication via interacting and inhibiting Nog1p, a putative GTPase, whose down-regulation led to increased TBSV repRNA accumulation in yeast . It is less straightforward to propose a model for the activity of Mdm38p, which is a mitochondrial membrane protein with no known RNA-binding activity (Table 2 ).

            "text": "Eukaryotic viral RNA replicases contain viral-and host-coded components. Previous proteomic approaches with highly purified tombusvirus replicase or using the yeast protein array have led to the identification of four host proteins that are integral components of the tombusvirus replicase complex: the heat shock protein 70 chaperones (Ssa1/2p in yeast), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, encoded by TDH2 and TDH3 in yeast), pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p) and Cdc34p ubiquitin ligase (Li et al., 2008; Serva and Nagy, 2006; Wang and Nagy, 2008) . The current work establishes that eEF1A is also an integral part of the replicase complex. Replicase purification experiments with or without protein crosslinking confirmed the presence of eEF1A (Fig. 5 ). In addition, we have shown that eEF1A can bind to the TBSV repRNA in vitro as well as the TBSV repRNA can be co-purified with eEF1A from yeast (Fig. 3) . Moreover, eEF1A has been shown to interact with the p33 replication cofactor based on the yeast split-ubiquitin two-hybrid assay (Fig. 6) . Interestingly, eEF1A has also been shown to bind to the non-overlapping portion of the p92 pol RdRp protein in vitro based on yeast protein array experiments (Li et al., 2008) . Thus, the accumulating evidence shows that eEF1A interacts with components of the tombusvirus replicase, including repRNA, p33 and p92 pol replication proteins. It is also interesting that eEF1A has been shown to interact with the yeast Tdh2p (GAPDH) (Gavin et al., 2006) , which is also a component of the tombusvirus replicase. Overall, the multiple interactions of eEF1A with various components of the tombusvirus replicase could be important for eEF1A to regulate the functions of the viral replicase complex. eEF1A is a highly abundant protein with the canonical role of delivering aminoacyl-tRNA to the elongating ribosome in a GTP dependent manner. Many additional functions have been ascribed to eEF1A including quality control of newly produced proteins, ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, and organization of the actin cytoskeleton (Chuang et al., 2005; Gross and Kinzy, 2005) . The first evidence that a translation elongation factor plays a role in (+)RNA virus replication was obtained with bacteriophage Qbeta (Blumenthal, Young, and Brown, 1976 ). Subsequently, eEF1A was found to bind to many viral RNAs (Dreher, 1999) . The list includes the 3\u2032UTR of (+)RNA of West Nile virus (WNV) based on nitrocellulose filter binding assays and RNase footprinting (Blackwell and Brinton, 1997; Brinton, 2001) . This is supported by functional data, since mutations in the eEF1A binding site of WNV RNA decreased minusstrand synthesis and eEF1A is co-localized with the WNV replicase in the infected cells (Davis et al., 2007) . Similarly, eEF1A was shown to bind to the 3\u2032 end of Turnip yellow mosaic virus (+)RNA leading to enhanced translation but repressed minus-strand synthesis (Dreher, 1999; Dreher, Uhlenbeck, and Browning, 1999; Matsuda, Yoshinari, and Dreher, 2004) . In addition, eEF1A was reported to bind to Dengue virus, Tobacco mosaic virus and Turnip mosaic virus (+)RNA (De Nova-Ocampo, Villegas-Sepulveda, and del Angel, 2002; Nishikiori et al., 2006; Thivierge et al., 2008; Zeenko et al., 2002) . eEF1A has also been shown to interact with various viral replication proteins or the replicase as shown for the NS5A replication protein of BVDV (Johnson et al., 2001) , NS4A of HCV (Kou et al., 2006) , the TMV replicase (Yamaji et al., 2006) , and Gag polyprotein of HIV-1 (Cimarelli and Luban, 1999) . It is also part of the replicase complex of vesicular stomatitis virus, a negative-stranded RNA virus (Qanungo et al., 2004) . Overall, eEF1A likely plays a role in the replication of several RNA viruses via its interactions with viral RNAs and viral replication proteins. The high abundance of eEF1A in cells might facilitate its recruitment into virus replication.",

            "text": "Since eEF1A is an essential G protein affecting translation elongation, it is very difficult to obtain evidence for its direct involvement in virus replication in living cell. Accordingly, downregulation of eEF1A has led to not only decreased TBSV repRNA accumulation, but also reduced p33 levels ( Fig. 8A-C) . However, using functional eEF1A mutants defective in various functions and domains could potentially lead to identification of functions provided by eEF1A during TBSV repRNA replication in yeast. In this work, we have used four different groups of eEF1A mutants ( Table 2 ). The most interesting mutant was eEF1A(T22S), which has mutation within the P-loop leading to decreased binding of eEF1A to GDP (Ozturk et al., 2006) . This mutation renders eEF1A functionally independent of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eEF1B\u03b1. We found that eEF1A(T22S) supported TBSV repRNA replication only at ~26% level when compared with the WT eEF1A (Fig. 8D) . Interestingly, yeast expressing eEF1A (T22S) displayed normal levels of p92 pol , but reduced levels of p33 replication protein (Fig. 8E-F) . Since eEF1A (T22S) is known to reduce total translation level by 35% and decrease translational fidelity (Ozturk et al., 2006) , we tested if eEF1A (T22S) affected p33 translation using an in vitro assay (Fig. 8H ). However, the translation level of p33 was comparable in extracts prepared from yeast expressing either WT eEF1A or eEF1A(T22S). Thus, it is unlikely that eEF1A (T22S) would affect p33 level through its effect on general translation. More importantly, the half-life of p33 was reduced by more than 2-fold in yeast expressing eEF1A(T22S), suggesting that eEF1A is involved in stabilization of p33 in yeast.",

The only exception is BUD21(UTP16), whose deletion increased replication of TBSV repRNA (Panavas et al., 2005b) . It is possible that many genes involved in TBSV repRNA replication and recombination are functionally redundant. Indeed, the host proteins that were identified in a highly purified functional tombusvirus replicase complex (such as Ssa1/2p and Tdh2/3p), are coded by two or more genes in the yeast genome (Serva and Nagy, 2006) and eEF1A (this work) are coded by two or more genes in the yeast genome. This functional redundancy in host genes justifies the need for multiple genome-or proteome-wide approaches in the identification of host genes affecting TBSV replication and recombination.",

However, this approach failed to identify Ded1p and Lsm1p, two known RNA-binding proteins that affected BMV replication in yeast (Diez et al., 2000; Noueiry and Ahlquist, 2003) . Ded1p selectively inhibits the translation of 2a protein from RNA2, whereas we used RNA1 in our experiments, which might bind inefficiently to Ded1p. It is also possible that some proteins are not functional in RNA-binding when fixed on the chip. Alternatively, the interaction between the host protein and the viral RNA could be facilitated by additional factors, such as the 1a replication protein of BMV, which were not present in our in vitro analysis. The Lsm1plike proteins are known to form multimeric, doughnut-shaped complexes , and this screen would likely miss any protein that acts in a heteromeric complex. In addition, the protein array contains only ~70% of the known/predicted number of proteins expressed in yeast. The above examples highlight the possibility that our current work is likely an under estimation of the number of host proteins that bind to viral RNAs. Regardless of these limitations, the protein array approach could provide a rapid tool for identification or confirmation of RNA binding host proteins.",

The TAP tag consists of Protein A sequence, a TEV protease cleavage site and the calmodulin binding protein domain and affinity purification was performed as described (Puig et al., 2001) . Selected yeast strains from the TAP-library were transformed with pYC-DI-72 to express TBSV DI-72(+) RNA from GAL1 promoter (Panavas and Nagy, 2003) .

Lysates were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold IPP-150 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40), followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 30,000g at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was loaded on a 0.2 ml IgG agarose containing column (Sigma) followed by incubation and washing with 30 ml of ice-cold IPP-150 buffer. Then, the column was equilibrated with 1 ml of TEV protease cleavage buffer, followed by addition of 10 \u03bcl of TEV protease (AcTEV protease from Invitrogen) and incubation for 1 h at room temperature.

Western-blotting with anti-6xHis antibody detected the presence of p33 and p92 pol in the purified replicase complex that is active in an in vitro replication assay (not shown) as demonstrated earlier (Serva and Nagy, 2006) . The asterisks indicate p33 homodimers that are partly resistant to denaturing conditions. Yeast cells were subjected to formaldehyde cross-linking (lanes 3-6) prior to lysis, purification and digestion with RNase A (lanes 5-6) (B) Western blotting of the same samples as in panel A with anti-eEF1A antibody. Note that the native eEF1A was expressed from its original promoter and original location on the chromosome. (C) The original amount of eEF1A in solubilized membrane preparations from yeast was detected with anti-eEF1A antibody in total protein samples. Interaction between eEF1A and p33 in the split-ubiquitin two-hybrid assay. The full-length TEF2 sequence was fused to NubG as N-terminal fusion, and the p33 sequence was fused to Cub. The heat shock protein 70 (SSA1) was used as a positive control because it is known to interact with p33 (Serva and Nagy, 2006) . Binding of eEF1A to the replication silencer sequence of the TBSV (+)repRNA in vitro. (A) Gel mobility shift assay was performed with the 32 P-labeled WT-SL1/SL2/SL3(+) RNA probe. The SL1/SL2/SL3 sequence represents the 86 nt 3\u2032 terminal, highly structured sequence of the TBSV (+)RNA with two known cis-acting elements: the replication silencer element required for the assembly of the viral replicase and gPR that is an essential promoter for initiation of minus-strand synthesis and it is also required for replicase assembly. The mutated/deleted bases are indicated with black boxes. The recombinant eEF1A purified from yeast as GST-fusion protein was tested in three different dilutions: 2.0, 0.8 and 0.4 \u03bcg.

(A) The expression of eEF1A protein was down-regulated from a copper-repressible promoter in TKY616. Replication of the TBSV repRNA was measured by Northern blotting 12 h after initiation of TBSV replication and suppression of eEF1A expression. (B) Accumulation of p33 and (C) eEF1A was estimated by Western blotting using anti-His and anti-eEF1A antibodies, respectively. (D) Reduced accumulation of TBSV repRNA in TKY848 yeast expressing eEF1A(T22S) as the only form of eEF1A 24 h after induction of TBSV repRNA replication. The TBSV repRNA and 18S ribosomal RNA levels were estimated by Northern blotting. RecRNA shows novel recombinant RNAs derived from TBSV repRNA and characterized earlier .

(G) The production of p33 mRNA from an expression plasmid was estimated by Northern blotting using p33 mRNA-specific probe. (H) Translation of p33 in extracts prepared from TKY848 and TKY102 yeast strains. The in vitro translation assay of p33 from an exogenously added mRNA in the presence of 35 S methionine was performed with extracts containing comparable amounts of yeast proteins. Samples were taken at various time points as shown. Bottom panel: Translation of MS2-CFP from an exogenously added mRNA was used as a control.
