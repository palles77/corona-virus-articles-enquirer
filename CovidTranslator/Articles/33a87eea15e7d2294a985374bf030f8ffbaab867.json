In addition, more than 3.7 billion humans suffer from malnutrition (WHO 2004a) , and 2.2 million infants and children die each year from diarrhea, which is caused largely by contaminated water and food (Population Resource 2004) .",

For example, the 1985 construction of a dam 100 km from the mouth of the Senegal River in West Africa was followed by an explosion in Schistosoma mansoni in the human population. By 1994, 72% of the population was infected whereas there had been no documented cases prior to the dam's construction . Additionally, various models suggest that climate change could lead to the spread of schistosomiasis to more areas in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America (Martens 1995) . Schistosomiasis is relatively stable in Africa (it has been there longer) but continues to colonize new snail hosts in South America, increasing its distribution .",

Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT), when first used for treating homes, resulted in dramatic reductions in the incidence of malaria in people. For example, in South Africa the use of DDT has been highly successful from 1945 to 1995 and there has been no sign of DDT resistance in vectors over the 50-year period (Guaasekasan et al. 2005) . However, when DDT was also used for agricultural purposes, it exposed most of the mosquito populations to DDT and the mosquitoes evolved high levels of resistance to DDT, making DDT relatively ineffective (ICAITI 1977) . Most nations have abandoned the use of DDT for use in agriculture. Yet, DDT appears to be one of the most effective insecticides for controlling malaria when sprayed on the inside walls of houses and Chris Curtis of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reports no serious environmental problems when treating the inside of houses (Curtis 2002) . Mosquitoes do not develop resistance because the quantities used are small; spraying is required only once or twice a year, and only a few mosquitoes (those inside houses) are actually exposed to DDT (Walker et al. 2003; Shapiro 2004) . Additionally, the negative effects usually associated with DDT, such as bird kills, are greatly reduced by using only small quantities of DDT inside houses (Pimentel 2005) . However, it must be emphasized that DDT is a hazardous chemical (John Rappole, personal communication, Smithsonian Nation Zoological Park, Front Royal, VA.). Since most mosquito bites occur after dark when people are inside their homes the use of DDT could dramatically reduce the incidence of malaria in endemic areas (Walker et al. 2003; Shapiro 2004) .",

Deforestation in parts of Africa has exposed land to sunlight and promotes the development of temporary pools of water with more neutral pH than puddles in forested areas where organic matter is abundant and pH is acidic (pH 4.5-5.5). The new pools facilitate the breeding of human-biting, malaria-transmitting mosquitoes (Coluzzi 1994; Patz et al. 2000) . Moreover, changing land use activity allows new mosquito species to move in and proliferate. For example, between 1971 and 1986 Brazil experienced a 76% increase in malaria transmitted by mosquitoes (Patz et al. 2000) . As a result of mining operations, migrants help malaria pathogens to migrate between deforested areas (Patz et al. 2000) . In addition, global warming is improving environmental conditions for mosquito proliferation, malaria, and other diseases (Epstein et al. 1998; Patz 2002) . In sub-Saharan Africa the average person in an endemic area receives 121 bites from malaria-infected mosquitoes each year ). In addition, mosquito vectors are evolving resistance to insecticides, while the protozoan pathogens are evolving resistance to anti-malarial drugs, reducing the effectiveness of the control efforts (Lambert 2004; Whitty et al. 2004) .",

These chemicals find their way into our bodies through the air we breathe, the water we drink, our food, and our every day environmental exposure. In fact, 48 states have advisories limiting fish consumption because of contamination, like mercury, found in fish (Anderson et al. 2004) . In Oklahoma, ponds tested from 2000 to 2003 by the Environmental Protection Agency have been found to have mercury levels above the 0.5 ppm that can be dangerous for pregnant women and children (Tyree 2006) . Despite advisories, currently 6% of women of childbearing age in the USA have potentially hazardous levels of mercury in their blood, which can cause developmental and neurologicial defects in fetuses (Jones et al. 2004) . Coal-fired power plants are the largest source of mercury pollution.",

For example, 19 pathogen species that infect humans have been recorded in blowing soil in various regions of the earth, including anthrax, TB, flu virus, and hantavirus (Griffin et al. 2001) . Erosion disperses toxic chemicals, such as heavy metals and pesticides, leading to contaminated food and water resources. Soil depth is also critical to food crop production.

In developing nations, more than one third of the infectious disease burden is due to malnutrition (Mason et al. 2004) . For children, malnutrition increases their susceptibility to infectious diseases and death by 42 to 57% (Pelletier et al. 1994) . Malnourished individuals, especially children, are seriously affected by parasitic infections because these infections also reduce nutrient availability. The presence of intestinal parasites frequently diminishes appetite and food intake, and also increases the loss of nutrients by causing diarrhea and dysentery. Hookworms, for instance, can suck as much as 30 ml of blood from an infected person each day, gradually weakening individuals and lowering their resistance to other diseases (Hotez and Pritchard 1995) . Latham et al. (1990) measured the caloric gain that Kenyan schoolboys obtained once given treatment to eliminate their multiple helminth infections. Based on these data, it is possible to estimate the daily amount of food intake that is necessary to offset the helminth infections. The daily recommendation for children 9 to 13 years is about 2,000 kcal (Institute of Medicine 2002).",

Many microbe types have evolved resistance to antibiotics (Antibiotic Resistance 2004; Levy and Marshall 2004) . The bacteria resistant to antibiotics cost the USA more than $4 billion in added treatments and lost productivity each year (Table I ). The evolution of drug resistance in microbes can be surprisingly rapid. In 1979, only 6% of the European Pneumococcus strains were resistant to penicillin, but one decade later that percentage had grown to 44% (Platt 1996) . Currently in the USA, more than 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus, one of the most common disease-producing microbes, are resistant to penicillin and similarly effective antibiotics (American Society of Microbiology 1994). A study of 113 French pig farmers reported that nasopharyngeal carriage of S. aureus resistant to macrolide was more frequent in farmers than non-farmers. The large-scale antibiotic use associated with today's industrial livestock farming, in addition to antibiotic drug resistance in bacteria gaining entrance to the human food chain, pose serious public health problems (CDC 2005) . Rapid increase in drug resistance by disease organisms is caused by the widespread use and overuse of 300 antibiotics by the medical profession (ASM 1994) . In addition, eight times more antibiotics are used in livestock production than are used to treat humans (UCS 2001) . The concurrent overuse of antibiotics for both humans and livestock enhances selection for drug-resistant microbes, further exacerbating the problem of antibiotic resistance.",
