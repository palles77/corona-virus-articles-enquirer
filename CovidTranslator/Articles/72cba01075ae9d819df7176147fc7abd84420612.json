The potential of Myt1 to play a role in OP responses leading to remyelination was examined using murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV) to induce spinal cord demyelination and potential relevance to human pathology was evaluated in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. In MHV-infected mice, the density of Myt1 expressing cells markedly increased in lesioned areas of spinal cord white matter. Myt1 expressing cells proliferated most extensively during active demyelination and subsequently accumulated to maximal levels during early remyelination. Cells with nuclear Myt1 immunoreactivity were mainly OP cells, identified by co-localization with platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor, with additional phenotypes being either oligodendrocytes or neural stem cells, identified by CC1 antigen and Musashi1, respectively. The density of OP cells expressing Myt1 was significantly increased in white matter of MHV-infected mice during demyelination and early remyelination then as remyelination advanced the values returned to levels comparable to PBSinjected control mice. In MHV lesions, Myt1 was not expressed in astrocytes, lymphocytes, or macrophage/micro-glial cells. MS lesions demonstrated increased Myt1 expression in both the periplaque white matter adjacent to lesions and within early remyelinating lesions. These results suggest a potential role for Myt1 in the regeneration of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in response to demyelination.",

Myt1 is a zinc-finger DNA binding protein that was originally identified based upon binding affinity within the promoter region of the proteolipid (PLP) gene, the most abundantly transcribed CNS myelin gene (Kim and Hudson, 1992) . During development of the oligodendrocyte lineage, Myt1 is localized within nuclei of immature cells and then downregulated after terminal differentiation and accumulation of myelin proteins in mature oligodendrocytes (Armstrong et al., 1995) . Myt1 continues to be expressed in germinal zones of the adult CNS and is upregulated in gliomas and following spinal cord traumatic injury (Wrathall et al., 1998) . In vitro, expression of a dominant negative form of Myt1 showed that Myt1 can regulate a critical transition in oligodendrocyte lineage cell development by modulating OP proliferation relative to terminal differentiation and upregulation of myelin gene transcription (Nielsen et al., 2004) .",

Double immunolabeling for cell type-specific antigens was used to characterize cell types with Myt1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2, Fig 3, and Fig 4) . The nuclear pattern of Myt1 immunoreactivity was confirmed by co-localization with DAPI staining of nuclei (data not shown). As expected during demyelination and early remyelination in MHV-infected mice, the density of oligodendrocytes was significantly lower in lesioned areas (Fig. 2B ) and corresponded with a reduction in the density of CC1+ oligodendrocytes in the total white matter area, as compared with PBS controls (Fig. 3C) . Among the mature oligodendrocytes immunolabeled with CC1 only a small proportion exhibited Myt1 immunoreactivity ( Fig. 3C and Fig 4) . The small proportion of Myt1+ CC1+ double labeled cells is consistent with our previous study showing that during CNS development Myt1 immunoreactivity is downregulated after OP cells undergo terminal differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes (Armstrong et al., 1995) .",

Therefore, expression of Myt1 at a more immature lineage stage was examined. Immunolabeling for Musashi1 (Msi1) was used as a marker of adult neural stem cells prior to the OP cell stage (Kaneko et al., 2000; Pincus et al., 1998; Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) . A population of cells with nuclear immunoreactivity for Myt1 was immunolabeled for Msi1 (Fig. 2, panel C) . The cell density of these Myt1+ Msi1+ cells was increased in lesioned white matter, particularly early in the disease progression (Fig. 4) . Msi1 is known to be expressed in reactive astrocytes (Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) , which was confirmed in the MHV lesioned tissues using double immunolabeling for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to identify reactive astrocytes (data not shown). However, reactive astrocytes did not exhibit Myt1 immunoreactivity (data not shown) and so did not complicate the interpretation of the Myt1+ Msi1+ cells as neural stem cells.",

To identify cells with nuclear Myt1 localization relative to myelin-specific gene transcription, immunostaining for Myt1 was combined with in situ hybridization for PLP mRNA (Figs. 5E,F). In the combined protocol, specific signal was maintained although the number of cells identified was reduced, relative to the separate detection methods. Individual cells could be clearly identified as double labeled for Myt1 immunoreactivity and PLP mRNA transcripts in MS tissues ( Fig. 5E and inset), which was not observed in the white matter of control cases (Fig. 5F) . A similar protocol to double label OP cells for PDGF\u03b1R mRNA and Myt1 was not feasible because of the low abundance of PDGF\u03b1R transcripts per cell. Importantly, as in our mouse data of Myt1+ CC1 + cells (Fig. 2-Fig 4) , Myt1 expression in a subset of oligodendrocytes identified by PLP mRNA may indicate ongoing OP differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes and support a potential role for Myt1 in oligodendrocyte regeneration in MS lesions.",

However, this capacity for repair becomes limited with repeated or chronic episodes of demyelination. To better understand how successful remyelination can be accomplished, the current study examines the cellular responses during spontaneous remyelination following transient experimental demyelination. Recent studies have identified an emerging array of transcription factors that are associated with OP proliferation, induction of differentiation toward an oligodendrocyte phenotype, and elevated transcription of myelin-specific genes during myelination (Gohkan et al., 2005; Ligon et al., 2006) . Analysis of developmental myelination has predicted specific transcription factors that have been shown to be involved in oligodendrocyte lineage responses to demyelination (Arnett et al., 2004; Fancy et al., 2004; Watanabe et al., 2004) .",

Interestingly, only nuclear immunoreactivity for Myt1 was observed in the adult mouse tissues, even though a transition to cytoplasmic localization was observed in rat developing oligodendrocytes (Armstrong et al., 1995) . The present quantitative cellular analysis demonstrating Myt1 expression in OP cells extends an earlier report of increased abundance of mRNA transcripts for both Myt1 and PDGF\u03b1R during remyelination following ethidium bromide induced demyelination in rats (Sim et al., 2002) . In addition, similar to our current quantification of Myt1 and BrdU incorporation, our previous MHV study demonstrated that PDGF\u03b1R+ cell proliferation in response to demyelination was localized within and near lesions (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . However, Myt1 is expressed in additional populations of responding cells that were not identified by PDGF\u03b1R immunolabeling. We identified a subset of Myt1 expressing cells by co-immunolabeling for Msi1. Msi1 is an RNA-binding protein that has been used as a marker of neural stem cells in the developing and adult CNS of rodents and humans (Kaneko et al., 2000; Pincus et al., 1998; Sakakibara and Okano, 1997) . Therefore, the initial expression of Myt1 in MHV lesions is expected to be in neural stem cells that may represent a relatively small but potentially important population of cells that is responsive to demyelination.",

Myt1 expression prior to the OP stage has been shown with in vitro analysis of cultured neonatal cells (Armstrong et al., 1995) . In vitro, Myt1 continued to be expressed at the OP stage, followed by downregulation in mature oligodendrocytes after accumulation of myelin proteins (Armstrong et al., 1995) . In vivo, the proliferative response during demyelination has been clearly associated with the OP stage in MHV lesions, other models of experimental demyelination, and MS lesions (Redwine and Armstrong, 1998; Reynolds et al., 2001; Solanky et al., 2001; Watanabe et al., 2002) . In this MHV model, cells that incorporated thymidine analogues, as indicators of proliferation, during demyelination have been shown to express PDGF\u03b1R and then maintain labeling during the transition into oligodendrocytes in the remyelination phase (Godfraind et al., 1989; Redwine and Armstrong, 1998) . In the current MHV study, expression of Myt1 was observed mainly in PDGF\u03b1R+ OP cells and in only a small proportion of CC1+ oligodendrocytes, which may be cells that recently differentiated and had not yet downregulated Myt1.",

Myt1 acted as a transcriptional activator to increase luciferase levels from the promoter of a myelin-specific gene, 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032phosphodiesterase, in transient transfection assays (Nielsen et al., 2004) . However, Myt1 may act in concert with other transcription factors or co-factors that contribute to effects on transcriptional controls (Koyano-Nakagawa et al., 1999; Schneider et al., 2001) . In addition, Myt1 may form complexes with Sin3B, a protein that mediates repression by recruiting histone deacetylases (Romm et al., 2005) . Therefore, the function of Myt1 may depend upon the levels of other nuclear proteins that may be differentially regulated in cells relative to stage of differentiation or environmental context. The current study documenting Myt1 expression corresponding to regenerative responses of the oligodendrocyte line-age in animal models and MS lesions suggests that Myt1 may have functional importance in remyelination.

(B) In a higher magnification of dorsal column white matter from a 2 wpi mouse, the dorsal column border with the gray matter (GM) is noted by white dash marks. Normal CC1 immunolabeling (green) of oligodendrocytes is seen in the deep dorsal column white matter, which is not lesioned. In the more superficial dorsal column region, the lesion area is evident by the lack of CC1 immunolabeled oligodendrocytes (top right of panel) where a high density of Myt1+ CC1\u2212 cells (red) are present (examples at arrow-heads). Along the lesion border, CC1 immunoreactivity is detected in cells with nuclear Myt1 (CC1+ Myt1+ examples at arrows). Scale bar = 50 \u00b5m. The inset shows an enlarged view of several CC1+ cells and a pair of CC1 + Myt1+ cells. Scale bar = 10 \u00b5m. (C) Msi1 immunoreactivity (green) is increased in reactive astrocytes and neural stem cells in the superficial part of the dorsal column white matter of a 2 wpi mouse. Cells expressing Myt1 (red; arrowheads) are more prevalent in the lesion area than in the nonlesioned deep dorsal column white matter. Reactive astrocytes express Msi1 (detected with immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein; data not shown). However, Msi1+ Myt1+ cells (examples at arrows) are likely to be neural stem cells since in these tissues Myt1 was not co-expressed in astrocytes (data not shown). Scale bar = 50 \u00b5m. The inset shows an enlarged view of two cells with cytoplasmic Msi1 and nuclear Myt1 as well as three cells with only nuclear Myt1 immunoreactivity. Scale bar = 10 \u00b5m. (D) The density of OP cells expressing PDGF\u03b1R (green) is increased in the lesioned area of the superficial dorsal column in a 4 wpi mouse. The density of cells with nuclear Myt1 immunoreactivity (red) is also increased in the lesion area. Examples of cells double labeled for PDGF\u03b1R and Myt1 are indicated by arrows while PDGF\u03b1 R-Myt1+ cells are shown by arrowheads. Scale bar = 50 \u00b5m. The inset shows a pair of PDGF\u03b1R1 cells with nuclear Myt1 immunoreactivity. Scale bar = 10 \u00b5m. Quantitative analysis of Myt1 expression relative to cell type specific markers. At 4 wpi with MHV or PBS vehicle, mice were sacrificed and the white matter (WM) of transverse cervical sections was analyzed to determine the density of Myt1 immunolabeled cells in combination with cell type-specific markers. (A) Myt1 expressing immature neural stem cells were detected with Musashi1 (Myt1+ Msi1+). Astrocytes express Msi1 but not Myt1 (i.e. Myt1\u2212 Msi+) and so can be distinguished from neural stem cells (see text). (B) The majority of OP cells expressing PDGF\u03b1R are mostly also immunolabeled for Myt1 (i.e. Myt1+ PDGF\u03b1R+ relative to Myt1\u2212 PDGF\u03b1R+). (C) The density of mature oligodendrocytes, identified by CC1 immunolabeling, is very high in PBS WM but greatly reduced in MHV WM. Relatively few Comparison among cell types exhibiting nuclear Myt1 immunoreactivity in PBS control mice and MHV mice throughout disease progression. OP cells immunolabeled with PDGF\u03b1R were the principal cell type that expressed Myt1. In addition, the population of Myt1+ PDGF\u03b1R+ OP cells increased significantly at 2 wpi (P < 0.001) and 4 wpi (P < 0.001) before returning to PBS control levels at 8 wpi (p > 0.05). Musashi1 (Msi1) neural stem cell marker detected a smaller population of Myt1 expressing cells that was greatest at 2 wpi. Relatively few cells continued to exhibit nuclear Myt1 immunoreactivity after differentiating into mature oligodendrocytes, as indicated by CC1 immunolabeling. PBS, n = 3 mice; MHV, n = 3 mice. Myt1 expression in multiple sclerosis (MS) and control cases. Representative results are shown from adult human brain sections that were immunostained for Myt1 (A-C), processed for in situ hybridization for Myt1 mRNA (D), or analyzed by immunostaining for Myt1 combined with in situ hybridization for proteolipid protein (PLP) mRNA as a marker of oligodendrocytes (E,F). Nuclear immunostaining for Myt1 (brown DAB with pink eosin tissue counter stain) was seen in small round cells in the periplaque white matter (PPWM) adjacent to MS lesions (A, PPWM; case 9, Table 1), at an increased density relative to white matter control areas (B; case 2, Table 1 ). In some MS lesions (C, lesion area; case 6, Table 1), reactive astrocytes exhibited cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for Myt1 (brown DAB with pink eosin tissue counter ",
