We included patients from inpatient and outpatient departments who had ILI and performed MRT between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2016 in a 265-bed private hospital in Istanbul. At the end of 2015, we implemented antimicrobial stewardship including systematic use of MRT. Then, we compared our observations between the year 2015 and the year 2016. We designed the study according to the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) tool. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system (BioFire FilmArray, Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT) which detects 17 viruses and three bacteria was used for diagnosis. In total, 1317 patients were included; 630 (48%) were inpatients and 569 (43%) were older than 16 years of age. At least one virus was detected in 747 (57%) patients. Rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza virus, and adenovirus were the most commonly detected. Among hospitalized patients, in children, a significant decrease in antibiotic use (44.5% in 2015 and 28.8% in 2016, p = 0.009) was observed, but in adults, the decrease was not statistically significant (72% in 2015 and 63% in 2016, p = 0.36). The duration of antibiotic use after the detection of virus was significantly decreased in both children and adults (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). By using MRT, inappropriate antibiotic use and, also, duration of inappropriate antibiotic use after the detection of virus was significantly decreased. It is time to increase the awareness about the viral etiology in respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and implement MRT in clinical practice.",

[3] , a population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia among adults aged 18 years and older was conducted. Human rhinovirus, influenza A and B virus, and hMPV were the most commonly detected viruses in etiology. Influenza virus and rhinovirus were reported to be the most commonly detected viruses in both adults and children in Turkey [12] . Among inpatients older than 16 years of age, 57% had LRTI, and influenza A, rhinovirus, RSV, and hMPV were the most common agents. Among children, 32% had LRTI, and rhinovirus, RSV, and hMPV were the most common agents ( Fig. 2 ; Fig. 2 The most commonly detected viruses among all patients in whom at least one virus was detected. RSV: respiratory syncytial virus; hMPV: human metapneumovirus Table 1 ). Any effort targeted to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics in viral pneumonia could be useful in this era of antibiotic resistance. Because of the high rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescription despite the availability of MRT, we decided to improve training sessions about the diagnosis and management of respiratory system infections at the end of 2015. Then, we performed an observational comparison between the practice in 2015 and 2016. There was a decrease in antibiotic use towards 2016 among all inpatients. However when analyzed separately, a significant reduction in children but not in adults was detected ( Table 2 ). The significant reduction of antibiotic use in children but not in adults could be explained by differences in physicians' experience in MRT. Despite the fact that there was a reduction in antibiotic use in children after the detection of virus, antibiotic prescription rates were still high. In a recent study, the impact of MRT on antibiotic use was investigated and it was seen that antibiotics were still continued in about 75% of the patients, despite the detection of virus. This finding was explained by being a new test [13] . In another study, Afzal et al. [14] reported that a positive result for MRT decreased antibiotic use duration and prescription rate but the decrease in antibiotic prescription was not statistically significant. Timbrook et al. [15] studied MRT in combination with PCT and concluded that a lower level of PCT and detection of virus by MRT were not associated with decreased use of antibiotics in RTIs, but in another study, a lower level of PCT in combination with detection of virus was found to be associated with shortened duration of antibiotic usage [16] . In a randomized controlled study, the effect of both MRT and PCT on antibiotic use was evaluated and the duration of antibiotic use was found to be decreased in cases of viral infection with lower levels of PCT [17] .",
