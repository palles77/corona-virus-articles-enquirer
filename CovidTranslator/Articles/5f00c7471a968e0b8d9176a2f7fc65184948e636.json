The evidence to date links MERS-CoV cases with exposure to camels, including camel products or to probable or confirmed human cases of MERS-CoV. It typically presents as an acute respiratory illness and is associated with a 35% mortality rate. Based on available information at this time, the current risk to Canadians for acquiring MERS-CoV infections is considered low. However, the International Health Regulations Committee concerning MERS-CoV has cautioned that the upsurge of cases seen this past spring (2014) may be predictive of an increase in cases related to the Hajj -an annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia that took place in early October 2014. Although the overall risk is low, the Public Health Agency of Canada and its National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in close collaboration with provincial and territorial partners, the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network (CPHLN) and infection prevention and control experts have developed a number of preparedness guidance documents and protocols to address the risk of an imported case of MERS-CoV in Canada.",

Although the source is not fully understood, there appears to be a close link with the virus found in camels and the persons affected. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause a range of infectious diseases from a mild cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (1) which was responsible for the serious 2003 outbreak in Toronto, Ontario and a number of other countries. MERS-CoV is genetically distinct from the SARS virus and unlike SARS, MERS-CoV does not appear to transmit easily from person to person (2, 3) .",

However, the authors cautioned that MERS-CoV's R0 may increase with population density and may also be affected by community age and contact structure. Cauchemez et al (2013) obtained similar R0 estimates for MERS-CoV epidemic potential, but found that R0 values increased when infection control measures were not in place (14) . In addition, transmissibility may increase in populations with comorbidities and R0's may be underestimated if cases received an intervention soon after onset. The authors concluded that while MERS-CoV is a slowly growing epidemic, intensive public health measures around cases paired with improved diagnostic techniques would be sufficient to contain the spread of the disease and mitigate morbidity and mortality.",
