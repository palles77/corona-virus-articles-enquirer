The case fatality rate was an alarming 33%. Multiple other poultry outbreaks have been noted in Asia in the past 3 yr [4] . More recently, spread of the virus has taken place by migratory bird populations [5] . More than 200 human cases have occurred, with a cumulative case fatality of approximately 50%. Although the current strains of H5N1 are poorly transmissible from human to human, reassortment of genes may occur to allow enhanced infectivity as has happened with other influenza strains and a pandemic could ensue [6] . The World Health Organization has warned that a global pandemic may be at hand.",

Despite medical advances that could possibly mitigate an outbreak, there are many modern factors that will make spread a greater hazard today. Travel may spread the pathogen rapidly and to distant sites. Increasing concentrations of people in densely populated cities will facilitate spread. There are much larger groups of highly immunocompromised patients who likely will have more severe disease and may shed larger numbers of virus particles and for longer durations, which could spread the infection more efficiently to others. These include patients who undergo HSCT and solid organ transplantation. The SARS outbreak had a profound effect on transplantation activities in the Toronto outbreak and necessitated cessation of transplantation activity [7] . It is highly likely that a global pandemic will have serious repercussions on HSCT programs and preparedness and rapid response are important to minimize threat to transplant recipients.",

During nonpandemic years, influenza vaccination of patients after HSCT, families and caregivers of patients after HSCT, and the HSCT program staff should be vigorously encouraged. Currently, there is no H5N1 vaccine available, although research is ongoing. There is a real possibility that early during a pandemic a vaccine will not be available. Accordingly, antivirals are other important tools for prevention and treatment. There are 2 classes of influenza antivirals [9] . The adamantine drugs (amantidine and rimantidine), M2 inhibitors, are effective against influenza type A (but not type B). Unfortunately, H5N1 strains are resistant to amantidine [10] . In contrast, the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, are effective against influenza types A and B, including amantadine-resistant strains. The neuraminidase inhibitors have been used in transplant recipients, found effective for influenza infections, are well tolerated, and lack significant interactions with immunosuppressive regimens. However, emergence of resistance has been reported in patients after HSCT [11] . It is expected that the neuraminidase inhibitors will be important as chemoprophylaxis in the event of an outbreak. One cautionary note is the observation of resistance in some H5N1-infected patients who did not respond to therapy [12] .",

Infected patients or those with symptoms suggestive of infection should be isolated. Visitors or family members who have symptoms of influenza should avoid contact with patients after HSCT. Isolation should be maintained until the threat of shedding dissipates. Health care workers with symptoms suggestive of infections should also avoid contact with patients. During outbreaks aggregation of groups of individuals should be avoided. This will affect waiting areas of clinics and hospitals. Personal protection measures should be emphasized. Such measures include hand washing, wearing of masks, and respiratory hygiene. Ordinary surgical masks may offer protection against droplet transmission (thought to be the major mode of transmission), whereas the high-efficiency N95 mask offers additional protection against airborne transmission (thought to also be a mode of transmission, although much less important). The health care staff is at high risk of infection and should be provided maximal protection measures to optimize their ability to function and maintain morale.",
