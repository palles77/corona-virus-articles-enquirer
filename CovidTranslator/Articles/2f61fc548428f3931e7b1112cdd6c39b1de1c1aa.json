Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignment as well as phylogenetic analysis of all the structural ORFs with reference coronavirus strains showed that CCV 1-71 was highly related to Chinese CCV isolates. This indicates that these CCV stains may have the same ancestor. Two large deletions were found in ORF3 and led to an elongated nsp3a and a truncated nsp3b. A single ''A'' insertion in a 6A stretch resulted in the truncation of nsp7b. The great variation in nsp3b and nsp7b indicates that these proteins are not essential for the viral replication.",

Analysis with NetNGlyc, SignalP and TMHMM showed that it contained 31 highly conserved potential Nlinked glycosylation sites, a putative signal peptide (cleavage sites at positions Cys 18 to Thr 19) and a transmembrane domain (positions 1,393 to 1,415 of S gene). This indicates that the spike protein is a type I membrane protein. The highest amino acids (aa) similarity of the spike protein was with CCV-GP (98.9%) and CCV-V1 (99.1%), two Chinese strains isolated from Giant Panda and dogs. A high level of nucleotide sequence identity ([94.2%) was demonstrated among CCV type II strains, whereas the identity to CCV type I strains was only about 53%. In accordance with previous observations, the sequence of the spike protein had a higher similarity with FCV type II (*96%) than with FCV type I and TGEV strains (*52 and 91%, respectively). The N-terminus of the protein was much more variable than the C-terminus. Analysis of the N-terminal 470 amino acids demonstrated that several residues, such as His-45, Ser-70, Asp-78, Thr-149, Ser-156, Ala-157, His-199, and Ser-394, were unique to CCV 1-71 and the four Chinese strains (GP, V1, HF3, and DF) isolated from different hosts (Giant Pandas, dogs and foxes) of different regions. The residue Leu-44 was present only in CCV 1-71 and TGEV strains. Phylogenetic analyses performed with nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the S protein revealed that CCV 1-71 was more closely related to Chinese strains than to other CCV reference strains (Fig. 2a) .",

Alignment of this region with other CCV, FCV, and TGEV strains showed a high degree of variation.

Another alteration caused by the deletion was the absence of the expected ORF3x designated initially by Horsburgh in 1992 [10] . An ''ATTAC'' sequence was found near the both sides of the deletion region. Another large deletion (31-nt) was found in the expected ORF3b of CCV 1-71, causing the introduction of an early stop codon and the formation of two truncated ORFs, designated 3b1 and 3b2 (411 and 357 nt, respectively, Fig. 3) .",

Several residues in the S protein, such as His-45, Ser-70, Asp-78, Thr-149, Ser-156, Ala-157, His-199, and Ser-394 that are unique for Chinese strains are also found in the S gene of CCV 1-71, which lends further support to this hypothesis. Despite the high sequence identity, two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (Mab N1-2 and N2-1) specific to the S protein of CCV 1-71 cannot prevent infection of susceptive cells with these Chinese strains [25] . This indicates that notable diversity in the antigenicity of S proteins exists. Minor amino acid changes in the sequence of the spike protein have already been demonstrated to alter the virulence or enteric tropism of even very closely related TGEV isolates [26] . Single amino acid substitution in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike glycoprotein has also been confirmed to determine viral entry and immunogenicity of a major neutralizing domain [27] . Analysis of the N-terminal 500 amino acids of the S protein of CCV 1-71 and CCV HF3 demonstrated several amino acid substitutions, such as Leu-44, N-245, S-314, L-373. Whether these substitutions can be responsible for changes in antigenicity and virulence remains to be investigated by analysis of more sequences or by using reverse genetics systems similar to those recently used for FIPV [28] .",

The existence of the truncated ORF3b also indicates that this ORF is not essential for the viral replication. Significant changes in the same region have also been reported in many other coronaviruses like CCV-CB/05 [12] , TGEV-TF1, TGEV-Purdue, and PRCV-ISU-1 [29] . The non-coding regions upstream and downstream of ORF3a were considered to be a ''hot spot region'' where recombination, insertions or more usually deletions can occur at a high frequency [10] . Analysis of the deletion downstream of ORF3a in CCV1-71, CCV-CB/05 and TGEV-Purdue showed that an ''ATTAC'' sequence existed close to the both sides of the deletion region, suggesting that the deletion may be caused by a recombination event. It is also possible that these deletions arose from ''looping out'' of RNA regions, which may further result in the ''skipping'' of viral RNA polymerases during transcription. The search for the transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) in the region between S gene and ORF3a showed a ''TTAAAC'' site, different from the expected ''CTAAAC'', which is highly conserved in group I coronaviruses. Both the nucleotide sequence of TRS and the distance between the TRS 3 0 -end and the initiation codon of first ORF are suggested to play an important role in Fig. 4 Alignment of the nsp7b gene of CCV 1-71 and other CCV reference strains. The site where an extra ''A'' was inserted in a 6A stretch is shown in box the transcription of mRNAs [30] . The single nucleotide mutation in the TRS signal may reduce the transcription and expression of ORF3a. Unlike the intact nsp3b of the virulent CCV BGF10 strain, the nsp3b of CCV 1-71 is truncated in the middle of the sequence. Whether the two truncated ORFs (3b1 and 3b2) can be translated and whether the truncation is involved in changes of virulence need to be further studied. There are evidences in survey studies that the truncation of nsp3b is associated with attenuated strains [10, 31, 32] . Deletions in this ORF have also been suspected to play an important role in viral attenuation [33] .",

The 3 0 one-third genome sequence of CCV1-71, especially the non-structural proteins, has undergone considerable variation during virus evolution. Further cloning and sequence analysis of genomic sequences of more CCV isolates as well as reverse genetics systems are required to reveal a clearer picture of the relationship between virus genome and pathogenicity.",
