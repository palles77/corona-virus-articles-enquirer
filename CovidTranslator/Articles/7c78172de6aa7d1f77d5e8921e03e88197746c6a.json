The results of the study indicate that the most incorporated activities were hand-washing, proper ways of coughing, and discussion on germs. The least incorporated personal health-related activities were proper use of bathroom and keeping things out of the mouth. Reasons for incorporating the activities include helping to curtail the spreading of colds and germs, helping the children to develop good life skills later in life, and helping the preschoolers know about the health hazards associated with germs, among others. The study recommends the need to make Health Education a core component of preschool teachers' training.",

Also, given the close connection that exists between personal cleanliness and children's health, if any headway is to be made toward the minimization or total elimination of some childhood diseases, then scientific studies on personal hygiene among preschoolers are warranted. There is no better place to do such research than in the preschool classroom. A review of the literature on Early Childhood Health Education revealed that not much research has been done concerning personal hygiene topics taught in preschool classrooms. This study fills that vacuum.",

            "text": "The importance of hygiene among preschoolers has attracted the attention of pediatricians and early caregivers. For example, in their study of hygiene levels and their association with infectious diseases among preschoolers, Sherriff and Golding (2002) noted that it is essential for caregivers to operate in a clean environment. The need for caregivers to operate in a clean environment in order to minimize the occurrence and spread of disease is also bolstered by Hagerhed-Engman et al.'s (2006) study in which they discovered a strong connection between daycare attendance and the increased risk for developing respiratory and allergic symptoms. Thompson (1994) draws scholars' attention to the need to pay attention to personal cleanliness measures like handwashing, ways of preventing the spread of bacteria during coughing, proper dental care, among others. He discovered that preschoolers are at high risk for gastrointestinal diseases caused by a large number of enteric pathogens and called for the training and education of caregivers and children in good personal hygiene given the fact that the risk of such diseases is increased by the greater potential for person-to-person transmission within group care. In particular, he called for great emphasis to be placed on frequent hand-washing, separating change areas from food handling and eating areas, and routine cleaning and disinfecting of environmental settings. Kotch et al.'s (2007) work also showed that hand-washing and the availability of diapering equipment reduced disease among children in out-of-home child care centers. The above studies give further credence to the need to take the study of hygiene in preschool settings very seriously.",

Finally, the CDC recommends that in the absence of water and soap, it is essential to use ethanol alcohol-based (a minimum 62%) hand sanitizer, preferably in a gel form.",
