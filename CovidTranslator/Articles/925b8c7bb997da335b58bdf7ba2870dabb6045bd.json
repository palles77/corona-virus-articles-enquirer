The predicted O-glycosylation site consisting of four amino acid residues of Ser -Ser -Thr -Thr is located immediately adjacent to the initiator Met and is well conserved among MHV strains investigated so far. We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of a highly virulent strain MHV-2 M-coding region and demonstrated that MHV-2 had a unique amino acid, Asn, at position 2 at the conserved O-glycosylation site. We also demonstrated that this substitution added N-linked glycans to MHV-2 M protein resulting in increment of molecular mass of MHV-2 M protein compared with JHM strain having only O-linked glycans.",

Among these replacements, the first was found at the hydroxylamino acid cluster forming a potential O-glycosylation site. The amino acid immediately adjacent to the initiator Met was Asn in MHV-2 instead of Ser in A59. Since it was previously reported that the potential O-glycosylation site was well conserved among MHV strains (Homberger, 1994) , the nucleotide sequences of this site of additional MHV strains that had not been investigated, were analyzed.

To test this possibility, expressed MHV-2 M protein was treated with N-glycanase. The treatment with Nglycanase (Fig. 4 , lane 5) resulted in reduced molecular mass compared with MHV-2 M protein control (lane 6). These data indicated that the Although the molecular mechanisms of Nlinked glycosylation are well understood, those of O-linked glycosylation have yet to be studied. In this sense, the M proteins of coronaviruses in group 2 seem to provide a good tool for elucidation of the mechanisms of O-glycosylation, since they have been reported to carry only O-linked oligosaccharides. As we have demonstrated the presence of additional N-linked sugars, careful attention should be paid when using MHV-2 M protein for this purpose.",

Viral assembly, an event in which the M protein plays an important role, is not interfered with by the additional N-glycosylation, since equal efficiency was displayed by both the mutant M protein of A59 with N-linked oligosaccharides and the original A59 M protein lacking N-glycan in assembling in virion-like particles (de Haan et al., 1998a) . MHV-2 does not induce cell-to-cell fusion on cultured DBT cells forming syncytium, as opposed to most MHV strains. However, it seems unlikely that MHV-2 M protein is responsible for non-syncytium formation, since the S protein has been demonstrated to be the only element that determines the phenotype of MHV strain with regard to syncytium formation (Yamada et al., 1997) . The M protein of MHV-2 does not seem to have sufficient role in changing pathogenicity or tissue tropism, since an A59based recombinant virus containing the entire M gene of MHV-2 produced encephalitis and hepatitis similar to parental A59 following intracerebral inoculation (Lavi et al., 1998) . Further investigation is required to elucidate whether the differently modified M protein of MHV-2 is somehow involved in determining the biological characteristics of this particular strain.",

Asterisks indicate the potential O-glycosylation sites. adenine at nucleotide 5 had been substituted by guanine as the nucleotide sequence of JHM was synthesized and inserted into a pGEM vector. Mutated M protein was then expressed in RK cells using the vaccinia virus system along with original MHV-2 M protein. The molecular masses of expressed proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. The expressed MHV-2 M protein (Fig. 4, lane 4) was detected as the same molecular mass as MHV-2 viral M protein. On the other hand, the mutated M protein (lane 3) appeared as 23and 25-kDa species, indicating that Asn to Ser substitution of the second amino acid made the molecular mass of glycosylated MHV-2 M protein as small as JHM-M protein.",
