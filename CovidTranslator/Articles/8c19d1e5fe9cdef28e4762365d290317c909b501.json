Input refers to the institutional and financial resources for education, human resources, supplies, medications, vaccines, diagnostic capacity, and services available. Process refers to the use of those resources, including peer group expectations of professionalism. Outcomes generally include measures of morbidity, mortality, and functional status of the patient and the population. Defining and measuring achievements of national health objectives and targets, the methods of financing services, and the efficiency of organization help to determine quality. Training, supply, and distribution of health personnel are all determinants of access to and quality of care. Continuous and adequate availability of essential preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services, as well as accountability and internal methods of promoting standards, are all elements of the quality of a health service for the individual, the population as a whole, and groups within the population with special needs.",

Peer review within an institution and external evaluation by accreditation or governmental inspection, based on cumulative evidence and the recognized current \"state of the art\", contribute to accountability and improved quality of care. Continuous quality improvement (CQI) among health care teams and organizations includes regular practice assessments, evidence gathering, remediation, and re-evaluation, which will be discussed later in this chapter. The perception of the services by the community, along with the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices of health, are all vital to improvement of health status.",

Systematic review and absorption of new scientific knowledge, technology, and innovations are essential to promote and renew health care methods. Public health serves in a regulatory role to assure high-quality care to the individual and the community. New technology, whether in the form of diagnostic procedures, new drugs, devices, or vaccines, or new types of health personnel, requires evaluation for effectiveness and appropriateness to the system. Technology assessment also involves epidemiological and economic aspects of effectiveness. Failure to continuously monitor developments and to assimilate those that are demonstrably successful is an ethical and management failure which tragically costs many millions of lives from preventable diseases yearly, such as in delayed adoption of well-proven vaccines or tobacco restriction legislation. This is due to political failure even more than professional weakness, and constitutes one of the saddest ethical dilemmas of public health: failure to convince policy makers of the prime importance of health promotion and disease prevention in the health sector.",

Since then, attention has been directed towards the epidemiological shift to NCDs, which are the most common causes of death in low-and medium-income countries. Thus there is a double burden of infectious, nutrition, maternal, and child priorities, alongside the NCDs. The increasing adoption of vaccines such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and rotavirus alongside the standard diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT), poliomyelitis (polio), and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines provides new possibilities to control the major infectious disease killers of children. New technologies such as the advent of antiretroviral treatment for HIV have led to startlingly successful improvements in the quality of life and longevity of HIV/AIDS patients, and the prevention of onward transmission of HIV from mothers to babies and sexual partners.

Fewer complications arise and patient comfort and economic implications are important. As a result, fewer hospital beds are needed for postoperative care than previously thought necessary, while surgical and ambulatory care facilities may need expansion to accommodate the growing elderly populations needing surgical interventions but requiring shorter recovery. This innovation is now accepted as the standard of much of modern surgical care and shows that simple organizational changes can save money and improve patient safety and comfort.",

Since 1988, a network of government and professional bodies has formed a non-profit agency for technology assessment (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, CADTH). This supports the provincial administration of health insurance in resisting professional, commercial, or political pressures to add untested technology or procedures to the health system as covered benefits.

Block budgets for hospitals have been more effective in Canada than in the USA in restraining the proliferation of high-tech equipment. This has led to criticism of the limited access of Canadians to medical technology, such as CT, MRI, and advanced cancer therapies. In the USA, universal application of the diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for Medicare, Medicaid, and most private insurance had the effect of increasing ambulatory surgery very dramatically, from 16 percent of all surgery in 1980 to 80 percent in 2008 of all surgical procedures in community hospitals (i.e., non-federal short-stay hospitals or 85 percent of all hospitals in the country).

Critics also suggest that this may promote altering diagnoses to higher cost units of service. Others think that DRGs, by reducing length of stay, have turned hospitals into intensive care units with ultra-sick patients. Despite these issues, the trend towards short hospital stays and newer approaches to active treatment seems to be compatible with better care and improved outcomes, according to some measures.

Enforcement of public health law may infringe on individual rights by enforcing sanitation, food and drug safety, and supervision of restaurants and catering firms. Laws may allow restriction of civil rights, such as rarely used mandatory treatment of a person with a dangerous contagious disease or mental illness. Freedom of religion may come into conflict with other laws in public health where restrictive practices may deny the use of publicly supported health facilities, as when a religiously affiliated hospital may refuse an abortion procedure in a case of rape. Religious practices or other personal beliefs may endanger others in the community, such as in the refusal to immunize children so that an imported infectious disease may spread among non-immunized people and even affect those who are immunized, as occurs with imported measles cases even when domestic transmission of the disease has previously been eradicated. General legislative provisions applied to public health forbid misleading or unethical advertising. Legislative provisions may also ban advertising for products, such as tobacco, which are legal but may be harmful to health. These laws affect public health but are provisions in other statutes such as the regulation of business enterprises.

Health protective legislation and regulation for sanitation of food, water, and air are fundamental to public health, as is the control of drugs, cosmetics, vaccines, and biologicals, the manufacture of devices, and the licensing of health personnel and facilities. Limitations of legal suits (torts) against manufacturers of vaccines proved to be a successful measure in the USA with the introduction of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) in 1988. This is funded by a modest surcharge tax collected from vaccine manufacturers. It protects both public and private interests while providing a fair compensation system to ensure patients' rights but without jeopardizing immunization to prevent widespread disease, and also protects manufacturers from litigation with high legal costs and excessive compensation awards by the jury system. Promoting healthy behavior through the prudent use of the legal system of regulation and taxation is increasingly utilized to protect the health of the population.

AIDS was initially addressed as a civil liberties issue and not as a public health problem. Screening, reporting, and case contact follow-up were seen as an invasion of privacy and proved counterproductive by increasing resistance to and avoidance of testing. Protection of privacy and an educational approach were adopted as most feasible and acceptable.

The solidarity principle of socially shared responsibility for funding universal access to health care is based on equitable prepayment for health care for all by nationally regulated mechanisms through place of work or general revenues of government. A society may see universal access to health care as a positive value, and at the same time utilize incentives to promote the use of services of benefit to the individual, such as hospital care, immunization, and screening programs. Some services may be arbitrarily excluded from health insurance, such as dental care, although this is to the detriment of children and a financial hardship for many. Strategies for program inclusion are often based on historical precedent rather than cost-effectiveness or evidence. While efforts are being made to include more children in the program, the Medicaid system in the USA defines eligibility at income levels of 185 percent of the poverty line, thus excluding a high percentage of the working poor.

Relevant, rigorous research of better quality will tend to be cited more frequently, and thus editorial strategies that look for quality and relevance in the given field will increase the impact factor. However, there can also be potential distorting factors. Publishing a highly controversial paper can result in high citation levels. Publishing studies which demonstrate negative findings may be less likely to attract large numbers of citations.",

Similar tactics are used in other areas where health and commercial interests collide. Clear statements of potential conflicts of interest are essential. Journal owners must not interfere in the evaluation, selection, or editing of individual articles, either directly or by creating an environment in which editorial decisions are strongly influenced.",

Public health ethics inquiry carries out three core functions:(1) identifying and clarifying the ethical dilemma posed, (2) analyzing it in terms of alternative courses of action and their consequences, and (3) resolving the dilemma by deciding which course of action best incorporates and balances the guiding principles and values. \"(CDC, 2001)",

            "text": "also with the perpetrating country and its culture. The Nazi Holocaust has had downstream effects in public health in the German-speaking countries which last to the present time, seven decades since the events took place. The longterm damage done to public health in Germany and Austria is described in Box 15.16.The Nuremberg Doctors' Trial in 1946-47 convicted many leading Nazi physicians of crimes against humanity and resulted in severe punishments including hanging or long prison terms. This trial was a seminal event in establishing the ethical standards required for medical research and human rights. However, many in the medical profession aligned with these horrors remained leading figures in the German medical community, one even being elected to head the World Medical Association, then discussing the Helsinki Declaration of Ethics in Biomedical Research, before being forced to resign. The Nuremberg Trials and the subsequent Helsinki Declaration laid the fundamentals of biomedical ethics for the following generations, regulated by requirements of ethical procedures and institutional research board approvals for funding, conducting, and publishing research involving human subjects (Table 15 .7).The United Nations Convention on Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (UNGC) of 1948 defines acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, members of a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group as crimes against humanity. This convention specifies that incitement to genocide is itself a crime against humanity. Legal action should focus on state-sanctioned incitement as a recognized early warning sign. The UNGC defines genocidal acts to include the following as punishable under international law: l genocide l conspiracy to commit genocide l direct and public incitement to commit genocide l attempt to commit genocide l complicity in genocide.The reappearance of genocide in the late twentieth century in the Balkans and Rwanda, and in the twenty-first century by Sudanese in Darfur, highlights genocide as a public health concern and its prevention as a public health and international political responsibility. Incitement to genocide is a crime against humanity and was the basis for the trials and convictions of leaders of the Rwandan Tutsi tribe, as well as inciters to ethnic violence and the political leaders and perpetrators of mass murders in the former Yugoslav Republic. The threat and practice of genocide are still present, whether in the murderous raids of Sudanese Janjaweed militias in Darfur and South Sudan, the threats of genocide by Iran and associated terrorist organizations against Israel and Jews in general, or the killing of Christians in northern Nigeria and Egypt, of Muslims in Burma/Myanmar, and others. Incitement to genocide is now common as part of international discourse.Genocide represents the most extreme assault on the right to life and respect for life. In the twentieth century, an estimated 200 million people perished through genocide. Totalitarian dictatorships, past wars, and ideologies of exclusiveness, ethnic purity, and religious fundamentalism increase the risks for genocide. Perpetrators use dehumanizing, demonizing, and delegitimizing hate language to desensitize or intimidate bystanders and to mobilize, order, and instruct followers.Genocide prevention requires international surveillance networks for monitoring and reporting incitement and hate language in the media, textbooks, places of worship, and the Internet, which should monitor and identify their sources l Precautionary principle -decision makers have a general duty to take preventive action to avoid harm even before scientific certainty has been established. l Failure to act -public health officials and policy makers have a duty to act and implement preventive health measures demonstrated to be effective, safe, and beneficial to population health. Failure to enforce public health regulations with resulting disease or deaths may constitute negligence on the part of responsible officials with civil or criminal penalties. ",
