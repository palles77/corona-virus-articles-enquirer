Recent studies showed that lycorine exhibits antiviral [2, 3] , anti-inflammatory [4] , antimalarial [5] and antitumor [6] effects. More importantly, it has been reported that lycorine displayed significantly higher antiproliferative activity in cancer cells than in normal cells [7] , thus it could be a promising anticancer drug in the future. However, lycorine's poor solubility both in oil and water would restrict its clinical use. Therefore, a suitable formulation of lycorine which can improve its solubility and be applied in the future clinical treatment is highly desirable.",

LNEs are Ivyspring International Publisher nano-scale oil in water emulsions, which has a central oil core and could be stably dispersed in water. LNEs droplet sizes are in the range of 20-200 nm and show narrow size distribution [8] . Due to the small droplet size, this formulation can be stable for a long time against sedimentation and creaming, hence offering increased stability [9] . Such long-term stability makes it suitable for commercial use [10] , especially for drug delivery [11, 12] . However, non-targeted LNEs loaded with lycorine which can be taken up by normal cells could still cause undesired side effects. A targeted LNEs delivery system with specificity would minimize side effects to normal cells.",

This is due to the fact that rapid proliferation of tumor cells increased their need for nutrients compared with normal cells, which resulted in the over-expression of lectin-like receptors that encompass high affinity for polysaccharide moieties including mannose, galactose and lactose [15] . Therefore, mannosylated nanoparticles can target to tumor cells due to the preferential uptake by receptor-mediated internalization via lectin receptors on the surface of tumor cells [16] . As a result, using mannosylated LNEs as carriers for the anticancer drug lycorine may probably increase its tumor cellular uptake.",

This study aimed at increasing the lipophilicity of lycorine. According to the structure of lycorine, the method of ion-pair formation could be used. This method was used to modify the lipophilicity of ionizable drugs by shielding their charge with an oppositely charged ion without chemical modifications [20, 21] . Generally, the protonated nitrogen on the ring of lycorine bears positive electrostatic charge, and the carboxyl group of fatty acid provides negative charge. As a consequence, lycorine and fatty acid can form ion-pair complex and the long carbon chain brought by the fatty acid can enhance the lipophilicity of lycorine. In this study, oleic acid (OA) could be employed as the counter ion because it is a biodegradable and physiological long chain fatty acid with low toxicity.",

            "text": "However, both the acidity of OA and the basicity of lycorine are very weak, bringing difficulty in forming ion-pair formation. Complex formation is generally driven by electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding. Electrostatic force dominates the interactions between polar molecules. Solvents with low dielectric constant are favored for ion pair formation [22] . In this study, tetrahydrofuran (with low dielectric constant of 7.58) was chosen as the solvent not only to provide sufficient solubility for LYC, OA and their complex, but also to facilitate this ion pair formation. In addition, if a little water exists in this solvent, such ion-pair could not form. This may be due to the fact that the dieletric constant of water is as high as 78.5, which is not suitable for ion-pair forming. Moreover, the acidity of water (pKa = 7) is stronger than that of oleic acid (pKa = 9.85). Thus under the condition where water exists, the dissociation of oleic acid will be inhibited to some extent hence inhibit the ion-pair formation. On the contrary, if the solvent was dried first, such ion-pair could form. This is because tetrahydrofuran is a type of polar aprotic solvent, which facilitates the dissocia-tion of OA hence enhanced its acidity. After the carboxylate ion of OA attacked the protonated nitrogen on lycorine, LYC-OA was formed. The postulated structure of this ion-pair complex is shown in Fig. 2 .",

Fig. 6 shows the confocal microscopy images of A549 cells after being exposed to F-M-LNEs (Fig. 6A) , F-LNEs (Fig. 6B ) or F-M-LNEs plus 0.125 mg/ml mannan (Fig. 6C ) at 37 \u2103 for 1 hour. Formulations showed green fluorescent stains; nuclei were stained with DAPI and showed blue fluorescent stains. Cells exposed to coated LNEs (Fig. 6A) depicted stronger intracellular green fluorescent intensity than that exposed to uncoated LNEs (Fig. 6B) suggesting mannose coating could cause more cellular uptake of LNEs. This may due to the fact that uncoated LNEs were taken up by A549 cells through nonspecific endocytosis, whereas the mannosylated LNEs can be taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. What's more, cells incubated with coated LNEs plus 0.125 mg/ml mannan (Fig. 6C ) resulted in weaker intracellular fluorescent than that incubated with coated LNEs alone. This may be due to the preferential binding of mannan with mannose receptor saturating them and suppressed the entry of mannosylated LNEs via receptor-mediated endocytosis. These results suggested that the increased cellular uptake of coated LNEs was attributed to the lectin receptors-mediated endocytosis [26] [27] [28] . ",

The intracellular fluorescent intensity in A549 cells which were exposed to F-M-LNEs, F-LNEs or F-M-LNEs plus 0.125 mg/ml mannan for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C is shown in Fig. 7A . The cells incubated with mannosylated LNEs showed higher fluorescent intensity than those incubated with uncoated LNEs as well as the coated LNEs plus 0.125 mg/ml manna. The mean fluorescent intensity of cells after above treatments were 2222.2 \u00b1 99.1, 1799.6 \u00b1 52.3, 1816.8 \u00b1 72.7 respectively. This may be attributed to the receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by internalization of the nanoparticles. Such result agreed with the study of intracellular distribution of formulations by confocal microscopy. Fig. 7B shows intracellular fluorescent intensity in CHO cells which were exposed to F-M-LNEs or F-LNEs for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. Mannosylated LNEs could not be taken up by CHO cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis because mannose receptors are not expressed on their membrane [29] . The intracellular fluorescent intensity in CHO cells exposed to F-M-LNEs or F-LNEs showed no significant difference, which further indicated the preferential uptake of F-M-LNEs on A549 cells may be attributed to the receptor-mediated endocytosis [30] .

            "text": "MTT assay was performed to test the growth inhibition activity of free lycorine, LYC-OA-LNEs, M-LYC-OA-LNEs and M-LYC-OA-LNEs plus 0.125 mg/ml mannan on A549 cell lines. MTT will produce a dark blue formazan product when incubated with living cells. DMSO will dissolve such product then shows blue color. The number of living cells after 72 hours of incubation is directly proportional to the intensity of such blue color, which can be measured quantitatively by spectrophotometry. The survival curves of A549 cells showed that at the concentration range of 1.25-10 \u03bcmol/L, the inhibition percentage increased when the concentration of LYC either in free form or incorporated in LNEs was increased (Fig.8A) . What's more, such inhibition percentage showed the trend as: M-LYC-OA-LNEs> LYC-OA-LNEs>free LYC at the concentration of 10 \u03bcmol/L (Fig.8B) . LYC showed the worse activity may be due to its poor lipophilicity that limited its cellular uptake; whereas by making LYC-OA ion-pair, the lipophilicity of LYC was enhanced and after incorporating them into lipid nano-emulsions, the inhibition activity of LYC-OA-LNEs was accordingly better than that of LYC. M-LYC-OA-LNEs showed best activity may be due to the mannose on the nanoparticles promoted better internalization with the lectin receptors on A549 cells hence enhanced its cellular uptake. Such result consisted with the study of intracellular distribution of formulations by confocal microscopy as well as the cell uptake study by flow cytometry. In addition, blank LNEs exhibited even nontoxicity under various concentrations, suggesting the lipid matrix of LNEs used in this study was well tolerated under formulation concentrations. Moreover, at the concentration range of 1.25~5 \u03bcmol/L, the inhibition rate of M-LYC-OA-LNEs plus 0.125 mg/ml mannan was close to that of LYC-OA-LNEs, indicating the receptor-mediated endocytosis of M-LYC-OA-LNEs was suppressed by the competitive inhibition effect of 0.125 mg/ml mannan. At the high drug concentration of 10 \u03bcmol/L, the inhibition activation of M-LYC-OA-LNEs plus 0.125 mg/ml mannan was close to that of M-LYC-OA-LNEs. The most probable interpretation is that the existing of high concentration of coated LNEs compromised the competitive inhibition effect of 0.125 mg/ml mannan, thus the receptor-mediated endocytosis of M-LYC-OA-LNEs was not suppressed. Table 3 . M-LYC-OA-LNEs showed significant higher IC50 than LYC-OA-LNEs (p<0.001), also LYC-OA-LNEs showed significant higher IC50 than LYC (p<0.001). M-LYC-OA-LNEs could be a promising formulation for tumor targeting delivery of LYC by parenteral administration. First of all, the excipients such as OA, soybean oil are of low toxicity and clinically available for parenteral usage [31] . Secondly, LNEs have already been used as drug delivery systems for administration through intravenous injection for the purposes of nutrition (e.g. administration of fats), delivery of vaccines, gene carriers, controlled drug release and targeting of drugs to specific sites either the hepatic system or a tumorized organ in the body [32] . Nano-emulsions are advantageous for intravenous administration, because of the strict requirements of this route of administration, especially the necessity for a formulation droplet size lower than 1 \u03bcm [8] . Although lectin receptors are also expressed on other cells rather than tumor cells (e.g. dendritic cells), sugar modified LNEs could still targeting to tumor site. This is because such nano-formulations can be passively accumulated in tumor tissue though EPR effect, followed by lectin receptor mediated tumor cell uptake. Govind P.Agrawal's group demonstrated that using N-Octadecyl-D-mannosylamine as the mannose coating for nanoparticle drug delivery systems facilitated the delivery of anti-cancer drug to tumor site with reduced access to normal tissue [16] . In addition, the in vitro experiments in current study proved increased tumor cell uptake and tumor cell growth inhibition activity of this coated formation compared with LYC and uncoated ones, suggesting these particles can ferry LYC selectively to tumor tissue and reduce its side effect when used in future clinic.",
