            "text": "There are currently five coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus) known to infect humans: the four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43, and the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). HCoVs 229E and OC43 were discovered in the 1960s. [1] [2] [3] Studies of cell and organ culture, serology, and human volunteer challenges performed in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrated that infection with 229E and OC43 was associated with viral replication and interference with ciliary action, as well as upper respiratory tract illness and a marked antibody rise. [4] [5] [6] [7] Humans infected with HCoVs displayed a wide range of symptoms, with many also asymptomatic. In late 2002, the emergence of SARS-CoV fueled concern about the virulence and possible unrecognized burden of illness due to HCoVs. 8 Soon after the outbreak of SARS ended, HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 were identified. [9] [10] [11] [12] Although HCoVs were typically detected among individuals with upper respiratory illnesses (i.e., \"the common cold\") 4, 7, 13, 14 , some reports have suggested that they may have a role in pediatric lower respiratory infections and hospitalizations [15] [16] [17] [18] . In contrast, several recent publications that included asymptomatic controls for comparison have questioned whether HCoVs have any role in severe respiratory illness and hospitalization among young children. [19] [20] [21] However, these studies were limited by relatively small sample size, short study duration, and single geographic site.",

The most frequently detected species, OC43, tended to emerge in fall and peak in winter whereas NL63, the next most common species, tended to emerge in winter and peak in spring. Aside from one cluster during the winter months of 2003-04, HKU1 was uncommon during the five seasons. 229E was only observed during winter months and was not detected at all between April 2001 and February 2004. No notable differences were observed in the seasonal detection rates for HCoV between the three study sites during each of the five years of surveillance, although the sample sizes were small (data not shown).",

No statistically significant increase was observed in the rates of detection for HCoV or for any of the four individual species of HCoV among the hospitalized cases when compared with the controls, regardless of whether the 27% of hospitalized children who were coinfected with IV, RSV, HPIV, or HMPV, were excluded. The children hospitalized for ARI/fever in whom HCoV alone was detected appeared to be less severely ill than children with IV, RSV, HPIV, or HMPV infections, and the particular association observed between species NL63 and croup was consistent with other studies [27] [28] [29] . In addition, children coinfected with HCoV and other respiratory viruses were clinically similar to those infected only with IV, RSV, HPIV, or HMPV. This suggests that the other viruses rather than HCoV were responsible for the hospitalization.",

[19] [20] [21] A 2004-05 study from Thailand among patients of all ages and asymptomatic outpatient controls found no association between HCoV infection and hospitalization for pneumonia. 19 However, they observed fewer cases, with detection rates of 1.8% among cases and 2.1% among controls, and the number of asymptomatic controls enrolled was relatively small compared with our study (280 over one year versus 742 over two years). A more recent study comparing hospitalized Alaskan Native children less than three years of age and asymptomatic community controls found HCoV detection rates were the same for cases and controls (4%). 20 In a prospective community-based birth cohort study, species 229E and OC43 were detected at similar frequencies among symptomatic (5.5%) and asymptomatic children (4.4%), and neither species was detected in a specimen taken during an ARI episode that required hospitalization. 21 In contrast to our study, a three-year study of pediatric and adult inpatients and outpatients from the United Kingdom noted that 1.71% of those with lower respiratory tract infection were singly infected with HCoV compared with 1.08% among those with no respiratory symptoms. 18 However, the age distribution and sample size for those without symptoms were not described and a test for statistical significance was not provided.",

            "text": "Limitations of our study include the fact that the three geographic areas in this study may not be representative of the rest of the United States. Also, we did not assess bacterial coinfections or antibiotic use, which could have impacted the clinical outcomes for those children who were hospitalized. Our study did not collect data about respiratory symptoms before or after enrollment. Both cases and controls may have tested positive for HCoV from a very recent infection and developed symptoms after enrollment. Since prior studies have noted that HCoV may be shed at least 14 days after acute infection 30, 31 , it is possible that controls with HCoV detected may have been shedding HCoV from a recent, symptomatic infection. However, this is also true for the hospitalized children, and few children with HCoV had medically-attended visits for respiratory illness in the month prior to enrollment. Another possible limitation is that asymptomatic children were not enrolled year-round, but the peak periods of HCoV circulation were included. Finally, we did not test the controls for the additional respiratory viruses for which the hospitalized children were tested. This large prospective, multicenter, population-based study of HCoV infections among both cases and controls over several seasons found no association between hospitalization for ARI/fever and HCoV infection. This type of study, however, cannot rule out the possibility that the infection was causal in a subset of the children. It is possible that host factors are of primary importance in responding to HCoV infections, and further study of the relevance of host or other co-factors in symptomatic illness would help move the field forward. Furthermore, since very few studies of the known HCoVs have included a robust sample size, multiple years, and a control group, more studies would be helpful to verify the findings of this study. Given the low prevalence of hospitalized HCoV cases, the frequency of viral coinfection, and the differences in yearly circulation patterns, conducting future studies with larger numbers of cases and well-matched controls will be challenging. However, new multipathogen PCR platforms may provide opportunities for future studies of respiratory disease that include HCoV. Biopsy and autopsy studies with in situ identification of HCoV and microscopic assessment of fatal cases might also help elucidate viral etiology. Studies utilizing a variety of research strategies are needed to better delineate the role of HCoV infections among children.",
