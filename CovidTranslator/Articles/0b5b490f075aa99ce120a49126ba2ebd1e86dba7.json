Nonetheless, little is known about immune status of pigs that remain PCV2 subclinically infected. Thus, seven pigs successfully infected in an experimental inoculation and without developing disease and nine control non-inoculated pigs were examined. Serological, virological and immunological determinations were done throughout ten weeks post-infection (PI). At week 3 PI, inoculated animals presented the peak of viremia and produced higher levels of IL-10 than the controls; correlation between viral load and IL-10 amounts was observed (p < 0.05). Also, the ratio IgM/IgG suffered a shift skewing IgM production towards an IgG response. By 10 weeks PI, levels of IL-10 disappeared and the viremia decreased. In summary, subclinically PCV2-infected pigs developed a transient PCV2-specific IL-10 response during the viremic phase of infection which coincided with the inversion of the IgM/IgG ratio.",

Moreover, PMWS-like clinical signs were never observed on the farm and, although the farm was known to be enzootically infected by PCV2, all piglets had no detect- able PCV2 maternal antibody titres at the moment of their housing, assessed by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) technique (Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000) . Pigs were distributed in two groups: group A with PCV2 experimentally inoculated pigs (n = 7), and group B with healthy non-inoculated pigs (n = 9). Group A pigs were inoculated with 2.5 ml of the PCV2 strain Burgos (10 4.7 TCID 50 /ml, intranasal) while control group received the same volume of sterile saline as placebo. To obtain the viral inoculum, swine kidney (SK) cells were inoculated with a tissue homogenate prepared from tissues (lymph nodes, spleen, liver and kidney) of a PMWS affected pig. After two serial passages, culture supernatants were recovered, clarified by centrifugation at 650g, and further ultracentrifuged at 100.000g. The viral pellet was resuspended in DMEM, titrated in non-infected SK cells, aliquoted and frozen at \u00c080\u00b0C until used. The inoculum was shown to be free of PRRSV, PPV, and PCV1, by PCR. Detection of total anti-PCV2 antibodies was weekly monitored by means of IPMA technique. Virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies were detected by Ig capture ELISAs (Ingezim PCV IgG \u00d2 and Ingezim PCV IgM \u00d2 , Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain) as manufacturer's recommendations.",

IL-2 was only produced by PBMC of two out of the nine uninfected animals, 73 pg/ml and 22 pg/ml, respectively, being these last values very close to the detection limit of the ELISA.

This event also concurred with the peak of faecal shedding of virus. As shown before in clinically diseased animals (Stevenson et al., 2006) , IL-10 seems to play an important role in the development of PMWS. Results of the present study suggest that recovering of PCV2-infection is related to the ceasement of virus-specific IL-10 responses. In contrast, other studies showed that in diseased animals, this cytokine still predominates at later stages . However, it is unclear whether IL-10 production is a consequence of viral replication or if it is the triggering event that allows the virus to replicate more efficiently.",

In the course of a viral infection an increase of IFN-gamma levels is expected to occur as result of T cell-mediated immune response. However, for subclinically infected inoculated pigs this was not observed. A possible reason for this lack of IFN-gamma production could be the induction of IL-10 responses in the experimental pigs. This cytokine may have a inhibitory or regulatory effect on the production of TH1 cytokines. This is in contrast to previous observations in diseased animals for which the levels of IFN-gamma were notably higher (Darwich et al., 2003b) . Whether this increase of IFN-gamma could be indicative or not of the stage of development of the disease remains unclear. On the other hand, no IL-2 production was detected in supernatants of PCV2-infected pigs, indicating a specific impairment of this cytokine in infected pigs. The slight detection of IL-2 in supernatants of only two control animals can be considered as an unspecific stimulation of these samples. Moreover, no IL-4 production was observed in PBMC cultures of subclinically pigs, presenting the same pattern of clinically PMWS affected pigs (Sipos et al., 2004) . Previous data have shown that in vitro co-cultures of PBMC and PCV2 induced an impairment in the secretion of IL-2 and IL-4 cytokines, even after PHA stimulation (Darwich et al., 2003b) , indicating some type of down-regulation induced by PCV2. Thus, the IL-4 down-shift should be considered an effect of the PCV2 infection but it does not seem to be involved in the development of PMWS.",
