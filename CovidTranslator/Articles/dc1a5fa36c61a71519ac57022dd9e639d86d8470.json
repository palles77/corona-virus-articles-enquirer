Here immunodominant neutralizing epitopes of PEDV were identified using a panel of S-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Ten of eleven S-specific mAbs successfully neutralized PEDV infectivity in vitro. Notably, epitope mapping by peptide ELISAs revealed that nine of these mAbs recognized linear neutralizing epitopes located in the N-terminus of the S2 glycoprotein subunit (amino acids [aa] 744-759, 747-774 and/or 756-771). Additionally, one mAb recognized a neutralizing epitope located in the C-terminus of S2 (aa 1371-1377), while only one neutralizing mAb reacted against a region of the S1 glycoprotein subunit (aa 499-600). Notably, mAbs that recognized epitopes within the S2 subunit presented the highest neutralizing activity against PEDV. Together these results indicate that the S2 glycoprotein subunit contains major antigenic determinants and, perhaps, the immunodominant neutralizing epitopes of PEDV.",

The S protein is expressed as a 1386 amino acid (aa) precursor protein that is cleaved by host proteases into two major subunits: the S1 subunit (residues 20-729) that mediates virus attachment to the cell surface receptor; and the S2 subunit (residues 730-1386) involved in virus and host cell membrane fusion. Like other coronavirus' S proteins, the PEDV S is a type I membrane glycoprotein that forms homotrimeric projections (spikes) on the virion surface and contains an N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1-18), a large extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain (residues 1328-1350) and a short cytoplasmic tail (residues 1351-1386) . The S1 subunit has been shown to have a modular architecture with four discrete domains, including an N-terminal domain (NTD; residues 19-233) that exhibits sialic acid binding activity and a C-terminal domain (CTD; residues 477-629) that can interact with protein receptor(s) . The S2 subunit presents the typical structural features found in class I fusion proteins, including a hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP, residues 891-908), two heptad repeat regions (HR1, residues 978-1117 and HR2, residues 1274-1313), and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 1328-1350) (aa positions based on PEDV strain CO13 S sequence, GenBank accession no. KF272920) . The homotrimeric S proteins on the virion surface are uncleaved and undergo proteolytic processing required for fusion during entry (Shirato et al., 2011; Wicht et al., 2014) .",

The reactivity of select (n=11) mAbs was assessed by IFA against the prototype PEDV strain USA/Colorado/2013 (Marthaler et al., 2013) and the S-INDEL strain USA/Iowa106/2013 (Oka et al., 2014) (Fig. 1) . Additionally, their neutralizing activity was assessed by fluorescent focus neutralization (FFN) assay, with supernatants from nine hybridomas presenting neutralizing titers between 4 and 16 (data not shown). These hybridoma lines were subcloned by limiting dilution (10 \u22121 to 10 -12 ) and further characterized in our study. One additional hybridoma cell line (SD33-1; Fig. 1 ) secreting S-specific mAbs that did not neutralize PEDV and another line previously established at the SD Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (SD37-11) (unpublished data) were also included in our study. Following subcloning one-to-two clones of each primary hybridoma line was selected and subjected to ascites production (Envigo, Inc.).

On Western blots, ten of eleven mAbs recognized the full-length spike protein in whole PEDV lysates (Fig. 2 ) and the truncated S protein spanning the S1-S2 junction region (aa 630-800) (Fig. 2) . Notably while mAb SD37-11 did not recognize the full-length spike in whole virus lysates, mAb SD125-2 did not react with the S1-S2 recombinant protein (aa 630-800) (Fig. 2) . None of the mAbs reacted with the recombinant N protein (Fig. 2) . The reactivity of the mAbs with the S protein under denaturing Western blot conditions indicate that they recognize linear epitopes, with most of them being specific for epitopes within the S1-S2 junction region (Fig. 2) . When tested by ELISA, all mAbs reacted against PEDV strains CO13 (Fig. 3A ) and ten of eleven (except for SD125-2) reacted with S-INDEL strain Iowa106 ( Fig. 3A and B). These results corroborate the findings of the IFA assays, confirming the reactivity of the mAbs with PEDV. Next, we assessed the reactivity of the mAbs against truncated versions of the S protein (aa 499-600 and aa 630-800). Notably, nine of eleven mAbs reacted against the S1-S2 region (aa 630-800), with mAb SD131-3 also reacting with the product corresponding to aa 499-600, which contains the putative receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit ( Fig. 3C and D). These results confirmed the Western blots findings, indicating that most mAbs developed here specifically recognize epitopes located in the S1-S2 junction of the S protein. It is important to note that, while mAb SD125-2 reacted with whole PEDV strain CO13 (Figs. 1, 2 and 3A), it did not recognize the S1-nor the S1-S2 truncated proteins ( Fig. 3C and D) , suggesting that this mAb may recognize another region of the S protein. Additionally, mAb SD131-3 reacted with S1-S2 protein on Western blot and with the S1 and S1-S2 truncated proteins on ELISAs, suggesting a mixed hybridoma population.",

As shown in Fig. 5C eight mAbs recognized epitope 744-759 (SD37-11, SD121-1, SD129-3, SD129-5, SD-131-3, SD137-90, SD138-108, and SD142-2), while only two MAbs recognized epitope 756-771 (SD120-5 and SD129-5). A summary of the epitope specificity of individual mAbs is presented in Table 2 and Fig. 6 . Notably, two mAbs specific to the S1-S2 region (SD37-11 and SD121-1) recognized only epitope 744-759, four mAbs (SD131-3, SD137-90, SD138-108 and SD142-2) recognized both epitopes 744-759 and 747-774, while two mAbs (SD120-1 and SD129-5) recognized epitopes 756-771 and 747-774 ( Fig. 6 ; Table 2 ). These results indicate that the amino terminus of the S2 subunit protein contains highly antigenic, perhaps, immunodominant neutralizing epitopes of PEDV, and further suggest that epitope 744-759 may represent a core neutralizing epitope within S1-S2 junction region (Fig. 6 ).",

Notably, most neutralizing mAbs developed here specifically recognized a truncated form of the S protein (aa 630-800) spanning the S1-S2 junction region (Fig. 2) . To assess whether the neutralizing activity of the mAbs correspond to their ability to recognize this region of the S, the correlation between endpoint FFN and ELISA titers was determined. As shown in Fig. 7A , endpoint neutralizing and S1-S2 ELISA titers were similar for all mAbs, resulting in a strong positive correlation between FFN and ELISA (R 2 = 0.704; Fig. 7B ) test results. Notably, neutralizing titers detected in convalescent polyclonal swine serum also presented a high correlation with antibody titers detected by the S1-S2 Fig. 2 . Immunoreactivity of PEDV specific monoclonal antibodies for linear epitopes of the S protein. Purified whole PEDV preparations (WV, full length S:~150 kDa, cleaved S1/S2:~80 kDa), recombinant S (S1-S2; aa 630-800, S:~24 kDa) and recombinant nucleocapsid (N,~49 kDa) proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 4-20% gradient acrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted into nitrocellulose membranes and probed with each PEDV S-specific mAb. Swine convalescent serum (\u03b1-PEDV) was used as positive control. Blots were developed with a chemiluminescent method. Swine convalescent serum (\u03b1-PEDV) was used as positive control and anti-PRRSV mAb SDOW-17 was used as a negative control. Each mAb was subjected to 2-fold dilutions (1:20-1:160) and tested in three independent experiments. All antibodies were initially diluted to a working solution of 3 mg/mL.

Neutralizing antibodies directed against the S protein likely play a key role on protection against PEDV infection. A recent study demonstrated that neutralizing activity against PEDV in colostrum and milk correlated with levels of IgA antibodies to the S protein (S1 and S2 subunits) . Notably, at least four neutralizing regions have been identified in the S protein (Chang et al., 2002; Cruz et al., 2006; Cruz et al., 2008; Li et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2007) . Recently, a neutralizing domain was identified in the NTD/S0 region of the S1 subunit (Li et al., 2017) , with other epitope(s) mapping to a domain in S1 that is homologous to the collagenase resistant fragment (CO-26 K) of TGEV S (Godet et al., 1994) (aa 499-638; named \"collagenase equivalent\" in PEDV, COE) (Chang et al., 2002; Li et al., 2017) . A region spanning the S1-S2 junction (aa 638-789) in PEDV S contains other neutralizing epitope(s) (Sun et al., 2007) , with a well defined neutralizing epitope mapping to the carboxy-terminus of the S protein (aa 1371-1377) (Cruz et al., 2006 (Cruz et al., , 2008 . Results here showing the specificity of ten PEDV neutralizing mAbs for these domains in the S protein confirm that epitopes located in these regions are indeed responsible for eliciting neutralizing antibodies against PEDV. The fact that these mAbs were generated by immunization of mice with whole virus preparations indicates that these regions are highly antigenic, further suggesting that epitopes within these regions may represent immunodominant neutralizing epitopes of the PEDV S protein.",

Notably, antibodies directed against both S subunits have been correlated with neutralization of PEDV infectivity . Immunization of mice with inactivated whole PEDV virion preparations followed by somatic cell fusion here resulted in production of hybridoma cell lines secreting mAbs specific for the PEDV S protein and capable of neutralizing the virus infectivity in vitro (titers ranging from 1:40 to 1:640). Interestingly, epitope mapping ELISAs revealed that most mAbs developed here (ten of eleven) specifically recognized epitopes located within the S2 subunit (SD37-11, SD120-1, SD121-1, SD125-2, SD129-3, SD129-5, SD131-3 SD137-90, SD138-108 and SD142-2), while only one mAb (SD131-3) reacted with the S1 subunit ( Fig. 3C and D) . While UV-or formalin inactivated PEDV virions likely do not retain the exact antigen conformation and architecture of infective PEDV particles, the data here suggest that the S2 subunit contains immunodominant antigenic determinants of PEDV. Results from a recent study showing higher levels of S2-specific IgG antibodies when compared to S1-specific antibodies in serum and colostrum of sows naturally infected with PEDV, further support this hypothesis . Nevertheless, antibodies against the S1 subunit also play a critical role on immune responses against PEDV , and immunization with the recombinant S1 protein subunit have induced neutralizing antibodies and passive protection against infection (Oh et al., 2014) . Similar experiments, however, have to be performed with the S2 subunit to assess its immunogenicity and to determine the contribution of S2-specific antibodies on protection against PEDV.",

As shown in Fig. 3 , most S-specific mAbs produced here (exception SD33-1) were capable of completely blocking PEDV infectivity (titers of 1:40 to 1:640), with a few of these mAbs (SD137-90, SD138-108 and SD142-2) presenting markedly higher neutralizing activity (titers up to 1:640) ( Table 2 ). Considering the highly stringent endpoint criteria used in the in vitro neutralization assays (90% reduction in fluorescent focus-forming units or 80% reduction in plaque forming-units), and the fact that these are monospecific antibodies these titers represent potent neutralizing activities. It is important to note, that while mAbs SD137-90, SD138-108 and SD142-2 specifically recognized two overlapping epitopes located in the amino-terminus of the S2 subunit (aa 744-759 and 747-774), they did not react against epitope 756-771, which is also contained within the neutralizing epitope aa 747-774 in S2. Together these results indicate that these mAbs either recognize epitope 744-759 or, perhaps, a smaller epitope within this region. These observations suggest that epitope 744-759 might represent a core immunodominant neutralizing epitope of PEDV S. However, the possibility that these results reflect a higher avidity and/or affinity of [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] these specific mAbs for their target epitope cannot be formally excluded. At least two genetically distinct strains of PEDV (prototype and S-INDEL variant strains) have been described in the US and in other parts of the world Oka et al., 2014) . The S-INDEL variant strains contain aa insertions, deletions and/or substitutions mainly in the N-terminus of the S1 protein subunit (first 350 aa). Although a recent study has shown that there is significant serological and neutralizing cross-reactivity between two representative strains obtained in the US (Chen et al., 2016), significant antigenic differences Fig. 4 . Neutralizing activity of PEDV S-specific mAbs. The neutralizing activity of each PEDV-S mAb was determined by fluorescent focus neutralization assay (FFN; 90% reduction cutoff) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT, 80% reduction cutoff). Swine convalescent serum (\u03b1-PEDV) was used as positive control. Each mAb was tested in three independent experiments. F.A. Okda et al. Virology 509 (2017) [185] [186] [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] have been demonstrated between PEDV strains by using mAbs against the S1 protein subunit (Li et al., 2017) . Here we showed that ten of eleven mAbs recognized both prototype (CO13) and S-INDEL F.A. Okda et al. Virology 509 (2017) 185-194 lation between the levels of neutralizing antibodies in serum, colostrum and milk of naturally infected sows with the levels of S1-and S2specific antibodies in these samples . Given that most neutralizing mAbs developed here are specific for epitopes located within the S1-S2 junction region, we performed endpoint ELISA titrations with these mAbs using the recombinant S1-S2 protein (aa 630-800) and assessed the correlation between ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers. Notably, a strong positive correlation between the ELISA titers and FFN titers was observed for all mAbs developed here. Similarly, neutralizing antibody titers detected on a convalescent swine serum sample used as positive control also matched the endpoint titers detected in the S1-S2 ELISA. These observations indicate the importance of the S protein as the major target of neutralizing antibody responses against PEDV, and highlight the S1-S2 junction as an immunodominant region with strong neutralizing activity within the S protein.",

Plaque counts for each antibody were used to calculate percent reduction in plaques as follows: % reduction = 100 \u00d7 [1 \u2212 (average number of plaques for each dilution/average number of plaques in the virus control well). An 80% reduction in the number of plaques was used as a cutoff to determine neutralizing antibody titers. Each mAb was tested in duplicate and four control wells used on each assay, including, a virus control (no antibody) and a negative control (MEM only). Additionally, convalescence PEDV polyclonal serum and unrelated mAbs controls (anti-PRRS, and anti-PEDV N protein antibody), were used on every PRN assay.",

Unbound antibodies were washed with PBS-T (three times) followed by incubation with streptavidin-HRP specific IgG and IgM conjugate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to each MAb isotype. Reactions were developed with 3,3\u2032,5\u20325\u2032tetramethylbenzidine substrate (TMB) (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MA) and OD values determined at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). OD values for each test and control samples were normalized to the OD value of uncoated wells and results expressed as OD values. An internal cutoff value of 0.16 for WV and recombinant protein ELISAs was calculated using MedCalc version 11.1.1.0 (MedCalc software, Mariakerke, Belgium). Each antibody dilution (tested in triplicate) was treated as a sample resulting in a total of 225 positive and 75 negative samples used in the cutoff calculation.
