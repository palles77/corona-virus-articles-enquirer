Repellents with DEET should not be used on infants less than 2 months and after 2 months, only repellents with 30% or less DEET should be used. Malaria prophylaxis is also recommended for children in malaria endemic areas. Dosing will need to be adjusted based on weight. Doxycycline should not be given to children less than 8 years old because of the risk of teeth staining, and atovaquone-proguanil should not be used in children weighing less than 5 kg. Rabies is more common in children owing to less fear in approaching animals. If there is exposure to any animal bite, seek medical care immediately. Consider rabies vaccine if planning to spend more than 3 months in endemic area.",

If stool is tested for ova and parasites, 3 or more stool specimens should be collected to increase sensitivity. 7 Some organisms, such as Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora, require specific testing. Testing for Clostridium difficile should be performed if the traveler recently used antibiotics or malaria chemoprophylaxis. A minority of travelers have persistent diarrhea lasting more than 2 weeks, which can be from (1) persistent infection or an untreated coinfection, (2) postinfectious processes like postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome, which can be diagnosed using the Rome criteria, or (3) unmasking of a previously undiagnosed gastrointestinal disease. 7",
