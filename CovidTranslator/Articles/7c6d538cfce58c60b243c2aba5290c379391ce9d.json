On human cells both viruses utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as entry receptor. Blocking the viral entry is specific as alpha virus Sindbis shows no reduction in infectivity. Peptide 438 YKYRYL 443 is part of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV. Peptide libraries were screened by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to identify RBD binding epitopes. 438 YKYRYL 443 carries the dominant binding epitope and binds to ACE2 with K D = 46 lM. The binding mode was further characterized by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamic simulations. Based on this information the peptide can be used as lead structure to design potential entry inhibitors against SARS-CoV and related viruses.",

            "text": "The SARS-associated corona virus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which emerged as an alerting epidemic in winter of 2002-2003 resulting in over 8000 infected cases with approximately 10% deaths Ksiazek et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003; WHO, 2004) . SARS-CoV infects human host cells by an initial interaction of its spike glycoprotein (S) and the receptor on human cells, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Dimitrov, 2003; Holmes, 2003; Li et al., 2003) . Functional characterization of the S protein suggests that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is located between amino acid residues 303 and 537 (Xiao et al., 2003) . Flow cytometry indicated that amino acids 270-510 are the minimal receptor binding region of the S glycoprotein (Babcock et al., 2004) . Further studies located the RBD from residues 318 to 510. The RBD fused to the Fc region of human IgG 1 (RBD-Fc) binds ACE2 with higher affinity (K D $ 10 nM) than does the full length S1-Ig chimera (Li et al., 2005b; Wong et al., 2004) . The crystal structure of residues 306-527 of the S1 in complex with the receptor ACE2 reveals that a loop within the RBD (residues 424-494) makes all the contacts to ACE2 and is referred to as the receptor-binding motif (RBM). Six tyrosine residues are involved in direct binding to the receptor (Li et al., 2005a) . Studying the virus adaptation to humans the spike protein also seems to play a major role in the species specificity of coronavirus infection. Especially, the introduction of a threonine residue at position 487 and an asparagine instead of a charged lysine residue at position 479 of the spike protein seem to be responsible for its high affinity to human ACE2 (Holmes, 2005; Li et al., 2005b; Qu et al., 2005) . Yi et al. demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution (R441A) in a full-length spike protein DNA vaccine failed to induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and that the same mutation yielded pseudoviruses that were unable to enter the human cells (Yi et al., 2005) . Furthermore, the RBD-Fc bearing the same R441A mutation shows no affinity to ACE2 and is not capable of blocking S protein-mediated pseudovirus entry (He et al., 2006) . The interaction of SARS-CoV with its receptor ACE2 is an attractive drug target as epitopes of the RBD on the spike protein may serve as leads for the design of effective entry inhibitors (Du et al., 2009) . Another drug target is the fusion process of the spike protein with the host cell membrane that is characterized by the presence of two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2, which are postulated to form a fusion-active conformation similar to those of other typical viral fusion proteins (Sainz et al., 2006; van der Hoek et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2004) .

A MOS X496 synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech) and a Liberty microwave synthesizer (CEM) were used for peptide syntheses starting with 20 lmol amino groups each. After each coupling step the growing peptide was capped with an acetyl residue by 10% acetic anhydride in DMF. Cysteine residues were substituted by serines to avoid dimerization. Using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), triisopropylsilan and H 2 O (95:5:2, v/v), peptides were cleaved off the resin leaving an amide at the C-terminus. The cocktail was applied twice for 90 and 60 min, respectively. Preparative RP-HPLC was carried out on a BIOCAD 700E instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) using a H 2 O/acetonitrile gradient (0.1% TFA) on a VP250/21 Nucleodur C18 Pyramid 5 l column (Macherey & Nagel). Peptides were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a BIFLEX III instrument (Bruker Daltonics) in reflector mode using 2,5dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) or a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CCA) as a matrix. Peptide RBD-11b (YKYRYL, Y438-L443) and related peptides were further characterized by 1D-and 2D-NMR spectroscopy (not shown).",

The receptor protein ACE2 was immobilized on the sensor chip and the peptides were passed over the sensor surface. The affinity of the interaction is determined from the level of binding at equilibrium as a function of sample concentration and can also be determined from analysis of the binding kinetics. SPR screening of the sixteen 12mer RBD peptides resulted in positive responses of three peptides, i.e. RBD-11 (Y438-R449 -YKYRYLRHGKLR), RBD-14 (S474-T485 -SYWPLNDYGFYT) and RBD-15 (T486-V497 -TTGIGYQPYRVV), respectively. All other RBD peptides showed no or insignificantly small response signals and were thus not interacting with ACE2. To analyze whether the interaction of the peptides RBD-11, RBD-14 and RBD-15 is based on a specific binding event, the SPR sensorgrams of each compound were recorded at several different concentrations. The signal at equilibrium measured in response units [RU] obtained from the sensorgrams was plotted against the concentration of ligand passed over the sensor surface (cf. Fig 1) . Assuming a one site binding model the specific saturable binding affinity of the ligand peptides is calculated to K D = 85 \u00b1 14 lM for RBD-11, K D = 450 \u00b1 36 lM for RBD-14 and K D = 672 \u00b1 168 lM for RBD-15. The SPR sensorgrams were also used to determine kinetic parameters of binding, the association rate constant k on [s \u00c01 M \u00c01 ] and the dissociation rate constant k off [s \u00c01 ]. RBD-11 shows a fivefold higher association rate constant k on = 1.8 \u00c2 10 3 s \u00c01 M \u00c01 compared to RBD-14 and RBD-15 with k on = 3.7 \u00c2 10 2 s \u00c01 M \u00c01 and 3.2 \u00c2 10 2 s \u00c01 M \u00c01 , respectively. The dissociation rate of all three peptides is comparable with k off = 0.12 s \u00c01 (RBD-11), 0.16 s \u00c01 (RBD-14) and 0.15 s \u00c01 (RBD-15), respectively. The dissociation constant K D = k off /k on resulting from analysis of the kinetic data of the peptides are K D = 67 lM (RBD-11), 430 lM (RBD-14) and 450 lM (RBD-15) in excellent agreement with the dissociation constants obtained from thermodynamic data analysis. The on-rates suggest that the bioactive conformation of peptide RBD-11 is more similar to its solution conformation than for RBD-14 and RBD-15. Peptides RBD-11, RBD-14 and RBD-15 contain 60% of the residues, namely Y440, Y442, Y475, N479, Y484, T486, T487, G488 and Y491 that were identified by X-ray crystal structure analysis to be in contact with ACE2 (Li et al., 2005a) .

Fig. 3 shows the 1 H STD NMR spectrum of RBD-11b (YKYRYL) and receptor ACE2 at a 72 fold excess of the ligand over the protein. Dependence of the STD amplification factor on the concentration of RBD-11b yields the K D value. A one site binding model fits the experimental data well and gives K D values in the low micromolar range: Hd,d 0 of the Tyr442 results in K D = 60 \u00b1 25 lM. The binding epitope was determined from STD spectra at a 144 fold excess of the ligand. It shows that all tyrosine residues have a close contact to ACE2. Furthermore, the Ha atom of Arg441 also has a close proximity to the receptor surface. The Ha atoms of Tyr440 and Leu443 interact also strongly with the cellular receptor. The positively charged groups of lysine and arginine side chains also show moderately strong interactions with the surface. The C-terminal leucine seems to be involved in a hydrophobic contact via its side chain. The highest level of saturation of 4.1% STD (absolute) is found for the He,e of Tyr440. The X-ray crystal structure analysis of the complex of RBD (residues 318-510) with ACE2 shows only contacts of Tyr440 and Tyr442 of the RBD with ACE2 (Li et al., 2005a) . However, in the isolated hexapeptide YKYRYL, Tyr438 is also binding to ACE2. According to mutation studies Arg441 of SARS-CoV spike protein is important for binding affinity (He et al., 2006) . This fact is confirmed by STD NMR analysis. The side chain protons Hd,d of Arg441 exhibit 0.7% absolute STD, which suggests an ionic interaction of the guanidinium group with the receptor molecule. The X-ray structure of the complex revealed no direct contact between Arg441 of RBD and ACE2. Thus in the free form the hexapeptide adopts a different binding mode and conformation compared to the case when integrated into the RBD. Lys439 also makes a contact via its positively charged group evidenced by the STD effect on the He,e protons that receive a saturation of 0.6%. Protons of Leu443 methyl groups show a STD effect of 0.6% and 0.9% STD, respectively, indicating a contact of the methyl groups to the receptor.",

VeroE6 cells were infected with the SARS-CoV isolate Frankfurt. As described previously, growth of the virus in Vero cells is not associated with a cytopathic effect (Vassilatis et al., 2003) . Cells were infected with a virus titer of 0.01 MOI. The inoculum was removed after 1 h and replaced with fresh medium complemented with different concentrations of peptide RBD-11b in a one-time dose. Two days post infection virus RNA concentration in the supernatant was measured by real-time PCR (cf. Fig. 4 ). There was no evidence for toxicity of the compound in the concentration range tested with MTT cell proliferation assay on subconfluent cells. After two days a onetime dose of the peptide RBD-11b (YKYRYL, 10.5 mM) reduced the virus RNA level compared to the untreated control by a factor of 10. Further, the inhibition of virus proliferation by the peptide is concentration dependent. After two days, relative to an untreated control virus RNA is reduced by a factor of 600 at a 14 mM concentration of the peptide. The final amount of virus RNA is in fact lower than the initially added amount. These data suggest that the hexapeptide blocks indeed the binding site necessary for the initial viral attachment to the human receptor ACE2 and effectively inhibits viral entry into Vero cells. Thus, the virus is not capable to replicate and viral particles are exposed to the degradation process. These results are in good agreement with the occupation of the receptor's binding site given the peptide's dissociation constant of K D = 46 lM. At peptide concentrations of 7 mM the occupation of binding sites is 99.3%, at 10.5 mM it is 99.6% and at 14 mM 99.7%, respectively.",

The protein peptide complex was placed in a water box with 18,145 water molecules and a sodium chloride concentration of 0.2 mol/L. The peptide shows high dynamics during the MD but stays always in contact with the receptor surface. Fig. 6 shows the starting and the final conformation of the complex. The side chains of amino acids Tyr440 and Tyr442 interact with ACE2 in the crystal structure. At the end of the MD simulation Lys439, Tyr440 and Arg441 show interactions with the receptor. The binding mode of hexapeptide RBD-11b to ACE2 differs from the binding mode of the hexapeptide as part of the full length S protein. The positively charged residue of Lys439 forms ionic interactions with the carboxyl group of Glu23 of ACE2.

It is a respiratory disease with about 10% mortality that is caused by a variant of the common coronaviruses (SARS-CoV). Rigid political measures helped to contain the epidemic within a short period of time. So far no specific treatment against SARS is available. In search for molecules that can specifically block the attachment of the virus to the human cell, we analyzed binding modes of viral peptides to the human receptor. We identified and characterized the focal point of the viral protein that is used by the virus for its attachment to the human cell. We found a hexapeptide in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS-CoV that carries a significant portion of the binding affinity of the virus to the human cell. The S protein mediates the attachment of the virus to its functional receptor ACE2. The attachment of the virus to ACE2 does not interfere with the natural function of the receptor. Therefore, it is easy to block the attachment site of the virus in the upper respiratory tract as a preventive measure against SARS. We could clearly demonstrate that hexapeptide Tyr-Lys-Tyr-Arg-Tyr-Leu reduces viral infection of epithelial cells, as found in the upper respiratory tract, by a factor of 600. This peptide was shown to be specific against coronaviruses that attach to the ACE2 receptor. Its mode of action is specific as it does not interfere with other infections by viruses that utilize different receptors, like alpha virus Sindbis. Combination of several biophysical methods, e.g. SPR, STD NMR and molecular dynamics simulations, were used to characterize the specific binding mode of the inhibitory peptide. Although there is currently no SARS outbreak the need of an antiviral drug, e.g. based on the hexapeptide, is still present. A viral reservoir is present in wild animals like bats and civet cats and a new epidemic is likely someday.",

The peptides RBD-11, RBD-14 and RBD-15 bind to ACE2 with dissociation constants K D = 85 \u00b1 14 lM for RBD-11, K D = 450 \u00b1 36 lM for RBD-14 and K D = 672 \u00b1 168 lM for RBD-15.
