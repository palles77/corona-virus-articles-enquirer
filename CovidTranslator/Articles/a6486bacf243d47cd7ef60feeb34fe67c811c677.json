Numerous plant extracts have been utilized in traditional medicine since centuries, for raw and processed food preservation, in pharmaceuticals, in alternative medicine and natural therapies, and as potential sources of new drugs [4 ,8] . The rise in demand for plant-derived antimicrobials has been attributed to several reasons including decreased microbial susceptibility (increased resistance) to traditionally-used antibiotics, increased consumer demand for plant-derived antimicrobials, potentially-decreased cost, ease of availability in developing countries, and sustainability. This trend is also suggested to be promoted by the World Health Day 2011 theme of 'Antimicrobial resistance: no action today, no cure tomorrow' [6 ] . However, among the estimated 250,000-500,000 plant species present on earth, only a small fraction are reportedly screened for com-pounds with antimicrobial activity and only 1-10% of plants are reported to be used as food by animals and humans [4 ,6 ] .",

Human enteric viruses of public health concern include human noroviruses (HNoVs), hepatitis A virus (HAV), rotaviruses, sapoviruses, Aichi virus, adenoviruses, hepatitis E virus, astroviruses, and various human enteroviruses [8] . It has been recognized worldwide that HNoVs are the leading cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis, being responsible for an estimated 5.5 million foodborne illnesses, 27% hospitalizations, and 11% of food-related deaths in the United States, annually [9 ] . When taking into account all modes of transmission, HNoVs cause an average of 570-800 deaths, including 400,000 Emergency Department visits, and 19-21 million total illnesses annually in the United States alone [10 ] . This results in medically associated financial losses as well as loss in time at work.",

As currently there are no vaccines available to prevent HNoV-related illness, adequate control measures are needed, to prevent contamination, inactivate the viruses, and/or treat diseases. Much research continues toward investigating the role of fruit-derived natural phenolics and other plant extracts against human enteric viruses.

Cranberry proanthocyanidins (CPAC) consist primarily of epicatechin tetramers and pentamers with at least one A-type linkage [20] . The proanthocyanidin content of raw cranberries can average 410 mg/100 g fresh fruit weight [3] . In addition, 100% cranberry juice contains tannins at concentrations as high as 0.13 g/L [14] .

These researchers also attempted to understand the mechanism of action of CPAC, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and showed slight structural changes for FCV-F9 treated with CJ and CPAC. To understand effects of CJ and CPAC on virus binding to host cells, cell monolayers treated for 1 h with CJ (pH 7) or 0.3 mg/ml CPAC, followed by FCV-F9 or MNV-1 infection, were not reported to show any reduction in FCV-F9 titers, while MNV-1 titers were reported to be reduced by 0.51 and 0.91 log PFU/ml with 50% CJ and 0.3 mg/ml CPAC, respectively [16] . When these researchers first infected CRFK and RAW cells with FCV-F9 and MNV-1 to determine effects on replication, followed by treatment with CJ at 50% and 0.3 mg/ml CPAC for 1 h, FCV-F9 titers were reduced by 0.43 and 0.44 log PFU/ml, respectively, while MNV-1 titers were reduced by 0.80 and 0.42 log PFU/ml, respectively. Thus, they concluded that CJ and CPAC showed some modest effects on both MNV-1 adsorption and replication. These data along with the infectivity data, confirmed that CJ and CPAC show some antiviral effects against the tested HNoV surrogates.",

However, concentrations lower than 10% produced no significant reduction. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed that CJ-treated phage T4 was unable to attach to bacterial host cells. CJ at 20% concentration was also shown to completely inhibit hemagglutination of simian rotavirus [17] . These researchers proposed that CJ led to alterations in glycoprotein moieties, resulting in failure of virus binding to the host-cell receptors. They also showed that CJ and CPAC had antiviral activity against waterborne rotavirus SA-11 and bovine reovirus [17] . Rotavirus SA-11 treated with cranberry extracts had single-shelled or anomalous virus-like particles, while the control samples contained the typical double-shelled, icosahedral 'wheel-like' particles by TEM. Additionally, they reported that pretreatment of MA-104 host cell monolayers with a concentration of 5% NC-90 (NutriCran-90 TM ) and NC-100 (NutriCran-100 TM ) extracts (cranberry cocktail) reduced reovirus infectivity titers to 50% of control, while commercial CJ cocktail caused only 10% reduction [17] .

They also showed that pretreatment of host cell monolayers with PJ or PP for 45 min, followed by FCV-F9 or MNV-1 infection, resulted in 1.05 and 0.40 log PFU/ml reduction of FCV-F9 with 20% PJ and 0.4 mg/ml PP, respectively, and 0.55 and 0.29 log PFU/ml reduction of MNV-1 with 30% PJ and 0.8 mg/ml PP, respectively. These slightly higher reductions with pretreatment of cells suggested that PJ bioactives and PP may block viral binding to host-cells to some degree. Using ELISA, cranberry and pomegranate juices were shown to reduce the specific binding ability of HNoV P particles of GII.4 [27] . This is in agreement with earlier reported work using cranberry and pomegranate juices and their extracts against HNoV surrogates [25, 26] . Konowalchuk and Speirs (1978) found <1% survival of 3 log PFU poliovirus/0.05 ml after storage at 4 8C for 24 h in PJ, though the mechanism of action was not reported [18] . Punicalagin was shown to inhibit human enterovirus Table 1 Brief summary of fruit juices and/or their associated polyphenol extracts against human enteric viruses and viral surrogates. [29] . These researchers also confirmed that commercially available, highly purified tannic acid was a strong inhibitor of HNoV P protein binding to both A and B saliva (IC 50 0.1 mM), suggesting that tannic acid is a promising antiviral against HNoVs [29] .",

It was also shown that FCV-F9 at high titers was decreased by 3.17 and 0.72 log PFU/ml with myricetin and L-epicatechin at 1 mM, respectively and by 1.73 log PFU/ml with 0.5 mM myricetin. However, MNV-1 was not reported to be reduced by these flavonoids at the tested concentrations. These results suggest that the antiviral effects of the tested flavonoids were dependent on the flavonoid concentration, virus type, and virus titer [40] . However, since these phytochemicals at the concentrations studied did not show any significant effect on MNV-1, caution is advised when extrapolating these data for HNoV inactivation.",

Other tannins derived from green tea, acacia and gallnuts were also reported to be effective against some of these viruses, while coffee extracts were not effective against any of the tested viruses. These investigators reported that protein aggregation played a role in decreasing viral infectivity [41] . Crude theaflavin extracts from U.S. black tea when tested against bovine coronavirus (ATCC P2 strain) were shown to have a mean effective concentration that inhibited 50% infection (EC 50 ) at 34.7 mg/ml (standard error 9 mg/ml) using tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays. For bovine rotavirus strain, NCDV-Lincoln, the reported EC 50 values were 0.353 mg/ml against 200-400 immunofluorescent focus-forming units (IFFU) [2] .",
