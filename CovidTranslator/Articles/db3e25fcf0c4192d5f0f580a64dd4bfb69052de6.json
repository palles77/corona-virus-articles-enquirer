Despite those decimating effects on health and decades of intensive research, treatments remain largely supportive. The only commonly available vaccines are against influenza virus, and even these need improvement. The lung shares some features with other mucosal sites, but preservation of its especially delicate anatomical structures necessitates a fine balance of pro-and anti-inflammatory responses; well-timed, appropriately placed and tightly regulated T cell and B cell responses are essential for protection from infection and limitation of symptoms, whereas poorly regulated inflammation contributes to tissue damage and disease. Recent advances in understanding adaptive immunity should facilitate vaccine development and reduce the global effect of respiratory viruses.",

If these defenses are breached, epithelial cells have a central role in initiating the immune response by recognizing viral components via PRRs such as TLRs and intracellular sensors, including RIG-I-like receptors 31 . Ligation of these leads to a signaling cascade that results in the upregulation of type I and III interferons that trigger the inflammatory response, contribute to the differentiation of cells of the adaptive immune system and promote an antiviral state locally 32 .",

As understanding of the Figure 1 The roles of adaptive T cells and B cells in respiratory viral infection. During acute respiratory viral infection, humoral and cell-mediated immunity act at different points in time to limit disease. Mucosal IgA generated during previous encounter with virus can prevent or limit infection. IgG in the lungs can limit more severe disease. T cells are beneficial in terms of eliminating virus-infected cells; they coordinate a regulated immune response and, as T FH cells, promote high-affinity durable antibodies. Failure to control viral dissemination can lead to severe disease. T reg cells restrain effector responses through various mechanisms, including suppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-b) and possibly active killing via perforin and granzyme B (GzmB). An overexuberant or poorly regulated immune response can also lead to damaging immunopathology.",

Although correlation is not proof of causation, it is highly plausible that antibodies at appropriate sites have a direct role in protection against both infection and systemic dissemination. Antibodies can neutralize infectivity directly by binding to viral surface proteins that are essential for entry of the virus into host cells ( Figs. 1 and 2) . This property underlies the most commonly used serological measure of immunity to influenza virus: hemagglutination inhibition. This detects hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibody by its ability to block the HA receptor-binding site, which prevents the clumping together of red blood cells after exposure to influenza virus in vitro 40 . Functional neutralizing antibodies to respiratory viruses (including influenza virus and RSV) can be measured by plaque-reduction assays, although such methods require standardization [41] [42] [43] . In addition to neutralizing viruses, antibodies can also act through the ligation of Fc receptors to enable triggering of the complement cascade and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 44, 45 (Fig. 2) . The importance of these mechanisms is less well defined than is the importance of virus neutralization, but these mechanisms may be important adjuncts for viral clearance and can also be quantified. The different aspects of antibody-mediated effector function that these assays measure are therefore important considerations in determining correlates of protection.",

            "text": "T FH cells T FH cells were first described as a CD4 + T cell subset in the tonsils specialized to help the generation and maintenance of high-affinity B cells and antibody responses 58 . T FH cells express a characteristic set of markers, including the chemokine receptor CXCR5 (to allow homing to the GCs, where they chiefly reside), PD-1, ICOS, CD28, CD40L, SAP and their lineage-specifying transcription factor Bcl-6. Their localization in GCs allows close contact with proliferating B cells and follicular DCs. T FH cells can deliver signals to promote 'preferential' selection, with further differentiation allowing B cells to out-compete low-affinity suboptimal clones 74 . As well as participating in direct cell-to-cell signaling, T FH cells produce IL-21, which promotes isotype switching to IgA and enhances Bcl-6 expression in B cells, thus augmenting memory generation 75 . T FH cells are therefore essential for durable protective antibody responses and are potentially key to the efficient generation of vaccineinduced antiviral immunity. In some respiratory infections, such as infection with RSV, impairment of antigen presentation to T cells or inhibition of type I interferon signaling can have a role in modulating T FH cell responses 18 . Although there are as yet no data on T FH cells in human infection with RSV, it is possible that a defect in T FH cell help (such as impaired IL-21 signaling) might contribute to the poor longevity of RSV-specific antibody responses. The differentiation pathways of T FH cells are not fully understood. In common with GC B cells, T FH cells express Bcl-6, and expression of this factor in both cell types is required for the GC reaction to occur. Bcl-6 expression in T FH cells suppresses the expression of other lineagespecific transcription factors and removes the effect of microRNAs that suppress ICOS, PD-1 and CXCR5, thus promoting the T FH cell phenotype 76 . However, the key triggers for differentiation into the T FH cell phenotype remain controversial. CD4 + T cells exhibit a high degree of plasticity, and conversion between T FH cells and other subsets of helper T cells (including T H 1, T H 2 and T H 17 cells) has been described in various systems depending on the environmental context, cytokine milieu and infection type. In vitro, T FH cells can be induced to express type 1, 2 and 17 cytokines with the appropriate polarizing signals and, in some animal models, can also be shown to express these in vivo 77 . However, several studies suggest that the lineage 'decision' between T H 1 cells and T FH cells occurs early during the activation of naive CD4 + T cells and that the T FH cell phenotype is maintained stably into the memory phase 78 . This may be due to persistent antigen availability, with longer engagement of the T cell antigen receptor promoting the T FH cell fate over the T H 1 lineage fate 79 . Conversely, in a mouse model of infection with influenza virus, IL-2 has been shown to polarize CD4 + T cells to a T H 1 phenotype and away from the T FH cell phenotype, with defective GC B cell responses when systemic IL-2 is administered 80 .",

Short-lived plasmablasts are formed at this stage, while some B cells progress to participate in the germinal center (GC) reaction, where somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation occur, promoted by specialized CD4 + follicular helper T cells (T FH cells) that express the costimulatory receptor ICOS, the costimulatory molecule PD-1, IL-21 and other markers driven by the transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 (refs. 58-60). Following multiple rounds of selection, high-affinity antibody-secreting cells are generated, as are non-antibody-secreting memory B cells. The former are responsible for the abrupt increase in antibody titers that occurs relatively early during infection, but this population contracts following antigen clearance, leaving a small number of long-lived plasma cells 61 . These cells migrate to survival niches that include the bone marrow and respiratory mucosa, and they are responsible for the maintenance of long-term antibody titers 62 . TLR signaling is crucial in this process, with TLR9 and TLR10 on B cells potentially directly promoting immunoglobulin production 63 . Adjuvants can enhance antibody production via similar B cell-intrinsic mechanisms, with 'imprinting' of B cells leading to upregulation of the Bcl-6 homolog Zbtb20 and promoting the long-term survival of plasma cells 64 . The number and persistence of plasma cells are thus determined by a sequence of fate 'decisions' that depends on the integration of a variety of signals: the immediate 'choice' between the proliferation or death of perifollicular B cells in the first 3 days after antigen encounter; differentiation into shortlived extra-follicular plasma cells or participation in the GC reaction; positive selection of the affinity of the B cell receptor for viral antigen (rather than self antigen) for the generation of B cell clones of increasingly higher affinity; and the long-term survival versus death of the resultant antibody-secreting cells 65 .",

The secondary activation of memory B cells leads to early proliferation and the production of antibodies, whereas a subset of these cells go on to participate once again in the GC reaction for further affinity maturation and replenishment of the memory pool. The fate of these memory B cells is probably determined at an early stage, with markers (including CD80 and PD-L2) defining subsets that are to undergo early differentiation into plasmablasts or those that reenter the GC 66 . B cell memory is particularly important for responses to respiratory viruses, to which people are commonly exposed multiple times throughout their lives. Classically, recurrent encounter with viral antigens should lead to boosting of antibody titers that ultimately leads to complete protection. However, respiratory viruses have evolved diverse ways of evading host immunity. These strategies include the aforementioned mutation of genes encoding the surface antigenic determinants HA and NA of influenza virus, or the reassortment of gene segments that leads to wholesale replacement of these by variants from zoonotic strains to which human populations have no preexisting immunity 67 . Similarly, rhinoviruses have diversified into over 150 distinct serotypes against which cross-protection is weak or nonexistent 68 . In contrast, RSV is relatively well conserved, with only the attachment G glycoprotein displaying substantial antigenic diversity 69 . Despite the fact that the other major RSV surface antigen, F protein, is more highly conserved across RSV strains and F protein-specific antibodies are easily detected in all adults, recurrent infection with RSV occurs throughout life even in the absence of any immunological defect 70 . This might be explained by the expression of various proteins with immunomodulatory potential that can affect immunological memory, including the nonstructural proteins that interfere with type I and III interferons and a fractalkine-like motif in G protein 71, 72 . The reasons underlying the remarkably rapid decrease in protective immunity after infection with Following clearance of virus, the effector T cell populations contract, leaving long-lived memory T cells that, like memory B cells, are ready to combat secondary infection. Diversity of signal intensity, antigen availability, costimulatory signaling and the cytokine milieu leads to a heterogeneous population of memory T cells that can be categorized into functional subsets in both animal models and humans according to their expression of surface markers 100 . Until recently, two major subsets of memory T cells had been recognized: central memory T cells that express the lymph node-homing receptor CD62L and chemokine receptor CCR7, which allows them to circulate between blood and lymphoid tissues; and effector memory T cells that do not express those receptors and display heightened effector ability. Together, these populations have the ability to self-renew and, on reencountering their cognate antigen, proliferate rapidly while upregulating cytotoxic and other effector molecules.",

            "text": "The developmental pathway for lung T RM cells remains to be elucidated but seems to require a sequence of differentiation steps. In the draining lymph nodes, antigen presentation by CD103 + DCs predisposes CD8 + T cells to effector differentiation, with the ability to enter inflamed tissues via the expression of such receptors as CCR5 and downregulation of CD62L 107 . This contrasts with CD11b hi DCs, which 'preferentially' prime central memory T cell-like cells. In addition, effector T cells destined for the lungs can express a combination of chemokine receptors, including CXCR3 and CCR4 (refs. 108,109) . In the genital mucosa of mice, macrophages make the chemokines CCL5 and CXCL9, which attract and retain T RM cells 110 . Following the migration of T RM cells to sites of infection, the strength of signaling via the T cell antigen receptor and availability of additional signals via costimulatory receptors and cytokines (such as IL-12) drive differentiation toward a terminally differentiated short-lived effector state or (later in the course of infection) toward memory precursor cells 111 . Environmental cues probably govern commitment to the T RM cell phenotype; for example, CD103 is not expressed on herpes simplex virus-specific CD8 + T cells until they have been present in infected skin for a certain length of time 105 . Important among local signals is TGF-b, produced by regulatory T cells (T reg cells) and, to a lesser extent, activated CD4 + T cells in the respiratory epithelium. Upon recognition of antigen presented by DCs, CD4 + T cells secrete the 'latent' form of TGF-b1; this dimer of TGF-b1 and the latency-associated protein LAP interacts with integrin a V b 8 on DCs (or longevity and antibody persistence. Although studies investigating this in humans are limited, the potential translational effect of understanding the role of T FH cells is clear. Additionally, novel intracellular pathways are increasingly recognized as regulating the differentiation and function of T FH cells and therefore affecting B cell fate. For example, the microRNA cluster miR-17~92 is required for the differentiation of T FH cells and their migration into B cell follicles. Moreover, inactivation of miR-17~92 impairs the differentiation of T FH cells, the formation of GCs and the secretion of high-affinity antibodies, while T cell-specific transgenic expression of miR-17~92 enhances the generation of T FH cells and leads to fatal autoimmunity 84, 85 . This is an area of innovative research that shows particular promise for the improvement of vaccine design.",

Preexisting cross-reactive CD8 + T cells have also been shown to reduce the severity of symptoms during natural infection with influenza virus 93 . However, although live attenuated vaccines against influenza virus can induce CD8 + T cells directed against conserved epitopes, there is little clinical evidence that they confer substantial heterosubtypic protection 94 . Less is known about the role of T cells in protection against other respiratory viral diseases, but there are probably many commonalities 17, 95, 96 .

Following engagement of the T cell antigen receptor and appropriate costimulatory signals, T cells undergo a program of differentiation that rapidly commits them to the formation of an enlarged effector pool. CD8 + T cells acquire cytolytic activity and upregulate chemokine receptors that allow them to migrate to inflamed sites, where they detect virus-infected cells by binding to viral peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I. CD4 + T cells recognize viral peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex class II-bearing cells and differentiate, depending on the environmental context and strength of interaction, into a variety of helper T cell subsets that make specific cytokine combinations. Although in certain circumstances T H 2 cells and T H 17 cells can be induced (and potentially have a role in immunopathology), the protective response to respiratory viruses is typically dominated by IFN-g and is therefore biased toward a T H 1 response, which promotes cytolytic activity and viral clearance 18, 98, 99 . It is notable that the rapid proliferation of cells occurs in the local nodes rather than the lung itself, possibly to remove intense activation of the immune system from the delicate respiratory structures.",

For example, highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus, including recently emerged avian H5N1 strains that have crossed over into human populations, encode NS1 proteins that not only interfere with type I interferon activity but also are associated with increased release of inflammatory cytokines 122 . RSV also encodes an NS1 that suppresses type I interferons, and there is evidence that RSV G protein contains a region that has structural similarity to the chemokine fractalkine and thus promotes inappropriate inflammatory responses 72, 114, 123, 124 .",

Mucosal lymphocyte clusters (MLCs) are formed by T RM cells after viral infection and act as sensory cells as well as early effector cells during reencounter with pathogens. They are maintained by upregulation of IFITM3, which allows T RM cells to resist apoptosis during viral infection. Basal levels of IFN-g production by T RM cells activates tissue macrophages that release CCL5 and CXCL9, which keep the T RM cells in situ and prevent the migration of cells from the mucosal lymphocyte clusters into the lumen of the airway. 'Polyfunctional' production of IL-2 by T RM cells activates granzyme B production in natural killer (NK) cells and lymphocytes, whereas tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) activates DCs that carry antigen to regional nodes, thereby initiating the activation of T cells.

They also have a role in controlling vaccine-enhanced disease following vaccination with FI-RSV, for which transfer of conventional CD4 + T cells augments disease, whereas recruitment of T reg cells to the lungs ameliorates it 130 .

Although inactivated vaccines (IIV) and live attenuated vaccines (LAIV) against influenza virus are well established in most vaccination programs, they remain suboptimal in terms of both immunogenicity in many populations and the requirement for regular re-vaccination to overcome variation in influenza virus strains. Both IIV and LAIV must be reformulated each year, and unexpectedly poor matching of vaccine with circulating strains of influenza virus can reduce efficacy to less than 50% even in those with healthy mature immune systems 136 . While LAIV is delivered intranasally and has been shown to induce a mucosal immune response more akin to natural infection, there is no demonstrated effect of LAIV on heterosubtypic immunity. Furthermore, LAIV is generally ineffective in older adults in whom preexisting immunity blocks local infection and the vaccine-induced immune response 137 . For RSV, vaccine development has been slowed by concerns about vaccine-enhanced immunopathology and inadequately defined correlates of protection, as well as the specific difficulties of inducing appropriate immune responses in infants. Candidate vaccines for other respiratory viruses, including parainfluenza virus, have been held back for both scientific reasons and economic reasons 138 . Therefore, a substantial clinical need remains for the development of vaccines, antiviral agents and immunomodulatory therapeutics based on increased understanding of immune and pathological responses of the respiratory tract.",

Following antigen recognition, B cells differentiate with the help of cognate CD4 + T FH cells to form antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells.Class switching to IgG and IgA is followed by the secretion of large amounts of high-affinity antibody that can directly neutralize virus, block entry of the virus into the cell, fix complement, promote phagocytosis and allow antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Once antigen is cleared, a subset of plasma cells differentiate into a long-lived phenotype and migrate to survival niches in the respiratory tract and bone marrow.
