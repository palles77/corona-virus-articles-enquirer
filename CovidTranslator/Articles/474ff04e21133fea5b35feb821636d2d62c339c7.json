            "text": "The pleural space is a potential space formed by the parietal and visceral pleura. It normally contains a minimal amount (few milliliters) of serous fluid to facilitate motion of the lungs in relation to the thoracic cavity and to each other. 1 The pleura is a thin epithelium formed of mesothelial cells overlying a thin basal membrane. The pleurae contain a superficial network of lymphatic ducts, blood vessels, and rare nerves. 2 The partition between the right and left hemithoraces is incomplete in small animals, but unilateral or unevenly distributed disease is common. 3 Physiologic fluid flux in the pleural space is governed by Starling's law (Box 30-1). Hydrostatic pressure favors fluid accumulation within the pleural cavity (where pressure is subatmospheric), and the parietal pleurae (systemic circulation) has greater filtration capacity than the visceral pleura (pulmonary circulation). However, oncotic pressure favors reabsorption of fluid from both pleurae because the colloid osmotic pressure of the pleural space is 3.2 cm H 2 O in dogs (compared with 24.5 to 27 cm H 2 O in the vascular space). The visceral pleura assumes a larger role in determining the net pressure and favors reabsorption of fluid from the pleural space, where a greater vascular supply and lower hydrostatic pressure exist. Pleural lymphatic vessels are also an important component of fluid and blood reabsorption from the thorax. 3 There is an average pleural pressure of \u00c05 cm H 2 O, representing the difference between the lung recoil and the thoracic cavity expanding forces at rest. 4 Air, fluid, or soft tissue within the pleural space can cause the lungs to collapse and the chest wall to spring out by increasing the subatmospheric pressure within the thorax. 5 Pleural pathologic conditions such as these subsequently lead to a decrease in tidal volume, total vital capacity, and functional residual capacity. 6 The resulting atelectasis can lead to both hypoxemia and hypoventilation.

Repeat radiographs after thoracentesis can be of diagnostic utility but were found to rarely be beneficial in providing additional diagnostic information in one human study. 7 Routine radiographs after thoracentesis are considered unnecessary for stable patients in the absence of suspicion, clinical indication, or risk factors for complications (mostly pneumothorax) 7,8 (Figure 30-1). Because the shape of the canine and feline chest is much different from that of humans, it is possible that dorsoventral radiographs in animals with pleural effusion (following thoracentesis) may still have improved diagnostic utility for evaluating the dorsal lung fields. Ultrasonographic examination is very helpful for rapid identification of pleural fluid in the emergency setting. In human medicine, indications for use of ultrasonographically guided thoracentesis include a smallvolume effusion, inability to properly position the patient, failure of fluid to layer out on radiographs, and coagulopathy. 9 \"In veterinary medicine, ultrasound guidance is used routinely to confirm the ideal point of needle insertion for thoracentesis, mostly in patients with a small volume of effusion, fluid pockets or those at increased risk for complications.\"",

Its indications include (1) the presence of any undiagnosed pleural effusion and (2) therapeutic thoracentesis to relieve respiratory signs caused by large amounts of air or fluid. However, if the etiology of the effusion is known and the patient is not dyspneic, the procedure may be delayed and the clinical signs followed. 14 Fluid analysis has great diagnostic utility in patients with pleural effusion of an undetermined etiology. 14,15",

Abdominal and pericardial effusion can be concomitant. The effusive form is a more acute disease process but may be present terminally in noneffusive FIP. 17 The effusive form results from either a greater viral load causing a larger quantity of circulating immune complexes or an ineffective cell-mediated immune response. 17,18 Deposition of infected macrophages and immune complexes on the endothelium result in complement-mediated, severe pyogranulomatous vasculitis. 18 FIP is most often found in young, purebred, intact males. 19 Clinical signs will vary depending on the form and organ systems affected. Pleural or peritoneal fluid typically will be viscous, straw-colored, and have a high protein concentration (>3.5 g/dl) with a relatively low nucleated cell count (<5000 cells/ml). 17 Nondegenerate neutrophils predominate in the fluid, with or without macrophages and lymphocytes. 17 Immunofluorescent staining of intracellular FCoV antigen has high specificity, and anti-FCoV antibody testing has both high positive and negative predictive values. 20 The highest serum antibody titer (1:1600) is an excellent predictor of disease, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on the effusion has shown promising results although false results are possible. 20 Histopathology remains the gold standard for diagnosing this disease. 18",

Bacterial infection within a feline thorax is most often the result of bite wounds in young cats from multicat households. 22 Migrating inhaled foreign bodies, and traumatic thoracic penetration are more frequent in dogs. 23,24 Young adult hunting or working breeds are overrepresented. 25 Other bacterial sources reported include pneumonia, pleuropneumonia, lung abscess, aberrant migration of Cuterebra larvae or grass awns, hematogenous or lymphatic dissemination, esophageal or tracheal perforations, lung parasites, diskospondylitis, neoplasia with abscess formation, and iatrogenic causes. 22-24 Septic suppurative effusion typically is diagnosed when intracellular organisms are present on cytologic examination and the presence of intracellular organisms. Culture and sensitivity testing should be performed on the fluid and antibiotic therapy initiated. Ancillary tests such as glucose and lactate levels and pH may also be helpful to diagnose the presence of sepsis. 25,28 Anaerobic bacteria are found most commonly, 25,26 and infections with multiple organisms are highly prevalent. 22, 25 In cats, nonenteric bacteria are most common and Pasteurella spp is most frequently isolated. 22, 26 In dogs, Escherichia coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae are isolated most often. 26, 27 Hospitalization for appropriate supportive care and intravenous antibiotics is indicated. Pending culture and sensitivity results, broad spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy, such as enrofloxacin for gram-negative bacteria and ampicillin with sulbactam or ticarcillin with clavulanate for grampositive and anaerobic infections, 29 should be instituted as soon as possible. However, an increasing resistance of E. coli to enrofloxacin has been documented, and amikacin and ceftizoxime have shown to have better efficacy against this organism. 26 Clindamycin is also effective against many of the offending organisms in cats. Medical management with thoracostomy tubes (bilateral in most cases) is recommended, and sterile lavage with physiologic saline (10 to 20 ml/kg q6-12h daily) may be used initially if the effusion is thick and flocculent (see Chapter 32, Thoracostomy Tube Placement and Drainage). Absorbed lavage solution by the inflamed pleura can lead to fluid overload, so close monitoring of fluid \"ins and outs\" is recommended. Intermittent thoracentesis is not a recommended means of drainage and is associated with increased mortality. 17 Tubes will often be necessary for 4 to 6 days, 22, 25, 27 and removal is based on daily fluid reevaluation and the quantity of fluid produced (<2.2 ml/kg per tube q24h, although this can vary depending on the severity of pleuritis). 30 Thoracic radiographs or ultrasonographic examination should be used to monitor the efficacy of drainage. A thoracotomy should be performed if pocketed fluid is persistently not drained by the thoracostomy tubes; if lung or pleural abscess, foreign body, or neoplasia is suspected; or if medical management is failing.",

Small lymphocytes usually predominate; however, nondegenerate neutrophils may become predominant after repeated thoracocenteses or with chronic disease. 16 The triglyceride concentration within the effusion is higher than the concentration in the serum, while the cholesterol level is equal to or lower than that of the serum. Causes of chylothorax include heart disease (cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, pericardial disease), thoracic duct obstruction (intraluminal neoplasia or granuloma or extraluminal), traumatic rupture of the thoracic duct, cranial mediastinal mass (thymoma, lymphosarcoma, aortic body tumor), lung lobe torsion, diaphragmatic or peritoneopericardial hernia, post-pacemaker implantation in cats, heartworm disease, congenital malformations, cranial vena caval thromboembolism, ligation of the left brachiocephalic vein, and idiopathic contributors. 31, 32 Idiopathic chylous effusion is diagnosed by exclusion in most animals with true chylothorax. 33 Medical management consists of intermittent thoracentesis, a reduced-fat diet, and rutin (a benzopyrone). Rutin is a nutraceutical that stimulates macrophage breakdown of protein in lymph, accelerating its reabsorption. 31,34 Thoracostomy tubes are indicated only in animals with a traumatic chylothorax, if thoracentesis is required several times weekly, or following surgery. 6 Surgical intervention is recommended if the medical management is unsuccessful at providing good quality of life to the animal. Multiple interventions have been described, however a recent study has shown improved success rates with a combination of thoracic duct ligation and subtotal pericardectomy (100% of dogs and 80% of cats had resolution of pleural fluid accumulation for at least 60 days following the procedure). 33 Other surgical interventions reported include omentalization, passive pleuroperitoneal shunt, active pleuroperitoneal or pleurovenous shunt, and pleurodesis, but these procedures have shown a worse outcome. 31,33 Thoracoscopic ligation of the thoracic duct has been described in an experimental study. 35 Complications of chylous effusion and its drainage include weight loss, electrolyte abnormalities (pseudoaddisonian), lymphopenia, hypoproteinemia, dehydration, and fibrosing pleuritis. 31 Rarely, spontaneous resolution of idiopathic effusion occurs. This is expected in most animals suffering from traumatic thoracic duct rupture.",

A disorder of fibrin turnover is thought to lead to deposition of the intrapleural fibrin matrix. 39 Radiographs will show rounded, retracted lung lobe(s) that will not expand following thoracentesis. Pulmonary edema and interstitial fibrosis may contribute to dyspnea. 40 Decortication is the only successful therapy in humans and should be considered early for better outcome, while pulmonary changes are minimal.
