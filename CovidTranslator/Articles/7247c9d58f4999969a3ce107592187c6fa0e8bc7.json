            "text": "Acute sinusitis is a common condition seen by general practitioners worldwide. It is estimated that the incidence of sinusitis is 35 million people each year in the United States, contributing to between 15 and 40 cases per 1 000 patients. 1 Episodes of acute sinusitis are more prevalent in adults and are the second leading cause of infectious disease encountered in clinical practice. 2 Women have a greater incidence of the infection than men and have a higher probability of seeking care. 3, 4 Acute sinusitis is an infection and inflammatory process affecting the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses. Common symptoms include facial pain, rhinorrhea, pressure or fullness in the sinuses, and nasal obstruction that can last up to 4 weeks. 5 Acute sinusitis is diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, most importantly the presence of purulent nasal discharge. 5 It is commonly caused by a virus and is a self-limiting condition and in most cases can be treated symptomatically. The viruses that are transmitted inducing acute sinusitis are the same as those associated with the common cold. 6 These viruses are the rhinovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus. However, not all cases of acute sinusitis are initiated by a virus. The bacterium Haemophilus influenzae can convey the infection as well. This bacterium produces toxins that interfere with ciliary movement and damage the mucosa. 7 The stagnation of secretions caused by decreased ciliary movement creates a perfect culture medium for viral or bacterial growth. 8 People at higher risk for contracting acute sinusitis include those who are immunocompromised and those who work closely with other people.",

            "text": "The conventional medicine treatment strategy for acute sinusitis emphasizes the use of antibiotics. In the United States, 85% to 98% of sinusitis patients are prescribed antibiotics. 6 However, evidence shows that most cases of acute sinusitis are viral in origin and only a marginal number of cases develop a secondary bacterial infection. 9 Other pharmaceutical agents that are employed for the treatment of acute sinusitis are oral or topical decongestants, topical anticholinergics, antihistamines, mucolytics, nasal corticosteroids, and hypertonic saline nasal irrigation. 7 However, the research related to the efficacy of the other forms of therapy for acute sinusitis is limited. In most of the studies, antibiotics are combined with decongestants or nasal irrigation and in some cases corticosteroids were prescribed as well. [10] [11] [12] These studies were shown to reduce the severity of symptoms. In 1 study conducted by Bahtouee et al, administering a nasal decongestant with the antibiotics amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, pseudoephedrine, and intranasal saline produced no additional benefit. 10 In addition, a study by Ragab et al determined that nasal irrigation was as effective as systemic antibiotics after 14 days of treatment. 13 However, a systemic review analyzed the effectiveness of saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute sinusitis and the authors concluded that there was some evidence of symptom relief, but the studies did not have a large enough study group and there was a high risk of bias. 14 Because most cases of acute sinusitis are viral in nature and antibiotics are used to prevent secondary infections, the actual efficacy of using antibiotics as the primary therapeutic approach is questionable. In addition, there are a small number of studies administering anticholinergics and antihistamines for the treatment of acute sinusitis. Of these studies, most are typically used for allergic rhinitis rather than acute viral sinusitis. 15 Lastly, Venekamp et al performed a meta-analysis and found that oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy are ineffective. 16 Although viral acute sinusitis is self-limiting, without treatment complications may ensue. 17 The complications that occur most often are orbital cellulitis, orbital abscess, epidural empyema, and subdural empyema. 9 A natural alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of either bacterial or viral sinusitis is Glycyrrhiza glabra, also known as licorice root, sweet root, or sweet wort. 18 It grows in Southwest and Central Asia and Europe. 19 This herb is a perennial that can reach heights of 1 to 2 m and is anchored in the ground by a taproot, which can reach 1.25 m in length. Each year a new stem grows with branches that can give rise to flowers, leaves, or fruit. The inflorescence of the plant have a spike like appearance with bluish to light purple flowers. 18 G glabra is one of 30 different species of plants in the Glycyrrhiza genus and family Leguminosae. 20 The first documented use of G glabra for medicinal purposes dates back to ancient Assyria and Egypt around 2500 BC. 20 The part of the plant that is used medicinally is the roots and stolons. 20 Traditionally, G glabra is used for reducing inflammation, preventing ulcers, acting as a mucolytic, blocking calcium channels, and inhibiting microbial growth. 20 G glabra is considered to be generally safe. However, prolonged use of this agent is not recommended because it can result in hypertension, edema, cardiac symptoms including cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias, pseudohyperaldosteronism in conjunction with hypercortisolism with polyuria, myopathies, lethargy, headaches and tetany, retention of sodium and a severe disruption of electrolyte balance. 18 Chronic consumption has resulted in hypertensive encephalopathy in 2 cases. 18 Excessive dosages have been associated with hepatotoxicity, metabolic alkalosis, a reduction in testosterone, and visual disturbances. 18 G glabra is contraindicated in individuals with chronic hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, severely impaired renal function, neuromuscular disorders with hypertonicity, cardiac dysfunction with arrhythmias, hypertension, hypertonia, and hypokalemia. 18 G glabra is an herb that has the ability to act as an antiviral against hepatitis B and C, influenza A, herpes simplex virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, the coronavirus, and the respiratory syncytial virus. 20 The antiviral components of G glabra are glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid. 20 Several antivi-ral actions for G glabra have been established, which are specific for the virus it encounters. 20 It has been shown to prevent the fusion of the virus with the membrane of the host cell, increasing the synthesis of interferon \u03b3 in T lymphocytes and inhibiting enzymatic activity of viruses, impairing replication. 20 One of the antiviral functions of G glabra discussed previously is the potentiation of the production of interferon \u03b3 by T lymphocytes, which activates and mobilizes immune cells to combat the infection. 21 Another effect of G glabra is the suppression of the enzymatic activity of neuraminidase. 22 Neuraminidase is found on the surface of the virus and facilitates the cleavage of sialic acid residues, allowing the active form of the virus to detach from the virally infected host cell. 22 Separating from the infected host cell is required for viral replication and transmission. 22 There are 11 components in G glabra that inactivate viral neuraminidase activity in several strains of influenza including the H1N1 virus and an oseltamivir-resistant strain of H1N1. 22 There are a few studies that demonstrate the antimicrobial and antiviral properties of G glabra. 19, 23, 24 However, at present, there are no studies demonstrating the efficacy of G glabra for the treatment of acute sinusitis. Furthermore, no studies that determine the effectiveness of G glabra against the rhinovirus, the parainfluenza virus, or the H influenzae bacterium exist, and the few studies that elucidate the antiviral activity of G glabra against influenza are in vitro or use G. glabra as part of a formulation. The purpose of this case report is to discuss the treatment of a young adult female with acute sinusitis with the administration of G glabra.",

All of these treatment strategies may have had a therapeutic effect that cannot be discounted. Acupuncture, zinc, A sativum, and O vulgare all have the potential to enhance immune function.

A sativum and O vulgare are also antimicrobial.

Down-regulating the activity of these enzymes increases the circulating levels of cortisol. 20, 34 Additional evidence has demonstrated that glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid interact with glucocorticoid receptors and may have a regulatory effect. 20, 34 However, the regulatory effect is weak. 34 There are 2 studies that exemplify the potential modulatory effects of G glabra. The first study was performed by Methlie et al using G glabra in patients with Addison's disease. 35 G glabra increased serum cortisol levels for 2.6 hours after consumption, 35 whereas in a study conducted by Armanini et al, glycyrrhetinic acid was administered topically onto the thighs of 18 healthy women. 36 The application of glycyrrhetinic acid decreased the activity of cortisol in the adipocytes. 36 This demonstrates the ability of G glabra to potentially regulate cortisol activity.",

Respiratory burst uses ROS to eradicate pathogens. The combination of glucocorticoid release and respiratory burst promoting the synthesis of ROS increases the level of oxidative stress and can impair the antioxidant defense system. 37 Using antioxidant supplements has been shown to prevent dysfunction of the antioxidant defense system, diminish ROS, and reduce serum cortisol, mitigating the immunosuppressant effect. 38 However, the effects of G glabra on cortisol are considered to be analogous to that of the administration of oral corticosteroids for the treatment of acute sinusitis, but to a lesser extent. The practice of prescribing oral corticosteroids for certain infections is becoming more prevalent. The reason is that inflammation occurs parallel to the infection. Administering a cortisol agonist can dissipate the inflammatory response, which can alleviate symptoms at least temporarily. 39 Although cortisol has an immunosuppressive effective, the down-regulation of inflammation could lower cortisol levels over the long-term. Higher levels of inflammation are positively correlated with higher levels of cortisol release. 40 Consequently, the effect of G glabra may attenuate the release of cortisol over time by a similar mechanism.",

Consequently, the exact extent of activity of G glabra that has a positive effect toward the alleviation of an infection is difficult to distinguish.

G glabra may be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of an acute case of viral or bacterial sinusitis either alone or in combination with other antiviral or mucolytic agents.",
