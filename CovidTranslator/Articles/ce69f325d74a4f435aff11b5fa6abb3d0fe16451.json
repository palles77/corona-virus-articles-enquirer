            "text": "The pathologic lesions caused by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infections comprise a wide spectrum of both types and degrees, and are, like the clinical manifestations,6, 102, 114 a result of the interactions of factors such as strain and biotype of the virus (see the article by Donis, this issue), 35, 36, 51-53, 60,77,113,116,121 ,122 the host genotype, age, and immune status of the animal at the time of infection, the immune response induced, and intercurrent infections or other stress factor(s). 2, 29, 44, 45, 96 Some of the lesions are not specific for BVDV, reflecting the limitations in tissue reactions to noxae or parallels in pathogenic mechanisms. In other cases, only microscopic or submicroscopic changes are present, and, thus, not apparent in a routine postmortem examination. Other lesions, or rather simultaneous occurrence of a set of lesions, however, may be near pathognomonic for BVDV, and when combined with clinical manifestations and epidemiologic data, they can have conclusive diagnostic value. The latter may be the case for \"typical\" mucosal disease (MD) and for the occurrence of congenital defects of epidemic proportions. With the improvements in and wider application of virus diagnosis in clinical practice, however, it has become apparent that BVDV may be the cause of a much wider spectrum of clinical and pathologic phenomena, some of which in the past probably went undetermined. 96 Traditionally, the pathologic (as well as clinical) manifestations of BVDV infection are presented under the categories (1) fetal infections, (2) acute virus diarrhea, (3) MD. This categorization will largely be maintained, although it should be emphasized that these groupings are only truly useful for didactic purposes, and that extensive overlap can be expected in the occurrence and severity of any particular type of lesion, between animals or outbreaks,I4, 18, 36, 113, 114 and that pathologic lesions can only be suggestive of a BVDV infection. A final diagnosis must rest on isolation of the virus and/or detection of specific viral antigen in appropriate samples.",

Considering the difficulties often encountered in field cases in retrospectively establishing the exact time for the fetal infection, much emphasis has been given to the experimental evidence of the gestational agedependency of particular types of pathology. Although this temporal categorization will not be disputed and is used here, it should be remembered that the possibility that some BVDV strains may have relatively low pathogenicity; therefore, their effect may be more insidious or slow, resulting in morphologic and/or clinical manifest changes only after a prolonged effect on the germinal tissues. 14 , 17, 111, 146 Additionally, lesions that have been examined and seem to be similar in the perinatal period of a full-term calf may be the end stage of basically different processes, e.g., interference with normal stem cell differentiation and tissue development versus repair processes after an inflammatory process. 12 , 14, 41, 72 Conclusive differentiation between these possibilities based on morphologic criteria may not be possible. 14 Fetal infections in the first trimester of gestation may result in embryo/fetal death followed by absorption, mummification, or abortion, with expulsion occurring at any time up to several months later. Pathologic and virologic examinations, therefore, are rarely informative if performed on isolated cases at the time of expulsion. lo , 105 As previously suggested, some of the congenital defects observed in full-term calves that often are ascribed to infections in the second trimester actually may have been caused by infections at the time of organ blastems differentiation in the first trimester, whereas an infection in the second trimester is more likely to provoke an inflammatory response and result in reparatory rather than regenerative processes and, thus, organ defects. 14 , 40, 41 The teratogenic lesions recognized as possible consequences of a intrauterine infection with BVDV are listed in Table l .",

Although thymocytes seem to be responsive (or susceptible) to signals for apoptosis such as antigen at inappropriately high levels or presented in the absence of appropriate costimulatory signals, corticosteroids, or certain cytokines,47, 90, 92,97,141 it may be questioned whether the BVDV infection is the cause of the atrophy or whether other events (parturition stress, neonatal infection, insufficient nutrition) around the time of delivery are the (additional?) cause(s) of an acute involution, which could have been reversible and inconsequential given time and appropriate care. l1 , 68 The generalized intra-uterine growth retardation, most often noted in PI calves (see section on persistent infection without overt clinical disease) may have significant clinical implications in relation to the \"weak-calf syndrome,\" although the extent of the problem is not known because of the defect's subtle character (see the article by Baker, this issue). 114 Intra-uterine infection in the last trimester is not usually thought to cause serious consequences for the fetus.

In many cases, however, these do not seem to be accompanied by gross pathologic changes, and are thought to be a consequence of high fever and/or abdominal pain. 1l4 In other cases, particularly in young animals, either PI or infected postnatally, BVDV is seen as a predisposing factor for bacterial infection, similarly to that of bovine herpesvirus-I (BHV-I), parainfluenza-3, and others. 3, 22, 29 In PI calves, BVDV can be isolated from lung tissue, and virus antigen is widespread in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, however, without accompanying histopathologic changes (see section on persistent infection without overt clinical disease and Fig. 5 ).17 Conversely, a proportion (the size varying with study) of cattle succumbing to BRD are positive for BVDV, by virus isolation from or antigen detection in lung tissue, but the ensuing pathologic changes cannot be distinguished from those of other viral pathogens in the BRD complex (perhaps with the exception of BHV-P5), and usually are dominated by the pathology caused by the secondary bacterial agent. 3 , 29, 96 It is quite conceivable, although it remains to be shown experimentally, that the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the respiratory tract pathology of BHV -I plus bacteria also occur in BVDV -associated respiratory disease. 19 , 22,94,115,116 Whether strain differences exist with respect to pneumopathogenicity as it does for other aspects of the BVDV complex remains unresolved. 43 , 113, 115, 116 Although of considerable interest in its own right and as a model-system for host-virus interactions,2\u00b0 an elucidation of this aspect may require an extensive experimentation.",

However, in other, more limited studies of PI animals (natural or experimental infections), histopathologic lesions were detected in some, but not all, 17, 18 clinically healthy animals, and comprised local interstitial infiltrations of mononuclear cells (MNC) in kidneys and local thickening of the glomerular basement membrane,15, 54, 70 mild accumulation of MNC in liver triads, increased frequency of peribronchiolar lymphonoduli, and microfocal necrosis in the epithelium of the tongue and esophagus accompanied by moderate subepithelial MNC accumulation. 15 Conspicuously, in these same studies the lymphoid tissues of PI animals were indistinguishable from those of normal animals of comparable age and environmental exposure. 1 8 ,54 In animals with obvious growth retardation, both macroscopic and microscopic evidence of skin lesions may be present. Macroscopically, the changes may resemble those seen in chronic MD (see section on the gross pathology of acute and chronic MD) and consist of varying degrees of scurfiness and shallow erosive lesions around orifices and in the interdigital cleft. Microscopically, the changes may vary from slight attenuation of the rete pegs and mild subepithelial MNC infiltration (mainly macrophages) to more pronounced changes of parakeratotic and hyperkeratotic character, as seen in MD (see section on mucosal disease). Similar changes may be found in the keratinized epithelia of esophagus, rumen, reticulum, and omasum. Frank epithelial necrosis, however, is not common. 15 Mild retina lesions, of a type described in the section on congenital infections and not diagnosed clinically, may also occasionally become evident on histologic examination.",

This distribution is similar to what is found in cases of MD, but differs with respect to extent, i.e., number of cells infected and/or virus antigen-labeling intensity, potentially reflecting virus-replication level and/or the biotype present. 66 This phenomenon is most notable in the gut in which in the fundi of the crypts of PI healthy cattle only few, often scattered, cells were found to be infected in comparison to more uniform infection in MD calves (Figs. 2 and 6).13,17,91 Moreover, epithelial infection was not detected beyond the ileocaecal orifice. Below this anatomical site the alimentary infection was confined to intraepitheliallymphocytes and MNC in the propria. 17 Before euthanasia, virus was not or was only intermittently isolated from fecal samples, whereas NCP BVDV was readily isolated from blood and nasal swabs. IS The clinically healthy PI animals also may differ from MD cases with respect to virus distribution in the CNS, although some discrepancies have been noted between published reports. In several studies, widespread occurrence of viral antigen in neurons, especially in the deep lamina of the cerebral cortex, was described,54, 64, 71, 144 whereas other studies have found that only microglia (macrophage-like cells) may be infected in PI clinically normal cattle, and large neurons only became virus-antigen positive in animals with MD.15 Likewise, discrepancies exist regarding the presence of virus antigen in endothelial cells of small vessels, although the latter may be explained by the use, in some studies, of antibodies with nonspecific affinity for endothelia and/or adventitial cells. 27 As an extension of PI cells of the lymphoid tissues, a proportion of peripheral blood MNC seems to contain BVDV antigen and replicating virus 16 , 17, 24, 31, 37, 95, 132 with no or only minor apparent consequence for total leukocyte numbers, relative frequencies, or the fine structure of the cells, perhaps with the exception of slight \"activation\" of the blood monocytes. 24 Whereas there is agreement between reports as to the virus-carrier state of blood monocytes and T lymphocytes, there seems to be some discrepancy with regard to the B lymphocytes. 16, 31, 37, 95, 132 Whether this is ascribable to differences in methodology (including sensitivity and specificity of reagents), host genotype or virus strains involved remains unclarified, as does the importance of the infection of the leukocyte types to the pathogenic processes (see the section on Multifactorial Nature of MD Pathology).13, 102",

Underneath the dry scales, the corium seem hyperemic and occasionally thickened. Where the crustous formations are well-delineated, a hyperemic zone can be observed in the edge as well as local alopecia. In some cases, the dermatitis is of a generalized seborrhagic nature with hyperkeratinization and alopecia. Erosive lesions may be found in the perineal area, around the preputial opening or vulva. Erosive lesions with or without lichenification and exudation are also common in the interdigital cleft and around the skin-hoof junctions. Suppuration may occur due to secondary bacterial infection, although this is less common than might be expected.

The descriptions of changes in the thymus and Peyer's patches to follow, therefore, are based on natural cases of MD in which a staging was attempted based on clinical appearance and duration of the disease. 9 In acute cases of brief duration (1-4 days) the overall structure of the thymus is retained, but a clear reduction occurs primarily affecting the cortex, which may be dominated by apoptotic and disintegrating thymocytes (Fig. SA) , prominent epithelial cells and large, actively phagocytosing macrophages.

Using macrophage differentiation markers as immunocytochemical target antigens, it was determined that the majority of macrophages in the infiltrates may be relatively undifferentiated but highly activated,18, 28, 33 and this may reflect a highly dynamic process with continuous influx from the blood circulation and either premigratory or postmigratory activation. 33 Macrophages of all maturation stages as well as T lymphocytes occur in the lamina propria of the digestive tract (inclusive in Peyer's patches) with occasional focal concentration of CD8+ cells perivenularly.",

            "text": "The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis and pathology of BVDV infections in general and in MD in particular, so far has only attracted limited attention/I, 25, 33 but deserves thorough investigation. Lesions comparable to those seen in the intestines, lymphoid tissues, and cutaneous epithelia can be provoked by either overexpression, overproduction, or gene-disruption of several cytokines, including TNFa/ 6 ,73 GM-CSF, 85 TGFfj,129 and IL-6.32, 74 The lesions characteristic of BVD-MD are likely to have a multifactorial cause: by a combination of virus-cpe and specific and nonspecific immune responses, with the latter comprising local cytokine production by nonlymphoid cells as well as macrophages and perhaps CDS + T cells and \"null\" cells in response to cell injury or other cytokines. In the unveiling of such mechanisms, however, it will be crucial to take into account the temporal relationships.22, 57,112 Liebler et al have begun such studies, but much remains to be done. 91 Another aspect of the pathogenesis of MD that needs clarification is the tissue/cell location for the events leading to a biotype change.I, 98, 99, 136 A number of studies have documented that flavivirus genome mutations and selection of variants only occur in certain cell types. 50, 93 It is notable that the CP virus seems to have a somewhat restricted distribution,66,91 and it is even more notable that this includes FDC, tissue macrophages, and other dendritic cells. A similar, although not identical, distribution was described in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infections in which specific types of mutations in the viral genome caused the virus to become either macrophage-tropic, lymphocytotropic, or both, i.e., amphotropic. 1 ,80 Likewise, in visna virus infection tissue tropism is determined by a specific genome segment. 131 Although the noted distribution for CP-BVDV cannot be taken to imply that these are the types of cells in which the change(s) occurs, the preferential replication of CP-BVDV in professional antigen presenting cells (APC) makes it possible that the cleavage products of the 125kDa protein, after genomic changes, are processed and presented differently to the immune system than NCP-virus products. 106 The tolerant state may be \"broken\" with the subsequent development of immunopathologic, perhaps even autoimmune-like, disease.109, 123 That a measurable antibody (AB) response does not always occur,11, 15,62 which might other-wise be expected,65, 147 does not contradict this hypothesis, because such a response would not only depend on a time-factor, i.e., survival time, but also on the type of T-cell response induced. 4 , 103, 104, 112, 142 If this is preferentially a CD8+ T-cell response, which might be inferred from the predominance of CD8 + to CD4 + cells in inflammatory foci, submucosae, and lymphoid tissues,18 and is followed by destruction of antigen-positive cells, including the FDC (see Figs. 9B and 12),108 the B-cell response would be abrogated?9, 117 Such mechanisms have been demonstrated to occur in LCMV infection,108 and are thought to take place in HIV infections. 63 If at the same time as the APC are presenting \"new\" virus-protein epitopes to the immune system one or more of their accessory functions, such as expression of co stimulatory surface molecules or production of cytokines, have been altered directly or indirectly due to the virus infection, 1 apoptosis may be the outcome rather than stimulation of a proliferative T-cell response. 89 , 141 Such a scenario could be invoked to explain the apparent \"acuteness\" of thymocyte depletion (see Fig. 8A ), as well as lymphocyte depletion of peripheral lymphoid tissues. 117 In addition, factors such as corticosteroids and sudden excessive release of certain cytokines may contribute to the depletion by directly inducing apoptosis in lymphocytes. 48 ,90 The resulting disruption of lymph node, Peyer's patches, and tonsil architecture would result in an abnormal (even if in some cases subtle) distribution of lymphocytes within these tissues. This reaction combined with the productive virus infection of both lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (see Figs. 2 and 12) may profoundly impair normal cell-cell interactions. 16 , 17, 31, 66 Such mechanisms may help to explain why neither T nor B lymphocytes are particularly prominent in the inflammatory processes in epithelial lesions. 18 Furthermore, the absence of de novo expression of MHC class II antigens on endothelia and epithelia suggest that either IFN-y is not produced locally to any significant extent/ 2 ,25 or the IFN-y effect is antagonized by other cytokines. Because inflammatory macrophages in the lesions express high levels of MHC class II antigen, however, this would suggest that cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF~ may not play major roles in the inflammatory reactions,55, 139, 140 despite at least the latter's known involvement in skin pathology.38, 129 Instead, to explain the inflammatory process in the cutaneous epithelia the role of IL-1u and IL-1~ may be invoked. Keratinocytes are known to express large amounts of intracellular pro-IL-1u and pro-IL-~.82, 101 Cell injury, due to virus-CPE or a cell-mediated cytotoxic response, would result in release of the cytokines. Because pro-IL-1u is biologically active, its release could initiate the inflammatory reaction by induction of adhesion molecules on endothelia and the production, by keratinocytes and macrophages, of chemokines and other proinflammatory cytokines such as CSFs, IL-6, TNFu, and fibroblast and keratinocyte growth factors. 81 The process may start with the damage of only a few keratinocytes, and thereby create the impression of MNC-infiltration preceding the epithelial lesions (see section on histopathology of MD and see Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, it is possible that such a process could become self-perpetuating. 81 An alternative, although not a mutually exclusive possibility, is that the cutaneous lesions in MD are initiated by CP-BVDV replication in Langerhans cells. These cells are potent APC and cytokine producers,86 and the latter function could be envisioned to be upregulated on infection, in particular of such pro-inflammatory mediators as IL-l, IL-6, TNFa, and chemokines, which subsequently could stimulate the keratinocytes as well as attract macrophages. Another possibility is virusinduced depletion of Langerhans cells, directly or indirectly,l28 with subsequent loss of an important immunoregulatory component of the skin. 4, 8, 124, 133 Thus the question of distribution and density variation of epidermal and mucosal Langerhans cells as a determining factor in the distribution and/or severity of the lesions in cutaneous epithelia, such as has been described in other dermatologic reactions,39, 130, 138, 145 becomes pertinent. So far the cutaneous lesions characteristic for MD have received comparatively little attention; further study in this area is needed.",
