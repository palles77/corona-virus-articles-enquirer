The prototypical species Alphacoronavirus 1 is composed of the following prototypical virus 72 strains (6): feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), and transmissible gastrointestinal 73 enteric virus (TGEV). FCoV is an Alphacoronavirus of particular interest as it manifests as two distinct 74 biotypes or pathotypes with a highly transmissible form, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) that provokes 75 self-limiting, usually mild enteric tract infections, and a systemic form, feline infectious peritonitis virus 76 (FIPV), typically associated with low transmissibility but high morbidity (7). In the widely accepted \"internal 77 mutation\" hypothesis, it is believed that genetic mutations in the genome of FCoV occur within an infected 78 animal, giving rise to FIPV (8). A similar FIP-like pathogenesis phenomenon is also observed with ferret 79 coronaviruses (FRCoV) (9). While CCoV is a widespread enteric virus of dogs and can occur in highly 80 pathogenic forms, the virus does not manifest itself with FIP-like clinical signs (10). 81",

Previous 86 serological characterizations of alphacoronaviruses, based on the antigenicity of the S glycoprotein, have 87 revealed the existence of two FCoV serotypes (serotype I and II) (13-15). Both serotype I and II FCoV 88 can manifest as either FECV and FIPV biotypes. FCoV serotype I is more prevalent in cats than serotype 89 II, but has proved more difficult to culture in vitro (16, 17) . Similarly in strains of CCoV, a common enteric 90 virus of dogs, two serotypes (CCoV I and II) have also been characterized, and are distinguished by 91 genetic differences in the S and ORF3 genes. Serotype II CCoV strains can be further subdivided into the 92 IIa, IIb, and IIc subtypes (10). CCoV IIa and IIb strains are distinguished by differences in the N-terminal 93 domain of the S protein (NTD), where the IIb NTD is closely related to TGEV NTD. The recently 94 characterized IIc subtype of CCoV has been reported in Sweden and in the United States. 95",

It is thought that serotype I FCoV and CCoV originated from a common 97 ancestor. A recombination event occurring between a serotype I CCoV with an unknown coronavirus 98 gave rise to serotype II CCoV which acquired a recombinant S protein, distinct from serotype I S 99 envelope glycoprotein. TGEV appears to have originated from a serotype II CCoV (18). Additional, 100 independent recombination events between serotype I FCoV and serotype II CCoV gave rise to serotype 101 II FCoV, such as FIPV WSU-79-1146 and FECV WSU-79-1683, which acquired a serotype II CCoV S 102 protein (19). Furthermore, we have previously shown that CCoV strain A76 also has a recombinant S 103 protein, a product of recombination between serotype I and II CCoV sequences (20) . CCoV-A76 S was 104 shown to have a serotype I-like NTD, while the rest of the protein was serotype II-like. Analysis of 105 coronavirus recombination events within the S protein sequence revealed its modular nature, allowing 106 exchanges of functional domains between co-infecting viruses (5, 20) . 107",

A less conserved site is found for serotype I 165 FCoV and CCoV, however all are less basic in nature and lack the K-R-K motif observed in all serotype II 166 sequences. In a similar fashion to the alignment at the S1/S2 site, CCoV-A76 S2' site aligned best with 167 serotype II sequences. 168 .

Our approach allows for 198 a better understanding of the complex phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history observed in 199 coronaviruses. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis on S proteins can reveal relationships that are not 200 observed using ORF1ab or complete genome-based analysis. In particular, in a study characterizing 201 novel deltacoronaviruses, Woo and colleagues showed that the S proteins of alphacoronaviruses are 202 more closely related to deltacoronaviruses than to other coronavirus genera (3). During our phylogenetic 203 analyses, we took note of a distinct Alphacoronavirus S protein sequence from the Asian leopard cat 204 coronavirus (accession no. ABQ39958.1) and noticed its much smaller size (1035 amino acids) compared 205 to other alphacoronaviruses (1466 and 1356 amino acids for FCoV-RM and HCoV-NL63 respectively). 206",

The Coronaviridae family is divided into the Torovirinae and Coronavirinae 59 subfamilies, both of which contain viral species characterized by their exceptionally large RNA genomes 60 in the 26.4-31.7 kb and 26.6-28.5 kb ranges, respectively. Torovirinae and Coronavirinae subfamilies 61 members are able to infect a diverse array of vertebrate species. They have a distinct genomic 62 architecture and replication strategy shared with other members of the Nidovirales order, which also 63 includes the Arteriviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Roniviridae families (1, 2). Coronaviruses (CoV) are 64 classified into four genera, with Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus containing members that infect 65 mostly mammalian species, and Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus grouping viruses infecting both 66 birds and mammals (3). The zoonotic emergence of highly pathogenic human betacoronaviruses, severe 67 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome 68 coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, have renewed interest for the study of coronaviruses and highlighted 69 their propensity for recombination and to cross the species barrier (4, 5). 70",

Serotype I FCoV and CCoV clustered in one group and serotype II FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV 171 grouped in another. Furthermore, the CCoV-A76 strain is found at an intermediate position between the 172 two serotype groupings(20), a result that reflects the recombinant nature of its S protein. This 173 phylogenetic analysis clearly demarcates strains according to the previously characterized serotypes and 174 not according to which host species the strains infect, as was observed when performing the analysis with 175 complete genome or ORF1ab sequences. Using such S-based phylogenetic analyses, we propose that 176 the Alphacoronavirus 1 species be sub-classified as clade A, corresponding to serotype I FCoV and 177CCoV, and clade B, corresponding to serotype II FCoV and CCoV and TGEV-like viruses.178 179 Discussion 180 Current classification within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species is not well defined and often fails to 181 recognize the profound differences observed between well-established Alphacoronavirus 1 serotypes. 182 Adding to the confusion are the different terms used to designate various Alphacoronavirus 1 strains: 183 FCoV serotypes and types; CCoV serotypes, types, and genotypes; and TGEV which is not classified 184 according to FCoV/CCoV serotypes. We propose a more unified classification, based on the important 185 differences between the S proteins of serotype I and II viruses. Our analysis reveals two well-defined 186 clades, clade A and clade B, corresponding to the serotype groupings. Both clades contain FCoV and 187 CCoV strains, while TGEV only belongs to clade B, in agreement with the finding that TGEV is most 188 related to clade B (serotype II) CCoV. We recommend the inclusion of representatives of both clades 189 when performing phylogenetic analysis of alphacoronaviruses. The proposed classification scheme for 190 the alphacoronaviruses is similar to the one used to characterize lineages and clades of avian influenza 191 viruses. Indeed, instead of performing phylogenetic analyses on the entire genomes, avian influenza 192 classifications are based on the surface proteins genes, e.g. hemagglutinin (HA) (24). 193In addition to better matching serological and phylogenetic groupings, S-based phylogenies offer 194 other advantages. Because the S gene is frequently shuffled by recombination events, such 195 classifications allows the grouping of viruses that have a shared S gene. In our analyses,",
