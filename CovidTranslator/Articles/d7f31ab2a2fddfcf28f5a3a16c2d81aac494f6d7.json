            "text": "While most of the anti-HCMV approved drugs, except fomivirsen, are inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase, compounds with different mechanisms of action have also appeared. Among them, the L-ribose benzimidazole derivative maribavir, targeting to the viral UL97 protein kinase, is currently under clinical trials. 7 A series of thiourea small-molecules were identified as potent anti-HCMV agents, inhibiting virion envelope fusion, and some piperidine-derived compounds were described as the first class of small-molecule ligands for the chemokine receptor US28, thus also acting at an early stage of the replication cycle. 8 Quite recently, some c-sultone derivatives with anti-HCMV activity were shown to keep full antiviral sensitivity against a panel of mutant HCMV strains, selected for resistance against approved drugs, and accordingly suggesting a new mechanism of action, which is still unclear. 9 The HCMV protease, essential for capsid assembly and viral maturation, is being considered an attractive target for anti-HCMV chemotherapy, and several structurally diverse inhibitors have been described. 10 Most of them include an activated carbonyl group or are mechanism-based inhibitors that covalently interact with the Ser residue within the enzyme active site. 11, 12 Among the latter, we and others have discovered simple and small b-lactam derivatives with anti-HCMV activity. 13, 14 In our case, a simple deletion of the carbonyl group of the b-lactam ring resulted in the corresponding azetidine derivatives, which behave as noncovalent inhibitors of HCMV replication. 14b Preliminary structure-activity relationship studies suggested the importance of a certain hydrophobic environment by the carboxylate in position 2 of the azetidine ring. Moreover, within this series, some C-terminal carboxamide derivatives showed restricted rotation around the N1-CO bond, due to the stabilization of a c-turn-like folded conformation. 14b To investigate further the structural and conformational issues within these azetidine derivatives and to determine their interest as antiviral agents, we initiated a program directed to the modification of compound 1, selected as a prototype (Fig. 1) . To this end, diverse substituents have been built-in the C-terminal carboxamide moiety (A), amino acids with side-chains of different character were selected as C-terminal residues (B), and the N-terminal benzyloxycarbonyl group was replaced by different urethane, acyl and urea moieties containing aromatic groups (C).",

The good results in the synthesis of compounds 7 prompted us to apply a similar solid-phase approach for the preparation of the third series of derivatives (Scheme 3). In this case, the Fmoc-L-Ala resin 5g was deprotected and coupled to the Fmoc-azetidine derivative 8 to provide key intermediate 9. Unfortunately, this coupling step was difficult and, despite it was repeated, the Kaiser test indicated an incomplete incorporation. The direct cleavage of 9 afforded after purification the Fmoc-azetidine dipeptide 10a. Removal of the Fmoc-protecing group from 9 followed by reaction with different chloroformates or acyl-or sulfonyl-chlorides in the presence of propylene oxide gave to derivatives 10b-g, after cleavage. Alternatively, the treatment with isocyanates, followed by exposure to the cleavage cocktail, allowed the preparation of urea analogues 10h-i. In all these cases, only the major S,S-diastereoisomer of the mixture was isolated in enough purity for biological assays. The deficient coupling of azetidine derivative 8 could be responsible for the formation of the complex reaction crudes, making the purification step more difficult.",

The results of the biological assays indicated quite strict structural requirements for activity. Thus, only derivatives with aliphatic groups at the C-terminal residue, either at the carboxamide moiety or at the side-chain showed significant inhibitory activity against HCMV replication in cell cultures. Additionally, at the C-carboxamide group, the presence of a hydrogen atom is an absolute requirement. Substitutions at N-terminus recommended the initial benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) group as the best choice at this position. In addition, the conformational restriction induced by the reverse turn (c-type) seems important for activity, since more flexible dipeptide analogues were totally inactive.
