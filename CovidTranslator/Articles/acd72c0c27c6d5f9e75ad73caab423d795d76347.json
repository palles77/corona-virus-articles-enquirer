Chris was a pillar of the antiviral research community, a long-time member and past president of ISAR. For me and many others, he was also a mentor, colleague and good friend. His many accomplishments will be honored at the 29 th ICAR, and we will feel his presence in spirit. His work will live on with the advances he pioneered and the many students and scientists he mentored, many of whom are active members of the Society. On behalf of ISAR, we send our condolences to the McGuigan family and to his many friends and colleagues on this tragic loss.",

Mark Prichard and his program team have worked hard to attract top speakers, and they've also revamped the abstract submission process and developed a new workshop on Diagnostic Technologies. The meeting will begin with a tribute to Chris and his contributions to science and to our society, followed by two keynote addresses. The first, by Richard H. Scheuermann of the J. Craig Venter Institute, will explore how the availability of whole-genome sequence data, combined with standard representations of phenotypic characteristics from large numbers of viral isolates, is allowing extensive genotype-phenotype association studies that go well beyond traditional phylogenetic lineage tracing. He will illustrate these concepts by focusing on two areas: the use of statistical genomic analysis to predict influenza virus evolution in the face of adaptive immunity and the identification of novel genetic determinants of disease severity in enterovirus D68.",

He will review the history of Marburg and Ebola viruses from their discovery through the recent West African epidemic. He will then provide a look ahead: what research is needed, where do we go from here? Lessons learned in West Africa are clearly critical to understanding how to prevent such a widespread epidemic in the future and to limit its global spread through air travel.",

Chris was an exceptionally bright medicinal chemist, with a very broad background and insights into widely different fields of human health research. He was best known for inventing a wide variety of phosphoramidate ProTides, which optimize intracellular drug delivery and circumvent metabolic bottlenecks in the activation of nucleoside-based antivirals and anticancer drugs. At least four compounds based on this technology have entered clinical trials, including Acelarin, now in Phase III evaluation for ovarian cancer and NUC3373, which is in Phase I trials for breast and colon cancer.

He also developed INX-189 for the treatment of hepatitis C, which reached Phase II trials, but was not pursued due to unexpected side-effects when trialed in conjunction with another drug. He also co-invented new glucosamine phosphates with potential use in osteoarthritis. In addition to his own achievements, Chris was an outstanding manager of a team of scientists from all over the world. He was quite demanding and extremely \"punctual,\" but a master at motivating his team members. At his annual Laboratory Away Day, when Ph.D. candidates and postdocs presented their results and future plans, he always invited a foreign expert to judge the results, and it was amazing to see how the students and collaborators were inspired by his drive and enthusiasm. He also possessed the art of teaching in a very entertaining manner, and could explain scientific results and their potential implications to an audience of scientists and non-scientists like no one else. Over his career, he trained more than 100 researchers, including more than 45 Ph.D. students.",

About eight years ago one of my grad students, Kartik Temburnikar, was assigned to tackle the extended pyrimidine part of the project. These were a series of Cnucleosides with thieno-and pyrrolo-pyrimidine bases. Interestingly, we had made the thiophene-expanded purine base back in 2000 1 , and it exhibited some anticancer activity, but it got buried in the excitement over the fleximer project, and was somewhat forgotten. When Kartik came across that paper four years ago, he decided to send both the nucleobases and the nucleosides for screening, and thank goodness he did! To make a long story short -Jan Balzarini did some tox studies, and this gave us our first clue that the compounds might have some value against cancers. Screening by NCI revealed low-nanomolar activity against a number of important cancers. A UMB collaborator observed tumor shrinkage of 50% in 7-14 days in a mouse melanoma xenograft model, with no toxicity (unlike temozolomide, the standard of care, which is fairly toxic). As a result, we then screened against other cancers, and recently obtained funding to test these compounds in animals, targeting leukemia and non-small-cell lung, pancreatic and triple-negative breast cancer. We're encouraged that these compounds may provide a cheaper alternative to some very expensive drugs.",

Before that time, coronaviruses were regarded as relatively harmless for humans, and I was one of the few scientists who bothered to investigate them, in spite of difficulties getting the work funded. My colleagues and I succeeded in determining the first crystal structure of any coronavirus protein, namely the main protease. This article describes the situation concerning the structure-based design of coronavirus protease inhibitors at the time of the SARS outbreak, and what has been achieved since that time.Rolf with Tsinghua colleague Zihe Rao in July, 2003, the weekend after Beijing was declared free of SARS and lab workers were allowed to leave the campus.My group, then at the University of Jena in the former East Germany, started working on coronavirus main proteases (M pro , also called 3C-like proteases) at about the turn of the millenium.

Among the major accomplishments of his career were the identification of hepatitis C virus antigen and hepatitis E virus antigen in the liver of infected patients and in animal models and the study of immunity to hepatitis B virus in nonhuman primates. His productive collaborations with the NIH and FDA and with prominent research centers in Europe, Asia, and Australia contributed to major public health gains.Kris was an active member of the American Association for the Study of the Liver Diseases (AASLD) and hardly missed any of the annual meetings. He enjoyed the camaraderie with other attendees, which resulted in many lasting friendships. In recognition of his excellence in research, he was elected a Fellow of the AASLD in 2014.I had the honor of knowing Kris since 1996, when he invited me to the United States as a postdoctoral fellow. When I first met him, I found a warm and welcoming person with a great sense of humor and a tremendous passion for scientific research.
