The viral glycoprotein (GP) facilitates host cell entry and, jointly with cellular interaction partners, constitutes a potential target for antiviral intervention. However, it is unknown whether the GPs of the currently and previously circulating EBOVs use the same mechanisms for cellular entry and are thus susceptible to inhibition by the same antivirals and cellular defenses. Here, we show that the GPs of the EBOVs circulating in 1976 and 2014 transduce the same spectrum of target cells, use the same cellular factors for host cell entry, and are comparably susceptible to blockade by antiviral interferon-induced transmembrane proteins and neutralizing antibody KZ52. Thus, the viruses responsible for the ongoing EVD epidemic should be fully susceptible to established antiviral strategies targeting GP and cellular entry factors.",

The first documented outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV, formerly Zaire ebolavirus) disease (EVD) occurred in Zaire and was associated with a case-fatality rate of 88% [2] . Subsequently, 22 EVD outbreaks were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa [2] . These outbreaks generally occurred in relatively remote areas, were contained by quarantine measures, and caused a maximum of 425 cases per outbreak (during the 2000-2001 EVD outbreak in Uganda). The ongoing EVD epidemic, which originated in Guinea [3] , differs markedly from previous outbreaks: it affects Western Africa and is associated with a higher death toll than all previously recorded outbreaks jointly [4] . The massive scale of the epidemic is likely due to the delayed public health response. However, the currently circulating viruses harbor >30 unique amino acid substitutions [5] , and it is currently unclear whether these mutations allow for more-efficient spread in and between humans, compared with viruses responsible for past outbreaks.",

            "text": "The EBOV glycoprotein (GP) is inserted into the viral envelope and facilitates viral entry into target cells [6, 7] . Moreover, GP is the sole target for the neutralizing antibody response. GP is synthesized in the constitutive secretory pathway of infected cells and consists of a surface unit, GP1, and a transmembrane unit, GP2 [6, 7] . The GP1 subunit contains an N-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD) [8, 9] , which binds to host cell receptors, and a C-terminal mucin-like domain (MLD), while the GP2 subunit contains functional elements required for fusion of the viral envelope with a host cell membrane. Cellular entry of EBOVs commences with uptake of virions into host cell endosomes. This process can be promoted by recognition of phosphatidylserine in the viral envelope by TIM proteins [10] and, via bridging molecules, TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer) [11] on the host cell surface or by binding of GP to host cell lectins [12, 13] . Within the endosome, cysteine proteases remove the MLD [14] , which allows the subsequent interaction of GP with the cholesterol transporter NPC-1 [15, 16] , and drug-induced accumulation of endosomal cholesterol blocks infectious entry [17, 18] . Finally, an incompletely characterized stimulus triggers the membrane fusion reaction [19] , which allows the release of the ribonucleoprotein complex into the host cell cytoplasm.",

Transduction efficiency was determined by quantification of luciferase activities in cell lysates at 30 hours (rhabdoviral pseudotypes) or 72 hours after transduction (retroviral pseudotypes), using commercially available kits (Promega, PJK). In some experiments, target cells were transduced to express interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins or were transfected to express cellular lectins, as described previously [18] , before transduction with GP-bearing pseudotypes. Alternatively, expression of EBOV entry factors was inhibited by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). For this, siRNA knock down in target cells was performed 24 hours prior to transduction by transfection of 5 pmol of siRNA (all Santa Cruz), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies).

Ebolaviruses infect a broad spectrum of cell types in cell culture [32] , but macrophages and dendritic cells constitute early and sustained targets in the infected host [33] . In contrast, lymphocytes are refractory to infection, both in vitro and in vivo [32, 33] . To analyze whether previously and currently circulating EBOVs show differences in host cell tropism and entry, we comparatively analyzed pseudotypes bearing the GPs of EBOV, strain Mayinga, 1976 (EBOV-GP 1976) and EBOV variant Makona (EBOV-GP 2014) [34] , which differ in 1 amino acid residue in the RBD and 16 amino acid residues in the MLD (Supplementary Figure 1) . Pseudotypes bearing VSV-G served as positive control, while pseudotypes bearing no GP were used as negative control. Both EBOV GPs were efficiently expressed in transfected cells and incorporated into retroviral particles ( Supplementary Figure 2) , and both mediated entry into the human cell lines 293T, Huh7, U373, RPE, HOS, and EA-hy with comparable efficiencies ( Figure 1A) . Similarly, transduction of macrophages obtained upon PMA treatment of THP-1 cells was comparable ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, both GPs were unable to facilitate transduction of a human B-cell line (Raji), a human T-cell line (Jurkat and a human T/B hybrid cell line (CEMx174; Figure 1B ).",

Finally, the ability of EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 to transduce bat cell lines (derived from Rousettus aegyptiacus and Hypsignathus monstrosus) was examined, since H. monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata can serve as natural reservoir for EBOVs [36] .

The lectins DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, ASGPR1, and LSECtin are known to augment GP-driven entry [12, 13, 37] and promoted transduction driven by EBOV-GP 1974 and EBOV-GP 2014 to similar extents while expression of CLEC5A, which binds Dengue virus [38] , had no effect (Figure 2A) . Moreover, both EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 used TIM-1 and Axl for entry into certain target cells ( Figure 2B ), while expression of NPC-1 was universally required for entry ( Figure 2B and 2C) . Finally, entry driven by both GPs was comparably inhibited by U18666A, which induces an NPC-1 knockout phenotype in cells [39] , and related compounds ( Figure 2C ), in the absence of unwanted cytotoxic effects (not shown).

We used a panel of inhibitors previously employed to study EBOV-GP protease use [40] , to determine whether EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 exhibit differences in their protease requirements. Entry driven by both proteins was comparably inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors CA074Me and CA074, which efficiently inhibit catB but have little or no effect on catL and catS activity [40] . In contrast, the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF had no effect on GP-driven entry, and none of the compounds tested modulated entry driven by VSV-G ( Figure 3A ), as expected [40] . These observations indicate that EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 both depend on catB activity for efficient transduction of 293T cells. However, EBOV-GP 2014 was less susceptible than EBOV-GP 1976 to blockade by a third inhibitor, CatL ( Figure 3B ), which inhibits catB and catL activity to similar extents [40] , suggesting subtle differences in the protease dependence of these GPs.",

Engineered expression of IFITM proteins in 293T cells had no appreciable impact on transduction mediated by Lassa fever virus GPC but reduced influenza virus HAdriven transduction, with inhibition by IFITM protein 3 being most efficient ( Figure 5 ), in keeping with published data [42] . Transduction by the 2 EBOV-GPs tested was also inhibited by IFITM protein expression, and no appreciable differences in inhibition efficiency were observed ( Figure 5) . Thus, the virus Host cell entry of EBOVs can be inhibited by GP-specific antibodies, and some neutralizing antibodies were shown to exert antiviral activity in the host. We assessed inhibition of EBOV-GP 1976-driven and EBOV-GP 2014-driven entry by antibody KZ52 (obtained from an EVD survivor), which targets GP2 [44] and displays antiviral activity in guinea pigs but not monkeys [27] . Entry driven by both GPs was comparably inhibited by preincubation of particles with KZ52, while this antibody had no effect on entry driven by VSV-G (Figure 6) , indicating that the epitope recognized by KZ52 is conserved between EBOV 1976 and EBOV 2014.",

Our results suggest that this is not the case: entry mediated by EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 was dependent on expression of the cholesterol transporter NPC-1 and was inhibited by compounds that induce accumulation of endosomal cholesterol. Moreover, expression of endogenous TIM-1 and Axl, which can augment GP-driven entry by binding directly (TIM-1) or via a bridging molecule (Axl) to PtdSer in the viral envelope [45, 46] , promoted entry driven by both EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014. The MLD of GP is heavily modified with Olinked glycans and is required for binding to certain host cell lectins [47] . The observation that the MLD of EBOV-GP 2014 contains 16 amino acid substitutions relative to the MLD of EBOV-GP 1976 suggested that engagement of cellular lectins might differ between these GPs. However, again no appreciable differences were observed. In keeping with the comparable entry factor use, both GPs facilitated entry into an identical spectrum of cell lines derived from bats, NHPs, and humans, including THP-1 cell-derived macrophages. The only consistent difference observed was a reduction of EBOV-GP 2014-mediated transduction of COS7 cells, relative to that mediated by EBOV-GP 1976. This effect might point toward subtle differences in entry factor use, which may not be detectable in the assay system used in the present study.",

The present study suggests that EBOV variants from 1976 and 2014 are susceptible to both defense mechanisms. Expression of IFITM proteins comparably inhibited host cell entry driven by EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014, potentially by increasing endosomal cholesterol levels [17, 18] . Moreover, entry driven by both GPs was blocked by neutralizing antibody KZ52, which was obtained from a human EVD survivor and targets GP2 [44] . Collectively, these results and the observations discussed above suggest that previously and presently circulating EBOV variants might use similar mechanisms for host cell entry, infect a similar spectrum of target cells, and might be comparably susceptible to inhibition by innate and adaptive immune responses.",

Pseudotypes carrying the indicated GPs were normalized for comparable infectivity and incubated with the indicated dilutions of monoclonal antibody KZ52 for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Thereafter, the complexes were used for transduction of 293T cells, and luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured 72 hours after transduction. Transduction in the absence of antibody was set as 100%. The results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown and are representative of 3 independent experiments.
