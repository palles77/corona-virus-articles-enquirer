            "text": "Outbreak of an infectious disease is defined as the occurrence of a disease above the expected level [1] . Over the past several years, many countries have experienced serious economic and health consequences due to outbreaks of infectious diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2015 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003. Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are facing a great need for preparation for infection outbreaks because of an increase in the number of residents with global aging. LTCFs are exposed to the risk of outbreaks owing to several factors. First, older residents in LTCFs are susceptible to infectious diseases because of aging and health conditions [2] and are known to be dependent with regard to activities of daily living. Thus, among residents, self-hygiene is observed to be poor. Loss of independence in residents creates unique and frequent contact opportunities between healthcare workers (HCWs) and residents [3] . Second, HCWs in LTCFs tend to be poorly informed about infection prevention and control (IPC), and compliance with IPC is generally low [2, 4] . Third, the environment in LTCFs offers challenges for IPC, like the sharing of rooms, group living, and difficulty with the isolation of infected persons [5, 6] . Finally, LTCFs have limited resources and capacities for diagnosis of infection [7] . This leads to a delay in the detection of hidden carriers and infection. All these factors contribute to the onset and spread of outbreaks in LTCFs. Outbreaks in LTCFs threaten the life and health of both residents and HCWs, and thus, eliminating the risk of outbreaks is a matter of concern in such facilities. However, LTCFs vary in their individual capacities to respond to outbreaks [8] . The keys to outbreak control are as follows: identification of the transmission causes and minimization of the spread through early initiation of control measures. Therefore, it is essential to understand the causes of transmission and the applied measures to control outbreaks in LTCFs.",

First, in many previous researches that addressed outbreaks, the focus was on pathogens, burdens, and adverse outcomes such as mortality [9, 10] . Based on the perceived importance of control measures, one of the purposes of this review was to explore and analyze in detail the control measures reported in studies. Secondly, pharmaceutical measures may have some limitations on effectiveness against newly emerging infectious diseases or resistant strains [3] and some pathogens may not have pharmaceutical interventions to be considered during outbreaks. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as hand hygiene and precautions should be utilized to prevent the transmission of outbreak pathogens, regardless of the evolution of infectious diseases. However, little attention has been paid to NPIs in studies concerning outbreaks in LTCFs [3] . This review focused on NPIs and ascertains the control measures based on the guideline for prevention and control of influenza outbreaks in LTCFs of the World Health Organization (WHO) [11] . Finally, to our knowledge, there is no published systematic review addressing overall outbreaks in LTCFs in the past 5 years.",

Six domains were evaluated including the selection of participants, confounding variables, exposure measurement, blinding for outcome assessment, incomplete outcome, and selective outcome reporting. According to the instruction for evaluation [13] , the risk of bias for each domain was determined as low risk, unclear risk and high risk. Studies with full-text including case-control analysis, cohort study was involved in the quality assessment. Studies that simply described the results of investigation without comparative analysis were not able to evaluate the domains of the tool.

Fifteen studies reported outbreaks caused by bacteria [15-17, 20, 22, 24, 27, 32-39] and 22 studies were outbreaks by viruses [14, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, [28] [29] [30] [31] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . The largest number of a single pathogen was influenza viruses [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] , followed by group A streptococcus (GAS) [17, 20, 24, 37, 38] . The most affected site was respiratory tract (n = 12) [32, 35, 36, 39-45, 48, 50] , followed by gastrointestinal (GI) tract (n = 10) [14, 16, 23, 26, 27, 31, 33, 46, 47, 49] . Other sites including skin and soft tissue and eyes were affected. The majority of the eligible studies reported one outbreak involving one facility (n = 31), while the study by Nguyen and Middaugh [49] described a gastroenteritis outbreak that was transmitted to eight facilities. Three studies analyzed the data of multiple outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis and influenza-like illness that occurred in multiple facilities for a certain period of time [14, 46, 48] . The outbreaks in 23 studies affected both the residents and HCWs [14, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 29, 31, 33, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] , and the outbreaks of 14 studies affected only the residents [15-19, 21, 24, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 42, 50] .",

Among the 29 studies, the median of the overall attack rate was 15.73%: 8.27% for bacterial outbreaks and 19.25% for viral outbreaks (Table 3 ). In 8 studies, it was not possible to calculate the rate due to lack of information. The highest attack rate of 73.17% was reported in an outbreak of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [50] , followed by Clostridium difficile (51.97%) [27] and viral gastroenteritis caused by norovirus and rotavirus (48.6%) [26] . Influenza-like illness had the median overall attack rate of 24.50%. The median attack rate among staff was highest for the acute gastroenteritis outbreaks.",

Causes of transmission in the eligible studies were reported as person-to-person transmission, contaminated water and food, and problems in practice (Tables 2 and 4 ). The following studies (n = 12) did not report or could not identify the cause of the outbreaks: 5 studies on influenza viruses, 2 on non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, 1 on hepatitis C virus, 1 on C. difficile, 1 on adenovirus, 1 on norovirus, and 1 on RSV and HMPV [14, 27, 29, 30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 44, 45, 48, 50] . The most commonly reported route of transmission was person-to-person [17, 22-24, 26, 31, 33, 35, 38, 41, 43, 46, 47, 49] . Of these studies, the human source of transmission was identified as the HCWs in six outbreaks [22, 24, 26, 38, 41, 49] and the residents in two outbreaks [17, 33] . The skin of a HCW was a reservoir for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks, leading to cross-infection, in the study by Maltezou et al. [22] . The large gastroenteritis outbreak affecting 394 people in 8 facilities was attributed to staff who worked at multiple facilities [49] . One study showed that three outbreaks of GAS recurred for three years because of continued person-to-person transmission from colonized residents [17] . In the study by \u0160ubelj and U\u010dakar [23] , person-to-person transmission resulted from delayed implementation of control measures. Contaminated water and food were sources of infection in five studies [16, 25, 26, 33, 46] . Hepatitis E outbreak was caused by contaminated tap water after heavy rain [25] , while the consumption of tap water was the suspected cause of one viral gastroenteritis outbreak [26] . Foodborne causes such as contaminated cake or meals were noted in three studies regarding Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella enteritidis, and gastroenteritis [16, 33, 46] .",

The most frequently observed problem was suboptimal hand hygiene, followed by personal protective equipment (PPE), and cleaning and disinfection. Investigation for the GAS outbreak in the study by Nanduri et al. [37] revealed that hand hygiene compliance among employees was 14-25%. Additionally, poor hand hygiene became a more critical factor that facilitated the transmission of acute gastroenteritis, particularly in LTCFs having close living conditions with frequent close contact between the staff and dependent residents [31] . Issues related to PPE had been addressed including inappropriate use of glove and improper storage of PPE [20, 24, 30, 31, 34, 37] . There were reports indicating the potential to cross-contamination by not-changing gloves between residents or by storage of PPE in the room of the index case [31, 34] . Breaches in disinfection and cleaning of the environment and equipment were associated with many outbreaks, most of them were GAS [20, 37, 38] or hepatitis B and C outbreaks [28, 30] . Three reports of GAS outbreaks found lapses in wound care practice such as inconsistent cleaning and disinfection [20, 37, 38] . The outbreaks of MDROs and hepatitis B reported device related issues including sharing of a device and inappropriate use of reusable devices [15, 18, 21, 34] . Hepatitis B and C outbreaks commonly reported that lapses during podiatry care and point-of-care testing procedures (blood glucose test and international normalized ratio monitoring) caused the transmission of bloodborne pathogens among residents [18, 19, 21, 28, 30] . The lapses included the sharing of contaminated equipment, improper disinfection, and poor hand hygiene adherence.",

All five studies that reported control measures used various types of social distancing measures including isolation, restriction of new admission and visitors, or cessation of group activities [23, 26, 27, 31, 49] . Active surveillance by symptom reporting for early detection of new cases was reported in two studies [27, 49] . Although four studies reported that staff members were affected by the outbreaks, only one study implemented work exclusion for ill employees and showed the lowest attack rate among staff [23] . Four studies reported intensive cleaning and disinfection of the environment [23, 26, 27, 31] . The implementation of more stringent procedures for cleaning and disinfection with diluted bleach was reported for outbreaks of C. difficile [27] . The study by Luque et al. [26] on viral gastroenteritis reported a relatively small number of interventions, showing a high attack rate of 48.63%. On the other hand, the study by \u0160ubelj and U\u010dakar [23] with the largest number of control measures among the five studies had a lower attack rate of 11.21% compared to the other outbreaks.",

Furthermore, two of the reports on MRPA and KPC-KP intensified the cleaning of the environment to interrupt the contamination of the environment. The study by Kanayama et al.

As the prevalence of MDROs is increasing in LTCFs [2] , they become a particular concern in these facilities.

            "text": "Influenza viruses and GAS accounted for a large number of single pathogens. This is similar to the results of the previous review showing that the largest number of aetiologic agents affecting outbreaks was influenza viruses in LTCFs from 1966 to 2008 [9] . First, in this review, five of the six influenza virus outbreaks occurred by the influenza A virus and the other by influenza B virus. Influenza-like illness included in the studies showed a median attack rate of 24.50%, similar to that of seasonal influenza, usually 20-30% [40] . Vaccine-related issues have been raised in influenza outbreaks that have occurred in LTCFs of highly immunized residents. This finding suggests some implications to prevent influenza outbreaks in LTCFs. Regarding vaccination coverage among staff, the study by Thomas [52] found that influenza episodes were reduced if an employee was vaccinated, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all healthcare worker get vaccinated annually [53] . Therefore, influenza vaccination among healthcare personnel should be considered to mitigate the risk of influenza outbreaks in LTCFs. Additionally, because vaccination does not provide complete protection, active daily surveillance for influenza-like illness is still recommended for all persons in LTCFs during influenza season [53] , which is evident by the outbreaks occurring in highly immunized LTCF population. Secondly, the GAS infection rate among older adults in LTCFs is from 3 to 8-fold higher than that of community-dwelling older adults, due to risk factors such as grouped living conditions, and underlying diseases [54, 55] . Five of the studies on the GAS outbreaks in this review reported a median attack rate of 2.43% in LTCFs, which is within the range of 1-30% reported in the previous study [56] . Three of them were long-lasting outbreaks with multiple clusters for more than 6 months, which suggested that an accurate identification of how pathogens spread was a fundamental step in outbreak control.",

Consequently, failure to adhere to basic infection control practice, including hand hygiene, disinfection, and cleaning, was found to be a practical issue of great importance on the transmission of the outbreaks in LTCFs. Some reports even mentioned that this issue ultimately caused their outbreaks [19, 21, 28] . Most studies showed that this problem contributed to their outbreaks by causing cross-contamination between hands, environments, and equipment. First, the hands of HCWs may be the sources of the outbreaks. Frequent close contacts between residents and HCWs in LTCFs increase the risk of widespread outbreaks. Incorrect hand hygiene among HCWs can result in hands remaining contaminated, and this may lead to the transfer of organisms to the environment and to other residents [57] . Like previous studies that already confirmed poor compliance with hand hygiene among HCWs [4] , one of the included studies reported that hand hygiene compliance was less than 30% [37] . Semmelweis demonstrated the role of hand hygiene in preventing infections transmitted by person-to-person [58] . Hand hygiene has a significant effect on reducing GI and respiratory infections [59] . The WHO recommends that hand hygiene should be performed at the following 5 key moments: before and after touching a patient, before clean/aseptic procedures, after body fluid exposure risk, and after touching a patient's surroundings [57] . Promotion of hand hygiene compliance through multimodal strategies has been proven to reduce healthcare-associated infection [60] . Multifaceted interventions such as WHO-5 strategies (including system change, training and education, monitoring and feedback, reminder and communication, and culture of safety) are generally effective in increasing and sustaining hand hygiene compliance at various settings [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . The same evidence has been reported from studies on LTCFs, suggesting improved hand hygiene reduces the infection rate or respiratory outbreaks [66, 67] .",

            "text": "Secondly, lapses in cleaning and disinfection could make equipment and the environment become a reservoir for transferring pathogens [68] . Most of the studies regarding this issue were on outbreaks of GAS, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis B and C virus, and they found a failure to adhere to proper disinfection and cleaning principles. First of all, the outbreaks of GAS and hepatitis B and C were linked with breaches in specific procedures. GAS outbreaks were usually relevant to wound care and hepatitis B and C to point-of-care testing. With the aforementioned hand hygiene, disinfection and cleaning were basic infection control practices that are included in standard precautions. The standard precautions consist of hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, reprocessing and disinfection of care equipment, waste and linen management, the prevention of needle stick injuries, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), if necessary [11] . The practice of standard precautions is the imperative basic approach for IPC that was applied to all residents assuming they had the potential for pathogen transmission [11] . Standard precautions are necessary practice, especially in LTCFs where the systems for diagnostic tests are poor and active surveillance is not generally done. Tailored ongoing education with multimodal strategies for HCWs would ensure that basic infection control principles and standard precautions are integrated into daily practice such as point-ofcare testing [69] . As a result, a reduction in threats of outbreaks can be guaranteed, as well as the safety and health of persons residing or working in LTCFs. Meanwhile, the studies on the outbreaks of gastroenteritis reported that there were lapses in decontaminating environment. Environmental contamination may have a critical role in the spread of these outbreaks. Importantly, norovirus and C. difficile that are capable of surviving in the environment for long periods of time require more consideration in environmental disinfection [70, 71] . For norovirus, the CDC has recommended more frequent cleaning and disinfection of rooms and high-touch surfaces with a hypo-chlorite (1000-5000 ppm) or other proper disinfectant [72] . The most effective control method for C. difficile was reported as disinfection and cleaning of rooms and high-touch surfaces with a chlorine-based solution (5000 ppm) [70, 71] .",

The results showed that the actual application of control measures may be far from what is recommended and implied that there are several challenges to overcome in outbreak management at LTCFs. First, acute care facilities like hospitals can successfully manage outbreaks through collaborative efforts with multiple experts [73] . However, most of the LTCFs in this review requested advice from public health authorities and organizations for unexpected outbreaks instead of organizing a multidisciplinary team. This may imply that LTCFs do not have sufficient capacity and expertise to individually plan, implement, and evaluate the management of outbreaks. Forming a local support network between acute hospitals and LTCFs at a regional level would be a potential way to close the gaps and to enhance outbreak control practices in LTCFs without adequate capacity [74] . Furthermore, training infection control professionals in facilities could facilitate early detection of outbreaks and timely interventions.",

            "text": "Secondly, this review found that many LTCF employees were affected by the outbreaks, which is consistent with the finding of the previous review [9] . However, it also revealed that work restriction for ill staff was not implemented well during the outbreaks in the LTCFs, which was not reviewed in the prior review [9] . Gastroenteritis outbreaks in this review had a higher median attack rate among staff than the other outbreaks, but only one study among them reported the application of work exclusion. Moreover, there were some reports that implied transmission attributable to sick employees. These results pointed out the role of presenteeism in LTCFs. Presenteeism among sick employees may have a role in either introducing pathogens or facilitating the transmission of outbreaks. The CDC recommends work restrictions for health care workers infected with or exposed to diseases such as diarrheal diseases, GAS, tuberculosis, and viral respiratory infection [75] . However, it may be challenging for LTCFs with fewer available resources to implement the exclusion of ill staff during outbreaks, given the fact that one study reported difficulty from understaffing as a result of work restriction [50] . The study by Widera et al. [76] suggested that daily screening of all staff members for symptoms during outbreaks on every shift may mitigate the impact of presenteeism. Considering that presenteeism is associated with various factors such as job security and lack of paid sick leave [77] , further discussion is needed for plans addressing this issue in LTCFs.",

They included understaffing, insufficient supply of products such as PPE, lack of expertise, and limited application of isolation [41, 46, 47, 50] . Many long-term care facilities have difficulty in applying isolation of infected persons due to the limited availability of isolation rooms [5] and concern about the adverse effects of isolation and additional precautions may affect the compliance with related practices [78] . For the same reason, some studies in this review used minimal types of isolation like enteric isolation. If single rooms are not available, facilities should consider applying the cohort measure or bed curtains as another method of isolation. In regard to this challenge, a study by Dumyati et al. [73] suggested a shift towards enhanced standard precautions or risk-based application of transmission-based precautions to uphold the quality of life of residents by HCWs. Future research should identify the rationale for the safety and effectiveness of this strategy or other options. Additionally, one qualitative study found that misunderstanding of the key concepts and recommendations of IPC contributed to under-utilization of transmission-based precautions [78] . Thus, emphasis should be on training and education of HCWs on transmission-based precautions.",

Most studies attempted on-site direct observation of infection control practices and product availability. Some studies of retrospective design used survey and interview among employees. However, it is difficult to find a study that investigated the compliance rate of control measures during the outbreaks. Only a few studies described gaps in the actual application after recommendations for control measures were made. Even several studies overlooked reporting control measures, especially NPIs [3] . Although this does not necessarily mean that they did not apply measures, for the purpose of this review some studies were excluded from the analysis of control measures. The Outbreak Reports and Intervention studies of Nosocomial Infection (ORION) statement was developed and recommended, to improve the quality of outbreak reporting [79] . According to the statement, control measures should be included in the paper. Future studies should consider following the ORION statement for reporting of outbreaks [79] , which would facilitate the formation of a body of evidence for outbreak management in LTCFs.",
