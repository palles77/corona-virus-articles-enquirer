            "text": "Background: Since August 2014, an increase in infections caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was reported in the USA and Canada, for the most part in children presenting with severe respiratory symptoms. Objectives: To determine whether an increase in severe EV-D68 respiratory infections was observed in our region. Study design: Samples from patients with respiratory symptoms were screened for viral pathogens, including rhinovirus and enterovirus. Subsequently, samples positive for rhinovirus and enterovirus were routinely sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, an additional method was used to detect EV-D68 specifically. Results: During the first three quarters of the year 2014, 1896 respiratory samples were analyzed; 39 (2%) of them tested positive for enterovirus. Eighteen samples tested positive for EV-D68, obtained from 16 different patients admitted to our hospital. Eleven were children below the age of 18, of whom five children needed intensive care treatment. The remaining five samples were from adults, who all had an underlying disease; three were transplant patients (heart, lung and renal transplantation), the other two had an underlying lung condition (COPD, asthma). Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with the strains circulating currently in the USA, all belonging to the known EV-D68 genetic subtypes. Conclusions: We observed an increase of EV-D68 infections in our population, both in children as well as in adult. In 2014 there have been 16 cases so far, compared to none in 2011 and 2013 and a single case in 2012. Phylogenetic analysis identified two similar clusters as shown in the USA and Canada.",

An outbreak of EV-D68 was shown to be the cause of the increased incidence of respiratory infections. Because EV-D68 was not detected by our routine respiratory panel at that time, we added an enterovirus PCR into our routine screening panel of 14 respiratory viruses (Influenza A, Influenza B, parainfluenzavirus 1-4, coronaviruses OC43, NL63 and 229E, adenovirus, bocavirus, RSV-A, RSV-B and human metapneumovirus). Moreover, we expanded our testing by routinely sequencing all enterovirus and rhinovirus strains to identify virus strains and to chart outbreaks and transmission patterns. Adding to this sequencing strategy, we included noroviruses as well as parechoviruses. Nationally, a structure called TYPENED was available through the Dutch National Institute of Health (RIVM) [3] . Furthermore, by using our regional sequencing and epidemiological strategy, called REGIOTYPE, we were able to speed up the flow of information from our region, including hospitals and Public Health Services covering the (not densely populated) Northern part of the Netherlands. The aim of this REGIOTYPE strategy is to provide a rapid sequencing http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.11.011 1386-6532/\u00a9 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This not only completes our diagnostics with sequencing data, but as clinical data are fed back into our database, we create a source of information which serves to obtain more insights in epidemiology patterns.",

The ECDC rapid risk assessment attributes the low level of reporting of EV-D68 to the low number of laboratories which routinely screen respiratory samples for EV-D68. Subsequently, only a small number of EV-D68 cases (11) are observed in the Netherlands during the enterovirus 'peak season' in 2014, through both the entero-surveillance and the ILI/ARI surveillance networks [5] . However, we are observing an increase in infections caused by EV-D68 in our tertiary care hospital since May 2014, similar to the outbreak in the USA and Canada. To improve the specific diagnostics for EV-68, we developed a specific real-time PCR method.",

After all, it seems unlikely that EV-D68 is causing problems only in the USA, Canada and the Northern part of Netherlands, without affecting other European regions. In the 2009-2010 upsurge, a number of children became severely ill. Moreover, it was then shown that 21% of the cases were hospital acquired, which highlights the need for testing of not only patients with severe respiratory disease, but also patients with mild symptoms, who may spread the virus. Similarly, in the current 2014 study, we possibly witnessed in-hospital transmission of EV-D68 from one severely ill child to two children who developed mild respiratory symptoms.",

Further epidemiological information is needed on a larger scale than currently available to determine the circulation for this virus. The implicit risk of focusing on a limited number of viruses for diagnostic purposes, or not performing virological diagnostics at all, is contestable. Patients with an underlying disease, whether children, transplant patients, or patient with a chronic respiratory condition, are not getting optimal care if the diagnostic options are limited or even absent. Therefore, a diagnostic stewardship program should be discussed asides antimicrobial stewardship and an infection control programs, which are currently being introduced in many hospitals [9] . We have documented upsurges of EV-D68 associated with sometimes severe morbidity twice in the last 5 years, i.e. in 2009/2010 and in 2014. It can be anticipated that the virus will reappear regularly and therefore diagnostic assays, whether LDTs or commercial assays, should be able to detect this virus. The EV-D68 specific assay we describe in this paper, may be used for this purpose.",

EV-D68 is associated with at times severe respiratory illness. Adequate surveillance for viruses like EV-D68 which can cause severe respiratory illnesses, is therefore desirable for University Medical Centers and Reference Centers. A collaborative approach effort between the diagnostic and reference laboratories could be taken to achieve this.
