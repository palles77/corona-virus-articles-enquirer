PKR inactivates the translation initiation factor eIF2a via phosphorylation, while OAS induces the endonuclease RNase L to degrade RNA. We show that poxvirus decapping enzymes D9 and D10, which remove caps from mRNAs, inhibit these antiviral responses by preventing dsRNA accumulation. Catalytic site mutations of D9 and D10, but not of either enzyme alone, halt vaccinia virus late protein synthesis and inhibit virus replication. Infection with the D9-D10 mutant was accompanied by massive mRNA reduction, cleavage of ribosomal RNA, and phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a that correlated with a 15-fold increase in dsRNA compared to wild-type virus. Additionally, mouse studies show extreme attenuation of the mutant virus. Thus, vaccinia virus decapping, in addition to targeting mRNAs for degradation, prevents dsRNA accumulation and anti-viral responses.",

            "text": "Poxviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate and transcribe their genomes and assemble infectious particles exclusively in the cytoplasm of cells (Moss, 2013) . Like eukaryotes, poxviruses encode enzymes that cap and methylate the 5 0 ends of mRNA (Barbosa and Moss, 1978; Martin et al., 1975; and add adenylate residues to the 3 0 ends (Gershon et al., 1991; Moss et al., 1973) as well as enzymes with nudix hydrolase motifs that specifically degrade methylated cap structures on RNAs . In fact, VACV, the prototype poxvirus, encodes two decapping enzymes, D9 and D10, with 25% predicted amino acid identity. Homologs of D10 are conserved in all poxviruses, and homologs of D9 are present in members of most vertebrate poxvirus genera (Upton et al., 2003) , suggesting their importance. Gene expression is sequentially regulated during VACV infection (Baldick and Moss, 1993; Yang et al., 2010) . Synthesis of the D9 decapping enzyme begins early in infection whereas D10 is only made following viral DNA replication, suggesting roles throughout the VACV cycle. Ribosome profiling indicated that D9 continues to be synthesized at late times (Z. Yang and B.M., unpublished data) . No evidence for interaction of D9 and D10 was obtained by affinity purification (S. Parrish and B.M., unpublished data). Decapping enzymes may accelerate degradation of cellular mRNA to minimize the host response to virus infection and reduce competition with viral mRNAs for the translation machinery. Shortening the half-life of viral mRNAs might also sharpen the division between the early, intermediate, and late phases of virus replication. Yet mutagenesis of D9 had no effect on VACV replication, and mutagenesis of D10 had a modest effect on enhancing the stability of cellular and viral mRNA and reducing virulence in a mouse infection model (Liu et al., 2014; Parrish and Moss, 2006) . Nevertheless, efforts to delete both D9 and D10 and propagate such mutants proved difficult, suggesting that they have an essential but redundant function (Parrish and Moss, 2006) .",

The double mutant, called vD9muD10mu, has a replication defect in customarily used human and monkey cell lines, which accounts for our initial inability to isolate the mutant. Synthesis of early mRNAs and proteins and genome replication occurred normally in non-permissive cells. However, subsequent to the onset of viral late transcription there was an abrupt decrease in the amount of late mRNAs and diminished late protein synthesis. These events were accompanied by cleavage of 28S and 18S rRNA, a signature of RNase L activation (Silverman et al., 1983) , and phosphorylation of protein kinase R (PKR), eIF2a, and IRF3. These findings suggested a role for dsRNA, which activates innate antiviral pathways and leads to inhibition of protein synthesis (Perdiguero and Esteban, 2009; Silverman, 2007; Stark et al., 1998) . Indeed, we found a large accumulation of dsRNA in cells infected with the double mutant. Since only the catalytic sites of D9 and D10 were inactivated, we concluded that an important role of decapping, in addition to enhancing decay of host and viral mRNAs, is to prevent dsRNA from forming or to accelerate its degradation.",

Point mutations in the nudix hydrolase motifs of D9 and D10, which were previously shown to completely inactivate decapping activity in vitro (Parrish and , were made. The VACV mutant vD9mu with catalytic site mutations in D9 and the double mutant vD9muD10mu were constructed by homologous recombination for the present study ( Figure 1A ). The VACV mutant vD10mu, with catalytic site mutations in D10 and the revertant vD10rev control virus, which has wild-type (WT) D9 and WT D10, were previously described (Liu et al., 2014) . Initial studies indicated that each of the viruses including vD9muD10mu replicated in baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells, and therefore these cells were used to prepare stocks of mutant and WT viruses.",

Viral proteins were analyzed to determine if impaired synthesis could account for the block in assembly of virions in cells infected with vD9muD10mu. BHK-21, MEF, HeLa, and BS-C-1 cells were mock infected or infected with the panel of mutant and WT viruses and lysates were prepared at 3, 7, 10, and 14 hr. In parallel, cells were infected in the presence of AraC and harvested at 14 hr. Viral proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting with antibody produced by rabbits repeatedly immunized with purified infectious VACV. For WT VACV, vD10rev, vD9mu, and vD10mu, the viral protein patterns were similar in each of the cell types (Figures 2A-2D ). The major bands at 7 hr and later times represent abundant post-replicative intermediate and late proteins. Several bands representing early proteins were seen in the 14 hr AraC samples, and faint corresponding bands were seen at 3 hr in some blots (Figures 2A-2D ). Protein patterns indistinguishable from those of the WT viruses were found in the blots of permissive BHK-21 and MEF cells infected with vD9muD10mu (Figures 2A and 2B ). However, in non-permissive HeLa and BS-C-1 cells infected with vD9muD10mu, the major bands representing post-replicative proteins were faint or undetected with the exception of a 38-kDa species (Figures 2C and 2D ). By contrast, the early proteins made in BS-C-1 and HeLa cells infected with vD9muD10mu in the presence of AraC were similar to those made by the WT virus. Thus, vD9muD10mu exhibited reduced post-replicative protein synthesis in non-permissive BS-C-1 and HeLa cells.",

I3 (Rochester and Traktman, 1998; Tseng et al., 1999) and E3 (Chang et al., 1992) are early proteins that bind single-stranded DNA and dsRNA, respectively.

Infected BS-C-1 cells stained for I3, A11, and DAPI are shown in Figure S2 ; staining of E3, A11, and DAPI is shown in Figure S3 . DAPI-staining viral factories, which normally vary in number, shape, size, and compactness, were present in cells infected with each of the viruses, indicating that vD9muD10mu was not impaired in viral DNA synthesis. The three viral proteins were mainly associated with the factories. However, whereas the two early proteins I3 and E3 were labeled to similar extents in the cells infected with vD10rev, vD10mu, and vD9muD10mu, there was less staining of the late A11 protein in cells infected with the latter mutant ( Figures S2  and S3 ).

Previous studies showed that during a synchronous infection, the steady state levels of early, intermediate and late VACV RNAs are determined by the onset of transcription as well as degradation (Baldick and Moss, 1993) . Total RNA from infected non-permissive BS-C-1 and permissive BHK-21 cells was resolved by electrophoresis on glyoxal gels and analyzed by northern blotting and autoradiography. DNA probes for the viral early transcript C11, the viral late transcript F17, and the cellular GAPDH RNA were prepared. The early C11 mRNA was detected at 3 hr, peaked at 6 hr, and then gradually declined at 9 and 12 hr in BHK-21 and BS-C-1 cells for all viruses ( Figure 4A ; Table S1 ). However, the decrease in C11 mRNA occurred more slowly in the cells infected with vD10mu and vD9muD10mu than with the WT-like vD10rev. A similar result with vD10mu and a D10 deletion mutant was reported previously and interpreted as RNA stabilization due to the absence of the D10 decapping enzyme (Liu et al., 2014; Parrish and Moss, 2006) . In the presence of AraC, which prevents synthesis of the D10 decapping enzyme and other post-replicative proteins, there was little change in the amount of the C11 mRNA between 3 and 12 hr ( Figure 4A ; Table S1 ).",

There was a higher amount of F17 mRNA in cells infected with vD10mu than vD10rev as previously reported (Liu et al., 2014) . For vD9muD10mu, the pattern was very different in permissive BHK-21 cells compared to non-permissive BS-C-1 cells. In BHK-21 cells infected with vD9muD10mu, F17 mRNA increased between 6 and 12 hr ( Figure 4B ; Table S1 ). In BS-C-1 cells infected with vD9muD10mu, the amount of F17 mRNA was similar to that of vD10rev and vD10mu at 6 hr, indicating that late transcription was not impaired.

Ethidium bromide staining of the glyoxal gels used for northern blotting demonstrated degradation of both the 28S and 18S rRNA subunits in non-permissive BS-C-1 cells that were infected with vD9muD10mu ( Figure 4D ). Degradation and specific cleavage products were detectable at 6 hr and progressed over time. There was massive rRNA degradation at 9 hr and 12 hr ( Figure 4D) , correlating with the diminution of viral late mRNA at those times in BS-C-1 cells infected by vD9muD10mu. Slight rRNA degradation was also noted in BS-C-1 cells infected with vD10mu at late times but not with vD10rev ( Figure 4D ). In contrast, no rRNA degradation was detected in permissive BHK-21 cells infected with any of the viruses. Furthermore, rRNA degradation did not occur in BS-C-1 cells infected in the presence of AraC ( Figure 4D ), indicating that the trigger for rRNA degradation occurred post-replicatively. mRNA and rRNA degradation and the accumulation of rRNA cleavage products are signatures of the activation of RNase L, a single-strand-specific endonuclease that is usually present in an inactive state (Silverman, 2007) . RNase L is activated by 2 0 5 0 -oligoadenylates (2-5A) synthesized by 2 0 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). OAS activity depends on interaction with dsRNA, which increases post-replicatively in cells infected with VACV as shown below.",

The shControl and shRNaseL cells were mock infected or infected with vD10rev, vD9muD10mu, or an E3 deletion mutant (vDE3L) for 14 hr in the presence or absence of AraC. The vDE3L was used as a positive control since the mutant is susceptible to RNase L activation (Xiang et al., 2002) . Cleavage of 28S and 18S RNA occurred in the A549 control cells infected with the three strains of VACV but was greatest in the vD9muD10mu and vDE3L mutants ( Figure S4B ). However, much less rRNA degradation occurred in the shRNaseL A549 cells ( Figure S4B ), confirming that the virus-induced degradation was RNaseL mediated. Nevertheless, the knockdown of RNase L was insufficient to confer replication of either vD9muD10mu or vDE3L (data not shown).",

The cells were stained with the dsRNA-specific J2 mAb; DAPI was used to visualize DNA in the nucleus and virus factories in the cyto-plasm. Nearly all cells infected with vD9muD10mu exhibited bright dsRNA-staining at 12 hr, which at higher magnification appeared to be associated with factories ( Figure 5A ). There were few bright dsRNA-staining cells infected with vD10mu, only occasional bright dsRNA-staining cells infected with vD9 or vD10rev, and only dim staining of uninfected cells ( Figure 5A ). Co-staining with antibody to the viral A11 protein was used to verify the completeness of the infections with vD10rev, vD10mu, and vD9muD10mu (not shown).",

Nevertheless, dsRNA is produced during replication of most RNA and DNA viruses. For dsDNA viruses, complementary RNA can arise by convergent transcription from opposite DNA strands and in the case of VACV is exacerbated by inefficient transcription termination at post-replicative times. Approximately 15% of the polyadenylated RNA synthesized at intermediate and late times of VACV replication can anneal to form long intermolecular duplexes with single-stranded tails, whereas very little complementary RNA is made at early times or when AraC inhibits viral DNA replication (Boone et al., 1979) . Hybridization studies indicated that the complementary sequence mapped to numerous genes along the genome (Boone et al., 1979) , which was confirmed recently by RNA-seq (Yang et al., 2010) . Some of the complementary RNA made at late times appears to exist in a double-stranded form when isolated directly from cells omitting phenol extraction (Colby and Duesberg, 1969) . Cytoplasmic sensors of dsRNA include PKR, OAS, RIG-1, MDA5, and NALP3, and more may await discovery (DeWitte-Orr and Mossman, 2010). Activation of these sensors generally leads to suppression of virus replication: PKR inhibits translation by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2a and has additional antiviral activities; OAS synthesizes 2-5A oligonucleotides that activate RNase L, which cleaves single stranded RNAs including mRNA and rRNA; RIG-1 and MDA5 recruit IPS-1 resulting in phosphorylation of IRF3 and induction of interferon and NALP-3 inducing inflammasome formation. Here we provide evidence that an important biological role of the VACV decapping enzymes is to prevent accumulation of dsRNA and the subsequent activation of antiviral responses.",

Inactivation of the D9 decapping enzyme had no effect on virus replication, and mutation of D10 had only a modest deleterious effect, whereas mutation of both drastically reduced replication in monkey and human cells and caused extreme attenuation in a murine respiratory infection model. The severe phenotype resulting from inactivation of both decapping enzymes indicated that they compensate for each other, consistent with their similar decapping activities in vitro Moss, 2006, 2007) . Since inactivation of D10 alone increased mRNA stability (Liu et al., 2014) , we had anticipated that inactivation of both decapping enzymes would increase stability even more. However, because our mutant still contains the E3 dsRNA binding protein, we did not anticipate that increased late complementary RNA would trigger a potent dsRNA response. Therefore, it was surprising to find drastic inhibition of protein synthesis and virtually complete loss of mRNA and intact rRNA in cells infected with the double mutant. Further studies revealed that this phenotype correlated with a huge increase in dsRNA, activation of RNase L, and phosphorylation of PKR, eIF2a, and IRF3. Very little dsRNA was present in BS-C-1 cells infected with WT revertant virus or the D9 mutant consistent with the absence of PKR phosphorylation and rRNA degradation. More dsRNA accumulated in cells infected with the D10 mutant, but this was still much less than with the double mutant, and PKR phosphorylation was delayed, and only slight degradation of rRNA was noted. The dsRNA evidently formed from viral RNA since: (i) dsRNA was not reliably detected in uninfected cells; (ii) dsRNA increased from 8 to 12 hr after infection with vD9muD10mu, which correlated with the time of synthesis of complementary viral mRNA during infection with VACV (Boone et al., 1979) ; (iii) AraC, which prevents synthesis of post-replicative viral complementary RNAs, prevented accumulation of dsRNA and rRNA breakdown mediated by RNase L activation; and (iv) dsRNA localized to virus factories, the site of viral intermediate and late transcription. Increased 2-5A, the product of OAS, was previously shown to increase during WT VACV infection, but rRNA cleavage was delayed (Rice et al., 1984) ; the kinetics of formation and inhibition by AraC led those authors to suggest that dsRNA derived from late complementary sequences was responsible. Activation of the RNase L pathway was previously described for a VACV temperature-sensitive A18 DNA helicase mutant, which was attributed to increased dsRNA resulting from failure to control the length of late transcripts Condit, 1993, 1995; Condit, 1994, 1995) . Some increased dsRNA has also been reported for a K1L deletion mutant, although the mechanism remains to be determined (Willis et al., 2011) .",

Although VACV does not appear to encode a RNA 5 0 exonuclease, a human genomewide siRNA screen indicated the importance of Xrn1, the major cytoplasmic RNA 5 0 exonuclease, for VACV replication and spread (Sivan et al., 2013) . Moreover, in the accompanying report Burgess and Mohr (2015) confirm the inhibition of VACV replication by Xrn1 knockdown and further demonstrate the accumulation of dsRNA and phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a. Thus it is likely that D9 and D10 act coordinately with Xrn1 to mediate mRNA decay and prevent accumulation of dsRNA. However, whether these activities reduce the annealing of complementary RNA or degrade dsRNA remains to be determined. With regard to the latter, there is evidence that Xrn1 associates with other proteins including a helicase that could help unwind dsRNA and allow degradation (Jones et al., 2012) . Xrn1 also associates with the cytoplasmic DCP1/DCP2 decapping complex, but evidently, the host enzymes are unable to compensate for loss of D9 and D10 during VACV infection. BALB/c mice in groups of five were infected intranasally with 10 5 or 10 6 PFU of WT VACV, vD10rev, vD10mu, vD9mu, or vD9muD10mu . The mice were weighed daily and euthanized if their weight dropped by 30%. Asterisks indicate day of death or euthanasia of individual mice. Bars indicate SEM. (B) Organ titers. BALB/c mice in groups of four were infected intransally with 10 5 or 10 6 PFU of vD10mu or vD9muD10mu or 10 5 PFU vD10rev or vD9mu. On the days indicated, the turbinates and lungs of individual mice were homogenized and the virus titers determined by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. Bars indicate SEM.",

            "text": "Poxviruses encode several early proteins that prevent the cell from recognizing or responding to dsRNA. The E3 protein encoded by VACV binds and sequesters dsRNA (Chang and Jacobs, 1993; Chang et al., 1992) , and the K3 protein inhibits eIF2a phosphorylation by PKR (Carroll et al., 1993; Davies et al., 1992) . The K1 protein has recently been reported to reduce the amount of dsRNA (Willis et al., 2011) . We demonstrated that E3 was expressed in cells infected with vD9muD10mu, but apparently the protein was overwhelmed by the huge amounts of dsRNA that accumulated in the absence of the viral decapping enzymes. Although the mechanism by which binding of E3 to dsRNA prevents activation of the innate immune pathways is not known, stoichiometric amounts are presumably needed. Therefore, the phenotype of vD9muD10mu might be reversed by greatly overexpressing E3 before dsRNA accumulates. We have moderately overexpressed E3 by transfection, but only a slight increase in viral protein synthesis and plaque size was observed (R.L., unpublished data). Further efforts will be made to more highly overexpress E3.",

            "text": "It makes sense that the host range restriction of the VACV decapping mutant is similar to that previously described for a deletion mutant of the E3 dsRNA binding protein (i.e., chick embryo fibroblasts, rabbit kidney-13, and hamster BHK-21 cells are permissive, and African green monkey cells and human HeLa cells are non-permissive) (Beattie et al., 1996; Langland and Jacobs, 2002; Xiang et al., 2002) . In future experiments, we will address the question of how certain cells can support replication of the VACV double decapping enzyme mutant without causing degradation of RNA or inhibition of viral protein synthesis. Susceptibility may be related to the endogenous levels of dsRNA sensors, since activation of antiviral pathways depends on their levels in addition to dsRNA. For example, cells with lower levels of OAS are more resistant to dsRNA (Stark et al., 1979; Zhao et al., 2013) . On the other hand, mouse macrophages have high levels of OAS (Zhao et al., 2013) , and this may contribute to the severe attenuation of vD9muD10mu seen after intranasal infection of mice compared to MEFs. In addition, since OAS and PKR are interferon inducible, interferons could also contribute to attenuation in mice, while the replication of vD9muD10mu was not impaired in MEF cells. We plan to further study the relationship between specific dsRNA sensors and host restriction of vD9muD10mu in cells and animals.",
