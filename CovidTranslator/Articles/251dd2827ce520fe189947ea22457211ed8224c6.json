However, only a few studies on the B-cell activation mechanism after FIP virus (FIPV) infection have been reported. The present study shows that: (1) the ratio of peripheral blood sIg ? CD21 -B-cells was higher in cats with FIP than in SPF cats, (2) the albumin-to-globulin ratio has negative correlation with the ratio of peripheral blood sIg ? CD21 -B-cell, (3) cells strongly expressing mRNA of the plasma cell master gene, B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1), were increased in peripheral blood in cats with FIP, (4) mRNA expression of B-cell differentiation/survival factors, IL-6, CD40 ligand, and B-cell-activating factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF), was enhanced in macrophages in cats with FIP, and (5) mRNAs of these B-cell differentiation/survival factors were overexpressed in antibodydependent enhancement (ADE)-induced macrophages. These data suggest that virus-infected macrophages overproduce B-cell differentiation/survival factors, and these factors act on B-cells and promote B-cell differentiation into plasma cells in FIPV-infected cats.",

FCoV is classified into two biotypes based on differences in pathogenicity: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats. In contrast, FIPV infection causes a fatal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The difference in pathogenicity between FECV and FIPV in cats is considered to be associated with macrophage tropism of the viruses [27, 29] . It has been proposed that FIPV arises from FECV by mutation [11, 26, 37] , but the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified.",

A similar phenomenon has been observed with other virus infections, such as dengue and human immunodeficiency virus infections [10, 33, 35] . ADE of FIPV infection has been reported to be induced by antibodies against FIPV spike (S) protein [5, 12, 23] . In ADE-induced macrophages (ADE macrophages), TNF-alpha production increases with viral replication, and this TNF-alpha acts on macrophages and promotes virus receptor (feline aminopeptidase N; fAPN) expression [31] .",

We reported previously that when the FIPV antigen was detected by the fluorescent antibody method, 10-20% of cells were positive when SPF cat-derived alveolar macrophages were inoculated with FIPV ? anti-FIPV S MAb, whereas 1-2% of cells were positive when alveolar macrophages were inoculated with FIPV [12, 15] . It seems that the increased number of virus-infected macrophages leads to the over-expression of B-cell differentiation/survival factor mRNA in macrophages. However, there is no evidence that this hypothesis is correct. A continued examination of the mechanism of ADE activity in FIPV infection would strengthen this hypothesis.",

The increased IL-6, CD40L, and BAFF mRNA expression levels in ADE macrophages may also be closely involved in aggravation of pathogenesis, as well as TNF-alpha. That is, our data suggest that FIPV re-infection induces ADE and advances FIP development in cats. However, Addie et al. [2] reported that FCoV re-infection of anti-FCoV antibody-positive domestic cats might not result in the development of ADE. Although the details are unclear, differences in the immunological condition of FCoVinfected cats may be the reason why the phenomenon noted in ADE does not occur in domestic cats. It is necessary to analyze mechanism of ADE in detail.",

Similarly, increased levels of immune-complexes in the blood of mice induced to overexpress BAFF have been reported [21] . Therefore, it is easily predicted that IL-6, CD40L, and BAFF are involved in the development of immune-complex-mediated vasculitis. IL-6 has also been reported to induce Blimp-1 expression in B-cells, mainly by activating STAT3 [19] , suggesting that IL-6 is involved in the enhanced Blimp-1 mRNA expression in PBMCs in FIP cats.",

CD21 -B-cell ratio gradually increased with time following FIPV infection. sIg ? CD21 ? B-cells mostly disappeared at the onset of FIP (30 days after FIPV infection), whereas the ratio of sIg ? CD21 -B-cells was markedly increased.Correlation between the albumin-to-globulin ratio and the ratio of sIg ? CD21 -B-cells By correlation analysis, the albumin-to-globulin ratio showed a negative correlation with the ratio of sIg ? CD21 -B-cells in PBMCs of eight SPF cats and eight FIP cats (r = -0.623, P \\ 0.01). A linear correlation between the albumin-to-globulin ratio and the ratio of sIg ? CD21 -Bcells is shown inFig. 2.Partial base sequence analysis of Blimp-1 cDNA, deduction of amino acid sequence, and comparison with other animal species Tedder et al.[34] reported that CD21 molecules disappeared when B-cells differentiated into antibody-producing cells. Based on this concept, the increased sIg ? CD21 -Bcells in PBMC in FIP cats may have been differentiated antibody-producing cells (plasma cells). Thus, we attempted to measure the mRNA expression level of the plasma Emergence of sIg ? CD21 -B-cells after FIPV infection and their counts and ratio in PBMCs: PBMCs were isolated from SPF and FIP cats, and B-cell surface antigens (sIg and CD21 molecules) were analyzed by flow cytometry.a The counts of sIg ?

Since the base sequence of feline Blimp-1 mRNA has not yet been determined, we partially identified the cDNA base sequence of feline Blimp-1 mRNA.The nucleotide sequences of mouse (GenBank accession number: MMU08185), human (NM_ 182907), bovine (XM_ 618588), and canine (XM_539068) Blimp-1 mRNA have been determined.

The cells and culture supernatant were collected every 24 h thereafter. Intracellular FIPV negative-strand RNA was measured by RT-PCR (a), and the virus titer in the culture supernatant was measured by the plaque method (b). The intracellular IL-6, CD40L, and BAFF mRNA expression levels were also measured by RT-PCR (c). IL-6, CD40L, and BAFF mRNA were quantitatively analyzed in terms of their relative density compared to that of the mRNA for the housekeeping gene GAPDH (n = 8).
