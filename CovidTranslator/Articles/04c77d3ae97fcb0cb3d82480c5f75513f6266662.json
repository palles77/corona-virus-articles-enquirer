            "text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease, also known as infectious tracheobronchitis or kennel cough, is considered 1 of the most common infectious diseases in dogs worldwide. 4 It is highly contagious and affects the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and nasal mucosa, causing acute respiratory signs, mainly cough, which usually are selflimiting. 4 Because of the contagious nature of CIRD, it is most prevalent in dense dog populations such as in kennels and rehoming centers. 4 Canine infectious respiratory disease has a multifactorial etiology, and several respiratory viruses as well as bacterial pathogens have been shown to contribute to the disease complex. [4] [5] [6] Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) and canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) were first detected in dogs with contagious tracheobronchitis in the 1960s, and since then these viruses have been considered as the principal etiologic agents in CIRD. [7] [8] [9] [10] Canine herpes virus (CHV) also was detected in dogs with respiratory signs decades ago, but its role in CIRD remains controversial. [11] [12] [13] [14] In addition to these pathogens, novel respiratory viruses recently have been reported. Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) was first identified in 2003 in dogs at a rehoming center in the United Kingdom. 15 Subsequently, evidence of contagious tracheobronchitis caused by CRCoV has been reported worldwide. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Canine influenza virus (CIV) was first described in a racing Greyhound population in [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Although not considered part of the CIRD complex, canine distemper virus (CDV) is an important respiratory pathogen causing severe systemic disease characterized by a variety of clinical signs, including respiratory signs. 33 Viral-bacterial co-infections in the respiratory tract are well documented in humans with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and epidemiologic data as well as laboratory studies support the conclusion that respiratory viruses predispose to the development of secondary bacterial infections. 34, 35 Several mechanisms have been shown to contribute to this situation: Viruses destroy the respiratory epithelium and facilitate bacterial adhesion, viral infection up-regulates expression of molecules that bacteria utilize as receptors, and virus-induced immunosuppression promotes secondary bacterial infection. 35, 36 Recent advances in molecular diagnostic techniques have greatly increased understanding of the etiology of CAP in humans. Viruses affecting the lower respiratory tract currently are recognized as causative and complicating factors in up to 40% of humans with CAP. [37] [38] [39] Preceding or concurrent infections with CIRD viruses also have been considered as a possible etiological factor in dogs with BP, although there currently are only isolated reports suggesting this connection. 1, 40, 41 In dogs, BP most often is caused by opportunistic bacteria that belong to the normal oral flora. 42, 43 However, published studies on viral-bacterial co-infections in dogs almost exclusively describe dogs housed in dense populations, such as kennels or rehoming centers, that are infected with respiratory viruses and bacteria belonging to the CIRD complex. 6, 7, 44 Nevertheless, it is likely that respiratory viruses also are an important etiologic factor in dogs with BP caused by opportunistic bacteria in a similar manner as has been reported in humans.",

Although BP was described in Dogs decades ago, information on the mechanisms leading to the development of the disease still is limited. Factors such as diseases predisposing to aspiration, immunodeficiency, or ciliary dysfunction that lead to impairment of pulmonary defense mechanisms and thereby predispose to the development of BP have been described. 3 However, the role of preceding or concurrent infections with CIRD viruses has not been fully evaluated in dogs with BP, although it has been suspected to play a role in the etiology, as reported in humans with CAP. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Previously, respiratory viral-bacterial co-infections mostly have been reported in dogs housed in dense populations, such as kennels and rescue shelters, and bacteria accompanying viruses have been primary CIRD bacteria (B. bronchiseptica, S. equi sp. zooepidemicus, and Mycoplasma spp.). 6, 7, 19, 44 Our study indicates that respiratory viruses, primarily CPIV, frequently are also found in dogs with BP, which is caused by opportunistic bacteria. Therefore, it is likely that CIRD viruses can predispose dogs to opportunistic bacterial lung infections by increasing bacterial adhesion, as has been reported in humans. 35 In this study, CPIV was the most common viral pathogen detected, which is in accordance with previous reports describing viruses responsible for CIRD in different countries. 6, 13, 19 Novel CRCoV was detected in 1 dog with BP, further demonstrating that CRCoV has a worldwide distribution and also may be detected in Northern Europe.",

In a longitudinal study on respiratory viruses in a rehoming center in England, CPIV was commonly detected despite regular vaccinations, but CDV and CAV-2 were not encountered, most likely because of adequate vaccination coverage. 13 It remains unknown whether more efficient CPIV vaccines and possible CRCoV vaccinations could decrease the incidence of BP, as has been shown in humans, in whom protection against influenza and respiratory syncytial virus decreased the incidence of secondary bacterial infections. [50] [51] [52] Nosocomial infections with respiratory viruses also have been reported in dogs. An outbreak of CPIV was described in an animal hospital and an outbreak of CHV was reported in immunocompromised dogs. 53, 54 Because co-infections with CIRD viruses are shown to be common in dogs with BP, the infection risk needs to be taken into account when treating BP patients in the same premises (eg, intensive care units) with immunocompromised patients.",

This finding might be influenced by the structure of the virus-negative group: All 4 dogs with another predisposing factor for the development of BP were <20 kg (West Highland White Terrier, Dachshund, Spanish Water Dog, and Schnauzer). Dogs with viral co-infections also were younger than those without viral co-infection, although this did not reach statistical significance. This finding is not unexpected, because young animals might have insufficient acquired immunity against CIRD viruses. 2 Clinical findings, arterial blood gas analysis, and hematology, as well as respiratory sample cytology in both groups were in accordance with previously reported findings in BP and did not differ between virus-negative and virus-positive groups. 42, 43, 48 On thoracic radiographs, an alveolar pattern in the cranial and the middle lobes was predominant in both groups without group predisposition. Radiographic findings in dogs with BP have been thoroughly reported previously for cases of aspiration etiology. 55, 56 In our study, radiographic findings in dogs with BP caused by other etiologies were similar to those reported for aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration etiology was considered unlikely, because none of the dogs with BP had a history of vomiting, regurgitation, recent anesthesia or signs compatible with laryngeal paralysis. Our findings could indicate that an alveolar pattern in cranial and middle lung lobes may be typical for pneumonia, regardless of etiology. On the other hand, aspiration pneumonia might have played a role in some dogs but could not be confirmed or denied based on available history, examination findings, or imaging. We were unable to identify clinical variables to reliably distinguish dogs with BP and viral co-infection, and PCR testing therefore appears to be required to identify viral respiratory infections in dogs with BP. A similar finding was reported in humans. 57 There were no significant differences in the duration of hospitalization (P = .427) or partial pressures of arterial oxygen at presentation (P = .343) between BP dogs with and without viral co-infection, indicating that viral co-infections do not appear to cause a more severe course of BP. In dogs, limited information is available on the severity of BP of different etiological origins, and in humans the reports are contradictory. Some studies have shown that mixed infections with viruses and bacteria induce a more severe clinical disease, whereas others have been unable to demonstrate significant differences in disease severity. 49, [58] [59] [60] [61] Previous studies reporting microbiological findings in dogs with pneumonia have found growth of a single species of bacteria in 40-74% of cases. 42, 43 All of these studies used TTW as a sampling method. Factors that might have influenced the finding of primarily a single species of bacteria in our study may be the use of BAL as a sampling method in majority of cases, compared to previous studies where TTW was used and the widespread use of prior antimicrobial treatments in these dogs.",

Lower respiratory tract samples are considered ideal when diagnosing viral respiratory infections in humans with CAP, and it has been shown that virus-positive PCR in BALF is associated with respiratory symptoms in humans. 62, 63 Naturally, the invasiveness of retrieving BALF, compared to upper respiratory sampling, limits the usefulness of this accurate sample. However, especially when using molecular methods, virus recovery from the upper respiratory tract may be suggestive of virus exposure rather than indicative of an active viral infection. 6 We chose lower respiratory tract samples in order to decrease the number of false-positive results, but a comparison of PCR findings between upper and lower respiratory tract samples would be useful. Underestimation of virus-positive PCR results may have occurred in our dogs in cases in which viral infection preceded BP and sampling was performed outside of the viral shedding period.",

Additionally, Mycoplasma PCR was positive in 3 dogs with negative culture results. The clinical relevance of these positive results is difficult to interpret, because Mycoplasma spp. are also encountered in the respiratory tract of healthy dogs. 64 On the other hand, because Mycoplasma requires special culture methods (and in this study also shipping to an outside laboratory), there might have been dogs in which Mycoplasma culture was falsely negative. Quantitative PCR might have aided in assessing the clinical relevance of these PCR findings.",

BAL was used as a sampling method in all dogs with BBTB. Results from cytology analysis of BALF and TTW fluid in BP dogs are presented in Table 3. Because BALF and TTW fluid cytology did not differ significantly in other variables aside from the percentage of epithelial cells (median in BALF, 0.0; interquartile range, 0.0-0.0 versus median in TTW fluid, 0.7; interquartile range, 0.0-14.7; P = .008), combined results are represented for the 2 sampling techniques. Altogether, 11/20 dogs with BP had received antimicrobials before sampling. Significant bacterial growth (\u226510 3 colony-forming units/mL in BALF or TTW fluid) was identified in the primary culture in 11/20 samples (5/11 dogs with prior antimicrobial treatment).
