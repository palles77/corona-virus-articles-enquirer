            "text": "The maintenance of health relies on protein maturation, activation, and breakdown, involving the controlled and coordinated actions of proteases. A subset of these enzymes (the cysteinyl cathepsins) was characterized originally as lysosomal in location and function (1) . Later work uncovered additional roles in extracellular spaces as well as in the cytosol and nuclei, revealing that cathepsins are not limited to the unspecific destruction of proteins delivered to lysosomes (2) . Rather, some cathepsins process specific substrates important to activities such as antigen presentation, collagen turnover in bone and cartilage, neuropeptide and hormone processing, and leukocyte penetration of the extracellular matrix and cellular monolayers (1, (3) (4) (5) . The loss of activity among specific cathepsins in mice or humans produces a variety of phenotypes (1, 2, 6) . The widely expressed cysteine protease cathepsin L (Ctsl) is implicated in several types of pathology, and is a proposed target for therapeutic inhibition to control inflammatory and immune responses (5, 7, 8) . For example, by cleaving fusion proteins, Ctsl helps Ebola, Hendra, and severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses to enter cells, thereby advancing these infections (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, little is known of Ctsl's importance in defense against bacterial infections.",

At 14 days, blood-vessel caliber was significantly greater in both groups of infected mice than in sham-infected control mice, reflecting vascular enlargement by the conversion of capillaries to venules after infection ( Figure 6 ). The amount of blood-vessel remodeling was similar in Ctsl 1/1 and Ctsl 2/2 mice (P \u00bc 0.15). The change in blood vessels is consistent with previous observations of C57BL/6 mice after M. pulmonis infection (23) (24) (25) . By comparison, changes in tracheal lymphatics after infection were strikingly different in Ctsl 1/1 and Ctsl 2/2 mice ( Figure 6 ). Lymphatics in the mucosa over the cartilaginous rings of Ctsl 1/1 mice were 10.2-fold more abundant at 14 days of infection than in pathogen-free control mice, but the difference was only 5-fold in Ctsl 2/2 mice. A comparison of lymphatic growth in Ctsl 1/1 and Ctsl 2/2 mice at 14 days of infection revealed a 2.9-fold greater lymphangiogenesis in Ctsl 1/1 mice ( Figure 6 ). Values for the two groups of corresponding sham-infected mice were not significantly different. These data reflect 69.1% less lymphangiogenesis in Ctsl 2/2 mice after infection, without a reduction in amount of blood-vessel remodeling.",

We attribute the higher mortality among infected Ctsl-deficient mice to more severe bronchitis and pneumonia during the early phase of infection. On an absolute scale, the amount of obliteration by inflammatory cells and proteinaceous fluid of lung surface area available for gas transfer was very high in infected Ctsl 2/2 mice. Although the pneumonia grade seemed to plateau or even diminish in Ctsl 2/2 mice at 14 days of infection, this may be a survivor effect, because several of the most severely affected mice died before that time point. Nonetheless, pulmonary infection by M. pulmonis may be survivable in Ctsl 2/2 mice living beyond the initial phase of infection, as it was in all wild-type mice receiving the same initial inoculum of M. pulmonis.",

Defective lymphangiogenesis in Ctsl 2/2 mice after infection is consistent with the involvement of Ctsl in growing lymphatic endothelial cells. However, in the absence of inflammation, Ctsl is not essential in this regard, because tracheal lymphatics and blood vessels were indistinguishable in pathogen-free Ctsl 1/1 and Ctsl 2/2 mice. Alternately, reduced lymphatic growth could have been a consequence of an ineffective host immune response, which is essential for the full expression of vascular remodeling after mycoplasmal infection (25) . Reduced lymphangiogenesis itself could impair host defense later after infection, given that lymphatics are essential conduits for the trafficking of immune cells and proteins. Blunted lymphangiogenesis could increase mucosal edema and other manifestations of inflammation (26) .",

In cancer studies, cathepsin activity localized to areas of tumors, and was possibly attributable to production by immune cells participating in an antitumor response (33) . In the present experiments, the inflammatory response was greater in Ctsl 2/2 mice, as detected by histology and local TNF-a and chemokine production, but this response was less effective, as reflected by an increase in mycoplasmal burden. This disconnection suggests that Ctsl is necessary to initiate a response, but that the response is dysregulated without Ctsl. Given the evidence that Ctsl can facilitate apoptosis in macrophages and neutrophils (34) , the finding of increased inflammation and neutrophilic infiltrates could relate in part to dysregulated apoptosis and delayed cell death.",

Because Ctsl is reported to play a role in MHC Class II-dependent immune responses (29) , we hypothesized that Ctsl would be required for normal humoral responses to mycoplasma antigens. We evaluated the contribution of Ctsl to adaptive immune responses by comparing pathogen-specific, Ig class-specific, and Ig subclass-specific responses to live and heat-killed M. pulmonis in Ctsl 2/2 and Ctsl 1/1 mice. Titers of mycoplasma-specific Ig were statistically indistinguishable in the serum of Ctsl 2/2 and Ctsl 1/1 mice after 3 and 7 days of infection, even though measured titers of live mycoplasma in lung extracts were higher in Ctsl 2/2 mice than in Ctsl 1/1 mice at these time points. This might suggest a deficit of antibody production relative to antigen burden. Nonetheless, the similar responses to an injection of heat-killed mycoplasma, which ensured the delivery of equal burdens of antigen, suggest that the capacity of Ctsl 2/2 mice to mount a humoral response was largely intact for mycoplasma antigens, and extended to all major Ig classes and IgG subclasses.

Primary systemic immune responses typically reflect local responses and often take 7-10 days to develop, so the similar concentrations of IFN-g at 3 days between Ctsl 2/2 and wild-type mice with and without infection do not necessarily reflect cellular immune responses. It remains unclear whether this liability in cellular immunity resulted from an MHC Class I-specific defect in antigen processing or an alteration in the peptide repertoire of MHC Class II cells, although Ctsl to date has been implicated more strongly in MHC Class II-restricted antigen presentation (7, 29) . Alternately, impaired thymic development in these animals could affect the long-term ability to generate T-lymphocyte responses. Figure 6 .

            "text": "As already noted, we found Ctsl deficiency to be accompanied by impaired lymphangiogenesis, but not blood-vessel remodeling, after mycoplasmal infection. To our knowledge, this is the first time that blunted airway lymphangiogenesis has been found without an associated reduction in blood-vessel remodeling, although the reverse has also been found (26, 35) . Similarly, the persistence of remodeled airway lymphatics has been found after remodeled blood vessels regressed, subsequent to treatment of the airway infection (26, 28, 36) .Proteases are important for new vessel formation because sprouting endothelial cells penetrate the extracellular matrix, which consists of laminin, fibronectin, collagens, and other large proteins. In an elastase perfusion model of abdominal aortic aneurysm, Ctsl 2/2 mice had impaired angiogenesis, with reduced numbers of microvessels and defects of microvessels sprouting from aortic rings (30) . Furthermore, Ctsl in cells of bone marrow origin is reported to be necessary for retinal and choroidal vessel development in models of intraocular neovascularization (37) . Thus, the finding in the present experiments that a lack of Ctsl neither prevents nor reduces mycoplasma-induced tracheal blood-vessel remodeling was contrary to our initial expectations. However, most of this remodeling is circumferential vessel enlargement with transformation from a capillary to a venule phenotype, rather than angiogenesis. Therefore, Ctsl could be more important for growing new vessels than for the remodeling of existing ones.Infected Ctsl 2/2 mice demonstrated much less lymphangiogenesis than Ctsl 1/1 mice, even though inflammation was at least as severe as in Ctsl 2/2 mice. This relative defect in lymphangiogenesis may be attributable to a loss of the effect by Ctsl on lymphatic endothelial cell growth, migration, and matrix penetration, or could result from a dysregulated immune response, upon which lymphatic growth is dependent (25) .In conclusion, these results suggest a critical role for Ctsl in containing airway mycoplasma infection and the resultant lymphangiogenesis. Although Ctsl-null mice mounted robust humoral responses to mycoplasma antigen, the inability of splenocytes from infected Ctsl 2/2 mice to produce IFN-g in response to mycoplasma antigen suggests a possible defect in cell-mediated immune responses (38) . In the context of M. pulmonis infection, in which activated macrophages are thought to play an important and possibly critical role in controlling infection (13, 16, 39) , a deficit of the antigen-stimulated production of IFN-g, which is a macrophageactivation factor (38) , could blunt macrophage responses to mycoplasma. Our experiments predict that Ctsl inhibitors could have the unintended consequence of increasing the severity of respiratory mycoplasmal infection, a possibility that should be assessed in developing and applying Ctsl inhibitors to a clinical context.Author disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
