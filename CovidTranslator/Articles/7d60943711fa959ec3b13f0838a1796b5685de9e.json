Given its significant role, business integration in general has been an enduring research topic over the years. However, due to its complex nature, the ways to achieve this important organisational capability in firms are still not clearly understood. Hence, the present study is an attempt to 'open this black box' and examine the relevant issues through a case study of M.com, one of the largest e-commerce firms in China. The findings of this case study emphasise that the ability to coordinate organisational interdependencies and asset orchestration according to the needs of business processes is challenging but necessary in order to achieve business integration in e-commerce firms. It is found that asset orchestration in a firm is contingent on the organisational interdependencies such that different interdependence types demand different coordination methods at the very least. It also shows the significant role of IT in asset orchestration and the coordination of organisational interdependencies during business integration. With these capabilities, firms can experience growth and improve the quality of conformance to customer needs.",

This requires tight coordination among discrete business activities which ultimately enables the firm to respond to pressing competitive forces (Markus, 2000) . As an industry moves toward real-time supply chains, the integration of external and internal business activities at both the front end (marketing and sales, customer services, outbound logistics) and the back end (operations, technology development, procurement) becomes critical. Interdependencies between front-end and back-end offices, that is, the extent to which organisational units depend upon each other for resources due to information complexity and resource scarcity, is an important capability needed for firms to achieve business integration. Effective organisational interdependencies ensure the appropriate configurations of firm processes and assets, and increase a firm's capacity to respond quickly and effectively to market forces (Rockart & Short, 1989) .",

Driven by the increasing popularity of e-commerce and the dramatic increase in the amount of economic activity generated through it, China's ecommerce firms are locked in severe competition. The ability of firms and their underlying IT systems to work together (interoperate) seamlessly across a supply chain at the business and process level is important. This places more scrutiny on the system and business integration strategies adopted by these firms. The new economy provides a unique context for research on business integration in e-commerce firms, which in turn will offer valuable feedback to firms striving to survive and thrive in such competitive environments.",

However, according to management theories, different types of organisational interdependencies across a firm will shape the structure of the firm and its internal cooperation differently (G\u00f6z\u00fcb\u00fcy\u00fck, 2013) . In turn, the complexities of firm structure processes and cooperation are critical determinants of business integration. Hence, business integration and organisational interdependencies are tightly coupled. To date, many studies have posited the important antecedents for business integration and organisational interdependencies. Yet, despite the growing body of research on organisational interdependencies, the way in which these interdependencies are tied to business integration remains unanswered. Organisational interdependencies are complex and multifaceted phenomena embedded within a firm's context. Given the role of organisational interdependencies in contemporary business environments, it is imperative to investigate how to coordinate and support organisational interdependencies in order to achieve business integration.",

            "text": "The objective of this case study is to examine approaches to supporting organisational interdependencies to achieve business integration. Specifically, we use the literature on asset orchestration (Teece, 2009) to examine the phenomenon. Asset orchestration involves the managerial search, selection and configuration of resources and capabilities, and requires the ability to match resource investment decisions with congruent deployment decisions. Every organisation faces resource constraints, so resources tend to be allocated where they are needed most. Optimal asset orchestration reduces the uncertainty that will incur higher costs. For example, it is likely that firms that are uncertain about the state of their environment will spend a greater amount of time and resources on environmental scanning and forecasting. The deployment of IT systems also plays an important role by, for example, reducing the risk of loss of resource control. Hence, asset orchestration in organisations provides an important perspective to understand the management of organisational interdependencies in turbulent environments due to information complexity and resource scarcity. Our case study examines the unique composition of IT capabilities and asset orchestration required to achieve e-commerce front and back office integration. In the following sections, the case firm is described. The focal processes in the case firm are then discussed. The lessons learned are then highlighted, followed by the conclusion.",

The foundation of M.com dates back to 1998 when the firm was operating as a retailer. By the late 2000s, M.com had developed a reputation for being the de-facto '3C' (computer, communication and consumer electronic) online retailer. In a little under ten years, M.com pushed through to become one of China's most comprehensive and influential B2C platforms in terms of products, visits, click-through rates, sales and industry reputation. Its closest rivals are Suning and Amazon, according to an independent market research firm, Analysys International. Today, M.com offers approximately 31.3 million stock-keeping units across 13 categories of products including computers, mobile phones, home appliances, cosmetics, luxury goods, and childcare products.

At the time of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic in 2003, falling consumer confidence forced sales across its retail stores to plunge. The firm was faced with the decision to close all of the retail stores and risk changing its mode of operation from physical storefront to online. In late 2003, the CEO led a group of IT experts to develop a system to support the executive decision to transform to an online store. The online site was launched in 2004. Over the next three years, the business thrived; M.com began offering an extended range of products and services to an expanded customer base including raw material manufacturers, agents, distributors, retailers, stores and other online shops.

Scepticism towards technical development issues and the robustness of the web technology grew among the managers attempting to leverage these technologies.

According to the CEO, buying goods on the internet had not been popular ten to twelve years earlier in China; but, as Taobao 1 and other platforms grew, people started to see the potential and promise of B2C. Another factor was the continuous creation and improvement of management functions and practices, which enabled the transformation of the firm. As well as relying on external allies and suppliers to speed up their movement to the web, M.com started rebuilding its technological infrastructure and increased efforts in internal business integration-related activities. One initiative reflecting the improvements made was the 211 Program whereby M.com guaranteed the delivery time for any order received by the morning deadline (11:00 am) and the evening deadline (11:00 pm). To fulfil the 211 Program guarantee, the firm improved many processes, particularly its focal processes of strategic planning and reporting, order processing, and product design and development. This required not just a fully optimised web interface, but also the support of a large-scale web content repository to enable its entire supply chain.

On the other hand, monitoring the sales of the products, finding innovative means to market the products and repositioning goods into new product lines where necessary are handled by product managers from the product management department. Hence, product managers create an important source of work for developers and product managers need developers in order to maintain their product lines.

            "text": "Firstly, it is found that asset orchestration in a firm is contingent on the organisational interdependencies that arise from joint tasks between collaborating sides. This is consistent with previous findings showing that different interdependence types demand different coordination methods in terms of rules and operating procedures, adaptive planning and scheduling, and mutual adjustments. The case study shows that, for all three processes, the coordination mechanisms implemented by management to satisfy or fully contain the contingencies in interdependent relationships within a firm are different. For example, the process of pooling data from interdependent sides for forecasting and strategic planning requires the adoption of standards, the establishment of regulations and the observance of strict routines in order to overcome uncertainty. On the other hand, when there is recognition that common pool resources are finite or when resource uncertainty surfaces under such conditions, information requirements begin to outstrip the formal control systems. In the context of product development and management, this may involve actively promoting competition whereby previously competitive entities cooperate to manage the scarce resources and create a synergistic and strategically advantageous environment. Our case study shows that the challenge for interdependent sides is identifying how they will respond and adapt not only to the activities but also to the resources available to one another.",

            "text": "Secondly, this case informs us about the role of IT capabilities in achieving business integration. When order processing becomes more complicated due to customer cancellations and amendments, a firm must quickly move from maintaining a web presence to managing order processing transactions end-to-end online. With narrower business functions and specialisation, such that the ERP and ordering system become critical resources for integrating business functions, the distance between the functions conducted by each office reduces. The rapid expansion of the business and the growing transaction volume will also heighten the perception that the IT department plays a supporting role rather than the perception that it leads organisational changes. However, the growth and performance of a firm cannot be totally relegated to IT mechanisms during firm transformations. IT-motivated improvements also involve the capacity for de-stabilising old sources of competitive advantage and dismantling out-moded capabilities and endowments. Our case study shows that the decoupling of the IS department into front-end and back-end offices ultimately led to better delivery. Optimisation within each functional office is the solution to counter overall process inefficiencies, as it captures intermediate achievements such as customer intimacy at the front end and operational excellence at the back end. Furthermore, our case study findings suggest that when business integration puts greater emphasis on back-end processes, it has a stronger impact on firm performance than front-end functionality, which seems consistent with resource-based logics.",

The findings from our case study affirm that business integration in a complex e-business requires the effective management of its organisational interdependencies and asset orchestration, which has not been examined in previous research. We believe that the present study has practical implications for the attainment of business integration, which is especially significant for e-commerce firms competing to increase their capacity to respond quickly and effectively to changing market forces, to improve the quality of conformance to customer requirements or to reduce costs. With the aforementioned findings, we hope that the study helps managers to create structural synergies and manage the antagonisms arising between departments due to the differences created from interdependent relationships. Future research should be conducted to extend our understanding of how business integration is achieved through leveraging organisational interdependencies and asset orchestration.",
