Depending on assumptions about the coverage of the sentinel ILI network and health-care seeking behavior for cases of ILI associated with A(H7N9) virus infection, we estimated that the symptomatic case fatality risk could be between 160 and 2,800 per 100,000 symptomatic cases.",

            "text": "In the event of emergence of a new influenza virus with capacity to infect and cause disease in humans, such as the recent emergence of influenza A(H7N9) virus, risk assessment is an urgent public health priority. [1] [2] [3] In the recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, risk assessment metrics were broken down into ten criteria in three categories. 4 The three categories are (1) properties of the virus including potential for transmissibility; (2) properties of the population including preexisting immunity and the seriousness profile of human infections; and (3) ecology and epidemiology in animals and humans. The second category includes one of the most difficult criteria to assess, but the most important in terms of public health impact, 4 namely the clinical severity of human infections which includes measures such as the case fatality risk. 5 The seriousness of infections has major implications for the potential overall severity of an influenza pandemic. 3 However, it is challenging to assess severity because typically the most serious illnesses associated with infection have a much higher probability of being detected and laboratory-confirmed compared to mild illnesses. 6 Human infections with the novel influenza A(H7N9) virus were first identified in China in February-March 2013, and the initial laboratory-confirmed cases all occurred in patients with serious illness. [7] [8] [9] The earliest laboratory-confirmed cases were clustered around the Yangtze river delta while more recent laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in neighbouring provinces to the south and north. 10, 11 The majority of laboratory-confirmed cases occurred in urban areas in persons reporting recent exposure to live poultry, 11 investigation of live poultry markets in Huzhou found high prevalence of infection in poultry, 12 and closure of live poultry markets appears to have been effective in controlling outbreaks. [12] [13] [14] Intensive follow-up of more than 2,500 close contacts of laboratoryconfirmed cases identified just four potential secondary A(H7N9) virus infections, 11 consistent with very low human-to-human transmissibility. Pre-existing immunity to A(H7N9) virus is likely to be low in all age groups of the general population. 15 While initial estimates of clinical severity focused on the clinical severity and risk of fatality among the laboratory-confirmed cases, [8] [9] [10] this may give an incomplete picture of the clinical severity of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections. 16 As the outbreak has continued, it has become clear that undetected cases of milder symptomatic infections have occurred. First, assuming that there is no immunity across all ages, the pattern in age-specific incidence of serious cases is not consistent with presumed patterns in exposure, implying that severity increases with age and that many undetected mild infections have occurred in adults. 17 Second, six of the 131 laboratory-confirmed cases as of May 28, 2013 have been identified via national sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance (including the most recent case, reported on May 28), which is a population-wide system for measuring patterns in consultation rates of patients with ILI and conducting virologic testing for influenza virus infections in a subset of patients. 18, 19 Of the six cases with ages ranging from 2-26y, only one had pneumonia while the other five cases had uncomplicated illness. As this surveillance system is based on a sampling approach, laboratory confirmation of the six cases implies a substantial number of unconfirmed symptomatic infections with mild to moderate severity. Here, our objective is to assess the clinical severity profile of cases of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus based on available information to date, in order to inform assessment of potential pandemic risk. We estimated the clinical severity profile in terms of the risk of fatality, mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission among hospitalised cases, and the risk of fatality among symptomatic cases.",

Since some patients died without requiring mechanical ventilation, we grouped the two outcomes together to estimate the risk of mechanical ventilation or death, where the alternative outcome is recovery without requiring ventilation.

Specifically, we combined these data with the daily number of all ILI cases reported and specimens tested by ILI surveillance in the two cities to infer the number of A(H7N9) virus infections that would have sought medical care at ILI sentinels (N ILI-S ) (see Appendix for details on the statistical model). We then used two alternative methods to estimate the number of symptomatic infections in Shanghai and Nanjing. In method 1, we assumed that health-care seeking behaviour for cases of ILI associated with A(H7N9) virus infection was the same as health-care seeking behaviour for cases of ILI associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. We therefore divided N ILI-S by the proportion of symptomatic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections that attended medical care at ILI sentinels during the 2009 pandemic in China (Appendix).",

Using multiple imputation to account for missing data on calendar dates of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation for 1 and 23 patients who were known to have been admitted to ICU or ventilated, respectively, and allowing for censoring in 17 patients who are still hospitalised as of May 28, we estimated that 69% of hospitalised cases required mechanical ventilation or died, while almost all (83%) hospitalised cases required ICU admission/ventilation or died ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ). We estimated substantially higher risks of ICU admission (p=0.08), mechanical ventilation (p=0.0067), and death (p=0.0019) among hospitalised cases \u226560 years of age compared to younger cases ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ). There was some evidence that disease generally progressed or resolved faster in those <60 years of age compared to older cases (Figure 1, Figure 2) but with a small sample size we did not have sufficient statistical power to warrant further investigation. Estimating the hospitalisation fatality risk based on information available up to each date from April 23 through May 28, we found that the estimated risk gradually declined over time with considerable initial uncertainty, while the precision has increased over time because of increasing number of cases as well as longer follow-up of hospitalised cases (Figure 3 ).",

The confirmed cases of A(H7N9) are apparently biased towards infections associated with serious illnesses, 17 and yet a small proportion of confirmed cases were identified through sentinel ILI surveillance. Because of this underascertainment, the confirmed-case fatality risk would apply neither to hospitalised cases (in whom the risk of fatality is higher), nor to mild symptomatic cases of A(H7N9) virus infection. Shifts in case-ascertainment over time, for example by increasing the proportion of ILI specimens tested every week in affected regions, would change the confirmed-case fatality risk, perhaps substantially, without any actual change in the underlying clinical severity profile of A(H7N9) virus infection.",

The proportion of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections that sought medical care was likely to have been higher than assumed here because (i) laboratoryconfirmed A(H7N9) cases seemed to have faster and more severe disease progression than A(H1N1)pdm09 and (ii) residents of the highly developed cities of Shanghai and Nanjing were more likely to seek medical care than the general population of China.",

Clearly more work in dissemination of scientific methodologic findings and wider application in public health practice continues to be required.

            "text": "There are some limitations in our analyses. First, our estimates are real-time, calculated during the ongoing outbreak of A(H7N9) while some patients remain critically ill in hospital. Our estimates of hospitalisation fatality risks have fairly wide confidence intervals that will narrow as illnesses resolve. Second, while we were able to estimate age-specific hospitalisation fatality risks, we were not able to estimate age-specific symptomatic-case hospitalisation risks in the present analyses, and further work is needed in this area. Third, our estimates of the number of symptomatic A(H7N9) cases, by two methods, were based on extrapolation from the sentinel ILI network, and required a number of simplifying assumptions including complete ascertainment of hospitalised A(H7N9) cases and no changes in health-care seeking behaviour in late March and early April 2013 (Appendix). Our analysis may be biased if there were additional undetected hospitalisations associated with A(H7N9) for example because of lack of access to laboratory testing in some areas; or on the other hand more aggressive health-care attendance given the perceived severity of this novel infection. Fourth, without data on the proportion of subclinical or asymptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections we cannot estimate the infection fatality risk. Such information may be available from serologic studies in future. 41 Finally, clinical information on some laboratory-confirmed cases was not available, and standardized collection and sharing of clinical data would aid risk assessment and treatment. 42 In conclusion, our estimate of a symptomatic case fatality risk of between 160 and 2,800 deaths per 100,000 symptomatic cases places A(H7N9) below the severity of A(H5N1), 43 but above the severity of A(H1N1)pdm09. 44 We are not aware of comparative data on the symptomatic case fatality risks of seasonal influenza viruses but we speculate that they are of a similar order of magnitude to A(H1N1)pdm09. As with seasonal influenza, the severity of A(H7N9) increases with age. These findings will inform risk assessment and health policy during the current A(H7N9) outbreak, and preparations for a potential resurgence in human infections towards the end of 2013. 11 Our framework could be used for pandemic risk assessment of future avian influenza viruses that cause disease in humans.",

Some reports of the present outbreak of A(H7N9) in humans in China divided the number of deaths to date by the number of laboratory-confirmed cases to date, 9, 10, [28] [29] [30] and one of these studies clarified that this approach may underestimate the confirmed-case fatality risk since some patients remain hospitalised. 10 Other studies reported the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and the number of deaths to date without attempting to infer the case fatality risk. 1, 13, 18, 24, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] There was one published study estimating a lower bound of at least 210-550 symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections in China by April 21, 2013 based on patterns in incidence compared with presumed patterns in exposure. 17 We did not find any other published study that attempted to estimate the number of symptomatic cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection or the symptomatic case fatality risk.",

While most laboratoryconfirmed cases have required hospitalisation, and the majority of laboratory-confirmed hospitalised cases have required admission to intensive care units, the hospitalisation fatality risk for A(H7N9) of 36% appears to be lower than the hospitalisation fatality risk for A(H5N1) in China and elsewhere. Identification of five laboratory-confirmed cases in a network of 554 sentinel hospitals conducting ILI surveillance among outpatients in China is indicative of a much larger number of mild cases. Assuming either (1) that health-care seeking behavior was unchanged from A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 or (2) that all A(H7N9) cases with ILI sought care, we estimated symptomatic case fatality risks of (1) 160 or (2) 2,800 deaths per 100,000 symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infections, respectively. This places A(H7N9) below the severity of A(H5N1) but above the severity of A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza.",
