However, 26 these tests are often difficult to implement in a resource limited setting because of high cost. In 27 this study, we developed and validated a method for simultaneous testing of common respiratory 28 pathogens (Respanel) by real-time PCR in a convenient, strip-tube array format. Primers and 29 probes for sixteen PCR assays were selected from the literature or newly designed. Following 30 optimization of individual PCR assays, strip-tube arrays were prepared by dispensing primer-31 probe mixes (PPM) into two sets of 8-tube strips. Nucleic acid extracts from specimens were 32 mixed with PCR master mix, and dispensed column-wise into 2X8-wells of a 96-well plate.",

To make an appropriate choice, a careful assessment of 255 performance characteristics as well as costs and benefits associated with the test method is 256 necessary. Ideally, when performance characteristics of test methods are comparable and meet 257 regulatory requirements, a test method and a platform that provides rapid TAT and requires 258 minimum technical skill and hands on time would be preferable.

After initial optimization of PCR conditions, Respanel assay was validated in three steps. First, the accuracy of results obtained by each PCR assay was compared with results obtained by bacterial or viral culture, DFA, Resplex and standard PCR assays offered by the Microbiology and Virology laboratories of BC Children's Hospital, Canada. Next test comparisons were made with Resplex and FTDRP21 assays at two different laboratories using nasopharyngeal specimens. Despite multiple test types used as reference methods, Respanel assay demonstrated 85%-100% concordance with the reference methods. Respanel detected significantly (p=0.015 by Student's T-test) more pathogens than Resplex but was not different than the FTDRP21 panel 288 (p=0.27 by Student's T-test). This is consistent with the fact that Respanel and FTDRP21 are both real-time PCR based methods, while Resplex assay employed a different chemistry based on highly multiplexed PCR, probe hybridization and flow cytometry.To our knowledge, this is the first report of a strip-tube array based, clinical laboratory developed PCR test panel for respiratory pathogens designed for cost savings, convenience and superior or equivalent performance compared to commercial assays. Furthermore, the laboratory developed, Respanel has the additional advantage of flexibility to update, modify, incorporate or replace pathogen targets as required, and to serve specific patient populations with acuteThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
