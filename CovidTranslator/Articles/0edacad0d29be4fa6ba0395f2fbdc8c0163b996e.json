Because T cell selection by peptide plus self-MHC in the thymus requires TCR engagement, we hypothesized that type 1 cytokines may polarize developing T cells. We cultured thymi from BBDR rats in adult thymus organ cultures (ATOC) under type 1 cytokine conditions in the absence of exogenous antigen. Type 1 cytokine-conditioned ATOC generated cells that spontaneously secreted high levels of IFN , but not IL-4. A second exposure to type 1 cytokines further increased IFN secretion by these cells, most of which were blasts that expressed the activation markers CD25, CD71, CD86, and CD134. Studies using blocking antibodies and pharmacological inhibitors suggested that both IL-18 and cognate TCR-MHC/ligand interactions were important for activation. Blocking anti-MHC class I plus anti-MHC class II antibodies, neutralizing anti-IL-18 antibody, and the p38 MAP-kinase inhibitor SB203580 each reduced IFN production by w75-80%. Cyclosporin A, which prevents TCR signaling, inhibited IFN production by w50%. These data demonstrate that exposure to type 1 cytokines during intrathymic development can polarize differentiating T cells, and suggest a mechanism by which intrathymic exposure to type 1 cytokines may modulate T cell development.",

NK T cells, basophils, mast cells, and T cells themselves are all candidate sources [11, 12] . The IL-12 that promotes type 1 cytokine responses in vivo is produced primarily by dendritic cells and macrophages; IL-12 is secreted rapidly in response to infection by many intracellular pathogens [5, [13] [14] [15] . Microbial LPS, bacterial DNA containing CpG motifs, and Leishmania antigen are also potent inducers of IL-12 in phagocytic cells [5] . The response of the innate immune system to some infectious agents and microbial products is vigorous enough to increase levels of circulating IL-12. For example, infection with murine cytomegalovirus [13, 16] or Toxoplasma gondii [17] , or exposure to LPS [18] or the dsRNA viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) [19] markedly increases circulating IL-12 levels in vivo in mice. Activation of APCs by pathogens, causing them to secrete IL-12 could, therefore, have systemic effects on T cells. IL-12 is also produced, in the absence of infection, by dendritic cells after cognate interaction with T cells [20, 21] and in the thymus [22, 23] .",

To test this hypothesis, we used rat adult thymus organ cultures (ATOC) to examine the effect of exposure to a type 1 cytokine environment on T cell development. We chose to study thymi from BBDR rats because we have shown previously that BBDR rat ATOC recapitulate normal thymocyte development, and generate normal ratios of functional CD4 + and CD8 + single positive TCR hi cells [27, 28] . The BBDR rat is phenotypically normal and disease-free, but can be induced to develop autoimmune diabetes by environmental perturbants, including viral infection [29] [30] [31] .

To address this possibility, we performed an additional set of experiments consisting of ATOC plus type 1 cytokines followed by secondary suspension culture using rat serum (N\u03ed4) or fetal bovine serum (N\u03ed4). We observed that the concentration of IFN generated by both cultures was statistically similar (42.7 17.9 10 5 pg/ml using rat serum and 82.1 30.0 10 5 pg/ml using bovine serum). The latter value is similar to that shown in Fig. 1 for the same conditions. The result suggests that elevated IFN secretion was not due solely to xenogeneic T cell reactivity.",

Re-exposure of these cells to type 1 cytokines induced even more production of IFN and was associated with T cell activation. These events occurred in the absence of exogenous foreign antigen.

Our data clearly document the secretion of copious amounts of IFN and of T cell activation following exposure of ATOC to type 1 cytokines. Most importantly, the data suggest that intrathymic polarization could be an important process in vivo as well as in vitro. We note that IL-12, the principal agent of polarization used in these studies, is synthesized in the thymus [22, 23] and circulates at high levels after exposure to certain pathogens [5, 13, [16] [17] [18] [55, 56] or following administration of CpG DNA [57] . Nonlethal doses of Toxoplasma gondii, Toxoplasma cruzi, MCMV or CpG DNA given to mice result in circulating levels of IL-12 that range from 0.45 to 15 ng/ml, with persistence in the serum from 36 h to 8 days. Ex vivo production of IL-12 by cells from mice given CpG DNA, T. gondii, or Mycoplasma bovis range from 1-5 ng/ml in 24-48 h cultures of spleen or lymph node cells, or cultures of APCs [18, 58, 59] . Culture of human PBL or monocytes with seven different species of gram positive bacteria or Heliobacter pylori induces the production of w1-4 ng/ml of IL-12 after 18-24 h in culture [59, 60] . In addition, virus infections in humans and mice can further increase sensitivity to concurrent or subsequent bacterial challenges by a mechanism that involves elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 [61] . Circulating IL-12 levels following exposure to certain pathogens are therefore comparable to those able to polarize thymocytes in ATOC.",

The key to our discovery was the use of ATOC [27] . Thymocytes survive poorly in cell suspension cultures, irrespective of whether the cells are cultured in the presence or absence of type 1 cytokines (B.J.W., unpublished observations). In contrast, rat ATOC allows normal thymocyte development and selection to occur in vitro. It overcomes the problem of in vivo studies by allowing for analysis of T cell development in the absence of seeding of the thymus with thymocyte progenitors and in the absence of emigration from the thymus [27] . Rat ATOC recapitulates faithfully normal rat intrathymic T cell developmental kinetics and phenotypes. It generates CD4 and CD8 single positive cells that up-regulate the TCR, as is characteristic of peripheral T cells [27] .",

We interpret these data to suggest that TCR-MHCligand interactions play an important role in the activation of the T cells that are cultured in type 1 cytokines.

After a secondary exposure to type 1 cytokines, there is a substantial increase in the percent of IFN + cells.

            "text": "The combination of IL-12 and IL-2 is optimal for type 1 cytokine polarization of both ATOC and secondary cultures (Table 2 ; Fig. 5 ). Anti-IL-4 by itself is not sufficient to bias cells to a type 1 cytokine response, but it was shown to facilitate IFN production in the ATOC but not in secondary cultures. We were unable to detect IL-4 in day 5 ATOC by ELISA in cultures that received IL-12 plus IL-2 (<8 pg/ml in four determinations), but it is possible that IL-4 could have been produced earlier in the ATOC and/or utilized by day 5. Based on our observation that exposure of developing thymocytes to polarizing conditions generates activated T cells, we speculate that the exposure of thymocytes in vivo to analogous conditions may represent a mechanism underlying the generation and survival of self-reactive T cells in genetically pre-disposed individuals. If polarizing conditions were to be present in the thymus, selfreactivity might result from interference with the negative selection of high affinity self-reactive T cells or from the promotion of positive selection. Alternatively, selfantigens might be cross-presented to T cells as a result of cytokine induced maturation of APCs, a mechanism that has been described for peripheral T cells [65, 66] . Many self-antigens are expressed by thymic stromal cells, and correlative studies suggest that intrathymic self-antigen expression may play an important role in T cell tolerance [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . Self-antigens that are normally expressed at levels too low to induce positive selection might do so in the context of a pro-inflammatory environment, up-regulated APC function [5, 72] , and a lowered threshold for T cell activation [73, 74] . The role of type 1 cytokines in altering selection during intrathymic development is unknown, but perturbation of intrathymic selection in experimental systems has been shown to lead to the generation of autoreactive T cells [75] [76] [77] . Environmental perturbation in general, and infection in particular, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases [78, 79] . Polarizing conditions within the thymus resulting from high circulating levels of IL-12 generated by infection could represent a mechanism linking genetic susceptibility to autoreactivity to the environmental 'triggers' of autoimmune disease.",

We speculate that thymocytes in vivo could be exposed to a type 1 cytokine environment as a result of IL-12 produced endogenously or in response to infection. The relative importance of intrathymic polarization as a normal physiological response mechanism and a pathophysiological process leading to autoimmunity remains under study in our laboratory.",
