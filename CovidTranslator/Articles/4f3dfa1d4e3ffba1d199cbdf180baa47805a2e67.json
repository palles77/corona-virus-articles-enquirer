It is acknowledged that filling this gap needs a combination of rigorous sampling and improved diagnostic technologies.

Recent epidemiological studies suggest that the global burden of encephalitis has been grossly underestimated, with current incidence suggested to be over 6000 annual cases in the UK, and 500,000 worldwide. 3, 4 The syndrome encapsulates a myriad of diverse diseases, with distinct global distributions, presenting features and clinical courses. 4, 5 Infections represent the most frequently identified aetiology, with data suggesting this accounts for 20-50% of cases. 2, 6, 7 Hundreds of pathogens have been associated with encephalitis, with the most frequently identified including Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), enteroviruses, Measles morbillivirus, Mumps virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), influenza viruses, adenoviruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 4 HSV, JEV and rabies are the chief causes in Europe, Asia and Africa respectively. The main alternative aetiology to infection is immune mediated, for which management includes immune suppression. It is critical to differentiate between autoimmune and infectious causes of encephalitis; immune suppression in cases where the cause is an undiscovered pathogen could be devastating.",

Further, there is a lack of a systematic approach to access to pathogen discovery methods, discussed below. It is only the newest French guidelines in which NGS is mentioned at all, and the authors reasonably state that the clinical role is still to be evaluated. 19 ",

Informed by clinical presentation, epidemiological data, guidelines and local resources, a laboratory will perform targeted tests for a disease. These are largely confined to specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serological assays. This approach has fundamental limitations, and contributes to the relatively high proportion of encephalitis cases that remain undiagnosed. Aside from the difficulties of testing for the myriad of rare pathogens that might be expected to cause encephalitis, this approach does not permit the identification of new or unexpected pathogens. Undeniably, methods for novel pathogen discovery such as electron microscopy and cell culture have existed for many years, however they are cumbersome, time-consuming, lack sensitivity and specificity and are often no longer routinely available. Furthermore, there are groups of patients, such as immunosuppressed patients, who frequently present with subtle or non-specific symptoms and signs, are high-risk for encephalitis, infection with unexpected or unusual pathogens, and are seen to have more severe outcomes. 21 There is a need for improved diagnostic methods for encephalitis. A method which has recently been applied to pathogen detection in cases of encephalitis is metagenomic analysis using next generation sequencing (NGS). Proof of concept for its use in the diagnosis of encephalitis has been demonstrated in the literature, however its suitability for routine diagnosis has not been assessed and is the subject of this review.",

Six cases identified novel small circular ssDNA viruses in the CSF of patients with encephalitis of unknown aetiology; three cycloviruses 29, 37 and three gemycircularviruses. 37 However, the clinical significance of these is doubtful. Phan et al. 37 confirmed, via repeat DNA extraction using an alternative method, that the source of the cyclovirus is not reagent contamination. Nevertheless, whilst screening CSF samples for cyclovirus by PCR, Tan et al. 29 detected cyclovirus in the CSF of patients in whom the aetiology of their central nervous system (CNS) disease had already been confirmed as Japanese encephalitis, dengue virus or bacterial meningitis. The only identified cellular host for gemycircularviruses is fungi. In the absence of other evidence of pathogenicity, such as seroconversion or demonstration of the pathogen within cells in the brain, the probability remains that detection of cyclovirus or gemycircularvirus in CSF is an incidental finding. Similarly the detection of densovirus, a small linear ssDNA virus, in CSF may be incidental since it was detected in a case with confirmed N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor encephalitis. 44 Autoimmune antibodies have previously been co-detected with herpesvirus DNA in CSF from cases of encephalitis, 53 however the host range of densoviruses is to date exclusively invertebrates; the authors suggest a possible explanation for detection in CSF is the passive transfer of virus from an insect bite or CSF contamination from skin flora or an environmental source.

In three cases a pathogen was detected in brain biopsy but not in CSF 32, 35, 48 while the opposite was not observed, although in one instance the proportion of pathogen reads was greater in CSF than brain biopsy. 33 In our hands, the diagnostic yield for metagenomics in encephalitis is, to date, 50% (8/16) all of which were brain biopsies. The eight identified pathogens were coronavirus OC-43, 43 two cases of vaccine derived mumps virus, 48, 54 Toxoplasma gondii (unpublished) and four cases of astrovirus VA1/HMO-C 31,42 (two cases unpublished). All of our positive results were in immunocompromised patients and in the majority of cases there was a high index of suspicion of infection, suggesting metagenomics may be best applied to a targeted population in whom it will be most rewarding.",

This is also a recognised problem with pan-bacterial PCR detection which is used clinically, 55 however can be confounded in metagenomics by differences between specimens and specimen types (for instance tissue biopsies versus CSF) in the quantity of genomic material, the ratio of host:pathogen sequences and, depending on the sequencing chemistry and degree of specimen multiplexing, the sequencing yield. Some of these limitations may be overcome by the careful use of processing and sequencing controls, as discussed elsewhere. 23 Whilst metagenomics will produce a sequence for every fragment of DNA or RNA in a specimen, only pathogens with homology to known organisms in the sequence database of choice will be identified. If an organism is missing from the database, or if the pathogen causing infection is novel with no homology to known organisms, it will not be identified.

In order to detect pathogen sequences, which can be as few as nine in 68 million reads, 30 vast sequencing read depths are required; very high throughput sequencing platforms with only a very limited number of samples sequenced in parallel are required to achieve this. To overcome this, depletion of host DNA or RNA prior to sequencing is required; however the options for this are currently limited and are not all suitable for detection of viral pathogens.

For these reasons, the role of NGS in clinical algorithms is still to be delineated. At this point in time, we suggest NGS is routinely applied for the diagnosis of acute cases of encephalitis for which no cause is found after targeted investigations using PCR. Recommendations for firstline targeted testing are discussed in detail elsewhere 14 but in the UK should include PCR for HSV, VZV and enteroviruses. However due to differing local epidemiology clinicians should consult the relevant national guidelines. 8, 13, 14, 16, 17 In immunocompromised patients however, metagenomics ought to be considered earlier; 73% of case reports in this review involved immunocompromised patients. This is the population at most risk of infection with novel and unexpected organisms and, moreover, may present with a more chronic or insidious clinical history 58 in which a one-week turn-aroundtime is more acceptable. Given that the causative pathogen is not always detected in CSF, in all cases of encephalitis in which diagnosis by NGS is being sought the preferred specimen type is brain biopsy. Nevertheless CSF samples are acceptable if it is the only specimen available. Our recommendations for the use of NGS in diagnosis of microbial causes of encephalitis are summarised in Fig. 5a , with the contrasting algorithm for targeted testing summarised in Fig. 5b . This review was limited to pathogen detection by NGS in brain biopsies or CSF. There may also be a role for testing other specimens, such as throat samples and urine. This was recently shown in an encephalitis case diagnosed by NGS of urine, identifying a case of Japanese encephalitis virus. 59 It is expected that over the next few years, the cost and time-to-result of metagenomics will reduce, and with this, it is foreseen that it will be possible to offer this as the first-line diagnostic test. This depends on the ability to deplete host DNA and RNA prior to sequencing, reduced read depth requirement and faster sequencing and bioinformatics technologies.",

However, since up to 20% of cases of encephalitis are caused by autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system attacks specific host proteins, 21,61 a comprehensive diagnostic service should include antibody mediated, as well as infectious, causes of encephalitis. The clinical presentation of autoimmune (non-infectious) and infectious encephalitis are similar, 62 however the treatment is often opposing. Non-infectious causes may require immunosuppressive therapy 63 ; however administering immunosuppressive therapy where the cause is infectious exacerbates the infection, with potentially fatal results. A conclusive diagnosis of the causative agent of encephalitis would improve differentiation between infectious and auto-immune causes thus appropriate management of immunosuppression.",
