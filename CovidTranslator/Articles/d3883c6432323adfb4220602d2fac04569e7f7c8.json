            "text": "Background/Purpose: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease ranging in severity from steatosis to cirrhosis. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a cause of primary NAFLD. T Thiazolidinediones have been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity, improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients and to improve the histologic markers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. This study aims to determine the safety and effectiveness of rosiglitazone in inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes patients with NAFLD. Methods: Taiwanese type 2 diabetes patients with inadequate control on insulin secretagogues and metformin, with no history of significant alcohol ingestion, with mildly elevated serum aspartate aminoy transferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and a diagnosis of fatty liver determined by ultrasonography were enrolled. Patients were treated for 24 weeks with rosiglitazone, 4-8 mg daily. Primary endpoints were change in AST and ALT levels from baseline and reduction in A1C < 6.5%. Results: Out of a total of 68 patients, 60 (88.2%) completed the study treatment without serious adverse events. Treatment in two (2.9%) patients was discontinued due to elevated AST or ALT levels to more than three times the upper limit of normal, and noncompliance or loss of follow-up in six (8.8%) patients. Of the 60 patients who completed the study treatment, mean fasting plasma glucose, A1C, fasting plasma insulin, mean ALT and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance were all significantly reduced. Normal A AST and ALT levels were achieved and maintained for at least three consecutive measurements and through to the end of the study period in 20 (33.3%) patients. Weight increased by a mean of 2.6 \u00b1 2.4 kg (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Rosiglitazone was reasonably well tolerated in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. One-third of patients showed improved liver function after treatment. [J Formos Med A Assoc 2006;105(9):743-752] ",

By the end of the 48 weeks, serum ALT had decreased to normal in 72% of patients. Hepatic fat content and size as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were also decreased. Using strict criteria, histologic improvement occurred in two-thirds of patients. There w was a strong positive correlation between changes in fat in the liver, as determined by MRI, and degree of steatosis, as determined by liver biopsy. 19 In another study, adults with biopsy-proven NASH w were treated with rosiglitazone for 48 weeks. T The 25 patients who completed the treatment had significantly improved insulin sensitivity and mean serum ALT levels (104 IU/L initially, 42 IU/L at the end of treatment). The mean global necroinflammatory score significantly improved with treatment, and the biopsies of 10 patients r (45%) no longer met the reported criteria for NASH after treatment. 14 These results indicate that treatment with TZD can lead to improvement in the biochemical and histologic features of NASH and support the role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of this disease. 14, 19 r For patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diar betes and NAFLD with mildly abnormal liver function, the results of this study suggest that a trial of rosiglitazone can improve liver function within 3 months in one-third of patients. These r patients require long-term follow-up to monitor blood glucose control, liver function, NAFLD change and insulin sensitivity.",

            "text": "The present study suggests that rosiglitazone is safe and has beneficial effects on liver function in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients with NAFLD. Improved liver function may result from several factors. First, TZDs improve insulin resistance by increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral organs and in the liver. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Second, TZDs improve several components of the metabolic syndrome that could beneficially affect endothelial function, including reduction in circulating concentration of free fatty acids and improvement of lipid profile. [7] [8] [9] 12, 13 Third, TZDs have important antig inflammatory effects that involve decreasing adipocytokine levels (e.g. TNF-\u03b1, PAI-1), [10] [11] [12] [13] [30] [31] [32] y which are reflected by reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, increasing adiponectin levels and attenuating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. 33 TZDs have been shown to decrease inflammatory markers much earlier than a fall in either insulin or glucose concentrations in diabetes. 34 Our study confirmed this finding, r with a fairly rapid initial improvement in liver function observed much earlier than a fall in t glucose concentration. Decrease in A1C was not associated with a change in ALT, and no associa-R tion was found between change in HOMA-IR and ALT as shown in Figure 2 . These findings suggest that rosiglitazone may have effects beyond glucose lowering, such as anti-inflammatory eft fects, which are responsible for improvement of liver function. There was no significant change in fatty liver after rosiglitazone use, as determined by abdominal sonography in either responders or nonresponders. This could be due to the relatively short duration of treatment, with biochemical changes preceding imaging alterations. T The lack of significant correlation between A1C or HOMA-IR and ALT may have been due to the small decrease in ALT and/or the relatively short treatment period.",

T The incidence of peripheral edema was 20.0%, w which is higher than was reported with TZD monotherapy or therapy with sulfonylureas and/ or metformin (4.1-12.4%). 7, 8, 21, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] However, both WC and WHR significantly decreased after rosiglitazone use (Table) , which indicates a more peripheral redistribution of fat. Previous reports also indicated that the weight gained during the use of these drugs tends to be peripheral fat rather than visceral fat and, therefore, may not be associated with increased risks linked to the metabolic syndrome. [10] [11] [12] [13] Similar to the findings in other studies, rosiglitazone treatment resulted in an increase in mean T TC, LDL-C and HDL-C. 7, 8, 21 There was a decrease in TG in this study, although the change was not significant. Mean diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after rosiglitazone use. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia have been shown to be causally related to hypertension through direct effects on vascular tone, stimulation of the adrenergic nervous system and antinatriuresis. 35 In this study, HOMA-IR improved after rosiglitazone use and the reduction in diastolic pressure could be due to the improved insulin sensitivity. Diagnosis of NAFLD is based on noninvasive and invasive tests, with liver biopsy being the most definitive modality. The major limitation of this study was the lack of confirmative NAFLD by liver biopsy, although this confirmation would not be practical in most clinical settings. In clinical practice, steatosis is commonly detected by noninvasive imaging with ultrasonography, computed axial tomography (CT) and MRI.",

When CT is used in the diagnosis of NAFLD, diagnostic accuracy is time-dependent and protocolspecific, and there is considerable individual y variability as well as intraindividual variability r during multiple examinations in the absolute liver attenuation numbers. 36 r Arguments against liver f biopsy include the generally good prognosis of most patients with NAFLD, the lack of an established effective therapy, and the risks and costs associated with biopsy. In clinical practice, the c diagnosis of NAFLD is based on ultrasonographic r evidence of \"bright liver\" and reduced posterior attenuation in subjects with no or moderate alcohol consumption. 37 Selecting imaging studies g over liver biopsy has the advantage of avoiding the risks associated with an invasive procedure. y Ultrasonography defines increased echogenicity in NAFLD and is thought to be a reasonably sensitive study. 38 The treatment duration of 24 weeks in this study is relatively short. Further long-term studies, y which combine the assessment of inflammatory markers with CT, MRI or liver biopsy, are needed to determine whether improvements in liver function are due to improvement in fatty liver, and to what extent they can be sustained over a prolonged period.",
