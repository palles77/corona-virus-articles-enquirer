Probability density functions for generation intervals have been an important input for epidemic models and epidemic data analysis. In this paper, we specify a general stochastic SIR epidemic model and prove that the mean generation interval decreases when susceptible persons are at risk of infectious contact from multiple sources. The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person has multiple potential infectors, there is a \"race\" to infect him or her in which only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the mean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We call this global competition among potential infectors. When there is rapid transmission within clusters of contacts, generation interval contraction can be caused by a high local prevalence of infection even when the global prevalence is low. We call this local competition among potential infectors. Using simulations, we illustrate both types of competition. Finally, we show that hazards of infectious contact can be used instead of generation intervals to estimate the time course of the effective reproductive number in an epidemic. This approach leads naturally to partial likelihoods for epidemic data that are very similar to those that arise in survival analysis, opening a promising avenue of methodological research in infectious disease epidemiology.",

This is sometimes called the \"generation interval.\" However, we find it more useful to adopt the terminology of Svensson [2] and define the generation interval as the difference between the infection time of an infected person and the infection time of his or her infector. By these definitions, the serial interval is observable while the generation interval usually is not. We define infectious contact from i to j to be a contact that is sufficient to infect j if i is infectious and j is susceptible, and we define a potential infector of person i to be an infectious person who has positive probability of making infectious contact with i. Finally, we use the term hazard rather than force of infection to highlight the similarities between epidemic data analysis and survival analysis.",

More recently, generation interval distributions have been used to calculate the incubation period distribution of SARS [7] and to estimate R 0 from the exponential growth rate at the beginning of an epidemic [8] . It is generally assumed that the generation interval distribution is characteristic of an infectious disease. In this paper, we show that this is not true. Instead, the expected generation interval decreases as the number of potential infectors of susceptibles increases. During an epidemic, generation intervals tend to contract as the prevalence of infection increases. This effect was described by Svensson [2] for an SIR model with homogeneous mixing.

Then so the expected generation interval decreases as the number of potential infectors increases. A hazard of infection that increases with the number of potential infectors is a defining feature of most epidemic models, so generation interval contraction is a very general phenomenon. We note that a very similar phenomenon occurs in endemic diseases, where increased force of infection results in a decreased average age at first infection [9] .",

Since \u03c4 ij is nonnegative, \u03bb ij (\u03c4| r i ) = 0 whenever \u03c4 < 0. Let H(t) denote the set of infection times and recovery periods for all i such that t i \u2264 t. If person k is susceptible [summationtext] at time t, his or her total hazard of infection at time t given H(t) is , where we let \u03bb 0k (t -t 0 |r 0 ) = \u03bb 0k (t) for simplicity of notation. If an infection occurs in person k at time t k < \u221e, then the conditional probability that person j infected person k given H(t k ) is (5) which is the probability that t jk = min(t 0k , t 1k , ..., t nk ). This has the same form as equation (4) except that it uses hazards of infectious contact instead of a pdf for the serial interval. If the hazards of infectious contact in the underlying SIR model do not change over the course of an epidemic, then p jk can be estimated accurately throughout an epidemic. Unlike the assumption of a stable generation or serial interval distribution, this assumption is unaffected by competition among potential infectors. The rest of the estimation of R(t) could proceed exactly as in Ref. [4] , replacing with p jk .",

If we don't require that an infectious contact leads to the transmission of infection, we are led naturally to the concept of the infectious contact interval, which has a well-defined distribution throughout an epidemic. Similarly, we can define R 0 as the mean number of infectious contacts (i.e., finite infectious contact intervals) made by a primary case without reference to a completely susceptible population. Generation and serial intervals and the effective reproductive number can then be defined in terms of infectious contacts that actually lead to the transmission of infection. Many fundamental concepts in infectious disease epidemiology can be simplified usefully by defining them in terms of infectious contact rather than infection transmission.",
