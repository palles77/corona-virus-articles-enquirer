The goal of this study was to determine the recovery efficiencies and the survival of two respiratory viruses, namely, adenovirus 2 (Ad2) and coronavirus 229E (CoV229E), on fresh produce in comparison to the enteric poliovirus 1 (PV1). Adenovirus was recovered with efficiencies of 56.5, 31.8, and 34.8 % from lettuce, strawberries, and raspberries, respectively. Coronavirus was recovered from lettuce with an efficiency of 19.6 % yet could not be recovered from strawberries. Poliovirus was recovered with efficiencies of 76.7 % from lettuce, but only 0.06 % from strawberries. For comparison purposes, the survival of Ad2, CoV229E, and PV1 was determined for periods up to 10 days on produce. The enteric PV1 survived better than both respiratory viruses on lettuce and strawberries, with only B1.03 log 10 reductions after 10 days of storage at 4\u00b0C compared to CoV229E not being recovered after 4 days on lettuce and reductions of 1.97 log 10 and 2.38 log 10 of Ad2 on lettuce and strawberries, respectively, after 10 days. Nevertheless, these respiratory viruses were able to survive for at least several days on produce. There is therefore the potential for transfer to the hands and subsequently to the mucosa via rubbing the eyes or nose. In addition, some respiratory Introduction There are 1.5 million deaths from respiratory infections worldwide each year (World Health Organization 2006) . In the United States, adults and children less than 5 years experience *1.5-3.0 and 3.5-5.5 respiratory illnesses per year, respectively (Monto and Sullivan 1993) . Viruses account for up to 69 % of all respiratory infections. These include illnesses caused by influenza viruses (A and B), rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza viruses (1-4), human coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS, 229E, and OC43), adenoviruses (primarily serotypes 4 and 7), and Coxsackievirus A21 (Monto and Sullivan 1993; Couch 1995; Boone and Gerba 2007) . Viruses are particularly significant as etiologic agents of respiratory infections in the young and the elderly (Klein 2004) . In pediatric respiratory units, adenoviral infections can be devastating; the fatality rate in hospital-acquired cases is 91 %. The hands of hospital attendants are believed to spread the virus .",

Some respiratory viruses irritate the respiratory epithelium and induce coughing and sneezing, thereby facilitating their transmission by not only the airborne route, but also by environmental contamination with the generated aerosols/ droplets (Hall et al. 1980; Barker et al. 2001; Boone and Gerba 2007) . The primary route of transmission is at times difficult to determine and is often a point of contention among researchers. In addition, unusual circumstances or conditions may lead to an atypical route of transmission for respiratory viruses. For instance, environmental contamination by stools played a significant role in the transmission of SARS coronavirus in certain outbreak populations in China (Dowell et al. 2004; Chu et al. 2005; Thomas et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "PV1 was recovered with an efficiency of 76.7 % from lettuce in this study. This is greater than the 58 % recovery efficiency reported by Ward et al. (1982) . In contrast, the recovery of PV1 from strawberries was only 0.06 %, demonstrating that virus recoveries from different types of produce can vary significantly. Similarly, the recovery efficiency of CoV229E from lettuce was 19.6 %, whereas the virus was not recovered from strawberries. Such differences between the recoveries of viruses from berries versus lettuce are likely due to the fact that fruits such as strawberries and raspberries have a porous surface texture which may trap viruses beyond the reach of chemical disinfectants or eluents (Richards 2001) . Alternatively, the elution process itself may cause damage to the surfaces of soft fruits, resulting in greater virus retention. The low pH of fruits, which are typically below those of vegetables, may also affect the sorption of viruses to the produce surface and therefore their recovery. The pH of strawberries is 3.0-3.9, raspberries is 2.9-3.5, and iceberg lettuce is *6.0 (Martin-Diana et al. 2005; Roberts et al. 2005a, b) . Basic buffers (pH 7.4-9.5) are recommended as eluents to extract viruses from acidic fruits in order to prevent a drop in the pH of the eluent during the elution process which may reduce virus recovery (Croci et al. 2008) . Le Guyader et al. (2004) reported that detecting viruses on berries, particularly raspberries, is difficult because of the presence of various inhibitors as well as the low pH. Butot et al. (2007) found recovery efficiencies of 1.99, 0.42, and 1.1 % of hepatitis A virus, norovirus, and rotavirus, respectively, from fresh strawberries, and similarly low efficiencies of 2.3, 3.1, and 1.3 % for these three viruses, respectively, from frozen raspberries.",

Strawberry producers also recommend not washing berries until just before serving, and to avoid contact with moisture (e.g., misters) in the food market. Such moisture causes rapid breakdown of the berries. Raspberries are very perishable and should always be kept between 0 and 1\u00b0C. Under ideal conditions, strawberries should have a shelflife of 2-5 days and raspberries should have a shelf-life of 1-2 days in the consumer's refrigerator. In the virus survival experiments, the produce samples were stored in covered bottles to avoid evaporation of the inoculum volume during storage; however, the fruits started to deteriorate before day 10 due to the excess moisture. Raspberry deterioration was much more pronounced than that observed with strawberries. For this reason, the survival of PV1 and CoV229E on raspberries was not determined.",

CoV229E was very sensitive to the elution process. The recovery efficiencies were low, with no virus recovered from strawberries and only 19.6 % recovered from lettuce. In addition, the CoV229E fell to below the detection limit of our assay within 4 days of storage at 4\u00b0C. These results are comparable with those obtained by Gundy et al.

            "text": "The results of this study demonstrate that respiratory viruses may persist on fresh fruit and vegetables for several days at the refrigeration temperature commonly used to store fresh produce in the average consumer household. Contamination of fresh produce may therefore result in the transmission of not only the enteric viruses that are traditionally considered ''foodborne'' pathogens, but also possibly respiratory viruses such as adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses that can infect via contact with mucosal membranes. Considering the low infectious dose of many viral agents, there will always be a risk of infection from the exposure to or consumption of food contaminated with respiratory or enteric viruses if no regular preventive produce surface sanitization is performed. This is of particular concern for uncooked fruits and vegetables. In addition, food handlers that are ill with respiratory rather than non-gastrointestinal disease could still pose a potential health risk for food consumers, particularly while preparing ''finger foods'' that come into contact with the consumers' hands which can then transfer the viruses to the mucosa via hand to mouth contact or by rubbing the eyes or nose (Hendley et al. 1973; Goldmann 2000) . The World Health Organization has highlighted the importance of hygiene, particularly that of hands, in minimizing the spread of respiratory tract infections (Hendley et al. 1973; Rusin et al. 2002; Bell 2006) . Numerous respiratory viruses can survive on hands for significant periods of time and may be transferred from hands to fomites (such as produce) and back again (Hall et al. 1980; Ansari et al. 1991; Morens and Rash 1995; Barker et al. 2001 ). In addition, some respiratory coronaviruses (e.g., SARS coronavirus) and adenoviruses are also capable of replication in the gut and there is thus the potential for acquisition through the consumption of contaminated produce.",
