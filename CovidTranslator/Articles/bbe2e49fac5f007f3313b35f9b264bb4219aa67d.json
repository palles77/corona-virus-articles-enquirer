Here, we review the roles of carbohydrates in the infection strategies of various enteric pathogens including viruses, bacteria and protozoa, which infect the epithelial lining of the human and animal intestine. At host cell entry, enteric viruses, including norovirus, recognize mainly histo-blood group antigens. At the initial step of bacterial infections, carbohydrates also function as receptors for attachment. Here, we describe the function of carbohydrates in infection by Salmonella enterica and several bacterial species that produce a variety of fimbrial adhesions. During invasion by enteropathogenic protozoa, apicomplexan parasites utilize sialic acids or sulfated glycans. Carbohydrates serve as receptors for infection by these microbes; however, their usage of carbohydrates varies depending on the microbe. On the surface of the mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract, various carbohydrate moieties are present and play a crucial role in infection, representing the site of infection or route of access for most microbes. During the infection and/or invasion process of the microbes, carbohydrates function as receptors for various microbes, but they can also function as a barrier to infection. One approach to develop effective prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial agents is to modify the drug structure. Another approach is to modify the mode of inhibition of infection depending on the individual pathogen by using and mimicking the interactions with carbohydrates. In addition, similarities in mode of infection may also be utilized. Our findings will be useful in the development of new drugs for the treatment of enteric pathogens.",

In humans and animals, the enteric pathogens, which include viruses, bacteria and protozoa, infect the intestine epithelial lining, resulting in food poisoning or diarrheal disease. When enteric pathogens enter humans or animals via the oral route, they must withstand the proteolytic conditions in the stomach before penetrating the mucus layer and accessing the underlying gut epithelium for attachment or cell invasion. Adhesion of the enteric pathogens to the intestine epithelial tissue is a prerequisite for the initiation of infection. In many systems it is mediated by lectins present on the surface of the pathogen that bind to complementary carbohydrates on the surface of the host cells. Carbohydrates such as heparan sulfate have been reported to play a crucial role in the entry or budding of viruses [1] , and bacterial lectins typically act in the form of elongated submicroscopic multisubunit protein appendages, known as pili [2] . Recently, the surface proteins of apicomplexan parasites have also been reported to bind to carbohydrates on host cells [3] . Thus the initial steps of host cell recognition by enteric pathogens may incorporate common strategies.",

Norovirus, a member of the family Caliciviridae, is a major cause of acute water-and food-borne gastroenteritis [4] . Norovirus infection is associated with up to 90% of epidemic nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis cases worldwide [5] . Noroviruses are divided into at least five genotypes, three of which (genogroups I, II, and IV) infect humans. Except for a few genotypes, all noroviruses bind to HBGAs including ABH antigens and Lewis antigens [5, 6] . In HBGAs, carbohydrate core structures constitute antigenically distinct phenotypes, namely type 1 (Gal\u03b21-3GlcNAc\u03b2) and type 2 (Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b2). H antigen (Fuc-\u03b11-2Gal), i.e., O-type antigen, is generated by fucose transfer to a galactose residue with an \u03b11-2 linkage of type 1 or type 2. The A antigen (GalNAc \u03b11-3(Fuc-\u03b11-2)Gal) and B antigen (Gal \u03b11-3(Fuc-\u03b11-2)Gal) of HBGAs are generated by transfer of GalNAc and Gal, respectively, to an H structure irrespective of the carbohydrate core structure. FUT1 and FUT2 are \u03b11,2FUTs that catalyze the transfer of Fuc to the Gal residue of type 1 and 2 chains, thereby resulting in the synthesis of H type 1 and H type 2, respectively. HBGAs are found in saliva and mucosal secretions from the intestinal epithelial cells of secretors (i.e., individuals who have the FUT2 gene that encodes a fucosyltransferase).",

Moreover, the association data between blood type and NV/68 infection showed that, among secretor volunteers, blood groups O and A were associated with an increased risk of infection, while blood group B was associated with a decreased risk. On the other hand, epidemiological studies have shown that some norovirus strains with ABH phenotypes that differ from that of NV/68 can infect individuals. GII/4, which is known as a global epidemic strain, binds more HBGAs than other strains, suggesting that the strength of transmission of GII/4 strains is related to the broad recognition of HBGAs [6] . The recognition sites on HBGAs by norovirus have been classified according to the interaction of the virus with the H, A, B, and Le epitopes ( Fig. 1 ) [6, 7] . HBGAs are important factors for determining host specificity, although it is still unclear whether HBGAs act as the primary receptor or enhance norovirus infectivity. Researchers including ourselves have demonstrated that feline calicivirus (FCV), a member of the genus Vesivirus, infects the upper respiratory tract by attaching to \u03b12-6linked sialic acids and using junctional adhesion molecule-1 for internalization [8, 9] . It is comparatively easy to study the life cycle of FCV because the virus replicates efficiently in cell culture without specific supplementation, whereas noroviruses are not cultivable in cell culture.",

            "text": "K. Kato et al. 43 best characterized [17] . Type 1 fimbriae consist of a major component (FimA) and a minor component (FimH) (Fig. 2) . FimH lies at the tip of type 1 fimbriae, where it mediates binding to D-mannose-containing structures and enables the bacteria to colonize various host tissues [18] . Type 1 fimbriae are also produced by other gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae [19] . The FimH protein of enterobacterial species including Salmonella recognizes mannose-containing oligosaccharides [18] . In the case of E. coli, previous reports have shown that FimH protein has a considerably high affinity for oligosaccharides containing Man\u03b11-3, such as Man\u03b11-3Man\u03b21-4GlcNAc and Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-3)Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-4)Man, which are constituents of cell surface glycoproteins [19] . The process of bacterial adhesion to the epithelial cell surface mediated by Type 1 fimbriae (FimH) is conservative among enterobacteria. Type 1 fimbriae are highly expressed on the bacterial surface, allowing large quantities of bacteria to adhere via the FimH-Mannose interaction (Fig. 3 ). Type 4 fimbriae are thin and flexible, and generally expressed at a lower level than type 1 fimbriae. Some type 4 fimbriae are only present at low levels on the surface of bacteria, and are localized at the bacterial pole. Although their expression level is low, type 4 fimbriae frequently play an important role in bacterial infection. Like type 1 fimbriae, type 4 fimbriae are thought to recognize carbohydrates as specific receptors, but the receptor molecules and precise functions of some type 4 fimbriae have yet to be determined. For example, the function of the type 4 fimbria bundle-forming pili (BFP), an important virulence factor for pathogenic E. coli strains, is not yet known (Fig. 2) . BFP may not be involved in initial adhesion; rather, it may participate in the formation of the bacterial colony by forming bundles that link one bacterium to another [20] . Although the function of and receptors for type 4 fimbriae remain unclear, bacterial virulence has been shown to decrease when type 4 fimbriae are deleted [16] . LPF medi- Salmonella and assortative bacteria express a variety of fimbriae. The minor component of Type 1 fimbriae, FimH, is present at the tip of type 1 fimbriae, mediates binding to D-mannose-containing structures and enables bacteria to colonize various host tissues [18] . Type 1 fimbria is highly expressed on the bacterial surface, allowing large amounts of bacteria to adhere via the FimH-mannose interaction. The various kinds of type 4 fimbriae play an important role in bacterial infection. Plasmid-encoded fimbria (PEF) is required for bacterial attachment to intestinal epithelial cells. PEF specifically binds to trisaccharide Gal\u03b21-4(Fuc\u03b11-3)GlcNAc, also known as the Lewis X (Le X ) blood group antigen [13] . Long polar fimbria (LPF) mediates the adhesion of S. typhimurium to murine Peyer's patches [21] . Extracellular matrix proteins (ECMs) may act as receptors for LPF. ECMs are modified with various carbohydrate moieties, and the presence of Mannose inhibits the LPF-ECM interaction. Mannose-containing carbohydrates may participate in bacterial adhesion via LPF [23] . Std fimbriae are categorized as \u03c0-fimbriae and are well conserved among S. enterica serotypes but absent from other related bacterial species. Std fimbriae recognize and bind the H type 2 histo-blood group oligosaccharide, the terminal Fuc\u03b11-2Gal\u03b21 moiety. S. typhi and S. paratifi can survive within the macrophages after they are engulfed by phagocytosis. Non-typhoidal Salmonella, S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, however, are unable to survive within macrophages.",

The variety of adhesion factors carried by a bacterium reflects its pathogenic profile, magnitude of virulence, host specificity, and tissue specificity. In the case of Salmonella and assortative bacteria, the FimH adhesins show amino acid sequence diversity. This diversity in FimH structure results in the variation in affinity profiles. E. coli FimH shows a high affinity for aromatic \u03b1mannosides as well as Man\u03b11-3 structures. On the other hand, the FimH of Salmonella species shows a high affinity for \u03b1-mannosides and a low affinity for aromatic \u03b1mannosides [19] . In the case of Salmonella, allelic variation of FimH adhesion directs not only host cellspecific recognition but also distinctive binding to mammalian and avian receptors. This allele-specific binding profile parallels the host specificity of the respective FimH-expressing pathogen [28] . Similarly, the Lewis b (Le b ) blood group phenotype in combination with secretor status may hinder colonization of Helicobacter pylori in certain populations [29] . H. pylori express blood group antigen b-binding adhesion (BabA), and BabA binds to Le b antigens. Salmonella and assortative bacteria contain various adhesion factors, including several kinds of fimbriae, which contribute to bacterial virulence; however, analyses of their specific receptor moieties and functions are not yet complete [13, 15] .",

The bacterial surface is covered with various kinds of carbohydrates. For gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella, the major carbohydrate component of the bacterial surface is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is categorized as a glycolipid, and is a major component of the bacterial outer membrane. Because the saccharide moieties of LPS differ structurally from mammalian carbohydrates, they function as targets of the host immune response. To avoid this host immune response, the LPS of some bacteria, for example C. jejuni, is structurally similar to the glycosphingolipids of gangliosides [30, 31] .

Gangliosides, i.e. sialic acidcontaining glycosphingolipids, are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic cell membranes that have been identified as receptors for bacterial toxins and viruses. An in vitro assay showed that a nonflagellated mutant of S. enteritidis, constructed by disrupting the fliC gene, was about 50-fold less invasive than the wild-type strain, but bacterial adherence was unaffected [33] . At the attachment of Salmonella enteritidis FliC to the host cell surface, gangliosides thus function as receptors.",

The ability of T. gondii to infect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells deficient in sialic acids was reduced by 26.9% compared to wild-type cells, indicating that sialic acid is critical for attachment and invasion of T. gondii (Fig. 4 ) [35] . T. gondii microneme protein 1 (TgMIC1) forms a macromolecular complex with TgMIC4 and TgMIC6. Single deletion of the TgMIC1 gene significantly decreases the invasion of host cells, suggesting an essential role for TgMIC1 in host cell attachment and invasion of T. gondii [36] . Structural analysis of TgMIC1 revealed a novel cellbinding motif called microneme adhesive repeat region (MARR), which provides a specialized structure for glycan discrimination [37] . Carbohydrate microarray analyses showed that TgMIC13, TgMIC1 and its homologue Neospora caninum MIC1 share a preference for \u03b12-3-over \u03b12-6-linked sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine sequences [38] . P104, a PAN/apple domain-containing protein expressed at the apical end of the extracellular parasite, functions as a ligand in the attachment of T. gondii to chondroitin sulfate and other receptors on the host cell, facilitating invasion by the parasite (Fig. 4) [39] .",

On the other hand, carbohydrates (glycoconjugates) can also function as a barrier to infection. On the surface of mucosal tissue, the glycocalyx physically prevents microbes from accessing the cell membrane. Some glycoconjugates, a component of the glycocalyx, contain carbohydrate structures that are recognized by pathogens. Mucins often contain oligosaccharide moieties that correspond to the receptor for various pathogens. On the surface of the mucosal layer, microbes binds to these receptor moieties and are captured at the mucus layer, which consequently blocks the infection. Moreover, when secretory mucins containing receptor carbohydrate structures \"trap\" pathogens, the pathogens are also carried away. M cells are specialized epithelial antigentransporting cells scattered in the follicle-associated epithelium that covers the gut lymphoid follicles such as Peyer's patches. M cells can efficiently engulf particles as large as bacteria; however, the mucus layer of M cells and the surrounding area is relatively thin. Glycoconjugates such as GP2 are expressed on the surface of M cells and function as receptors for bacterial attachment [74] . In the case of the host-parasite interaction, the various kinds of glycoconjugates sometimes function as receptors for the invading pathogens, but they can also function as barriers 48 Tropical Medicine and Health Vol. 43 No.1, 2015 and traps for the host defense system.",

Accordingly, when an anti-microbial drug is developed on the basis of the interaction between a microbe and a carbohydrate, host cell modification of the drug's structure and/or inhibition of the mode of infection will need to be individualized while still taking advantage of the similarities between interactions.",

Bacterial fimbriae and adhesins contribute to bacterial attachment, the initial step of bacterial infection. Each bacterial adhesin recognizes a specific structure of its target sugar molecule, and bacterial fimbriae also help to determine the specificity (species, tissue, or cell) of bacterial infection. Two types of representative fimbriae of Salmonella and assortative bacteria (Type 1 fimbriae and Type 4 fimbriae) are shown. Type 1 fimbriae are short and highly expressed entirely on the surface of bacteria. Type 4 fimbriae are thin and flexible, expressed at low levels, and are generally located at the polar part of bacteria. FimA and FimH are categorized as Type 1 fimbriae. Long-polar fimbriae (LPF), Plasmid-code fimbriae (PEF) and bundleforming pili (BFP) are categorized as Type 4 fimbriae.",
