However, evolutionary biologists have traditionally left most of the study of drug resistance to the medicine and epidemiology communities (Read & Huijben 2009 ). This has changed in recent years with interesting population genetic work being done on natural populations of pathogens, some of which is featured in this review. This change is, at least in part, driven by the availability of genetic data for a variety of pathogens. A new cross-disciplinary field is emerging that uses large amounts of genetic data and new theoretical advances from the world of population genetics. Some of this work is directly aimed at finding ways to prevent drug resistance evolution or spread, whereas other work is more basic in nature and mostly uses the pathogen as a model system to learn about evolution in general. In the best cases, we learn lessons on how to prevent resistance and on general evolutionary principles simultaneously.",

The current front-line treatment, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), was introduced in the 1990s at a time when all other drugs were failing. While ACTs were initially very effective, by 2003, the first signs of resistance to artemisinin emerged in South-East Asia, and now resistance is widespread (Noedl et al. 2008; Dondorp et al. 2009 Dondorp et al. , 2010 Kyaw et al. 2013; Ashley et al. 2014 ).",

Here, we review the population genetic methods used to identify the kelch gene on chromosome 13 conferring resistance to artemisinin-a locus that until recently had gone relatively unnoticed and whose biological function is still unknown-and the experimental methods used to confirm the causal mutations. We highlight P. falciparum in this review because it is a pathogen that experiences strong selective pressures and, unlike most human pathogens, it is a eukaryotic organism that experiences high rates of recombination (see Box 2). As we show, these properties of P. falciparum make it relatively straightforward to apply standard population genetics methods to malaria in order to detect selected sites with great success, even though these methods were often designed for other eukaryotic model organisms.",

This can result in a pattern of low genetic variation, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) and high haplotype homozygosity in the vicinity of the adaptive mutation. Plasmodium falciparum experiences a high rate of recombination [58 cM/Mb (Su et al. 1999; Jiang et al. 2011) There are several statistics that utilize LD and haplotype homozygosity information to identify selective sweeps, including extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH), cross population extended haplotype homozygosity (XP-EHH), as well as iHS, nSL and H12 (Sabeti et al. 2002 (Sabeti et al. , 2007 Voight et al. 2006; Ferrer-Admetlla et al. 2014; Garud et al. 2015) . EHH and XP-EHH have been particularly popular and successful in the detection of sites under selection in P. falciparum. EHH measures the decay in tracts of homozygosity radiating away from a SNP at a partial frequency in a single population (Sabeti et al. 2002) . However, EHH is not powerful in detecting a selective sweep that has gone to fixation (Sabeti et al. 2002) . In contrast, XP-EHH utilizes information from two populations, one where a sweep has presumably occurred, and another where a sweep has not (Sabeti et al. 2007) . XP-EHH is thus powerful in detecting partial and complete sweeps that have occurred in one of the two populations considered. In addition to LDbased statistics, there are several site frequency spectrum (SFS) statistics which treat individual polymorphic sites in a sample independently from one another. Statistics such as Tajima's D (Tajima 1989) , Fay and Wu's H (Fay & Wu 2000; Fay et al. 2002) , and Sweepfinder (Nielsen et al. 2005 ) are sensitive to dips in neutral diversity and excesses in low and high frequency polymorphisms in the SFS (Braverman et al. 1995; Vitti et al. 2013) . Another widely used SFS statistic is F ST (Lewontin & Krakauer 1973) , which compares genomic patterns between two populations. More specifically, F ST measures the difference in average pairwise diversity measured in randomly sampled individuals across two different populations vs. within a single population, and can thus be an indicator of positive selection if one population diverges extremely in diversity from another. As we explain in this review, F ST has been successfully used in conjunction with EHH and XP-EHH to detect selected sites in P. falciparum across multiple populations.",

Association tests correlate a phenotype with the allelic states of polymorphisms in a sample from a single population (Anderson et al. 2011 ). In the case of P. falciparum, artemisinin resistance is characterized by slow parasite clearance rates, measured as the rate of decay in parasite density in the blood over time (Noedl et al. 2008; Dondorp et al. 2009 ). Therefore, this phenotype is used in studies to identify the underlying mutations conferring resistance to artemisinin. Association studies can result in many false positives because of a number of confounding factors such as population substructure and relatedness between individuals in a sample. Furthermore, association studies can be computationally slow in large sample sizes with large numbers of polymorphic sites. Efficient mixed models association (EMMA) is an association technique that aims to address these factors (Kang et al. 2008 ).",

Close examination of the genomic signatures immediately surrounding these loci reveals patterns of reduced diversity, elevated linkage disequilibrium (LD), and the presence of long haplotypes at high frequency (Wootton et al. 2002; Nair et al. 2003; Roper et al. 2004; Vinayak et al. 2010) , all of which are associated with signatures of selective sweeps (Maynard Smith & Haigh 1974; Kaplan et al. 1989; Kim & Stephan 2002) . The distinct genomic signatures resulting from drug resistance in P. falciparum suggest that novel loci conferring resistance to artemisinin can be discovered by searching for patterns of elevated LD and haplotype homozygosity. In Box 2, we discuss some of the popular population genomic methods used to identify selective sweeps and resistant loci in P. falciparum, including LD statistics such as XP-EHH (Sabeti et al. 2007) , SFS statistics used to corroborate findings made with LD statistics, such as F ST (Lewontin & Krakauer 1973) and genomewide association studies.",

            "text": "In the first major study, Cheeseman et al. (2012) examined genomic data from samples from three populations: Laos, Thailand and Cambodia, where resistance is observed only in Thailand and Cambodia (Cheeseman et al. 2012) . This data set offered the opportunity to contrast the Thai and Cambodia samples with Laos to discover putative loci conferring resistance to artemisinin. Cheeseman et al. (2012) utilized a two-step approach to identify genomic regions underlying resistance to artemisinin. First, the authors used the XP-EHH (Sabeti et al. 2007 ) and F ST (Lewontin & Krakauer 1973) statistics and identified 33 regions as significant candidates under selection in at least one population. These statistics were particularly appropriate for their multipopulation data set because they are designed to contrast genomic signatures in two populations (Box 2). Cheeseman et al. (2012) found that (Kang et al. 2008) to test the association of each SNP in their data set and the parasite clearance phenotype, thereby identifying four SNPs significantly associated, including two on chromosome 13. In conjunction with the association test, Takala-Harrison et al. (2013) applied XP-EHH (Sabeti et al. 2007 ) and F ST (Lewontin & Krakauer 1973) to the Cambodia population, using the Thai and Bangladeshi populations as comparison populations. The authors found that only the polymorphisms on chromosome 13 previously identified with the EMMA test also had significant XP-EHH and F ST values. Takala-Harrison et al. (2013) used HAPLOVIEW (Barrett et al. 2005) to visualize the extended haplotype homozygosity in the region. Miotto et al. (2013) examined 10 locations in West Africa and South-East Asia and found that there was an exceptionally high amount of population substructure within Cambodia. Upon closer examination, the authors found that three of four clusters of P. falciparum found in western Cambodia showed slow parasite clearance rates, slow decay in LD, and loss of haplotype diversity, while the fourth cluster prevalent in northeastern Cambodia did not show any of these characteristics. This leads the authors to conclude that western Cambodia harbours at least three distinct populations of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum. In particular, one of the subpopulations with resistant strains of P. falciparum showed a single haplotype extending across half of chromosome 13, corroborating the evidence from Cheeseman et al. (2012) and Takala-Harrison et al. (2013) that this locus is implicated in resistance to artemisinin.",

Ghorbal et al.

            "text": "Of the five examples reviewed in this study, this example of using classic statistical methods to find the association between the kelch gene and artimisinin resistance in P. falciparum is perhaps the most familiar to population geneticists. As a eukaryotic pathogen with a high rate of recombination, sequence analysis of the P. falciparum genome was amenable to traditional genome scan approaches. Clever stratification of the samples gave additional power to the genomic scans, and in combination with novel experimental methods, researchers were able to find a locus under recent strong selection that was responsible for the evolution of resistance to artimisinin. The identification of the kelch gene by population genetics methods offers a clear example where standard methodologies to identify selective sweeps are powerful in identifying a causal locus. Given that P. falciparum can be manipulated experimentally to confirm computational predictions, this organism is an attractive choice for future studies of drug resistance, especially since malaria continues to be a costly disease and new drug-resistant loci may be unknown.",

            "text": "Annual influenza epidemics are estimated to result in 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 250 000-500 000 deaths worldwide (WHO 2014b). Subtypes of the influenza type A virus are named according to the two surface proteins that allow influenza virus to bind and release from host cells, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). For example, H1N1 designates the particular subtype of influenza that was responsible for the 2009 swine flu epidemic. These two surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are primary antigenic targets for the immune system and are also potential targets for pharmaceutical intervention. One common influenza drug is oseltamivir, which is marketed under the trade name Tamiflu. Oseltamivir works by inhibiting the influenza neuraminidase surface protein, the protein that cleaves sialic acid from the receptor of the host cell and allows replicated virus to spread to other uninfected cells (Moscona 2005) . Resistance to oseltamivir in N1containing influenza is conferred by a single histidine-to-tyrosine amino acid change at the 275th amino acid position in the neuraminidase protein. Note that this amino acid is often referred to as amino acid 274, which is its position in N2, a convention which we will follow here. The H274Y mutation was known from laboratory studies, but researchers predicted that fitness costs would prevent H274Y from spreading widely. However, oseltamivir resistance due to the H274Y mutation has been documented extensively following the 2007-2008 flu season when global surveillance indicated the increasing prevalence of H1N1 influenza viruses with acquired resistance (Moscona 2009) . A combination of phylogenetics and elegant laboratory studies led to the discovery of two permissive mutations that mitigated the cost of the H274Y mutation, thus showing the importance of epistasis for influenza evolution. The study of the evolution of oseltamivir resistance has relied heavily on phylogenetic methods and taught us about the importance of epistasis, which, in turn, is of crucial importance for making predictions on influenza evolution.",

Epistasis in drug resistance evolution has been characterized by several in vitro studies, including the case of the five interacting mutations involved in cefotaxime resistance in Escherichia coli that produce predictable mutation orders (Weinreich et al. 2006 ) and the hundreds of interacting mutations that determine viral fitness in antiretroviral resistance in HIV (Hinkley et al. 2011 ).",

This led researchers to believe that viruses carrying H274Y were 'unlikely to be of clinical consequence' (Ives et al. 2002) . Why then did the resistant H1N1 strains subsequently reach a global frequency of nearly 95% (WHO 2009) during the 2008-2009 flu season? Bloom and others showed that the H274Y mutation reduces the amount of folded neuramindase that reaches the host cell surface and thereby reduces the virus' fitness. They hypothesized that secondary mutations at other sites in the influenza genome may have acted to ameliorate deleterious effects of the H274Y mutation, permitting it to reach high global frequency (Bloom et al. 2010 ).",

In viruses that had these two mutations, H274Y no longer reduced the fitness of the virus.

Taken together these results suggest that epistasis had a profound impact on the evolution of resistance to oseltamivir and allowed the H274Y resistance mutation to spread through the global population. This work also provides cautionary evidence for the clinical assessment of drug resistance mutations. Secondary mutations that interact epistatically with drug resistance mutations are important factors that need to be incorporated when making predictions about the epidemiological consequences of drug resistance mutations. Knowing that even deleterious drug resistance mutations can spread when they emerge on permissive backgrounds tells us that we should pay close attention to identifying and monitoring potential epistatic interactions during virological surveillance.",

If SGV is critically important in the establishment of drug resistance, efforts should be focused on identifying any potential drug resistance mutations in the pretreatment HIV population to determine an appropriate regimen. However, if resistance occurs de novo after the start of treatment, patient adherence, drug penetrance and dosage should be the clinical focus. To this end, it is important to understand whether drug resistance mutations present before treatment onset can be identified in patient samples, and to assess the ultimate contribution of SGV to treatment failure.",

First, every infected person is an independent evolutionary replicate, and transmitted drug resistance is relatively rare. Around 2.8-11.5% of untreated patients have transmitted drug resistance mutations depending on the region of the world , although these numbers are lower when considering drug resistance to any specific treatment. Therefore, most drug resistance emerges independently within a patient, and it is sufficient to follow a single patient over time to chart the evolution of an HIV population, in contrast to monitoring the acquisition of drug resistance mutations across multiple patients in a transmission chain. Second, the mutations conferring drug resistance are well catalogued (Bennett et al. 2009; Wensing et al. 2014 ), allowing us to quantify their frequency prior to treatment using allele-specific PCR (asPCR). Finally, adaptation can be rapid, allowing us to observe the evolution of drug resistance as it happens.",

Sanger sequencing of HIV before the start of treatment is standard in clinical practice, but next-generation sequencing is not (Simen et al. 2009; Codo\u00f1er et al. 2011) . A sequence of the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase genes are used to determine whether any drug resistance mutations are present at high frequencies, and if so, these results help the clinician and patient choose a combination of drugs with which to start treatment (Hirsch et al. 2008 ). If the majority of the viral population in a patient carries a resistance mutation, then this information will be used to choose a drug regimen that will work for the specific virus. However, drug resistance mutations at low population frequencies (at 20% or less) are not detected by standard sequencing protocols (Simen et al. 2009 ). An important question therefore is whether this low-frequency SGV is present in most patients, and if so, whether it allows the viral population to adapt and evolve drug resistance.",

These patients originally took part in a clinical trial, so blood samples from before the start of treatment and at treatment failure (if applicable) were stored for them. Treatment failure is defined as having virus detectable in the blood at levels higher than should be expected given that the patient is on treatment. The authors focused on two important resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene, K103N and Y181C, because the patients were treated with a combination of reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In 73 of the 183 patients, they found that either K103N or Y181C was already present as a minority variant (mostly around 1% frequency), but they could not detect the mutation in the other 110 patients. Of the patients with the minority variant, treatment failed in 26 but was successful in 47. Out of the patients without the minority variants, treatment failed in only 16 but was successful in 94. Altogether, treatment failed in 23% of the 183 patients. When only considering the patients without detectable SGV, treatment failed in 15% of the patients. This means that in 8% of the patients, failure can be attributed to the presence of a minority variant (see Fig. 4 ).",

We re-analysed data from a previous study (Margot et al. 2006 ) and looked for excess adaptation early during treatment. We found that in the study of interest, resistance evolution happened at a constant rate in the second and third year of treatment. In both of those years, the virus acquired resistance in 3.5% of the patients who previously had a virus without drug resistance. Such a constant rate of evolution of drug resistance was also observed in several other trials (e.g. UK Collaborative Group on HIV Drug Resistance and UK CHIC Study Group and Others 2010). In years 2 and 3 of treatment, SGV that was present before treatment probably plays no role, so the 3.5% likely reflects evolution of resistance from de novo mutations. In the first year of treatment, it is expected that both new mutations and SGV contribute to the evolution of resistance, so if resistance evolved in more than 3.5% of the patients' viral populations, this suggests that SGV played a role.",

In populations with no recombination, each mutation remains on the genetic background on which it originally occurred. Therefore, if multiple positively selective traits enter the population simultaneously on different backgrounds, these traits cannot be recombined to augment each other.

Although there is evidence that HIV experiences clonal interference within patients, recombination complicates its study (Pandit & de Boer 2014) . There is also a strong interest in clonal evolution in cancer, but sampling at different time points is often much harder for cancer than for M. tuberculosis or HIV, which makes cancer as a study system more difficult Walter et al. 2012 ).",

            "text": "Intrahost evolution of M. tuberculosis provides a fairly straightforward way to examine clonal interference in vivo and to understand the extent to which it can slow the evolutionary process. Because there is no recombination, allele frequencies from pooled resequencing can, in some cases, be reconstructed into haplotypes (see below). Its large genome size (~4.5 Mb), well-documented drug resistance mutations, and long time course of infection mean that patterns of diversity can be tracked over time. Although previous studies have shown the presence of competing clonal lineages in M. tuberculosis populations in a patient using neutral markers (Al-Hajoj et al. 2010; Navarro et al. 2011 ), we can further use our understanding of drug resistance mutations to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of within-host populations. Among patients who are infected with drug-sensitive strains of M. tuberculosis, drug resistance can evolve within a patient during treatment. By tracking the frequencies of drug resistance mutations over time in a single patient, we can observe clonal interference between lineages that each carry beneficial mutations in real time. Sun et al. (2012) conducted the first analysis of this kind by tracking drug resistance allele frequencies in three patients across at least two time points. The first patient was entirely free of drug resistance mutations at the onset of treatment, but by the second time point of sampling had four segregating drug resistance mutations. At the final time point, 94% of the sample had a single drug resistance mutation, and 6% was divided among other drugresistant strains, including those containing drug resistance mutations not present at the second time point. This suggests that while M. tuberculosis rapidly acquires resistance mutations, different drug-resistant strains compete against each other due to lack of recombination. The second patient entered the study with an M. tuberculosis population fixed for a certain drug resistance mutation (rpoB L533P) but remained sensitive to the antibiotic rifampicin. Eighteen months later, this patient had a population whose genetic composition was dominated by a different drug resistance mutation (rpoB H526Y) and was now resistant to rifampicin, suggesting that successive sweeps of alternative drug resistance mutations can lead to multidrug-resistant strains. Eldholm et al. (2014) performed a similar study, but with much greater sequencing depth, in a single patient who was followed over 42 months as extensive drug resistance was acquired by the pathogen. The patient, who was started on a standard antibiotic regimen (pyrazinamide, rifampicin and isoniazid), was given increasingly uncommon drugs as their tuberculosis population acquired more drug resistance mutations. The dynamics of clonal interference are shown in Fig. 5 , based on data from Eldholm et al. (2014) . Allele frequencies were measured at several time points, so alleles with similar frequency trajectories can be assumed to be on the same background or in the same clone. Therefore, the clonal frequency changes can be inferred across time. Eldholm et al. (2014) identified 12 drug resistance mutations reaching frequency >25%, of which only seven ultimately fixed (shown in green), suggesting that clonal interference may purge over 40% of strongly selected drug resistance mutations even after reaching high frequencies (shown in blue).",

Although we currently only have detailed data for a few well-studied patients that include deep coverage of the entire genome across multiple time points, it appears to be the case that clonal interference in M. tuberculosis populations occurs in a way that is similar to what is seen in laboratory experiments. With the knowledge of hundreds of drug resistance mutations and the availability of affordable whole-genome sequencing, we expect to see many more studies of within-host dynamics of tuberculosis in the near future.

Most bacterial species primarily reproduce clonally, passing their current genomes vertically to the next generation. In species with HGT, there are also genetic elements that can be passed between individuals within the current generation and recombined into their genomes. HGT can move genes, sets of genes or even chromosomes between cells of even distantly related species (Nelson et al. 1999; Keeling & Palmer 2008; Syvanen 2012; Meric et al. 2015) . This makes defining a bacterial species difficult, let alone tracking the spread of drug resistance.",

Many species of bacteria have an additional 'accessory' or 'satellite' genome that is typically 0.1-10% of the size of the core genome and can be present on the main circular chromosome or on extrachromosomal elements, such as plasmids. The core genome is usually defined as the set of genetic regions that are present within all members of the species, and the accessory genome is that which can vary between individual strains or cells. The accessory genome, whether on the main chromosome or not, can include chromosomal cassettes, bacteriophages, pathogenicity islands, genomic islands and transposons (Lindsay & Holden 2004) . The accessory genome is sometimes called 'dispensable' because it is not required for survival in an optimal environment; however, not only can the accessory genome encode information essential to a bacterium's survival in some environments, but bacteria have evolved elaborate and fascinating methods of sharing accessory genes between cells (Amabile-Cuevas 1993; Stokes & Gillings 2011) .",

            "text": "The sharing of genetic information between cells is called horizontal gene transfer (HGT). While bacteria are asexual and typically defined as 'clonal', both HGT (distinct from sex because it alters the genome of the recipient) and new mutations can generate novel genetic variation within a population of bacteria. HGT can occur both within and across species, and there are even cases of transfer across kingdoms (Keeling & Palmer 2008) . The actual methods of transferring DNA through the cell membrane include transformation, transduction, and conjugation. Transformation is the uptake of naked DNA into the cell, generally mediated by membrane proteins with some DNA specificity. It is a method restricted to species that have evolved to uptake DNA. Transduction is transfer of DNA that is mediated by phages (or bacteriophages, viruses that infect and replicate within a bacterium), thus it is restricted by which hosts a phage is capable of infecting. There are two types: generalized transduction, where random bacterial DNA is incorporated into phage DNA, and specialized transduction, where the incorporation is limited to a specific set of bacterial genes. Perhaps the most common method of HGT is conjugation, which requires cell-to-cell contact. One famous method of conjugation is the E. coli F conjugative plasmids, which code for cellular structures that bring the cells into contact (called 'pili') as well as for machinery to inject the DNA into the recipient cell. The genetic material transferred via HGT can be recombined onto the main bacterial chromosome or onto extrachromosomal elements. Often 'cassettes' of genes evolve together and can spread through a bacterial population, including in many cases of drug resistance (Amabile-Cuevas 1993; Stokes & Gillings 2011).",

            "text": "One useful framework for understanding the spread of drug resistance in species with HGT is the concept of a selective sweep. In general, in a selective sweep, a new adaptive mutation arises and spreads through a population, causing a corresponding reduction in genetic diversity around the adaptive site (Maynard Smith & Haigh 1974) . In clonal populations (e.g. populations of M. tuberculosis), a selective sweep can lead to the removal of entire lineages and a strong genomewide reduction in diversity. By contrast, in recombining populations (e.g. populations of P. falciparum) the extent of the reduction in diversity is inversely proportional to the ratio of recombination and selection, r/s [such that the greatest reduction in diversity occurs when recombination (r) is weak and selection (s) is strong] (Kaplan et al. 1989) . Selective sweeps in organisms that exhibit HGT can be best understood by distinguishing between gene-specific and genomewide selective sweeps (Shapiro & Polz 2014) . Gene-specific selective sweeps occur when an adaptive mutation or gene can be transmitted across a population faster via HGT than by clonal expansion, which means that the adaptive mutation spreads independent of the rest of the genome. Perhaps more familiarly, a genomewide selective sweep occurs when an adaptive mutation spreads via clonal expansion of the genome that first acquired the adaptive mutation. Another way to frame gene-specific and genomewide selective sweeps can be to think again of the ratio of recombination (here mediated via HGT) to selection, r/s, and how it impacts genetic variation in the genome. When r/s \u226b 1 gene-specific selective sweeps are more likely to occur, and they will have little impact on genomewide diversity. When r/s \u226a 1 genomewide selective sweeps are more likely, and genomic diversity can be strongly reduced. Thus far, it appears that many adaptive events in microbial species with HGT may fall into the r/s \u226b 1 regime which leads to gene-specific sweeps (Shapiro & Polz 2014) , although more data are needed. For example, what looks to be a high r/s ratio may be partially be explained by the slowing of genomewide sweeps due to clonal interference and perhaps selection for lowfrequency genotypes (Shapiro & Polz 2014) . Nevertheless, it is useful to frame the evolution of bacterial species with HGT in the context of both genomewide and gene-specific sweeps.",

We will use the example of S aureus and the accessory element SCCmec to explore the evolution of drug resistance within a bacterial species capable of horizontal gene transfer (note that SCCmec recombines onto the circular chromosome as a gene cassette, see Boxes 1 and 3). We have chosen to consider MRSA not only because it is a major emerging health threat but also because it is an instructive example in how the phylogenetic relationships between global isolates reveal different evolutionary histories depending on whether the core genome or an accessory genetic element is considered.",

MRSA can be particularly deadly. For example, mortality rates for patients with MRSA bloodstream infections has been reported to be ~30% (De Kraker et al. 2011 ). In the USA ~94 000 infections and ~19 000 deaths per year are caused by MRSA (Stockman 2009 ). Drug resistance can arise via new mutations within the genome of a single clone (Strahilevitz & Hooper 2005; Howden et al. 2008) , via horizontal gene transfer between clones (Coombs et al. 2011 ) and even via horizontal gene transfer from another bacterial species (Hanssen & Ericson Sollid 2006; Bloemendaal et al. 2010; Malachowa & Deleo 2010; Smyth et al. 2012) .

The most common method for analysing the genomes of S. aureus isolates has been multilocus sequence typing (MLST), in which a standardized set of housekeeping genes from the core genome are sequenced and categorized into allelic types, allowing placement of each isolate into a defined 'clonal complex' (Enright & Day 2000; Enright et al. 2002; Maiden et al. 2014 ). MLST has historically been applied to the core genome, revealing that S. aureus is a highly clonal species with relatively few recombination events in the core genome (Robinson & Enright 2004 ). When MLST is applied to international collections of isolates, it appears that a small number of clonal lineages are responsible for most infections. For example, Oliveira et al. (2002) applied MLST to over 3000 MRSA isolates from hospitals across Europe, South America, and the USA, and found that just five clones caused 70% of the infections (Oliveira et al. 2002) . As findings such as these emerged, it was thought that methicillin resistance was likely to have spread across the population of S. aureus when relatively few clones acquired SCCmec and then clonally expanded (i.e. genomewide sweeps) (Kreiswirth et al. 1993; Cris\u00f3stomo et al. 2001; Feil & Enright 2004 ).

HA-MRSA tends to be resistant to a wider array of antibiotics and often causes blood stream and other hospital-related infections in individuals with additional medical conditions. CA-MRSA tends to be more virulent (caused by virulence genes also transmitted via HGT) and often causes skin infections in otherwise healthy individuals (David & Daum 2010; Chua et al. 2014) . These clinical differences are partly mediated by the mobile genetic element called SCCmec, a chromosomal gene cassette that confers resistance to methicillin and can also confer resistance to other antibiotics (Katayama et al. 2000; Hanssen & Ericson Sollid 2006) . Interestingly, genetic changes within this gene cassette track successive epidemic waves of MRSA (Katayama et al. 2000; Chambers & DeLeo 2009) , and extensive work has been done to investigate the source and spread of this mobile element, both as a phylogenetically informative sequence and as an adaptive factor in its own right. SCCmec is currently classified into 11 types (with more subtypes) using mutations and the orientation of segments within the cassette (Milheiri\u00e7o et al. 2007; IWG-SCC 2015) .",

Both HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA strains are thought to arise when methicillin-sensitive clones newly acquire a SCCmec cassette from a source population, most likely the staphylococcus species S. epidermidis (Wu et al. 1996; Hanssen et al. 2004 Hanssen et al. , 2005 Meric et al. 2015) . It has been found that HA-MRSA strains tend to carry the longer SCCmec types I, II, and III elements in just a few clonal backgrounds, whereas CA-MRSA strains tends to carry the shorter SCCmec types IV and V elements in diverse clonal backgrounds (Enright et al. 2002; Robinson & Enright 2003; David & Daum 2010; Coombs et al. 2011) . For example, the early HA-MRSA pandemic could be relatively neatly classified into just five clonal complexes (Musser & Kapur 1992; Fitzgerald et al. 2001; Enright et al. 2002; Robinson & Enright 2003) . In contrast, as researchers began analysing the strains responsible for the emerging CA-MRSA health threat, they found these strains to display more diversity and a stronger association between clonal type and geographic location (Chua et al. 2010; David & Daum 2010; Coombs et al. 2011) . As of 2006 the SCCmec type IV element alone was found to have entered at least nine different clonal complexes of S. aureus (Lina et al. 2006 ).",

A study of MRSA infections in 2004 MRSA infections in -2005 in the city of San Francisco, California, found that ~90% of MRSA infections were acquired in the community (Liu et al. 2008 ). In the United States, there is currently a predominant CA-MRSA clone, called USA300 (typically containing SCCmec Type IV), that is responsible for the vast majority of community-associated infections in addition to causing hospital outbreaks (Seybold et al. 2006; Chambers & DeLeo 2009 ). Mathematical models predict that these CA-MRSA strains will eventually replace the strains traditionally categorized as HA-MRSA, rendering the communityassociated and hospital-associated categories far less useful (D'Agata et al. 2009 ). The success of these CA-MRSA strains is potentially mediated by the arrival of the SCCmec Type IV cassette, which may be particularly suited to recurrent horizontal transfer because it confers faster growth rates at little or no fitness cost (Okuma et al. 2002; Diep et al. 2008; Chambers & DeLeo 2009; Mediavilla et al. 2012 ).",

Instead, attention is moving towards leveraging new sequencing technologies (Maiden et al. 2014 ) to achieve higher resolution into the global patterns of methicillin resistance acquisition. Overall, analyses of the core genome of MRSA strains suggest that relatively few methicillin-resistant clones have dispersed widely across the globe (Robinson & Enright 2003) , while analyses of the accessory genome of MRSA suggest that new strains emerge locally via frequent de novo transfers of the SCCmec element. In other words, it appears that there has been clonal expansion of relatively few core genomes, while the accessory genome frequently goes through gene-specific sweeps. To illustrate this, Lina et al. (2006) applied MLST to both the core genome and the SCCmec element and found no association between clonal complex background and SCCmec element sequence type. The authors therefore concluded that SCCmec appears to transfer both repeatedly across distinct clonal complexes (particularly in the case of SCCmec IV) and repeatedly within a clonal complex, which suggests that SCCmec spreads through gene-specific sweeps. Chua et al. showed in another study that MRSA from geographically and genetically distant isolates (i.e. distantly related core genomes) can nevertheless have relatively conserved accessory elements, including SCCmec type IV (Chua et al. 2011) , which again suggests that transfer happens often and sweeps are gene-specific. Another example is a study by N\u00fcbel et al. (2008) where the authors used an improved sequence typing method of the core and accessory genome to investigate the genetic relationships within a single clonal lineage (ST5, belonging to clonal complex CC5) using 135 isolates from across 22 countries and six continents. In contrast to lower resolution studies that came before, their analyses of the core genome sequences found geographically-associated phylogenetic clades within the ST5 clonal lineage. Additionally, their analyses of the SCCmec sequence revealed that at least 23 independent transfers of SCCmec occurred into this clonal group alone, with acquisitions appearing to occur locally (rather than a single acquisition then disseminating globally; Fig. 6 ). We could refer to this case of multiple origins of the adaptive SCCmec element as a soft, gene-specific sweep (Pennings & Hermisson 2006) . The authors estimate that previous calculations for the rate of SCCmec acquisitions were at least an order of magnitude too low.",

Thus, the growing availability of sequence data and whole-genome sequencing technologies has provided the ability to determine that resistance may generally be unconstrained by global transmission dynamics and instead can be tracked on local spatial scales. This presents researchers with the opportunity to use sequencing as a tool to monitor transmission networks within hospitals to limit the numbers of hospital-acquired drug-resistant infections.

It is therefore important that tools from the field of evolutionary genetics, including population genetic and phylogenetic ones, are applied to pathogen populations where these tools could provide meaningful insights. In addition to the possibility of helping to prevent the evolution and spread of drug resistance, valuable lessons can be learned to deepen our understanding of evolutionary biology, making pathogens attractive study organisms. In this review we highlighted five evolutionary genetic studies in pathogens that we hope give a sampling of the range of biological lessons that can be learned from the study of drug resistance in pathogens. First, we showed how classic population genetic methods for finding selective sweeps were used to successfully identify the region involved with resistance to artemisinin in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Next, we described how phylogenetic methods helped uncover the role of epistasis in the evolution of influenza surface proteins in general and in the evolution of oseltamivir resistance in particular. In our third example, we highlighted the importance of SGV in the evolution of resistance to antiretrovirals in patients with HIV. Fourth, we showed that drug resistance mutations can be used to explore the dynamics of clonal interference within a patient infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Finally, we discussed the complications involved in studying bacterial populations and how horizontal gene transfer of genetic elements contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.",

The insights gained from these examples are not limited to the organisms mentioned in this review, but the discoveries that can be made do, in some ways, depend on the organism, its biology, and the availability of data. For example, the work on epistasis in influenza was only possible because of the extensive sequence collection that is continuously happening around the world. The work on mapping a resistance allele in the malaria parasite P. falciparum also depended on the availability of data but additionally was possible because P. falciparum has a high recombination rate that facilitates linkage-based analyses. The described studies on SGV in HIV were possible because the relevant mutations were known and because evolution of resistance can happen independently in every patient, giving researchers the ability to work with replicate evolutionary histories. The work in M. tuberculosis was possible, once again, because the resistance mutations are well known and because haplotypes could be reconstructed from allele frequencies due to a lack of recombination. Finally, the example of drug resistance evolution in MRSA shows how horizontal gene transfer can be studied when extensive multilocus genotyping data are available from isolates collected across the globe.",

We used MRSA as an example for the importance of horizontal gene transfer, but there are many other such examples. For example, a recent study on pneumococcus describes horizontal gene transfer and soft selective sweeps related to drug resistance and vaccine escape (Croucher et al. 2014) . Another example of a group of pathogens in which the evolution of drug resistance can be studied are the herpes viruses. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the herpes virus for which drug resistance is best studied and for which many resistance mutations are known (Hakki & Chou 2011) , and population geneticists have recently started to analyse CMV sequences (Renzette et al. 2015) .

Some pathogens already function as model organisms in the lab [e.g., influenza (Foll et al. 2014) , HIV (van Opijnen & Berkhout 2005) , polio (Acevedo et al. 2014 ) and E. coli (Toprak et al. 2012 )], which allows researchers to assess characteristics of population genetic and epidemiological relevance from laboratory populations, for example the cell surface expression assays that were performed in the previously mentioned study of oseltamivir resistance in influenza. In some pathogen systems, researchers can also apply known selective pressures with precision in a laboratory environment, thus allowing high-resolution measurements of an organism's response to selection. Additionally, because some pathogens evolve drug resistance quickly and repeatedly within patients, there are cases where many replicate evolutionary histories can be studied (HIV, HCV, TB, etc.).",

Moreover, decreased costs of next-generation sequencing will make the amount of new data for pathogens increase exponentially. Throughout this review, we highlight uses of sequence data and population genetics theory in studying pathogens as evolutionary model systems. We believe that pathogen evolution will continue to be a fruitful area of research for evolutionary biologists where fundamental insights can lead to beneficial public health consequences.",

            "text": "As more sequencing data emerge in the foreseeable future, there are some specific questions that we would like to see addressed at the intersection of population genetics and drug resistance in pathogens. First, we are expecting more work that bridges within-vs. betweenhost dynamics (e.g. Lythgoe & Fraser 2012) . This is important because considerable genetic variation is created and selected for within the host; however, the within-host processes of short-lived infections have not yet received sufficient attention. We are expecting more within-host work, including time series and deep samples for pathogens that are traditionally studied at the between-host level. The M. tuberculosis work described in this review is a good example, but new within-patient work on influenza is also being done (Rogers et al. 2015) . Second, with deeper samples and more time series, it should become increasingly possible to estimate selection pressures on pathogens and to estimate epistatic interactions between mutations. For some of this work, methods that are currently used for identifying mutations and evaluating selection in viruses grown in cell culture (Lou et al. 2013; Foll et al. 2014 ) will hopefully find use in clinical samples taken from infected patients. Extending these methods to patient data can potentially give researchers the ability to study the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens within patients over the entire course of an infection.",

Until very recently predicting evolution seemed like science fiction, but recent work is changing our perceptions of what is possible. In addition to the predictive phylogenetic methodologies mentioned in our discussion of epistasis in influenza, a method that uses the shapes of protein phylogenies to predict evolutionary trajectories was evaluated using influenza data (Neher et al. 2014) . The work shows that predictability is low when evolution occurs by big steps, but much higher when evolution proceeds by small steps (Neher et al. 2014 ). Although we tend to fix our attention on large adaptive events, such as drug resistance or immune escape, evolution by small steps may be more common than previously expected (Bhatt et al. 2011; Strelkowa & L\u00e4ssig 2012; Gong et al. 2013) . In an organism like influenza where new vaccines are manufactured every year, the application of these and other new predictive methodologies that use population genetics theory (Luksza & L\u00e4ssig 2014) are potentially groundbreaking.",

Phylogenetic tree of neuraminidase (NA) subtype N1 illustrating the role of permissive mutations. Tree made with PhyML (Guindon et al. 2010 ) based on data from Bloom et al. (2010) and plotted using ggtree (Yu & Lam 2015) . The phylogeny suggests an epistatic interaction between mutations R222Q, V234M and H274Y. Based on a maximum-likelihood reconstruction, branches with the H274Y resistance mutation are coloured red, whereas those without are coloured grey. Nonresistant branches with only the V234M mutation are coloured in light blue while nonresistant branches with both V234M and R222Q mutations are coloured in dark blue. The clade in which mutations, R222Q and V234M, are nearly fixed is shaded in blue. The phylogeny is consistent with the idea that the substitutions at site 222 and 234 act as 'permissive' mutations, ameliorating the fitness costs of H274Y on the previous background and allowing it to spread.

The same tree from Fig. 2 is used to illustrate the methodology presented in Kryazhimskiy et al. (2011) . Nonresistant branches with the D344N mutation are coloured in blue. Branches with the H274Y resistance mutation are coloured in red. The phylogeny suggests an epistatic interaction between sites 344 and 275 where the H274Y substitution at site 275 (site 274 in N2 numbering scheme) appears multiple times immediately following the D344N substitution at site 344 (shaded in blue). This co-occurrence is consistent with the idea that the substitution at site 344 acts as a 'permissive' mutation and that these mutations interact in a positively epistatic manner. Determining the amount of drug resistance from standing genetic variation (SGV) in HIV-1 using two studies. In two different studies, the percentage of patients acquiring drug resistance is partitioned into those whose HIV populations acquired drug resistance from SGV (light blue) and those whose populations acquired drug resistance via de novo mutation (dark blue). The total rate of failure is higher in the Paredes study than in the Margot study, but the percentage that is attributable to SGV is similar in the two studies. The calculation of the percentage of patients failing from SGV from the Paredes et al. (2010) study is shown in the inset. Patients are partitioned into those starting without drug-resistant SGV (left) and those with drug-resistant SGV (right). Eleven patients are expected to have failed due to de novo mutations based on the sample size (15% of 73 patients), and the remaining 15 failures are attributed to failure due to drug resistance from SGV. Clonal interference in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Dynamics of clonal interference among drug resistance mutations (stars) and mutations not known to be drug resistance mutations (dots) arising within a patient with tuberculosis. Each expanding colour block represents an M. tuberculosis lineage starting from one or more mutations and spreading through the population. Lineages are coloured depending on whether the mutations they possess ultimately fix in the population (green) or are lost (blue). Lineages that begin with mutations not known to be drug resistance mutations (non-DRMs) are coloured in brown. The background on which each new lineage emerges is overlapped at the starting point of each colour block. Trajectories are inferred from allele frequencies at the point of sampling (black vertical lines). Mutations for which the inferred trajectories do not closely match clonal dynamics are marked in red. Data from Eldholm et al. (2014) . sizes of circles are proportional to the haplotype frequency, and the line length is proportional to the number of mutational steps between haplotypes. In panel (A) haplotypes are painted with colours in proportion to the country of origin that isolates with this haplotype were found. Fourteen lineages (labelled 'A' through 'N') tend to cluster with geographical origin emerge, suggesting that specific haplotypes of the core genome of the S. aureus ST5 clone are largely endemic to a geographical area. In panel (B) the same minimum-spanning tree is used, but now haplotypes are painted with colours in proportion to the SCCmec element type co-occurring in the isolate. Some SCCmec elements are nontypeable ('nt'), likely due to being novel variants. The most parsimonious distribution of acquisition events of SCCmec is indicated with roman numerals placed along the branches of the tree (where the roman numeral corresponds to the SCCmec type), although the actual number of SCCmec acquisitions may be higher. Note that while the different SCCmec types are present across the globe, the acquisition events tend to occur at the tips of the tree, suggesting that methicillin resistance tends to evolve within a local S. aureus strain as opposed to occurring once and then disseminating globally.",

(2012) examined the associations of these 33 regions with the slow parasite clearance rate phenotype and identified two adjacent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 14 kb apart in their sample on chromosome 13 showing significant associations. Cheeseman et al. (2012) then performed fine mapping in this region and applied the EHH statistic (Box 2) to visually confirm the extended haplotype homozygosity pattern in a 35-kb region on chromosome 13 characteristic of a selective sweep. Similar to the Cheeseman et al. (2012) study, Takala-Harrison et al. (2013) examined multiple populations from Cambodia, Thailand and Bangladesh for signatures of selection and association with the slow parasite clearance phenotype, with only Cambodian and Thai samples showing resistance phenotypes. The authors used efficient mixed-model association (EMMA, see Box 2)",
