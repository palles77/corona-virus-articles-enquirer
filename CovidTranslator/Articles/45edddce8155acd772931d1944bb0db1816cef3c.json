Evidence shows that hands of health care personnel may transmit pathogens from one infected or colonized site or patient to another. In addition, shared patient care devices and instruments can also transmit pathogens if not properly sterilized. For this reason, every patient interaction should include use of standard precautions, as listed in Box 1. 1 Hand hygiene is an essential component of standard precautions, and can be performed either with soap and water or alcohol-based products. Alcohol-based products are preferred as long as there is no visible soiling of the hands, because they have superior microcidal activity, reduced skin drying properties, and are more convenient. 1 In addition, nail length and type can affect hand hygiene efficacy, because nails can harbor bacterial organisms and yeast, so artificial or unkempt nails should be discouraged in the health care setting. 1 Use of protective barriers, such as gown, gloves, and masks, is not always necessary but should be guided toward the specific clinical encounter and worn if contact with bodily fluids or respiratory secretions is expected.",

These organisms are resistant to all but a few commercially available antibiotic agents and are increasing in prevalence. For example, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolates accounted for less than 5% of enterococcal species in 1990, but accounted for up to 25% of isolates in 2000; extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)producing gram-negative bacilli are now found in up to 44% of Klebsiella species. 10, 11 Given the rapid increase in resistant organisms and limited therapeutic options, prevention of spread within health care settings is essential. These agents are spread manually by the hands of health care workers, and use of contact precautions has been shown to prevent spread and manage outbreaks. 10 There is some evidence that routine, active surveillance for VRE rectal colonization in high-risk patients, as well as use of contact precautions, can prevent clinically significant VRE infections, but this has not been widely accepted. 11 The second indication for contact precautions is suspicion or confirmation of C difficile infection. C difficile is a spore-forming gram-positive anaerobic bacillus, accounting for the most common infectious cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Spores have the ability to persist for prolonged periods of time on patients and surfaces, are carried by hand-to-hand contact, and are resistant to routinely used disinfectants, making this pathogen a major cause of health care-associated diarrhea. Over the last decade there has been an increasing incidence and heightened transmissibility of this pathogen, caused in part by emergence of a new strain that produces an excess of toxins A and B, therefore increasing environmental contamination.",

Clearance can be proved with 3 negative nasal swabs for MRSA culture while off antibiotic therapy; alternatively a single nasal swab with MRSA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is effective. Although PCR testing is more expensive, it may prevent prolonged precautions and the associated adverse effects on patient experience (discussed later). 14 Without an active screening process, few individuals who have cleared MRSA will be identified, and they therefore require lifelong contact precautions per most hospital policies.",

Therefore, appropriate environmental control of the patient area has proved effective, assuming use of appropriate cleaning supplies (chlorine-based disinfectants and high-concentration hydrogen peroxide agents).
