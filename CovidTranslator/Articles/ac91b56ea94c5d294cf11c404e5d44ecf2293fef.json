In this outline, state and local communities are charged with enhancing their preparedness. In order to help public health officials better understand these charges, we have developed a visual analytics toolkit (PanViz) for analyzing the effect of decision measures implemented during a simulated pandemic influenza scenario. Spread vectors based on the point of origin and distance traveled over time are calculated and the factors of age distribution and population density are taken into effect. Healthcare officials are able to explore the effects of the pandemic on the population through a geographical spatiotemporal view, moving forward and backward through time and inserting decision points at various days to determine the impact. Linked statistical displays are also shown, providing county level summaries of data in terms of the number of sick, hospitalized and dead as a result of the outbreak. Currently, this tool has been deployed in Indiana State Department of Health planning and preparedness exercises, and as an educational tool for demonstrating the impact of social distancing strategies during the recent H1N1 (swine flu) outbreak.",

In recent years, one of the most notable potential mass casualty events that require appropriate planning is pandemic influenza. However, officials responsible for developing such plans must often rely on information and trends provided via very complex modeling (requiring supercomputers so that only a few cases can be considered due to resource constraints) or, at the opposite extreme, modeling that has incorporated very drastic simplifying assumptions so as to be computationally practical. Moreover, such plans are developed with only a few specific scenarios or preevent concepts in mind and often ignore the fact that the solutions dealing with a pandemic are very dependent on its underlying traits and actual characteristics, which cannot be known with any certainty a priori. Thus, there is a critical need to better equip public health officials responsible for pandemic influenza planning, or planning for other mass casualty events, with sophisticated yet easy to use tools that capture the complex elements, especially individual social behaviors, of traumatic events and that can also adjust as additional information is obtained and conditions evolve over time.",

            "text": "While desktop pandemic influenza modeling tools do exist (e.g., FluAid [1] , FluSurge [12] ), these tools are often restrictive in their scope and provide little to no spatiotemporal support to allow users to observe conditions evolving over time and space. To address this gap, visual analytics has emerged as a relatively new field formed at the intersection of analytical reasoning and interactive visual interfaces [38] . It is primarily concerned with presenting large amounts of information in a comprehensive and interactive manner. By doing so, the end user is able to quickly assess important data and, if required, investigate points of interest in detail. As such, we have developed a visual analytics toolkit (PanViz - Fig. 1 ) to aid in the modeling, analysis and exploration of pandemic influenza. Our interface utilizes linked views for displaying statistical information about populations under study, filtering controls for age and demographic data, and detailed bed capacity information at the county level. We provide end users with the means to interactively explore the model, make parameter changes, and engage in a variety of user created scenarios. As such, PanViz is able to provide healthcare officials with training and education scenarios for a variety of pandemic situations. Model parameters such as spread origin, mortality rate, etc. are all modifiable through a graphical user interface designed to support and enhance training exercises. Our toolkit was most recently deployed as a portion of the Indiana State Department of Health pandemic readiness training exercises, and was utilized as an educational tool for illustrating the potential impact of social distancing measures during the recent H1N1 outbreak [39] .",

PanViz is an effective method of communicating information between healthcare officials, first responders and the media, as well as providing insight into the impact of various responses and containment. The rationale for such a system is that mass casualty event response planning can be done with higher accuracy and more realism so that if an event happens, mitigation strategies can be invoked to minimize casualties as the event evolves. The potential impact of such a system is a reduction in the number of casualties associated with a mass casualty event and the overall health of U.S. citizens. This can be achieved via a mechanism to delineate decisions on mitigative measures, especially as additional information is gathered during the course of a pandemic or other mass casualty event. Thus, public health officials can use our tool as an operational research to both plan and rapidly assess health impacts, required community level resources, and the effect of potential decision strategies associated with a pandemic. The main thrust of our work is not creating an advanced model of influenza; instead, we provide a visual analytics environment in which users may effectively explore decision points and potential scenarios.",

            "text": "In all of the above modeling work, it is clear that there are a variety of strategies that can be implemented to reduce the impact of a pandemic, if the strategies are implemented early during the decision making process. However, these models are typically self-contained, unavailable to health care officials, or unlinked to any interactive visual interfaces. What is needed now are tools to help health officials prepare for an outbreak and disseminate information to the public in the event of a possible pandemic situation. Various modeling tools do exist which are meant to aid in pandemic preparation. FluAid is provided by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in order to assist state and local level planners in preparing for the next influenza pandemic [1] . This software provides a range of estimates of impact in terms of deaths, hospitalizations, and outpatients visits. FluSurge is a spreadsheet-based model which provides hospital administrators and public health officials estimates of the surge in demand for hospital-based services during the next influenza pandemic [12] . While these simulation tools provide excellent statistical support to planners, they are fairly restrictive in their scope, and do not provide any spatiotemporal support. Work done by Germann et al. [19] begins addressing this shortcoming. They developed a simulation which allows various intervention strategies to be set and simulations to be run. Results are displayed via a heat map displaying illness attack rates over the entire nation, and charts of incidence rates. However, this is a complex, large scale simulation which requires a supercomputing platform in order to run. User interaction is largely absent, and investigating the effect of decision changes requires a re-running of the entire simulation. In response, our application provides a desktop pandemic modeling tool with interactive, spatiotemporal support. This allows users to observe conditions evolving over time and space. Decision changes can be made interactively, and results modeled immediately as users simulate each time step.",

The form of this curve is based on epidemic curves experienced during the 1918 influenza pandemic and presented by (though not necessarily endorsed by) M. Cetron (DGMQ, CDC) which originated with S. Barrett and MIDAS. The baseline prevalence (y 0 ) of an individual being infected with pandemic influenza, no decision measures yet implemented, can be approximated from the gross attack rate (GAR). The percent gross attack rate (GAR) is the percentage of the entire U.S. population that will have a clinical case of influenza. GAR is closely related to the mean number of secondary cases a typical single infected case will cause in a population with no immunity to the disease in the absence of interventions to control the infection [37] , called the basic reproduction number (R 0 ). In the initial setup and default values for the model, we did assume a GAR of % 30% and R 0 % 2:0 as indicated. This leads us to an analytic expression for a prevalence curve (or the baseline probability mentioned above) that is used to drive the model and compute the daily number of new infected individuals as provided in Table 1 . The specific parameter values for this expression are defined by Brigantic et al. [7] . A rough way to calculate R 0 for a simple single population is to take the product of the attack rate and the duration of infection (in this case the sum of the incubation and shedding periods). The incubation period is the time elapsed between exposure to a pathogenic organism and when symptoms and signs are first apparent [37] and the shedding period is the time that infected person can expel virus particles from the body, important routes include respiratory tract. These parameter values are based on a literature review that was further vetted by subject matter experts to arrive at appropriate values representative of pandemic influenza. These values are not necessarily specific to only air travel/airports, but are completely appropriate for cities or small towns. Moreover, these parameter values can be modified by the user of the PanViz tool, either to mimic alternate assumptions for pandemic influenza as desired and/or to model other potential infectious disease (e.g., smallpox) as well.",

The model employed by PanViz was designed to determine the number of influenza outbreak infections, hospitalizations, and deaths on a daily basis. As input, it requires the pandemic influenza characteristics, county data such as population, demographics [40] , and hospital beds [2] , and potential decision measures like closing schools. Spread vectors based on the point of origin and distance traveled per day are calculated, and effects on different age groups and population densities are taken into account. Fig. 2 (Left) illustrates the infection probability model utilized by PanViz. In this case, users may vary the magnitude of the pandemic through a simple graphical user interface, Fig. 2 (Right) . Users can directly control the mortality and infection rates, allowing for the creation of multiple scenarios and the ability to adapt this model to various ranges of pandemics. As the pandemic spreads over time, the peak wave hits various counties at different days as shown in Fig. 2 (Middle) . In this case, the left curve is for a higher population density county that is also closer to the origin county than the right curve. Under the person-toperson contact model, the pandemic spreads diffusely from a single point source location at a constant rate. Fig. 3 shows the effects of modifying the spread origin. Previous work in disease modeling has looked at other means of spread vectors such as generation interval [24] in which a transmission delay is introduced between the host and those agents the host infects, and at the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome in household contacts [36] . In order to more realistically demonstrate the speed with which influenza can travel, we have also included travel between the 15 largest airports as part of the model. For a given location, the amount of time required for it to be affected is now determined by the minimum of the distance either from that point to the pandemic origin, or from that point to the nearest airport plus the distance Table 3 Default parameter settings.",

Once the disease reaches the nearest airport, it will begin spreading to all other cities with airport hubs on the subsequent day. Fig. 4 illustrates the difference between a single point source spread and the utilization of air travel routes for spread. Future work will focus on better parameterizing the airport spread models based on typical hub transportation. Along with modeling the spread from a given point of origin, our model also allows users to input an estimate of the number of days a person will remain sick, how many days a hospitalized person will remain in the hospital, and, if a person is going to die from the pandemic, how many days it will take the person to succumb. Fig. 5 provides a quick overview of the a simulated pandemic in a single county in Indiana. Here, we can observe the number of sick, hospitalized and dead individuals and note the lag between the sick and dead curves due to the user specified parameter. Again, many influenza models have been tested, from looking at the transmissibility of swine flu at Fort Dix in 1976 [26] , to simulating pandemic influenza in San Antonio, Texas [32] . Our system enhances these modeling capabilities by allowing users to interactively adjust parameters and then visualize the result in an interactive environment.",

However, other work suggests that for multiple outbreak sites, the idea of quarantines will prove ineffectual [33] . Detailed descriptions of the effects of various decision measure strategies can also be found in [19, 32] , along with others.

On Day 1 of the simulated pandemic, it is projected that Hamilton County will required 32 additional hospital beds over its baseline capacity usage to support the pandemic.

In the graphs of Fig. 7 (Right) , the user can immediately see how the use of the (SNS) has helped mitigate the magnitude of the pandemic. Through these controls, the user can interactively toggle decision points on and off and explore the effects that decisions taking place in the past would have on the current situation. Interactive toggling allows the user to understand the magnitude of the change by watching both the graphs and map display colors change for a given day as decision measures are implemented. Future work will include the use of more advanced decision measures and allow for both local and national measures.

Fig. 8 was used as an educational component of the functional exercises to illustrate the importance of advanced surge capacity plans. In Fig. 8 the number of available hospital beds (as noted in the Emergency Preparedness Atlas: U.S. Nursing Home and Hospital Facilities [2] ) is displayed for each county. In our model, it is assumed that 70% of all beds are full due to general medical needs. As an example, on Day 1 of the pandemic, our model estimates that Hamilton County will need 32 of its 144 beds for patients as a direct result of the pandemic influenza. By Day 10, Hamilton County will need 762 of its 144 beds for patients as a direct result of the pandemic. One can quickly observe (by color) that all counties across the state have quickly reached their bed capacity. These striking visuals created wide spread discussion amongst participants and provided greater gravitas for the exercises.",

Furthermore, the educational value of easy to understand visuals as a means for conveying information to the public cannot be overstated. As such, our PanViz tool provides an easy to use interface for both the modeling and exploration of pandemics for use in both training and operational research. We plan to further pursue our collaborations to port this into a fully functional emergency response tool where more detailed critical tasks can be solved. Fig. 10 . Here we illustrate the potential impact that social distancing and early vaccination could have on magnitude of a pandemic influenza. For Days 19 and 37 we present a comparison of the effects of a pandemic when no social distancing or vaccinations have been employed (the left map for each day) with the effect of an application of social distancing and vaccinations (the right map for each day).
