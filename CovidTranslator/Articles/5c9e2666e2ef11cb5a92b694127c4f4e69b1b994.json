The risk-based surveillance on high-risk individuals e.g. contacts, enhances the ability to detect the expected few new cases as soon as possible by targeting those that are more likely to be infected than others. In a very low prevalence or early epidemic scenario, risk-based surveillance is cost-efficient and more likely to find cases than random survey-based surveillance, because resources are targeted at the high-risk subpopulations. However, once the infection becomes established and individual clusters are no longer traced, the usefulness of syndromic or risk-based surveillance data to guide control decisions at community level is reduced, because the cases identified are not representative of the infected individuals in the population. Furthermore, identified cases will already be needing health care and the health systems become reactive to the current situation, rather than proactive in prioritising, what is needed where in the coming weeks.",

            "text": "medicine, epidemics due to new or exotic disease incursion into fully susceptible populations are not uncommon e.g. Avian Influenza, Bluetongue in Europe and Porcine Endemic Diarrhoea in the US. Regular outbreaks of exotic or novel diseases have resulted in a documented experience in handling outbreaks in fully susceptible populations, and the veterinary sector has a skilled, well-developed and trialled emergency response in most countries. Throughout time, a variety of surveillance methods to understand the spread and to support effective control decisions in real time, have been successfully applied and resulted in elimination of the disease from the populations. We encourage the public health sector to consider whether the veterinary experience obtained from epidemics in animal populations could offer additional expertise to the current vigorous public health response to COVID-19.",

            "text": "governing animal health interventions is powerful, primarily for the sake of people: to protect livelihoods, food chains, businesses and national economics. In other words, the incentives to efficiently contain outbreaks of infectious diseases are strong, just like the ones we see with the COVID-19 outbreak. For this reason, veterinary epidemiologists have a welldeveloped toolbox of surveillance strategies. During an outbreak among animals, random surveys are conducted to understand the epidemic nature and dynamics of the infection and provide evidence for decision-making on control. From random surveys, a prevalence estimate is calculated to understand the extent of the spread of disease, to follow the situation over time and to suggest, predict or model, what happens in near future. Random surveys are representative of the population they sample, and provide better knowledge of the situation than the other types of surveillance, delivering more accurate evidence for decision-making on community control options. Furthermore, repeated representative sampling of apparently healthy individuals provides estimates of newly infected, not yet symptomatic individuals and generates parameters to 'predict' the epidemic curve days or weeks ahead. An area with a steep increase in infected individuals are likely to have an increased need for medical resources in the common day and weeks. This may allow for some adaption and prioritisation of resources. We would like to encourage regions and countries to consider adding repeated random surveys to their surveillance system during the COVID-19 outbreak to generate a robust evidence base for decision-making on community control and health resource allocation. Depending on the rigor and frequency of the surveys within a region or country, they would support policy and decision-making in several areas: 1) Early in, and at the height of, the epidemic o Point to where health system resources are needed in the coming weeks, by estimating the proportions of ill, infected, but asymptomatic and non-infected. Assess the impact and effectiveness of implemented control measures with regular intervals by following the epidemic curve of infection. o Guide tightening or relaxing control measures, by understanding where on the epidemic curve the outbreak is within a community/region/country. o Provide reliable population estimates for disease spread modelling and research to support policy-making. 2) Late in the epidemic o Inform decisions on when community control measures can be lifted, by mapping the infection curves and the proportion of immunity in the population. o Prioritise vaccination, when a vaccine becomes available, by monitoring levels of immunity and current infections in the populations. Considering the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, frequent surveys are recommended during the outbreak as a supplement to the very important case finding surveillance already in place. Obviously, resources, laboratory capacity and many other factors influence whether repeated surveys are feasible in public health and under the current conditions.",
