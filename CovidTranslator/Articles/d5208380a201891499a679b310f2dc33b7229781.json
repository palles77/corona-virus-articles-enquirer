This need for information is particularly the case for systemic glucocorticosteroids 6 and for recently introduced medications, such as salmeterol, formoterol, and leucotriene-receptor antagonists. One negative point is that, when systemic glucocorticosteroids are administered during the first trimester, the risk of an orofacial cleft is increased by about 3, although the power of the studies is poor and many confounding factors persist. One positive point is that more than 11000 women have been exposed to inhaled corticosteroids (mostly beclomethasone and budesonide) during pregnancy with no increase of outcomes in the infant (including congenital malformations). 2 The higher reported risk of hypertension and pre-eclampsia in steroid-treated pregnant women is not related to the drugs but to uncontrolled asthma. 8 Thus, because many clinical trials on inhaled corticosteroids have shown efficacy in pregnant asthmatic women in terms of symptoms, lung function, and reduction of asthma exacerbations, maintaining asthma control during pregnancy is the goal; and, when the indication is clear (eg, severe asthma exacerbation), the benefit of systemic glucocorticosteroids is far greater than the risk.",

The urgency of robust public-private partnering is clear in the Asia-Pacific region, where the threat of new human infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, challenge systems that have not received adequate investment to scale-up to successfully meet these new threats. The economics of intervention by the private sector are not always self-evident. Much depends on the ability of the public sector to induce private firms to act for the common good. Market incentives, such as tax breaks and subsidies, can lower the cost of training and help businesses provide information and education for workers. The reduction in duties and taxes on imports of equipment and reagents could reduce drug costs. The cornerstone of partnership is for each sector to understand the needs and motivations of the other.",

While businesses in the rest of the world are becoming less concerned about AIDS, the contradictory trend in South Africa is being driven, on the face of it, by two imperatives.

This is where, increasingly, private companies are stepping in. \"The corporate sector is shouldering more responsibility for the health of its workforce than it ever has in the past\", says Bernie Clark of the health-care consulting team of Alexander Forbes, a firm that advises businesses on employee benefits and has helped several companies to develop AIDS policies (Clark B, Alexander Forbes, Johannesburg, South Africa, personal communication).

A leading example of AIDS management in Asia is Thailand, where strong political backing for awareness and prevention campaigns has held the infection rate to 1\u00b75% 3 -compared with South Africa's 22%. 4 In Thailand, the Thailand Business Coalition on AIDS has spawned its own umbrella organisation in the Asian Business Coalition on AIDS. The coalitions' activities, though, are limited to education and prophylaxis, and do not include inhouse treatment. 5 The most recent survey of the World Economic Forum's Global Health Initiative 6 shows that awareness by business that AIDS will affect operations and profits reflects the level of efforts to combat the disease. South African business leaders are well ahead of the rest of the world at 72% awareness; south and south-east Asia, where the Thai and Asian coalitions are active, lags at 37%. Then the levels fall off even more dramatically: in east Asia, where, in China, one of the most worrying prevalences is developing, awareness is at a low 21%, as it is in Latin America. 6 The Global Health Initiative worked with several South African firms to organise case studies, which vividly illustrate the imperatives and benefits for companies offering antiretrovirals to their employees. Gold Fields, for example, a mining house with 48 000 mainly low-skilled workers in South Africa, calculated that-with one in three of its miners HIV positive-failure to intervene would lead to losses of up to 10% of 2002 earnings by the year 2006.",
