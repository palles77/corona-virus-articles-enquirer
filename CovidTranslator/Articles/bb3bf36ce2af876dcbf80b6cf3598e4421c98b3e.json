Interferon in combination with ribavirin was the gold standard for treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-uninfected patients, inducing a 40% rate of sustained response [3] . However, a cumulative sustained virological response (SVR) was observed in only 22% (95% Confidence interval (CI), 14 -30%) of 111 patients enrolled in four pilot uncontrolled studies aiming to assess the efficacy and tolerability of ribavirin plus interferon alfa1 administered thrice weekly in HIV/HCV co-infected patients [4 -7] . So there is an urgent need for new and more effective treatment schedules for hepatitis C in HIV co-infected patients. Among patients treated with interferon alfa three times weekly an intermittent increase of HCV viral load is observed on treatmentfree days [8] . Daily administration of interferon could maintain a sustained antiviral effect on HCV; this schedule is expected to increase the efficacy of interferon alfa 2.",

Thus addition of amantadine and intensification of interferon schedule with daily administration could be expected to increase the efficacy of standard combination treatment with ribavirin and interferon administered thrice weekly.

We can therefore hypothesize that in patients without a high probability of response and early stage of liver fibrosis a watchful waiting strategy would not reduce the potential efficacy of anti-HCV treatment.

Although this data should be interpreted with caution, given the high proportion of DOs, this result reinforces/supports the observation of a nearly absolute negative predictive value of the lack of a 12-week virologic response in HCV non-infected patients treated with pegylated interferons [13, 14] . As we enter an era in which HCV treatment is going to be pursued aggressively in HIV/HCV-co-infected persons, more and more emphasis must be placed on identifying at an early stage subjects who will not benefit from an expensive and poorly tolerated therapy. If these results are confirmed by larger studies, anti-HCV treatment could be stopped after 12 weeks, without decreasing the expected rate of SVR, in HIV-infected patients who did not show at least a 2-log drop in HCVRNA level.",

The best candidates for anti-HCV treatment are patients infected by HCV genotype 2 or 3 with normal GGT levels. The lack of a 2-log drop in HCVRNA level after 12 weeks of treatment seems to be highly predictive of the poor efficacy of anti-HCV treatment.",
