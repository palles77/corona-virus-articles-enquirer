Secondly, the inter-relationships of these variables at both the farm and the individual calf level were studied. Within this analytical framework, specific hypotheses were formulated relating to preventive treatments given to the dam, calving management, care of the newborn calf (including methods and timing of colostrum feeding and the administration of preventive treatments), and care of the calf from birth to weaning, particularly with regard to factors such as housing and feeding. Finally, some of the possible longterm sequelae of calfhood morbidity were evaluated. The overall objective of the research was to identify methods of calf husbandry associated with decreased morbidity, mortality and drug use in order to provide a rational basis for future calf management recommendations to dairy farmers. This paper, the first in a series of four, describes the manner in which this observational study was designed and implemented, and summarizes, in a descriptive fashion, the basic results. Other papers, both those included in this series and some appearing elsewhere, will describe in more detail the findings of the study.",

This questionnaire had been pre-tested on veterinary colleagues and on a group of dairy farmers, not involved in the study, near Barrie, Ontario. As a result of these pre-tests, parts of the questionnaire were extensively re-written. At the end of one year of data collection, a review questionnaire containing 12 questions from the original questionnaire was mailed to each farm. Completed questionaaires were returned by mail or via the Wintario project technicians at their regular visits. For ease of final coding, and because most husbandry factors are by nature qualitative (housing and feed types, for instance), all questions on both questionnaires were structured to yield categorical answers. At the end of the study, as part of a more general management survey, dairymen were asked to note any recently implemented calf management policy changes. These questionnaires, modified by information on policy changes gleaned via notes, phone calls and farm visits throughout the study, formed the basis of the farm-level management data set.",

Secondly, at the end of the study, farm-level management classifications of intensive farms (based on questionnaires) were compared to actual practices on those farms (based on individual calf records}. For instance, farms were classified according to whether or not farmers said they routinely administered vitamins (Yes) or not {No) to newborn calves during the summer. Then, based on individual calf records, the proportion of newborn calve~ actually given vitamins was calculated for each farm. The mean proportion of calves receiving the vitamins in the Yes category was then contrasted with the mean proportion of calves given vitamins in the No category, using a Student's t-test. Since farm managemeat policies sometimes changed from year to year, only data collected between 16 November 1981 and 15 November 1982 were used for this purpose.",

Farm morbidity rates were similarly skewed, with half the farmers administering less than one treatment day per calf in a given season. This suggests that many farmers had few disease problems with their calves, whereas a few had moderate to severe problems. Correlations of morbidity rates from one season with those of the next indicated significant consistency from season to season and year to year (r values ranged from 0.28 to 0.82). No similar consistency was observed for mortality rates. Some results of the initial questionnaire on farm management policies are summarized in Tables X to XII. No major changes in policies occurred over the three years of the project. There was a slight shift toward the use of more routine preventive treatments (vaccines, vitamins, antimicrobials) in both dams and calves, although the increase in vaccine use in the final winter of the study was primarily attributable to participation in the vaccine field trial. In the second year of the study, farmers gave lower estimates about the proportion of calvings they usually attended. For both summer and winter, there was a shift away from group pens (which initially comprised almost one quarter of calf housing systems) to hutches and individual pens.

A descriptive observational study, in which one wishes to estimate population parameters such as calf mortality, requires that a true random sample be taken from the target population, or a population as typical of the target as possible. On the other hand, an analytical observational study designed for hypothesis testing may produce valid results if based on a purposive (nonprobability) sample, although it may suffer from decreased generalizability if the sample study group is not typical of the target population. Ideally, if the random sample is large enough, and one has available the resources required to collect sufficiently detailed information, the descriptive and the analytical objectives can be combined into one study.",

However, the degree to which stated calf management policies were adhered to varied between farms, and between specific practices within farms. This may, at least in part, have been influenced by how different farmers interpreted the questions. The question of when calves receive their first colostrum is, for instance, open to differing interpretations. Farmers may be referring to when they know their calves first received colostrum (perhaps the first milking after calving) or when the calves probably received their first colostrum (which in the case of calves left with dams, could well be within 2 h of birth). Finally, the low rate of implementation of preventive vitamin and antimicrobial administration to calves in particular may reflect the fact that these practices were not recorded as check-offs on the calf birthday form, but required the farmer to make notes in the daily log sheets. Hence the recorded rates may underestimate the true rates.",

The answers to some questions, such as those referring to place of calving, calf housing (validity data not shown), navel treatment of newborn calves, and method of feeding first colostrum (Table III) accurately reflect the real situation. Others, such as those referring to routine administration of vitamins or antimicrobials (and probably by analogy routines and content of calf feeding) differentiate groups of farms with regard to management practices. Nevertheless, given the low rate of implementation of stated farm policy at the calf level, the questionnaire results would be difficult to interpret without data available to clarify them at the individual calf level. Least valid are answers to questions assessing interference at calving and timing of first colostrum, which do not appear to differentiate significantly between recorded implemented farm policies.",

(1974) from New York state (15.8--27.2%), or Bowman et al. (1977) from Quebec (13.7%), all of which are comparable dairy farming areas. The use of mean herd rates can be misleading however, since many herds in this study lost no live-born heifer calves at all in a given six-month period, while several farms lost a third to two-thirds of theirs. Presumably similar patterns occur in other studies as well (see for instance, Leech et al., 1968) . In this context, the median is perhaps a more appropriate indicator, at least to separate 'problem' from 'nonproblem' farms.",

Much of the variation between farms could be attributed to differences in tension applied to the tape by different farmers. Simensen (1982) has reported that heart-girth measurements correlate well with calf weights, and are reproducible, if the weight load on the tape measure is defined. In the absence of such a tension-definition (such as occurred in this study) heart-girth measurements could only serve to make crude within-farm comparisons of calf weights. Farm-to-farm measurement variations would be expected to account, in large measure, for the wide range seen in birth weights (23 to 74 kg) and for the fact that the weights reported here were somewhat higher than those reported as 'normal' by other authors (Foley et al., 1972; Roy, 1980b) . The rates of gain to two weeks and weaning were within the normal range.",

It is tempting to conclude that the low use of preventive antimicrobials reflects the ability of the dairymen to control disease problems using other strategies, including, for example, the use of calf hutches.
