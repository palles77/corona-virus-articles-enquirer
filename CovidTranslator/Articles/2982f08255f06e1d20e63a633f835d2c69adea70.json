            "text": "Two field studies were accomplished on a dairy farm in Saxony to compare different strategies for the control of natural cryptosporidiosis in newborn calves. In the first study, 96 newborn calves were allocated to four different groups immediately after birth. Calves of group H and of group HN were treated orally with 120 g/kg body weight (BW) of halofuginone lactate daily during the first seven days of life. Calves of group C and of group CN were treated with a same volume of tap water. As an additional measure, the pens of groups HN and CN were disinfected with 3% Neopredisan 135-1 \u00ae (p-chloro-m-cresol), the pens of groups C and H remained non-disinfected. Faeces were examined semi-quantitatively for oocyst excretion using carbolfuchsin-staining and the clinical course was recorded. While disinfection alone (group CN) had no effect on oocyst shedding and diarrhoea, treatment with halofuginone lactate (groups H and HN) reduced oocyst shedding and diarrhoea significantly. Combination of treatment and disinfection (group HN) controlled cryptosporidiosis completely during the first two weeks after birth. However, prevalence of diarrhoea and oocyst shedding was higher in the third week of life in group HN than in any of the other groups. This delayed occurrence of cryptosporidiosis was not seen in study 2 when all calves were similarly protected by treatment and specific disinfection. Oocyst shedding was not observed in peripartal cows either by carbolfuchsin staining, ELISA or PCR.",

Moreover, 19 samples were also examined by PCR. DNA was extracted with QuiAmp \u00ae Stool Kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final PCR mixture contained 3.5 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 0.5 M of each primer (CP 3.4-3 and CP 3.4-5 ; Petry et al., 1998; Joachim et al., 2003b) and 1 U of Taq polymerase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). 2.5 l DNA was added to 22.5 l of the master mix. The PCR programme (except 'program' in computers) consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94 \u2022 C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 \u2022 C for 45 s, 57 \u2022 C for 45 s, 72 \u2022 C for 1 min, and a final extension step of 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. The products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed using a digital camera. Presence or absence of the expected DNA band (650 base pairs in size) was recorded.",

However, in the field it appears difficult if not impossible to reduce the oocyst number in a presumably heavily contaminated environment below the level needed to infect calves. No reliable data regarding the infective dose is available for cattle, but the median infective dose of C. parvum oocysts in men is as low as 132 oocysts (DuPont et al., 1995) . Considering that millions of oocysts can be shed in one gram of calf faeces and that several hundreds of oocysts are sufficient to infect calves, it is obvious, that even inactivation of 99% of oocysts (which is defined as sufficient under in vitro conditions) may not absolutely prevent infection with the consequence of rapid recontamination of calf stables. In addition to remains of previous contamination in cleaned and disinfected crates and rapid increase of infection pressure by droppings of diseased calves kept in the same environment, animal keepers and other mechanical vectors (e.g. flies) may help to distribute oocysts into appropriately cleaned and disinfected premises (Graczyk et al., 2000) .",

The combination of disinfection and treatment in study 1 (group HN) gave the best results during the period of highest susceptibility of calves to cryptosporidiosis, i.e. the first 2 weeks after birth. Therefore, this strategy was applied on all calves of the respective age group in study 2, supplemented by additional disinfection of the K1 area (group housing) to avoid exposure of previously protected calves to infection after movement to a potentially contaminated group pen. Under farm conditions the simultaneous keeping of non-protected controls would bear the risk of accidental carryover of oocysts into the experimental premises and thus might alter the interpretability of results. On the other hand, without a control group it is difficult to estimate the course of infection if disinfection and treatment were not applied. We attempted to resolve this dilemma by examining a control group and performing the control strategy trial subsequently, assuming that the overall conditions are comparable and results obtained from the controls can be extrapolated to the study period.",

The combination of pro-/metaphylactic treatment within the 1st week of age and specific disinfection of single crates substantially improved control during the most critical period (1st and 2nd week of life). Properly protected young calves may remain more susceptible to cryptosporidia afterwards and therefore it is advisable to also disinfect group pens before previously protected calves are brought in.",
