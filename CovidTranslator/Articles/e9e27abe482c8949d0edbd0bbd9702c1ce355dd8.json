Weather parameters during the preceding week were included in the model on the basis of the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19, since this was likely to reflect weather at the time of disease transmission. [10] The dependent variable in the Poisson model was the number of incident cases in the cell-week and exposure was the population in the cell, allowing for clustering by the grid cell identifier over weeks, with incidence rate ratio as the outcome. In the absence of established hypotheses on relationships between ecological factors and SARS-CoV-2 transmission, tertiles of quantitative variables were constructed as independent variables to avoid erroneously imposing linear assumptions. Grid cells which had no incident cases reported throughout January and February were excluded, in the absence of any evidence of the possibility of transmission in the cell.",

This amounted to an overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases of 0.12 per 1,000 population. In 113/559 (20.2%) of grid cells with cases, there was only one case during the whole period, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 cases. Table 1 summarises the data included in building a Poisson regression model. Because of concerns about collinearity between maximum and minimum temperatures and solar radiation for constructing a multivariable regression model, average daily temperature was calculated as the average of maximum and minimum daily temperatures, as a single measure of temperature. Then, to avoid imposing linear relationships between temperature, solar radiation and COVID-19 incidence, which appeared improbable from the bivariable results, a tertiles of tertiles approach was used, in which tertiles of average temperature were further broken down into tertiles of solar radiation, as shown in Figure 2 . The nine categories derived in this way were then used as a categorical independent variable in the regression model, rather than having separate competing variables for temperature and solar radiation. Figure 3 shows adjusted incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the overall regression model. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (adjusted for week, population density and precipitation) for the composite temperature-radiation variable from the regression model are also shown in Figure 2 .",

This corresponds to the highest incidence rate ratio categories in the assessment for the rest of China shown in Figure 3 . While the open-access individual case data is a hugely valuable resource, it is not able to tell the full story of the circumstances of each case. The nature of COVID-19 transmission is such that many cases will have no idea exactly where, when or how they acquired their infection, and so the location data for cases are inevitably more reflective of illness rather than infection. During the period of COVID-19 spread around China, following the initial epicentre epidemic in Wuhan City, the Chinese authorities implemented stringent infection reduction measures in many locations, the exact nature and chronology of which are not documented. The somewhat counterintuitive relationship seen in this assessment between population density and COVID-19 incidence very likely reflects the effectiveness of infection control measures targeted at densely populated urban areas. However, records of cases in 559 locations outside Wuhan City, as shown in Figure 1 [a], show that there was widespread nationwide transmission, even though only a single case was recorded in 20% of locations with cases, which probably speaks to the effectiveness of control measures in many places.",

Conversely brighter, drier weather may stimulate levels of social interaction, and thereby possibly counteract direct effects of heat and light on viruses. The complex relationship between temperature and solar radiation, as shown in Figure 2 , is important, because the effects of temperature and light, particularly in the ultra-violet spectrum, have been shown to be associated with seasonal viral activity in other contexts.

Neither does it justify any generalisations to the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic will simply go away given some nice summer weather. However, the size of the associations between weather and incidence in China are very much of public health interest in understanding the continuing spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus around the world, in different climate zones. The possibility that transmission is reduced during periods of brighter, warmer, drier weather is important. Further assessments of this kind in other locations and seasons are needed to build a full picture, but meteorological data should be considered for inclusion in overall models of COVID-19 epidemiology and spread of the pandemic.",

An observational study of this kind cannot formally attribute cause and effect, and there remain uncertainties which have to be considered as unknown unknowns. Nevertheless, this assessment of the effects of weather on COVID-19 transmission in China suggests variations of a sufficient magnitude to have important possible consequences for understanding the current COVID-19 pandemic in other settings. This assessment also illustrates the value of the detailed open-access data available on COVID-19 cases and ecological parameters.",
