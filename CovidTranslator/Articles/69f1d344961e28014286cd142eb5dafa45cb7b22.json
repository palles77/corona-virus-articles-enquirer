In addition to providing patient care, health care facilities must also protect their patients, staff, and visitors from exposure to potentially infectious patients. Between April 15 and June 9, 2003 , 74 SARS cases were reported to Toronto Public Health. Of these, 29 (39%) of 74 were among health care workers, 28 (38%) of 34 occurred as a result of exposure during hospitalization, and 17 (23%) of 74 occurred among hospital visitors. 1 Under these scenarios, staffing shortages are probable, appropriate respiratory protection supplies will be in high demand, and the need to isolate potentially infectious patients will exceed the availability of airborne infection isolation rooms.",

HEPA filters are at least 99.97% efficient in removing particles that are 0.3 mm (the size most difficult to capture) and essentially 100% efficient for particles either larger or smaller than 0.3 mm. The selection of portable filtration technology as an evaluated approach was fueled by its compatibility with existing ventilation systems, its affordability, and its recognition in published literature as an available engineering control to assist in patient isolation. [7] [8] [9] [10] In particular, these references cite the use of portable filtration units as a way to increase the effective dilution of airborne contaminants within a designated airborne infection isolation room. By virtue of a ''zone-within-zone'' approach to configuring patient isolation areas, the researchers sought to improve on the traditional wholeroom dilution approach to contaminant control by sig-nificantly increasing source containment and capture efficiency within a smaller inner isolation zone occupied by the patient. In this manner, contaminant spread to the remainder of the room (the outer zone) could be minimized, thus reducing health care worker exposure potential.",

In actual practice, the cotton privacy curtains could remain in place, and the plastic curtains could be mounted inside of the cotton. The plastic curtains were constructed from 4mil plastic sheeting sold as painting drop cloth in home improvement and painting supply stores. The plastic curtains were mounted to within approximately 0.5 inch (1.3 cm) of the ceiling curtain track using the existing curtain hooks, thus retaining the curtain's ability to be completely opened and closed.

The inlet perimeter of the HEPA unit was tightly secured to the 2 curtains using plastic sheeting and strips of sheathing tape. In this configuration, the HEPA unit pulled ''contaminated'' air from the 2 patient isolation areas (inner zones) and discharged clean air into the remainder of the room (the common outer zone). After initial tests revealed a transfer of source aerosol between the 2 patient isolation zones, additional 4-mil plastic sheeting was used to construct a floor-to-ceiling vertical partition at the inlet-side of the HEPA unit to prevent such migration. A photograph of the inlet side of the HEPA unit showing the vertical partition, as well as the plastic curtains taped into place, is shown in Figure 3 . To facilitate controlled airflow into the inner isolation zones, each curtain was retracted to create a gap approximately 10 inches (0.25 m) wide near the head of the respective patient beds where the patient care provider might frequently stand. The gap width selection was based on qualitative smoke tests using a handheld smoke generator (Cumulus Air Flow Indicator, Draeger Safety Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). This gap provided a strategic path of least resistance for air to enter the inner isolation zone and flow past the health care worker, over the patient, and toward the HEPA unit with minimal recirculation inside the enclosure.",

Expressed in terms of air changes per hour, the unit provided more than 13 air changes per hour of filtration for the entire patient room (inner and outer zones) while providing more than 32 air changes per hour for the isolated inner zones of the 2-patient configuration and more than 65 air changes per hour for the isolated inner zone of the singlepatient configuration. All of these values compare favorably with design recommendations provided by the CDC, the American Institute of Architects, and the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, which prescribe at least 12 air changes per hour for engineered airborne infection isolation rooms, although for engineered rooms, they also prescribe at least 2 air changes per hour of outdoor air. [7] [8] [9] 12 When open, the HVAC supply diffuser near patient bed 1 delivered 185 cfm (0.09 cms), the diffuser near patient bed 2 delivered 130 cfm (0.06 cms), and the exhaust grille removed 155 cfm (0.07 cms) from the room. The bathroom flow rates were 90 cfm (0.04 cms) of supply air and 125 cfm (0.06 cms) of exhaust air directed to the outdoors, resulting in more than 18 air changes per hour within the restroom while maintaining it under negative pressure. Thus, even within the restroom, the airflow values maintained consistency with the prescribed design recommendations for engineered isolation rooms.",

The key characteristic of the observed reductions is the controlled movement of the particles away from the patient and provider and toward the HEPA unit. This controlled movement allows providers to minimize their exposure by positioning themselves away from the airflow path.

The expedient isolation alternative appears to offer fast, affordable, and effective patient isolation during unique circumstances in which engineered isolation rooms are unavailable. The best-performing designs showed no measurable source migration out of the inner isolation zone and mean respirable particle counts up to 87% lower at the health care worker position(s) than those observed directly near the source patient location. The zone-withinzone patient isolation approach also offers a greater protective benefit to nonprovider hospital workers, visitors, and other patients over approaches that rely solely on isolating entire wards, floors, or designated facilities. Such ''big-area'' approaches invite a wide contaminant distribution that increases the potential for airborne and surface contact exposures to all who enter. In contrast, the inner isolation zones in the zone-within-zone approach use a much higher ventilation rate while containing contaminant distribution within a much smaller area, thereby reducing the potential for airborne or surface contact.

It represents the relative ability of a tested scenario to reduce the risk of airborne exposure to the health care worker. evaluated expedient designs took fewer than 3 personhours to construct at a total cost (including US$2,195 for the HEPA unit) of less than US$2,300. Because many hospitals already own high-flow-rate, HEPA-filtered, ''negative-air'' exhaust systems that they use for dust control during renovation work, the expedient isolation cost could be reduced to perhaps US$50 to US$100 per isolation area because only the plastic sheeting and other expendable materials would be needed. The 3-hour assembly time for the prototype was likely much longer than would be required to erect a preplanned enclosure for which the design was identified and evaluated ahead of time and with which the assemblers were familiar. To minimize construction time, the assembly training and practice could be incorporated into the facility's emergency operations preparation activities.",

First, the study was limited to a discrete set of enclosure designs evaluated in a single facility, whereas actual work environments will undoubtedly require variations to accommodate specific patient care situations and health care facility engineering characteristics. Additional work is needed to refine design options that integrate the enclosure systems with the facility HVAC systems to ensure pathogen control while maintaining patient comfort, without interfering with HVAC operation in other areas of the facility. Second, the measurements were performed without an actual patient in place and undergoing normal care so that the influence of factors such as patient movement, positioning, breathing, and coughing, as well as care provider movements on system effectiveness, remains to be evaluated. Finally, actual pathogenic bioaerosols were not used in the work; however, this should not be considered a limitation because the determining factor in particle movement and filtration efficiency is particle aerodynamic size. Because the viability and pathogenicity of biologic aerosols are negatively affected by environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, and oxygen toxicity, 13,14 use of inanimate surrogates actually represents a conservative evaluation of system effectiveness.",
