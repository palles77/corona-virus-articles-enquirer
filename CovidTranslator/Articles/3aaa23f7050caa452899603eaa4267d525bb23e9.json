Viral RNA was detectable in 28 of the 54 patients tested. Cumulative data showed that 67 of the 73 SARS patients demonstrated seroconversion by week 5 of illness. In contrast, only 1 of 278 healthy subjects enrolled in the study was found to be positive for the IgG antibody. Coexistence of viral RNA in plasma and specific antibodies was simultaneously observed over three consecutive weeks in two critical cases. In three convalescent patients in particular, cultivable SARS-CoV was detected in stool or urine specimens for longer than 4 weeks (29-36 days). These findings suggest that SARS-CoV may remain viable in the excretions of convalescent patients.",

The supernatant was isolated by centrifugation, sterilized by passing through a 0.22 \u00b5m Millipore filter, and spread onto a monolayer of Vero E6 cells in a 24-well plate. Urine was clarified by centrifugation, sterilized, and spread onto the cells in the same way. As a control, PBS was used instead of a clinical specimen in triplicate wells. After incubation at 37 \u2022 C for 2 h, the infection solution was replaced with fresh Dulbecco minimum essential medium with 5% fetal calf serum (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cultures were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE) each day. At day 7, a blind passage was performed. The cells were collected by vigorously blowing the monolayer cells with the medium. The cell suspension was treated with three rounds of freeze-thaw conditions, clarified by centrifugation, and spread onto fresh Vero E6 cells. The blind passage was performed once each week for 3 weeks, and discarded if no CPE was observed. If CPE appeared, cells were collected for electron microscopy observation and RT-PCR identification. The isolation of SARS-CoV was confirmed by sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products.",

The amplified fragments were 109 and 156 bp in length and were confirmed to be parts of the SARS-CoV polymerase gene and N gene, respectively, by sequence analysis (Fig. 1) . Of 108 positive samples, 55 were double positive for both R and N gene fragment amplification. Individual single-positive amplification of R or N gene fragments was observed in 28 and 25 samples, respectively. Viral RNA was detectable in 42.1% (8/19) and 61.3% (19/31) of patients tested at week 1 and week 2 of illness, respectively. The detection profile of viral RNA from different specimens is shown in Fig. 2 . Specimens obtained from the respiratory tract were more likely than other specimens to yield viral RNA in the early stage of illness, with seven of eight tested patients (7 of 12 tested specimens) positive at week 1. During the convalescent phase of the infection (i.e., >4 weeks after disease onset), viral RNA was detected in different specimens of 10 of 32 (31.3%) patients. Figure 3 shows the dynamic seroconversion in cumulative percentages of patients with probable SARS. Because of the difficulties associated with clinical sample collection, only 148 plasma samples could be collected from 25 SARS patients during three consecutive weeks and tested for both SARS-CoV RNA and antibodies. Among these patients, 21 had detectable antibodies, and 12 had one or more specimens positive for viral RNA (Table 1) . Two patients (no. 1 and 10) were persistently positive for viral RNA in plasma up to 5-7 weeks after disease onset. It is notable that the coexistence of specific antibodies and viral RNA was observed for as long as 3 weeks in these two patients.",

Of these cases, 132 of the SARS patients were hospitalized and treated in our unit at the Beijing 302 Hospital, including the first cluster of case-patients in the area [19] . The criteria for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection are based on the following methods: SARS-CoV RNA detection by RT-PCR, serological detection of SARS-CoVrelated antibody, and isolation of SARS-CoV by cell culture [11, 20] . Table 1 Several assays have been developed to detect viral RNA using conventional nested RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. Though real-time RT-PCR assays have a quantitative advantage and are reported to have higher sensitivity/specificity in some cases, the requirements of expensive reagents and special instruments are obstacles preventing their widespread use in ordinary laboratories. During the crucial time span of the SARS epidemic, a real-time RT-PCR assay was still being developed. Therefore, conventional nested RT-PCR still served as a practicable assay at the time. The method using BNI outer/inner primers was reported to have a lower cost but similar sensitivity and specificity compared to three in-house real-time RT-PCR assays [21] . We observed that simultaneous employment of the primers targeting both R (ORF 1b) and N regions of SARS-CoV could increase the method's detection sensitivity. This finding is identical to that contained in a previous report by Bressler et al. [16] . These authors suggested that the N gene is present in all of the sub-genomic RNAs of SARS-CoV instead of in only one of them (ORF 1b of the R gene). However, we believe the major reason might be that most of the SARS-CoV is not intact in clinical specimens. Thus, amplification of different regions of SARS-CoV will increase the chance of detecting the disintegrated virus genome.",

False-positive reactions were observed in four of the stool specimens. Therefore, all positive results from the stool specimens of the SARS patients were confirmed by sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products. In addition, 64 of the 108 positive samples were amplified and sequenced for the S gene of SARS-CoV, and we confirmed that all of these samples contained S gene fragments of SARS-CoV [22] . Employing various specimens may increase the detection rate for viral RNA. In the present study, viral RNA was detectable in 42.1% (8/19) and 61.3% (19/31) of patients with probable SARS during week 1 and week 2 of illness, respectively. In contrast, specific antibodies against SARS-CoV were detectable in 0% (0/22) and 50% (27/54) of patients in the same respective weeks. Therefore, viral RNA detection is particularly valuable for early-stage diagnostics. However, false-positive results have to be carefully excluded, especially for stool specimens. Employment of nasopharyngeal aspirate collected by professional physicians and use of qualified real-time RT-PCR assays may increase the method's sensitivity/specificity [13] . From week 2 following disease onset, serology is the gold standard for identifying true-positive cases, since SARS-CoV is new to humans and we commonly lack immunity against it.",

Other investigators have reported that about half of their pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS failed to develop detectable antibodies specific against SARS-CoV [23] . Weak humoral immune response in pediatric SARS patients may be responsible for this unusual phenomenon. Since our observation of four other adult patients who did not seroconvert was terminated after 4-6 weeks of illness, and seroconversion can still occur during weeks 7 and 8 of illness [24] , one possible explanation for the negative antibody detection results may be a delayed antibody response. It is also possible that the antibody response of some patients is below the sensitivity of the ELISA test. However, considering that the SARS diagnosis in our patients was based on clinical manifestations and characteristics on chest radiograph during an emergency situation, clinical misdiagnosis of the patients who were negative for SARS-CoV RNA cannot be excluded.",
