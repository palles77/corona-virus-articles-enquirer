            "text": "For RNA viruses, most attention has been directed towards mutation, selection and genetic drift. We can understand their importance and interaction by considering four basic properties of RNA virus populations. First, RNA viruses often have very large population sizes, such that the number of viral particles in a given organism might be as high as 10 12 . Second, such immense population sizes, which are several orders of magnitude larger than those observed for cellular organisms, are a product of explosive replication. For example, a single infectious particle can produce an average of 100,000 viral copies in 10 hours. As natural selection is most efficient with large populations, it is no surprise that experiments using RNA viruses have shown that selection is of fundamental importance in controlling their evolutionary dynamics, such that new mutants with increased FITNESS (as measured by their selection coefficient, s) continually appear and out-compete older, inferior alleles 4 . Third, owing to the lack of proofreading activity in their polymerase proteins, RNA viruses exhibit the highest mutation rates of any group of organisms, approximately one mutation per genome, per replication 5, 6 . Finally, the genome sizes of RNA viruses are typically small, ranging from only 3 kb to ~30 kb, with a median size of 9 kb. These last two properties are intimately related because high-mutation rates are theoretically expected to limit genome size. In particular, a mutation rate that exceeds a notional ERROR THRESHOLD (set at approximately the reciprocal of the genome size) generates so many deleterious mutations in each replication cycle that even the fittest viral genomes are unable to reproduce, and population size decreases to extinction 7, 8 . However, RNA viruses that exist close to (but below) the error threshold are also THE POPULATION GENETICS AND EVOLUTIONARY EPIDEMIOLOGY OF RNA VIRUSES population that would experience genetic drift in the same way as the actual population. N e can be lower than the census population size (N) owing to various factors, including a history of population bottlenecks and variance in reproductive rates.",

The remarkable mutational power of RNA viruses has meant that their evolution has often been considered to be different to DNA-based organisms 1 . Key to this is the concept of the quasispecies, which was first developed by Eigen and Schuster 16 to understand the dynamics of primitive evolutionary systems. RNA viruses are of particular importance in this respect as they might represent biological entities that evolve according to the rules of quasispecies theory. The basis of quasispecies theory is the notion that the target of natural selection is not simply the fastest growing replicator, but rather a broad spectrum of mutants that are produced by erroneous copying of the fittest (or master) sequence 16, 17 . Natural selection acts on the entire quasispecies because mutation rates close to the error threshold mean that individual viral genomes are linked by a mutational coupling -all the possible mutational links between viral genomes are established -so that the whole population evolves as a single unit. One particularly important implication of this special form of group selection is that the fastest replicating RNA viral genomes could be out-competed by those with lower replication rates if the latter have a high probability of being generated by mutation from closely related variants.",

Experimental evidence for the quasispecies was first reported for the bacteriophage Q\u03b2 18 . Subsequent experiments with mammalian vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) provided one of the most important supporting observations for the quasispecies -a high-fitness viral variant was suppressed by one of lower fitness 19 . However, this can also be explained by genetic drift; the probability that any variant achieves fixation in a population is partially dependent on its initial frequency, so most rare, albeit advantageous, variants are lost by drift in small populations. Indeed, a generic problem of quasispecies theory is that genetic drift is expected to be extremely restricted 17 , which might not be the case for viruses in Nature 20,21 . More recently, in vitro studies of the evolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage \u03c66 provided evidence for one aspect of quasispecies theory -that viral genomes differ in their mutational spectra and that this affects fitness 22 . However, because these experiments used small populations and RUGGED FITNESS LANDSCAPES, and because little is known about fitness landscapes in Nature, the generality of these results in uncertain.",

In particular, deterministic approaches assume that population sizes are universally large, such that the fate of a given mutation can be predicted if its frequency and fitness are known. Although the population sizes of RNA viruses are often very large, factors such as variation in replication potential among variants, differences in generation time among infected cells and POPULATION BOTTLENECKS, most notably during transmission between hosts, might lead to an EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZE (denoted N e ) that is much smaller than the actual number of infected cells.

Although most studies indicate that recombination rates in many RNA viruses are often lower than those in other organisms 10 , there are notable exceptions. Perhaps the most dramatic is HIV, in which the genomic recombination rate exceeds the genomic mutation rate 11 . Frequent recombination seems advantageous because it can create high fitness genotypes more rapidly than by mutation alone. Moreover, recombination might also purge deleterious mutations from virus populations, thereby preventing a dramatic decrease in fitness (see below). However, simulation studies have indicated that frequent recombination is more likely to reduce fitness when mutation rates are close to the error threshold 12 . Finally, recombination rates in RNA viruses might not be set by natural selection at all. Rather, they could simply be a passive function of the replication machinery or ecological circumstances of the virus in question. For example, recombination rates seem to be particularly low in negative-sense RNA viruses 13 , which might be a result of the RNA-packaging mechanism. Understanding the causes of variation in recombination rate among RNA viruses is a key area for future study.",

First, the molecular basis of adaptive evolution in viruses, including the occurrence and frequency of CONVERGENT EVOLUTION 26, 27 , viral attenuation 28 and compensatory mutations 29 . Second, the role of population bottlenecks and the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and how they affect fitness [30] [31] [32] [33] . Finally, the importance of CLONAL INTERFERENCE 34 and COMPLEMENTATION 35 in determining rates of viral adaptation. In brief, these studies make eight conclusions 36 . First, there is extensive convergent and parallel evolution (both in genotype and in phenotype) across lineages replicating in the same host, perhaps reflecting the fact that relatively few sites are free to vary when genome sizes are small. Second, advantageous mutations that are fixed early on when viruses are challenged with new environments confer the largest fitness benefit. Third, phenotypic evolution tends to mirror the evolution of fitness increments, with large changes occurring early in new environments. Fourth, rates of nucleotide substitution remain approximately constant through time. Fifth, overall genetic diversity remains low during the phase of maximum fitness increase and rises once fitness becomes asymptotic. Sixth, evolutionary changes that increase fitness in one host often, although not always, reduce fitness in an alternative host. Seventh, population bottlenecks and spatial heterogeneity lead to an increase in unique nucleotide substitutions. Finally, severe reductions in population size can lead to the accumulation of deleterious mutations and consequent fitness losses.",

One of the first questions addressed concerned a severe consequence of deleterious mutation accumulation known as MULLER'S RATCHET 37 . Studies have explored how clonally evolving RNA viruses prevent the excessive build-up of deleterious mutations in populations that are experiencing strong bottlenecks or small effective sizes 38 . One popular suggestion is that sexual reproduction has evolved in RNA viruses, because it allows them to escape Muller's ratchet when effective population sizes are small [39] [40] [41] . In this model, the accumulation of deleterious mutations is expected to be less of a problem for RNA viruses that either recombine or undergo reassortment in the case of viruses with segmented genomes. However, recombination rates are often so low in RNA viruses that it is difficult to hypothesize that they have a direct fitness benefit. In the face of low populations as a unit. Testing this prediction in Nature will be one of the most important future areas of study for those investigating the mechanics of viral evolution.",

Since this time, the analysis of gene sequence variation has become a standard practice for virologists with an interest in epidemiology, especially with the advent of new, high-throughput sequencing technologies. From the typing of viral populations to the study of the origins of a new virus, viral gene sequence variation has been used to answer a wide variety of questions, increasing both the quantity and quality of the epidemiological data available. In this section, we discuss how particular aspects of RNA virus evolution affect the reconstruction of their epidemiological history. In this context, it is important to note that the observed epidemiological patterns of viruses result from their evolution at two different levels: within individual hosts 54 (and vectors 55 ) and among hosts at the population level. RNA viruses differ greatly in their patterns and processes of intra-and inter-host evolution, as well as in the duration of the infection caused and the type of immune response that is induced. Such factors must be considered when discussing their epidemiological dynamics in a comparative setting 3 .",

The timescale of these trees can vary from a few weeks to many centuries, and depends on the rate of accumulation of variation in the sequences under study and the timescale of sampling. Although graphically very similar, there are important differences between phylogenetic trees and gene genealogies 56 . The former are used to analyse the evolutionary history of distinct viral species or genes, usually by sampling one representative of each unit under study. By contrast, genealogies depict the history of genetic polymorphisms segregating in contemporaneous populations. Gene genealogies have been used extensively in the study of RNA viruses recombination rates, RNA viruses could escape Muller's ratchet because their long-term effective population sizes might not be small enough to allow deleterious mutations to accumulate, or perhaps compensatory mutations are sufficiently frequent to counteract fitness losses 42 . Experimental evolution with RNA viruses has also been crucial for studying the dynamics of natural selection. This has been the case, for instance, in studies of COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION 43 , the RED QUEEN HYPOTHESIS 43 , convergent evolution 26, 27, 44 and the rhythm of adaptive change 45 . We expect RNA viruses to continue to have an important role in this area for many years to come. Finally, one promising area involves using RNA viruses to test theories for the evolution of cooperation. For example, Turner and Chao conducted a series of experiments with bacteriophage \u03c66 in which they demonstrated that RNA viruses could evolve under PRISONER'S DILEMMA conditions 46 , and also escape from it 47 .",

Digital organisms have the ability to create a copy of their own genome, but are subject to copying errors, so that populations of programs evolve in, and adapt to, their environments 48 . Although digital organisms are not as sophisticated as viruses, they are useful study tools because experiments can be easily controlled and repeated. Digital organisms have been useful in studying predicted adaptive evolution over short and long timescales 49,50 , the role of epistasis in evolution 51 and testing key aspects of quasispecies theory, particularly whether fast replicators can be less fit than slower replicators at high-mutation rates 52 .",

In this case, the prosecutor's hypothesis was that each patient was infected at the hospital. Conversely, the defendant's hypothesis was that each patient became separately infected from the general population. These two proposals translate into different phylogenetic tree topologies, the likelihoods of which can be compared directly. The prosecutor's proposal is equivalent to observing a monophyletic group comprising the infected patients, which is significantly distinct from the background population, whereas the defendant's proposal corresponds to the grouping of the sequences from each infected patient with those of the background population. This molecular analysis proved that all the individuals were from a single outbreak, and was the first report of the use of molecular phylogenies to determine the likelihood of a patient sharing the source of infection with other infected patients. essential for the identification of positive 72, 73 , or purifying 74 , natural selection at nucleotide sites, the presence and extent of recombination 13, 75, 76 and for dating important points in the history of epidemics 67,77,78 .

Indeed, present data indicate that viral substitution rates are much more variable than their underlying mutation rates 5,6 , which is most likely a reflection of important differences in replication dynamics. For example, the nucleotide substitution rate in human T-lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) varies from ~1 \u00d7 10 -4 substitutions per site per year in epidemics with high rates of transmission and where replication is rapid, such as those in injecting drug users, to ~1 \u00d7 10 -7 substitutions per site per year in endemic situations, where viruses are maintained within hosts through the clonal expansion of infected cells rather than by active replication 83 . However, in many RNA viruses, substitution rates of 1 \u00d7 10 -3 to 1 \u00d7 10 -4 substitutions per site per year are observed 82 . The variation in substitution rates across viral genomes has benefits, because it allows different epidemiological questions to be addressed, relating to different temporal scales. So, rapidly evolving (hypervariable) gene regions are informative for studying viral evolution within individuals, or for identifying the source of a particular disease outbreak. More conserved regions are better suited for in-depth phylogenetic inference, from analysing viral genotypes at the species to family levels.",

Indeed, RNA viruses constitute the most important class of measurably evolving populations 57 , with evolution even occurring during the infection of a single individual 58 . More accurate methods of evolutionary inference have already been designed for these rapidly evolving populations 59-61 . In particular, whereas phylogenetic trees generally depict strictly bifurcating patterns of relationships, gene genealogies can take into account recombination, which will lead to interconnected networks of lineages. Moreover, using a statistical approach called coalescent theory 62-64 , it is possible to infer demographic processes from genetic polymorphism data, most notably, rates of viral population growth and decline. Coalescent methods can operate under several population genetic models and use gene genealogies as key analytical tools. Coalescent theory therefore provides a crucial conceptual link between phylogenetics and population genetics.",

An important ecological factor in HIV emergence involves the bushmeat trade in west Africa. Not only have a wide range of related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) been isolated from animal carcasses 101 , but the bushmeat trade has increased owing to encroachment by humans on the ranges occupied by non-human primates. The SIV that is found in chimpanzees (SIVcpz) is the closest relative, and therefore the most likely ancestor, of human HIV-1 (REF. 102 ), whereas SIVsm from sooty mangabeys seems to be the reservoir population for HIV-2 (REF. 103 ). For both HIV-1 and HIV-2, there have been multiple transfers of virus from their reservoirs into humans, with these viruses most likely establishing themselves in humans during the last century 67,77 . Also of importance, was the movement of individuals infected early in the epidemic from small, isolated rural populations to cities in Africa 103 , which enabled incipient epidemic strains to reach a large number of susceptible hosts. Yet, genetics is also likely to have been important in the emergence of HIV. In particular, phylogenetic studies indicate that SIVs are most easily transmissable among related primate hosts 104 , implying that not all possible instances of cross-species viral transmission that could occur do occur, and that adaptive constraints might exist.",

Although RNA viruses are the group of pathogens that seem most able to cross species boundaries 94 , perhaps because high mutation rates provide them with an increased capacity to adapt to new hosts 95 , not all RNA viruses are equally equipped in this respect. For example, in many cases, RNA viruses (such as rabies virus infection in humans) establish 'dead-end' infections in specific hosts, without subsequent transmission, which reflects imperfect adaptation. This indicates that there are constraints that inhibit viral adaptation to new hosts, perhaps owing to the fitness trade-offs that seem commonplace in viruses that need to infect different hosts or cell types 25, 96 . Therefore, infecting different hosts is likely to represent a major adaptive challenge for RNA viruses, despite their mutation rate. Examples are animal vector-borne viruses, which are less subject to adaptive evolution than their non-vector-borne counterparts, presumably owing to the difficulties that are associated with simultaneous replication in hosts as divergent as invertebrates and vertebrates 97 . If extended over longer periods of time, this will lead to a phylogenetic rule of cross-species transmission, such that the greater the evolutionary distance between hosts, the lower the probability of viral transfer among them 98 .",

Consequently, animal species that live at high densities, such as some bats, rodents and birds, are most likely to be reservoirs, particularly those animal populations that already live in close proximity to humans. Less intuitively, if there is a relationship between the breadth of cell tropism and the number of species infected, most attention should be given to those viruses that infect several cell types. More importantly, a comprehensive survey of RNA virus diversity should be undertaken in appropriate animal species. This can be done through the use of degenerate PCR primers that have been designed for several RNA virus families, followed by studies to determine whether the viruses will grow in human cells. Similar approaches have already uncovered a plethora of new virus families from marine environments 111 . and SARS-CoV is so large that SARS-CoV has clearly experienced a long period of independent evolution. Studies of animals sold at Chinese markets have detected antibodies in a number of mammalian species 107 . Most notably, viruses obtained from the Himalayan palm civet (a member of the Viverridae) are closely related to human strains of SARS-CoV. Whether this species represents the main reservoir for SARS-CoV is still unclear. Finally, there have also been suggestions that SARS-CoV is a recombinant of mammalian and avian coronaviruses and that this genetic event might have trigged viral emergence 108 . However, because the sequences involved are so divergent, the phylogenetic incongruence in trees of SARS-CoV seems more likely to be due to variation in the molecular clock than inter-coronavirus recombination.",

Consequently, advantageous mutations, most notably those that confer antigenic escape, are able to be fixed in the virus population in a regular manner 121 . By contrast, population-level selection seems to be considerably weaker in the sexually transmitted HIV, although some evidence for long-term cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated selection has been found 122 . This contrasts with intra-host HIV evolution, in which immune-driven natural selection is the dominant evolutionary process 72, 123, 124 . The reduced impact of selection at the population level is most likely to be caused by extensive variation in rates of partner exchange, which in turn reduces the effective population size 125 , and because there is a large bottleneck at transmission 126 . Therefore, for HIV, intra-host and inter-host evolution seem to be largely decoupled. Although fewer studies have compared intra-and inter-host evolution in acute RNA virus infections, a recent analysis of dengue virus indicated that most amino acid changes that arise within hosts are deleterious in the long term 74 .",

Similarly, if the evolutionary process differs greatly within and among hosts, a selectively favoured level of virulence within hosts might be disadvantageous among hosts.

If there is a fitness cost, we would hypothesize that resistance mutations would not reach high frequencies in populations, despite their benefit to the virus in hosts. There is evidence that, in the absence of the drug, HIV strains harbouring drug-resistant mutations are less fit than wild-type HIV strains 118 .
