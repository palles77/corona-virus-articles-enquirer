Here is how we performed calibration. The simulation needs a starting assumed number of cases, and we initially used the value 100. Here is why. Previously we had estimated that the Chicago community cluster was 1600 infected individuals on March 14 2020. The way we did that estimate was to work backwards from the number of ICU confirmed covid-19 patients at a major Chicago hospital (5 confirmed, 110 persons under investigation (PUIs) but 10% of those will turn out to be covid-19 positive). Then we used the doubling time of 2.3 days which was true at that time, and used a 20% hospitalization rate for covid-19 patients, with a time interval between infection and hospitalization of 9.9 days. Then we found that this cluster originated around February 19 2020.",

            "text": "However, we were not satisfied with this argument, because it predicted the first covid-19 confirmed case would be too late. To do this, we experimented with moving the starting time of the simulation with one infected individual, and found that this would work if the date of infection was February 16 th 2020. Reassuringly, this date is roughly consistent with the working backwards calculation! We ran the simulations with this initial condition: one infection event on Feb 16 th 2020. Starting with this value, our simulations predicted that on March 18 2020, between 38 and 40 people would be hospitalized, with 5 patients in ICU. At that time, the data available indicated at least 18 ICU patients (of which 11 were a cluster at a single hospital) and at least 19 non-critical hospitalized patients. We regarded this agreement as satisfactory within the uncertainties inherent in computer simulation at the population level with such small numbers of cases. Now we need to comment about the R0 parameter used in the simulations. There is no real consensus on the right value for R0 at this stage in the infection, so we experimented to find a value that replicated the observed doubling time of about 2.1-2.5 days in Illinois (Figure 1 ). We found that we could match the emergence of the infection in Illinois with an R0 = 4.0 (annual average), latency = 5 days, infectious period = 3 days, seasonal forcing strength 0.2 and seasonal peak in January. This value is within the ranges reported in an extensive epidemiological study [10] .",

This is supposed to represent Chicago (not the Chicago Metropolitan Area). We calibrated the model to match the observed epidemiological statistics. We found that the \"patient zero\" who started the local cluster was infected around Feb 16 2020. The parameters of the model were selected to reproduce the observed doubling time of 2.0 days for reported cases in Illinois (Figure 1) . The model predicts a current situation of 40 hospitalized non-critical patients, and 5 patients in ICU across Chicago. From a sample of three large hospitals in Chicago there are at least 19 hospitalized noncritical patients and additional 18 in ICU. Due to the inevitable uncertainties in computer modeling and the chance events that dictate early infections, we regard this agreement as satisfactory. The most important thing is that our simulations are calibrated to reproduce well the growth trend, so that we can predict the future course of the epidemic.",

We ran two simulations with the parameter R0 = 0.9, probably the least severe mitigation that one can do which is guaranteed to eventually end the COVID-19 epidemic. In one simulation (the \"late mitigation\" scenario), shown by the red curve, the mitigation was fully implemented by April 20 th 2020. In the other, shown by the blue curve (the \"just-in-time mitigation\" scenario), the mitigation was fully implemented by April 1 st 2020. The implementation of the mitigations was assumed to ramp up gradually over a period of time, and the strong steps already taken in Illinois are part of this mitigation and included in the calculation. Further mitigations are no doubt possible, and strong mitigation would be the final additional step.",

We note that in both Wuhan and Italy, strong mitigation measures were taken such as lockdown, but they were taken too late and still resulted in thousands of lives lost, including those of healthcare professionals. As the epidemic develops along its inevitable exponential growth trajectory, it is equally inevitable that leadership will eventually be forced to implement lockdown. Thus, if this is going to happen anyway, it should be taken as early as possible.",

Of course, one cannot be sure that the dates and course of the epidemic are going to follow the precise predictions we have made. There are inevitable uncertainties in making predictions for such a powerful phenomenon as an epidemic. However, whether the outcomes predicted by our scenarios occur on exactly the dates given here, and with exactly the numbers provided here, they will occur as we have predicted. The window that we have predicted is rather short, perhaps two weeks at the longest. Thus to be safe, the mitigation measures should be implemented as soon as possible, while they will be effective; at the same time, for humanitarian reasons, the societal implications of lockdown require appropriate arrangements to be made for the city's population, as has already done for the mitigation efforts to date.",

            "text": "This work would not have been possible without the generous assistance of many individuals who contributed their expertise, guidance and technical assistance. We used an outstanding simulation of the SEIR model of epidemics (COVID-19 Scenario Explorer) with parameters and features appropriate for COVID-19, developed by Ivan Aksamentov, Nicholas Noll and Richard Neher at the University of Basel, and used with their permission. This scenario explorer was customized for us by Nicholas Noll (University of California at Santa Barbara and University of Basel) and Zhiru Liu (Stanford University). We benefitted from numerous discussions with the following individuals: David Ansell and Bala Hota at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago; Mark Johnson at Carle Hospital, Urbana; Alexei Tkachenko at Brookhaven National Laboratory.",
