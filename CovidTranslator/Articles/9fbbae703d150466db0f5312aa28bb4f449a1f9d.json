Currently, most of the applications are focused on target-specific amplification. Because RPA has the advantage of amplifying DNA under isothermal conditions, we utilized RPA as a DNA library amplification tool. In this study, we used a sheared genomic DNA library and an oligonucleotide (oligo) library for the comparison of polymerase chain reaction and RPA. For the sheared DNA library, we observed biased amplification after RPA was conducted. Thus, to amplify the sizevariable DNA library uniformly, we introduced a linear amplification strategy with RPA and successfully improved the uniformity. On the other hand, using the same-sized oligo library, we confirmed that RPA amplified this library uniformly without modification of the protocol. These results demonstrate that RPA can be applied not only to amplify a specific target as previously demonstrated but also to amplify a complex DNA library composed of a large number of different DNA molecules.",

The mechanism of RPA is similar to that of PCR. First, the recombinase and primer form a complex and attach to the target site. Then, the polymerase recognizes the primer and extends through the template DNA. During extension, single-stranded DNA-binding proteins attach to the opposite strand to stabilize the RPA reaction intermediate. RPA has two advantages over PCR\ue0d5reaction temperature and reaction time. RPA usually proceeds between 37 and 42\u00b0C under isothermal conditions, which is advantageous for instrument-free field diagnosis and prevention of heat-induced DNA mutations. The reaction time for RPA is typically 15 2 or 20\u221240 min based on the manufacturer's protocol, which is shorter than most PCR reactions. Because of these advantages, RPA is used for detection and diagnosis of specific bacteria 2\u22124 and viruses. 5\u22128 Moreover, RPA can be conducted on solidphase materials, 9\u221211 including lateral flow dipstick, 10,12\u221214 which permits the technique to be used in point-of-care tests.",

            "text": "Studies have examined replacing existing PCR-based molecular biology techniques with RPA-based techniques. For example, allele-specific RPA is performed for genotyping SNPs using 19-base pair (bp) to 21 bp primers designed in silico. 15 Blocked RPA uses wild-type binding blocked oligo and mutation-specific amplification, 16 and miRPA detection is performed by amplifying two ligated probes using the target miRNA as a splint oligo. 17 In addition, digital droplet RPA reduces the reaction time to 30 min by replacing the amplification method from PCR to RPA. 18 Another example is multiplex RPA, which detects multiple pathogens simultaneously using multiple primer pairs. 19, 20 With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, the importance of error-free and unbiased DNA library amplification is becoming increasingly important. To achieve a reduced error rate and unbiased amplification, the researchers proposed several different methods. For example, researchers compared the fidelity of DNA polymerase 21 and used high-fidelity DNA polymerase to reduce the error which was generated during DNA amplification. Other researchers used molecular DNA barcode to remove the DNA duplicate 22 and amplification bias. 23, 24 However, most of the methods used PCR as a DNA amplification method, which has a chance to induce heat-related damages such as deamination of cytosine to uracil. 25 We hypothesized that replacing PCR with RPA can reduce these heat-related damages. Thus, in this study, we applied RPA to amplify the DNA library and designed several experiments to properly implement it. We amplified sheared DNA and an oligonucleotide DNA library using RPA and identified the appropriate RPA method for each DNA library. Through this study, we show that RPA is suitable for NGS sample amplification, further broadening the potential applications of the RPA method.",

Thus, if the percentage was higher, the sample was amplified more uniformly. Using the above calculation, we calculated the percentage of uniform range of small and large DNA libraries which showed 76.6 and 84.0% of bases in the uniform range, respectively. By contrast, the RPA amplicons from small and large DNA libraries showed 56.3 and 49.2%, respectively ( Figure S5 ). We assumed that the size shift might be due to faster amplification of small-sized DNA by RPA versus PCR. Thus, the difference in the size-dependent amplification rate caused biased amplification with reduced uniformity. Linear Amplification RPA Improves the Uniformity and Size Variation of DNA Libraries. To solve the size shift and lower uniformity problem, we examined single-primer linear RPA as a potential solution to the size shift problem of DNA libraries amplified with two-primer RPA. We hypothesized that a single primer would prevent reamplification of the RPA amplicon by the opposite primer, blocking acceleration of small-sized DNA amplification. Moreover, because of the strand displacement activity of RPA, large DNA should be amplified simultaneously in multiple strands. Taken together, to improve the size shift and uniformity, we adopted a singleprimer linear amplification strategy. 30 To test our hypothesis, we amplified E. coli small (n = 3) and large (n = 3) libraries using single-primer linear RPA, which we refer to as linear RPA ( Figure 1 ). After adaptor ligation and USER treatment of E. coli libraries, 20 min of linear RPA was performed with the P7 index primer (Table S3) . A short cycle of PCR was performed with the P5 index and P7 end primers to attach the P5 index for NGS. We confirmed the size distribution of products by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to performing NGS and found broader size distributions ( Figure S4 ) than that obtained with two-primer RPA ( Figure S2 ). Amplified libraries were sequenced with the Illumina NextSeq platform and analyzed as above. From the analysis result, the size distribution and uniformity of linear RPA products were improved compared with products from two-primer RPA (Figure 2 ). The average size distributions of the triplet experiment with the small and large libraries were 56 bp and 45 bp, respectively, by RPA and 90 bp and 109 bp, respectively, by linear RPA (Figure 2a) . Also, the average percentages of bases in the uniform range (uniformity value between 0.5 and 1.5) about the triplet experiment was improved from 56.3 and 49.2% by two-primer RPA to 73.6 and 75.7% by linear RPA for the small and large DNA libraries, respectively (Figures 2b and S5) .",

One thousand insert sequences with 90 bp were extracted from the genomic DNA sequence of Synechocystis sp PCC 6803. We conducted RPA and PCR for 20 min and 25 cycles, respectively, with 20 ng oligo library in each reaction as a template (n = 3). Agarose gel electrophoresis showed the correct amplicon size with both methods ( Figure S7 ). After NGS sample preparation with eight cycles of index attachment PCR, the samples were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform. Sequencing data for both the PCR and RPA oligo library amplicons were analyzed using BWA, Samtools, and inhouse python codes. We assessed the uniformity of the PCR and RPA amplicons by calculating the uniformity value (sequencing depth of the single oligo/average depth of all 1000 oligos) of each oligo in the library. All replicate experiments are visualized on a dot plot showing the uniformity values (Figure 3a) . Results indicated that 77.0% of oligos were in the uniform range (uniformity value 0.5\u22121.5) after PCR amplification, and 63.2% of oligos were in the uniform range by RPA.",

However, during the experiment, an accelerated small-sized DNA amplification by two-primer RPA reaction caused lower uniformity compared to PCR. To solve this problem, we adapted a linear amplification strategy. We hypothesized that the single-primer linear RPA would result in unbiased, singlestranded DNA amplicons by the strand displacement activity of RPA. As a result, we were able to obtain the more uniform products compared to two-primer RPA products. Nevertheless, the size distribution was not superior compared to PCR products.
