Like Listeria and Shigella, which use specific mechanisms to avoid autophagic detection and capture, the bacterial pathogen Francisella tularensis proliferates within the cytosol of macrophages without demonstrable control by autophagy. To examine how Francisella evades autophagy, we screened a library of F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 HimarFT transposon mutants in GFP-LC3-expressing murine macrophages by microscopy for clones localised within autophagic vacuoles after phagosomal escape. Eleven clones showed autophagic capture at six hours postinfection, whose HimarFT insertions clustered to four genetic loci involved in lipopolysaccharidic and capsular O-antigen biosynthesis. Consistent with the HimarFT mutants, in-frame deletion mutants of two representative loci, FTT1236 and FTT1448c (manC), lacking both LPS and capsular O-antigen, underwent phagosomal escape but were cleared from the host cytosol. Unlike wild type Francisella, the O-antigen deletion mutants were ubiquitinated, and recruited the autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1 and LC3 prior to cytosolic clearance. Autophagy-deficient macrophages partially supported replication of both mutants, indicating that O-antigen-lacking Francisella are controlled by autophagy.

Autophagy, a highly conserved process among eukaryotes, delivers cytoplasmic material to the lysosomal compartment for degradation. While initially described as a nonselective, bulk degradation pathway of cytosolic content up-regulated in response to nutrient deprivation, autophagy serves numerous other functions, including the removal of obsolete organelles, misfolded proteins, and the selective degradation of cytosolic pathogens (Yang et al., 2010) . In its innate immune role, autophagy is used to degrade and clear invading organisms following their tagging as autophagic cargo via ubiquitination (Kraft et al., 2010) . After initial targeting, the ubiquitinated cargo is recognized by autophagy adapter molecules such as p62/ SQSTM1 or NDP52, which in turn enroll autophagy complexes via binding to Atg8/LC3family proteins, thereby recruiting nascent autophagosomes (phagophores) (Pankiv et al., 2007 , von Muhlinen et al., 2010 , Zheng et al., 2009 , Gal et al., 2009 . Autophagosome elongation and closure around the targeted bacterium are orchestrated by various ubiquitin conjugation-like molecular complexes, including the ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L complex and LC3, and leads to sequestration of the pathogen from the cytosol and its subsequent degradation through lysosomal fusion.",

            "text": "Unlike intracellular pathogens that reside within a membrane-bound vacuole, bacteria that disrupt their original phagosome to reach, and replicate in, the host cell cytosol are targets of antibacterial autophagy. Therefore, their ability to survive and proliferate in this compartment must invoke specific mechanisms of autophagy avoidance. Indeed, the cytosolic pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri either modify their surface by recruiting host proteins to mask themselves from autophagic recognition (Dortet et al., 2011 , Yoshikawa et al., 2009 , or secrete a specific protein that interferes with the autophagic cascade on the bacterial surface (Ogawa et al., 2005) . Similar to Listeria and Shigella, the tularemia-causing bacterium Francisella tularensis is a cytosolic pathogen that rapidly disrupts its phagosome upon uptake by macrophages (Clemens et al., 2004 , Checroun et al., 2006 . It then undergoes extensive replication between 4 to 16 hours postinfection without any apparent restriction from the host cell (Wehrly et al., 2009) . While a fraction of cytosolic Francisella may translocate into autophagy-related vacuoles after several hours (> 16 h post-infection) in murine macrophages (Checroun et al., 2006) , most bacteria successfully reside and proliferate within the cytosol for a protracted length of time without triggering an autophagy response. Additionally, replication-deficient Francisella mutants with eventual survival defects can still persist in the cytosol for up to 10 hours before recognition and clearance by antibacterial autophagy (Chong et al., 2012) , arguing for an inherent ability to deflect targeting by selective autophagy. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that Francisella actively avoids autophagic recognition early during its infection cycle and set out to identify genes required for autophagy evasion after entry in the host cytosol. Here we report that F. tularensis strains that lack the surface polysaccharidic O-antigen are susceptible to autophagic capture upon entering the host cytosol, and consequently fail to survive and proliferate efficiently. This study ascribes an additional immune evasion function to Francisella O-antigen and describes a bacterial surface polysaccharide as a shield against autophagic recognition.",

Immortalized bone marrow-derived murine macrophages (iBMM) that stably express the autophagosome marker GFP-LC3 were infected in 96-well glass-bottom plates with individual transposon mutant clones at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100:1. Approximately 6,400 individual insertion mutants were screened for colocalization with GFP-LC3 by fluorescence microscopy at 6 hours postinfection (h post-infection), a time point ensuring complete phagosomal escape but no substantial replication of bacteria. Eleven clones (0.17% of the mutants screened) triggered formation of GFP-LC3-positive vacuoles and were weakly stained by anti-Francisella LPS antibodies. All repeatedly showed detectable targeting to GFP-LC3-positive vacuoles (Fig. 1A) and to LC3-positive vacuoles in primary murine BMMs when counterstained with DAPI ( Fig 4E) . In addition to their localization to autophagic vacuoles, all 11 clones also exhibited increased uptake by iBMMs relative to wild type Schu S4 (Fig. 1A) .",

The remaining mutants had transposon insertions in either the CMP-KDO synthase kdsB (FTT1478c) gene, or upstream of the FTT0804-capBCA locus (Fig. 1B) . Using antibodies directed against either the Francisella LPS O-antigen or the Francisella O-antigen-derived capsule, we found that all mutants lacked both a complete LPS and capsular O-antigens (Fig. 1C) , which share the same molecular identity (Apicella et al., 2010) . Based on their LPS expression patterns (Fig. 1C) , and by comparison to other characterized O-antigen mutants (Raynaud et al., 2007 , Gunn et al., 2007 , Lai et al., 2010 , insertion mutants in the manBC, and FTT0804 loci likely possess a defective core polysaccharide, while the FTT1236, FTT1237 and kdsB mutants do not express any detectable C) . Given the similar phenotypes of all eleven mutants identified in the screen, we generated in-frame deletion mutants of Schu S4 in either FTT1236 or manC, the most frequently identified genes in our screen, as mutants representative of each O-antigen phenotype for further characterization.",

Previous studies have shown that O-antigen mutants of F. novicida do not enter host macrophages via looping phagocytosis (Lai et al., 2010) , an uptake process of wild type bacteria that depends on the presence of active complement in the infection medium (Clemens, et al., 2012) . To avoid any confounding effects possibly resulting from differential uptake mechanisms of the \u0394FTT1236 and \u0394manC and wild type strains, our experiments were conducted in absence of active complement. Under these conditions, we examined the cytotoxic effects of our mutant strains on BMMs and confirmed increased cytotoxicity at 16, but not at 4 h post-infection ( Fig. 2B ), when using an MOI (50:1). However, decreasing the MOI to 5 or less for the mutants normalized uptake levels to those of Schu S4 at an MOI of 50 ( Fig. 2C -D) and significantly decreased cytotoxicity at 16 h post-infection ( Fig. 2B ; p< 0.05). Using adjusted MOIs that avoid cytotoxic effects, we then examined the intracellular fate of the \u0394FTT1236 and \u0394manC strains in murine BMMs. Unlike Schu S4 (MOI of 50), which grew by 2 Log over a 24 h period, the number of recoverable CFUs of both mutants (MOI of 1-3) progressively decreased, indicating their inability to survive intracellularly ( Fig. 2C-D) . Complementation of both mutations fully restored the bacteria's ability to replicate ( Fig. 2C-D) . Hence, the failure of \u0394FTT1236 and \u0394manC mutants to survive inside murine macrophages demonstrates that O-antigen expression is essential for survival and replication in these cells.",

Decrease in bacterial colocalization with LAMP1 in the first hour pi, a readout of phagosomal disruption, was comparable between Schu S4, the \u0394FTT1236 and \u0394manC mutants and a \u0394dipA mutant that is competent for phagosomal escape (Chong et al., 2012) (Fig. 3A and S1A), indicating that both O-antigen mutants are capable of normal phagosomal escape. In comparison, a phagosomal escape-deficient \u0394fevR mutant (Wehrly et al., 2009 ) remained within LAMP1-positive vacuoles over a 10 h period ( Fig. 3A and S1A). In agreement, ultrastructural analyses of these strains at 1 h post-infection showed an absence of phagosomal membranes around Schu S4 and both O-antigen mutants, while \u0394fevR bacteria remained surrounded by intact membranes (Fig. 3B , and S2). Additionally, 79% and 92% of \u0394FTT1236 (n=72) and \u0394manC (n=25) bacteria observed, respectively, lacked the electron-translucent layer normally seen around Schu S4 (78%, n=27) ( Fig. 3B and S2), suggesting it is formed by the polysaccharidic O-antigen. Interestingly, while Schu S4 and the \u0394dipA mutant remained cytosolic over a 10 h infection course, colocalization of both O-antigen mutants with LAMP1 increased after 1 h post-infection to reach 58 \u00b1 7.9% of \u0394 FTT1236 and 48 \u00b1 6.5% of \u0394manC bacteria by 10 h post-infection, indicating rapid reentry of these mutants into the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. This early re-entry into LAMP1-positive vacuoles is unique to these O-antigen mutants and distinct from the autophagosomal capture described for the \u0394dipA mutant, which is delayed until 16 h postinfection (Chong et al., 2012) . Taken together, our results suggest that O-antigen mutants are quickly captured by autophagy following their initial escape into the cytosol.",

Unlike Schu S4, the \u0394fevR or \u0394dipA strains, the O-antigen mutants displayed a rapidly increasing colocalization with ubiquitin ( Fig. 4A-B) , the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1 (Fig. 4C -D) and LC3 ( Fig. 4E -F) between 1 and 2 h post-infection, which slowly decreased afterwards. Similar colocalization of mutants with these autophagy markers was observed in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages ( Fig. S3 ), indicating that autophagic targeting of O-antigen mutants is comparable in both human and murine macrophages. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cytosolic Francisella lacking the O-antigen are rapidly recognized by the autophagy pathway and targeted to the lysosomal compartment. Since neither wild type bacteria, the \u0394dipA nor \u0394fevR mutants, which all express normal LPS O-antigen and capsule (Fig. S1C-D), were targeted by autophagy early after infection, this suggests that the surface O-antigen prevents Francisella from rapid autophagic recognition once it reaches the cytosol.",

We then assessed autophagic targeting and capture of the O-antigen mutants using Bafilomycin-A 1 (BAF), which delays escape of F. tularensis for up to 4 h post-infection (Chong et al., 2008) . Pretreatment of BMMs with BAF increased the fraction of vacuolar, LAMP1-positive SchuS4 and O-antigen mutants at 2 h post-infection ( Fig. S4B ), confirming impaired phagosomal escape (Chong et al., 2008) . Under these conditions, the association of both O-antigen mutants with ubiquitin, p62/SQSTM1 and LC3 was significantly reduced ( Fig. S4C -E), indicating that phagosomal escape into the cytosol is required for autophagic recognition and targeting of these mutants.

Moreover, induction of autophagy via amino acid starvation ( Fig. S5B ) did not enhance autophagic capture of the O-antigen mutants (Fig. S5C ).

A correlate to this increased fragility is that such mutants may die in the cytosol and be subsequently cleared by autophagy, as we previously demonstrated in the case of a Schu S4 \u0394dipA mutant (Chong et al., 2012) , in addition to triggering activation of the AIM2 inflammasome. To examine whether the survival defect displayed by Schu S4 \u0394FTT1236 and \u0394manC mutants ( Fig. 2C -D) is due to either a lack of intrinsic viability and/or to autophagic killing, we first assessed the physical integrity of the \u0394FTT1236 and \u0394manC mutants compared to the wild type strain in both the infection inocula and in BMMs following phagosomal escape (90 min postinfection), using the membrane-impermeant dye propidium iodide (PI), either applied to the bacterial suspension or delivered to the host cell cytosol using digitonin permeabilization of infected cells (Chong et al., 2012) . Since these measurements were performed using two different methodologies, ratios between wild type and mutant percentages of PI-positive bacteria (integrity index) were established to allow for meaningful comparison. In both inocula and cytosolic populations of bacteria, the \u0394FTT1236 (integrity index values of 0.33 \u00b1 0.12 and 0.27 \u00b1 0.05, respectively) and \u0394manC (integrity index values of 0.31 \u00b1 0.13 and 0.28 \u00b1 0.10, respectively) mutants displayed decreased physical integrity (Fig. 5) , indicating that a significant number of the O-antigen-deficient bacteria were non-viable. Notably, these ratios did not change between the inocula (Fig. 5A ) and the cytosolic population of bacteria (Fig 5B) , suggesting that the O-antigen mutants are not significantly more sensitive to the phagosomal environment than the wild type strain. Taken together, these results indicate that a fraction of the O-antigen mutants are non-viable, which may account for the survival defects observed in BMMs ( Fig. 2C and D) .",

Comparable numbers of the \u0394FTT1236 mutant were ubiquitinated in control Atg5 flox/flox (43.1 \u00b1 9.2%) and Atg5-deficient BMMs (58.3 \u00b1 11.4%) at 2 h post-infection (Fig. 6A) , and the percentage of ubiquitinated \u0394manC bacteria was slightly yet non-significantly increased in the Atg5 flox/flox -Lyz-Cre BMMs (51.9 \u00b1 11.2%) relative to control BMMs (33.9 \u00b1 2.7%) (Fig. 6A ). Yet, capture of both mutants within LC3positive structures was abolished in Atg5 flox/flox -Lyz-Cre BMMs (Fig. 6B) , consistent with Atg5 function in the autophagic cascade.

This recovery indicates that autophagy further restricts viability of the O-antigen mutants. Interestingly, the \u0394FTT1236 strain, which does not express residual LPS O-antigen unlike the \u0394manC strain ( Fig. 2A) , was killed more efficiently in wild type BMMs and exhibited greater CFU recovery in the autophagy-deficient cells than the \u0394manC mutant ( Fig. 6D-E) . This suggests that the residual LPS O-antigen expressed by the \u0394manC strain renders it less vulnerable to targeting by autophagy. For both strains, however, CFU enumeration did not show restoration of mutant intracellular growth to wild-type levels, and even showed decreased viability of the \u0394FTT1236 and \u0394manC mutants after 16 and 10 h post-infection, respectively (Fig. 6D-E) . A microsocopy-based analysis of single cells infected with the O-antigen-deficient strains revealed, however, that both mutants were capable of significant replication in Atg5 flox/flox -Lyz-Cre but not in Atg5 flox/flox BMMs ( Fig.  6F -G). Moreover, quantification of replication in these cells showed that deletion of Atg5 allowed a shift of the intracellular mutant populations towards replication, with a majority of intact infected Atg5 flox/flox -Lyz-Cre BMMs containing more than 20 bacteria at 16 h postinfection compared to control BMMs, which had 5 or fewer (Fig. 6G) . Hence, autophagy deficiency confirms that after phagosomal escape, some O-antigen mutants are intracellularly viable and reveals that they are capable of replication in the cytosol, demonstrating that autophagy acts as a bactericidal mechanism against the O-antigen mutants.",

When compared between control Atg5 flox/flox and autophagy-deficient Atg5 flox/flox -Lyz-Cre BMMs, cytotoxicity levels in infected BMMs after 16 hours were 2.8 and a 12.6-fold higher in autophagy-deficient than in control BMMs for the \u0394manC and \u0394FTT1236 mutants, respectively (Fig. 6H ) and likely caused a loss of infected cells and CFUs (Fig. 6D-E) . This indicates that restoration of intracellular growth of these mutants (Fig. 6F -G) promotes their cytotoxic effect via increased intracellular numbers (Fig. 6G-H) , a condition that can be otherwise mimicked by high MOIs (Fig. 2B ; (Lai et al., 2010 , Lindemann et al., 2011 ). This finding is also consistent with the previous demonstration that the cytotoxic effects of O-antigen mutants limit the capacity of these mutants to replicate in human macrophages (Lindemann et al., 2011) . Additionally, the increased cytoxicity of the O-antigen mutants in autophagy-deficient BMMs is not simply due to prolonged residence in the cytosol, as a purine auxotroph, replication-deficient \u0394purMCD Francisella strain does not induce cytotoxicity despite its extended presence in the macrophage cytoplasm (Maier et al., 2007; Chong et al., 2012) .",

An unbiased genetic screen revealed that a surface polysaccharide, the O-antigen, contributes to this phenotype early in infection, by protecting F. tularensis from autophagic detection once it reaches the cytosol. The F. tularensis O-antigen is a component of both its LPS and capsule (Apicella et al., 2010) , both of which have other known immune-evasion properties. Francisella LPS is anti-inflammatory (Hajjar et al., 2006) , largely due to its unique lipid A structure (Phillips et al., 2004 , Gunn et al., 2007 and both the LPS and capsule contribute to resistance against complement-mediated lysis (Sorokin et al., 1996 , Lindemann et al., 2011 . Consistent with its multiple roles in interactions with the host, the demonstration of the O-antigen's protective function against autophagy was complicated by the deleterious consequences of its absence on bacterial viability and resulting hypercytotoxicity. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that the viable population of cytosolic O-antigen-deficient bacteria is subjected to efficient autophagic detection and killing in macrophages. Our results further extend the innate immune evasion functions of the O-antigen by assigning it an intracellular protective role against antibacterial autophagy.",

Consistent with LPS and capsular O-antigens having the same molecular identity and sharing common biosynthetic pathways (Apicella et al., 2010) , we were unable to genetically uncouple their expression, as any mutant tested was deficient in expression of both forms. Unless it is associated to a unique molecular pattern, it would be surprising that the LPS O-antigen is solely protective against autophagy, given the ubiquitous existence of polysaccharidic O-antigens among Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, greater than 95% of Francisella lipid A lacks O-antigen (Wang et al., 2006) , suggesting that most of it on the bacterial surface is expressed as a component of capsular material. We therefore speculate that capsule is responsible for shielding Francisella from autophagic recognition, as supported by the absence of the capsule-like electron-translucent layer around O-antigen mutants that normally surrounds cytosolic Francisella (Fig. 3B, S2 ; (Clemens et al., 2012) ). In addition to the O-antigen component of the capsule, the Francisella genome encodes a conserved capBCA operon showing weak homology to the Bacillus anthracis poly-D-glutamic acid capsule locus (Larsson, et al., 2005) . In-frame deletion of various genes of the capBCA operon did not however result in autophagic targeting of F. tularensis (data not shown). These observations are consistent with our hypothesis that the O-antigen constituent of the capsule, but not putative poly-D-glutamic acid components, is necessary for autophagy avoidance.",

Unlike the O-antigen mutants in this study, \u0394dipA mutant replication is not restored in Atg5-deficient macrophages (Chong et al., 2012) , indicating that autophagy does not limit their growth, but that they die prior to targeting. It is possible that as the \u0394dipA mutant dies in the cytosol, it eventually sheds its previously intact O-antigen or capsule (Fig. S1C) and exposes or releases molecules that can trigger the autophagic cascade. Similarly, the fraction of wild type Francisella that translocates into autophagic vacuoles (FCVs) late in their cycle within murine macrophages (Checroun et al., 2006) may also alter the composition of its surface, thereby permitting autophagic capture. In this context, the intrinsic lack of surface O-antigen on the \u0394FTT1236 and \u0394manC mutants explains their immediate detection and autophagic capture, compared to the protracted detection of a \u0394dipA mutant (Chong et al., 2012 ).

Indeed, various F. novicida hypercytotoxic mutants, including a \u0394fopA strain, display increased intracellular bacteriolysis, resulting in activation of the AIM2 inflammasome in response to the release of bacterial DNA ). Yet, a \u0394fopA mutant in F. tularensis exhibits the same intracellular fate as a \u0394dipA mutant (Chong et al., 2012) , indicating that it is not subject to early autophagic capture despite its compromised integrity. If early autophagic capture was a response to cytosolic release of bacterial molecules, our screen would also have identified mutants with defects unrelated to O-antigen. Yet, only O-antigen mutants were identified, which strongly argues that rapid autophagic capture of Francisella results from the lack of this surface molecule and not generic compromised bacterial integrity.",

Uptake of O-antigen mutants could also induce alternative intracellular signaling that contribute to autophagic capture. In support of differential signaling following phagocytosis of these mutants, infection with a F. novicida \u0394lpcC O-antigen mutant, whose LPS defects are similar to that of a \u0394manC mutant (Lai, et al., 2010) , up-regulates phosphorylation of the kinase Erk2 and the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) compared to wild-type bacteria (Nakayau, et al., 2013) . Regardless of the yet-to-bedefined molecular cascade leading to autophagic recognition of Francisella O-antigen mutants, our data supports the concept that expression of the O-antigen is required to prevent autophagic recognition and capture of cytosolic Francisella.",

While these findings may appear contradictory to our results, they are nonetheless consistent with the protective role of the surface O-antigen against selective recognition and capture of Francisella.

In the case of Shigella, the Type III secretion effector IscB competes with host ATG5 for binding to surface-exposed VirG, thereby interfering with the autophagic cascade (Ogawa et al., 2005) . Listeria coats its surface with host proteins via the actin-based motility protein ActA (Yoshikawa et al., 2009) and InlK (Dortet et al., 2011) , thereby disguising itself as a host organelle. We propose that once Francisella escapes the phagosome, the thick capsular Oantigen prevents exposure of surface molecules to the host cytosol that would otherwise be recognized by innate immune sensors, targeting the bacteria for autophagic elimination. Recently, LRSAM1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase with bacteria-binding properties was shown to initiate recruitment of early components of the autophagic cascade on cytosolic Salmonella (Huett et al., 2012) . Future studies will take advantage of the efficient targeting of Francisella O-antigen mutants to identify the bacterial surface molecules recognized and the autophagic sensors involved in antibacterial autophagy.",

Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMULV)derived retroviral particles containing the v-myc MC29 oncogene were produced using the Ecotropic Phoenix packaging system and pBMNZ-v-myc MC29 , a pBMN-Z derivative carrying a v-myc MC29 encoding fragment derived from p\u0394RM (Overell et al., 1988) kindly provided by Drs Jacques Peschon and Ed Miao, and Fugene 6 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Bone marrow cells were harvested and cultured for 2 days as described above and replated at a density of 1.2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well in a 6-well plate. After 6 h, cells were transduced by spinfection (1,800 \u00d7 g for 2 h at room temperature) with 0.45 \u03bcm-filtered retroviral supernatants supplemented with 4 \u03bcg/ml polybrene (Sigma), and allowed to recover at 37\u00b0C with 7% CO 2 for 1 h before the retroviral supernatants were replaced with fresh BMM medium. Immortalized BMMs (iBMMs) were expanded and CD11b +/ CD14 + cells were positively selected using rat anti-mouse CD11b (AbD Serotec) and rat anti-mouse CD14 (clone 159010; R&D Systems) antibodies and a Dynabeads \u2122 Sheep anti-rat IgG kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. iBMMs were then transduced with GFP-LC3-encoding retroviral particles generated using pJC110 and 293T cells as previously described (Checroun et al., 2006) . GFP-LC3expressing iBMMs were selected and expanded under G418 (Life Technologies; 200 \u03bcg/ml) selection for 7-10 days.",
