Outside cells, they exist as independent particles (i.e. virions) generally composed of a protein shell (sometimes covered with a lipid bilayer) that contains their genetic material made of RNA or DNA. Virus genome replication and transcription are catalyzed by virally encoded polymerases. Although all these enzymes show some homology and share structural features and their catalytic mechanism, they also have important differences that reflect diverse virus replication strategies.",

These viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) that share with eukaryotic DNA polymerases the characteristic fingers-palm-thumb subdomain arrangement. However, they show unique extensive interactions between the fingers and thumb subdomains that contribute to the formation of a well-defined template channel (Peersen, 2017; Lu and Gong, 2017) . The poliovirus polymerase is the smallest viral polymerase and recent studies have been focused on how to modulate its fidelity of RNA synthesis, as a potential strategy to use in the development of attenuated vaccines (Peersen, 2017) . Norovirus polymerases share a very similar structure, and it has received attention as a target of drugs currently in development. In their review, Deval et al. (2017) discuss on nucleoside analogues (e.g. ribavirin, favipiravir, 2 -C-methyl-cytidine) and nonnucleoside RdRp inhibitors (e.g. suramin) active in vitro against the human norovirus polymerase.",

Favipiravir is a novel nucleoside analogue in clinical trials developed against influenza that is also active against other viral RNA polymerases (see review by Deval et al., 2017) .

The polymerases of double-stranded RNA viruses (dsRNA) are represented by P2, the RdRp of the Pseudomonas phage 6 (Alphonse and Ghose, 2017). Cystoviruses such as 6 have segmented genomes and their virions contain the polymerase P2. This is because the genomic dsRNA cannot be used as mRNA for transcription and translation by host polymerases. The 6 polymerase shows significant homology with poliovirus and hepatitis C virus RdRps. Its crystal structure has been determined but a high-resolution elongation complex is not available. Studies on its conformational dynamics using optical tweezers are covered in this review, aimed at a better understanding of how nucleotide selectivity is controlled during RNA elongation.",
