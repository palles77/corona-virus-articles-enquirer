Adjustment for the onset time of a primary case led to little change in the results. In addition, in Hebei Province, a major affected area in China, only DAWV (OR \u00bc 0.38, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.72) was a significant predictor of secondary attack rate with adjustment for the onset time of primary case. In Inner Mongolia, another major affected area in China, DAWV (OR \u00bc 0.50, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.94) and DHS (OR \u00bc 0.27, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.81) were significant predictors of secondary attack rate with adjustment for the onset time of primary case. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with DAWV, and that DAAP, DARH and DHS may also have influenced the SARS outbreak to some extent. However, because of ecological fallacy and uncontrolled confounding effects that may have biased the results, the association between the SARS outbreak and these meteorological factors and air pollution deserve further investigation.",

Study design: An ecological study was conducted. Methods: Three hundred and fifty primary probable SARS cases diagnosed in mainland China between 1 January and 31 May 2003, and their 6727 close contacts during the period of their clinical symptoms before admission, were included in this study. Of the 6727 close contacts, 135 (2.0%) later developed clinical symptoms and were diagnosed as probable SARS cases. The daily meteorological data and daily air pollution data during the same SARS outbreak period in mainland China were used in the data analysis. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between the secondary attack rate of SARS and meteorological factors and air pollution. Results: In univariate analyses, daily average temperature (DAT), daily average air pressure (DAAP), and daily average relative humidity (DARH) were inversely associated with secondary attack rate (Po0.001); a significant positive association was found for daily hours of sunshine (DHS) (Po0.001). In multivariate analyses, factors associated with secondary attack rate were DAAP (odds ratio ( ",

As most established respiratory pathogens of human beings such as human coronavirus 229E and OC43 recur in wintertime, 1, 2 it is an important public health issue whether SARS, which is a respiratory infectious disease caused by SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), will follow the pattern of other respiratory viruses and reappear sometime. Furthermore, reports of four confirmed SARS cases in China's Guangdong Province in the winter of 2003-2004 prompted widespread speculation that SARS was making a seasonal resurgence. 1, 3 The potential sources of SARS resurgence include the natural animal reservoir, laboratory spillage, and an undetected low level of human infection. 4 Since some SARS cases shed detectable SARS-CoV RNA in their stools for at least nine weeks following recovery, 5 and the source or sources of the 2004 SARS viruses have not been definitively established, 1 recurrence of SARS from persistently shedding human or animal reservoirs is biologically plausible. If SARS behaves like newly emergent zoonotic diseases such as ebola or pandemic strains of influenza, it may be difficult to predict when, or if, it will re-emerge. 1 Therefore, an enhanced understanding of the determinants of the SARS outbreak, which will help public health officials to make better public health decisions to control a future outbreak, still assumes great importance.",

In 2003, the SARS outbreaks in Vietnam and Guangzhou were brought under control earlier than in Hong Kong. The argument that Vietnam and Guangzhou controlled the outbreaks by better medical facilities and hygienic standards is unconvincing. 6 Anecdotal reports suggest that changes in temperature may have been a contributing factor. The wider use of heaters in Toronto and air conditioning in Hong Kong and Singapore, usually to keep the room temperature within 18-22 1C, may have contributed to the long-lasting outbreak in these developed cities. 6 There have been some studies reporting an association between the SARS outbreak and meteorological factors and air pollution. 3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] However, these studies have largely been inconclusive. In fact, they use public data on SARS morbidity to obtain the daily reported number of probable SARS cases instead of the true daily onset number. Apparently, the results they obtained from the public data were doubtful due to time-delays and chaos in case reporting. In addition, as the designs in these studies focused on the relationship between the absolute daily number of SARS cases and meteorological factors, the results were greatly biased by the size of population in the affected areas. Therefore, no acceptable results up to now have been obtained concerning the association between the SARS outbreak and meteorological factors and air pollution.",

The histories of close contacts were confirmed by telephone interviews. All interviews were taperecorded and checked by quality control staff to monitor the quality of the interview data. Of the 365 primary probable SARS cases, 15 cases (4.1%) were excluded from the present study due to unreliable information, and 350 cases (95.9%) and their 6727 close contacts during the periods of their clinical symptoms before admission were included.

On average, droplets are about 3 microns in diameter and, when inhaled, are capable of bypassing the protective mechanisms of the upper respiratory tract, causing infection. Droplets of 3 microns in size can stay in the air for 3 h. 20 Wind is an important environmental parameter with respect to the suspending time of droplets in the air. In the outdoor environment, high wind velocity facilitates dilution and removal of the droplets and shortens their suspending time in the air, thus reducing the transmission potential. In the indoor environment, higher wind velocity usually means better ventilation for the same room. During the Toronto outbreaks of SARS, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in air samples that were obtained from the room occupied by a patient with SARS. 21 The viral load of the room air could be affected by ventilation. When ventilation was good, the number of infected people became smaller, and the infection rate became lower. 22 Our results are consistent with these findings. In this study, we found that higher DAWV corresponded to a lower secondary attack rate before admission of the primary case.

The results indicate that lower DARH corresponds to a higher secondary attack rate, which is consistent with our speculation. In addition, a high relative humidity level may shorten the suspending time of SARS-CoV in the air, as well as high wind velocity.

There have been studies reporting that SARS-CoV is sensitive to temperature and relatively stable at low temperatures. 14-16 However, some experimental evidence has shown that SARS-CoV remains stable at 4 1C, at room temperature (20 1C) and at 37 1C for at least 2 h without remarkable change in the infectious ability of cells, but is converted to a non-infectious state after 90-, 60-, and 30-min exposure at 56 1C, at 67 1C, and at 75 1C, respectively. 25 Therefore, air temperature may not have affected SARS-CoV transmission. The results of this study show that there is no relationship between DAT and secondary attack rate. This finding is confirmed by the experimental study, 25, 26 but is not consistent with other reports. 3, 27 Further investigations are necessary to verify this finding.",

Firstly, the present study used an ecological study design and may therefore produce ecological fallacy. In addition, it is impossible for us to make an estimate of the direction and magnitude of possible bias because of a lack of more detailed data. Secondly, the results of this study may have been influenced by some social factors and other natural factors. Although we used secondary attack rate before admission of the primary case as a dependent variable to minimize the influence of social factors on the results, a confounding bias of the present study is possible due to a lack of data on the joint distribution between other potential confounding factors and the meteorological factors studied. Finally, we used data from 673 meteorological observation stations in this study in an attempt to best reflect the exposure level of the study areas. In the process of making use of these data, we assumed that the exposures of each affected area and the corresponding observation station were homogenous, which may lead to exposure misclassification to some extent.",
