Here, we show that double stranded short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules corresponding to aMPV phosphoprotein (P) gene silence P RNA and protein expression. These siRNAs broadly reduced the expression of other viral proteins in addition to P, but did not have a discernable effect on cellular protein expression. The exposure of cells to P-specific siRNAs also led to inhibition of virus replication as evidenced by marked reduction in the progeny virion titers. Taken together, the findings suggest that exogenous P silencing siRNAs can inhibit aMPV replication with potential implications in the design of novel siRNA based prophylactics.",

The viral genome encodes at least nine proteins: nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), matrix (M2-1 and M2-2), small hydrophobic (SH), attachment glycoprotein (G) and large (L) RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) (Easton et al., 2004) . The functional polymerase complex is composed of L, P and N proteins, which are all required for transcription and replication (Barik, 2004; Dupuy et al., 1999; Easton et al., 2004) . The RdRP holoenzyme L is a major component of the polymerase complex and binds to the promoter/leader sequence at the 3 -end of the genomic RNA. However, L protein is unable to initiate transcription or replication in the absence of P protein, which serves as an elongation factor for L and facilitates promoter clearance (Dupuy et al., 1999) . Keeping in view the significance of P protein in viral transcription and replication, we investigated whether siRNAs targeting aMPV P protein transcripts are able to silence aMPV protein expression and impact replication. We here report the identification of siRNA target regions on aMPV P gene transcript that are able to silence P protein expression and inhibit replication of aMPV type C.",

Cell lysates prepared in 1\u00d7 sample buffer were separated by electrophoresis on 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For the detection of aMPV and host cell specific proteins, blots were probed with 1:1500 dilution of rabbit anti-aMPV polyclonal serum (gift from Kakambi V. Nagaraja, Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota) and anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) monoclonal antibody (Ambion, Austin, TX), respectively, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (KPL) and anti-mouse HRP conjugate (KPL), respectively. Blots were developed with LumiGLO chemiluminiscence substrate (KPL) and exposed to light X-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Developed blots were scanned by BioChemi System (UVP Bioimaging Systems, Upland, CA) and the relative intensity of P protein bands was determined after normalization against GAPDH expression. Except L, G, F and M2-2 proteins that have predicted M(r) of 229, 58.7, 58 and 8.2 kDa, respectively, the rest of aMPV proteins including P were detected on the blot (Fig. 1c) . The aMPV P protein is comprised of 294 amino acids and has a predicted M(r) of 32.4 kDa correlating well with the size of P protein observed on the blot. The P protein percent reduction was determined by densitometric scanning of two immunoblots and calculation of the mean relative P expression value. The P protein percent reduction among treatment groups was statistically compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test and p-values of less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Reduction of P protein was 94% (p < 0.001) and 91% (p < 0.001) complete by siP1 and siP3, respectively (Fig. 1d) , and was statistically significant as compared to the control siRNA. It is noteworthy that the expression of a non-targeted host protein, GAPDH, remained unaffected by all siRNA duplexes (Fig. 1c) suggesting that siRNAs induce sequence specific degradation of homologous RNA. In addition to P silencing, siP1 and siP3 transfected cells showed reduction in the amount of other viral proteins as well. Consistent with the immunofluorescence and FACS data, siP2 and siP4 induced a weaker inhibition of P and other aMPV proteins. Although, siP2 and siP4 induced only 46 and 25% inhibition of P protein, respectively, the reduction was statistically significant as compared to the control siRNA with p < 0.001 and <0.01, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1c , control siRNA did not alter the expression of P or other aMPV proteins and had protein profile comparable to cells not treated with siRNA (Fig. 1c) .",

Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to aMPV genomic RNA (GenBank accession number AY590688) leader sequence (forward primer 5 GCATATAAGACAACTTCCAA-AC) and nucleocapsid gene (reverse primer: 5 GCCCTTCC-CAAGAGAGTATGTC) were also used in real-time RT-PCR assays to determine siRNA induced reduction in the accumulation of viral genomic RNA. All reactions were run in triplicate on an ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). siRNAs induced seven-and eight-fold (siP1), 4.5and 3.7-fold (siP3) reduction in P gene transcripts at 24 and 58 h p.i., respectively, as compared with control siRNA (Fig. 2a) .

Values shown in the graph are the means \u00b1 standard deviations. also revealed a relatively weak silencing effect of siP2 and siP4 with siP2 inducing 2.5-and 2-fold and siP4 resulting in 2-and 1.8-fold reduction in P RNA levels at 24 and 58 h p.i., respectively. The P transcript profile in control siRNA treated cells was similar to those not treated with siRNA suggesting that control siRNA did not trigger non-specific degradation of P gene transcripts. aMPV genomic RNA targeted real-time RT-PCR also showed a reduction in genomic RNA accumulation by 3.4-and 2.1-fold in siP1 and siP3 treated cells, respectively (Fig. 2b) . Thus the determination of relative P transcript and genomic RNA levels suggested that the suppression of P protein expression observed on immunoblotting was indeed due to reduced stability and degradation of P gene mRNA and reduction in genomic RNA accumulation.",

Supernatants were collected from infected cultures at 36 and 58 h p.i. and virus titration was performed in two independent experiments by plaque assay as described (O'Mahony et al., 2000) . Briefly, Vero cells in six-well tissue culture plates were inoculated with 100 l of serially diluted virus in duplicates, allowed to adsorb for 1 h, and overlaid with 3 ml agar (1:1 ratio of 1.5% Tragacanth gum and 2\u00d7 MEM complete growth medium). After 6 days, gum overlay was removed, cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 2 min and plaque counts were determined. Percent plaque reduction by various siRNA molecules was statistically compared with the control siRNA treated cells by one-way ANOVA using Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test and p-values of less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. As shown in Fig. 2c , the P siRNAs were able to effectively inhibit the production of progeny virions. In agreement with their ability to silence P protein expression, siP1 and siP3 were found to be the strongest inhibitors of virus propagation and reduced the infectious viral titers by 88% (p < 0.001) and 86% (p < 0.001), respectively, at 36 h and by 75% (p < 0.01) and 76% (p < 0.01), respectively, at 58 h p.i. Likewise, in concordance with the P protein silencing profile, siP2 was relatively less effective and induced up to 50% (p < 0.001) and 21% (p > 0.05) reduction in virus plaque formation at 36 and 58 h p.i., respectively, while siP4 had a minimal effect on aMPV replication (Fig. 2c) .

Along with L and N proteins, P protein is packaged in the assembled virions which together initiate transcription and replication during initial stages of infection. However, owing to the critical roles of P protein as RdRP complex subunit (Dupuy et al., 1999; Easton et al., 2004) , active synthesis of new P protein is crucial to efficient replication without which blockage of further transcription and genomic RNA replication is imminent. Furthermore, continuous production of new P protein is also required as it is packaged within new virions egressing from the cell. Hence, broad inhibition of viral proteins as well as reduced viral titers may be attributed to the RNAi induced reduction in the intracellular amount of P protein and the subsequent lack of P protein function.",

Although all four siRNAs had sequences homologous to the P ORF, there was marked difference in their efficacy to establish P silencing. Such variation has been extensively reported (Ge et al., 2003; Kapadia et al., 2003; Orba et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004) and is postulated to be due to: (i) secondary and tertiary RNA structure of the target site disabling recognition by siRNA (Elbashir et al., 2001) , (ii) limited accessibility of the siRNA target sequence due to bound proteins, such as at the 5 -and 3 -ends of the ORF and (iii) error prone nature of the RdRP generates escape variants during the course of virus replication that possess mutations in their genome as well as the mRNA coded thereof (Gitlin et al., 2002) . A single nucleotide mismatch is known to abolish siRNA silencing effect (Bitko and Barik, 2001; Chi et al., 2003; Elbashir et al., 2001; Gitlin et al., 2002; Jacque et al., 2002; Semizarov et al., 2003) and thus siRNAs corresponding to variable regions fail to induce silencing. Thus, it appears that when targeting viral genes for RNAi, it may often be necessary to select several sites and preferably conserved regions in the gene of interest to identify potent siRNA sequences strongly inhibiting virus replication.",

            "text": "RNAi mediated viral gene silencing and replication block offers great potential for novel nucleic acid based antiviral approaches, provided efficient means for in vivo siRNA delivery could be developed. RNAi can be induced in eukaryotic cells by siRNA duplexes that are synthesized by chemical methods, in vitro transcription (Yu et al., 2002; Zamore et al., 2000) or expressed in the form of a double stranded hairpin structure by a DNA (Sui et al., 2002) or viral (Barton and Medzhitov, 2002; Devroe and Silver, 2004; Rubinson et al., 2003) vectors. The approach of expressing hairpin siRNAs by viral vectors may be the most practical and cost-effective delivery vehicle for RNAi based nucleic acid immunization of farm animals. In addition to serving as a fascinating addition to the existing tools for the biotechnological advancement of molecular vaccines, it offers the exciting opportunity to develop virus resistant transgenic animals genomically encoding a set of siRNAs making them immune to a variety of economically significant diseases (Saksela, 2003) . Hence, the application of RNAi to generate phenotypic mutation of aMPV described here holds great potential for the development of novel RNAi based antiviral strategies.",
