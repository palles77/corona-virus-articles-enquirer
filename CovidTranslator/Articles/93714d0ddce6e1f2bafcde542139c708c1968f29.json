IFN induction is a property common to most I~NA viruses (25) , although the ease with which this can be demonstrated may depend on several factors, including host cell type and age, prior treatment with IFN (priming) and inducing virus strain (3) . The in \"vitro characteristics of IFN induction by MttV strains were of interest to us because this was an aspect of MHV biology that had not been thoroughly investigated. The three reports on the subject indicate that MHV-JHM does not induce IFN production in cultured neuronal cells (7, 26, 27) . It was also of interest to determine if there was a differential sensitivity to IFN among the prototype strains of MHV.",

Because of the difficulty associated with interpreting results of studies in which different host systems or routes of inoculation were used, we have done a systematic study of the in vitro capacities of several MHV strains to induce 1FN production in several host types. Our results strongly suggest that MHV strains are poor IFN inducers in otherwise untreated cells, regardless of the host cell used.
