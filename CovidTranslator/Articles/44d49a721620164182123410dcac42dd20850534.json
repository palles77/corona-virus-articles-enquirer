            "text": "Plasma Cell Disorders Paul Mellor In classical terms, a plasma cell is a terminally differentiated B lymphocyte, and a myeloma cell is its neoplastically transformed progeny. These are simplistic definitions, for plasma cell disorders (PCDs) are a complex group comprising a diverse spectrum of benign conditions to cancers known as myeloma-related disorders (MRDs). 1 Multiple myeloma (MM) is the primogenitor of the PCD. First reported in humans in 1844, it is a cancer that has become synonymous with skeletal involvement. 2 A multistep transformation model had been hypothesized for the development of myeloma in humans. The myeloma cell is believed to be derived from a somatically mutated and isotypeswitched, postgerminal center B cell corresponding to a long-lived plasma cell. 3 Intramedullary plasma cells develop karyotypic instability and form immortalized clone(s). As clone numbers increase, a premalignant bone marrow MRD becomes evident. As clonal cells evolve, there is morphological transition with concomitant cancerous myeloma features, the development of multiple myeloma and eventual extension of extramedullary metastases. 4 Historical diagnostic criteria applied in human patients emphasizing the centrality of bone involvement were widely adopted in the diagnosis of feline myeloma.",

(ii) focal problems attributable to the consequences of clonal plasma cell protein production (i.e., focal light chain amyloid or Ig deposition). (iii) systemic problems attributable to the consequences of plasma cell protein production (e.g., renal insufficiency, reciprocal humoral immunoparesis, coagulopathy, hyperviscosity, amyloidosis, or Ig deposition diseases). (iv) systemic problems attributable to damage arising from widespread local cellular infiltration of myeloma cells (e.g., hypercalcemia from widespread osteolysis).

If water intake and/or urine output are thought to be abnormal, then have renal function, calcium status, and urinalysis been assessed? If pallor is present, has any anemia been characterized? If bleeding has been reported, has coagulation been assessed? Could bone pain be a possibility in the patient, with or without imaging evidence of bone lesions?

            "text": "The key morphological features of a mature plasma cell (also known as a terminally differentiated plasma cell, Marschalko cell, or plasmacyte) are as follows: intensely basophilic cytoplasm due to the high ribonucleoprotein content, an acroplasm (or pale perinuclear \"hof \", a focal area of clearing) representing a prominent Golgi apparatus, an eccentric nuclear position, and \"cartwheel\" chromatin arrangement. Variations in plasma cell morphology have been clearly defined in humans. Plasmacytoid is a descriptor for (1) any nonspecific variation of mature plasma cell characteristics, and (2) plasma cell type appearance of cells of non-B cell origin. Lympho-plasmacytoid cells have a mixed lymphocyte and mature plasma cell appearance with typically less basophilic cytoplasm. Flame cells and/or thesaurocytes have red to violaceous coloration of the cytoplasm attributed to the accumulation of high carbohydrate content Ig within the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. 96 Mott cells contain multiple cytoplasmic Russell bodies (Ig inclusions). 97 Proplasmacytes are larger than mature plasma cells with greater anisocytosis, asynchronous nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, and indistinct or small nucleoli. 98 Plasmablasts are larger than mature plasma cells with greater anisocytosis, a narrow rim of cytoplasm, less distinct or inapparent perinuclear hof, high N : C ratio, a large and immature round to ovoid eccentric nucleus with anisokaryosis, and one or more prominent nucleoli. 98 Binucleate, trinucleate, and multinucleate giant myeloma cells may also be observed. 99 In the feline MRD literature, many histopathologic and cytopathologic reports of feline MRD simply describe the neoplasia as comprising of plasma cells. Other reports have provided greater detail and virtually all of the morphological descriptors used in human myeloma have been used in the cat including mature (Marschalko-type) plasma cells, 64 plasmacytoid, 14,25,39 lympho-plasmacytoid, 23,50,59 flame cells, 48 Russell bodies, 64 Mott cells, 53 proplasmacytes, 64 plasmablasts, 64 and giant multinucleated myeloma cells. 78, 94 Cytopathological and histopathological examples of these cells may be seen at the Veterinary Myeloma Website. 100",

            "text": "Taken in isolation, the examination of a single plasmacytoid cell or even groups of plasma cells does not allow the cytopathologist or histopathologist to define that these cells are myeloma cells (that is to say, neoplastically transformed). electrophoretic tests have improved (e.g., capillary zone electrophoresis). Furthermore, a combination of tests are used to increase the diagnostic accuracy for PCD. 87 Serum protein electrophoresis will detect monoclonal levels as low as 500 mg/L, immunofixation as low as 150 mg/L, but the latest nephelometric immunoassays for serum immunoglobulin free light chains (SFLC) are capable of detecting less than 1 mg/L. Quantification of SFLC is now recommended in all human MRD patients for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring. 88 Note that even where standard electrophoresis methodologies do detect a quantitative abnormality, they cannot always reliably identify a monoclonal protein and differentiate it from, for example, a restricted oligoclonal gammopathy. Therefore, immunofixation electrophoresis is used as the confirmatory gold standard test for the presence of a monoclonal protein and to distinguish its heavy and light chain type. A 24-hour urine collection for urine protein electrophoresis, protein quantification, and immunofixation are additional tests frequently used in the investigation of monoclonal gammopathies in humans. 89 Although most cases of hyperglobulinemia can be commonly assigned to either a poly-or a monoclonal gammopathy, it is not universally dichotomous. Human patients with biclonal and triclonal gammopathies have been described, most with a confirmed lymphoproliferative neoplasm, but some were of undetermined significance, and others had nonhematological diseases. 90, 91 In the cat, cases of hyperglobulinemia are typically further assessed by standard agarose gel electrophoresis. Use of capillary zone electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis (but not immunofixation) have recently been described in feline MRD. 18, 21 Most cases of feline hyperglobulinemia have a polyclonal gammopathy. The underlying cause of a polyclonal gammopathy is a diverse range of disorders with a reactive or inflammatory plasma cell component. 93 Monoclonal gammopathies in cats are most commonly associated MRD and/or lymphoma. 1, 19, 26, 36, 48 Monoclonal gammopathies have been reported in rare cases of FIP, lymphocytic-plasmacytic stomatitis, and anaplasmosis. 19, 40, [92] [93] [94] However, the stringency of diagnosis in these latter reports is relatively uncertain (where described, it is based on histopathology or hematopathology only and no further confirmatory tests). Furthermore, there is a possibility of ascertainment bias and coincidental association. 95 Note that biclonal paraproteinemias have been reported in feline MRD. 1, 12, 38 The evolved complexity, precision of analysis, and interpretation of gammopathies seen in human patients have not been available in the cat. Some reports in the feline literature of monoclonal and biclonal gammopathies in association with MRD may be incorrect in the absence of immunofixation electrophoresis and confirmation of a clonal MRD within the tissue of interest. Furthermore, there are four cases reported in the feline literature to have MRD on the basis of routine histopathology, with no demonstration of tissue clonality but instead having a polyclonal gammopathy. 26,58,62 They Progressive morphologic changes within plasma cells (with ultimately the development of plasmablastic features) have clearly been correlated with accumulating cytogenetic aberrations and progressive clinical disease. 101 ,102 Yet these morphologic changes do not take place uniformly. Diverse populations of plasma cell morphology may be seen within a single biopsy. Therefore, a provisional diagnosis of a MRD is achieved through synthesis of multiple observations including lesional and perilesional tissue and cellular changes, density of plasma cells, as well as the above plasma cell morphological features and the relative proportions between these cells. In soft tissues, the presence of mass-related changes allows greater confidence in the provisional diagnosis. Within bone marrow, although near complete effacement of the marrow cavity by plasma cells is occasionally observed, it is more common to see varying degrees of plasma cell density and a cut off of 10% or greater infiltration is required for diagnosis. 103 The demonstration of monoclonality in the tissue of interest remains the gold standard for the pathological component of diagnosis of this hematopoietic neoplasia (e.g., patients can have concurrent MGUS and an unrelated round cell tumor misinterpreted as a MRD). The demonstration of polyclonality within the tissue of interest implies a reactive or inflammatory plasma cell population. Clonality may be investigated via a number of techniques. Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry allow the surrogate demonstration of clonality when expression of a single Ig light chain only is revealed, and this is the most common technique in veterinary medicine. Alternative techniques include flow cytometry, molecular biological tests such as polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot, and an array of cytogenetic and epigenetic tests. 89, [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] In practical terms, the confirmed presence of IA can also be used as a surrogate marker of clonality, but there should be an awareness that in rare patients there may be discordant results. 109, 110 In some of the published feline MRD series, there have been arguably insufficiently stringent inclusion criteria, with some individual patients diagnosed with MRD on the basis of histopathology alone, with no serum or urine protein electrophoresis carried out, and no other assessment of clonality. 26, 36, 48 In the practice of veterinary medicine, there is often a pragmatic clinical supposition of a MRD if routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained pathology or cytopathology provide a morphological diagnosis consistent with a MRD and this is combined with an indirect indication of clonality (i.e., the detection of a monoclonal protein in serum or urine). However, the importance of clonal confirmation in the tissue of interest in cases of feline MRD has been reported. In one study, 34 histopathological samples with an original diagnosis of MRD made by a diversity of board-certified pathologists in various institutions and laboratories were subjected to review by an independent panel of boardcertified pathologists who examined H&E stained sections along with additional histochemical and immunohistochemical stained sections. Only 56% (n = 19) of the cases were eventually shown to be clonal MRD by light chain restriction. 64 Some of the excluded feline cases were not of B cell origin despite a plasmacytoid appearance (instead proving to be histiocytic neoplasms or mast cell tumors). Cellular morphology is linked to function, and other non-B lymphoid cells that have high demand for protein production (e.g., not Ig) may have a plasmacytoid appearance. Further examples include plasmacytoid dendritic cells, histiocytes, salivary gland duct luminal cells, and myoepithelial cells. [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] ",

Tumor grading has prognostic significance. 115, 116 There is generally good agreement between cytologic and histologic categorization of tumors. 64, 98 Only two case series with clonally confirmed MRD have presented tumor morphologic classification systems in the cat. 41, 64 In the largest case series of feline MRD thus far, tumors were classified as well-differentiated (less than 15% plasmablasts, with the remainder being mature myeloma cells, proplasmacytes, or lymphocytes), intermediate-grade (15% to 49% plasmablasts), or poorly differentiated (greater than 50% plasmablasts). A correlation between morphology and survival was proved with statistical significance.

This occurs through both the direct cellular toxic effect of amyloid precursors, as well as damage to organ structure and function via massive deposition of amyloid fibrils in extracellular spaces. Biopsies must show amyloid deposition confirmed by Congo-red staining and apple-green birefringence under polarizing light microscopy. The amyloid must then be typed, which historically has been achieved through histochemical assessment or immunohistochemistry, although more recently it has been supplanted by laser microdissection with mass spectrometry (LMD/MS). 117 Typing allows precise categorization of the amyloid. Numerous amyloidogenic proteins have been discovered, but only a single group is relevant to the MRD-the IA. 118 Historically, IA diseases have largely been considered separately from MRD. Even in recent times, IA is described by some authors as a nonproliferative and nonneoplastic PCD. 119 However, current work confirms shared aspects of pathogenesis in terms of the where this is relevant it is highlighted later.

However, the validity of this report is questionable with no proof or disproof of clonality within the tissue biopsy, and no exclusion of intercurrent MRD in alternate locations. 93 In the second case, a cat with pododermatitis was reported to have subsequently developed systemic amyloidosis. There was no typing of the amyloidosis (to confirm Ig origin) and no exclusion of intercurrent MRD in alternate locations. 123 Plasma cell granulomas (more commonly known as inflammatory pseudotumor in the cat or inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor) contain polyclonal plasma cells but are clinically and pathologically readily distinguishable from other PCDs and MRDs. 132, 133 ",

However, despite the fact that most MGUS patients do not within their lifespan develop overt symptoms of myeloma, most or all are expected to have a clonal plasma cell disorder. In cytogenetic studies alone, plasma cell clone(s) have been demonstrated in 77% of human patients with MGUS. 135 All human myeloma patients are believed to progress from MGUS, through smoldering myeloma (asymptomatic myeloma), and to myeloma (see Table 55 -2 for diagnostic criteria).",

There is evidence that extramedullary tissue may be a more common primary site of myeloma cell development than the intramedullary compartment in the cat. 1, 64 There have been pathological reports of cutaneous masses in feline MRD, 14,39,41 but relatively few with accompanying comprehensive clinical investigations that allow a diagnosis of cutaneous extramedullary plasmacytoma (CEMP-see Table 55 -2). Some feline CEMPs have been apparently solitary masses, not associated with systemic signs or hyperglobulinemia and where surgical excision resulted in prolonged survival. 1 This is similar to the biologic behavior typically shown in other species, where CEMPs are usually nonsecretory, have a benign course, and surgical excision is curative. 79, 140 Rarely, CEMPs show a malignant course with progression to myeloma in either humans or the dog. 79, 141 By contrast, a number of feline MRD reports exist where cats with cutaneous plasma cell neoplasms exhibited systemic signs, had a demonstrable monoclonal protein, were affected by multi-organ plasma cell infiltration, and experienced rapid tumor development. 1, 15, 19, 27, 49 Noncutaneous extramedullary plasmacytoma (NCEMP) appears to be common in the cat, comprising 50% of those MRD cases that had both bone marrow and abdominal organ sampling carried out in one series. 1 Occasional feline NCEMP reports have described isolated tumors showing localized signs, without evidence for systemic involvement or hyperglobulinemia (e.g., within the uveal tract or sinonasal cavities). 35, 45, 53 However, the majority of feline NCEMP feline cases have had signs of systemic illness, an accompanying monoclonal protein, and later metastatic or multisite development. 1, 27, 42, 48, 56, 61 Typically, the liver and/or spleen were infiltrated. Other locations have included the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, stomach, epidura, orbit, and retroperitoneal space. In the largest clinical series of confirmed feline MRD, the hypothesis that cats with MRD commonly present with extramedullary involvement in contrast to human patients with MRD was demonstrated (67% versus 5% respectively, p < 0.001). 1",

However, there has been some confusion in earlier literature regarding the diagnostic criteria of MM in cats. For example, cats have been reported as having MM despite pathological evidence of the absence of bone marrow infiltration, and instead having extramedullary involvement. 36, 46 In general, across the feline literature, given the historical diagnostic criteria, there will likely have been a tendency to a reporting bias towards MM cases that involved radiographic bone lesions. Examining the literature prior to 2005, 75 cases of all types of MRD had been described, of which 36 provided clinical details of investigations (mainly in the form of case reports or small case series). Of these, 22 cases were explicitly described as MM, of which only 6 (27%) had radiographically evident bone lesions-a notably low proportion in comparison to humans-in whom 80% of MM cases have radiographically detectable osteolysis. 136 Then in 2005, two larger clinical case series of MM were published. In one series from a single institution, 58.3% of MM cases had radiographically evident bone lesions. 48 In another series from a single veterinary practice with an orthopedic bias, the proportion was 71.4%. 26 However, in 2006, in a multidepartmental, multicenter clinical case series, the authors proposed that feline MRD cases infrequently (8%) present with radiographic bone lesions, with some additional statistical support for this hypothesis. 1 The conclusions that can be drawn are limited by the retrospective nature of all of these studies, the failure to obtain complete skeletal survey radiographs in all cases, and the imperfect comparisons made. However, given the pre-existing literature and the authors' findings, it is probable that fewer feline MRD cases have classical radiographically detectable osteolysis compared to human patients.",

Indeed in humans, there are additional disorders involving plasma cell pathology and gammopathies that have yet to be described in the feline literature. In the past two decades, there has been a move to classify human patients into a new category: \"Symptomatic Multiple Myeloma.\" This new diagnosis accommodates patients with either intramedullary or extramedullary disease, or both (see Table 55 -2). Symptomatic multiple myeloma also accords significance to whether patients are displaying signs of myeloma-related end organ damage. There may be value in recategorizing MRDs in veterinary medicine, employing a system that potentially facilitates greater consistency in diagnostic investigation and classification. The proposed system retains a central role for pathological diagnosis, but with an altered, more patient-centric focus explicitly incorporating a broader range of myeloma-related clinical problems. A system that incorporates other lymphoproliferative disorders into MRD when they have protein-related functional disorders (e.g., lymphoma patients producing a monoclonal protein, or patients with IA or MIDD). Ultimately, this system is a combined diagnosis and risk stratification system. This last point in particular is of assistance when there are indistinct boundaries between traditional MRD diagnostic categories which may be observed in patients of any species. Patients may be asymptomatic with low cellular proliferation (benign monoclonal gammopathy at time of death), clinically affected with low cellular proliferation (immunoglobulin amyloidosis), or clinically affected with high cellular proliferation (multiple myeloma). Furthermore, clonal plasma cells can show widely varying biological behavior within the same patient over the course of a lifetime.",

Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is a rare MRD. Clinical evolution from SPB to MM is recognized, although a key feature of SBP patients is the slow natural time course of disease progression. As diagnostic testing methodology has advanced, the diagnostic criteria for SPB have changed. For example, many more SPB patients have been discovered with monoclonal proteins with the advent of more sensitive techniques for assessment. Patients thought to be affected with SPB have instead been reclassified as MM through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) discovery of additional bone lesions not apparent on standard skeletal radiographic survey. 145 Current diagnostic criteria for SBP are given in Table 55 -2. Two feline cases of SBP have been reported. 44 Both cats presented with single spinal lesions causing neurological signs. Both were treated, and prolonged remissions for several years were achieved with radiotherapy in one case and chemotherapy in the other.",

In veterinary medicine this will be a crude stratification estimate, but the system should prove adaptable to additional diagnostic and stratification criteria over time (e.g., \"APPPO\", where the inclusion of \"O\" for \"other\" allows consideration of independent prognostic features such as serum albumin, beta-2 microglobulin, cytogenetics, etc., as used in humans). 148 Case examples of the diagnostic approach are given in Table 55-4 .

Laboratory testing of total globulin, and/or quantification of serum, and/or urine monoclonal protein should be considered at 3-to 6-month intervals, or more frequently if there is suspicion of more rapidly progressing disease. New bone benefit for selected cats receiving surgery has been demonstrated when compared to cats that received no therapy or glucocorticoids alone. 1,64 A variety of surgical therapies including cutaneous mass excision, splenectomy, and enucleation have been reported across the feline literature, and generally positive responses have been documented in appropriately selected cases. For example, in a typical clinical decision-making process, a solitary plasmacytoma of the spleen might be suspected on the basis of a discovered serum/ urine monoclonal protein along with sonographic evidence for splenic structural changes, cytopathological indications of well differentiated plasma cells, and no radiographic evidence for bone lesions (based on a complete skeletal survey). Further testing could include additional splenic aspirates for immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangements as well as further imaging (e.g., MRI or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans and concurrent bone marrow aspirate and trephine). If there are no further involved sites identified, then splenectomy would follow. This paradigm follows the current best evidence in human patients-that truly localized EMP at accessible sites should be completely surgically excised. 79 However, in areas of poor surgical access (e.g., the upper respiratory or digestive tract), radiotherapy alone is the treatment of choice. 79 Solitary visceral organs that are diffusely infiltrated and cannot be safely excised or irradiated (e.g., hepatic plasmacytoma with diffuse hepatic infiltration) may be treated with chemotherapy as per other myeloma cases (see Multifocal Lesions).",
