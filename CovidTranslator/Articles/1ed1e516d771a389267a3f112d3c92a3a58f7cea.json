These contain all of the immunocompetent cells that are required for the generation of an immune response (that is, T cells, B cells and antigen-presenting cells). Peyer's patches, in the gut, and nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) -two of the main components of MALT -are important inductive tissues for the generation of mucosal immunity through the ingestion and inhalation of antigen in the intestinal and respiratory tracts respectively 1 (FIG. 1) . The COMMON MUCOSAL IMMUNE SYSTEM (CMIS) connects these inductive sites (that is, the Peyer's patches and NALT) with effector sites (such as the lamina propria of the intestinal and respiratory tracts, and glandular tissues) for the generation of antigen-specific T helper 2 (T H 2)-cell-dependent IgA responses, and T H 1-cell-and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-dependent immune responses, which function as the first line of defence at mucosal surfaces 1,2 . In this review, we discuss three issues concerning the biology of the NALT immune system: first, we focus on the unique characteristics of its tissue genesis compared with that of Peyer's patches; second, we examine the immunological function of NALT; and third, we discuss manipulation of the NALT immune system to develop mucosal vaccines.",

M cells deliver antigens by transepithelial vesicular transport from the aerodigestive lumen directly to the subepithelial lymphoid tissues of nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue and Peyer's patches. (FIG. 2) . In rats, the development of NALT is also observed postnatally as a small accumulation of lymphoid cells 7 . These findings indicate a prenatal initiation of lymphoid organogenesis for Peyer's patches and a postnatal initiation for NALT. An intriguing possibility is that the NALT-genesis programme is triggered after birth through stimulatory signals that are provided by environmental antigens and mitogens. This view is supported by the finding that nasal administration of cholera toxin, a well-known mucosal immunogen with adjuvant activity, resulted in the acceleration of NALT organogenesis and the development of the bell-shaped lymphoid tissue 5 . Therefore, environmental stimulation might be essential for NALT organogenesis, although shown to be associated with the tissue genesis of Peyer's patches, because a cluster of VCAM1 + stromal cells occurs at the site of Peyer's-patch development on day 15.5 after coitus 4 . To determine when NALT develops, we used immunohistochemistry to analyse PNAD expression in wild-type mice of various ages. NALT formation was not observed during embryogenesis or in newborn mice 5 (FIG. 2) , whereas Peyer's patches were already present in the embryo as domeshaped lymphoid tissues 6 . Instead, PNAD + HEVs with associated lymphocytes were first detected bilaterally in nasal tissue at 1 week after birth, and the complete formation of bell-shaped NALT (including lymphoid cells) was not observed until 5-8 weeks after birth 5 COMMON MUCOSAL IMMUNE SYSTEM (CMIS).

Luminal antigens are transported to the nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and Peyer's patches through microfold (M) cells that are present in the epithelium overlying NALT and Peyer's-patch follicles. Dendritic cells process and present antigens to T cells in these lymphoid tissues. CD4 + T cells that are stimulated by dendritic cells then preferentially induce IgA-committed B-cell development in the germinal centre of the lymphoid follicle. After IgA class switching and affinity maturation, B cells rapidly migrate from NALT and Peyer's patches to the regional cervical lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes respectively, through the efferent lymphatics. Finally, antigen-specific CD4 + T cells and IgA + B cells migrate to effector sites (such as the nasal passage and intestinal lamina propria) through the thoracic duct and blood circulation. IgA + B cells and plasmablasts then differentiate into IgA-producing plasma cells in the presence of cytokines (such as interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-6) that are produced by T helper 2 (T H 2) cells, and they subsequently produce dimeric (or polymeric) forms of IgA. These dimeric forms of IgA then become secretory IgA by binding to polymeric Ig receptors (which become the secretory component in the process of secretory IgA formation) that are displayed on the monolayer of epithelial cells lining the mucosa. Secretory IgA is then released into the nasal passage and intestinal tract. TCR, T-cell receptor.",

LTs are essential for secondary lymphoid-tissue organogenesis that is associated with the mucosal immune system, because deletion of either the genes that encode LT or the LT receptors, or artificial blockade of the interaction between the cytokine and its receptor during the embryonic period, results in the inhibition of both Peyer's-patch and peripheral lymphnode development 8, 10, 11 . For example, deletion of the Lt-\u03b1 gene prevented Peyer's-patch formation and greatly limited the number of lymph nodes that developed 8 . LT-\u03b1 forms LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 heterotrimers that can transduce an activation signal through the LT-\u03b2R, contributing to the organization of secondary lymphoid tissues 10 . When an LT-\u03b2R-Ig fusion protein was infused to antagonize the biological function of the LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 heterotrimer, lymphoid tissue formed at different anatomical locations depending on which embryonic stage was perturbed by introduction of the fusion protein 10 . This finding shows that the timing of secondary lymphoid-tissue development is regulated during embryogenesis 10, 12 . We also found that the infusion of LT-\u03b2R-Ig between embryonic day (E) 15 and E17 suppressed Peyer's-patch development but had no effect on the formation of lymph nodes 13 . These studies clearly indicate the importance of the programmed inflammation that is mediated by LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 and the LT-\u03b2R for the genesis of Peyer's patches (TABLE 1; FIG. 3), but it is also known that another membrane-bound member of the TNF family, LIGHT, can bind to the LT-\u03b2R 14 . However, lymph nodes and Peyer's patches develop in the absence of LIGHT 15 . These findings indicate that the LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 -LT-\u03b2R interaction is the essential component of programmed inflammation that initiates Peyer's-patch genesis at a particular time during the gestational period. An additional cytokine that is associated with the mucosal immune system, namely interleukin-7 (IL-7), also has a crucial role in the initiation of Peyer's-patch genesis. IL-7 is produced by both mouse and human intestinal epithelial cells 16, 17 , and it provides stimulation and growth signals for neighbouring intestinal intraepithelial \u03b3\u03b4 T CELLS 16, 18 . In mice that are deficient in the IL-7 receptor \u03b1-chain (Il-7r\u03b1 -/-), only the formation of Peyer's patches, and not lymph nodes, was impaired 19 . Similarly, when IL-7R\u03b1 function was blocked by administration of a single injection of an antagonistic monoclonal antibody to pregnant mothers on E15.5, the resulting offspring were deficient in Peyer's patches but showed normal lymph-node development 12 . These findings further emphasize that the LT-\u03b2R-and IL-7R-mediated tissue-genesis programme is crucial for the initiation of Peyer's-patch formation at the appropriate stage of embryogenesis (E14-E17) ( ",

The formation of NALT was studied in mice lacking Peyer's patches and/or lymph nodes, including Lt-\u03b1 -/-, Lt-\u03b2 -/and aly/aly mice, and mice that were treated in utero with the LT-\u03b2R-Ig fusion protein 5 (TABLE 1) . Nasal lymphoid tissue was detected in all mouse strains lacking Peyer's patches or both Peyer's patches and lymph nodes because of a deficiency in the LT-\u03b2R-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade 5 . A separate study by Harmsen and colleagues 31 confirmed the formation of NALT in the absence of LT-\u03b2R-mediated signalling. The authors also showed that NALT formation was reconstituted in mice that were deficient in both TNF and LT-\u03b1 by the adoptive transfer of wild-type bone marrow, even though Peyer's patches did not develop in these mice 31 . These findings further support the idea that NALT development does not conform with the model of programmed inflammation that is required for the genesis of Peyer's patches (FIG. 3) . Because Peyer's-patch formation has also been shown to require the IL-7R-mediated signalling pathway, in addition to the LT-\u03b2R cascade, NALT development was examined in IL-7R-deficient mice. NALT, but not Peyer's patches, was found to develop in IL-7Rdeficient mice 5, 31 . Taken together, these findings directly show that NALT formation is independent of IL-7R-and LT-\u03b2R-mediated tissue genesis (FIG. 3) .",

So, a high frequency of CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + cells is observed in the intestinal tract at embryonic stages of development (FIG. 2) . Furthermore, Id2 has been identified as one of IL-7R + CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + cells that are considered to be PEYER'S-PATCH INDUCERS express CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5) and can produce membrane-associated LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 heterotrimer, whereas mesenchymal-lineage VCAM1 + and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) + PEYER'S-PATCH ORGANIZERS express the LT-\u03b2R 20,21 (FIG. 3) . Following stimulatory signals that are provided through the IL-7R, Peyer's-patch inducers express LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 , which activates Peyer's-patch organizers through the LT-\u03b2R; and in turn, Peyer's-patch organizers produce chemokines, such as CXC-chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) and CC-chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19), which stimulate Peyer's-patch inducers through CXCR5 and CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) (REF. 22 ). The reciprocal interaction between inducer and organizer cells through chemokine and cytokine receptors is essential for the formation of Peyer's patches (FIG. 3) , and the loss of any component of either of the signalling programmes is sufficient to disrupt secondary lymphoid-tissue development, as indicated by the loss of Peyer's patches in LT-\u03b2R-deficient and IL-7R\u03b1-deficient mice 9, 23 . Furthermore, deletion of the gene that encodes CXCR5 partially reduces the formation and number of Peyer's patches 24 (TABLE 1) . The lack of Peyer's patches and lymph nodes in alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice, which have defective NIK (nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-inducing kinase) function, also fits this model, because recent analyses have established that NIK is essential for the transduction of signals through the TNFR family, including those through the LT-\u03b2R 25, 26 . So, aly/aly mice lack Peyer's patches because the NIK mutation inhibits the reciprocal interaction between Peyer's-patch inducers and organizers that is mediated through LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 and the LT-\u03b2R 27, 28 . Further evidence in support of this model comes from studies showing that mice that lack the CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + inducer cells, owing to genetic deletion of the transcriptional regulators ID2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) or ROR-\u03b3 (retinoic-acid-receptorrelated orphan receptor-\u03b3), also lack Peyer's patches and lymph nodes 29, 30 .",

Seven days after this transfer, CD3 -CD4 + cells were observed to have migrated to the site of NALT formation, and 7 weeks after transfer, a NALT-like structure was detected 5 . These findings are the first to show directly in vivo that CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + inducer cells are essential for the initiation of organogenesis of secondary lymphoid tissues (such as NALT).",

Because little is known about the induction of nasally induced tolerance, we focus here on the role of NALT in the induction of protective immunity. The germinal-centre region contains a high frequency of IgM + B220 + B cells that express activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which is essential for \u00b5-to \u03b1-gene conversion 48 . In an early study, it was shown that incubation of IgM + IgA -B cells isolated from Peyer's patches in the presence of the cytokine transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) resulted in the generation of IgM -IgA + B cells [49] [50] [51] . These post-switch IgA-committed B cells then migrated to mucosal effector tissues (such as the intestinal lamina propria), a process mediated by a group of homing and chemokine receptors and their ligands (such as MADCAM1-\u03b1 4 \u03b2 7 -integrin and CCL25-CCR9 interactions) 52,53 (discussed later). In the intestinal lamina propria, these cells became IgA + plasma cells in the presence of the IgA-enhancing cytokines IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 (REFS 50,54-58). So, it was generally accepted that organized lymphoid structures of MALT, such as Peyer's patches, function as the inductive sites for generating IgAcommitted B cells through \u00b5to \u03b1-gene CSR, whereas the diffuse tissues of the intestinal lamina propria function as effector sites for the production of IgA 1,2 (FIG. 1) .

Also, in a recent study, a NALT-like structure of lymphocyte aggregates that form follicles was identified in human nasal mucosa, particularly in the MIDDLE CONCHA of children less than two years of age 36 , indicating that an equivalent to mouse NALT can develop in humans. NALT consists of follicle-associated epithelium (FAE), HEVs, and T-cell-and B-cell-enriched areas. Antigen-sampling M cells are present in the epithelium of NALT, which is specialized for antigen uptake similar to the FAE of Peyer's patches 7, 37 . Antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, are also found in NALT 38 . So, NALT contains all of the lymphoid cells that are required for the induction and regulation of mucosal immune responses to antigens that are delivered to the nasal cavity. For example, the intranasal administration of reovirus resulted in the formation of germinal centres in NALT, leading to the clonal expansion of antigen-induced IgA + B cells and the subsequent generation of reovirus-specific IgA in the respiratory and intestinal tracts 39 . Moreover, reovirus-specific CTLs were also induced in NALT with a high frequency. These findings show that NALT can be a potent inductive site for the mucosal immune system. In addition to the induction of positive immune responses, the nasal deposition of antigen has been shown to be effective for the induction of systemic unresponsivenessa form of mucosally induced tolerance 40 We propose that both ROR-\u03b3 (retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-\u03b3) and ID2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) are essential for the generation of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R)expressing CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + cells for the induction of Peyer's-patch organogenesis. By contrast, the generation of the IL-7R -CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + inducer cells that are involved in nasopharynxassociated lymphoid tissue (NALT) organogenesis is regulated by ID2 but not ROR-\u03b3. However, this model remains to be tested experimentally, and other possibilities exist (see main text). NALT genesis in ID2-deficient mice can be initiated by the adoptive transfer of CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + cells from wild-type mice, but the maturation of NALT formation is incomplete. This indicates that other cell populations, or the endogenous expression of ID2 at the site of NALT, might be required for the full maturation of NALT.",

This finding was confirmed by the molecular analysis of IgA CSR-associated mRNA specific for AID, I\u03b1-C\u00b5 CIRCULAR TRANSCRIPTS and I\u00b5-C\u03b1 TRANSCRIPTS. Because the expression of AID and the I\u03b1-C\u00b5 circular transcript are upregulated preferentially during \u00b5to \u03b1-gene conversion and then quickly downregulated, these molecular events are considered to be a hallmark of B cells that are undergoing IgA class switching 69 . The expression of I\u00b5-C\u03b1 transcripts indicates the completion of IgA-specific CSR 59 . This analysis showed that the expression of AID-, I\u03b1-C\u00b5 circular transcriptand I\u00b5-C\u03b1 transcript-specific mRNA was restricted to the organized mucosal inductive tissues of NALT and Peyer's patches but was not found in the diffuse effector tissues of the nasal passage and intestinal lamina propria 68 . Furthermore, these organized mucosal lymphoid tissues are known to be associated with B2 cells 66 . So, these findings indicate that the IgA class switching, at least for B2 cells, requires the organized lymphoid structures of NALT and Peyer's patches in the aero-digestive tract. NALT was also recently shown to be an important site for the generation of memory B cells, which produce high-affinity IgA 70 . Taken together, these findings show that NALT contains all of the immunocompetent cells that are required for the induction and regulation of antigen-specific T H 1-or T H 2-cell-mediated responses and B-cell immune responses.",

            "text": "NALT and Peyer's patches are thought to have similar immunological characteristics and biological functions, as well as to contain the same types of resident immunocompetent cell. So, similar to oral immunization, nasal immunization can stimulate antigen-specific T H 1-or T H 2-cell-mediated responses and IgA responses in distant mucosal effector tissues 1, 2, 41, [43] [44] [45] . However, in general, NALT-targeted immunization effectively induces antigen-specific immunity in the respiratory and reproductive tissues, whereas Peyer's-patch-targeted immunization promotes the generation of protective immunity in the gastrointestinal-tract tissues 1,2 . Further support for a compartmentalized CMIS was provided recently when it was shown that nasal immunization induces the expression of high levels of CCR10 and \u03b1 4 \u03b2 1 -integrin by IgA-committed B cells, allowing them to efficiently traffic to the respiratory and genito-urinary tracts, which express the corresponding ligands, CCL28 and VCAM1 (REFS 71, 72) . By contrast, orally induced IgAcommitted B cells express CCR9 and CCR10, as well as \u03b1 4 \u03b2 7and \u03b1 4 \u03b2 1 -integrins, so they migrate to sites such as the small intestine, which express CCL25 and/or CCL28 together with MADCAM1 and/or VCAM1 (REF. 73 ). So, despite NALT and Peyer's patches both belonging to the mucosal immune system, the subtle differences that we have discussed indicate that the tissue genesis and biological functions of NALT and Peyer's patches might differ because of their anatomically and the Peyer's patches 59 cast these assumptions into doubt. Stromal-cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 present in the intestinal lamina propria was shown to trigger IgM + B220 + cells to switch to IgA + B cells 59 . Mice with a deficiency in the programmed-inflammation-associated cytokine LT-\u03b1 do not form Peyer's patches, so the levels of IgA responses are reduced compared with those of wildtype mice 60 . However, reconstitution of Lt-\u03b1 -/mice with LT-expressing bone-marrow cells, or transplantation of an intestinal segment from recombinationactivating gene (Rag) -/mice to Lt-\u03b1 -/mice, resulted in the recovery of IgA responses 60 . These findings imply that at least some IgA-committed B cells can develop, even in the absence of Peyer's patches. Lt-\u03b1 -/mice have also been shown to be capable of inducing antigenspecific IgA responses to orally administered Salmonella typhimurium, despite the absence of organized lymphoid tissues associated with the mucosal compartment 61 . Although these findings provide supporting evidence that the environment of the diffuse lamina propria region is self-sufficient for the \u00b5to \u03b1-gene CSR that leads to the generation of IgA-committed B cells, it is also possible that unidentified, programmedinflammation-independent miniature lymphoid aggregates, and recently characterized isolated lymphoid follicles 62 , have a role in mounting IgA responses in cases of Peyer's-patch deficiency.",

Because it has been shown that intestinal IgA is produced by two groups of cells, B1 cells and B2 CELLS 63, 65, 66 , an interesting possibility is that IgA-specific CSR of B1 cells does not require organized lymphoid structures, whereas these structures are essential for IgA-isotype switching in B2 cells. In support of this view, we have shown that most B cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues are B2 cells, whereas B1 cells are located preferentially in the intestinal laminapropria region 66 . So, we think that the initial antigenic stimulation for the triggering of IgA-isotype switching in B2 cells might be provided by antigen sampling through M cells that are located in the dome epithelium (or FAE) of Peyer's patches. By contrast, the IgA-specific CSR process that occurs for B1 cells might be triggered by antigens sampled through newly identified villous M cells that are located adjacent to lamina-propria regions that do not contain observable lymphoid-like structures 67 .",

When this delivery vehicle was used, intranasally administered antigen that was conjugated to green-fluorescent protein successfully reached the antigen-sampling M cells that are located in the epithelium of NALT 75 . Fusogenic liposomes were also found to effectively deliver antigen to epithelial cells and macrophages in both NALT and the nasal passages 75 . Furthermore, it was shown that an intranasally administered HVJ liposome containing the HIV glycoprotein 160 antigen (gp160; also known as env) was a powerful tool for inducing gp160-specific serum IgG, and gp160specific mucosal IgA was also detected in nasal wash, saliva, faecal extract and vaginal wash 76 (TABLE 2) . These findings show that the novel hybrid antigen-delivery vehicle of fusogenic liposomes (or HVJ liposomes) effectively transports vaccine antigen to NALT for the initiation of antigen-specific IgA responses at distant mucosal effector sites.

One promising approach has been to use a molecule that is involved in the normal course of invasion of an infectious agent. Reovirus, an enteric pathogen, is known to invade its host through M cells that are located in the epithelium of Peyer's patches 78 . The 45-kDa viral haemagglutinin \u03c31 protein of reovirus has a crucial role in its attachment to and entry into M cells 79 . The virus has been shown to recognize mouse M cells that are present in the airways 80 , and the recombinant form of the \u03c31 protein can bind to M cells that are associated with NALT epithelium 80 . On the basis of these findings, attempts have been made to develop an M-cell-targeted DNA vaccine using the \u03c31 protein as a guiding molecule 81 . When conjugated to a eukaryotic expression vector that encodes luciferase (known as pCMVLuc) and administered intranasally, the \u03c31 protein can specifically bind to the apical surface of M cells that are situated in the follicular epithelium environmentally distinct locations. Targeting the CMIS would therefore seem to be a logical choice for the development of a second generation mucosal (nasal or oral) vaccine to induce antigen-specific immune responsessuch as a combination of T H 1-cell or T H 2-cell responses, CTL responses, and IgA and IgG responses -in the common and/or selective regions of the mucosal compartments, as well as at systemic sites, through the use of the NALT-and Peyer's-patch-initiated mucosal immune responses (FIG. 1) .",

Nasal vaccination has proven to be an effective regimen for the stimulation of the respiratory immune system 1, 2, 41, 45 . Furthermore, this route of mucosal immunization can elicit both humoral and cellmediated antigen-specific immune responses 1, 2, 41, [43] [44] [45] . Another attractive feature of nasal immunization is that it requires a much smaller dose of antigen than does oral vaccination for the induction of antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses, because the antigens are not exposed to degradation by digestive enzymes. Because intranasal administration of vaccine antigen alone has failed to fully stimulate NALT, researchers are attempting to develop an effective NALT-targeted vaccine-antigen delivery system and to develop a safe and effective immune-enhancing molecule (or adjuvant) for intranasal administration with the vaccine antigen.",

            "text": "Antigens are known to be more immunogenic in particulate form than in soluble form, but they are vulnerable to antigen-degrading enzymes and acids that are associated with the mucosal environment. To overcome these obstacles, much effort has been focused on the creation of novel non-toxic and non-immunogenic vaccine vehicles that can effectively deliver even the soluble form of antigen to the organized mucosal inductive tissue. Such vehicles need to protect vaccine components from degradation, enhance their uptake from mucosal surfaces and perhaps function as an adjuvant. Among the various candidates for mucosal antigen delivery, Sendai-virus-associated fusion protein seems particularly suited to function as a molecule that of cholera toxin (nCT) and heat-labile enterotoxin (nLT) cause severe diarrhoea and so are unsuitable for use in humans. To overcome these hurdles, researchers have substituted a single amino acid to generate non-toxic mutant forms of cholera toxin (mCT) and heat-labile enterotoxin (mLT) [85] [86] [87] [88] ; these retain the adjuvanticity of the native forms but do not induce the ribosylation of ADP that is associated with toxic activity. Our efforts to devise a safe first generation toxin-based adjuvant have focused on mCT S61F (in which phenylalanine replaces serine at position 61) and mCT E112K (in which lysine replaces glutamic acid at position 112); these mutations were created by making a single amino-acid substitution in the active centre of the ADP-ribosyltransferase in the A subunit of cholera toxin 89 . The two mutant forms of cholera toxin have been shown to be safe by in vitro analyses of ADP-ribosylation activity and cyclic AMP formation, as well as by in vivo examination for diarrhoea-like symptoms. When pneumococcal surface-protein A (PspA) -a new candidate vaccine antigen for preventing infection with Streptococcus pneumoniaewas intranasally administered with mCT, antigenspecific mucosal IgA and systemic IgG responses were elicited 90 . Mice intranasally immunized with PspA and mCT were also protected against a lethal challenge with S. pneumoniae 90 . Interestingly, when the tetanustoxoid vaccine (which is currently administered by injection) was intranasally administered with one of these two mCTs, it generated protective immunity against challenge with the toxin 91 . An independent study has also shown that mCT E112K is the safest and most effective of the currently available toxin-based mutant adjuvants 92 . Taken together, these findings support the idea that mCT is a strong candidate for an effective mucosal adjuvant to generate protective immunity by the nasal route of administration. Indeed, these findings indicate that the current preference for injection-type vaccines should be reconsidered, and in future, greater use should be made of spray-type vaccines that include mCT and other safe toxin-based adjuvants (BOX 1) . To further enhance the efficacy of the mCT mucosal adjuvant, a second-generation, chimeric-type adjuvant was constructed from the A subunit of mCT (mCTA) and the B subunit of nLT (nLTB); therefore, the adjuvant has the immunobiological properties of both cholera toxin and heat-labile enterotoxin 93 . Nasal immunization with influenza-virus haemagglutinin plus the newly created chimeric mucosal adjuvant mCTA-nLTB resulted in significant haemagglutininspecific serum IgG and IgA responses 93 (TABLE 2 ). In addition, mice that were intranasally immunized with haemagglutinin and mCTA-nLTB showed high levels of haemagglutinin-specific IgA in nasal and lung washes and were protected from viral challenge 93 . These findings show that nasal vaccines containing mCT or mCTA-nLTB are effective for the induction of protective immunity. The goal of mucosal-vaccine development cannot be realized without the creation of such novel and safe mucosal adjuvants. of NALT; it then leads to the generation of luciferasespecific serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses 80 . A nasal vaccine assembled using the \u03c31 protein and gp160 resulted in gp160-specific CTL responses in various mucosa-associated and systemic immune compartments, including reproductive tissue and spleen respectively 81 . These findings further emphasize the efficacy of NALT-targeted immunization for the induction of humoral and/or cell-mediated antigen-specific immune responses in mucosal and systemic immune compartments.",

Indeed, systemic administration of rBCG that expresses HIV antigen has been shown to effectively induce cell-mediated immunity 43, 83 . Our own studies have shown that intransal administration of rBCG that expresses V3J1, a neutralizing epitope of HIV, can induce V3-peptide-specific IgG that has neutralizing activity for more than 0.5-1 years in both normal and immunodeficient (interferon-\u03b3-deficient or Il-4 -/-) mice 43 (TABLE 2) .

NALT and Peyer's patches are important inductive sites for the initiation of antigen-specific mucosal IgA and serum IgG responses, as well as CTL immune responses, at both mucosal and systemic sites; in this way, both NALT and Peyer's patches function to maximize the two-tiered immunological barrier of the host. The respiratory mucosal immune system has several immunological characteristics that are distinct from those of the Peyer's-patch-centred intestinal mucosal immune system. Although the tissuegenesis programme for other secondary lymphoid tissues, including Peyer's patches, begins during embryonic life, the NALT-organogenesis programme is initiated only after birth. Lymphoid organogenesis of Peyer's patches requires cytokine-mediated programmed inflammation (through the LT-\u03b2R) and signalling through the IL-7R, whereas the initiation of NALT development seems to be independent of the IL-7R, LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 and the LT-\u03b2R. Although the inducer cells for both NALT and Peyer's patches have a common phenotype, that is, CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + , NALTinducer cells seem to be regulated by ID2 alone, whereas Peyer's-patch-inducer cells depend on both ID2 and ROR-\u03b3. Because the organogenesis programme of NALT is different from that of other secondary lymphoid tissues, such as Peyer's patches, efforts should now be aimed at elucidating the distinct molecular characteristics of the NALT-genesis programme and the functional consequences of this. Clearly, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the unique molecular and cellular properties of the NALT-centred mucosal immune system for the development of a successful nasal vaccine.",

In recent years, two types of intranasally administered influenza vaccine, an inactivated form and a live attenuated form, were introduced in Switzerland and the United States respectively. Indeed, as early as 1997, an inactivated form of nasal vaccine containing a small amount of nLT as a mucosal adjuvant was introduced in Switzerland. However, this influenza vaccine was withdrawn from the market because of the development of BELL'S PALSY by some recipients after nasal vaccination. A causal relationship between the intranasally administered inactivatedinfluenza vaccine used in Switzerland and the incidence of Bell's palsy was formally established in a recent case-control study 96 . At this stage, the causes and pathogenesis of Bell's palsy remain unclear; however, because nLT has been shown to have proinflammatory properties and possible neurological toxicity 97 , the co-formulated nLT that is present in the inactivated-influenza vaccine is suspected to be the causative agent 98 . These findings highlight that the development of a safe mucosal adjuvant is crucial if progress is to be made towards a safe and effective mucosal vaccine.",

It should be noted that the concept of cold-adapted influenza virus was reported in 1967 (REF. 101 ), so more than 35 years were required for this discovery to be translated into an intransal vaccine against infection with influenza virus. More recently, the concept of nasal immunization was adopted for the development of a vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

The NASOPHARYNX-ASSOCIATED LYMPHOID-TISSUE (NALT) ANLAGEN from one-week-old mice shows a small accumulation of lymphoid cells around a single PNAD-expressing HEV in the nasal tissue. In eight-week-old mice, NALT contains numerous PNAD-expressing HEVs. This figure is reproduced with permission from REF.5 \uf8e9 Elsevier (2002). b | The formation of NALT therefore starts after birth, whereas the development of Peyer's patches is initiated during embryogenesis. c | These kinetic differences in the initiation of tissue genesis of NALT and Peyer's patches are also supported by the appearance and frequency of CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + inducer cells in nasal and intestinal tissues. The inducer cells accumulate postnatally at the site of NALT formation, whereas high numbers of these cells are observed in Peyer's patches during the gestational period. E, embryonic day.",

ID2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) is indispensable for the induction and differentiation of these inducer cells from their fetal-liver precursors (which have the phenotype CD3 -CD4 -CD45 + ). a | For Peyer's patches, after activation through the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) or TRANCE (tumour-necrosis-factor-related activation-induced cytokine), these CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + cells express the lymphotoxin-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 (LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 ) heterotrimer, which then binds to the LT-\u03b2 receptor (LT-\u03b2R) displayed on stromal cells and induces signal transduction through NIK (nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-inducing kinase). In turn, NIK promotes the expression of adhesion molecules and/or chemokines. These homing molecules trigger the accumulation of lymphoid cells at the site of Peyer's patches. So, the IL-7R-and LT-\u03b2R-mediated signals are essential for the tissue genesis of Peyer's patches. b | The development of CD3 -CD4 + CD45 + cells in nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) also requires ID2; however, the initiation of NALT organogenesis is independent of signalling that involves the IL-7R, LT-\u03b1 1 \u03b2 2 -LT-\u03b2R interactions and NIK.

Characterization of the mRNA that encodes T H 1 and T H 2 cytokines in CD4 + T cells isolated from mouse NALT revealed a dominant cytokine profile of T H 0 CELLS, indicating that these T cells are capable of becoming T H 1 or T H 2 cells immediately after antigen exposure of the nasal tract[41][42][43] . CD4 + T cells isolated from NALT of naive wild-type mice are T H 0 cells 42 , so they can become either T H 1 or T H 2 cells depending on the identity of the nasally administered antigen. Nasal delivery of protein antigens (such as bacterial cell-wall components or virus-associated antigens) together with cholera toxin as a mucosal adjuvant induces antigenspecific T H 2-type responses that promote the generation of antigen-specific IgA-producing B cells, both in the nasal passages and at distant mucosal effector sites, including the genito-urinary, respiratory and intestinal tracts41,44,45 . By contrast, intranasal vaccination with antigen-expressing recombinant Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (rBCG) results in T H 1-cell-mediated immunity43 .IgA class switching.Peyer's patches have long been thought to be the sites for the initiation of CLASS-SWITCH RECOMBINATION (CSR) of \u00b5to \u03b1-gene expression in the gastrointestinal tract, because they contain all of the cellular and microarchitectural elements that are required for the generation of IgA-committed B cells, including germinal-centre-containing B-cell follicles, a FOLLICULAR DC network and an interfollicular T-cell area1,46,47 .",
