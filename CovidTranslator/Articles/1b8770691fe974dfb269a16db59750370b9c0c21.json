            "text": "Background: Household studies provide opportunities to understand influenza-like-illness (ILI) transmission, but data from (sub)tropical developing countries are scarce. Objective: To determine the viral etiology and epidemiology of ILI in households. Study design: ILI was detected by active case finding amongst a cohort of 263 northern Vietnam households between 2008 and 2013. Health workers collected nose and throat swabs for virus detection by multiplex real-time RT-PCR. Results: ILI was detected at least once in 219 (23.7%) of 945 household members. 271 (62.3%) of 435 nose/throat swabs were positive for at least one of the 15 viruses tested. Six viruses predominated amongst positive swabs: Rhinovirus (28%), Influenza virus (17%), Coronavirus (8%), Enterovirus (5%), Respiratory syncytial virus (3%), Metapneumovirus virus (2.5%) and Parainfluenza virus 3 (1.8%). There was no clear seasonality, but 78% of episodes occurred in Winter/Spring for Influenza compared to 32% for Rhinovirus. Participants, on average, suffered 0.49 ILI, and 0.29 virus-positive ILI episodes, with no significant effects of gender, age, or household size. In contrast to US and Australian community studies, the frequency of ILI decreased as the number of household members aged below 5 years increased (p = 0.006). Conclusion: The findings indicate the need for tailored ILI control strategies, and for better understanding of how local childcare practices and seasonality may influence transmission and the role of children.",

Household cohort studies are fundamental for understanding respiratory virus transmission [10] . There is a wealth of information regarding influenza virus transmission in households [11, 12] , but relatively few studies characterize non-influenza virus transmission. In 2007, we established a household cohort in Ha Nam, northern Vietnam, and have conducted active ILI surveillance to http describe influenza epidemiology [12] [13] [14] .

Participants with ILI also self-presented to the commune health service. ILI was defined as an oral temperature of at least 38 \u2022 C together with cough or sore throat. The current study assessed ILI occurring between September 2008 and August 2013, but excluded the year between September of 2009 and 2010, when protocols were adjusted due to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 98 ILI episodes were detected during this pandemic period and 25% were H1N1 2009 pandemic strain positive.

Rhinovirus was detected most frequently (n = 124, 28% of swabs), followed by Influenza virus (n = 72, 17%), Coronavirus (8%), Enterovirus (5%), RSV (3%), MPV (2.5%) and PIV3 (1.8%) (Fig. 2a) . Remaining viruses were detected in less than 1% of swabs. Rhinovirus-positive swabs were from 96 (10%) participants from 63 households, representing 43% of participants with ILI. Influenza virus-positive swabs were from 67 participants from 49 households, representing 31% of participants with ILI. Influenza virus B, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 (four Brisbane/59/2007-like cases, nineteen A/Cal/07/2009-like cases) were detected in similar numbers of swabs (Fig. 2b) . Seven swabs tested positive for both Rhinovirus and Enterovirus, and two swabs each contained Rhinovirus and Influenza virus B, or MPV and Bocavirus. All other virus combinations were detected in a single swab (Fig. 2b) . Enterovirus was distinct in that 11 (52%) of 21 positive swabs contained additional viruses (Fig. 2b ). Table 1 ranks common viruses according to the proportions of affected participants and households that had multiple infections. Rhinoviruses ranked high compared to Coronaviruses. Enteroviruses affected four individuals multiple times but rarely affected other household members, whereas multiple members were affected in a quarter to a third of households with Influenza, RSV or MPV. To investigate whether clustering of these viruses reflects household transmission, episodes were classified as being temporally related if detection intervals were between 1 and 10 days [16] . Twenty-four temporally related clusters were detected in 19 households (Table 2 ). Ten Rhinovirus clusters were detected in nine households, accounting for 45% of 20 households with multiple Rhinovirus cases. Influenza cases were temporally related in seven households, accounting for 58% of households with multiple cases. RSV cases were temporally related in all households with multiple cases.

            "text": "Around two thirds of ILI case swabs were positive for respiratory viruses, this proportion exceeded 70% for children, and decreased with age, similar to other studies [2, 4, [17] [18] [19] [20] . Rhinovirus was detected in around half of the virus-positive ILI episodes, and was the most common virus, followed by Influenza virus or Coronavirus, RSV, MPV and PIV3, as in the recent Michigan household study [4] . Similarly, half of the virus-positive ILI cases detected amongst adults in the community in Australia were Rhinoviruses, with Influenza and Coronaviruses the next most common [3] . Interestingly, Rhinoviruses also predominated in ILI patients of all ages admitted to hospitals in Vietnam between July 2008 and June 2009 [20] . We did not have sufficient numbers to reliably describe the etiology of ILI in young children, other than to conclude that Rhinoviruses predominated, consistent with studies elsewhere [2] . Influenza virus accounted for a higher proportion of ILI amongst participants of the current study (17%), who have never received influenza vaccine, compared to studies in which more that half of the participants have been vaccinated (\u223c11%) [3, 4] . Furthermore, in the study of Howard et al., individual with influenza were less likely to have been vaccinated compared to the influenza virus negative group [3] . MPV was less common than in the Michigan study [4] , and in community studies involving children [2] but not adults [3] , and we and others found that MPV was more common in children aged 6-12 years [21] , suggesting an effect of the type of household included and their age structures. Similarly, RSV detection was low in the current study compared to studies with higher proportions of young children [2, 4] . The detection of influenza virus in only 17% of ILI episodes, and the absence of seasonal trends for influenza, indicate that ILI surveillance may be of limited value for under-standing influenza epidemiology if not combined with laboratory confirmation, in agreement with other studies [6, 7, 19] . Children did not contribute substantially to ILI burden or transmission in this study. In contrast, young children experienced significantly more ARI episodes than older age groups, and people from households with young children also experienced significantly more ARI episodes in the recent Michigan study [4] . Similarly, a study of adult index case households in Australia found significantly more ILI transmission if a child was present [22] , and children were considered to be the main driving force for ARI transmission in the 1960/70s Tecumseh study [23] . It follows that if ILI predominates in children, they will frequently be involved in household transmission, either as index or contact cases. Differences in observations for children could reflect study design: the Michigan study only recruited households with at least four participants, and at least two children, and the case definition included milder illness. However, effects were maintained when analysis was restricted to households with at least four participants. In our previous analysis we found that influenza infection was not associated with the presence of children in the household or with caring for children if an adult [13] . Therefore differences in the role of children in household ILI may reflect differences in factors affecting transmission such as seasonality, contact patterns [24] and childcare practices. Childcare centre attendance significantly increased the rate of ILI, by 40%, amongst children in Australian communities [2] . School-based transmission may also be less intense in (sub)tropical settings because virus circulation is more constant, rather than seasonal, potentially reducing the pool of susceptible children [13] . A study of age-specific seasonality for Influenza and RSV in Hong Kong similarly concluded that none of the age groups consistently appear as the driving force for seasonal epidemics [25] . School closure has been adopted as an ILI control strategy based on studies that indicate that children are a major driving force for ILI transmission [26] . A statistical model using sentinel surveillance data from France also indicates that in this setting, where ILI predominates in children, 16-17% of cases may be prevented by school closure. The data presented in the current study indicate that school closure may have limited effect in this setting.",

However, the current study did not indicate a predominance of illness among young children or an impact of the presence of young children within households. Therefore, the strategy of targeting interventions to children needs further consideration, and understanding of effects of seasonality, childcare utilization, household structure and contact patterns.",
