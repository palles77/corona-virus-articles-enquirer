            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding mechanism commonly used by RNA viruses to express two or more proteins from a single mRNA at a fixed ratio. An essential element in this process is the presence of an RNA secondary structure, such as a pseudoknot or a hairpin, located downstream of the slippery sequence. Here, we have tested the efficiency of RNA oligonucleotides annealing downstream of the slippery sequence to induce frameshifting in vitro. Maximal frameshifting was observed with oligonucleotides of 12-18 nt. Antisense oligonucleotides bearing locked nucleid acid (LNA) modifications also proved to be efficient frameshift-stimulators in contrast to DNA oligonucleotides. The number, sequence and location of LNA bases in an otherwise DNA oligonucleotide have to be carefully manipulated to obtain optimal levels of frameshifting. Our data favor a model in which RNA stability at the entrance of the ribosomal tunnel is the major determinant of stimulating slippage rather than a specific three-dimensional structure of the stimulating RNA element.",

            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding event that increases the versatility of gene expression. It is mainly utilized by eukaryotic RNA viruses (1) (2) (3) , though some prokaryotic (4) and mammalian genes (5) (6) (7) are also controlled by ribosomal frameshifting. The requirements for \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting are the presence of a slippery heptanucleotide sequence X XXY YYZ (where X can be A, U, G or C; Y can be A or U; and Z does not equal Y; the spaces indicate the original reading frame) (8) followed by a downstream structural element, such as a pseudoknot, a hairpin or an antisense oligonucleotide duplex [for reviews, see (9) ]. Although the mechanism of frameshifting is still elusive, a promising model has been proposed by Brierley and co-workers using cryo-electron microscopy to image mammalian 80S ribosomes (10) . In their model, the ribosome is paused by its inability to unwind a pseudoknot structure resulting in a blockage of the A-site by eEF-2. During translocation, the P-site tRNA is bent in the 3 0 -direction by opposing forces. To release the tension, the P-site tRNA may un-pair and subsequently re-pair in the \u00c01 frame with a certain frequency, followed by A-site tRNA delivery into the new \u00c01 reading frame. These and other recent data obtained by mechanical unfolding of frameshifter pseudoknots suggest that mRNA secondary structures with certain conformational features that resist ribosomal helicase-mediated unwinding and eEF-2 catalyzed translocation are key players in ribosomal frameshifting.",

Various kinds of modifications in backbones, sugars or even analogs have already been studied extensively [for reviews, see (22, 23) ] to meet these requirements. Locked nucleic acid (LNA) is a rather novel nucleic acid analog comprising a class of bicyclic high-affinity RNA analogs in which the furanose ring of LNA monomers is conformationally locked in an RNA-mimicking C3 0 -endo/ N-type conformation (24) . The LNA modification also resists degradation by cellular nucleases. Furthermore, introducing LNA into DNA or RNA oligonucleotides improves the affinity for complementary sequences and increases the melting temperature by several degrees (25) . A recent study showed that LNA/DNA mix-mers against miRNA-122 can be acutely administered at high dosage with long lasting effects without any evidence of LNA-associated toxicities or histopathological changes in the studied animals (26) . These data suggests that LNA is a promising candidate for small oligonucleotide applications.",

Increasing the number of LNAs from one to two and four in these DNA oligonucleotides improved their frameshift inducing ability, reaching an apparent optimum of 7.0% with four LNA substitutions. Further increase of the LNA content to 6 nt (LD6) did not improve frameshift efficiency, but, on the other hand, LD6 also did not lead to the dramatic decrease as observed above for the LNA6 oligonucleotide applied in the SF468 construct. We suspected that (partial) self-complementarity may be limiting the effective concentration of free LNA/DNA oligonucleotides. To check this possibility, we ran all the oligonucleotides on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Figure 5 showes that the LNA6 oligonucleotide indeed migrated more slowly indicative of partial dimer formation, presumably by intermolecular base pairing of the palindromic GCGCGC sequences in each oligonucleotide (compare the migration to that of the full dimer formed by annealing of oligonucleotides DNA18 and 18DNA). The LD series, as predicted, migrated as monomers. We noted that LD2, though loaded in equal amount, based on its UV absorbance, showed a higher affinity to ethidium bromide than its counterparts. At present we have no explanation for this unexpected behavior of LD2, since its migration and therefore its conformation was identical to the other LNA/DNA mix-mers.",

Replacing 2 nt in a DNA oligonucleotide by LNA was already sufficient to reach the same level of frameshifting as with a comparable RNA oligonucleotide. However, the excellent affinity of LNA oligonucleotides could be a double-edged sword in certain cases. In our experimental system, the oligonucleotides are partly self-complementary and this resulted in the formation of dimers ( Figure 5 ), which were apparently unable to induce frameshifting (LNA6, Figure 3 ). Hence, LNA substitutions should be optimized in a sequence that is prone to form dimers. In our SF462 construct (Figure 4) , the optimal number of LNA substitutions to induce the most significant amount of frameshifting is four. LD6 with two additional LNA substitutions did not improve the efficiency. Thus, our results suggest that the first 4 bp are critical for antisense-induced frameshifting. A likely explanation is that when a ribosome that is translating the slippery sequence, the helicase active site is around position +11, with respect to the first nucleotide of the P-site, which is close to the first base pair of the mRNA/ oligonucleotide duplex (35) . Increasing the local thermodynamic stability in this region may prevent ribosomes to unwind RNA structures, causing ribosomal pausing at the slippery sequence, and finally results in a higher frequency of ribosomal frameshifting.",

Here such a spacing was less efficient (see data for L2-4, Figure 6 ).

            "text": "The finding that local stability at the 3 0 -end of the LNA/ DNA mix-mers is important for frameshifting is in agreement with the observation that in natural examples of frameshift stimulators, most of them have high GC content in the first few nucleotides (1) . Hence, our data support the notion that the stability of the 3 0 -end of the oligonucleotide, which may reside in the active site of the ribosomal helicase, is critical for frameshift-inducing structural elements. In pseudoknots this stability is probably attained by triple interactions, since nature has no other way to increase the stability of a GC-rich A-type helix. Triplex structures have been documented for a number of frameshifter pseudoknots, e.g. BWYV (37), SRV\u00c01 (38) and in a telomerase pseudoknot (39) . Several models of ribosomal frameshifting have been proposed (1, 40, 41) . The consistency from these studies is that ribosomal pausing at shifty sites by downstream structural elements is important but that pausing caused by RNA secondary structure, does not always result in frameshifting. In addition, a lack of correlation between the extent of pausing and the efficiency of frameshifting by IBV pseudoknots has been observed (42) . A recent study also showed that pseudoknots with a similar global structure can still induce very different levels of frameshifting although their thermodynamic stabilities were different (43) . These data complicate the view on the role of the downstream structure. Experiments involving simple oligonucleotides such as shown here may be better alternatives to elucidate the role of the downstream element.",

Since we showed here that antisense oligonucleotides can induce frameshifting presumably by serving as a physical barrier for the elongating ribosome, it will be interesting to measure the strength of these linear oligonucleotides in complex with (a piece of) mRNA by optical tweezers and see if there is a correlation with their frameshifting efficiency.",
