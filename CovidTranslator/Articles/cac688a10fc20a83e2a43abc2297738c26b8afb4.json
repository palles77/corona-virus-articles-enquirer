The purpose of this study was to identify the causative agents and epidemiological characteristics of diarrhea in Korean native calves (KNC). In total, 207 diarrheal KNC aged less than 7 months were investigated. Fecal samples collected from the rectum were examined for causative agents using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR and the number of oocysts were counted. Fourteen causative agents were detected from 164 of the 207 diarrheal KNC. Rotavirus was the most common agent (34.8%), followed by Eimeria spp. (31.7%), Escherichia coli (22.0%), Giardia spp. (14.0%), Clostridium difficile (9.8%), bovine viral diarrhea virus (8.5%), coronavirus (7.9%), Cryptosporidium spp. (7.3%), torovirus (6.7%), parvovirus (5.5%), norovirus (4.9%), kobuvirus (1.8%), adenovirus (1.2%), and Salmonella spp. (0.6%). About 95 (57.9%) of 164 calves were infected with a single causative agent and 42.1% were infected by multiple agents. No significant difference was observed in mortality between calves infected with a single agent and multiple agents. The occurrence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus, Eimeria spp., kobuvirus, and Giardia spp. was significantly different based on onset age, and the prevalence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus or C. difficile was significantly different between seasons. This study help the understanding of KNC diarrhea for the development of an effective strategy for disease prevention and control, especially in Eastern provinces of South Korea.",

The amplified products were visualized using electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, which were stained with ethidium bromide. For isolation of Salmonella spp., fecal samples were inoculated in 9 mL of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) R10 broth (BD, USA) and incubated at 42\u00b0C for 24 h. A loopful of RV culture was streaked onto CHROMagar Salmonella Plus (CHROMagar, France). PCR for invA gene of Salmonella spp. was carried out.",

Coccidiosis, a disease commonly observed in young cattle (1-2 months to 1 year), is usually sporadic during the wet seasons of the year. Diarrhea due to Eimeria spp. was the most prevalent between 5 and 6 weeks of age in KNC (the mean age: 57 days old). Diarrhea due to Giardia was also most prevalent between 5 and 6 weeks of age (the mean age: 38.1 days old), and all diarrhea caused by Giardia spp. occurred between 2 and 10 weeks of age. Other studies have reported that the most prevalent age for diarrhea due to Eimeria spp. was 4.7 to 12 weeks [3] , with a mean age of 55 days (median: 49 days old), in southern Germany [21] . The mean age of diarrhea caused by Giardia spp. was 46.5 days (median: 42 days old) in southern Germany [21] , and the mean ages of diarrhea caused by Eimeria spp. and Giardia spp. in southern Germany were very similar to those reported in the present study.",

In the present study, the prevalence of diarrhea was 46.3% in spring, 13.4% in summer, 7.9% in fall, and 32.3% in winter. Spring was the most dangerous season because the morbidity and mortality rates associated with diarrhea in diarrheal calves were the highest in this season. A previous study in south-west France reported that the month of birth was significantly associated with morbidity: The highest morbidity rates were observed in December and March, and the mortality rate was two times higher in December than in other months [6] . In the present study, the incidence of calf diarrhea increased in proportion to the number of calf births in spring. In summer and fall, the incidence of diarrhea decreased in proportion to the number of calf births. In winter, however, the ratio of diarrheal calves to calf births was doubled. As the number of calf births in spring is the highest, diarrhea occurs more frequently owing to changes in temperature and the increased chance of contact with causative agents of calf diarrhea. In winter, few calf births were reported, but the calves appeared to be more exposed to causative agents and diarrhea. These infections became more severe, owing to the decreased resistance of calves upon exposure to the cold weather. The reason underlying the increase in mortality and morbidity was associated with the rotaviral infection of calves. Rotavirus-associated mortality was the highest component (46.7%) of total mortality. This observation is consistent with the most frequent rotavirus infection within 1 week of age, especially in spring and winter. In general, viruses tend to be more stable during the cold season, presumably owing to low temperatures. The prevalence of diarrhea caused by rotavirus was significantly different between seasons.",
