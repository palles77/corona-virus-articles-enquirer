            "text": "Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) is a novel virus that has been found widely distributed in the swine population in recent years. Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of TTSuV1. In this study, synonymous codon usage patterns and the key determinants in the coding region of 29 available complete TTSuV1 genome sequences were examined. By calculating the nucleotide content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of TTSuV1 coding sequences, we found that the preferentially used codons were mostly those ending with A or C nucleotides; less-used codons were mostly codons ending with U or G nucleotides, and these were mainly affected by composition constraints. Although there was a variation in codon usage bias among different TTSuV1 genomes, the codon usage bias and GC content in the TTSuV1 coding region was lower, which was mainly determined by the base composition in the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. Moreover, the results of correspondence analysis (COA) indicated that the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolated from different countries varied greatly and had significant differences. In addition, Spearman's rank correlation analysis and an ENC plot revealed that apart from mutation pressure, which was critical in determining the codon usage pattern, other factors were involved in shaping the evolution of codon usage bias in TTSuV1, such as natural selection. Those results suggested that synonymous codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 genomes were the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection. The information from this study not only provides important insights into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV1, but also helps to identify the main factors affecting codon usage by this virus.",

            "text": "It is well known that the genetic code is composed of 61 codons to represent the 20 standard amino acids, and three codons to represent termination signals (UAA, UAG, UGA). Alternative codons encoding the same amino acid are termed ''synonymous codons''. In general, each amino acid can be encoded by one (Met, Tyr) or more (up to six) synonymous codons. Previous studies have indicated that synonymous codons are not favored equally within a genome, and members of some species and some genes preferentially use one or several particular synonymous codons. The higher frequency of these preferred codons is called ''codon bias''. Genes from different species or the same species have their own bias of synonymous codon usage [1, 2] . However, mutations resulting in synonymous codons tend to occur in the third base position, and the codons can be interchanged without altering the primary sequence of the protein product. Generally, compositional constraints under mutational pressure and translation selection in nature have been found to be the two main factors accounting for codon usage variation among genes [3] [4] [5] . In some genes with extremely high A ? T or G ? C content [3, [6] [7] [8] , mutation pressure plays an important role in affecting the synonymous codon usage pattern. In addition, synonymous codon usage bias is also related with to the processes of DNA replication and transcription [9] , gene structure, protein secondary structures [10] [11] [12] and environmental conditions [13] .",

TTV was first detected in a human patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology in 1997 [17] and was then later detected in many other vertebrate animals and domesticated farm animals, such as chickens, pigs, cows and sheep [18] [19] [20] [21] . In swine, two genetically distinct viruses, torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), have been found [22, 23] . Sequence analysis has shown that the TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genomes are only 44 % homologous [23] . Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) are widely distributed and have been detected in serum, plasma, semen, colostrum, feces and tissues of swine [24] [25] [26] [27] . Because a definitive pathogenic role of this virus has not been demonstrated, it is considered a non-virulent commensal inhabitant of vertebrates. Although TTSuV infection in swine has not directly lead to any diseases and is considered non-pathogenic, the virus still plays an important role in co-infection. It is considered to be a symbiotic virus in vertebrates, and it is associated with economically important diseases.",

In the coding region, three open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 (also known as ORF1/1 and ORF2/2), have been found, and the three ORFs have many overlapping genes. Previous studies have confirmed that the Rep protein is encoded by the largest open reading frame (ORF1), which encodes mostly highly hydrophilic viral capsid proteins.

Codons AUG and UGG are the only codons for Met and Trp, respectively, and the termination codons UAA, UAG and UGA do not encode any amino acids. Therefore, these five codons would not exhibit any usage bias and were therefore excluded from this study.",

The ENC value ranges from 20, for a gene in which only one of the possible synonymous codons is used for each amino acid, to 61, for a gene in which all synonymous codons are used equally [29] . If the ENC value is closer to 20, the codon usage bias is stronger, and the degree to which codons are used non-randomly is higher. It is generally accepted that genes have a significant codon bias when the ENC value is less than or equal to 35. Thus, the ENC value provides an intuitively meaningful estimate of the codon preference in a gene. This method was used in this study to evaluate the degree of codon usage bias in the TTSuV1 coding region.",

In order to investigate the codon usage pattern of TTSuV1, we calculated various RSCU values of various codons from 29 TTSuV1 coding sequences. The overall RSCU values of 59 codons in the TTSuV1 coding region are listed in Table 3 . As shown in Table 2 , we found that A % and A 3 % were the highest, with average values of 32.72 % and 37.45 %. U % and U 3 % were the lowest, with average values of 19.20 % and 25.90 %. G % (25.70 %) was higher than C % (22.39 %), while G 3 % (30.82 %) was lower than C 3 % (32.63 %), indicating that the TTSuV1 coding region might preferentially use A-ended synonymous codons over U-ended synonymous codons. In addition, compared with other vertebrate DNA viruses, the TTSuV1 genome had a lower and stable GC %, ranging from 47.2 % to 51.2 %, with an average value of 49.6 %. The GC 3 % was also lower and stable, ranging from 47.5 % to 52.4 %, with an average value of 49.6 %. The average value of GC 3 % was similar to that of GC %, indicating that GC 3 % was mainly affected by GC %. Hence, the fact that the GC content was lower in TTSuV1 coding sequences and that the codons ending in C were used in a biased way suggested that the content of G or C at the third position of the codon had an effect on the synonymous codons usage pattern. Apart from this, we can also see in Table 2 that the ENC values of the TTSuV1 coding sequences had less fluctuation, ranging from 54.45 to 58.74, with an average value of 56.46, which indicates that the codon bias of the TTSuV1 genome is stable. In general, the lower ENC value indicates a higher codon usage preference and a higher gene expression level as well. The results show that the codon usage bias of TTSuV1 is lower, and the codon usage pattern is mainly affected by base composition.",

The four strains isolated from Spain were equally spread over both sides of the first axis and partially overlapped with each other. It was obvious that strains from China were distributed over two independent areas and had a significant difference, demonstrating that different strains from the same geographical area showed great differences in their codon usage.

Previous studies have mostly focused on higher organisms and many microorganisms with large genomes, and there are few studies on viruses with small genomes. Relatively, there have been more reports on codon usage in genomes from viruses that are important for human health, such as SARS, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus A and hepatitis viruses. TTSuVs is an emerging zoonotic DNA virus that has seriously threatened the development of the pig-raising industry and has brought about great economic losses worldwide. The virus is commonly present in the host's serum, plasma, semen, milk, feces and other tissues [23] [24] [25] [26] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Although TTSuVs infection occurs in all ages, genders, and varieties of pigs [39, [41] [42] [43] [44] , a definitive pathogenic role of the virus has not been demonstrated. A recent study has shown that TTSuVs is associated with many economically important diseases, such as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) [45] . Krakowka et al. found that TTSuV1 promoted both porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection in gnotobiotic piglets. In addition, TTSuV1 coinfection with PRRSV has been correlated with the development of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PNDS) in gnotobiotic piglets [46] . The codon usage pattern is a genetic characteristic of various organisms. Because C %, U %, C 3 % and U 3 % play an important role in the formation of the different optimal codons ending with any nucleotide, the codon usage pattern of the TTSuV1 coding region is likely to be influenced by composition constraints. Using nucleotide content and RSCU value analysis, we found that the TTSuV1 coding region was GC 3 poor (average value, 49.6 %), and most of the preferentially used codons were A-ended or C-ended codons, and G-ended or U-ended codons were of lower preference. Previous studies have shown that many viruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus, influenza A virus subtype H5N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human bocavirus, preferentially use C-ended or G-ended codons [8, 47, 48] . The overall nucleotide content has an effect on the nucleotide content at the third codon position in TTSuV1, and the overrepresented synonymous codons depending on the RSCU value matched with the results deduced from nucleotide content. This evidence indicates that the overall composition constraints affect the nucleotide content at the third codon position and the codon usage pattern of TTSuV1; that is to say, mutation pressure plays an important role in influencing the TTSuV1 codon usage pattern.",

            "text": "The ENC values calculated for the TTSuV1 coding region indicated that a significantly lower codon usage bias existed in TTSuV1. As a case in point, the ENC values varied from 54.45 to 58.74, with a stable diversification. The average ENC value of 56.46 among TTSuV1 coding genes can be compared to those calculated for other viruses, such as H5N1 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome [13, [48] [49] [50] . Therefore, taken together with published data on codon usage bias in other viruses, we conclude that the codon usage bias in TTSuV1 gene is lower and might be affected by natural selection. The low codon bias of TTSuV1 might result from an increase its own replication efficiency in order to adapt to the replication system of its hosts. It is well established that synonymous codon usage in various organisms often reflects a balance between mutation pressure and natural selection. As for some RNA viruses, previous studies have reported that the major factor in shaping the codon usage pattern appears to be mutation pressure rather than natural selection [51] . Shacklton et al. revealed that codon usage bias was strongly correlated with the overall genomic GC content in DNA virus, suggesting that genome-wide mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main determinant of codon usage bias [35] . However, Naya et al. found that there was no evidence indicating that the genome composition shaped the codon usage bias in high-GC-content genes [52] . In this study, except for mutation pressure, natural selection also played an important role in determining the codon usage bias of TTSuV1, which was supported by the non-correlation (p [ 0.05) between GC 1 %, GC 2 % with GC 3 %, and the results deduced from the ENC plot, in which almost all genes were below the expected curve. In addition, according to the analysis of the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolates from different countries, we found that geographic factors were related to codon usage patterns in TTSuV1. It is interesting to note that TTSuV1 isolates from different countries, and even from the same country, had significant differences in their genetic characteristics. This might suggest that natural selection is a factor that shapes the overall codon usage pattern of this virus and acts as a major force to drive TTSuV1 evolution.",

As for TTSuV1, the results suggest that there has been an interaction of mutation pressure with natural selection in the process of TTSuV1 evolution, although ENC values for the whole TTSuV1 coding region indicate that mutation pressure is one of the factors influencing the codon usage pattern. If synonymous codon usage bias is affected only by mutation pressure, then the frequency of nucleotides A and T should be equal to that of C and G at the synonymous codon third position. However, our study showed that the frequency of A and T was not balanced with C and G at these positions, indicating that other factors such as natural selection could also be the main determinants for synonymous codon usage bias. This characteristic of TTSuV1 conferred adaptive advantages, which resulted in a highly efficient dissemination of the virus by different modes of transmission.",
