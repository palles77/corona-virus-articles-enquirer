            "text": "As humans continue to encroach on previously undisturbed and pristine wild habitats, the frequency of wildlife-human encounters has increased. These increased encounters have led to an increased need for veterinary participation in managing sick and injured animals. For much of the public, veterinarians are still held in reverence because of the James Herriott stories. We believe that it is important for veterinarians to maintain this image. This does not necessarily suggest that veterinarians should consider themselves experts on all animal species, but that as professionals, they should develop an infrastructure of resources that enables them to provide medical and surgical care for those animals in need. In addition, because many of these animals can serve as reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, veterinarians can play an important role in minimizing the risk of disease transmission between wildlife and concerned citizens. For some veterinarians, their role may require them to maintain a current list of veterinarians or wildlife rehabilitators capable of managing an injured wildlife patient and refer clients to these professionals. For others with a more invested interest, it may mean that they will pursue available resources to develop the knowledge and skill for managing these animals in their hospital. The last thing clients, or prospective clients, want to hear from veterinarians is \"We don't work with those animals.\" Instead, if veterinarians can, at a minimum, direct clients to the most appropriate resource, veterinarians maintain (and justify) their image among the professions.",

            "text": "There are many fi nancial, ethical, and emotional issues for veterinarians to consider when deciding whether to accept wildlife cases to their practice. Wildlife is not owned and therefore do not come with paying caretakers. In many cases, the hospital will be expected to absorb the cost of treatment, although avenues for monetary compensation, including grants and public donations, do exist. Accepting wildlife cases is often perceived by (prospective) clients as a positive reinforcement of a veterinarian's compassion toward animals and can serve, directly or indirectly, as a method of increasing a veterinarian's domestic and exotic pet caseload. One ethical consideration to make with these cases is deciding when intervention may interfere with a natural process occurring in a population. In some cases, euthanasia will certainly end suffering, whereas in others treatment may interfere with both natural selection and the disease status in a population. However, because the lives of humans have become so enmeshed with populations of wild animals, it is unavoidable that some, if not most, of the injuries or disease processes occurring in wildlife populations are the direct result of human contact. In these cases, there may be a strong moral (ethical) obligation to repair damage caused by the human species. An early and rational assessment of the likely return to function for a patient is imperative to conserve the available resources for treatment and prevent undue suffering in the patient. Animals who are considered poor candidates for release or placement should be considered for euthanasia as soon as an assessment is made. Release candidates should be able to function appropriately within their natural habitat (including reproduction) and with conspecifi cs; otherwise, a disservice is rendered to both the animal and its population.",

These regulations have been enacted at the federal and state levels to ensure the protection of these animals against individuals that would otherwise exploit them (e.g., meat or fur). Historically, veterinarians were perceived as \"good Samaritans,\" and it was just accepted that veterinarians would or could provide any medical and surgical care that a particular wildlife patient required. Unfortunately, some veterinarians, like many unlicensed wildlife rehabilitators, will attempt to complete the rehabilitation process for their wildlife patients, even though they cannot meet their patient's husbandry, nutritional, or posttreatment rehabilitation needs. Currently, federal and state governments are committed to maintaining veterinarians as an integral component to the care of injured wildlife and consider veterinarians to be the experts for providing medical and surgical care for these animals. However, these agencies also realize that most veterinarians do not have the time or facilities to fully rehabilitate injured wildlife. Because of this, federal and state agencies require veterinarians (without state and/or federal rehabilitation permits) to transfer these animals to licensed rehabilitators to complete the rehabilitation process. It is expected that a veterinarian will transfer any wildlife patient to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator within 24 hours of stabilizing the patient. A stabilized patient is one that is no longer in dire need of veterinary medical care. Patients that require medical treatment that can be administered via an experienced (trained) rehabilitator should be transferred.",

Many veterinarians will limit the types of cases presented to their hospitals. Some of the veterinarians we consult with only accept chelonians, whereas others may accept only avian cases.

Many of these opportunities can be obtained from local or state meetings, although the large national meetings (e.g., the annual conferences of the National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association and the International Wildlife Rehabilitators Association) provide the most diverse training opportunities.

In our opinion, this is the single most controversial issue that can arise in a hospital. If staff members (and veterinarians) become emotionally attached to their cases, they are less likely to maintain an objective outlook on their cases. It is important to always approach these cases with a triage mentality ( Figure  19 -1). The time spent treating these patients should also be limited to necessary contact only. Animals that become habituated to humans in captivity may be at greater risk of reinjury or death after release if they lose their fear of humans. For orphaned animals, imprinting is a major concern. Imprinting occurs when an animal recognizes a human as the \"parent\" animal. Imprinting can potentially lead to dangerous encounters for humans and wildlife, especially with mesopredators, carnivores, and raptors. For this reason, it is important that only trained staff manage orphaned animals.",

The best cage materials to use for housing raptors are those that do not bend or damage the feathers. Because most veterinary hospitals maintain chain-link fence kennels or stainless steel cages, housing for raptors may be limited. Covering the cage with a soft mesh can help diminish the amount of feather damage done to hospitalized raptors. Tailguards made out of old radiograph fi lm can be used to reduce tail feather damage.

Because wildlife can harbor various bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic diseases that can be transmitted to domestic pets, it is important to minimize and restrict both direct and indirect contact between these animals. Wildlife should be housed in a separate room from domestic species. A room with its own ventilation system is preferred. The traffi c through the wildlife ward should be one-way. A foot bath with a disinfectant (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) should be placed outside the doorway and used after exiting the room to minimize the likelihood of tracking infectious diseases throughout the hospital. The disinfectant should be changed daily, or as often as needed, to minimize the amount of organic debris in the solution. Organic debris renders many disinfectants useless. Laboratory coats, or preferably jumpsuits that totally cover clothing, should be placed in the wildlife ward and worn when working with the animals. These clothing materials should be taken out of the room only for washing. Any materials being removed from the ward should be placed in a garbage bag and carried through the hospital in these bags to minimize the likelihood of disseminating disease through the hospital. A hand-washing station should be placed within the room. Signs should be posted on the wildlife ward door to alert staff and clients about the presence of wildlife and the need to maintain a strict quarantine protocol.",

Although birds are endotherms, there are times when the provision of supplemental heat is important. Birds that fl uff their feathers do so to maintain body heat. Birds displaying this behavior must convert energy to maintain their core body temperature. To confi rm this, the animal's body temperature should be taken. Birds naturally maintain a higher body temperature than mammals, with most birds falling between 104\u00b0 F and 108\u00b0 F. Because birds with an illness must conserve energy, it is important that veterinarians provide supplemental heat to minimize the energy expenditure associated with heat conservation. Temperature-controlled incubators provide an excellent method of providing a consistent environmental temperature (Figure 19 -3). Heating pads, hot water bottles, Figure 19 -2 Intubating birds, such as this red-shouldered hawk, is straightforward. Once the glottis is located at the base of the tongue, the endotracheal tube can be inserted. and incandescent lights can also be used to provide supplemental heat, but all should be monitored closely. Adult birds that are hypothermic can be maintained in an environmental temperature of 82\u00b0 F to 88\u00b0 F, whereas juvenile birds may need to be kept warmer depending on the extent of their feather coverage (e.g., nestling vs. fl edgling). Mammals, like birds, are also endothermic, and although they can control their own body temperature, they may require supplemental heat on occasion. Mammals that are hypothermic may shiver, have cold extremities, and have a body temperature below the acceptable reference range. Most mammalian body temperatures are between 100\u00b0 F and 104\u00b0 F. Opossums are an exception, generally having a body temperature between 92\u00b0 F and 96\u00b0 F. Reptiles are ectotherms and depend on their environmental temperature to regulate their core body temperature.

Fluids should always be warmed to the patient's physiologic temperature before being administered. Identifying which fl uid is most appropriate will be based on the type of dehydration. Most wildlife cases present with isotonic dehydration, so a balanced fl uid (e.g., 0.9% saline, lactated Ringer's solution) can be used. Calculating the patient's osmolality is the best method for estimating the type of dehydration. Laboratories using osmometers can calculate this number; however, if submitting a sample is not possible, then an estimate can be made using the following mathematical formula: OsM = 2(sodium + potassium) + urea + glucose. For reptiles and birds, uric acid can be used as a substitute for urea; however, it may underestimate the true osmolality.

Depending on the site and nature of the fracture, various emergency bandaging methods can be employed. We generally immobilize wing fractures with a fi gure-of-eight splint ( Figure 19 -5) or a body wrap. The fi gure-of-eight splint is appropriate for fractures distal to the elbow, and a body wrap is recommended when the fracture includes the humerus. Vet-wrap (3M Corp., St. Paul, MN), or another comparable bandage material, can be used. For small birds (e.g., hummingbirds), placing the wings in a normal position and taping the primaries where they cross can provide an adequate splint. When immobilizing the wings of a bird, it is important to change the bandage and provide physical therapy every 3 to 4 days. This will prevent excessive contraction of the patagial tendon and atrophy of the muscles. We prefer to replace the bandage under anesthesia, as this minimizes the likelihood of the animal reinjuring itself and controls the pain associated with the procedure. In birds, fractures of the legs can be immobilized with modifi ed syringe-case splints, tape splints, a ball bandage, or a Robert Jones-type splint. Syringe case splints are best suited for fractures distal to the stifl e. Tape splints can be used to stabilize toes or the distal leg of a passerine or other lightweight bird. We generally use white, porous tape for these splints. For mammals, limbs can be splinted using the standard techniques described for domestic mammals. Fractures of the reptile limb can be immobilized by taping the limb to the animal's body. In lizards, a forelimb can be secured against the body wall using porous tape while the rear leg can be immobilized against the tail. In chelonians, the limb can be reduced into a normal position within the shell and taped into place.

If necrotic tissue is left behind, it will delay the healing process. Sharp dissection of the wound should be done to remove all of the necrotic tissue. Wound disinfection can be done by irrigating the wound with dilute chlorhexidine, Betadine, or 50% dextrose. We have used the hyperosmotic dextrose, with excellent results. Others report similar results with honey. After disinfection, the wound should be rinsed with a warmed sterile saline.

Bandage material can be applied to the wound if additional protection is required. A wet-to-dry bandage can be applied to any wound that requires decontamination. Depending on the size of the wound, either 2\u2033 \u00d7 2\u2033 or 4\u2033 \u00d7 4\u2033 gauze pads can be used for the bandage.

Any necrotic tissue should be removed in between bandage changes. While uncovered, the wound should be disinfected using the technique described previously. The wet-to-dry bandage should be used only until the wound is considered disinfected. Prolonged use of this bandage can lead to tissue desiccation.",

The techniques vary according to the species being approached, but some generalities apply. If observing the animal before capture, it is best to evaluate its posture and attitude from a distance (e.g., alert, depressed, lethargic). This information can be used to develop a capture strategy. Animals that are depressed and lethargic should be approached cautiously, as they may be more susceptible to sudden death or capture myopathy. When developing a capture strategy, it is also imperative to consider the humans involved with the procedure, to ensure no harm comes to those involved. Before capture, identify the major \"weapons\" an animal will use to defend itself. Raptors, for example, may use their talons and beak as weapons. An appropriate-sized, darkened cardboard box (with ventilation holes cut in) or pet carrier that opens from the top can be used to transport wildlife. The cardboard box is an excellent transport carrier because it can be discarded after use; the pet carrier can be disinfected between uses. Homemade wooden boxes may also be used but are more diffi cult to disinfect. It is important to include a nonslip fl oor covering in the transport container to ensure proper footing in the transport box.

Thick leather gloves, such as welding gloves, should be worn when handling medium to larger-sized specimens. Small raptors may be handled using outdoor work gloves (e.g., cotton or leather). When approached, most raptors roll backward and present their talons. When presented with a bird in this position, it is possible to offer them a towel or blanket to grasp before restraining the legs. The legs should always be grasped as close to the body wall as possible, as this will reduce the likelihood of causing a tibiotarsal fracture or injuries associated with selftaloning. The head of the raptor should be grasped using the same techniques to restrain other birds, with the index fi nger and thumb positioned under the mandible ( Figure 19 -6). For animals that are free-ranging, a bal chatri trap may be used. These traps can be built out of wire mesh (e.g., chicken wire) and fi shing line. The wire mesh is fi rst used to construct a wire cage to hold a live prey species (e.g., pigeon or rodent). A second piece of chicken wire is then placed over the prey cage, thus preventing injury to the prey species. The fi shing line is then cut into small pieces (6-8 cm) and tied into small nooses. These nooses are secured over the entire surface of the trap. When the raptor attacks the trap, it becomes entangled in the trap and cannot lift off the ground with the trap.",

Confi nement and reduction of vision can minimize the stress experienced by the animal. For example, a reptile can be placed into a dark bag for radiographs because they will generally remain motionless for the procedure. Placing a nonocclusive bandage material over the animal's eyes may also be used to reduce motion for a diagnostic procedure such as radiographs.",

The physical examination represents the fi rst opportunity the veterinarian has at determining the likelihood an animal can be rehabilitated and released. In some cases, the injury will be lifethreatening or not correctable, and humane euthanasia will be warranted. In other cases, the ultimate outcome will be based on the veterinarian's ability to provide medical and surgical assistance. For these reasons, it is important that the veterinarian fully evaluate these animals at the time of presentation to ensure that he or she identifi es all of the problems an animal presents with, as well as make a determination as to the value of pursuing or not pursuing a case. The fi rst, and most important, step in performing a physical examination is to correctly identify the presenting species and its age group. For those with limited knowledge regarding species characterization, we recommend maintaining a library of fi eld guides (both national and state) to assist with species identifi cation. Maintaining friendships with local ornithologists, mammalogists, and herpetologists might also be helpful when attempting to identify resources to assist with species identifi cation. The Internet can also be a valuable resource for identifying species too. If the identifi cation of the actual species is not possible, it would still be useful to be able to characterize the animal to family or generic level. Correctly identifying the animal will allow the veterinarian to determine the (1) natural diet (e.g., carnivore, omnivore, herbivore), (2) habitat and feeding strategy (e.g., aerial feeder, arboreal, ground dwelling), (3) social behavior (e.g., gregarious and nonterritorial, solitary and territorial), (4) movements (e.g., resident, partial migrant, summer or winter visitor), (5) approximate age (e.g., dependent/independent juvenile, or adult) (Figure 19-8) , and (6) gender. This information will aid in determining the care an animal should receive and may also determine its release potential. If the animal is being presented from an outside source, a thorough history should be obtained. Unfortunately, the opportunity to obtain a thorough history from these animals is often limited because the individuals presenting the animals may have only recently encountered the animals. Those historical questions that can generally be answered include: (1) Where was the animal found? (2) Under what conditions was the animal found? (3) What day and time was the animal found? (4) How long has the rescuer had the animal? (5) Has the rescuer fed, watered, or medicated the animal? (6) What has the animal been doing while in captivity?

Traumatic injuries frequently result in fractures, soft tissue injury, ruptured air sacs, nervous system damage (e.g., con- cussion, paralysis), and damaged plumage and beaks. Poisonings may be intentional or unintentional (Figure 19-9 ). It is important to attempt to identify the source of the poisoning, if at all possible, to prevent exposure to children, domestic pets, and other wildlife. Rodenticides, insecticides, herbicides, and heavy metals are the most common poisons reported in wildlife. Infectious disease in wild birds may be associated with an individual bird's exposure and immune status, or it may be related to a disease outbreak. Chlamydophila psittaci, poxviruses, mycoplasmosis, and trichomoniasis represent diseases that commonly circulate through wild bird populations, while aspergillosis is more often an individual bird disease that occurs as a result of a single direct exposure or the stress associated with captivity.

Unfortunately, fractures of the humerus or fractures of both the radius and ulna have a guarded to grave prognosis. If healing does occur with these fractures, normal fl ight is often compromised.

These birds rely heavily on fl ight to evade predators and reach roosts and should not be released with impaired fl ight. Euthanasia should be considered for birds with open or comminuted fractures or fractures with extensive joint involvement. Neurologic disorders are commonly seen with traumatic injuries, and the physical examination should include a thorough examination of the animal's posture, demeanor, mentation, and refl exes. Traumatic wounds secondary to strike by raptors usually present as wounds on the bird's dorsum. Ruptured crops are commonly seen in these species, likely because their crops are usually more heavily fi lled than those of other avian species. These cases will present as a necrotic granulating wound and associated crop fi stula. Pigeons and doves are susceptible to a range of infectious diseases. Trichomoniasis commonly causes white plaques in the oral cavity. This organism is extremely contagious in these birds. Mild cases can be simple to treat, but advanced cases carry a poor prognosis. Many of the severe cases show some improvement with treatment, only to succumb before the completion of the treatment and elimination of the signs. For this reason, we generally recommend euthanasia for the severe cases. Bacterial and fungal infections of the crop (ingluvitis) are common, especially in young birds. A foul smell in the oral cavity can be an indication of a crop infection. The crop itself may appear thickened, enlarged, and have a decreased emptying time. Septic arthritis, often the result of infection with Salmonella sp. or E. coli, is common in these birds and may resolve with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; however, some authors advise against treatment because of the chronic joint problems that may arise after treatment and the zoonotic potential for the handlers. 1 Pigeons and doves can serve as reservoirs for pathogens that are highly infectious to other birds, including paramyxovirus (Newcastle disease-a reportable disease) and poxvirus. Pigeons or doves presenting with clinical signs consistent with these diseases should be euthanized to minimize the likelihood of disease transmission to other birds. A bird with a paramyxovirus infection may display a range of clinical signs, including head tremors, diarrhea, deformed eggs, torticollis, polyuria, polydipsia, and anorexia. Birds with pox lesions generally have multiple masses in their featherless areas (e.g., legs and surrounding the oral cavity and eyes). When these lesions are draining, they are contagious to other birds. Mycoplasma spp. infections are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract disease, resulting in swollen sinuses and ocular or nasal discharge. Other than ticks or lice, external parasites are rarely seen. Various species of coccidians can cause wasting and diarrhea.

Gamebirds who have been traumatized may present with orthopedic injuries, ocular hemorrhage, or neurologic disease. Infectious diseases seen in gamebirds include viral disease, bacterial infection, fungal disease, and parasitic disease. Paramyxovirus (Newcastle disease) and pheasant coronavirus, which causes multiple masses around the head and limbs, are the most common viral diseases. These birds are susceptible to a variety of opportunistic bacterial pathogens. Some of the more common pathogens are E. coli, Salmonella sp., and Mycobacterium avium. Birds with E. coli infections generally present in critical condition and often appear hypothermic (fl uffed) and depressed. Salmonella sp. is usually associated with hemorrhagic enteritis, and animals often succumb to this disease acutely. Mycobacteriosis is generally associated with general body wasting, sinusitis, and tenosynovitis. This pathogen is zoonotic, so appropriate precautions should be taken when handling and disposing an animal. Fungal infections with Aspergillus spp. can result from spore inhalation, and affected animals develop clinical signs associated with the respiratory tract, including coughing and dyspnea. The parasitic diseases reported in gamebirds are similar to those seen in pigeons and doves. Capillaria sp. is a common fi nding in both wild and captive gamebirds. This endoparasite can cause severe loss of body condition, and it is not uncommon for animals to succumb to infection. Commonly, gamebirds are semi-intensively farmed before release and may be prone to parasitic infections. A soiled vent and diarrhea are common fi ndings in gamebirds with endoparasitic infections.

Duck viral enteritis, which is caused by a herpesvirus, can result in hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, neurologic abnormalities, polydipsia, and signs associated with all other body systems. Duck plague, Pasteurella multocida infections, can occur in fl ocks at certain times of the year. Avian tuberculosis can also be disseminated through fl ocks that are in close association.",

Falcon and owl herpesvirus infections are occasionally observed in animals with neurologic disease. Raptors are also susceptible to paramyxovirus.

E. coli, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Staphylococcus aureus infections are commonly reported in raptors. Hippoboscid fl ies and lice are commonly found on raptors at the time of presentation. In addition to being exposed to poxvirus with columbiformes, many raptors are also exposed to trichomonads. Affected animals often have large white plaques in the oral cavity. Euthanasia should be considered for any of the following presentations: loss of an eye or reduced vision (owls may be an exception), an inability to feed naturally, loss of the function of one or both wings or legs, damage or amputation of the toes or talons that prevents normal hunting and perching, any bird that has become habituated or imprinted on humans and would be dangerous if released, and inability to relate naturally to conspecifi cs.",

Squirrels commonly present to the veterinary hospital for traumatic injuries (e.g., hit by automobile, gunshot, domestic species predation), poisonings, and infectious diseases. Animals that present for traumatic injuries may have unilateral or bilateral epistaxis, musculoskeletal injuries (e.g., fractures), deep puncture wounds, or degloving injuries, or they may be in shock. A decision as to the long-term potential for releasing the animal should be made at the time of presentation. Although some rehabilitators do not advocate this, at times a decision to not pursue a case in which the species is more plentiful (e.g., squirrel vs. bald eagle) must be made. This is the basis for triage, especially when fi nancial and personnel resources are limited. Most squirrel poisonings are associated with rodenticides or pesticides and are, unfortunately, intentional. It is important to identify and pursue potential poison cases to minimize the risk for poisoning of children, domestic animals, or other wildlife. A poxvirus is occasionally observed in wild squirrel populations. Squirrels are susceptible to West Nile virus infections. Many of the infectious agents recovered from squirrels at the time of presentation are presumed to be related to a bite injury sustained from a predator.

Delivery of the drug into the heart, a blood vessel, or an intraosseous catheter will result in an almost immediate cessation of cardiac function. If the euthanasia solution is delivered into the coelomic cavity, the animal may require 5 to 20 minutes to expire. Additional doses of euthanasia solution can be given if needed. Mammals can also be masked down, although for larger specimens, an injectable anesthetic is generally used (e.g., ketamine). Again, the euthanasia solution can be given intravenously, intracardiacally, intraosseously, or intrathoracically/intraabdominally. It is also recommended that reptiles be preanesthetized before being euthanized. Again, dissociative agents are preferred. Freezing reptiles is not considered an appropriate euthanasia method.",

In the wild, the nest provides an environment that supports the bird with it legs under its body, feet under the chest, and body weight centered in the back, knees, and lower coelomic cavity. The curved sides of the nest give the body this support and allow the nestling to push against the side of the nest for balance while feeding.

The nest should be fi lled with crumpled paper, paper towels, or cloth (e.g., towel, old T-shirt).

Animals that are dehydrated will have decreased gastrointestinal times, which can lead to obstipation or constipation. Avoid physical contact during the feedings whenever possible.

Placing a mirror in front of the animal so that its own refl ection is the only animal it can see may also be done. Feeding intervals for birds should be consistent to promote regular gastrointestinal transit times. If the bird does not gape to be fed, its beak can be gently opened by pressure on the base at each side. The beaks are really delicate, and care must be taken to avoid damaging them. Most baby birds will gape when the nest is slightly disturbed, as this mimics the parent landing on the side of the nest. The bird will usually stop gaping when it is satiated. It is generally diffi cult to overfeed these animals, although there may be some instances when birds will continue to gape with a full crop. Feeding should be discontinued in these birds until their crop is emptied; otherwise, they may develop crop stasis.

For these birds, crop milk provides the sole source of nutrients during the fi rst few days of life and remains the primary food for the fi rst week to 10 days after hatching. Gradually, crop milk is mixed with the adult diet and fed to hatchlings by both adult parents. Crop milk is crucial for the survival of squabs, as they hatch in a relatively undeveloped state. Squabs are unable to use food found in their environment, cannot digest an adult bird's diet, hatch with their eyes unopened, and do not possess feathering for thermoregulation after hatching. The composition of crop milk is similar to that found in mammals; it contains water, fat, protein, and ash. The primary difference between the avian milk and mammalian milk is in the carbohydrate and protein fractions. Pigeon milk is devoid of lactose. It does, however, contain high levels of crude protein and fat. When working with these animals, attempts to mimic this formula should be made. The following formula (for a day's feeding) has been recommended: Mix one hard-boiled egg yolk (mashed), 3 tablespoons mixed baby cereal, 3 tablespoons oatmeal, and 3 tablespoons cornmeal. 13 We have used both a Pigeons and doves also feed differently than other birds. A squab gets its food by thrusting its beak far down either side of its parents' esophagus, where it can have access to the crop milk. Squeakers, or nestling pigeons and doves, will feed the same way but instead take seeds from the parents' crops. To compensate for this feeding technique, we tube the squab or squeaker or cut the tip off of a 1-ml or 3-ml syringe, fi ll the syringe with gruel, and place the beak of the bird in the openended syringe. This technique can be used to simulate the normal strategy of having the beak inserted into the esophagus of the parent bird. Once the beak is inserted into the syringe, the bird will thrust its head and start imbibing the gruel. Squeakers that are free-feeding can be offered water-soaked gamebird chow.",

An electric heating pad or warmed water bottle can provide supplemental heat. A nest substitute can be placed in the enclosure to mimic an animal's natural setting. A small open cardboard box with tissue paper, paper towels, or a cotton blanket will serve as an appropriate nest substitute. A squirrel's eyes open between 19 and 21 days of age. Males and females may need to be separated; sibling penis suckling is common as the penis can be mistaken for a teat. Omnivore (e.g., canine) or carnivore (e.g., feline) milk replacers most closely represent the natural composition of a squirrel's milk. The formula should be made daily, refrigerated between feedings, and warmed to body temperature before each feeding. A small syringe (e.g., 1-ml or 3ml) can be used to nurse the squirrel. For feeding, the animal can either be placed in lateral recumbency or sternal recumbency. We prefer positioning the animals in sternal recumbency. The formula should be delivered at a pace found acceptable to the squirrel, as feeding the animal too quickly can lead to the aspiration of the milk. Neonates should be fed every 2 hours, with a total volume of 3 ml/day. Anogenital stimulation should be performed after each feeding until the squirrel has urinated and defecated. Dehydrated orphans should be fed a balanced electrolyte solution for one or two feedings and gradually introduced to the milk formula over the following three to four feedings. Diarrhea and bloat commonly occur in animals that have reduced or hypermotile gastrointestinal transit times. When these problems occur, the volume of formula should be decreased. 16 Neonates are messy feeders, and excess formula should be cleaned from their face after each feeding with a warm washcloth. After being fed, neonatal squirrels will sleep until their next feeding. Once a squirrel's eyes have been open for about a week (25-28 days old), begin offering formula from a shallow dish (<0.5 inches deep) every other feeding. When a squirrel readily drinks formula from the dish, discontinue syringe feeding. At the same time, begin to offer other natural foods (e.g., nuts and pine cones) and rodent chow. Rodent chow is the preferred food type to offer, as it is a balanced rodent diet. At 2 months of age, the animal should begin to be acclimated for release. Squirrels received during the late fall should be overwintered until the spring, and springborn orphans should be released in the early summer to ensure that they will have the time to develop the skills necessary to survive in the weather.",

Orphaned lagomorphs can be reared on powdered milk replacers (e.g., Esbilac; PetAg, Hampshire, IL) or goat's milk. As milk replacers are a nutritional compromise, handreared lagomorphs need to be fed more than one time per day and the milk replacer should not be dilute beyond a 2 : 1 (formula-to-water) ratio. In captivity, most young lagomorphs will accept two to four feedings a day, depending on their weight, appetite and general condition. The volume consumed per feeding will also vary based on age and general condition, with animals accepting between 2 and 30 ml of milk per feeding. Orphaned rabbits should be weighed daily using an accurate digital scale. The most common problem encountered with these animals is aspiration of the milk replacer and the development of diarrhea. Aspiration can occur when tubing these animals or forcing the fl uids through the tube so fast that they backfl ow up the esophagus and enter the trachea. Affected animals should immediately be given furosemide and broadspectrum antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfadimethoxine). Rabbits that develop enteritis should also be given antibiotics. In the wild, such a problem does not generally occur because of the rabbit's unique physiology. Juvenile rabbits are unusual among mammals in that they naturally have very few microorganisms in their stomach and small intestine while suckling. A natural antimicrobial fatty acid, or \"milk oil,\" is present in the stomach of a suckling rabbit, which is produced by an enzymatic reaction in the doe's milk. 6 This milk oil gives some protection against enteric infection. Orphaned rabbits that are fed a milk replacer do not develop this antimicrobial factor and are therefore susceptible to developing an enteric bacterial infection during nursing.",

Most hand counts are done using the eosinophil unopette technique. The eosinophil unopette method enables the technician or veterinarian to count stained heterophils and eosinophils. Once this count has been done, a differential is read (high dry/oil magnifi cation) using a stained blood-smear slide. Inserting the numbers from the eosinophil unopette estimate and the differential into the following formula will provide an estimated total white blood cell count: (# cells counted) \u00d7 1.1 \u00d7 16/(% heterophils + % eosinophils).

            "text": "Interpreting blood samples from wildlife can be diffi cult, as there are few references. Because of this, one of us (Mitchell) has developed a general set of rules for evaluating hematologic and plasma biochemistry results for wildlife. Regardless of the species, white blood cell counts are generally between 5000 and 15,000 cells/\u03bcl in clinically healthy patients. By establishing a basic range of values, the veterinarian can develop a comfort zone for what is or is not acceptable. It is important, however, to realize that animals with white blood cell counts within this range can be suffering from disease. This would be no different if there was an established \"normal\" reference range for a particular species based on a rigorous study. There can always be abnormal patients within a normal distribution and normal patients that fall out of a mean \u00b12 standard deviations. The way to ultimately determine healthy versus nonhealthy is to evaluate the entire white blood cell count (e.g., differential) and examine the patient. There are two generic reasons that white blood cell counts can be elevated: infl ammation and stress. Many veterinarians want to naturally label the elevation as infection or stress, but this would not be appropriate. If veterinarians always consider a white blood cell count to be associated with an infection, they will miss other potential causes of infl ammation (e.g., trauma, neoplasia, toxins) and overprescribe antibiotics. When interpreting the differential it is important to fi rst identify the predominant cell (neutrophil/heterophil or the lymphocyte). In most species, the heterophil (e.g., reptile, amphibian, avian) or neutrophil (e.g., mammal) will be the predominant cell, whereas within certain groups (e.g., chelonians, deer) the lymphocyte is the predominant cell. In general, the ratio of the predominant cell to the secondary cell will be 1 : 1 to 3 : 1. Therefore, in a clinically healthy raptor the ratio of heterophils to lymphocytes may be as low 1 : 1 or as high as 3 : 1, whereas the inverse may be said for a chelonian. If the ratio is outside of these parameters, the veterinarian must decide if one cell is elevated, the other decreased, or both. Lymphocyte counts in wildlife less than 1500 cells/\u03bcl are consistent with lymphopenia. Monocyte, basophil, and eosinophil counts are generally less than 500 cells/\u03bcl. Monocyte counts between 500-1200 cells/\u03bcl are generally associated with stress, while counts greater than 1200 cells/\u03bcl are strongly suggestive of chronic infl ammation.",

Many wildlife veterinary hospitals utilize radiographs as a parallel component to the physical examination. Survey radiographs are often invaluable for assessing musculoskeletal injuries and the presence of foreign bodies (e.g., fi sh hooks, lead shot) (Figure 19-11) . Radiographs can even be used to characterize infectious disease. For example, raptors with systemic aspergillosis often have an increased radiopacity associated with their air sacs. Those types of radiographic fi ndings direct us to perform coelioscopy. When pursuing radiographs, it is important to always take at least two different images (e.g., lateral and dorsoventral). Attempts to interpret a single radiograph can lead to misclassifi cation. Animals that are fractious should be anesthetized. Any movement during the procedure will result in less than diagnostic images. Ultrasound is generally reserved for mammals and reptiles; it can also be used with birds, but their large bony keel and extensive ribs can limit the amount of imaging that can be done on the viscera. When selecting an ultrasound, it is best to use transducers that are capable of providing the detail needed for the depth of tissue being examined. For example, 7.5-to 12-MHz transducers should be used for small patients (e.g., mink), while 5-to 7.5-MHz units can be used for larger animals (e.g., bear).

The microbiologic cultures collected from wildlife can be processed using the same techniques described for domestic species. More species-specifi c information regarding culture techniques is available in other chapters of this book. It is important for veterinarians to establish a relationship with a microbiology laboratory. The laboratory scientists should be made aware of the different types of patients the veterinarians are working with, as the isolation of certain organisms requires more specialized techniques (e.g., Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella spp.). Interpreting the results of a culture should be done carefully. Just because an organism was isolated from an animal does not necessarily infer that it is causing disease. Cytologic examination or histopathologic testing of a wound that confi rms the presence of a uniform population of organisms consistent with an isolate would certainly lend more strength to the association. Discussing the fi ndings with the laboratory can also be benefi cial. The laboratory may be able to provide insight into the growth and density of the organism on the plate or growth of secondary organisms that might be useful for case management.",

Close inspection of a patient may reveal fl eas, fl ies, mites, ticks, or lice. Confi rmation of the type or types of ectoparasites present on the patient can be made by examining the organism(s) under a light microscope. Veterinarians should always wear gloves when working with wildlife to minimize the likelihood of being infested with these organisms. Animals infested with ectoparasites should be treated with an appropriate antiparasitic. Fipronil can be used to eliminate ectoparasites on reptiles and birds. It is best, however, to be cautious when applying the drug to a species for the fi rst time. This topical spray can be used for mesopredators. Firponil is not recommended for lagomorphs or rodents, as it can be associated with neurologic disease and death. Ivermectin can also be used to control ectoparasites but should never be used with chelonians.",

If the parasite burden does not appear to be associated with clinical disease in the patient, and also does not pose a health risk to the veterinary staff, then treatment may be postponed.

Returning an animal that is fi t but unable to reproduce may displace a normally functioning member of its species in that environment, whether it be through prey, territory, or mate competition. This can have an overall deleterious effect on the population.

Animals kept in captivity for long periods of time or juveniles raised in captivity may have diffi culties in performing some or all of these functions.

Both mental and physical fi tness must be evaluated. The use of a remote monitoring device, such as a closed circuit television, can be very helpful in assessing normal behavior, as many animals will not behave as they would in the wild in the presence of humans. In the absence of such technology, attempts can be made to monitor the animal from a concealed area. It is also imperative to consider any ongoing infectious disease that may pose a threat to the animal or the population into which it is released. Attempts to gradually bring the animal to an acceptable state of fi tness can be made in large aviaries or pens, with techniques that mimic as closely as possible the conditions they will meet on their return to the wild. Conditions that may preclude an animal's return to the wild include, but are not limited to, anything that may prevent normal hunting activity, migration, or avoidance of predation, abnormal feather or fur condition (which also affects their ability to regulate their body temperature), amputation, any cause of restricted mobility, loss of senses commonly used for normal behavior, pelvic fractures (in females) that may predispose them to dystocia, and any animal that is imprinted or improperly socialized to humans or domestic animals.
