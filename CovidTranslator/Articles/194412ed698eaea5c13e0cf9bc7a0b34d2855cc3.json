            "text": "This study was designed to conduct genomic analysis in two steps, such as the overall relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis of the five virus species in the orthomyxoviridae family, and more intensive pattern analysis of the four subtypes of influenza A virus (H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, and H5N1) which were isolated from human population. All the subtypes were categorized by their isolated regions, including Asia, Europe, and Africa, and most of the synonymous codon usage patterns were analyzed by correspondence analysis (CA). As a result, influenza A virus showed the lowest synonymous codon usage bias among the virus species of the orthomyxoviridae family, and influenza B and influenza C virus were followed, while suggesting that influenza A virus might have an advantage in transmitting across the species barrier due to their low codon usage bias. The ENC values of the host-specific HA and NA genes repre-sented their different HA and NA types very well, and this reveals that each influenza A virus subtype uses different codon usage patterns as well as the amino acid compositions. In NP, PA and PB2 genes, most of the virus subtypes showed similar RSCU patterns except for H5N1 and H3N2 (A/HK/1774/1999) subtypes which were suspected to be transmitted across the species barrier, from avian and porcine species to human beings, respectively. This distinguishable synonymous codon usage patterns in non-human origin viruses might be useful in determining the origin of influenza A viruses in genomic levels as well as the serological tests. In this study, all the process, including extracting sequences from GenBank flat file and calculating codon usage values, was conducted by Java codes, and these bioinformatics-related methods may be useful in predicting the evolutionary patterns of pandemic viruses.",

About 6 years later, an outbreak of avian flu virus (H5N1) occurred among poultry in eight other Asian countries, South Korea, China, Japan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Viet Nam. At that time, over 100 million birds died from bird flu or were killed by people in efforts to control the outbreak [3] . This outbreak began in South Korea and then spread to Viet Nam, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, China, Laos, and Indonesia. Among these countries, only Viet Nam and Thailand reported human infections, which resulted in 80% and 66.7% fatality rates, respectively. These rates were much higher than that of the Hong Kong outbreak of 1997 [1] , but the origin of the virus responsible has not yet been identified. On February 2006, European Union authorities held an urgent meeting after the H5N1 avian influenza virus was found in dead swans in Italy, Greece, Slovenia, and Austria. They agreed that Europe would be the next target for H5N1 avian flu in the near future, and the foothold for that pandemic would be Africa. Like other Asian countries where the human infections have occurred, the majority of chickens are kept in and around people's homes in Africa. These environmental conditions would provide more opportunities for H5N1 influenza viruses to contact with human beings [4] . The recent appearance of avian flu in Europe suggests that long-distance spread of the virus is also possible via migratory birds [5] .",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are classified into three groups, such as A, B, and C groups, according to the antigenicity of their internal viral nucleoproteins. Type A viruses cause the worldwide epidemics of the respiratory disease influenza, and both type A and B viruses cause epidemics, when type C viruses cause only minor upper respiratory illness. The primary hosts of influenza A viruses are wild aquatic birds, such as duck, terns and shore birds, and influenza B viruses mainly infect humans, with infections of non-human animals being reported only rarely [6, 7] . Influenza A virus, is a member of the orthomyxoviridae family with a negative-sense single-stranded RNA. Its genome consists of eight different segments, ranging in size from 890 to 2,341 bases [8] . Among the proteins encoded by these segments, two glycoproteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA; segment 4) and neuraminidase (NA; segment 6), play important roles in the immune response. Different subtypes of HA (H1 to H15) and NA (N1 to N9) are found in avian species. The HAs of human viruses bind to the terminal sialic acid of glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors containing a2,6 linkages to galactose, whereas HAs of avian isolates prefer a2,3 linkages. NA is not considered to be as important an antigenic determinant as HA, but NA, like HA, is regarded as a possible restrictive factor for viral growth. The major function of NA is to remove sialic acid from the HA and NA of progeny virus particles, intercellular glycoproteins, and host cell receptors, thus facilitating virus release from infected cells and from intercellular inhibitors [9] [10] [11] . In addition to HA and NA proteins, the three viral polymerase proteins, such as PB1 (polymerase basic protein1), PB2 (polymerase basic protein2), and PA (polymerase) encoded on segment 1, 2, and 3 form an enzyme complex that functions in both transcription and replication. To accomplish the replication process, virus requires that newly synthesized NP (nucleoprotein), which encoded on segment 5, to bind to either negative-strand or positive-strand RNAs that are to be used as template for full-length copying [8] . In this study, we analyzed the HA and NA genes which determine the host specificity, and two genes which form the enzyme complex for transcription and replication, including PA and PB2, as well as NP gene from the four subtypes of influenza A virus which has an important role in the replication process. PB1 gene was not used in this study because there were little or no full-length genomes available for four subtypes of influenza A viruses which infected human population.",

            "text": "Analyses of codon usage patterns have been used by some scientists to determine the origins of species in many fields. Synonymous codons are usually known to encode common amino acids for protein synthesis. These codons are not used randomly, but rather some codons are used more frequently than others [12] [13] [14] . In prokaryotes, such as thermophilic bacteria, highly expressed genes have codon usage patterns that are shifted toward a more restricted set of ''preferred'' synonymous codons compared to the codon usage of other less highly expressed genes within a genome [15] , and codon usage patterns have a tendency to mirror the distribution of tRNA abundances [16, 17] . With respect to virus genomes, Gu et al. [18] reported that the relative synonymous codon usage values in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses were virus-specific and that translational selection and gene length might have no effect on the codon usage pattern in these viruses [19] . Almost all codon usage studies using the correspondence analysis method, however, were conducted in bacteria or higher species and not in virus species.",

For a contingency table with I rows and J columns, the plot produced by correspondence analysis would contain two sets of points: one set of I points corresponding to the rows, and one set of J points corresponding to the columns. The positions of the points would reflect the associations. The RSCU values for 59 codons, as described above, were used, and the correspondence analysis process was performed using the SAS statistical program, version 9.1 [22] . The usual output from a correspondence analysis includes the ''best'' two-dimensional representation of the data, along with the coordinates of the plotted points, and a measure (called the inertia) of the amount of information retained in each dimension [23] . The results provide information similar to that produced by factor analysis techniques and allow one to explore the structure of categorical variables included in the table. Genes or species that are strongly associated as measured by their chi-square distances will lie in a similar direction from the origin [23, 24] . The chi-square distance between two coordinates with the same row or column value, called the Euclidean distance [18, 24] , has important statistical meaning, but there is no significant meaning between the row coordinate and the column coordinate. The SigmaPlot 8.0 program was used to create the graphical correspondence analysis plots using coordinates consisting of the first and second dimensional factors that resulted from the correspondence analysis. The correspondence analysis was performed using both the RSCU values of the species from the orthomyxoviridae family, and of the H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, and H5N1 human subtypes from influenza A viruses (Figures 2, 4) .",

Not only the influenza A, B and C viruses, but also the thogoto and dhori virus in the orthomyxoviridae family were analyzed to compare the overall codon usage patterns with influenza group. The result of the RSCU patterns from five species showed that all the viruses revealed the highest value at \u00d4AGA' codon which encodes arginine (Figure 1 ). The influenza B virus resulted the highest bias in \u00d4AGA' codon usage, and influenza B virus, thogoto virus, influenza A, and dhori virus were followed in descending order, and this RSCU pattern also continued in other synonymous codon groups. If there was no synonymous codon usage bias among the codons which encodes the same amino acid, the RSCU values for those codons would be 1.00. So, the higher RSCU values for each synonymous codon mean the higher codon usage bias in that amino acid. The influenza B virus also revealed the high synonymous codon usage bias in codon groups which encoded glutamine, glycine, and threonine. The influenza A virus, however, showed relatively the lowest codon bias among the three influenza virus group. To determine the bias for each species, we calculated the difference between the RSCU value of each species and the RSCU value of 1.00, and then averaged the differences for each virus group. As a result, the average difference from 1.00 for the influenza A virus group was 0.300, and the average differences for the influenza B and influenza C virus groups were 0.383 and 0.510, respectively. The difference for the influenza A virus group was statistically smaller than that for the influenza C virus group (p < 0.05).

This study was designed to perform genomic analysis in two steps. The overall RSCU patterns analysis of the five virus species in the orthomyxoviridae family was conducted first, and then, four subtypes of influenza A virus which were isolated from human population were analyzed to determine the synonymous codon usage patterns more intensively. Virus species in the orthomyxoviridae family were classified very well by their synonymous codon usage patterns ( Figure 2 ). The influenza A virus group of viruses showed the lowest codon usage bias in the correspondence analysis. Pandemic diseases caused by RNA viruses, including SARS coronavirus and avian influenza A virus, have occurred worldwide during the 21st century. These two pandemic viruses are believed to have originated through the transfer of nonhuman virus species to humans. According to Subbarao and Shaw [2] and Puthavathana et al.

Influenza A viruses usually exhibit antigenic drift by changing their HA and NA types in a population, thereby disturbing the host immune system. Although the most subtypes of influenza A viruses cause minor illness in human beings, they also can lead to severe cases of pneumonia or death, as was the case in the 1918 pandemic of the Spanish flu H1N1 subtype [25] . Antigenic shifts in the influenza A virus population have produced new subtypes associated with influenza epidemics or pandemics, such as those that occurred in 1918 (Spanish flu), 1957 (Asian flu), and 1968 (Hong Kong flu). The antigenic shift that occurred in 1957 involved changes in the structures of both HA and NA (H1N1 fi H2N2), that in 1968 involved only one (H2N2 fi H3N2) [8] . Therefore, we chose to compare the synonymous codon usage patterns in these four subtypes, including H1N1, H2N2, N3N2, and H5N1 subtypes, in this study.",

In NP, PA and PB2 genes, H3N2 subtypes which were isolated from Asia, especially Hong Kong in 1999 showed different patterns with same subtypes from Switzerland and France in 1999 and 1997, respectively. In HA and NA genes of H3N2 subtype from Hong Kong in 1999, however, did not showed this distinct pattern when they were compared with the H3N2 subtypes from European countries (data not shown). According to Gregory et al. [26] who sequenced this H3N2 subtype influenza A virus first, this virus (A/ HK/1774/99) was isolated from 10-month-old girl, and it was antigenically related to early (1968) (1969) (1970) (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) human and swine H3N2 viruses. But unlike other H3N2 human viruses, it was clearly distinguishable from human H3N2 viruses isolated since 1979 and avian H3 viruses, and it was closely related in its genetic characteristics to H3N2 viruses prevalent in pigs in Europe during the 1990s. Pigs usually have the receptors for both human and avian influenza A virus HA glycoprotein, so they may act as an intermediate host in the emergence of novel human subtypes [27] . These distinguishable synonymous codon usage patterns of H3N2 subtype which was isolated from Hong Kong which were resulted in our study also proved this history very well (Figures 3, 4) , and, in addition to the serological tests, this synonymous codon usage analysis might to be a useful method to identify the non-human origin of the virus in genomic levels. Actually, this H3N2 virus (A/HK/1774/99) also showed very similar codon usage patterns with H5N1 subtypes which are suspected to be transmitted from non-human species, avian species on the basis of the dim1 in CA plot ( Figure 4C , D, E).",
