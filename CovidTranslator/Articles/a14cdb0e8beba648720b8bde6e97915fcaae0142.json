We analyzed transmission data from patients (i.e., evacuees, international travelers, and those with locally acquired illness) in countries other than the 3 with continuing Ebola epidemics and quantitatively assessed the outbreak risk from new introductions by using different assumptions for transmission control (i.e., immediate and delayed). Results showed that, even in countries that can quickly limit expected number of transmissions per case to <1, the probability that a single introduction will lead to a substantial number of transmissions is not negligible, particularly if transmission variability is high. Identifying incoming infected travelers before symptom onset can decrease worst-case outbreak sizes more than reducing transmissions from patients with locally acquired cases, but performing both actions can have a synergistic effect.",

This Ebola outbreak is the largest and most widespread since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976 (3) , and the probability of international spread outside of West Africa is not negligible (4) . By late April 2015, the virus had been introduced by 7 infected people traveling during their incubation or symptomatic periods to a country other than Guinea, Sierra Leone, or Liberia. Of these 7 cases, 1 led to an outbreak with 19 transmissions in Nigeria (5,6); 1 led to 2 transmissions in the United States (7, 8) ; 1 led to 7 transmissions in Mali (9,10); and 4 led to no transmissions in Mali (11), Senegal (12) , the United States (13) , and the United Kingdom (14) . Additionally, 20 persons who acquired infection in Africa were transferred to the United States and several European countries for treatment (15) , leading to 1 transmission in Spain (16) .",

Furthermore, how likely it is that an introduced case will lead to a substantial number of transmissions is unclear, even in settings with a quick and vigorous public health response to new outbreaks. Gomes et al. (4) performed simulations of Ebola outbreaks in each of 220 countries by first estimating the risk of Ebola being exported from Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone by international travelers and then simulating a stochastic Ebola transmission model conditioned on an importation. The model incorporated Ebola transmission from infected persons in the community and hospital settings and from recently deceased Ebola patients. Assumptions used in the model were that only community transmissions are relevant outside of Africa and that transmissions occur at rates corresponding to containment measures already in place. Gomes et al. provided no explicitly numerical probabilities of large outbreaks per importation, but their simulations apparently produced <100 cases in each country.",

In this scenario, theory from subcritical branching processes (19) , also known as mortal branching processes (20) , guarantees that an outbreak will eventually die out, although perhaps not before a substantial number of transmissions occur. In the modeling literature, outbreaks that die out on their own have been called minor outbreaks (21) or stuttering chains (22) . Such branching process models have been used to estimate transmission parameters in the context of emerging (22, 23) or reemerging (19) (20) (21) 24) infectious diseases.

The value k = 1 corresponds to a geometric distribution, which arises when the duration of the infectious period varies among infected persons according to an exponential distribution, as is generally assumed by differential equation models; otherwise, the infected persons are homogeneous.

The chance of an outbreak with >100 transmissions is negligible (<0.01%) for k = 10 and k = 1 but rises to \u22480.4% under a high variability assumption of k = 0.1 because of increased likelihood of superspreading. We considered the effect of 2 ways to reduce the risk from those results: decreasing R c to approach the level of control achieved among evacuated patients (30) and eliminating the initial high-average transmission step to reflect preidentification of the initial infected traveler. When R 0 = 3 but R c is decreased to 0.1 (Figure 1 , panel B), the chance of >10 transmissions is 1%-10%. The chance of >100 transmissions is <0.01% for k = 10 and k = 1 and 0.2% with high variability. Assuming that the initial patient is identified and that transmission is controlled (R = 0.3) (Figure 1, panel C) causes a much more substantial decrease in outbreak risk, to a range of 0.04%-1% for >10 transmissions and <0.01% for >100 transmissions, even with high variability. Assuming R = 0.1 for all patients causes >10 transmissions to be very unlikely, with a 0.01% chance even with high variability (Figure 1, panel D) .",

The effect of identifying the initial patient is stronger than the effect of reducing R c , but the combination produces a synergistic effect. For example, at moderate variability (k = 1), the 0.01% worst-case outbreak size when R 0 = 3 and R c = 0.3 (49 total transmissions) is reduced to 73% of that value (36 total transmissions) when R c is reduced to 0.1. The worstcase outbreak size is reduced to 31% (15 total transmissions) when the initial patient is identified. Reducing R c (i.e., postcontrol average number of transmissions per patient) and identifying the initial patient together decrease transmission size to 10% of the worst-case value (5 total transmissions), which is greater than the expected reduction (to 22%) if each intervention was conducted independently. The worst-case risk reduction is greatest under the assumption of high transmission variability (k = 0.1); the 0.01% worst-case outbreak size is reduced from 239 total transmissions to 4% or 10 total transmissions when both intervention assumptions are applied.",

The difference between this result and ours is farther widened because their result includes the possibility of multiple simultaneous introductions caused by a cluster of infected travelers, whereas our results were based on a single introduction. Their worstcase estimate is lower than ours because Rainisch et al. assumed a maximum of 2 additional cases caused by secondary transmission per imported case, whereas our fitted distributions of possible transmissions reach >2, sometimes with substantial probability. For example, in our scenario of a single unidentified traveler's Ebola introduction with R 0 = 3 and subsequent cases transmitting with R c = 0.3 and with moderate transmission variability (k = 1), our model estimates a 50% chance of >2 transmissions occurring after a single introduction.

This situation was seen in countries experiencing introduced cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, for which estimated values of k were \u22480.1 (25) . A recent study (31) produced a similar estimate (k = 0.18; 95% CI 0.10-0.26) when the negative binomial distribution was fitted to data from large Ebola transmission chains in Guinea (32) ; this result suggests that the high variability assumption may be appropriate, but whether or not the assumption of high variability is an appropriate characterization for potential Ebola outbreaks in new countries is unclear. Attempting to estimate k by using transmission data (Table 1 ) produced wide ranges of uncertainty. However, the Ebola case that resulted in 13 transmissions in Nigeria suggests that assuming a low value of k, at least for the delayed control scenario, is justified. In Nigeria, the average number of transmissions from those 13 and all subsequent cases was <0.4. This low average number of transmissions was assisted by health authorities' rapid implementation of control measures (5) . Little evidence exists for high transmission variability from these or other locally acquired or medically evacuated Ebola cases.",

Comparisons of the outbreak size expected to be exceeded after A) 1% of introductions and B) 0.01% of introduction of a single initial case, under different assumptions for the reproductive number R and dispersion parameter k. In all cases, higher transmission variability (lower k) leads to higher worst-case estimates. From the R 0 = 3, R c = 0.3 case, reducing R c to 0.1 for cases after the initial case has less effect than reducing the initial case R 0 to 0.3. Reducing both the initial and subsequent cases' R to 0.1 has a synergistic effect.",
