However, students may be choosing not to study science and dismissing the possibility of a scientific career because, in the junior secondary years, they gain a false view of science and the work of scientists. There is a disparity between science as it is portrayed at school and science as it is practiced. This paper describes a study to explore whether engaging in science through astrobiology outreach activities may improve students' understanding of the nature and processes of science, and how this may influence their interest in a career in science. The results suggest that the students attending these Mars research-related outreach activities are more interested in science than the average student but are lacking in understanding of aspects of the nature of science. A significant difference was detected between pre-and posttest understandings of some concepts of the nature of science.",

Astrobiology is a relatively new field of study, so it is not an area that many teachers would have encountered during their training. This, in itself, reflects one aspect of the nature of science-that science is continually evolving and that scientific research is constantly increasing our knowledge and understanding of the natural world. By providing a context for students to witness cutting-edge science or science in the making, astrobiology outreach programs engage students' interest and give them an insight into how science is actually done.",

            "text": "This study examines the effects of two programs: the Pathways to Space program at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, and the Mission to Mars program at the Victorian Space Science Education Centre, Melbourne. The programs incorporate aspects of contemporary science practice and demonstrate to students many aspects of the nature and processes of science that may not be apparent in school science activities including inquiry-based learning. These aspects include characteristics of scientific inquiry; the role, status, and characteristics of the scientific knowledge it generates; how scientists deal with uncertainty; how scientists work as a social group; and how science impacts, and is impacted by, the social context in which it is located (Osborne et al., 2003; Clough, 2006; Wong et al., 2009) . Because astrobiology is multidisciplinary, it is applicable to many strands of school science syllabi and exemplifies for students the interrelationship between science disciplines. These two programs have a similar goal of engaging students in the process of science, but differ in methodology. In the case of Pathways, the ultimate goal is to identify and encourage students who are interested in space-related courses and careers, and it is part of an effort to provide future skills for an emerging Australian space program. Pathways includes a 140-square-meter scientifically accurate Mars Yard and robotics lab in the public space of the Powerhouse Museum, and it also serves as a ''living lab'' in which Mars robotics and science research are undertaken and undergraduate and doctoral students undertake research projects. The high school education program element is integrated into the robotics and science research aspect of the project. In a 1-day program, the high school students use Thinkspace-the museum's digital learning studio-to plan a rover mission to Mars and then execute it in the Mars Yard assisted by a university robotics research engineer. They also consider the evidence for the origins of life on Earth and the relationship to looking for the geological and environmental evidence for the possibility of past or present life on Mars. Students who subsequently ''self-identify'' as being interested in further exposure to the project are offered the opportunity to undertake a NASA student research project run by the Mars Education team at Arizona State University in conjunction with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Mars Student Imaging Program takes 5 weeks to a year to complete depending on mode of delivery, the first program of which is nearing completion at the Powerhouse.",

For example, in Pathways to Space, the students use their imagination and creativity to plan their mission within the engineering constraints. In Mission to Mars, students must come up with creative solutions to the simulated problems they encounter on their mission.

A Royal Society survey (The Royal Society, 2006) of people in science careers found that 63% had started thinking about a career in science before the age of 14. A US study (Tai et al., 2006) suggests that by the time students reach the age of 14 they have already decided whether to continue their study of science. The research reveals that those pupils who show an interest in pursuing a science career before the age of 14 are 3.4 times more likely to complete a science degree than students who have expressed an interest in a nonscience career. An analysis by Maltese and Tai (2009) of interviews with graduate students and scientists regarding their earliest interest in science showed that the majority (65%) reported that their interest in science began before the end of primary school. However, Lyons and Quinn's Choosing Science study (2010) suggests that primary school is not the influencing factor but student experiences in science in Years (Grades) 9 and 10.",

Lyons and Quinn noted the significance of identity in students' decision making about science and the importance of providing students with authentic and relatable images of scientists and the work they do. The Relevance of Science Education (ROSE) project (Schreiner and Sjoberg, 2007) surveyed 15-year-olds from approximately 40 countries about their interest and intentions with regard to science. The data suggested that science did not fit with the identities of many of these students, particularly the girls. The students surveyed in the ROSE study viewed a career in science as incompatible with their values such as self-realization and creativity. To attract students to science careers, Schreiner and Sjoberg considered it important to make them aware of these values in school science and the work of scientists. Others have also noted the importance of not teaching science subjects in isolation and of recognizing the importance of creativity and design in science (Hoachlander and Yanofsky, 2011; Universities Australia, 2012) .",

An understanding of the ''Nature of Science'' is mandated in most science curricula (Tytler, 2007; Schwartz and Lederman, 2008) , and although there is academic debate about the definition of the term, there is general agreement about what it entails at the school level (Osborne et al., 2003; Lederman, 2007) , where it can be broadly described as an understanding of the practice of science or the way that science works. Science as a creative endeavor is an accepted characteristic of science included in Nature of Science literature (Osborne et al., 2003; Lederman, 2007) . There is a large body of research showing that school students' understanding of the Nature of Science is generally poor (Lederman, 2007; Deng et al., 2011) .

(2010) found that high school students perceive creativity and science as essentially opposite and scientific careers to be less creative than other career choices. Although Beghetto (2007) demonstrated a strong positive relationship between high school students' perceived science competence and their perceptions of their ability to generate creative ideas (i.e., creative self-efficacy), students do not make that connection for themselves. Students' perception of a mismatch between the culture of science and their self-image has been investigated by Kessels and Taconis (2011) . They found that it was more important for students choosing to study science at a university to identify with the perceived culture of the field than it was for students choosing other fields of study. They found also that a student's image of science culture is often based on his or her image of a typical science teacher. Science teachers were generally perceived as having more negative traits than other teachers, and fewer students identified with them. So students appear to make decisions about whether they will ''fit'' a career in science based on a largely negative stereotype.",

A recent report by the United States National Research Council (National Research Council, 2012) acknowledges that students currently have too little opportunity to experience how science is actually done. The report recommends emphasizing the cross-disciplinary nature of science and integrating the principles and practices that scientists follow in their work into the science curriculum. In the United Kingdom, the House of Commons has recently published a report concluding that ''field trips are essential contributors to good quality science education'' (UK Parliament, 2011) and recommending the expansion of good quality enhancement and enrichment activity programs. Although there is a view that these types of programs do benefit students, there is little evidence to support this (Braund and Reiss, 2006; Tytler et al., 2008; Department of Innovation Industry Science and Research, 2010) . A 2008 NASA report found that the agency still, after more than half a century of elementary and secondary education and outreach, had no evaluation plan in understanding the effectiveness of these programs (Quinn et al., 2008) .",

Also, as may be expected, the students' understandings and attitudes tend to be reasonably positive, resulting in measures that are negatively skewed and data that is not normally distributed. It has been argued that parametric statistics should not be applied to data with non-normal distributions. For these reasons, both parametric and nonparametric methods of data analysis were used in this study, and the findings of both are reported. It should be noted that both instruments from which the current survey was adapted (Barmby et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2008) used parametric methods of data analysis, as did other researchers who used similarly derived instruments (Lyons and Quinn, 2010; Miller et al., 2010; Shim et al., 2010; Sjoberg and Schreiner, 2010;  Golabek and Amrane-Cooper, 2011).",

The dotted line indicates the ''Not sure'' point (3), with means above this indicating increasing agreement. The error bars indicate two standard errors above and below the mean value, which corresponds approximately to a 95% confidence interval. From Fig. 1 it can be seen that Importance of science has the highest mean values, showing that the students generally agree that science is important. The lowest mean values, for Future participation in science, show that the students generally have a negative attitude to any future science study. The students do not view science more negatively than other school subjects, as shown by a comparison of the mean values of the Learning science in school and Attitude to school subscales.",

On the Attitudes to Science scale the response reflects the relative strength of each attitude. However, according to the coding frame applied to the Nature of Science scale, the response indicates the degree of understanding of each concept. So a response of Agree or Strongly Agree would indicate understanding, while a response of Strongly Disagree, Disagree, or Uncertain would indicate lack of understanding. Figure 7 shows the percentage of students demonstrating understanding of each concept on the Nature of Science scale when pre-and post-visit responses were conflated in this way. On the pre-visit survey only 30% of students thought that imagination and creativity played a part in science, and less than half the students thought that social and cultural values influence the work of scientists. Despite a statistically significant increase from pre-to postvisit scores, the percentage of students showing understanding of these two concepts on the post-visit survey remained below 50%. The third most common area of misunderstanding concerned the methodology of scientific investigations, indicating a fairly common belief in a rigid, prescribed scientific method. By looking at the percentage of students showing understanding of each concept, it can be seen that the concept which showed a significantly significant decrease in scores from pre-to post-visit, Observations and Inferences, in fact shows that the level of understanding fell by only 1%. On the pre-visit survey, 64.4% of students understood that observations are open to multiple valid interpretations, compared with 63.4% post-visit. In order to examine the association between possible predictor variables and students' responses to the item ''I would like to be a scientist when I leave school,'' stepwise linear regression analysis was carried out on the pre-visit data. As shown in Table 4 , of all the Nature of Science and Attitudes to Science constructs, two had standardized regression coefficients that were significant at the 95% confidence level. The construct that contributed most was the Science outside of school construct (beta = 0.37), followed by the Imagination and Creativity in Scientific Investigations construct (beta = 0.13).",

The students in this study had a greater understanding of the role of imagination and creativity in science and of social and cultural influences on science after they had participated in an outreach activity. This was confirmed by parametric and nonparametric tests. This result was unexpected, as a similar 1-day-long intervention conducted in 2008 did not reveal any change in student views (Oliver, 2008) . A comprehensive review of the research on students' views of the Nature of Science (Deng et al., 2011) , although finding mixed results for short-term interventions, did show that the overwhelming majority of effective interventions involved inquiry activities.",

Although a significant difference was detected between pre-and post-visit understandings about imagination and creativity and social and cultural influences in science, more longitudinal studies are required to determine whether FIG. 8. Frequencies of students' pre-visit responses to ''I would like to study more science in the future.'' better understanding of science practice translates into students choosing careers in science. It would also be interesting to be able to measure the effect of the outreach activities on less-interested science students. Research studies are continuing on the Pathways to Space program. There have been recommendations for the science community to provide outreach activities for school students in order to increase their understanding of science practice and perhaps stimulate their interest in a science career (Rennie, 2006; Tytler, 2007; Lyons and Quinn, 2010) . However, the outreach activities that are available are often not effectively evaluated. This study provides evidence that astrobiology outreach can give students the opportunity to experience the way that science is actually done and the multidisciplinary nature of much contemporary science, both of which are increasingly being seen as important to good-quality science education. It also shows that outreach activities can generate meaningful data to gauge their effectiveness and adds to the understanding of how to build better projects in the future. This has wider application at a time when there is international agreement that such opportunities to engage with contemporary science practice are an essential part of science education.",
