            "text": "Toona sinensis is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southeastern Asia that has important culinary and cultural values. To expand current knowledge of the transcriptome and functional genomics in this species, a de novo transcriptome sequence analysis of young and mature leaf tissues of T. sinensis was performed using the Illumina platform. Over 8.1 Gb of data were generated, assembled into 64,541 unigenes, and annotated with known biological functions. Proteins involved in primary metabolite biosynthesis were identified based on similarities to known proteins, including some related to biosynthesis of carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, and energy. Analysis of unigenes differentially expressed between young and mature leaves (transcriptomic libraries 'YL' and 'ML', respectively) showed that the KEGG pathways of phenylpropanoid, naringenin, lignin, cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis were significantly enriched in mature leaves. These results not only expand knowledge of transcriptome characteristics for this valuable species, but also provide a useful transcriptomic dataset to accelerate the researches on its metabolic mechanisms and functional genomics. This study can also further the understanding of unique aromatic metabolism and Chinese medicinal properties of T. sinensis.",

Cedrela sinensis, family Meliaceae) is a perennial woody tree that grows 25 m high, and is used as a source of food, timber, and medicine, particularly in the Anhui province of China. Regarded as nutritious food, the edible buds and young leaves are commonly used to make the condiment Toona Paste, which has a floral and onion-like flavor (Park et al. 1996; Edmonds and Staniforth 1998) . The unique flavor results from various natural compounds including triterpenes, phenolics, flavonoids, and lysine amino acid (Mu et al. 2007; Zhou et al. 2011; Kakumu et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015) . The mature, fibrous leaves of T. sinensis are used in Chinese traditional medicines to treat conditions ranging from diarrhea and other intestinal complaints to reproductive concerns and cancer. Recently, other biological properties of T. sinensis leaf extracts have been reported, including antiinflammatory, analgesic, inhibition of boil growth inhibition, antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-neoplastic, as well as anti-atherosclerotic, and inhibition of replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (Hsu et al. 2003; Chia et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2013 Yang et al. , 2014 You et al. 2013) .",

First, BLASTx and BlastN (both with parameters of match length \u2265 90 bp, e value < 1e\u22125, and the allowance of \u2264 1 mismatch and 1 gap, and identity \u2265 90%) were used to align unigenes to protein databases and Nt, respectively. Subsequently, EST-Scan software was used to determine sequence direction. Then Blast2GO was employed to determine GO annotation against the GO database for unigenes annotated by NCBI Nr (nonredundant protein sequences) (Conesa et al. 2005; G\u00f6tz et al. 2008) . InterProScan (v5) was used to give further protein annotation. Prediction of protein-coding regions was performed with OrfPredictor software (Min et al. 2005) . Additionally, GO functional classification of all unigenes was performed using the Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot (WEGO) software (Ye et al. 2006) , which visualizes and characterizes gene functions and distributions across different pathways.",
