We then show how the same theory can be used to analyze stochastic SIR models with random and proportionate mixing. The epidemic percolation networks for these models are purely directed because undirected edges disappear in the limit of a large population. In a series of simulations, we show that epidemic percolation networks accurately predict the mean outbreak size and probability and final size of an epidemic for a variety of epidemic models in homogeneous and heterogeneous populations. Finally, we show that epidemic percolation networks can be used to re-derive classical results from several different areas of infectious disease epidemiology. In an appendix, we show that an epidemic percolation network can be defined for any time-homogeneous stochastic SIR model in a closed population and prove that the distribution of outbreak sizes given the infection of any given node in the SIR model is identical to the distribution of its out-component sizes in the corresponding probability space of epidemic percolation networks. We conclude that the theory of percolation on semi-directed networks provides a very general framework for the analysis of stochastic SIR models in closed populations.",

The probability of each network is determined by the underlying SIR model. The epidemic percolation network is very similar to the locally dependent random graph defined by Kuulasmaa [6] for an epidemic on a d-dimensional lattice, with two important differences: First, the underlying structure of the contact network is not assumed to be a lattice. Second, we replace pairs of (occupied) directed edges between two nodes with a single undirected edge. The idea of the epidemic percolation network is also similar to the idea of forward and backward branching processes, which have been used to derive the probability and final size of an epidemic, respectively, in SIR models with independent infectiousness and susceptibility [7] . The epidemic percolation network can be thought of as a simultaneous mapping of the forward and backward branching processes that generalizes to models with arbitrary joint distributions of infectiousness and susceptibility. (The relationship between epidemic percolation networks and branching processes is discussed further in Section 5.1.)",

For any set of imported infections, the probability of an epidemic is equal to the probability that at least one imported infection occurs in the GIN. For any finite set of imported infections, the relative final size of an epidemic is asymptotically equal to the proportion of the network contained in the GOUT.

Figures 5 and 6 compare the epidemic percolation network and branching process predictions of the probability and final size of an epidemic. These models have a positive correlation between infectiousness and susceptibility, so persons infected through indigenous transmission are more infectious than persons randomly selected from the population. Since the branching process approximation implicitly assumes that persons infected through indigenous transmission have the same outdegree distribution as the general population, it consistently underestimates both the probability and final size of an epidemic. The epidemic percolation network consistently predicts the correct probability and final size of an epidemic.

We showed that epidemic percolation networks with independent indegree and outdegree are equivalent to forward and backward branching processes, and we used epidemic percolation networks to re-derive classical results from sexually transmitted diseases, vector-borne diseases, and controlled diseases. Epidemic percolation networks may also provide a novel and useful qualitative insight into the control of epidemics. The emergence of epidemics corresponds to the emergence of the GSCC in the epidemic percolation network, so nodes with a high probability of being in the GSCC may be important targets for interventions designed to reduce the probability and final size of an epidemic.",

Models were run on Berkeley Madonna 8.0.1 (\u00a9 1997-2000 Robert I. Macey & George F. Oster) and Mathematica 5.0.0.0 (\u00a9 1988-2003 Wolfram Research, Inc.). All simulations began with a single imported infection randomly chosen from the population. Simulations in Berkeley Madonna used a Poisson approximation to the number of new infections in each time step dt, with dt = .005. Simulations in Mathematica were based on thegeneral stochastic SIR model from the Appendix: A recovery time for each infected individual was sampled from the appropriate distribution. When person i was infected, an infectious contact interval for each ordered pair ij, j \u2260 i, was sampled from the appropriate distribution, and the corresponding infectious contact times were calculated. The minimum infectious contact time for each susceptible individual was stored. The next infection occurred in the susceptible with the smallest infectious contact time.
