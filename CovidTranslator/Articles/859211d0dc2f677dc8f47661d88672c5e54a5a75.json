An estimated 71.8 % of zoonotic EID events are caused by pathogens in wildlife and the incidence of such diseases is increasing significantly in humans. In addition, human diseases are starting to infect wildlife, especially non-human primates. The chimpanzee is an endangered species that is threatened by human activity such as deforestation, poaching, and human disease transmission. Recently, several respiratory disease outbreaks that are suspected of having been transmitted by humans have been reported in wild chimpanzees. Therefore, we need to study zoonotic pathogens that can threaten captive chimpanzees in primate research institutes. Serological surveillance is one of several methods used to reveal infection history. We examined serum from 14 captive chimpanzees in Japanese primate research institutes for antibodies against 62 human pathogens and 1 chimpanzeeborne infectious disease. Antibodies tested positive against 29 pathogens at high or low prevalence in the chimpanzees. These results suggest that the proportions of human-borne infections may reflect the chimpanzee's history, management system in the institute, or regional epidemics. Furthermore, captive chimpanzees are highly susceptible to human pathogens, and their induced antibodies reveal not only their history of infection, but also the possibility of protection against human pathogens.",

Such diseases often reduce wildlife populations in isolated communities (e.g., an Ebola outbreak in gorillas and chimpanzees in Gabon and Congo), increasing their probability of extinction, especially in frequencydependent outbreaks (De Castro and Bolker 2005; Gerber et al. 2005; Bermejo et al. 2006; Nunn et al. 2008) . Most EID events have been caused by zoonotic pathogens from a non-human animal source (Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005; Jones et al. 2008) . Moreover, it is estimated that 71.8 % of such zoonotic events are caused by pathogens that originate in wildlife, for example the emergence of Nipah virus in Perak, Malaysia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong Province, China. Pathogens originating from wildlife have also increased significantly with time (Jones et al. 2008 ). This supports the suggestion that zoonotic EIDs are an increasing, very significant, threat to global health (Morens et al. 2004; Weiss and McMichael 2004; King et al. 2006) . It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the factors that increase contact between wildlife and humans for developing predictive approaches to disease emergence (Daszak et al. 2000; Patz et al. 2004) .",

            "text": "Human infectious diseases are also being increasingly transmitted to wildlife, especially non-human primates. Chimpanzees and humans are closely related species evolutionarily and genetically, not only in their anatomical and physiological characteristics but also in their immunological features, which are much more similar than those between other animals (Brack 1987; Woodford et al. 2002; Clark et al. 2003) . Wild chimpanzees may be susceptible to human infectious diseases because their immune system is na\u00efve to them, so they may not be protected against human pathogens. According to recent reports, in addition to poaching and habitat fragmentation by deforestation, human-borne disease epidemics spread by ecotourism have contributed to the decline in wild chimpanzee populations (Kaiser 2003; Whitfield 2003; Kondgen et al. 2008) . Unknown respiratory diseases have also been reported in other chimpanzees residing in protected areas, including Bossou, Guinea, and Gombe and Mahale, Tanzania; these have resulted in chimpanzee deaths and are suspected of having been transmitted by humans (Goodall 1986; Hosaka 1995; Ferber 2000; Nishida et al. 2003; Matsuzawa et al. 2004; Hanamura et al. 2008) . Infectious disease transmission is possible without close contact via sneezing, coughing, etc. Muehlenbein and Ancrenaz (2009) reported that 39 species of pathogens were recovered from throat swabs of tourists viewing orang-utans, revealing the possibility that many human-borne agents may be transmitted to apes by several modes of infection. Therefore, continuous health monitoring and investigation of human-borne infectious diseases in apes is needed for risk management.",

Information about the chimpanzees is summarised in Table 1 . The chimpanzees had been subjects for behavioural, psychological, and evolutionary studies. As summarised in Table 1 , Pendesa suffered from allergic dermatitis, Mari and Reiko had severe colds in 1984 and 1980, respectively, and Reo developed tetraparesis resembling acute transverse myelitis in 2006 (Miyabe-Nishiwaki et al. 2010) . Pal, Cleo, Ayumu, Pan, Reo, and Popo were born at KUPRI; Pendesa was born in another institution in Japan and transferred to KUPRI when she was 2 years old. Mari and Akira were born in Africa and reared at other institutes in Japan, then transferred to KUPRI; Chloe was born in a French Zoo; Puchi and Gon were born in Africa and reared as pets in Japan; Ai and Reiko were transported directly from Africa. The health of each animal was monitored daily by their keepers, and each individual underwent a periodic health examination every 1-2 years. None of these chimpanzees had been vaccinated against any pathogens.",

This study found fewer positive pathogens than in a study of US primate centres conducted by Kalter and Heberling (1971) more than 30 years ago. This may be because the infectious agents had been removed from the chimpanzee environment with improved knowledge about infectious diseases, and antibody titres of chimpanzees had been reduced to undetectable levels over time.",

On the basis of their high antibody titres the chimpanzees at KUPRI may have been infected recently and may have developed immunity against pertussis.

In humans, PIV-3 and the paramyxoviruses hMPV and RSV cause severe diseases of childhood and mild diseases of adults, who have acquired immunity after repeated infection in the process of growing. Therefore, the high prevalence of these viruses in chimpanzees may indicate that KUPRI chimpanzees have developed, or are developing, immunity against PIV-3, hMPV, and RSV. Increasing antibody prevalence with age was similar to that in humans with PIV-3 and hMPV. RSV and hMPV outbreaks in wild chimpanzees have, however, been causes of death or severe diseases (Kaur et al. 2008; Kondgen et al. 2008) .

In this study 100 % of the chimpanzees were positive for EBV, CMV, and VZV and 75 % were positive for HHV-6, but no antibodies against HSV-1 or 2 were found (Supplementary Table S1 ). In humans, antibody prevalence against herpesviruses increase with age, with acquisition of immunity; hence, antibody prevalence against CMV is similar to that in humans. Repeat reactivation of the other herpesviruses, EBV, VZV, and HHV-6, may occur in the host animals, or human herpesviruses may be transmitted by chimpanzees in KUPRI. Human VZV infection has been reported in chimpanzees; the affected chimpanzees had a mild skin rash over the entire body (Cohen et al. 1996) . In humans, VZV infection sometimes causes herpes zoster, which is thought to be triggered by stress or weak immunity. A case of severe haemorrhagic symptoms as a result of reactivation of its original VZV (simian varicella virus) has been reported in a cynomolgus monkey (Takasaka et al. 1990 ). However, although all of the KUPRI chimpanzees had the antibodies, the chimpanzees never developed symptoms. The original great ape VZV has not been identified, but the high incidence of infection may indicate the existence of a VZVrelated virus. HSV is a common virus not only in humans but also in other primates. However, no transmission has been observed in KUPRI chimpanzees.",

We successfully detected chimpanzee antibodies against human pathogens by use of commercial tests developed for humans. This should facilitate routine monitoring and surveillance of captive chimpanzees. We will continue serological examinations to analyse antibody levels and other respiratory pathogens. Furthermore, our data are limited to one institute, and more information should be gathered that will be useful for great ape conservation. In this study, we performed one-point serological surveillance, which provides only the history of each chimpanzee.

Captive chimpanzees might have more opportunity to be exposed to human pathogens compared with wild populations, but their environment and diet might not be as harsh as in the wild, which could alter the incidence and effects of the same pathogens in captive and wild populations. In addition, captive chimpanzees are at risk of new infectious diseases to which they have never been exposed and against which they have not established immunity. Consequently, monitoring results should be analysed carefully at each research institute or zoo, and care should be taken with all pathogens, including those to which chimpanzees are highly susceptible and those for which only a few or no chimpanzees were seropositive. Ultimately, without direct surveillance of wild populations, we cannot elucidate the prevalence of human-borne infectious diseases in the wild, but our data may still be used as a model. Our data suggest that a means of detecting antibodies in faeces should be developed to facilitate further studies in the wild.",

Furthermore, its effectiveness has been reported in one case of intervention (Robbins et al. 2011 ). This study shows that groups of chimpanzees under captive conditions produced specific antibodies against human diseases and that the chimpanzees were probably protected by their acquired immunity. Therefore, pre-immunity probably effectively protects wild chimpanzees from the human infectious diseases that tourists or researchers unknowingly transmit. However, the vaccination campaign needs careful consideration in terms of negative side effects for wild chimpanzees and nature. Recently, Ryan and Walsh (2011) reviewed the positives and negatives of the intervention and described the available vaccines against human pathogens.",
