            "text": "We performed a comprehensive analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses in dual-virus infected pigs to understand whether a pre-existing immunomodulatory respiratory viral infection affects the overall immunity to a subsequent porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) infection in pigs. Pigs were either mock-infected or infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a virus known to cause immunosuppressive respiratory disease, and then pigs were co-infected with PRCV, which normally causes subclinical respiratory infection. We collected samples for six independent experiments from 178 pigs that were also used for pathological studies. We detected a significant reduction in innate NK-cell-mediated cytotoxic function in PRRSV-infected pigs, which was synergistically further decreased in pigs co-infected with PRCV. Subsequently, in association with clinical signs we observed elevated levels of proinflammatory (IL-6), Th-1 (IL-12), and regulatory (IL-10 and TGF-b) cytokines. Increased frequencies of CD4CD8 double-positive T lymphocytes and myeloid cells, in addition to the elevated Th-1 and proinflammatory cytokines in dual-infected pigs, contributed to the severity of lung disease in pigs. The results of our study clarify how each virus modulates the host innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to inflammatory reactions and lung pathology. Thus measurements of cytokines and frequencies of immune cells may serve as indicators of the progression of respiratory viral coinfections, and provide more definitive approaches for treatment.",

They are potent immunomodulatory molecules that act as mediators of inflammation and the immune response. Proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) are produced early in viral infection, triggering the production of the Th-1 cytokines (IFN-g and IL-2) involved in cellular immune responses. Both IL-10 and TGF-b suppress the host's cell-mediated immune response by reducing cell recruitment and downregulation of cytokine production by innate immune cells (14) . Natural killer (NK) cells are populations of lymphocytes recognized for their ability to provide a first line of innate defense against viral pathogens (8) . Pigs possess relatively more NK cells (up to 10% of lymphocytes) than other species of animals and humans (16) .",

            "text": "We used a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection to understand how immune modulation induced by a prior respiratory viral pathogen influences a subsequent porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) respiratory infection. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales (34, 38) . They are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positivesense RNA. The coronaviruses infect a broad range of vertebrates and cause a variety of disorders, including gastroenteritis and respiratory tract disease. In this study we used PRCV, a deletion mutant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of pigs (44) . PRCV alone causes mostly subclinical respiratory tract infection in pigs, but in conjunction with other viral or bacterial infections, it causes severe respiratory disease in swine (44) . PRCV replicates in epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa and lung (13, 15, 32) . PRRSV is an enveloped RNA virus and a member of the family Arteriviridae and the order Nidovirales (28) . PRRSV has a specific tropism for macrophages in the lung and other tissues (7, 17, 35) , and infected pigs have weak and delayed adaptive immune responses, as suggested by low levels and deferred generation of IFN-g-secreting cells (27) . PRRSV is a strong inducer of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 in the lungs (40) . The IL-10 is produced by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocytes, which are also important targets of IL-10 (23) . Overall, the immune responses against PRRSV are ineffective in resolving the infection completely, and they induce immune modulation, resulting in prolonged viremia and persistent infection in lung and lymphoid tissues, potentiating the effects of other swine pathogens (31) .",

In another study, the cytokine analysis of PRRSV, PRCV, and SIV single-virus infected pigs revealed that changes in proinflammatory cytokine levels are associative, and do not demonstrably cause viral respiratory disease in pigs (43, 44) . Suppressed innate immune responses to TGEV infection in pigs were associated with a reduced NK-cell response (35) . However, comprehensive immunological responses to cytokines in systemic and local mucosal sites of lungs, and lymphoid and myeloid cell populations in the dual respiratory virus-infected pigs were unexplored. The aim of our study was to understand how viral co-infections modulate innate and adaptive immune responses, and how these responses relate to the clinical outcome in pigs.",

In brief, the target cell line, K-562 (human myeloblastoid leukemia cell line), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with FBS. The PBMCs isolated from mock-infected and virus-infected pigs were used as effectors (source of NK cells). The cells were washed three times using medium-199 containing HEPES buffer, gentamicin, and bovine serum albumin (assay medium), to remove free lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and then the cells were resuspended in assay medium. The effectors were transferred to a 96-well round-bottom plate and twofold dilutions were performed. Fixed numbers of target cells were added to attain different effector:target cell ratios. Appropriate controls were included in each plate, such as: only targets; lysed only targets; only effectors; and medium control. The plates were incubated at 378C in a CO 2 incubator overnight. Control target cells were lysed with 2% Triton-X 100 for 15 min. All the plates were centrifuged briefly, and 100 mL of the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 96-well flat-bottom plate, and then equal amounts of LDH substrate [5.4\u00c210 \u00c02 M L(\u00fe) lactic acid, 6.6\u00c210 \u00c04 M 2-p-idophenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl tetrazolium chloride, 2.8\u00c210 \u00c04 M phenazine methosifate, and 1.3\u00c210 \u00c03 M NAD (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in 0.2 M Tris buffer, pH 8.2] was added to all of the wells and incubated at room temperature. To measure the amount of LDH released into the supernatant, the plates were read in a microtiter plate reader at 490 nm after 5-10 min. The quantity of LDH released into the supernatant is directly proportional to NK-specific lysis of targets in experimental wells (24) . The percentage of NK cell-specific lysis was calculated as follows: [(OD E\u00feT \u00c0 OD E \u00c0 OD T-spon )/OD T-total \u00c0 OD T-AM )]\u00c2100, where E \u00bc effectors, T \u00bc targets, AM \u00bc assay medium, T-total \u00bc targets with 0.5% NP40, T-AM \u00bc targets with assay medium, and T-spon \u00bc T-AM minus the OD of AM control wells.",

To minimize handling stress for the pigs, which may affect the immune responses to viral infection, the pigs were handled by experienced personnel, and were bled by a veterinarian with vast experience. Even so, a minor effect on the overall immune responses in virus-infected pigs could not be ruled out. More severe clinical signs were observed in the pigs with co-infection than with either single-virus infection. Rectal temperatures of >39.58C were considered to be febrile responses. A significantly higher incidence of fever ( p < 0.05) was evident in more than 70% of dual virus-infected pigs compared to pigs infected with PRRSV alone (52%). Fever appeared in PRCV/PRRSV-infected pigs on PID 2/12, and persisted until PID 21/31 (Fig. 1A) .

To examine the systemic innate immune responses in the blood of PRCV/PRRSV co-infected pigs, the NK cell population and its cytotoxic function were analyzed. Only marginal changes were detected in the frequency of total NK cells (CD3 \u00c0 CD4 \u00c0 CD8 \u00fe ) in single-virus and coinfected pigs (Fig. 2A) . The NK-cell-specific lysis seen at different time points post-infection indicated that PRCV infection alone resulted in only a 10-30% reduction in NK cell lytic activity, whereas PRRSV infection alone resulted in significant reductions (50-80%) at different post-infection days. In dual virus-infected pigs, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was synergistically reduced by 80-100% (Fig. 2B) . The percentage reduction in NK-cell cytotoxicity was calculated in relation to mock-infected pigs (100%) at the respective post-infection days. The reductions in NK-cell cytotoxic function in dual-infected pigs was statistically significant on PRCV/PRRSV PID 2/12, 8/18, and 14/24, com-pared to mock-infected pigs, and compared to pigs infected with PRCV alone at PID 14/24. Significant reductions in NKcell function were detected at a higher effector:target cell ratio in PRCV-only-infected pigs at PRCV/PRRSV PID 2/12 and 8/18, compared to mock-infected pigs. Thus, prior infection with PRRSV suppressed the innate NK-cell cytotoxic function in pigs, which resulted in a further synergistic reduction in NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity following PRCV infection. Interestingly, the NK-cell cytotoxicity observed was independent of their frequency in virus-infected pigs.",

Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference for repeated sera collected from the respective pig groups (those infected with PRRSV alone and those infected with both viruses), as analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA.",

In this study, variability in immune responses was encountered, and this was attributed to the use of conventional outbred pigs, which reflects a similar scenario to that among the human population. We used large numbers of pigs in multiple independent trials in an attempt to assess the overall significance, and to mimic the variability observed in human viral co-infections. Although a trend for the experimental parameters assessed was reproducible among the different pig trials, statistically significant differences were only achieved for some cytokines analyzed at certain time points after the data from all six experiments were combined.",

In our study, the use of lung tissue homogenates to detect lung cytokines yielded satisfactory results. This method could be useful to assess lung cytokines, because cytokine levels in BAL fluid are usually low to undetectable for certain important cytokines. This approach with experimental animals may allow us to better understand the actual disease situation in lung infections constituting both acute and chronic respiratory viral diseases. Recently, cytokines in the lungs of swine influenza virus-infected pigs were analyzed using lung tissue homogenates (5) .",

In the same pig group during the later stages of infection, elevated PRRSV titers and antigen were detected, which may be due to high levels of IL-10 or IL-6 in the lung, with the latter influencing the generation of macrophages (11, 41) , the target cells for PRRSV infection.",

Elevated levels of Th-1 proinflammatory and T-regulatory cytokines, and reduced Th-2 cytokine levels, in addition to continued lower NK cellmediated cytotoxicity, resulted in persistent fever and reduced body weight gain in co-infected pigs. Measurements of cytokine levels and immune cell populations could serve as potential indicators of the progression of respiratory viral co-infections, and may provide more definitive approaches for treatment.",
