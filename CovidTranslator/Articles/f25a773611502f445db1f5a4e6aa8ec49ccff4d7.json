One of the most common claims for CBD is \"immune support\" or \"boosting.\" Now, under the threat of a global pandemic, many consumers and patients look for natural remedies to combat SARS-CoV-2 to protect themselves from infection. In light of this, a look at CBD and its impacts on the immune system is warranted as pharmacological effects suggest a potentially detrimental effect. The role of pharmacists as accessible, evidence-based medication experts throughout this pandemic is also considered.",

Immunomodulation may be mediated through cannabinoid receptors or myriad other pharmacological targets. 2 These net effects can be summarized as \"anti-inflammatory\" and are the sought after therapeutic effects of CBD for a variety of immune-mediated disorders including autoimmune conditions and neurodegeneration. These effects suppress cytokines and decrease chemokines, leading to suppression of effector T cells, microglial cells, and overall host response to pathogens including viruses like SARS-CoV-2. 2 Perhaps the best current medical knowledge on the impact of cannabidiol aloneon infection risk is limited to a phase 3 clinical trial of Epidiolex\u00ae (cannabidiol) dosed at 10 or 20 mg/kg/day for serious seizure disorders. 3 Infections were over 30% more common in those receiving CBD versus placebo. Among infections, viral (7% and 11% versus 6%) and pneumonia (8% and 5% versus 1%) had the largest relative increases for 10 and 20 mg/kg/day doses versus placebo, respectively. 3 Consumer doses of CBD are likely much lower than these therapeutic doses for refractory seizures but CBD doses through medical cannabis preparations could be equally potent. 1 Thus, current pharmacological and clinical evidence suggests CBD could decrease the ability fight off infections and is contrasted against its potential clinical uses as an anti-inflammatory. This risk may be higher for viral and respiratory infections. 3 Recommendations for patients and clinicians to avoid use of CBD and other cannabinoids during this pandemic may need to be encouraged unless medically supported for recognized indications (e.g. seizures, cancer, chronic pain).False marketing claims of \"immune system boosting\" or antiviral effects should be reported to regulatory bodies like the Food and Drug Administration.",
