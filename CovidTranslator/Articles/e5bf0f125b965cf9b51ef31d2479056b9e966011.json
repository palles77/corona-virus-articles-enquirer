Nested PCR followed by sequencing was performed to obtain the gag, pol, and env fragments. We used sample sequences of polymerase of 634 bp (regions covered: protease, 256-297; reverse transcriptase (RT), 1-592), gag of 284-296 bp (p17, 144-396; p24, 1-43), and envelope of 242-249 bp (gp160, 908-1158; gp120, 908-1158) to align with reference sequences retrieved from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov); the resulting neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees are shown in Figure 1 a-c. We report the detection of multiple HIV strains in injection drug users (IDU) in Macao, which appear to be derived from subtypes F, G, and CRF12_BF. A total of 14 HIV-infected IDU samples were collected and examined. Direct sequencing was performed to obtain the gag, pol, and env fragments. The subtypes of individual viral sequences were determined using the REGA subtyping tool. The concatenated sequences were aligned with reference sequences retrieved from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV database. We found 11 unusual cases in Macao, which showed characteristics of CRF12_BF (n = 2) and CRF14_BG (n = 8), and one that could not be classified into an existing subtype/CRF, along with three cases of CRF01_AE. Interestingly, the sequences derived from subtypes BG and BF recombinants have not been previously reported in any other Asian cities. Another subtype, CRF14_BG, has also been introduced into Macao among the IDUs. In conclusion, human activity, including travel over long distances and injection drug usage have fueled the spread of HIV and have provided a platform for recombination, which may otherwise have taken years to happen.",

The high query coverage and high similarity in gag and pol regions of MO008 and MO009 suggested that the year of first HIV-positive diagnosis was around 2000, which is in concordance with our records.

The most common HIV subtypes in Portugal are B, G and CRF14_BG. 8, 9 Coincidentally a cluster of CRF12_BF was reported in IDUs in southern Portugal in 2003, shortly before the Macao outbreak. 10 Subtype F strain has also been reported in the European countries of Spain, 2 Portugal, 8 and Italy. 11 The temporal and spatial information alongside the BLAST results suggests that IDUs in Portugal could have acquired CRF12_BF from South America and in turn introduced the strain into Macao.
