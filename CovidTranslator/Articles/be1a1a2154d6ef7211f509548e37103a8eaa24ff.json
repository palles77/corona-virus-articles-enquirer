Unlike many peripheral cell types, CNS neurons are generally non-renewable. Thus, the cytolytic and inflammatory strategies that are effective in controlling infections in the periphery could be damaging if deployed in the CNS. Perhaps for this reason, the immune response to some CNS viral infections favours maintenance of neuronal integrity and non-neurolytic viral control. This modified immune response -when combined with the unique anatomy and physiology of the CNS -provides an ideal environment for the maintenance of viral genomes, including those of RNA viruses. Therefore, it is possible that such viruses can reactivate long after initial viral exposure, contributing to CNS disease.",

Although such characteristics may limit infections of CNSresident cells, these barriers can be breached. Three major routes of viral entry into the brain have been identified: direct infection of the cells that comprise the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSF) barrier (with consequent release of viral particles into the parenchyma), infection of cells that are able to cross these barriers, and transneuronal migration across synapses from the peripheral nervous system (PNS) into the CNS (FIG. 1) .",

Neurotropic RNA viruses, including poliovirus (PV), measles virus (MV) and some flaviviruses, can circumvent these barriers by directly infecting the tightly associated endothelial or epithelial cells that comprise them 4 . Viral particles can then be released from the basolateral membrane into the parenchyma. For example, after MV infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells, release of viral particles occurs from both the apical and basolateral membranes, without disrupting cell polarity or barrier integrity, allowing MV to spread into the parenchyma 5 . Alternatively, barrier integrity may be compromised when the tight junctions between cells loosen as a result of inflammation and cytokine exposure, allowing free viral particles to diffuse directly from the blood or CSF into the brain. For example, peripheral West Nile virus (WNV) infection acts through the engagement of Tolllike receptor 3 (TLR3) to induce the synthesis of cytokines -including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -by circulating antigen-presenting cells 6 . In turn, TNF reduces BBB integrity by loosening tight junctions 7 , allowing for WNV migration through the less-restrictive BBB.",

            "text": "A third mode of CNS entry is transneuronal migration, a strategy adopted by rabies virus (RABV) and many herpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus (PRV). Intracellular trafficking in PNS neurons, which is necessary to shuttle cellular components to and from the synapse, can be commandeered to facilitate viral travel within and among synaptically connected neurons. The best-characterized examples of this type of spread are provided by herpesvirus members such as HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and the closely related PRV 4, 12 . After infection of epithelial cells in the oral mucosa, HSV-1 spreads to sensory and autonomic ganglia, establishing lifelong latency. Reactivation of the virus from latency -in response to decreases in immune monitoring, other infections or stress -leads to an active infection in PNS neurons, in which viral membrane proteins (including US9, glycoprotein E and glycoprotein I) can direct movement of newly replicated viral particles in an anterograde manner 13 . During transport, viral components are shuttled along axons via microtubule tracks and in association with their dynein and kinesin motors 14, 15 . Sensory neurons have a pseudo-unipolar morphology in which one axon is in contact with epithelial cells and the other synapses are in contact with CNS neurons 12 . Beyond the value of these studies to understand how neurotropic viruses are propagated, viruses that spread across synapses (including RABV and MV) have provided a valuable method to trace neural circuits in vivo 16, 17 ; that is, the use of recombinant viruses encoding fluorescent proteins. These unique virological tools may also allow the development of strategies to deliver therapeutic payloads from the periphery to the CNS.",

The former mechanism requires the release of viral particles through the neuronal membrane (chiefly, via budding out of the infected cell), whereas the latter mechanism is primarily dependent on viral proteins that mimic or co-opt cellular processes to direct the insertion of viral fusion proteins into a host cell membrane or to direct the spread of viral capsids, as seen with HSV 12, 18 . Both modes of viral spread occur in neurons; however, in most instances, viral transfer to adjacent neurons happens in the absence of syncytia formation (BOX 1), and little or no amount of extracellular infectious virus is detected, suggesting that neurons facilitate a distinct mode of spread for many viruses 4 . Interestingly, trans-synaptic spread of MV within primary mouse hippocampal neurons occurs independently of known MV receptors, which are crucial for syncytia formation in non-neuronal cells 19, 20 . The paucity of viral particles in the extracellular space may protect the neuron from plasma membrane damage via budding and facilitate evasion of antibody detection. Although many neurotropic infections spread by direct contact at the presynaptic-postsynaptic junction, alternative modes of transport may also be used. For example, although RABV primarily spreads trans-synaptically in a retrograde manner, an electron microscopy study showed the presence of viral particles in the extracellular neuronal space, accompanied by direct neuronal budding 21 .",

Variablesincluding detection threshold, target organs and cell-specific influences on the viral life cycle -collectively contribute to the challenge of establishing an agreed-upon nomenclature. Moreover, some viruses can reactivate to cause the same disease as the acute infection (such as HSV), whereas others manifest differently upon reactivation (such as varicella zoster virus (VZV), which causes chicken pox as a primary infection but typically causes shingles upon reactivation). Other viruses result in pathogenesis only after protracted infection (such as tumour-causing viruses).",

Latent infections are defined as those in which the virus establishes a non-lytic state during which host-to-host transmission is not possible, unless the virus reactivates to produce infectious virions. Chronic transmissible infections are characterized by the continuous production of infectious viral progeny and their ability to be transferred to new hosts. Chronic non-transmissible infections are those in which consistent detection of viral nucleic acid over extended periods of time is observed but in which transmission to new hosts does not occur.",

After initial infection of epithelial cells, these viruses become non-lytic within PNS neurons, and viral nucleic acid is maintained in a heterochromatin episomal state with negligible transcription 12 . A small number of viral transcripts are synthesized during latency and are termed latency-associated transcripts. These RNA species do not encode functional proteins but are thought to prevent neuronal apoptosis and to disrupt both innate and adaptive immune signalling through mechanisms that include inhibition of caspase activity and of granzyme B-mediated killing 24, 25 . VZV also produces various proteins, including ORF63, that prevent neuronal apoptosis 24 . The term 'latent' accurately conveys the status of these viruses: hidden, incapable of transmission, but able to fully reactivate, spread, and be transmitted to a new host. Another type of latency, which is not typically seen in neurons, occurs after viral nucleic acid is reverse transcribed from RNA to DNA and then integrated into the host genome. This process is unique to retroviruses, such as HIV-1 (REF. 26 ). In this type of latency, integrated viral genomic DNA becomes indistinguishable from host DNA, and viral genes can be epigenetically silenced or activated throughout the cell lifetime and passed on to daughter cells.",

One example may be the rare cases of MV CNS infection. Acute infection can, in some instances, lead to the development of neuropathogenic diseases, including subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and measles inclusion-body encephalitis. These uncommon neurological diseases often present months or years after viral exposure and are characterized either by negligible replication or by persistence of replication-competent nucleic acid in the CNS [30] [31] [32] . In both diseases, no viral dissemination to uninfected hosts has been reported. Determining whether the state of the virus that causes these sequelae is 'latent' or 'chronic non-transmissible' is difficult, owing to both the small number of clinical specimens available and the lack of small animal models that mimic SSPE disease 31, 33, 34 . In humans, it may be that neurological symptoms appear only once viral replication reaches a crucial threshold or when the virus infects a key site within the brain, exceeding the host's capacity to control the infection. Alternatively, non-replicating MV genomes may be maintained for prolonged periods and reactivated later. Either way, the MV genome remains intact, in some form, long after control of the acute infection is achieved, in the absence of further viral dissemination.",

The binding of these receptors to conserved motifs, such as double-stranded RNA, lipopolysaccharides or glycoproteins, propagates signals that culminate in the production of type I IFNs, chiefly IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2. These IFNs are secreted from the infected cell and act in both a paracrine and an autocrine manner by binding to IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR), a heterotetramer with phosphorylatable cytoplasmic domains. This engagement leads to the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases (including Janus kinases) and the receptor itself, and is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, which are usually abundant but inactive within the cytoplasm. Activated STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers couple with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form the complex termed ISGF3, which translocates into the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated response elements within the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These genes encode proteins that eliminate infected cells or aid in viral clearance. Type I IFNs also bind to adjacent, uninfected cells to shield them from infection. Although this pathway is operative in many cells, alternative IFN-triggered pathways that limit viral spread but do not depend on induction of the 'usual suspects', the ISGs, can be induced in some cell types, including neurons 37 .",

RABV, which infects muscle cells and peripheral neurons after a bite from an infected animal, induces copious IFN secretion early after infection, in vivo and in vitro 39 . By contrast, IFN-induced STAT phosphorylation in primary hippocampal neurons is delayed, with maximal activation occurring only after ~24 hours 40, 41 . Delayed STAT activation coincides with delayed expression of traditional ISGs 41 . The protracted interval between receptor binding and STAT activation may be due to a greatly reduced basal expression of STATs in these hippocampal neurons, as compared with other cell types [40] [41] [42] . Interestingly, lower homeostatic STAT expression is not unique to neurons but has also been observed in another non-renewable cell type, cardiac myocytes 43 . Like neurons, cardiac myocytes have high basal IFN\u03b2 expression, which may protect them from infection 41, 43 . Perhaps, the disparity between expression of IFNs and the signal transduction molecules that they induce may skew towards protection from infection rather than towards induction of a potentially cytotoxic response. Surprisingly, synthesis of ISGs can differ within a single neuron: IFN\u03b2 induces a non-canonical, local antiviral response in axons that is not observed in the neuronal soma 44, 45 . The startling implication of this finding is that neurons, especially those with long processes (as in the PNS), may 'compartmentalize' the response to extracellular immune mediators.",

Although most of these studies were performed using IFNARknockout mice lacking receptor expression on all cells, selective disruption of neuronal IFN signalling (using neuron-specific knockouts of IFNAR) also results in death after vesicular stomatitis virus infection 55 . Moreover, infection of olfactory neurons and mucosa with either a neurotropic RNA virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) or a neurotropic DNA virus (cytomegalovirus) leads to a robust type I IFN response deep within the brain, preventing viral spread and attendant disease 56 . Thus, infection of cells in direct contact with the environment (including sensory olfactory neurons) can trigger a long-distance warning (production of type I IFNs) that ultimately limits or precludes viral spread to remote regions of the brain.",

Recent findings have begun to resolve this mystery: these include the identification of lymphatic drainage portals from the CNS into deep cervical lymph nodes and the presence of a fluid gradient that flushes the brain of extracellular proteins (which are termed 'glymphatics' because of the crucial role of glia in this process) [57] [58] [59] . CSF moves towards the perivascular space, where it is transported into the dense brain parenchyma via aquaporin 4 water channels that are expressed on cortical astrocytes. The CSF movement drives the interstitial fluid towards perivenous spaces, where it then drains towards the newly identified meningeal or dura mater lymphatic vessels, and ultimately to the deep cervical lymph nodes, where T cell activation and proliferation can occur 57,59,60 . These studies indicated how antigens and professional antigen-presenting cells can exit the CNS to alert immature T cells in the lymph nodes.",

            "text": "After T cells mature in lymphoid tissues, they enter the bloodstream, where they can interact with adhesion molecules that are expressed on the surface of blood vessel endothelia within infected tissues. Mature T cells chiefly engage with selectins (and later, integrins) on the surface of the BBB or BCSF barrier. The expression of these adhesion molecules is induced by chemokines that are produced within the parenchyma by infected neurons and adjacent glia. This results in migration of T cells across the barrier (diapedesis). Although it was previously believed that neurons do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (and thus could not be recognized, at least in the canonical manner, by CD8 + T cells), we now know that some neuronal populations constitutively synthesize these cell surface proteins and that others can induce their expression after injury or infection 61, 62 . Even so, most neurons do not express typical levels of MHC class I antigens under noninflammatory conditions 63 , and thus T cell effector functions, including cytokine production, may not be triggered by the infected cell (the neuron) directly but rather by adjacent MHC class I-expressing cells (usually glia) that can display antigenic peptides via crosspresentation 64 . Although cross-presenting glia may not be directly infected, this strategy allows for elaboration of antiviral processes. Resident CNS cells may not only be invisible to immune cells as a result of reduced expression of MHC recognition molecules but may also express immunomodulatory molecules, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) 65 , that down-modulate T effector functions. Remarkably, the MHC class I expression system that is key to T cell recognition is likely to have also other functions in neurons, including those involved in neurodevelopment and neuronal plasticity 66, 67 .",

Activated STAT1 homodimers translocate into the nucleus and bind to gamma-activated sequences (GASs) in the promoters of approximately 100 genes (which overlap with, but are generally distinct from, the ISGs that are induced by type I IFNs), promoting their transcription and translation (FIG. 2a) .

In addition, IFN\u03b3 induces transcription of both traditional genes (that is, those that are typically expressed in response to IFN\u03b3 in other cellular populations) and non-traditional genes in primary hippocampal neurons after exposure 68 . This diverse profile of genes that are induced may affect the cellular outcome: although IFN\u03b3 can induce necroptosis, in neurons the virus is controlled in a non-cytolytic manner (presumably owing to the paucity of STAT1 and non-traditional GAS gene induction) 69, 70 (FIG. 2b) . This feature is not unique to neurons: IFN\u03b3 is also essential for controlling MHV infection of oligodendrocytes via non-cytolytic pathways 71, 72 . How are genes activated when basal levels of available STAT1 are low in resting neurons? Interestingly, when challenged with a neuron-restricted MV infection, most STAT1knockout mice survive. By contrast, all IFN\u03b3-knockout mice show severe signs of chronic disease, with approximately 50% succumbing to infection 68, 70 , suggesting that the requirement for IFN\u03b3 is decoupled from the main transducer through which it signals. This observation led to the identification of an IFN\u03b3-dependent, STAT1-independent activation of antiviral and pro-survival genes 68, 73 , which might be facilitated by the access of other signalling factors -including extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and AKT -to the activated IFN\u03b3 receptor when STAT1 is absent or not abundant (FIG. 2b,c) .",

Furthermore, these brain-resident lymphocytes have a unique molecular signature that distinguishes them from other types of cytotoxic T cells or from memory T cells 80 . T rm populations expand and contract in their resident tissue, acting as a first line of defence against reinfection 81 .

Perforins, which are found in the lytic granules of CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, punch holes in the membrane of infected target cells, allowing for the delivery of granzymes that lead to lysis of the infected cell. Granzymes are serine proteases that induce caspase cleavage and activation of pro-apoptotic cellular proteins, such as BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID). This mode of T cell-mediated killing, which efficiently eliminates 'viral factories', has been primarily studied in rapidly dividing cells. Interestingly, in some neuronal infections, the secretion of granzymes does not lead to lysis but rather aids in preventing viral reactivation and replication while sparing the infected neuron 82 . In addition to their ability to kill cells, granzymes can directly cleave eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G3 (eIF4G3) (a cellular protein that is important for host and viral translation) and ICP4 (a herpesvirus-specific protein needed for the transcription of early and late viral genes) 82, 83 . By cleaving eIF4G3, granzymes block viral translation but fail to induce neuronal apoptosis, further preventing viral dissemination within the host and sparing the infected neuron. Cleavage of ICP4 by granzymes directly prevents reactivation of latent HSV from infected neurons. In these instances, granzymes are acting on proteins other than their traditional protein targets to induce an alternative neuronal response.",

However, the existence of many subpopulations of neurons, which are segregated by location and function, raises the issue of whether responses may differ within these neuronal subsets. Recent studies showed that cerebellar granule neurons and cortical neurons pretreated with type I IFNs vary in their ability to control a WNV infection 89 . Type I IFN treatment had a much greater impact on the spread of infection in cerebellar granule neurons than it did in cortical neurons (100-fold versus 15-fold reduction), and this difference correlated with discrete patterns of ISG induction 89 . Animal model studies have also shown differences in the propensity for a virus to infect individual neuronal subpopulations and regions of the brain (FIG. 3) ; for example, the hippocampus is heavily infected by RABV, whereas MV is more often found in the midbrain [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] . Whether these distinctions can be attributed to differences in viral tropism or intrinsic variations in the neuronal response to soluble immune effector proteins (or, perhaps, to the way a virus gains access to the brain) is not known. Answering this question will require further studies that must necessarily integrate virology, immunology and neurobiology.",

Previously, many researchers believed that neurotropic RNA viruses were sterilely cleared from the CNS. Indeed, unlike DNA viruses or retroviruses that can establish latent infections through episome formation or integration, RNA viruses do not have known means to 'survive' within a host cell. This is especially relevant given the lability of RNA within the cytoplasm, which arises owing to the inherently unstable ribose subunit and the susceptibility of the 2\u2032 hydroxyl group to deprotonation. On the other hand, RNA viral genomes are unlikely to persist in the cytoplasm as naked RNA. Ribonucleoprotein complexes would provide some protection, and viral RNAs (like other cellular RNAs) may also be sequestered in stress granules. Thus, mechanisms must exist to protect RNA viral genomes, allowing for their long-term stability in the cytoplasm.",

In addition, some scientists have argued that MV entry into the human CNS may occur at a higher rate than previously thought 101 , although only a small fraction of acutely infected people will manifest neurological consequences. Accordingly, viral RNAs were generally considered 'fossils' that were unlikely to contribute to human disease.

The potential importance of viral nucleic acid persistence in demyelination has been subordinated by the prevailing view that long-term disease is caused by an overactivation of the host response towards myelin proteins. Other neurotropic RNA viruses that are known to persist within the mouse brain (sometimes for periods longer than 1 year post exposure) in the absence of detectable antigen or infectious viral progeny include Sindbis virus, Sendai virus and RABV 95, 105, 106 .

Translational studies have provided insights into the links between infections and disease but are not without controversy.

            "text": "Whether CNS virus infections have a larger role in human diseases of unknown aetiology remains controversial. In support of this notion, CNS neurons may be an ideal harbour for long-term infections: non-lytic immune mechanisms spare neuronal loss while providing an avenue for a non-cytopathic virus to persist. Moreover, trans-synaptic spread is likely to enable viral escape from antibody recognition or phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells. From an evolutionary perspective, neuronal survival is paramount; thus, sparing infected neurons a lytic fate may promote survival early on but could potentially open the door for viral reactivation later in life. We do not know if there are viruses that are typically found in CNS tissues of overtly healthy individuals; with the advent of the RNA sequencing technology, new RNA sequencing studies might shed light on the potential 'virome' within the brain of both asymptomatic individuals and people with neurological conditions. One final point that is worth noting concerns the utility of mouse models (on which many of the studies cited in this Review were based) to study human CNS diseases. Scientists often make the mistake of assuming that mouse survival is equivalent to an absence of disease. This may mean that the long-term ramifications of acute virus infections, especially those of RNA viruses that are not generally considered to be lifelong, may be overlooked. However, we are increasingly becoming aware that the presence of viral fragments or latent viruses that can reactivate might evoke non-lethal pathogenic consequences resulting from either viral replication and cell damage or immune responses directed against viral antigens. Such pathogenic consequences, as seen with the learning defects in LCMV-infected mice, may be subtle. Consequently, the parallel development of more-precise approaches to assess CNS disease in mice, including tools to evaluate the impacts on learning, behaviour and memory, should refine how we describe neuropathogenesis in the many valuable mouse models that are currently in use. Finally, determining whether or not persistent viral nucleic acids detected within the brain are replication competent and how these viruses evade complete clearance could promote the development of novel antiviral therapies to treat or prevent devastating and prevalent human neurological and neurodegenerative diseases 95, 113 .",

Trans-synaptic spread might require the same cellular and viral proteins that allow for fusion of non-neuronal cells or may be unique to the presynaptic-postsynaptic interface. For example, in MV neuronal infection, expression of the primary receptors that are used in non-neuronal cell infection is not required; however, a fusion event is still necessary for the spread to occur, perhaps, by forming a 'pore' through which the viral ribonucleic acid is transported 118 .",

In the 'Trojan horse' approach (right panel), infected lymphocytes or monocytes (including macrophages) traffic across the BBB or blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, releasing the virus once in the brain parenchyma. b | Trans-synaptic spread of viral particles involves the transport of viral genomes and associated proteins via microtubules and molecular motors.

In the right panel, the transport of viruses (including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV)) occurs across the epithelial or endothelial-neuron junction.
