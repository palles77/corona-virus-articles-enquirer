The strategy builds on the 2007 discussion paper by the Chief Medical Adviser to the Government. 2 A global-health strategy is needed because health is a global issue. The ease with which we can travel to all corners of the world has brought immense opportunities. But the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome 3 and the constant threat of pandemic infl uenza highlight the risks of our global interconnectivity. The current global economic crisis further highlights our interdependence. All too often global threats have the greatest consequences for poor countries-for those least able to cope, they can be catastrophic for health.",

We are committed to using expert independent evaluations to assess progress and inform future iterations of the strategy. At the launch the Secretary of State for Health, Alan Johnson, said that this is more than a UK Government initiative; it is a global partnership.

Vaccines are a rapidly growing part of the global pharmaceutical industry. But despite commercial success with human papillomavirus and some important conjugate vaccines, vaccines are missing or substandard for many of the greatest global killers: HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, H5N1 infl uenza, and many diarrhoeal diseases. 2 After major progress in pathogen genomics, analysis of innate immunity, and vaccine technology, the roadblock is not a lack of new ideas or candidate vaccines but the capacity and funding to take these through increasingly demanding and expensive clinical development.",

Concerns about avian infl uenza and the growing problem of bovine tuberculosis in England have encouraged IAH and Oxford groups to bring together their complementary programmes on developing vaccines for control of these diseases in livestock and human beings. Vaccines that could work in both species, such as a vaccine that targets the internal conserved antigens of the infl uenza virus 3 and a tuberculosis vaccine that encodes an antigen identical in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M bovis, have been prioritised. 4 Veterinary vaccine development is generally faster than that for human vaccines, and large animals may be better models of human vaccine performance than the vaccinologist's traditional murine substitute.",

This model results in an institute dispersed across multiple sites but one which provides investigators with access to a wide range of experience and specialist facilities, core activities being supported by the Wellcome Trust and other funders. Particular strengths in T-cell immunology, 5 B-cell memory, 6 and vectored vaccine technology 7 are being used to target human and livestock diseases of global signifi cance. A promising subunit vaccine for tuberculosis is the most advanced in clinical trials, 8 with major eff orts also directed at foot-and-mouth disease, 9 meningitis, 10 infl uenza, 11 HIV, and malaria. 12 A novel feature of the Institute is the strategic guidance and support it receives from a dedicated charity, the Jenner Vaccine Foundation.
