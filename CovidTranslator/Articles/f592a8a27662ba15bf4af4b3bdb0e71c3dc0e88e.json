Because oocysts are highly resistant to environmental stresses and to many disinfectants, hygienic measures on their own are not sufficient to avoid infection and long term contamination of calf rearing facilities (O'Donoghue, 1995) . In addition, many drugs and vaccines have been evaluated as potential therapeutic or prophylactic agents for cryptosporidiosis but with little success . Halofuginone lactate is a synthetic quinazolinone with cryptosporidiostatic activity on the sporozoite and merozoite stages of C. parvum (Jarvie et al., 2005) . It has been recommended for both therapeutic and prophylactic use as it delays the onset of infection, reduces shedding of oocysts, and decreases the severity of cryptosporidiosis in calves (Joachim et al., 2003; Jarvie et al., 2005) . Its effectiveness as a prophylactic treatment has not been evaluated for the various calf rearing systems used in Ireland. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of halofuginone lactate in decreasing the number of diarrhoeic calves kept in two rearing systems on a dairy farm with a high prevalence of cryptosporidiosis amongst neonatal calves. The secondary objective was to test the effect treatment and rearing systems may have on the onset of diarrhoeic signs and oocysts shedding, as well as on the number of calves excreting oocysts and the level of this excretion.",

Secondary PCR products of seven randomly chosen positive faecal samples and all positive environmental samples were sequenced to identify the genotype of the isolates present on the farm. In addition, these samples were further tested using another nested PCR that amplified a 850 b.p. fragment of the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene (Alves et al., 2003) . Similarly, secondary PCR products from this assay were also sequenced to identify the sub-genotype of the C. parvum isolates. A positive Cryptosporidium DNA template and a negative control were included in every PCR assay. Purification and sequencing of the amplicons were carried out by a commercial company (MWG Biotech AG, Germany). The amplified PCR products were sequenced in both directions using forward and reverse primers of the secondary PCR. Sequences were assembled, edited and aligned with reference sequences from GenBank using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, USA). The recently proposed nomenclature was used in labelling the C. parvum subtypes (Sulaiman et al., 2005) .",

The non-parametric method Kaplan-Meier method was used to create the survivor function to visually compare the groups of calves for the onset of diarrhoea and oocyst shedding (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) . Four statistical tests, i.e. the log-rank test, the Wilcoxon test, the Tarone-Ware test and the Peto-Peto-Prentice and Harrington-Flemming tests, were conducted to test for significant differences (p < 0.05) between the survivor functions. The differences among the four tests depended on the weights used to combine the estimates derived at each point in time (Dohoo et al., 2003a) . Further, generalized estimating equations models (GEE) were used to test for any significant effect (p < 0.05) that treatment and rearing systems may have on the number of diarrhoeic calves and calves shedding oocysts and also on the level of oocyst excretion, taking into account repeated observations for each animal (Dohoo et al., 2003b) .

This difference was statistically confirmed by the four tests, i.e. log-rank, Wilcoxon, Tarone-Ware, Peto-Peto-Prentice and Harrington-Flemming, used to test whether the overall survivor functions in the groups are equal (p < 0.05). For the event of diarrhoea, the Peto-Peto-Prentice and Harrington-Flemming test was the most appropriate test when comparing the Kaplan-Meier curves of the treated and the control groups of animals because this test takes into account different censoring patterns between the groups and, in this case, diarrhoea was not detected for five calves treated with halofuginone lactate while all placebo calves had diarrhoea at some stage of the experiment (Table 2) . Only one calf was censored for the event of infection; therefore, the log-rank test that assigns equal weight at each time point, was selected (Table 2) . A significant correlation between diarrhoea and infection was found when comparing the experimental groups treated with halofuginone lactate and placebo at the age 10 days (p = 0.03).

Delaying the onset of diarrhoea is important as newborn calves are susceptible to dehydration and acid-base balance disturbances. Since these risks decrease with age, the preventive use of halofuginone lactate may delay infection and the onset of clinical signs to an age when animals are better able to cope with the pathogenic affects of the parasite. Additional benefits of halofuginone lactate treatment are reduction in the number of infected animals exhibiting signs of enteritis and in the amount of oocysts they excrete (Joachim et al., 2003; Lallemand et al., 2006) . As shown in the current study, the efficacy of halofuginone lactate is decreased when calves are maintained in less than optimal conditions such as mixed together in group pens. The benefits of good husbandry were also evident when the placebo groups were compared. Calves reared in the individual pens excreted significantly less oocysts than calves kept in the group pen.",

This so-called \"rebound phenomenon\" has been reported by previous workers Lallemand et al., 2006) . As observed in this study, it is generally considered that it has limited clinical consequences and does not markedly increase the cumulative amount of oocysts produced by treated calves. Explanations for its occurrence might include re-infection, activation of an auto-infection phase with thin-wall oocysts and/or re-activation of inhibited stages (Villacorta et al., 1991; Naciri et al., 1993) . Another possibility is that the older calves may have been infected with different Cryptosporidium species. However, the sequencing of 18S gene and Gp60 gene fragments carried out on isolates from faecal samples collected from some calves exhibiting the rebound phenomenon indicated that they were C. parvum subtype A18G3R1, the prevailing Cryptosporidium strain amongst the experimental calves. The calves, that received the placebo, did not show any evidence of a recrudescence of oocysts excretion at 21 days. This may be attributable to some degree of acquired resistance from the initial infection .",

In addition, the CART model identified the age of the calf as the strongest discriminating risk factor for bovine cryptosporidiosis. Calves over 7 days old were more likely to be infected than younger animals whether or not they received halofuginone lactate. Silverlas et al. (2009) came to the same conclusion after their metaanalysis of data from a number of previous studies. Other workers have also reported a similar age predisposition in the susceptibility of calves to cryptosporidiosis (Kvac et al., 2006; .
