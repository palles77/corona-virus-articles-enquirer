Until then nothing was known about the morphology of virus particles, because of their extremely small size (20-500 nm in diameter). Most of them are below the detection limit of the light microscope, and their size was approximately determined through filtration experiments. It is the electron microscope with its high resolving power that has revealed the great variety of virus morphology.",

However, the preparation techniques at that time were cumbersome and timeconsuming, and it was not until the introduction of the negative staining technique (Brenner and Horne, 1959) , that the electron microscope became an instrument of practical value in virology.",

Speed is essential in cases of smallpox and herpes encephalitis, where the handling of the epidemiological situation and the treatment and prognosis depend on a correct and rapid diagnosis. And electron microscopy is a rapid method. By negative staining and electron microscopy preparation, examination and identification of a virus may be done in minutes or hours. By standard virological methods, primarily isolation of virus in cell cultures, eggs or animals, it may take days or weeks before the answer is available. But also in combination with inoculation of virus samples in cell cultures electron micro scopy may be useful. If the cytopathic effect on the cells is not typical, a rapid demonstration of characteristic virus particles will save time and reagents (Doane et aI., 1969; Pennington et aI., 1975) .",

Ammoniummolybdate for example has a preserving effect on membranes, whereas uranylformate stabilizes lipid containing viruses by binding to phospholipids. As an acid solution reveals the finest surface detail, while an alkaline solution visualizes inner structures, an unknown object ought to be examined with different stains at different pH-values in order to find the optimal conditions for this particular particle. In virus diagnostic work, however, this approach would be much too time-consuming, and since most viruses are effectively stained with a 2-3 % solution of phosphotungsticacid (PTA) adjusted with KOH to pH 7, this may be choosen as an allround stain.",

Figures 15 and 16 show examples of viruses, which were identified in cell cultures by EM after months with confusing results by other methods. Control of cell cultures used for propagation of virus is important, as primary cell cultures from monkey kidney tissue are widely used, but unfortunately harbour simian viru ses. These viruses do not always produce a recognizable cytopathic effect, but may however interfere with or inhibit isolation of human virus (Anderson and Do ane, 1970) . Periodic checks by EM of primary cell cultures and viru s pools prepared in simian cell cultures help to avoid this problem. Figure 17 shows a Foam y agent particle , one of the contaminant viru ses of monkey cells.",
