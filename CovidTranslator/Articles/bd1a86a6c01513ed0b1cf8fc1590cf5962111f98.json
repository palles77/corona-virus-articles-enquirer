            "text": "Most recently, Chan et al. 1 reported, in this journal, that convalescent SARS patients' sera may contain crossreactive antibodies against the emerging novel human coronavirus EMC/2012 (hCoV-EMC) detected by both immunofluorescent and neutralizing antibody tests. 1 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the causative agent of SARS, uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its cellular receptor to bind to the target cells, 2 and a 193amino acid fragment (residues 318e510) in the S1 subunit of vial spike (S) protein is the identified receptor-binding domain (RBD). 3 The recent emergence of hCoV-EMC has caused 17 people infected including 11 deaths (http:// www.who.int/csr/don/2013_03_26/en/), raising serious concern about its potential pandemic. Unlike SARS-CoV, hCoV-EMC uses a different receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), 4 for its binding and entry into the target cell. We have predicted that a 286-amino acid fragment (residues 377e662) of hCoV-EMC S1 region contains the viral RBD. 5 Previously we reported that the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein contains multiple neutralizing epitopes that induce potent neutralizing antibodies and protection against SARS-CoV infection in animal models. 6e8 Thus, neutralizing antibodies targeting the S protein, particularly the RBD, play the most important roles in the inhibition of viral infection. Since both SARS-CoV and hCoV-EMC genetically belong to the genus betacoronavirus, 9, 10 we thus speculate that the antibodies induced by the RBD of SARS-CoV may have cross-reactivity or cross-neutralizing activity against hCoV-EMC.",
