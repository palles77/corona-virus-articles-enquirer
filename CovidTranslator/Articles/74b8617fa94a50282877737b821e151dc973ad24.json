The downstream ORF 5b encodes the envelope (E) protein, an integral membrane protein of the virus. We have shown previously that the expression of ORF 5b is mediated by the internal entry of ribosomes. In the experiments reported here, we have used the in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs to identify the region of mRNA 5 that mediates internal ribosome entry. Our results show that the 5 border of the MHV mRNA 5 IRES element is located between nucleotides 227 and 244 in ORF 5a, while the 3 border is located between nucleotides 140 and 172 in ORF 5b. The MHV mRNA 5 IRES element, therefore, contains not more than 280 nucleotides and encompasses the ORF 5b initiation codon. As evidenced by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the IRES element of mRNA 5 interacts specifically with protein factors present in an L-cell lysate.",

In MHV-infected cells, viral gene expression is mediated by a characteristic 3 coterminal set of subgenomic mRNAs. These mRNAs are structurally polycistonic (with the exception of the smallest) but only the unique region of each mRNA, i.e. the region that is not present in the next smallest mRNA, is translated [25, 35] . Normally, the unique region of coronavirus mRNAs contain only one functional open reading frame (ORF). For MHV, however, three mRNAs, mRNA 1, mRNA 5 and mRNA 7, are exceptions [4, 6, 9, 36] .",

Protein initiation by internal ribosome entry is best studied amongst the picornaviruses but there are several examples of viral and cellular mRNAs that initiate translation by internal ribosome entry (for a review see [33] ). The region of the mRNA that is required for the internal ribosome entry and translational initiation has been termed the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) [18] . In the experiments reported here, we have investigated the translation of mRNA 5 of MHV (strain A59). We demonstrate that the translation of MHV A59 ORF 5b is initiated by internal ribosome entry and show that the ribosome entry site encompasses nucleotides spanning ORF 5a and ORF 5b and, thus, includes the initiation codon of ORF 5b. Furthermore, as envidenced by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the MHV A59 mRNA 5 IRES element interacts specifically with one or more L-cell proteins.",

            "text": "We have shown previously that the expression of the MHV JHM E protein i.e., the ORF 5b gene product, is mediated by the internal entry of ribosomes on mRNA 5 [38] . To confirm that the same mechanism is also used by the closely related murine hepatitis virus, strain A59, we first of all constructed the tricistronic plasmid A59pZ15ab. This plasmid contains a truncated \u2424-galactosidase gene (ORF Z1) in front of the MHV A59 ORFs 5a and 5b. After the in vitro translation of synthetic RNA derived from A59pZ15ab, three major translation products could be observed (Fig. 2, lane 4) . One of these, with an M r of approximately 26000, is present in the water control and probably represents the translation of endogenous mRNA. The other two, with apparent molecular masses of approximately 45000 and 9000, can be identified as products of ORF Z1 and ORF 5b respectively. The product of M r 45000 has the same mobility as the translation product of RNA derived from the construct pZ1, i.e., the truncated \u2424-galactosidase protein (lane 4). The product of M r 9000 has the same mobility as the translation product of RNA derived from the construct A59p5b, i.e., the MHV A59 E protein (lane 3). The possibility that the 9000 product is translated from the MHV A59 ORF 5a is excluded by the experiments described below. These results show clearly that the translation of the MHV-A59 ORF 5b protein is initiated by internal ribosome entry. By analogy to the situation in picornaviruses, it seemed likely that, at least, part of the MHV A59 IRES element would precede and be adjacent to the ORF 5b initiation codon, i.e., in ORF 5a. To test this idea, we made four derivates of A59pZ15ab, each with a progressively larger deletion in ORF 5a. The in vitro translation products of synthetic RNAs derived from these plasmids, A59pZ15 1-226ab, A59pZ15 1-243ab, A59pZ15 1-283ab and A59pZ15 1-311ab are shown in Fig. 2 (lane 6 to 9) . First, the deletion of more than two-thirds of ORF 5a, i.e., nucleotides 1 to 226 (A59pZ15 1-226ab) had no effect on the expression of the ORF 5b product (lane 6). However, the deletion of an additional 17 nucleotides (A59pZ15 1-243ab) resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of ORF 5b protein translated (lane 7). PhoshorImager quantitation of the radioactivity incorporated in the ORF 5b protein shown in lanes 6 and 7, indicated that this decrease was approximately 28%. Further deletions in ORF 5a (A59pZ15 1-283ab and A59pZ15 1-311ab) reduced the expression of the ORF 5b product even more significantly (lanes 8 and 9). In this case, the reductions were measured to be 45% and 89%, respectively. Second, it should be noted that the product of ORF Z1 is translated from all constructs in similar amounts. Thus, these data indicate that, in functional terms, the 5 boundary of the MHV A59 mRNA 5 IRES lies between nucleotides 227 and 243 in ORF 5a. Next we investigated where the 3 boundary of the MHV A59 mRNA 5 IRES element is located. In the course of earlier experiments, we had noted that the insertion of additional nucleotides towards the 5 end of the MHV ORF 5b (in the context of either bicistronic or tricistronic constructs) had a detrimental effect on the translation of the ORF 5b protein (Thiel, unpublished) . Also, it is now well established that the IRES element of the hepatitis C virus extends over the initiation codon and into the coding region of the virus genome [30] . Thus, we decided to examine the translational activity of synthetic RNAs derived from constructs with additional deletions in the ORF 5b region. Synthetic RNAs, derived from constructs with deletions in both ORF 5a and ORF 5b, A59pZ15 1-226a 171-249b and A59pZ15 1-226a 140-249b, were examined by in vitro translation. The results are shown in Fig. 3 . First, RNA derived from A59pZ15 1-226a 171-249b synthesized more ORF 5b translation product, which is truncated by 27 amino acids compared to the authentic E protein, than the equimolar amount of RNA derived from the construct A59Z5 1-226ab (lanes 5 and 6). The increase was measured to be 48%. Second, RNA derived from A59pZ15 1-226a 140-249b synthesized significantly less ORF 5b translation product, which is truncated by 37 amino acids compared to the authentic E protein, than RNA derived from the construct A59Z5 1-226ab (lanes 5 and 7). In this case, the reduction was measured to be 78%. It should be noted that the truncated \u2424-galactosidase protein is expressed in equal amounts from RNA derived from all three constructs and that the number of methionines in the three different ORF 5b translation products is the same. These results suggest that the 3 boundary of the MHV A59 mRNA 5 IRES element lies between nucleotides 140 and 171 in ORF 5b. Fig. 4 . Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showing the binding of L cell proteins to RNA derived from A59p5D1-226aD171-249b. The radiolabeled RNA was incubated without the addition of lysate (1), with 5, 7.5 and 10 l of L cell lysate (g/l) (2-4), with 5, 7.5 and 10 l of L cell lysate (2 g/l)and 10 g tRNA (5-7), with 5, 7.5 and 10 l of L cell lysate (2 g/l) and 3 g of unlabeled RNA derived from A59p5D1-226aD171-249b (8-10). Protein complexes and free RNA were separated in a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel After determining of the boundaries of the MHV A59 mRNA 5 IRES element, we were interested in detecting possible interactions between the IRES element and cellular proteins. To do this, we did electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Based upon the results described above, we constructed the plasmid A59p5 1-226a 171-249b, which contains the region of the MHV A59 mRNA 5 that is essential for internal ribosome entry and ORF 5b initiation. This plasmid was transcribed in vitro in the presence of [alpha-32 P]UTP and the 32 P-labeled RNA obtained was incubated with different amounts of L cell lysate. The free and bound RNAs were then resolved on a non-denaturating 6% polyacrylamide gel. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . By adding increasing amounts of L cell lysate to the binding reaction, an RNA-protein complex can be observed (Fig. 4 , lanes 2 to 4) which is not present when the L cell lysate was omitted (lane 1). To examine the specificity of the complex formation, nonspecific and specific competitor RNA was used. The presence of tRNA (10 g) in the binding reaction did not inhibit the formation of the RNA-protein complex (lanes 5 to 7). The presence of homologous unlabeled RNA, i.e., the transcript of A59p5 1-226a 171-249b, in a 30 molar excess, prevented complex formation completely (lanes 8 to 10). These results indicate that the nucleotides extending from position 227 in ORF 5a to position 170 in ORF 5b are able to specifically bind proteins present in the L cell extract.",

If this is true, then perhaps the MHV IRES element, which is relatively short compared to the IRES elements of other positive strand RNA viruses [8, 17, 26, 30] , may be a suitable system in which to identify and analyse some of these features. Thus, for example, in relation to cis-acting elements, an oligopyrimidine tract, adjacent and upstream of the initiating codon, seems to be a conserved feature. Hence, it may be relevant that 22 nucleotides upstream of the MHV ORF 5b initiation codon, a stretch of 13 nucleotides, UUUUAUUCUUUUU (see Fig. 1b) , is positioned. Our preliminary mutation analysis indicates that these nucleotides cannot be altered without a negative effect upon the initiation of ORF 5b translation (Jendrach, unpublished) but further experiments are required to link this putative element to, for example, the binding of a specific protein. Also, now that we have delineated the MHV mRNA 5 IRES element to approximately 280 nucleotides, it should be possible to predict potential secondary structures, or the presence of conserved structural motifs in loop regions (which may be indicative of tertiary structures) and to make comparisons with the postulated common RNA structural motifs involved in the internal initiation of translation [22, 23, 32] .",

This situation is not unique; it has been shown that the IRES element of hepatitis C virus encompasses up to 30 nucleotides of the HCV coding region and that the HCV initiation codon is involved in a stem-loop structure [14, 15, 29, 30] . In the context of the MHV mRNA 5, it is clearly intriguing to imagine how ORF 5b translational initiation and ORF 5b translational elongation can occur simultaneously. Perhaps they do not and this may, at least in part, explain the low levels of E protein synthesized in the virus-infected cell [42] .",

The obvious next step will be to identify these proteins by UV-crosslinking assays. The ribosome entry sites of picornaviruses and hepatitis C virus are known to bind several proteins, including La autoantigen, pyrimidine tract-binding protein, p25 and the PCBP1 and PCBP2 proteins (for a review see [1-3, 10, 11, 19] ). How these proteins mediate the internal initiation event is not known in detail but it seems likely that, at least in some situations, they facilitate the entry of the 40S ribosome subunit at a specific site and restrict initiation to a translation initiation window [28, 31] . Obviously, it would not be surprising to find that some of these proteins are also involved in the function of the MHV mRNA 5 IRES element.",

            "text": "Finally, we would like to draw attention to what, in our opinion, is a significant difference between the MHV mRNA 5 IRES element and, for example, the IRES elements of picornaviruses. In the course of infection, picornaviruses specifically shut off the cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs [37] . Therefore, of neccessity, they have evolved a mechanism that allows for the cap-independent translation of their own mRNA; namely internal ribosome entry and translation initiation. Evidently, this cannot have been the \"evolutionary\" explanation of the MHV mRNA 5 IRES element. All of the MHV mRNAs have an identical leader sequence of approximately 88 nucleotides which is capped at the 5 end. Although it has not been experimentally proven, it is thought that, with the exception of mRNA 5, translation is initiated on these mRNAs in a cap-dependent manner according to the conventional ribosomal scanning model of Kozak [20] . To say the least, it is puzzling that, in the case of mRNA 5, the expression of an essential structural protein appears to take place from a functionally bicistronic mRNA using a different mechanism of translational initiation. A better understanding of the replication strategy and biology of MHV will, perhaps, help to resolve this apparent paradox.",
