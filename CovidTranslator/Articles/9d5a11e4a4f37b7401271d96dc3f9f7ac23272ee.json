In the United States, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed 14,627 deaths to AIDS in 2006 [11] . Yet, the number of AIDS-related publications far exceeds the two U.S. infection control journals (AJIC and ICHE) even though nearly seven times as many people died from HAIs. With the continued threat of emerging and the persistence of reemerging diseases, the opportunity for HAIs to burden the health care system will not diminish [12] .",
