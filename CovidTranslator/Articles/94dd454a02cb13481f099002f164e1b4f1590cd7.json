            "text": "Rapid screening and low-cost diagnosis play a crucial role in choosing the correct course of intervention e.g., drug therapy, quarantine, no action etc. when dealing with highly infectious pathogens. This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, therefore, resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To create an ultra-low-cost device, the architecture proposed exploits the intrinsic properties of silicon and integrates three modes of operation in a single chip: i) electrical (Joule) heater, ii) temperature sensor (i.e. thermistor) with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA. Using TriSilix, the sample solution can be maintained at a single, specific temperature (needed for isothermal amplification of NA such as Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) or cycled between different temperatures (with a precision of \u00b11.3 \u00b0C) for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) while the exact concentration of amplicons is measured quantitatively and in real-time electrochemically. A single 4-inch Si wafer yields 37 TriSilix chips of 10\u00d710\u00d70.65 mm in size and can be produced in 7 hours, costing ~US $0.35 per device. The system is operated digitally, portable and low powercapable of running up to 35 tests with a 4000 mAh battery (a typical battery capacity of a modern smartphone). We were able to quantitatively detect a 563-bp fragment (Insertion Sequence IS900) of the genomic DNA of M. avium subsp.",

This large gap in the diagnostic workflow hampers attempts to contain infectious pathogens from spreading by rapid and early detection.

Hence tests targeting NA tend to be exceptionally sensitive. NA-based reagents (e.g., primers) for NA testing can also be produced synthetically rapidly and on a large scale; DNA-based molecules, in particular, are highly stable, therefore, do not require a cold-chain for storage, making it especially suitable for PoN testing. 1 Ability to produce NA quickly also increases the speed of development and deployment of new test kits to health systems, providing much needed diagnostic capabilities for the detection of novel pathogens (such as SARS-CoV-2).

Using cleanroom-based semiconductor fabrication methods, such systems have been reported; [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] however, these devices require advanced methods of microfabrication that can only be performed in a cleanroom, such as photolithography, vacuum etching/deposition etc. They also do not exploit the intrinsic properties of the semiconductor materials that are used as substrates (i.e. Si itself can be used both as a temperature sensor and electrical heater). Hence the devices reported are complex and expensive. Because semiconductor foundries are mainly located in East Asia, manufacturing and logistics are susceptible to disruptions in the supply chain due to unexpected events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). There is, therefore, still no viable low-cost, rapid, quantitative, integrated handheld NA testing solution available for use in the field with the potential for market wide availability.",

Hence it is resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To achieve cleanroom-free, low-cost fabrication, we have developed a series of fabrication methodologies based on wet etching to form porous Silicon, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting ( Figure 1A ). To reduce costs and complexity, TriSilix exploits the intrinsic properties of the semiconductor Si which can be used as a resistive heating device and thermistor simultaneously. TriSilix has three modes of operation: i) electrical (Joule) heater, ii) thermistor with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) label-free electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA with methylene blue as a redox-active reporter. TriSilix works with both cyclic and isothermal methods of amplification. We demonstrate that TriSilix can detect NA from both bacteria (Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis) and viruses (SARS-CoV-2) with high specificity.",

Using the Randles-Sevcik equation with experimentally measured gradient values of 0.71 \u00b1 0.08, we determined that the Au film has a 2x larger electroactive area than the geometrically defined area due to the high porosity of the Au film, which is beneficial for highperformance electrochemical analysis ( Figure S2) .

The circuit ( Figure 3D ) implements a voltage controlled constant current source which can be adjusted digitally using a low-cost microcontroller (Arduino Due). This circuit can also measure the voltage drop across the TriSilix chip; when a constant current is applied, the resistance (hence the temperature) of the TriSilix thermistor can be calculated using the voltage reading, and Ohm's law.

            "text": "First, we characterized the electrochemical redox processes for methylene blue (MB) using cyclic voltammetry (Figure 4A) . We chose MB because the electrochemical approach we used for the detection of DNA involves the use of MB [23] [24] [25] as an intercalating redox reporter. During NA amplification, MB is intercalated between guanine-cytosine base pairs of the double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) which provides an electroanalytical signal correlated with the concentration of ds-DNA in the sample. We prepared a 125 \u00b5g mL -1 solution of MB in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline pH 7 (PBS) and swept across a range of potentials between -400 to 200 mV at a scan rate of 100 mV s \u22121 to characterize the electrochemical processes involving MB and electrodes. We determined that the anodic peak current, originating from the oxidation of MB on the electrode surface, appears at \u221267\u00b12 and cathodic peak (due to reduction) at \u221297\u00b14 mV versus Ag ( Figure 4A ). The absence of peaks with nearly overlapping anodic and cathodic curves in buffer alone indicates that the electrodes are electrochemically and mechanically stable and high performance (e.g., low capacitive current). We have performed ( Figure 4B ) square wave voltammetry (SWV), a substantially more sensitive electroanalytical method, to measure the concentration of MB in PBS in a range between 0 -125 \u00b5g mL -1 using a potential window from -500 mV to -250 mV versus Ag (corresponding to the anodic process). The SWV measurements using TriSilix produces an electroanalytical signal (peak current intensity) that is linearly related to the concentration of MB in the range 0.5 \u00b5g mL \u22121 -80 \u00b5g mL \u22121 with an R 2 = 0.9963 ( Figure 4C curve denoted by 'RT'). We have also characterized the analytical performance of TriSilix for performing SWV measurements when the chip was operated at elevated temperatures. To prevent evaporation of the solvent (i.e. water) from the sample solution, a small amount (10 \u00b5L) of mineral oil was added to the reservoir. Since both isothermal and cyclic NA amplification reactions require heating; the effect of temperature on the electrochemical measurements is important. As shown in Figure 4C , the peak current intensity (measured from the recorded SWVs) increased two to four times in comparison to room temperature when operated at higher temperatures; this is due to enhanced transport of the analyte to the surface of the electrode. 26- author/funder.

We speculate that this could be related to thermal and electrical crosstalk between the heater and the electrochemical sensing structures which introduce additional noise to the electroanalytical measurements at higher temperatures. We have also studied the thermal stability of MB over time (Figure 4D) . In this experiment, we added MB to the PCR and RPA mastermix solutions to simulate the conditions during isothermal and cyclic amplification reactions. As illustrated in Figure 4D (and Figure S6) , MB remained relatively stable both at 40 \u00b0C over 45 mins (i.e. RPA conditions) and 35 cycles of PCR conditions (30 sec for each step at 94 \u00b0C, 63 \u00b0C and 72 \u00b0C; every 5 th cycle, the temperature is reduced to 40 \u00b0C for the measurement to increase precision as illustrated in Figure S7 ) indicated by the small spread of the measurements. The SWV measurements at elevated temperatures produced similar results to the measurements taken at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) in terms of repeatability, in agreement with the findings in the literature by other groups although we did observe a slight decrease in stability for the PCR conditions (i.e. higher temperatures). 23 The results of the thermal stability experiments indicate that MB is a sufficiently stable redox-active reporter for use in NA amplification reactions at elevated temperatures.",

PE sheets were laser-cut (Model: Trotec Speedy 100; Wavelength: 1\u00b5m; Power: 20 W) and the patterns were transferred to the porous surfaces of the Si wafer (both front and back) by heat-pressing at 180 \u00b0C for 5 min. The regions cut out were later electroplated to form the WE and electrical contacts. The Cu-PET (20 \u00b5m Cu; 23 \u00b5m PET) sheets were purchased from UK Insulations Ltd. and laminated with an additional sheet of PE film at 180 \u00b0C for 5 min in a heat press to improve thermal bonding on pSi surfaces. The Cu-PET-PE laminates were also laser-cut using a fiber laser, electroplated with Ag and heat-pressed on the top side of the Si wafer to form the electrodes for the CE and RE.

The heat pressed layers define the shape of the Working Electrode (WE) on the top surface and electrical contacts for Joule heating/resistance measurements on the bottom surface of the wafer. The patterned, and heat pressed polymer sheets essentially act as masking layers for electroplating of the metal electrodes on the pSi surface equivalent to photolithography-based patterning in conventional microfabrication. Next, the unmasked areas of the pSi surface were cleaned in 5% HF and electroplated by Au in a bath containing an aqueous solution of 10 mM KAu(CN)2/KCN for 10 min under a constant current of 10 mA versus Pt electrode (5\u00d75 cm) yielding ~100 nm thick porous Au films. To achieve high uniformity when electroplating across the wafer, we have designed, and 3D printed a custom, electroplating platform that allows circular electrodes to be attached around the perimeter of the Si wafer (Figure S1). To form a three-electrode electrochemical cell on the top surface, the Counter (CE) and Reference Electrodes (RE) were created by heat pressing an Ag-plated Cu-PET-PE film, patterned once again by laser cutting. Ag plating was performed in an aqueous solution of 10 mM AgCN/KCN under an applied current of 20 mA versus Pt electrode (using the electroplating holder).",

During amplification, the number of amplicons increases exponentially with time if the DNA target is present in the sample. When new amplicons are generated, MB interacts with the G-C pairs and can no longer participate in the electron-transfer reactions with the working electrode hence the electroanalytical signal, originating from the redox-active reporter, decreases with increasing concentration of amplicons (and the target DNA in the original sample). qRPA using TriSilix with MB as the redox-active reporter. We used the TwistAmp Basic kit (TwistDx, UK) with the positive (3.2 kbp template, 144-bp amplicons) and negative (100-bp CTX-M ESBL; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases) DNA controls in the experiments. We have slightly modified the mastermix solution provided in the kit to contain 10 \u00b5g mL -1 of MB to enable electrochemical detection in real time. 30 \u00b5L of the modified-mastermix was introduced into sample reservoir of TriSilix followed by the addition of 10 \u00b5L of mineral oil to prevent evaporation. The sample was heated to 40 \u00b0C for 40 min and a square-wave voltammogram was recorded every 2.5 min during the reaction. As shown in Figure 5A, while the electroanalytical signal (normalized peak current intensity) remained relatively unchanged for the negative control, the positive control (50 -150 nM according to the manufacturer) showed a large drop in signal in the form of a characteristic sigmoidal profile. This result demonstrates that TriSilix can perform real-time and quantitative DNA analysis through (isothermal) RPA reactions. In the next experiment, we have performed qPCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from clinical samples of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) K10 strain. MAP is the causative microorganism of Johne's Disease affecting ruminant animals and is controversially associated with Crohn's Disease in humans. MAP is, therefore, an important analytical target which requires routine testing in centralized laboratories through microbial cultures or conventional fluorescence qPCR (lasting up to 3 hours). 29-31 Using TriSilix, we have first performed a titration experiment to determine the limit-of-detection (LoD) of genomic DNA from MAP K10 without amplification over a range of 0-200 pg (",
