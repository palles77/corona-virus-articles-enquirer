Recent prospective surveillance of 98 lung transplant recipients in Spain found an overall rate of respiratory viruses, asymptomatic and symptomatic, of 0.76 per patient-year and a significantly higher rate of 2.1 RVIs per patient-year in symptomatic patients. 3 Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from asymptomatic patients were positive 11.5% of the time compared with 55.4% positive in symptomatic patients. The most frequently detected RVIs in symptomatic patients were picornaviruses, such as rhinovirus and enterovirus, at 43%, followed by coronavirus (16.7%) and influenza (16.7%). Symptomatic RVI detection progressed to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in 40% of patients. 3 A prospective Swiss study reported similar results with an RVI incidence of 0.83 per patient-year, detection of respiratory viruses in 14% of those screened and 34% of symptomatic patients, and rhinovirus/enterovirus as the most common RVI. 4 Human bocavirus, identified in 2005, has been reported to cause upper respiratory infection (URI), fevers, wheezing, LRTI, and diarrhea in normal hosts, and plays an unclear role in SOT recipients. 5 Parainfluenza, RSV, hMPV, and influenza were the most frequently found viruses in LRTI and were associated with higher rates of hospitalization. Analyses of RVI in lung transplant recipients have reported a rate of infection from 1.4% to 60%, with detection 5 times more frequent if symptoms were present (Table 1) . 6,7 Reported risks for RVI in lung transplant patients include increased calcineurin inhibitor levels, age less than 15 years, and underlying cause for transplant other than cystic fibrosis. 4, 8 As noted for SOT patients, RVIs in HSCT recipients have been well-characterized causes of significant morbidity and mortality. Reported incidences of RVI in HSCT recipients vary between 4% in earlier reports using antigen detection and culture 9 and 20% to 40% using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing (see Table 1 ). 2,10-12 Bocavirus, as mentioned earlier, also plays an unclear role in the HSCT population, with 1 report of disseminated bocavirus in a pediatric HSCT recipient. 13 Risk factors for progression to LRTI include age greater than 65 years, lymphopenia, neutropenia, alternative/nongenoidentical sibling donor, and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 10,14",

In the study from Spain mentioned earlier, LRTI was associated with significant change in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1 ]) at 1 and 3 months following infection and nested case-control analysis reported a significant association between RVI within 3 months and acute rejection (hazard ratio [HR], 6.54; confidence interval [CI], 1.47-29.08; P 5 .01). 3 Alternatively, the Swiss study with similar incidence rates found no such association. 4 CLAD compromises long-term survival following lung transplant and although an association with previous viral infection has been explored in published literature, a definitive link remains unclear. Pooled incidence rates for CLAD in the meta-analysis mentioned earlier for virus-positive cases were 18% (9 out of 50 cases) compared with 11.6% (37 out of 319) in virusnegative cases, but because of limited number of overall events a link could not be confirmed. 6 However, there are published epidemiologic links between RVI and CLAD as well as data on biologically plausible mechanisms underlying a causal relationship. 5,15-17 In addition, a recent large retrospective cohort (n 5 250) of lung transplant recipients found an independent association between RVI and development of CLAD within 3 the next months (HR, 4.8; CI, 1.9-11.6; P<.01). 18 Paulsen & Danziger-Isakov Published attributable mortality caused by LRTI in HSCT from a respiratory virus varies, up to 28% to 30% in some reports, most commonly involving influenza, RSV, adenovirus, and hMPV. 10,19 Important risk factors for mortality in the HSCT population include lymphopenia, corticosteroids (>1 mg/kg), and viral or bacterial coinfection. 11 BOS following allogeneic stem cell transplant is also associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The most recognized risk factor for BOS following HSCT is GVHD, but there is some evidence that RVIs may play a role as well. 20,21",

As noted earlier, asymptomatic viral shedding is seen frequently, including reports of asymptomatic RSV shedding in HSCT recipients for 35 to 80 days and persistent rhinovirus detection for 8 to 15 months in lung transplant recipients. 3,18,24,25 The ability of current molecular testing methods to detect virus in samples with few viral copies combined with prolonged viral shedding in SOT and HSCT recipients can create a challenge for clinicians trying to determine whether a positive molecular test indicates a true pathogen. 26 The source or sampling method used is an important consideration. Respiratory samples are routinely obtained from aspirates/washes or swabs from the nasopharynx (NP) or oropharynx (OP) as well as more invasive collection methods such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). However, the choice of upper respiratory sample collection methodology for optimal viral recovery is uncertain. In children hospitalized because of respiratory infections, sensitivity of RVI detection with NP aspirates of 86% to 100% have been reported versus nasal swab sensitivity of 67% to 95%. 27 A similar comparison of NP swabs with or without OP swabs in immunocompetent children found a higher sensitivity of NP swabs for RVI of 91% to 100%, which was greater than or equal to OP swabs (83%-98%), with combined testing increasing detection by 2% to 9%, depending on the virus. 28 Investigation in adults reported higher sensitivity with NP washes (85%) than NP swabs (73%) or OP swabs (54%), and noted that maximal sensitivity was achieved through a combination of all 3 methods. 29",

Interventions can be patient specific, such as antiviral prophylaxis following transplant and immunization both before and following transplant. For the most common RVIs, immunization is only available for influenza, as discussed later. Vaccines for many of the other RVIs are still under development and not commercially available. In addition, interventions at the level of the health care system decrease the incidence of RVI, including the appropriate use of respiratory or contact precautions, screening of visitors, and immunization of health care staff. 30,31 These interventions are included in the general US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to reduce health care-associated pneumonia. 32 Prevention of RVI in HSCT recipients is also addressed in the joint CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA), and American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation guidelines as well (http://asheducationbook.hematologylibrary. org/content/2001/1/392.long). 33 Other interventions, such as universal mask use for all health care staff and visitors on an HSCT unit, strict isolation of all patients, mandatory hand washing, and visitor restriction for children less than 12 years of age, have been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of RVIs and are used at some centers. [34] [35] [36] VIRUS-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES, PREVENTION, AND TREATMENT Respiratory Syncytial Virus Epidemiology, risk, and attributable mortality RSV has long been recognized as a concerning pathogen in immunocompromised hosts, with increased mortality if the infection involves the lower respiratory tract. 19 In the solid organ population, lung transplant recipients are at increased risk for RSV-related mortality and morbidity compared with the other organs. 37,38 Incidence of RSV in lung transplant recipients is variable and accounts for roughly 6% to 12% of RVI infections. 4 Risk factors for morbidity and mortality are not clearly defined, with reports of young age (<2 years), recent transplant, preexisting lung disorder, recent rejection, and multivisceral transplant as risk factors. 39, 40 RSV infection following HSCT depends on several factors, including patient age and type of transplant. Incidence of RSV infection following HSCT has been reported at 7% to 9% for allogeneic and 1.5% for autologous, with pediatric patients at the greatest risk of RSV. 41,42 Several risk factors have been reported for RSV as well as progression to LRTI or severe infection. In HSCT, risk factors for RSV include less than 1 month posttransplant (preengraftment), both younger (<2 years) and older (>60 years) age, GVHD, relapsed disease, and smoking. 40,43 Risks for presenting with LRTI or progression to LRTI include lack of RSV-directed therapy, high-dose total body irradiation, respiratory coinfection, absolute neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm 3 , and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) less than 100 to 200 cells/mm 3 . 42,44 In contrast, an ALC greater than 1000 cells/mm 3 was protective against progression to LRTI.",

Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the F glycoprotein of RSV, and is approved for prevention of RSV in high-risk patients less than 2 years of age. Recommendations were published in 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics for palivizumab prophylaxis for infants and children less than 24 months of age with specific predisposing conditions. 48 With respect to immunocompromised children, no specific recommendations were made, aside from considering prophylaxis in profoundly immunocompromised patients younger than 24 months of age. A more recent multidisciplinary consensus conference in Italy, referencing the lack of adequate clinical trials and statistical power, recommended against palivizumab for children with primary or acquired immunodeficiencies. 49 In practice, the use of palivizumab for RSV prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients varies widely. Approximately 50% of surveyed pediatric SOT centers used palivizumab for prophylaxis, in both candidates and recipients, with 93% of those targeting infants 0 to 12 months old and 79% extending use to 0 to 24 months. 50 Only 10% provided palivizumab for patients 2 to 4 years old and 7% gave palivizumab for patients more than 4 years of age. This variability in practice is likely caused by the limited data on the efficacy of palivizumab prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients. In a retrospective pediatric HSCT cohort from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (n 5 275), nearly half of the high-risk patients received intravenous (IV) palivizumab. In the palivizumab treatment group, 30% developed RSV compared with only 4% of those who did not receive prophylaxis. 51 Similarly, an approach limiting palivizumab only to those HSCT pediatric patients younger than 12 months with either a chronic oxygen requirement or severe combined immunodeficiency, pretransplant to 100 days posttransplant, found no increase in the incidence of RSV or patient outcomes compared with historical controls with wider use of palivizumab. 52 If time allows, delaying HSCT has also been reported to be an effective strategy to prevent serious RSV infection in HSCT candidates with RSV URTI before conditioning. 53,54 One reported strategy delayed transplant until symptom resolution and negative repeat RSV testing, resulting in a significant reduction in RSV pneumonia following transplant and improved mortality compared with those patients whose transplants were not delayed. 53 Careful thought must be given to the underlying disease process, risk of progression, as well as type of transplant before making the decision to delay HSCT.",

Reports of improved outcomes in the treatment of RSV in HSCT patients can be found for inhaled, oral, or IV ribavirin, 46,67,68 as well as combinations of ribavirin with IVIG, palivizumab, and/or RSV-specific IVIG 56 ; most support treatment at the URTI stage, before progression to LRTI. A systematic review of the available retrospective studies in 2011 reported that any form of ribavirin, alone or in combination with an immunomodulatory agent, was effective in preventing progression of URTI to LRTI, with a trend toward better outcomes with inhaled ribavirin plus an immunomodulator. 56 Although negative studies are potentially less likely to achieve publication, there are data available suggesting that adjunctive corticosteroid use and palivizumab alone do not improve outcomes. 69, 70 Complicating the assessment of RSV treatments in SOT and HSCT patients are recent reports of good outcomes with minimal intervention, such as the 54 immunocompromised pediatric patients diagnosed with symptomatic RSV without any mortality despite only 8 (15%) receiving directed therapy. 47 Another analysis of 32 pediatric HSCT recipients with RSV reported no attributable mortality with no ribavirin therapy; all patients were managed either with supportive care alone or immunoglobulin therapy. 42",

Rates of severe influenza in lung transplant patients have been reported in 16% to 20% of those infected, with an attributable mortality of 4% to 8%; even higher mortalities of 21% caused by the 2009 H1N1 infection in lung transplant recipients with preexisting BOS grade 3 were reproted. [76] [77] [78] A report of Australian lung transplant recipients with H1N1 influenza noted a 16% FEV 1 decline at presentation and 39% of patients had prolonged allograft dysfunction. 78 Reports of the most severe infections are largely based on outcomes following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic; however, a recent retrospective cohort study of Brazilian renal transplant recipients with influenza A between 2009 and 2014 reported a 14% incidence of both intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality, which is higher than expected. 79 Similar to solid organ recipients, influenza infection in HSCT patients causes significant morbidity and mortality. Progression from URTI to LRTI varies widely depending on the report, but has been found in 23% to 30% of adult HSCT patients or patients with hematologic malignancy, with overall mortality of 4% to 12%. 14,80,81 Risk factors for either presentation with LRTI or progression to LRTI include an ALC less than 100 to 200 cells/mL, lack of influenza-directed therapy, increased creatinine level, and delay in seeking care. There is a significant survival benefit if treated with influenza-directed therapy, with 9% mortality in treated patients versus 27% mortality in untreated patients. 14, 80, 81 Prevention Vaccination remains the primary focus and most strongly recommended method of influenza prevention. 82 Seasonal influenza vaccines cover either 3 or 4 strains of influenza based on antigenic characterization of the previous year's circulating strains. In general, quadrivalent vaccines cover an additional influenza B strain compared with the trivalent vaccines without interfering with vaccine response. 83 Influenza vaccines are available in inactivated (intramuscular or intradermal administration) and live, attenuated (intranasal) formulations. The live, attenuated vaccine is not recommended for immunocompromised recipients, and the inactivated vaccine is preferred for household contacts. 82, 84 Overall influenza vaccine response in SOT and HSCT patients remains variable based on the population.",

            "text": "The optimal timing of vaccination following SOT has not been precisely determined, with guidelines from the American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases Community of Practice and the IDSA recommending vaccination between 2 and 6 months after transplant. 85, 86 Reports of immunogenic response to influenza vaccine in SOT show a wide variation depending on the organ transplanted and the year assessed, with historical ranges between 15% and 93% protection. 82 Seroprotective responses have been reported between 19% and 43% in lung transplant recipients, [87] [88] [89] 19% and 55% in adult renal transplant recipients, 90 and greater than 75% in pediatric liver recipients. 91 Various adjuvants and dosing strategies have been evaluated in an effort to increase immunogenicity, with variable results. High-dose influenza vaccine contains 4 times the antigen dose of the standard influenza vaccine, and in early trials has been reported to increase the percentage of pediatric SOT patients who achieved an increase in protective titers. 92 There are several likely explanations behind the reported variability in response, including the organ transplanted, duration of time from transplant, and degree of immunosuppression. The impact of immunosuppression on immunogenicity shows mycophenolate mofetil as most consistently associated with a decrease in response, whereas sirolimus has been associated with an increase in vaccine responsiveness. 87, 93 Because of concerns about the potential development of human leukocyte antigen alloantibodies following the adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine, evaluations of acute rejection following influenza immunization have been conducted. [94] [95] [96] A subsequent postauthorization safety study following the 2009/2010 pH1N1 vaccine found no increased risk of acute rejection associated with vaccination. 97 Further, seasonal influenza immunization from 2006 to 2009 also found no increased risk of acute rejection. 98 Similar to SOT patients, influenza immunization is recommended for HSCT recipients and is less effective compared with healthy controls. Again, response rates to influenza in HSCT vary based on time from transplant, influenza season/year studied, and degree of immunosuppression. Rates of seroconversion of 30% to 40% are typical. 99, 100 In addition, there are encouraging reports of increased immunogenicity with high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine compared with standard dose. 101 Although inactivated influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for SOT and HSCT recipients, other approaches have been suggested to prevent infection. In addition to use for treatment of influenza, oseltamivir and zanamivir are also approved for influenza chemoprophylaxis. A prospective study, predominantly in adult SOT recipients, found that daily oseltamivir for 12 weeks during seasonal influenza circulation significantly reduced the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza as determined by reverse transcription PCR. 102 Oseltamivir, given for 7 to 10 days, has also been reported to be effective in prevention of influenza infection in a hematology/HSCT inpatient unit during a nosocomial H1N1 outbreak. 103 Treatment Early treatment with antiviral drugs has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce hospital admissions and mechanical ventilation use. 77, 80, 81, 104 The mainstay of treatment of influenza are the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir. The influenza A M2 protein inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine are active against influenza A only, but are no longer recommended because of significant resistance in circulating influenza strains. 76 Literature on the treatment of influenza in SOT and HSCT are reliably reproducible with maximum benefit seen the earlier in the course that virus-specific therapy is initiated. 81 During the 2009 pandemic H1N1 season, SOT recipients treated with antiviral agents within 48 hours of symptom onset were significantly less likely (8% vs 22%) to require ICU admission. 77 Although treatment within 24 to 48 hours is optimal, benefit has been shown even with delayed treatment. 80 Most experts therefore endorse influenza-specific antiviral treatment of SOT and HSCT patients with influenza at any point in their illness.",

            "text": "Oseltamivir is an oral NAI indicated for the treatment of influenza A and B in adults and children more than 2 weeks of age. Recommended duration of treatment is 5 days in immunocompetent children and adults. In general, treatment recommendations and practice in SOT patients with influenza are for 5 days of oseltamivir as well. 105, 106 Although 5 days of oseltamivir is the typical treatment duration, there are reports of treatment for 10 days or longer in patients with persistent symptoms. 107 A clinical trial also investigated conventional-dose versus doubledose oseltamivir for 10 days in immunocompromised patients, with no results yet released (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00545532). Zanamivir is an inhaled NAI approved for treatment of influenza A and B in adults and children 7 years of age and older. Zanamivir is used less frequently than oral oseltamivir, likely because of the delivery route and rare reports of inhaled zanamivir failure. 108 Peramivir is active against influenza A and B and currently is the only IV NAI approved for clinical use in patients aged 18 years and older. IV formulations of both zanamivir and oseltamivir are under investigation in clinical trials. 109, 110 There is generally less experience with peramivir compared with oral oseltamivir, but published reports of clinical effectiveness and reduction in viral load are encouraging. Peramivir is a viable treatment option, especially in those patients in whom oral or inhaled antivirals are not the optimal route. 111, 112 The pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza strain was also notable for an increased frequency of NAI resistance in up to 14% of strains. 113 However, NAI resistance is currently uncommon, with an overall incidence of 0.5% to 1.9% of isolates, but does remain an area of growing concern. 114 The most frequent neuraminidase mutation is the H275Y substitution, which results in highlevel oseltamivir resistance, reduced peramivir susceptibility, and generally preserved zanamivir activity. 110, 114 Options for oseltamivir-resistant influenza are limited. Inhaled zanamivir may have activity in many, but not all, cases. Peramivir has been reported to be effective in patients with oseltamivir-resistant influenza and has shown encouraging results in preventing lethality in mouse models of NAI-resistant H5N1/avian influenza models. 115,116 DAS181 (Ansun BioPharma, San Diego, CA) is a recombinant fusion protein that removes the sialic acid receptor for influenza binding and entry into the cell, potentially inhibiting influenza and parainfluenza infection. DAS181 has shown promising in vitro results of activity against oseltamivir-resistant influenza strains, and additional testing versus several NAI-resistant strains is ongoing. 117, 118 Aside from advances in supportive care, no specific adjunctive therapies are routinely recommended. Corticosteroids have been shown to decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and progression to LRTI but at the cost of prolonged viral shedding. 80 Therefore, although corticosteroids are not routinely recommended, if corticosteroids are indicated for another reason, such as rejection or GVHD, worsening infection with influenza is not clear reason to withhold steroids.",

            "text": "Epidemiology, risk, and attributable mortality Adenovirus is a double-stranded DNA virus made up of 52 immunologically distinct types, with serotypes 1 and 2 most commonly associated with pneumonia. 119 In nonimmunocompromised patients, adenovirus typically causes self-limited disease, such as URI, conjunctivitis, and/or gastroenteritis. Adenovirus infection in immunocompromised patients can range from asymptomatic viremia to significant localized or disseminated disease. In contrast with many of the other community-acquired respiratory viruses, adenoviral infection can occur from primary acquisition or through reactivation of virus. In 1 study, viral reactivation was linked to the timing of immune reconstitution and CD41 T-cell counts. 120 Depending on patient factors, clinical disease in immunocompromised patients can include pneumonia, hepatitis, colitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and encephalitis. 5 In a 1993 to 2006 retrospective cohort of RVIs in pediatric SOT, HSCT, and oncology patients, adenoviral infection was associated with the greatest length of stay, and was the only specific virus that increased the risk of morbidity and mortality related to RVI (odds ratio, 3.7; CI, 1.1-12.6; P 5 .03). 1 Adenoviral infections have been reported in renal, liver, small bowel, lung, and heart transplant recipients, and although most are asymptomatic, they can be associated with severe disease. [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] Although adenoviral infection in HSCT is more likely to cause severe disease than in SOT, there are reports of graft infection and rejection with adenovirus in essentially all SOT populations. 123, 127, 128 Infection in lung recipients is common (up to 22% in 1 series) and there are multiple reports of severe infection, including graft loss, progression to BOS, and death. 125, [129] [130] [131] [132] Infection in HSCT recipients can be severe and associated with significant mortality. In 14 adult HSCT recipients with adenovirus viremia, most of whom were treated with antivirals, almost 50% developed invasive adenoviral disease and 23% died of the infection. 133 Adenoviral LRTI and disseminated disease generally carry the greatest mortality in pediatric and HSCT patients (up to 80% in some reports). [134] [135] [136] Treatment Treatment options for adenoviral infection or disease are limited because there are currently no approved antiviral agents for treatment. Reports of recovery with reduced immune suppression alone make the need for therapy and optimal timing for intervention uncertain. 124 As for most viral infections in SOT and HSCT patients, immunosuppression reduction is recommended if possible. Cidofovir, approved for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, has been the most common antiviral used for treatment. Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral DNA polymerase with broad antiviral activity against DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses and adenovirus. Although cidofovir has in vitro activity against adenovirus and is generally accepted as the standard of care, cidofovir treatment efficacy is controversial. 135, 137, 138 Dosing of cidofovir is generally 5 mg/kg IV once every 7 days, or 1 mg/kg IV 3 times per week, often in conjunction with probenecid and hydration. 129 Cidofovir nephrotoxicity, which is not dose dependent, is the most common reason for discontinuation of therapy. 137 Alternative therapies, including ribavirin and combination cidofovir plus IVIG, have been reported with limited data, and these are not routinely recommended for use. 119, 122, 139 Investigational adenovirus therapies Because of new antiviral development and alternative treatment modalities, there may be additional options in the future. Brincidofovir is an orally bioavailable lipid conjugate of cidofovir that has potent in vitro activity against adenovirus, and has shown promising results for both treatment of serious invasive adenovirus infections and asymptomatic viremia. 140, 141 Recognizing the vital role of T-cell immunity in control of viral infections and the loss of this immunity during HSCT and SOT, the use of adoptive T-cell immunity is promising as well. Adoptive T-cell immunity uses donor virus-specific T-cells to treat infection, and has been reported to be safe and effective when performed early in the course of the infection. 134, 142 Adoptive T-cell transfer has generally been limited to a few centers and predominantly in HSCT recipients, because of both the time and the expertise needed for cell preparation, but more recent methods may allow shorter generation time and more access to this therapy. 143, 144 Parainfluenza Epidemiology, risk factors, and attributable mortality Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus with 4 distinct serotypes (types 1-4). Serotypes vary in seasonality and disease, with PIV3 associated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis, and year-round activity that peaks in spring and summer. PIV1 and PIV2 are commons causes of pediatric laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) and typically peak in fall and winter. 5 PIV4 infection is rarely associated with disease.",

Parainfluenza infections presented more commonly as URTI with or without LRTI symptoms, and less frequently as LRTI alone. 1 Although there are previous reports of significant mortality in SOT recipients caused by PIV (up to 15% in 1 series 145 ), more recent publications in lung and other organ recipients report decreased mortality. 8, 146 Retrospective reports place the incidence of PIV infection following HSCT between 2% and 7%, with greater incidence in children than in adults. [147] [148] [149] LRTI after HSCT is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for LRTI caused by PIV are lymphopenia (<300 cells/mm 3 ), neutropenia (<500 cells/mL), APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score greater than 15, myeloablative conditioning, high-dose corticosteroids for GVHD, and coinfection. 104, 150 Reported risk factors for mortality in HSCT include LRTI, early infection, mismatched related donor, APACHE II score greater than 15, new oxygen requirement at diagnosis, low monocyte counts (<100 cell/mL), and high-dose steroid use (>2 mg/kg/d). 149, 151, 152 In a series of 28 HSCT patients with PIV LRTI, mechanical ventilation was necessary in 29% and attributable mortality was 46%. 150 Other recent publications report 17% to 37% mortality in HSCT recipients with probable or proven parainfluenza LRTI. 149, 151, 152 Treatment There are no currently FDA-approved antiviral treatments for parainfluenza disease. Treatment is supportive and includes reduction in immunosuppression. Ribavirin and/or IVIG have been used, off label, in parainfluenza infections with variable results and no definitive evidence of efficacy. 147, [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] Investigational parainfluenza virus therapies DAS181, as discussed previously for NAI-resistant influenza, can potentially inhibit PIV binding to respiratory epithelial cells. DAS181 is an inhaled treatment typically administered via a dry powder inhaler for 5 to 10 days, and has been used under compassionate use and clinical trial protocols in HSCT and SOT recipients, including 2 lung transplant patients. In published reports, DAS181 has shown encouraging results, including reduction in PIV quantitative viral load and overall outcomes. [156] [157] [158] [159] In addition, there are intriguing studies examining the impact of cholesterol reducing agents such as gemfibrozil and lovastatin on disrupting viral assembly in PIV, RSV, and influenza. 160 Reports of parainfluenza-specific T-cell generation from healthy donors may also ultimately lead to effective adoptive T-cell therapy for PIV. 161 ",

There are reports in lung transplant recipients of oral ribavirin resulting in quicker return to baseline and decreased incidence of subsequent BOS, and case reports of survival with IV and inhaled ribavirin. 170, 171 However, most reports are from small single-centered studies and do not include a control population. In addition, other studies have not been able identify a similar beneficial effect of ribavirin for hMPV treatment. 167, 172 Investigational human metapneumovirus therapies Adoptive T-cell transfer has not yet been achieved, but hMPV-specific T cells have been generated, with further work ongoing. 173 There are also reports in vitro and in mouse models of a human monoclonal antibody for prophylactic and therapeutic hMPV infections. 174 Cytomegalovirus Epidemiology, risk factors, and attributable mortality Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a b-herpesvirus well recognized as a significant pathogen in immunocompromised patients. CMV has been reported to affect from 12% to 80% of heart and lung transplant recipients and 50% of HSCT patients. [175] [176] [177] Although CMV can cause a wide array of infections, from asymptomatic to tissue-invasive disease, CMV pneumonitis/pneumonia is of particular concern for thoracic transplant recipients. The diagnosis of proven CMV pneumonitis is based on compatible clinical signs and/or symptoms and documented CMV in lung tissue. Traditionally, tissue-invasive CMV is based on histopathologic or immunohistochemical (IHC) findings consistent with tissue invasion on biopsy. 178, 179 CMV cultures or quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing of tissue samples are difficult to interpret because a positive finding could indicate tissue-invasive disease, shedding in the setting of active viremia, or both. 178 Recent updates to the definition of CMV pneumonia now include proven, probable, and possible CMV pneumonia. Proven disease still relies on identification of viral antigens or inclusion bodies via immunohistochemistry in biopsy material, but probable CMV pneumonia is defined as compatible symptoms plus CMV detection via viral isolation, culture, or quantitation of CMV DNA in BAL fluid. 180 There is no definitive cutoff for CMV DNA load in the setting of CMV pneumonia; however, some reports suggest greater than 500 to 5500 IU/mL as a possible cutoff. 180, 181 Possible CMV pneumonia has been suggested based on positive quantitative PCR performed on biopsy tissue.",

Risk stratification in organ transplant recipients relies heavily on donor and recipient CMV serologic results before transplant. Donors who are CMV immunoglobulin (Ig) G positive (D1) paired with recipients who are IgG negative (R\u00c0) are considered the highest risk group. Recipients who are CMV D\u00c0/R\u00c0 are generally considered low risk, although community-acquired infection can occur posttransplant, and R1 patients are variably classified as intermediate-risk or high-risk, often center dependent. Recommended duration of prophylaxis varies based on organ system and risk stratification. For D1/R\u00c0 heart transplant recipients, the recommended minimum duration of CMV prophylaxis is between 3 and 6 months. For D1/R\u00c0 lung transplant recipients the minimum recommended duration is between 6 and 12 months, with some advocates for longer, even indefinite, prophylaxis. Centers using indefinite prophylaxis for lung transplant recipients report low incidence of CMV infection, which must be balanced against reports of association between GCV-resistant CMV and prolonged CMV prophylaxis, with an incidence of 10% to 50% GCV-resistant infection in some cases. 177, 189, 190 For R1 recipients the minimum duration in lung is 6 months, and 3 months in heart recipients. In D\u00c0/R\u00c0 populations the routine use of CMV prophylaxis is not generally recommended. 178 There are several published reports of potential benefit to the addition or sole use of CMVIg for prophylaxis, but, because of the limited data to support routine use, the addition of CMVIg is not routinely recommended. 178, 191 The most recent consensus guidelines note that some experts add CMVIg for intermediate and higher-risk recipients, but there are no randomized studies indicating that CMVIg is any better than GCV or valganciclovir alone.",

Lower incidences of CMV infection are reported in patients treated with regimens including a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.

Letermovir interacts with UL56, a component of viral DNA cleavage and packaging, and has been reported to be effective in reducing CMV infection in HSCT recipients and reducing viral load in SOT patients. 207, 208 Maribavir is a competitive inhibitor of UL97 that failed to show noninferiority of CMV prevention in liver transplant patients and HSCT recipients, but is currently under investigation for use in CMV infections that are refractory to GCV, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02931539). 209, 210 Brincidofovir, referenced earlier for adenovirus, has been shown to reduce CMV events compared with placebo in HSCT recipients. 211 In addition, adoptive T-cell therapy for CMV disease has been reported to be effective in a lung transplant recipient and as well as in several HSCT recipients. [212] [213] [214] Herpes Simplex Virus and Varicella Zoster Virus HSV1 and HSV2 are a-herpesviruses and common causes of infection in immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons. In immunocompromised patients, HSV can cause a wide variety of clinical infection from asymptomatic oropharyngeal shedding to mucocutaneous and disseminated disease, including pneumonitis. HSV pneumonitis is uncommon in the era of antiviral prophylaxis, but thoracic transplant and HSCT recipients are reportedly at greatest risk. [215] [216] [217] Similar to CMV pneumonitis, the recommended diagnostic test for HSV pneumonitis is tissue histopathology with IHC for HSV. Positive BAL PCR testing for HSV may represent contamination or oropharyngeal shedding. 218 IV acyclovir is the treatment of choice for severe, disseminated HSV, including pneumonitis. It is recommended to continue IV acyclovir until resolution, or 14 days, at which time oral medication may be given. 218 VZV, another herpesvirus, can also cause significant disease in SOT and HSCT recipients. The most common manifestations of VZV are primary varicella, or chickenpox, in susceptible seronegative patients or herpes zoster, or shingles, in those with previous VZV infection or vaccination. 219 Visceral dissemination is more common in HSCT and less common in SOT. Disseminated disease includes infection of lung tissue resulting in VZV pneumonia with significant morbidity and mortality. 220, 221 Risk of dissemination is increased in acute and chronic GVHD, as well as increased immunosuppresion. 219, 220 IV acyclovir is also the recommended treatment of disseminated or invasive VZV for at least 7 days, and potentially longer in patients with extensive involvement. 219 ",
