            "text": "Background: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been shown to cause respiratory infection, accounting for approximately 7% of all such disease, and contributes to the development of asthma in humans. HMPV has a worldwide distribution with infectivity rates approaching 100%, and immunocompromised patients are particularly at risk from viral exposure. No anti-HMPV vaccine is available and diagnosis is primarily based on in-house molecular or serological tests, in part due to limited availability of recombinant HMPV antigens. Objective: To generate a panel of HMPV-derived recombinant antigens, develop standardised ELISA systems for HMPV IgG detection and explore the nature of B cell memory against HMPV to underpin future vaccine studies. Study design: HMPV viral RNA was isolated from a clinical specimen and RT-PCR was conducted. The HMPV M and P genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The HMPV N gene was cloned and expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Each purified recombinant antigens was subsequently employed in HMPV-specific ELISA. Results: High-level expression, and purification, of both HMPV matrix (M) (10 mg/g cells) and phosphoprotein (P) (3.82 mg/g cells) were achieved in an E. coli expression system. Recombinant HMPV (N) was successfully expressed in, and purified from the baculovirus expression system. Overall, a 99% HMPV IgG seroprevalence was observed (n = 96) using HMPV M-, N-and P-ELISA, respectively. The M antigen proved to be the most diagnostically useful with 99% of specimens tested exhibiting anti-M protein reactivity. A high correlation was observed between anti-M and N IgG reactivity (r = 0.96), with significant correlation also evident for anti-N and P IgG reactivity (r = 0.74). Lowest correlation was evident for anti-M and P IgG reactivity (r = 0.57). Finally, the first demonstration of HMPV-specific B cell memory (ranging 1-15 spot forming cells (SFC)/million cells) was achieved against M and P antigens in 40% of individuals tested. Conclusion: This work describes robust diagnostic systems for HMPV and new insight into antigen-specific B cell memory against HMPV.",

            "text": "Viral respiratory diseases are a major health problem. They affect people of all ages and exert a great economic impact on the health care system. The viruses most often associated with respiratory tract illness include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus. In 2001, Van den Hoogen and colleagues first reported the discovery of a new respiratory virus (human metapneumovirus, HMPV) in the Netherlands. 1 Serological studies have revealed that virtually all children have been exposed to HMPV by the age of 5 years. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Similar studies seem to support this hypothesis. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] However, in other case studies HMPV infections have been reported in the elderly [11] [12] [13] [14] and immunocompromised individuals, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] which suggests that the virus is not strictly limited to infecting infants or children. Since its discovery, the occurrence of HMPV has been reported in many countries, such as Australia, Canada, Finland, United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, Israel and Japan. It is now thought to be prevalent worldwide, indicating that it is a common and ubiquitous human pathogen. [20] [21] [22] The clinical manifestations of HMPV include tachypnea; rhinorrhea; nasal congestion; cough; fever; hypoxia; pharyngitis; hyperinflation; peribronchial cuffing; wheezing; bronchiolitis; pneumonia and respiratory failure. [23] [24] [25] Earlier recognition of this virus was delayed because it had been difficult to detect in cell 1386-6532/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A sero-epidemiological survey using these HMPV recombinant antigen-based ELISA systems was employed to determine the prevalence of antibodies to specific HMPV proteins in Ireland. The total antibody reactivity to HMPV M, P and N antigens correlated well, in particular there was significant correlation between the seroreactivity observed in both the M and N ELISA systems, (r = 0.96; Table 3 ). The correlation between the presence of HMPV antibodies determined by the M and P ELISAs was lower (r = 0.57) compared to the correlation between HMPV M and N ELISAs. Significant correlation was also observed between the N and P ELISAs (r = 0.74). The lack of correlation between the M and P protein-based ELISA systems may be due to variable levels of IgG to each recombinant antigen within the selected donor cohort. Ishiguro et al. tested for specific antibodies against nucleocapsid (N) and matrix (M) proteins in 97 sera by Western blot using recombinant N and M proteins of HMPV expressed in E. coli. 33 The results were compared with those of immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) based on HMPV-infected LLC-MK2 cells, which expressed the whole HMPV proteome. Their results indicated that the antibodies against N and M proteins are highly specific (100%) but less sensitive (42.1%, N protein; 40.8%, M protein) than those against whole proteins of HMPV detected by IFA. This would also suggest that a multi-HMPV antigen ELISA would increase the sensitivity of the detection of HMPV antibodies within human sera. However, the lower detection of P antigen-specific IgG may be due to the relatively low percentage sequence identity between HPMV P (from the A2 genotype) and genotypes A1 B1/2, respectively. 34 The HMPV genotype A2 proteins (M, P and N from ROI135) used in this study exhibited 97. (Table 4 ). Extensive validation of the HMPV ELISA systems described herein, whereby antigen coating on microtitre plates was optimised (2, 3 and 5 g/ml for HMPV M, P and N, respectively) and assay reproducibility, in terms of % coefficient of variation, was determined to be 5.5, 8 and 8%, respectively, preclude sub-optimal assay performance as a reason for the observed differences in antibody detection. In summary, recombinant M, P and N proteins of HMPV were antigenic, and the responses to M, P, and N proteins differed across the study population. Assays based on multiple antigens provided higher sensitivities than assays based on single antigens.",

Besides antibodies, long-term memory B and T cell immunity might play an important role in protection against HMPV. In some individuals, high antibody levels with low or no numbers of memory B cells were found. This strengthens the idea that longlived plasma cells maintain antibody levels and that memory B cells are a distinct population of cells. Memory B cells do not secrete antibodies prior to activation. Upon renewed antigen stimulation, memory B cells may rapidly respond, proliferate and differentiate in antibody secreting cells. The ongoing circulation of HMPV among the Irish population causing antigenic re-challenge might explain the low correlation between circulating HMPV-specific memory B cells and antibody levels measured in our study. Importantly, in some individuals no HMPV-specific memory B cells, as well as low HMPV-specific antibody levels, were detectable which might result in a higher susceptibility for infection with HMPV.",
