            "text": "There has been significant progress in our knowledge about the relationship between infectious disease and the immune system in relation to asthma, but many unanswered questions still remain. Respiratory tract infections such as those caused by respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus during the first two years of life are still clearly associated with later wheezing and asthma, but the mechanism has not been completely worked out. Is there an 'infectious march' triggered by infection in infancy that progresses to disease pathology or are infants who contract respiratory infections predisposed to developing asthma? This review focuses on the common themes in the interaction between microbes and the immune system and presents a critical appraisal of the evidence to date. The various mechanisms whereby microbes alter the immune response and how this might influence asthma are discussed along with new and promising clinical practices for prevention and therapy. Recent advances in utilizing sensitive PCR detection methods have allowed more rigorous testing of the causality hypothesis of virus infection leading to asthma, but the evidence is still equivocal. Various exceptions and inconsistencies in the clinical trials are discussed in light of new guidelines for subject inclusion/exclusion in hopes of providing some standardization. In spite of past failures in vaccination and disappointing results of some clinical trials, the new strategies for prophylaxis including RNA interference and targeted delivery of microbicides offer a large dose of hope to a world suffering from an increasing incidence of asthma and a huge burden of healthcare cost and loss of quality of life.",

Other respiratory viruses and certain atypical bacteria are also suspected of playing a part in airway inflammation and asthma pathogenesis [8, 9] . In this chapter we will explore the mechanisms by which viral and bacterial infections trigger asthma exacerbations looking for similarities and differences and discuss how some new therapeutic strategies are attempting to target these areas.",

            "text": "Advances in biotechnology in the 1990s have now provided diagnosticians with ultrasensitive methods such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identifying respiratory tract pathogens [10, 11] . Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [12] and high-throughput microarray chips, such as the Virochip [13] have increased data collection by orders of magnitude. Early epidemiological studies frequently suffered from variable viral isolation rates [14] and had to rely on tissue culture and serology for the detection of HRV, RSV, human influenza virus (IF), human parainfluenzavirus (HPIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), enterovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae [15] , pneumococcal strains, and Hemophilus influenzae [16, 17] . Microbial pathogens are usually more abundant in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from children and adults with active asthma [17] [18] [19] . Due to technological limitations and variable clinical criteria for diagnosing asthma [14] , observations from some early studies showed only weak correlations between respiratory infections and wheezy bronchitis and asthma [20] . Total viral isolation rates of RSV, HRV, HPIV in children under the age of 15 were as low as 14.2% (38/267 children) [18] to as high as 45% (22/72 children) [17] during hospital admissions or reported asthma attacks. In spite of the limitations, these early studies identified important factors that influence certain virus isolation rates, like patient readmission status and season of illness [18] , sensitivity of detection method [14] , environmental exposures such as parental smoking [21] and patient age [22] . The controversial question of whether viral infections cause asthma exacerbations or if the asthma phenotype enhances susceptibility to infectious disease was still not answered.",

Despite the lack of high-tech tools such as PCR and microarrays, the extensive study found that HRV, HPIV, and RSV were the predominant infectious agents in 614 isolates. RSV infection was highest among children less than four years of age and occurred most often during winter months, while HRV illnesses occurred at all seasons and ages. Recent reports that utilize PCR and more sensitive methods generally confirm the findings of the Roehampton study [7, 24, 25] . The frequent detection of respiratory tract pathogens during acute lower respiratory bronchitis [26, 27] suggests microbial pathogens trigger airway inflammation and stimulate leukocyte infiltration. More importantly, certain populations of children wheeze after a viral infection but show no symptoms of wheeze between viral infections, suggesting an immediate correlation between asthmatic phenotype and respiratory infections [28] . Although a multitude of factors, such as genetics, environment, weather, and atopic sensitization, could trigger asthma attacks, microbial pathogens have a potential for contributing to both persistent and episodic asthma attacks.",

In Perth, Australia, Kusel et al. followed 236 infants from birth to their first year of life to assess the incidence of acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) of viral or bacterial origin. Collecting NPA samples and using PCR for viral detection, the Perth study identified HRV, RSV, HCoV, PIV, and IF as the predominant respiratory pathogens associated with ARIs [29] . In control children, who were healthy and asymptomatic, 24% of the NPA samples were positive for viral agent, while viruses were present in 69% of the infected children. HRV was the most frequent virus identified with all three forms of ARI, including upper (URI), lower without wheeze (nwLRI), and lower respiratory illness with wheeze (wLRI). The attributable risk associated with wLRI, which is a measure of the degree to which a specific pathogen contributes to the severity of the respiratory illness, was highest for HRV and RSV, at 39% and 12% respectively [29] . In a five-year follow-up of the original Perth birth cohort, HRV-and RSV-associated wheeze with LRI were correlated with statistical significance to current-or persistent-wheeze and current-asthma later in life [7] . Skin prick tests helped categorize the remaining 198 children into the following groups: never atopic, atopic by age of two years, or atopic after two years. Combining ARI histories and status of atopic sensitization, children who were atopic by age two and had acquired wLRI HRV-infections were found to have the greatest likelihood of developing wheeze by age five. Odds ratios associated with this group nearly doubled when more than one wLRI was reported. The cohort studies by Kusel et al. provide evidence that HRV-induced wLRI and early sensitization are risk factors for current and persistent wheeze and asthma by the age of five [7] .",

Among 259 children examined in the study known as Childhood Origins of ASThma (COAST) in Madison, Wisconsin [30] , 73 children developed childhood asthma by their sixth year. Wheezing illnesses attributed to either HRV or RSV in their third year of life increased their risk of developing asthma by age six; in particular, 90% of children who had wheezy HRVinduced illness by age three subsequently became asthmatic by age six. HRV-induced wheezing observed within the first, second, and third years of life increased the risk for asthma by the age of six and led to the conclusion that rhinovirus-associated illnesses during infancy are early predictors of subsequent development of asthma by age six. In agreement with Kusel et al. [7] and Stein et al. [31] , respiratory illnesses without wheeze were not statistically correlated with the development of asthma at age six. A number of longitudinal studies implicated HRV as a prominent viral pathogen in asthma etiology.",

Reference source not found. and Table 2 summarize the study designs, population groups, and types of respiratory tract pathogens isolated in international clinical studies of adults and children from the 1970s to the current time. Four Swedish cohort studies conducted by Sigurs et al. prospectively followed 46 children from infancy until the age of 18 [27, [32] [33] [34] . Compared to 92 age-matched control subjects, exposure to RSV was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of asthma (39% in RSV-exposed vs. 9% in controls), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis at age 13 [27] (39% in RSVexposed vs. 15% in controls), and sensitization to allergens by age 18 [34] (41% in RSVexposed vs. 14% in controls). The occurrence of RSV-induced bronchiolitis within the first year of life was associated with the development of asthma at ages 7 and 13. A two-year prospective study conducted in Finland using PCR detection methods identified RSV, HRV, and other viruses as the major etiological agents in acute expiratory wheeze in 293 hospitalized children, from 3 months to 16 years of age [35] . Among the cases of acute expiratory wheezing, 88% involved a single respiratory virus while coinfection with several different viruses comprised 19% of all cases. The study found noticeable age-dependent variations in viral agent prevalence: RSV infects children less than 11 months of age more than other age groups, whereas enteroviruses and HRV are most prevalent in children \u226512 months old [35] . Unfortunately, no screening for atypical bacteria was performed to assess the prevalence of C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae.",

Differences between the Swedish and Tucson study designs may account for the discrepancy in results at age 13. The Tucson questionnaire study enrolled healthy children in the first year of life, while the Swedish study investigated primarily infants, less than six months old, who were hospitalized for RSV-induced bronchiolitis. Consequently, the Swedish study examined incidences of severe RSV-induced respiratory illnesses that resulted in enhanced airway obstruction and limited airway function. Furthermore, the Tucson study utilized immunofluorescence and viral culturing without PCR and this may have resulted in missed detection of viral pathogens. For example, children who acquired virus-negative LRI before the age of three were found to have an increased risk of frequent wheeze at age eight compared to healthy controls [31] ; moreover, LRIs caused by other agents, including rhinovirus, contributed a low proportion (14.4%) of the 472 reported LRIs and were not statistically correlated with frequent wheeze after age three. These findings conflict with studies that identified HRV as the predominant cause of wheezy LRI in children range ages of 6-17 [8, 26, 30, 37] or reports that found relatively low PCR detection of the atypical respiratory bacteria, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, in children [15, 38] . Despite the design differences, the Sweden, Finland, and Tucson clinical studies all implicate RSV as an important pathogen in the subsequent development of early childhood asthma.",

HRV illness are usually noticeable within the first three days, accompanied by symptoms of the common cold, including nasal congestion, cough, sneezing, headaches, and sore throat [48] . Replication in epithelial cells occurs optimally at temperatures from 33 to 35\u00b0C, which lead investigators to consider HRV exclusively as an etiological agent of upper respiratory tract infections. Recent evidence, however, indicates that HRV is equally as important as a lower respiratory tract pathogen [6, 7] . Symptoms of HRV infection often persist in the lower airways of adults [49] and the elderly [50] , yet evidence supporting the hypothesis that HRV causes chronic infections is limited since early longitudinal studies failed to identify HRV serotypes. Therefore, it is still unclear whether persistent HRV-induced ARIs result from chronic or new infections with different serotypes [51] . In support of the argument that HRVs do not cause chronic infections, a follow-up evaluation of the COAST study participants found consecutive, recurrent HRV infections with the same serotype to be uncommon [52] . Since a large number of serotypes recirculate in populations, reinfection with the same serotype is unlikely. Similar to other highly diverse viral pathogens, antigenic diversity could serve as a means for evading adaptive immunity [51] .",

Although less prominent than the reports about HRV or RSV, longitudinal studies examining asthma exacerbations consistently recover and detect by PCR [15] the atypical bacteria, Chlamydophila pneumoniae [80, 81] and Mycobacterium pneumoniae [82] . C. pneumoniae, an etiological agent of atypical pneumonia, is detectable by serology, culture, antigen detection, and complement fixation, and is found in 2-11% of cases of acute exacerbation in children [7, 15, 37, 83] . Infections with C. pneumoniae have been reported as high as 86% in adults when PCR detection was used [9] . Similarly, M. pneumoniae contributes to 5.7-28.4 % of pneumonia infections and is the predominant cause of tracheobronchitis [84] . As likely agents of chronic respiratory infection, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae have been found to possess numerous mechanisms for disrupting innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immune responses.",

            "text": "Cellular responses-Most HRV serotypes and RSV strains cause little cellular injury to bronchial epithelial cells in culture compared to infections with influenza A virus [85, 86] . Some epithelial cell necrosis occurs and cellular debris accumulates in severe RSV infections [87] , but the majority of HRV-and RSV-induced pathology is attributed to indirect stimulation of host innate and adaptive immune cells. In vitro culture assays and animal model systems have been vital resources for studying disease pathogenesis. Unfortunately for us, primate cells are selectively permissive to a large number of HRV serotypes. Cells from rodents and other mammals lack the primate ICAM-1 receptor for HRV absorption and thus do not support the replication of the 90% of serotypes defined as the major-group [58] . This has hindered studies of major-group HRV in vivo using animal models. Rodent cells are semi-permissive to the remaining 10% (minor-group). Consequently, a minor-type rhinovirus-1B strain was used to develop rhinovirus 1B-induced asthma exacerbations in BALB/c mice [88] . Because RSV infections are relatively inefficient in adult rodents, high viral loads of RSV (10 5 -10 7 pfu) are required to produce pathological changes through intranasal [89] [90] [91] or intratracheal [87] inoculation. Despite some limitations, the murine models of virus-induced asthma exacerbation have provided a great deal of information regarding HRV and RSV pathogenesis.",

Surprisingly, cellular profiles after RV16 inoculation do not differ greatly among atopic asthmatics or nonatopic subjects [100] .

No significant groupspecific differences were observed in peak nasal viral titers or cold symptom scores. Bronchial biopsies from HRV-infected asthma patients display T-cell infiltration at the site of infection [101] , yet similar infiltration was absent in HRV-infected subjects without asthma [99] . Gern et al. also observed elevated secretion of the neutrophil chemotaxin, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IP-10 and MIP-2 in the sputum samples of infected asthma patients [97, 100, 102] .

As of June 2010, only two reports used GMPquality wild-type RSV A2 in human experimental infections [106, 107] . Healthy young adults from ages 18 to 45 were inoculated through nostril instillation with either a high (4.7 log 10 TCID 50 ) or a low (3.7 log 10 TCID 50 ) RSV dose and observed for 28 days. While neither control nor inoculated subjects demonstrated severe illness symptoms or lower respiratory disease with cough, shortness of breath or wheezing, the eight subjects given high doses and the five subjects given low doses shed virus for one to eight days after inoculation [106] . Inoculated individuals exhibited mild systemic illness, with fever, chills, and fatigue, but respiratory symptoms remained localized to the upper respiratory tract. The study specifically measured viral titers and levels of viral proteins F and G, but did not report infiltrating cell profiles; thus, cellularity associated with experimental RSV A2 inoculation in humans was not directly comparable with that in murine or in vitro studies. Nasal and bronchial lavages from earlier clinical studies provide evidence that the infiltrating cell and chemokine profiles of RSV-infected patients are similar to those in HRV-infected murine models and human subjects [93] . Neutrophils are abundant in the nasal lavages of RSV-infected adults and infants [108] and in response to RSV-infection, early cytokines and chemokines, like IL-12, IL-18, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-8, and RANTES, are upregulated in the upper respiratory tract [87, [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] . Lastly, detectable levels of eosinophils and factors associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation like eosinophil cationic protein and eotaxin, were observed to be highest among infants with RSVbronchiolitis compared to control and non-RSV bronchiolitis [114] .",

            "text": "The significance of eosinophils in virus-induced asthma is widely debated, since eosinophils are often prevalent in areas of epithelial damage [104, 115, 116] and likely contribute to eosinophilic inflammation [117, 118] . Conversely, observations from murine models demonstrate a protective role for eosinophils [119] in viral clearance through secretion of ribonucleases and other antiviral factors [120] . Eosinophil degranulation and release of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) has been shown in vitro to be enhanced by the presence of viruses in coculture experiments with antigen-presenting cells (macrophage or dendritic cells) and CD4+ T-cells [121] . Davoine et al. demonstrated that the addition of HRV, RSV, or HPIV resulted in elevated EPO and/or leukotriene release. Additionally, HRV and RSV stimulated production of IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of dendritic cells and T-cells when eosinophils were absent. Other reports suggest that eosinophilia and secretion of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) or RANTES are potential predictors of asthma and disease severity [122] [123] [124] ; consequently, virus-induced eosinophilia may play a significant role in asthma exacerbations.",

IRF1 is important in apoptosis and activates Th1 responses while suppressing inappropriate Th2 responses [132] . IFN-regulatory factors have been shown to regulate Tcell differentiation [133] and type-1 IFNs influence dendritic cell maturation [134] and Th1/ Th2 cytokine production. Impairment of type-1 IFN or IRF1 expression and subsequent Th1 differentiation could result in a Th2-like inflammatory disease [135, 136] . Alternatively, the RSV G protein may disrupt the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance. The secreted form of G (sG) contains a domain that mimics the chemokine CX3C [137] and induces production of IL-5 and IL-13, leading to eosinophilia through a mechanism that does not require IL-4 [138] . Further examination is needed to determine the role of the G protein in inflammatory disease and Th2-responses. Collectively, the antagonistic RSV proteins give RSV the capacity to directly or indirectly impair immune cell activation and skew Th1/Th2 profiles [139] .",

In particular, a potent proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), is produced by macrophages upon NF-\u03baB activation in RV16-infected macrophages derived from either THP-1 or primary monocytes [141] . NF-\u03baB activation has been correlated with another respiratory virus, Sendai parainfluenza virus 1, which was used to model virus-induced asthma exacerbations in brown Norway rats [142] . Infection with Sendai virus substantially increased expression of the p50 subunit of NF-\u03baB and this implies functional activation of NF-\u03baB [143] . Upon virus infection, respiratory epithelial cells show increased expression of several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors, TLR3 [144] and TLR4 [145] , in response to HRV and RSV, respectively. RSV-mediated TLR4 overexpression was associated with sensitization of epithelial cells, resulting in enhanced IL-6 and IL-8 production after stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide [146] . Lastly, both HRV and RSV utilize ICAM-1 as a receptor for viral attachment and upregulation of ICAM-1 could enhance viral infection. HRV has been observed to selectively enhance membrane-bound ICAM-1 while suppressing expression of secreted ICAM-1 [62] . In recognition of this binding requirement for effective viral infection by either HRV or RSV, therapeutic applications have attempted to target ICAM-1 with blocking monoclonal antibodies [147] . Application of the ICAM-1 blocking antibody CFY196 showed promise in HRV infections and reduced RV infection symptoms and length of disease in human subjects [148] [149] [150] . Similarly, blockage of ICAM-1 through a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 attenuated RSV infection of epithelial cells in vitro [60] .",

Relatively weak Th1-like responses were also attributed to more severe respiratory disease and longer viral shedding. In human trials, asthmatic individuals did not have increased risk of HRV infection. Instead, the symptoms of clinical illness extended for longer times and were reported as more severe than in healthy, nonasthmatic cohabiting partners who had acquired HRV infections [6] . While healthy controls usually had mild upper respiratory illness for three days, asthma patients developed both upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms for up to five days. A distortion of Th1/Th2 responses is expected to predispose subjects to more severe allergic reactions [93, 139, 151] . HRV infections in vitro stimulate IL-4 upregulation in the PBMCs of atopic asthmatics [152] , which contrasts with the usually observed decrease in IL-4 in PBMCs of healthy controls. Likewise, after RSV infection, ovalbumin-allergic mice have airway hyperresponsiveness and enhanced Th2-responses, accompanied by an upregulation of IL-4 and increased eosinophilia in the lungs, upon inhalation of ovalbumin [153] .",

While the mechanism may be different, RV14 infection in A549 decreased the nuclear translocation of IRF3 as compared to cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which is known to induce IFN-\u03b2 responses. Moreover, immunoblots displayed a loss in the homodimer form of IRF3 in RV14-infected cells compared to VSVinfected cells at both four hours and seven hours post-infection. Interestingly, the expression of PRR-like melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) or mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein were unchanged in lysates after infection with RV14 at four or seven hours post-infection. Together, this evidence suggests that RV14 disrupts nuclear translocation of IRF3 and suppresses IFN-\u03b2 production after infection without disrupting either MDA5 or MAVS. Figure 1 illustrates the mechanisms by which RSV and HRV infections may skew the Th1/Th2 profiles and enhance Th2 responses in allergic or asthmatic individuals.",

(Table 4 ) HRV capsid surface proteins are highly variable among the 100+ serotypes, and passive immunization will likely provide marginal, if any, protection. Since the majority of HRV-induced illnesses in healthy individuals do not lead to hospitalizations, with cold-like symptoms peaking within 2-3 days and usually subsiding within a week, therapeutic benefits of any HRV intervention would need to significantly outweigh the risks associated from delivering treatment or immunizing with a vaccine. As with the failed clinical trials of FI-RSV, the associated dangers from vaccine delivery are unpredictable and could result in symptoms that are more serious. Conversely, if respiratory viral agents contribute to the development of asthma, prophylactic use of antivirals has potential to prevent ARI as well as the chronic illness. Current antiviral drugs target the steps involved in viral propagation to suppress the spread of infection [64, 155] , including attachment, replication, protein synthesis, and release of viral progeny, as illustrated in Figure 2 . Alternatively, supplementation with interferons promotes antiviral and immunological effects, thereby decreasing cell susceptibility; intranasal interferon has demonstrated effective prophylactic potential in enterovirus and HRV studies [155] . In an RSV-infected murine model, intranasal administration of the plasmid encoding IFN-\u03b3 decreased the neutrophilia and pulmonary inflammation that is associated with RSV-induced disease [156] .",

As complementary pharmacological agents or alternatives to passive immunization, small molecule inhibitors and viral protein antagonists are showing promise in tissue-culture and animal models [75, [163] [164] [165] . A few of these alternative, experimental studies are proceeding to clinical application and may be successful. DeVincenzo et al., in 2010, were the first group to demonstrate a proof-ofconcept application of RNAi (RNA interference) for protection against RSV by delivering siRNA to the respiratory tract in human subjects given experimental RSV infection [107] . RNAi-based therapies have shown promise in vitro and in animal models for various human diseases, predominantly cancer. In rodent models, intranasal delivery of siRNA against the nucleocapsid (N) protein (ALN-RSV01) before or 1-2 days after RSV inoculation reduced lung viral titer loads by at least two logs [166] . Gene silencing of the well-conserved RSV N protein disrupts viral replication through impairment of the RSV RNA polymerase. ALN-RSV01 is the first siRNA delivered to humans via the intranasal route for specifically combating a microbial pathogen [166] . In a randomized, phase II study conducted by DeVincenzo et al., ALN-RSV01 decreased RSV infection in experimentally RSV-inoculated subjects by 38% compared to placebo-treated controls, as diagnosed by two culture-based assays [107] . From days 4 to 7, post-infection, the mean viral load in PFU/mL decreased approximately 1 log as detected by qRT-PCR. The antiviral effect of ALN-RSV01 was found to be independent of preexisting RSV-neutralizing antibodies or cytokine concentrations. Thus, ALN-RSV01 exhibits potential for therapeutic use in healthy adults. However, low statistical power and insufficient sample numbers hinder the study's reliability in evaluating the antiviral dose-responsiveness of ALN-RSV01 with respect to viral load and disease symptoms over the entire term of the study. ALN-RSV01 remains an attractive antiviral candidate since few adverse affects were observed in normal adult humans. Further investigations are needed to test the efficacy of RNAi against natural infections and its applicability to infants and RSV-risk groups.",

To cope with virus-induced bronchiolitis, a variety of antiinflammatory pharmacological agents, such as bronchodilators and steroids, are recommended for susceptible individuals to reduce airway inflammation. National health organization guidelines often recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the primary treatment for recurrent asthma, followed by short-or long-acting \u03b22-agonists (SABA and LABA) and cysteinyl-leukotriene (Cys-LT) receptor agonists (LTRA) [167, 168] . ICS act to reduce asthma symptoms and help improve forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) [169] . Although ICS demonstrate potency against other inflammatory diseases and continue to be the preferred drug for managing asthma symptoms, evidence is lacking to support ICS in preventing virus-induced wheezing in corticosteroid-unresponsive subpopulations [169, 170] . In a clinical study of UK children aged between 10-30 months hospitalized for wheezy ARI, oral corticosteroid prednisolone administration over five consecutive days failed to reduce disease severity or hospitalization length significantly [170] . According to a retrospective U.S. study, steroid-insensitivity was frequent in adolescent populations (~14 years of age); up to 24% of patients with severe asthma failed to respond to glucocorticosteroid therapy [171] . Inconsistent responsiveness to ICS likely results from genetic variability, atopic family history, and airway fibrosis that accumulates after severe epithelial damage [172] . Currently there is insufficient information to assess the effects of ICS on virus-induced illnesses.",

Two clinical trials of the Cys-LT known as montelukast demonstrated efficacy against RSVinduced asthma exacerbations, as compared to placebo. Bisgaard et al. monitored children from 3 to 36 months old for 28 days to compare the effect of chewable tablets of montelukast on RSV-induced bronchiolitis, compared to placebo [173] . In the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, subjects receiving monteukast reported fewer symptoms and disease severity was significantly less than in the placebo-receiving control population. Post-hoc analysis of a similar, but more extensive study by Bisgaard et al. revealed a comparable therapeutic effect of montelukast on RSV-bronchiolitis [174] . Furthermore, Kim et al. specifically investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of montelukast in infants for a 12-month period by analyzing eosinophil degranulation, as measured by the secretion of an eosinophil biomarker, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) [175] . EDN is more stable than other eosinophil biomarkers and is therefore a better representation of eosinophil inflammatory activity than eosinophil counts alone. For that reason, the group used EDN levels for estimating disease severity and recurrent wheeze. Kim et al. observed significantly higher levels of EDN in RSV-infected populations than in uninfected controls; furthermore, patients receiving a 3-month's course of montelukast had significantly lower levels of EDN than the placebo-treated group. Based on this evidence, montelukast could be used to treat RSV bronchiolitis; however, further investigation is needed to understand the antiviral mechanism and how different subpopulations respond to the drug.",

In 2006, 197 children hospitalized for asthma exacerbations and wheezing episodes were examined in a year-long prospective, cross-sectional study in Buenos Aires [24] . The ages ranged from 3 months to 16 years and PCR was utilized for detecting virus and bacteria in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. In agreement with others, Maffey et al. found virus or bacteria in 78% of the cases (40% RSV, 4.5% HRV, 4.5% M. pneumoniae and 2% C. pneumoniae). With increased sensitivity, PCR has enabled detection of pathogens that would otherwise be nondetectable by culture methods. In addition, the methods for recruiting, diagnosing, and examining ARI subjects are becoming standardized for better comparisons to other studies. However, several factors continue to cause variability in community-based studies. Environmental, economic, and social variables will continue to challenge how diagnosticians and healthcare workers collect data. In some studies, obtaining controls is difficult due to semi-invasive procedures, and comparisons must often be made with asymptomatic individuals [26] . Furthermore, the statistical power of these studies is reduced by the relatively small number of eligible and cooperative participants. While most cohort investigations study infants and older children hospitalized for severe ARI symptoms, additional studies on less severe cases should be done to determine how mild RSV infections are associated with wheeze.",

While there is a growing body of evidence supporting a causal relationship for HRV, a similar relationship for RSV is difficult to prove since virtually all children have been infected with RSV by the age of two [66, 79] ; therefore, the development of asthma likely depends on genetic and/or atopic factors [176] . Sim\u00f5es et al. recently reported new evidence that associates RSV infection with the development of recurrent wheeze in nonatopic infants, in a worldwide, multicenter, 24-month investigation [177] . Prophylactic delivery of palivizumab decreased the relative risk of recurrent wheezing in nonatopic infants by 80%. Surprisingly, palivizumab failed to improve wheezing outcomes in infants from families with atopic genetic backgrounds. As one of the first investigations to evaluate the protective effects of palivizumab against recurrent wheeze, the evidence from Sim\u00f5es et al. suggest that early-life RSV infection significantly predisposes nonatopic populations to recurrent wheeze. Additional investigations that utilize prophylaxis, including passive immunization through neutralizing antibodies and other antiviral candidates, are needed to better understand the contribution of viral infections to the development of asthma. Smallinterfering RNA, neutralizing antibodies, and RSV fusion inhibitors show promise in vitro and in murine models, but the feasibility of broad-use application remains to be tested [64] . As the asthma epidemic persists and wheezing conditions continue to increase the costs of healthcare, the world awaits the application of more effective prophylactics to prevent microbe-associated respiratory illnesses.
