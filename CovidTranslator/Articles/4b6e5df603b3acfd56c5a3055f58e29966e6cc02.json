Nine patients were identified prospectively and were followed during their hospitalization course to identify the epidemiology, clinical profiles and outcomes. These patients had one or more cultures positive for a CRE isolate, contributing to a total of eleven positive cultures from various sites without including duplicates of isolates obtained from the same site. Isolates from these patients included five Klebseilla pneumoniae, three Escherichia coli, and one Enterobacter aerogenes. Five isolates were grown from blood cultures, three from wound cultures, one from urine cultures, one from respiratory cultures and one from an abscess collection. Five survived the hospital course. The other five patients died due to severe sepsis, septic shock or multi-organ failure. Of the nine isolates of CRE identified for which molecular analysis were available, four K. pneumonia were confirmed as blaNDM and one as OXA-48. For the purpose of controlling the spread of CRE in our institution, we recommend considering active surveillance cultures and screening patients transferred from other hospitals or coming from highly endemic settings at admission for these organisms.",

            "text": "Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) including the non-fermenters, has caused a major public health concern all over the world [1, 2] . International travel, migration, and contaminated food products have been responsible for the spread of these microorganisms to several countries beyond their origin [3, 4] . The extensive use of carbapenems in hospital settings, particularly when the infection control practices are inadequate, has contributed to an increased prevalence of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) [5] . Spread of infection is mediated by the potential of these organisms for widespread transmission via mobile genetic elements [5, 6] . Spread of Escherichia coli acquiring the plasmid-borne carbapenemase has been reported [7] . Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negatives can cause serious nosocomial infections particularly in critically ill patients, and are associated with increased mortality rate (ranged from 44% to 70%, for bacteremia was 50%) and sometimes outbreaks [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In addition, spread of CRE into the community is a major concern. They usually demonstrate resistant to other commonly used antibiotics such as quinolones and aminoglycosides [13] [14] [15] . Recently, pan-resistance to all antimicrobial agents including colistin and tigecycline has also been reported [16] . The limited therapeutic options available to treat patients infected with CRE have made these organisms of epidemiologic and diagnostic importance. Until date, no clear data on effective therapy of infections caused by CRE are available. Combination treatment of two or more antibiotics was shown to be more effective than monotherapy for infections caused by CRE [17, 18] . Active surveillance to detect colonized patients, implementation of strict infection control measures and contact precautions, are important ways of preventing the introduction and transmission of these bacteria in healthcare settings. Increasing prevalence of CRE isolates including CRE outbreaks in some hospitals is a growing problem in Saudi Arabia [19, 20, 21, 22] . The main purpose of this case series is to evaluate and describe the important clinical and epidemiological features of CRE infections in our institution.",

Nonduplicate carbapenem-nonsusceptible isolates, and resistant to all thirdgeneration cephalosporins were selected for the investigation. The modified Hodge test (MHT) and the MBL E-test were performed as confirmatory test for some selected isolates.

Except for one isolate which was colistin resistant (8 g/ml), the CRE isolates identified in these nine patients were susceptible to colistin but showed variable susceptibilities to aminoglycosides (MIC range, 0.5 to >256 g/ml) and fluoroquinolones (MIC range, 0.25 to >32 g/ml). All the carbapenemase producers were highly resistant to the third and fourth generation cephalosporin, including piperacillin-tazobactam (MIC range, 8 to >256 g/ml). Tigecycline was the only antimicrobial agent active against all isolates (MICs, 0.12-2 g/ml). Prior treatment with carbapenems were documented in three patients. Four patients were given aminoglycosides, three were given colistin, and none were given fluoroquinolones. Six patients received combination treatment including carbapenem. Only two patients received tigecycline, one for septicemia and ventilator associated pneumonia caused by K. pneumonia (died) and the other for psoas abscess caused by E. coli (discharged). Interestingly, one patient had a history of surgery for hip fracture in India 3 months prior to his presentation and another patient was transferred from Egypt. Carbapenemase genes were detected in 4 of the 9 clinical isolates.",

She had diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease on dialysis, and rheumatic heart disease with severe mitral and aortic stenosis. The patient presented two months ago to a private hospital with shortness of breath, repeated cardiac arrest, intubated and stayed in the ICU for two months. She developed bedsores in her back with large abscess requiring incision and drainage. During hospitalization, she had ventilator-associated pneumonia due to Stenotrophomonas multophilia and blood stream infection with a multidrug resis-tant Acinetobacter spp. for which she received multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, linezolid, imepenem, tigecycline and ceftazidime. On referral to our hospital for further ICU care, the patient was sedated, hemodynamically unstable with low level of consciousness (10/15), and signs of septic shock (hypotension (123/69 mm HG), hypothermia (36 \u2022 C) bradycardia (52 beats/min). The patient was intubated (oxygen requirement of 35% pressure support) and on low dose vasopressors dose, dopamine, noradrenaline, hydrocortisone and insulin infusion. She has central venous catheter, nasogastric tube, and folly's catheter. Both pupil were dilated (5 mm) with sluggish reaction to light. Examination of the back showed a big (7 \u00d7 8 cm) infrascapular abscess. Chest examination revealed bilateral basal crepitation. Lab investigation showed hemoglobin of 9.4, WBCs 6.9 cells/mm 3 , platelets 33, Na 133, K 308, INR 21, urea 31, creatinine 167, and albumin 27. She was started empirically on colistin (3IU IV Q12hr), meropenem (Igm IV Q12Hr), vancomycin (500 mg IV OD) and amikacin (500 mg IVOD). Two days after admission, caspofungin (50 mg OD) was given and Trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was done to exclude infective endocarditis, which was ruled out as no vegetation was seen. Over the next few days, she was stable and vancomycin was suspended. Two weeks after admission, septic work up from two consecutive blood cultures (from central line and dialysis line) showed blood stream infection with K. pneumoniae resistant to all antibiotic including carbapenem except colistin. The same isolate was grown from the tracheal aspirate. The isolate was shown to be a New-Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase producer (NDM). Accordingly, she was started on colistin, tigecycline and the central line was changed. Repeated blood cultures were negative. On the next two days, the patient showed mild improvement in her clinical condition. After two weeks while on treatment, she developed a breakthrough fever and septic workup was done. Candida glabrata and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeroginosa were isolated from the blood. Tigecycline was discontinued and all the lines were changed. A repeated echocardiogram and ultrasound of abdomen were done. Ophthalmology team was consulted for suspected disseminated candidemia. The patient clinically improved and became afebrile. During her hospitalization stay, she developed persistent watery diarrhea for which colonoscopy and Clostridium difficile toxin antigen detection test were negative. Repeated blood culture grew carpapenem resistant K. pneumonia (CRE) resistant to all antimicrobial agents including colistin. The patient developed hyperkalemia (6.1), severe metabolic acidosis and deteriorated renal function, acute adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and her blood pressure dropped to 80/40 mm HG. She had multiorgan failure due to refractory septic shock and was arrested and died after 2 month of hospitalization. Laboratory testing revealed, meropenem and imipenem MICs (>32 g/ml) as determined by Etest. The isolate was confirmed as a carbapenemase producer by the modified Hodge test of the CLSI. PCR and sequencing confirmed the presence of blaNDM-1, and plasmid analysis revealed this was carried on a 98 kb. Gene-expert analysis using XbaI was carried out on the two K. pneumonia isolates from the patient (the carbapenemresistant K. pneumoniae from the blood and tracheal aspirate)",

Unfortunately, Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has been reported in many countries [5] [6] [7] 13] . Carbapenemases and porin loss combined with AmpC enzyme hyperproduction are the main two mechanisms of resistance [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Carbapenem resistance can be mediated through the production of acquired metallo-\u2424-lactamases (MBLs) such as VIM and IMP, or non-metallo-carbapenemases of the IMI/NMC, SME, OXA or KPC families. [26] [27] [28] . Alterations or losses of porins in members of the Enterobacteriaceae have also been reported [26, 30, 32] . Results from large hospital-based surveillance studies in China of the genotypic characterization of 49 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems has shown that, moderate-to high-level carbapenem resistance was mainly due to loss or decreased expression of both major porins combined with production of AmpC or ESBL enzymes, while other carbapenemase (KPC-2, IMP-4, and IMP-8) was associated with a low to moderate level of carbapenem resistance. [24] . On the other hand, a review of 171 clinical Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. isolates from UK reference laboratory found that very few had true carbapenemases production combined with impermeability [25] .",

In hospitalized patients, it is important to identify CRE infections before these organisms are transmitted in the same hospital or to other health care facilities. Effective infection control policy including implementation of a notification system and infection-prevention measures when CRE are identified in the laboratory is highly recommended. Identified CRE infected or colonized patients should be placed on contact precautions [34] . Surveillance cultures from patients with epidemiologic links to CRE casepatients should be considered to identify additional unrecognized CRE colonized patients. Early detection of colonized cases allows appropriate implementation of contact precautions and prevents transmission to other patients and staff [35] . Active surveillance cultures have been used as part of an effective policy to interrupt transmission of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in several investigations [36] [37] [38] [39] . Only few remaining antibiotics are currently in use to treat CRE infections including, polymyxins, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, fosfomycin, and temocillin. Combination therapy with 2 or more drugs is superior to monotherapy and associated with better survival rate [40] [41] [42] . In this series four patients died due to septic shock refractory to treatment. The combination Ceftazidime-avibactam have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating complicated urinary tract and complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by CRE isolates that produce KPC and AmpC and partial activity against OXA enzymes; however, this drug is not active against metallo-\u2424-lactamases such as NDM, VIM, or IMP [43] . Although, all those patients had severe underlying diseases, the lack of or delay in initiating appropriate treatment might contributed to the poor outcome.",

Identification of CRKP in the urine is not always associated with urinary tract infection. Case 1 in this series, had carbapenem-resistant K. pneumonia bacteriuria (CRKP) bacteriuria during his elective admission for endoscopy, which most probably represents colonization rather than real infection. Qureshi ZA, et al. has found that, the majority of patients (80%) with CRKP identified from urine, are having asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than UTI [44] . Molecular diagnosis was not performed and actual resistance mechanisms were not identified in all isolates. In conclusion, CRE infections is a growing problem in our hospital and are expected to increase in prevalence and involve other hospitals. We believe that, antibiotic stewardship and strict infection control measures are essential for preventing further spread of CRE. For the purpose of controlling the spread of CRE in our institu-tion, we recommend considering active surveillance cultures and screening patients transferred from other hospitals or coming from highly endemic settings at admission for these organisms. Finally, more research is needed from our institution from all over the world to identify the epidemiology and molecular profile of the involved CRE associated infections.",
