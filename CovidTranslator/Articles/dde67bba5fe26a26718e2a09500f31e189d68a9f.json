Gastrointestinal disease outcomes are also more severe, due to under-nutrition and lack of intervention strategies in these regions. Poor water quality, sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide (3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all DALY's), mainly through infectious diarrhoea. Nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries. Major enteric pathogens in these children include: rotavirus, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp. and Vibrio cholerae O1, and possibly enteropathogenic E. coli, Aeromonas spp. V. cholerae O139, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile and Cryptosporidium parvum. All except the latter are easily control by chlorination of water, but recontamination of treated water is a huge problem. Emerging environmental pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori and Burkholderia pseudomallei, may well be of significance in some regions. In adults, much less is understood of various sequellae such as myocarditis, diabetes, reactive arthritis and cancers some months-years after initial infections. So in addition to the traditional pathogens (helminths, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia hepatitis A and E) various enteroviruses, C. jejuni and H. pylori are emerging issues in adults.",

Furthermore, the efficacy of drinking water treatment (traditionally by filtration and chlorination) to remove the bacterial pathogens responsible for cholera (Vibrio cholerae) and typhoid fevers (Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi), is well indexed by the common faecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is excreted in the faeces of all warm-blooded animals and some reptiles (Edberg et al., 2000; Enriquez et al., 2001) . There are however, many enteric pathogens that behave differently to E. coli, particularly with respect to disinfection resistance and environmental persistence (Ashbolt et al., 2001) . Of particular concern are the chlorine-resistant parasitic protozoa, such as the environmentally shed oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum and various enteric viruses (Hambidge, 2001; Li et al., 2002) . It is therefore important to match the appropriate indicator for the group of pathogen(s) of interest, noting that there is no universal indicator, as often assumed with thermo-tolerant (faecal) coliforms or E. coli.",

Yet the drinking water associated outbreak of cholera in Germany during 1892 was the foundation point of our modern understanding of waterborne pathogens. It was shown that residents of Hamburg suffered a very high mortality due to cholera, whilst people in neighbouring Altona served by the same-source water as in Hamburg, but a treatment by slow-sand filtration, helped them to escape the worst ravages of the outbreak. The German microbiologist, Robert Koch first isolated and described the causative agent, which he named Vibrio comma (later renamed to V. cholerae). This lead to sand filtration and taking John Snow's demonstration (1845) of the efficacy of chlorine disinfection, both became the norm from 1897 for the treatment of piped water in the then developing regions of Europe, United Kingdom and North America. These late nineteenth century innovations resulted in the largest reduction in global disease burden of any intervention since. Similar improvements have been sought in various developing regions of the world, many of which have been reported by Saunders and Warford (1976) and subsequent World Bank funded developments.",

Nonetheless, there are specific insights. In a random sample of 2355 Filipino infants over the first year of life, it has been suggested that improving drinking water quality would have no effect in the neighbourhoods with very poor environmental sanitation; yet in areas with better community sanitation, reducing the concentration of thermo-tolerant (faecal) coliforms by two orders of magnitude would lead to a 40% reduction in diarrhoea (Vanderslice and Briscoe, 1995) .

Further behind in importance were typhoid and paratyphoid fevers (caused by Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi, respectively), resulting in an annual incidence of about 17 million cases world-wide (Kindhauser, 2003) . Both typhoid pathogens are passed in the faeces and urine and people become infected after eating food or drinking beverages that have been handled by a person who is infected or by drinking water that has been contaminated by sewage containing the bacteria. Once the bacteria enter the person's body they multiply and spread from the intestines, into the bloodstream.

In warm regions of the world, the serogroups that cause epidemic cholera (Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139) are endemic in freshwater zooplankton (Colwell et al., 2003) and outbreaks occur in a regular seasonal pattern in developing regions in association with poverty and poor sanitation. The disease is characterised by devastating watery diarrhoea which leads to rapid dehydration and death occurs in 50-70% of untreated patients (Faruque et al., 1998) . Cholera toxin (CT), which is responsible for the profuse diarrhoea, is encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage designated CTX Phi, which probably results in a continual emergence of new epidemic clones. Hence, the ecosystem comprising V. cholerae, CTX Phi in the aquatic environment and the mammalian host offers a complex relationship between pathogenesis and the natural selection of a pathogen (Faruque et al., 1998) , wherever there continues to be a lack of adequate water filtration and/or disinfection (Table 3) .",

In the case of HEV, although the mortality rate is usually low (0.07-0.6%), the illness may be particularly severe among pregnant women, with mortality rates reaching as high as 25% (Aggarwal and Krawczynski, 2000) , as seen in large outbreaks in China and sporadic outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent, southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa and Mexico (Naik et al., 1992) . Recent isolation of a swine virus resembling human HEV has also opened the possibility of zoonotic HEV infection (Halbur et al., 2001) . A study in India on hepatitis E infections indicated that 70% of the cases were due to contaminated water and 20% due to food (Gerba and Rose, 2003) .",

Hence, along with Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia these protozoa seem to be endemic to developing regions. Studies in a peri-urban shanty town in Lima, Peru, suggest that Giardia lamblia is hyperendemic in children (<10 years old) and despite treatment, 98% of the children became re-infected with Giardia lamblia within 6 months (and excreted for a mean of 3.2 months). Hence, treatment of all symptomless Giardia lamblia infections in a developing country hyperendemic for the disease is of questionable value because of rapid re-infection (Gilman et al., 1988) .",

While a major cause of morbidity and mortality (up to 10% of the population of the developing world is infected with intestinal wormsa large percentage of which is caused by Ascaris; and world-wide severe Ascaris infections cause approximately 60 000 deaths per year, mainly in children [Kindhauser, 2003] ) it is largely a disease of people exposed to untreated wastewater or food grown on it. The 85 000 hectares in the Mezquital Valley of central Mexico is a classic example where raw sewage is used to irrigated food crops and causes significant diarrhoea and Ascariasis (Cifuentes et al., 1993) . WHO have long recognised the importance of wastewater associated Ascariasis and set a guideline of <1 ova per litre (in 1989), which is likely to remain in future guidelines (Blumenthal and Peasey, 2002) .",

There are, however, several emerging waterborne issues. Foremost is the rapid urbanisation of humans in developing regions and the further stress that places on inadequate water supply and sanitation. Associated with increased human activity is the eutrophication of waterways and the resultant increases in diseases. For example, cholera outbreaks are well known to be associated with phytoplankton blooms in nutrient-rich coastal waters. Climate change too is now seen as a reality, with not only a change in the distribution of rainfall, but one also of greater extremes in global weather patterns. Major waterborne outbreaks typi-cally follow large storm events in developing regions. Yet perhaps the greatest threat of all lies with the nature of microbial evolution, significantly increases with high density living and close association with animals. SARS has been a recent messenger to remind us of the significance small genetic changes can have in what was regarded as a relatively benign Coronavirus (Kuiken et al., 2003) . Not only do we have to contend with continual evolution of new pathogens, but decline of the ozone layer also has microbial health implications. For example, various diseases have been shown to increase due to UV light suppression of human defence systems (Norval, 2003) . In conclusion, despite our efforts, pathogens will always be a major issue for human health, and particularly so in developing regions.",
