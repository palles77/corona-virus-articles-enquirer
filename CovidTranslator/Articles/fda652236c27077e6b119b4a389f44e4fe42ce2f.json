Normal provision of healthcare to patients and adequate protection of healthcare Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was a novel contagious infectious disease that first emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong province, China. It spread rapidly, infecting thousands of people in 30 countries across five continents, and resulted in hundreds of fatalities. The high infectivity, morbidity and mortality created panic around the world. The evidence suggests that SARS-CoV was transmitted primarily by droplets and by direct contact. 1e3 Working at the frontline in the battle against a previously unknown lethal pathogen, healthcare workers (HCWs) were victims of the SARS catastrophe from nosocomial infection. 4e8 The procedure of emergency resuscitation, such as endotracheal intubation or airway management, can stimulate coughing and often necessitates open suctioning of respiratory secretions. These close-contact procedures put resuscitators at high risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV. Frontline HCWs who directly participated in endotracheal intubation had an increased risk of subsequently developing SARS. 9 For the purposes of providing adequate infection control procedures to protect staff, several infection control measures (ICMs) were implemented in our hospital.",

After the first SARS case was admitted to this hospital, strict ICMs were implemented and enforced. However, the implementation of ICMs was a great challenge, especially in emergency resuscitation. HCWs had to spend extra time preparing for resuscitation procedures and, even with prior training, the additional protective measures made it harder to perform emergency resuscitation. Several ICMs limited the capacity of HCWs to provide emergency care. Furthermore, the increasing number of cumulative probable cases of SARS reported in the news media and in government announcements was a cause of great stress among HCWs during emergency resuscitation.",

Immediately following confirmation of the first SARS case in our hospital (period 2), strict ICMs were implemented and the personal protection equipment (PPE) during emergency resuscitation was upgraded to an N95 respirator and/or surgical mask, gloves, gown and goggles as well as rapid sequence intubation if indicated. ICMs before and during resuscitation of suspected SARS patients included the standard operating procedures of wearing gloves and gown, in addition to use of airway and breathing equipment, intubation and ventilator. Other strict hospital ICMs in period 2 included the following: (i) all new admissions were required to be examined by our emergency department's SARS screening team; (ii) all febrile patients were required to be admitted to the fever screening ward regardless of their diagnoses; (iii) unnecessary contact between HCWs was restricted and regular meetings and conferences were cancelled; (iv) each step of the standard operating procedure was strictly audited during resuscitation.",

This may have been because many patients were likely to have delayed visiting a hospital out of fear of catching SARS, especially in areas where hospital-associated transmission of SARS had occurred. 10 Strict implementation of ICMs, such as a fever screening station, a fever triage ward, and restricted admission of fever patients, prolonged the processes in the ED and decreased the accessibility of healthcare. These measures may have resulted in an increased number of complicated cases and a higher demand for emergency resuscitation. Changes in habits of hospital healthcare after infectious control precautions were announced may also have affected emergency care. One such change was shortened patientephysician contact, which resulted in less communication between patients and physicians as well as reduced frequency of meetings and chart rounds. There were also more emergency resuscitations performed without intubation and a higher number of 'do not resuscitate' orders signed during resuscitation in the period of strict implementation of ICMs. These changes resulted in an abnormal situation in which the hospital's facilities were adversely affected and the ability of the hospital to provide patients with medical care during the SARS outbreak was reduced.",

Each step requires additional time when combined with other ICMs and this prolongs the duration of resuscitation. Furthermore, if physicians have insufficient experience with the techniques, the ICMs may be less effective. 12, 13 The incidence of emergency resuscitation occurred most frequently in ordinary wards, but the proportion was significantly increased in the ED in the period of strict implementation of ICMs. Ho et al. reported that when there was a high index of suspicion for SARS during the SARS period, hospitals were recommended to avoid admitting patients with undiagnosed SARS to general wards, where protection was likely to be inadequate and infection control awareness low. 4 This policy may lessen the likelihood of outbreaks in other parts of the hospital but it could increase the length of stay at the ED. During the SARS outbreak, ICMs were more strictly applied in the ED because most of the ED visits had ill-defined symptoms or signs and the contact or travel history was often unknown in patients requiring emergency resuscitation. Patients were typically required to undergo some ICMs, such as examination by the ED's SARS screening team, before admission during period 2.",

The response time of resuscitation was unchanged during period 2 despite the fact that physicians and nurses spent more time performing emergency resuscitation during this period. This may have been due to the resuscitators putting more effort into saving the patients' lives, or there may have been an association with patients' underlying disease or other conditions. The implementation of additional control measures, such as preintubation ICMs before resuscitation and standard operative procedures during resuscitation, may also have extended the duration of resuscitation. Ho et al. recommended routine use of several protective devices and training of staff in infection control in order to expedite isolation of all patients with clinically confirmed or suspected SARS. Prolonged preparation of PPE and ICMs could influence the outcome of resuscitation.",

Our data found, however, that the factor 'fever or pneumonia' did not significantly affect the results of resuscitation. This may have been due to the requirement that all of the ICMs had to be implemented for all patients who required resuscitation, without exception. Therefore, the implementation of strict ICMs, rather than specifically affecting fever or pneumonia, had a general effect on all patients.",

It is well known that delays in supplementation of oxygenation, ventilation or tissue perfusion can affect the results of resuscitation. Obviously, these changes will decrease HCWs' risk of exposure to contagious disease, but it is important to note the serious ethical implications involved.",

Although it is unclear from our findings whether or not strict ICMs affected the outcome of resuscitation, it was our experience that the implementation of strict ICMs caused major changes in the ED which had an obvious potential to influence the outcomes of regular medical care, such as emergency resuscitation. Infection control experts, hospital administrators and health policymakers must develop clear guidelines so that HCWs can adequately protect themselves from infection while meeting their ethical obligation to save the life of a patient during emergency resuscitation. This dilemma will certainly be an important problem in the next outbreak of a highly contagious disease.",
