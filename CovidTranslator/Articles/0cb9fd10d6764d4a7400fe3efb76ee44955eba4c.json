Throat swabs were obtained from contacts on days 7 and 14 postexposure, and serum samples were drawn on days 7 and 21 postexposure (online Technical Appendix, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/21/8/ DISPATCHES 15-0560-Techapp1.pdf). Throat swab samples from 1 relative contact were unavailable; a second serum sample was missing from 7 relatives, 3 aircraft contacts, and 1 travel contact (a woman who had had no contact with animals, had not visited a hospital, and had no concurrent conditions). Eight contacts who reported symptoms (7 unprotected and 1 protected) were sampled immediately after onset of symptoms. MERS-CoV reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on paired throat swabs from 106 (81%) and serologic analysis on paired serum samples from 99 (76%) of the 131 contacts (Table 1) . PCR did not detect MERS-CoV RNA from any throat swab or serum samples, and MERS-CoV-specific IgG responses were absent in serum samples tested (8) ( Table 1 ).

To evaluate the effect of monitoring, we used the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), a validated questionnaire designed to assess current subjective distress for a specific traumatic life event (9) . The IES-R contains 22 items divided into 3 subscales: avoidance (e.g., avoidance of feelings), intrusion (e.g., nightmares) and hyperarousal (e.g., anger). The mean score on 3 subscale domains indicates the level of distress experienced (9) . Mean scores of unprotected contacts were compared with those of protected contacts by a Wilcoxon rank-sum test or t-test. Significance was determined at the 5% level (p value <0.05). A total subjective stress IES-R score with a maximum score of 88 (Likert scale of 0-4 [0, never; 1, seldom; 2, sometimes; 3, often; 4, very often]) can be calculated. We considered a score >20 to be an indicator of posttraumatic stress disorder to enable comparison with previous studies (10, 11) .",

As with other emerging infections, such as Marburg hemorrhagic fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome, quarantine or monitoring of contacts leads to psychological distress, measured by high IES-R scores (10, 11, 14) . When stratifying by type of contact, the total mean IES-R score and the subscale scores were highest for unprotected contacts-those with the highest risk for exposure. We found increased symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in a considerable number of contacts, similar to findings by Hawryluck et al. (11) and Reynolds et al. (10) . The survey response rate of 55% limits interpretation of results; motives for noncompliance remain unknown. Also, recall bias might influence recollection of experiences. Besides exposure, monitoring has contributed to the psychological effect. Whether the number of questions induced stress is not known, but participants did not mention this as a concern.",

Identification of close contacts of those who are infected should be carefully considered, and decisions about monitoring and testing of contacts should be made primarily on the basis of clinical and epidemiologic risk factors.",
