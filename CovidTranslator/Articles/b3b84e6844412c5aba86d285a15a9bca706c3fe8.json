In addition, in the type I interferon gene 26 family, the MHC class I genes and natural killer cell receptor family have been reported to be 27 highly expanded in the bat genomes 10 . These studies provided evidence to support the hypothesis 28 that bats have evolved a highly specific genetic configuration, especially in the innate immunity 29 pathways. A major caveat is the lack of systematic examination of the functions of these genes 30 due to shortage of functional genomic tools. 31 CRISPR and RNAi technologies have enabled genome-wide screening of gene functions for a 1 variety of cell types, yielding an unprecedented wealth of information revealing the complexity of 2 biological processes 11, 12 . This is especially true in the field of virus-host interactions, where a 3 plethora of host factors have been identified for a variety of viruses [13] [14] [15] . Both technologies have 4 advantages and disadvantages and provide complementary approaches to achieve comprehensive 5 genetic perturbations [16] [17] [18] . CRISPR permits complete knockout of a gene, thus affords generation 6 of truly null genotype. A caveat is that the lethality associated with knockout of essential genes 7 prevents functional parsing of these genes in different biological processes. In addition, CRISPR 8 screening is usually used a pool-based format that requires the generation of stable cell lines 9 through long term culturing. Therefore, CRISPR is suited for studying phenotypes that require a 10 longer time to manifest. Based on previous studies, CRISPR screens demonstrated excellent 11 specificity but limited sensitivity 17 . In contrast, siRNA screening relies on temporary knockdown 12 of genes in an individual well format, a methodology suited for examining short-term phenotypic 13 changes. Due to the transient nature of the assay, siRNA screening can tolerate growth defects due 14 to gene knockdown and can elucidate hypomorphic phenotypes induced by siRNAs with varying 15 degrees of knockdown. In general, RNAi screens allow comprehensive identification of genes in 16 a biological process at the cost of more false positives due to pervasive off-target effects 17 . To fully 17 realize the power of CRISPR and RNAi screening as complementary strategies to interrogate gene 18 function in bats, here we developed a pool-based CRISPR library and a plate-based siRNA library 19",

Further virus 14 titration assay demonstrated that MTHFD1 knockdown significantly inhibits viral replication for 15 mumps virus in PaKi cells ( Fig. 2d and 2e) . The effect is similar to the knockdown of SEC61B, a 16 well-studied host protein required for viral replication and a top hit in our RNAi screen ( Fig. 2d  17 and 2e) 23 . We additionally tested Melaka virus (PRV3M), a pteropine orthoreovirus that causes 18 acute respiratory disease when transmitted by bats to humans 28 . PRV3M titer was also significantly 19 reduced by MTHFD1 knockdown ( Fig. 2e and 2f) . Infection of Zika virus, a member of the 20 flavivirus family, was also inhibited by MTHFD1 knockdown using siRNA (Fig. 2g) . Alternative 21 knockdown with stable expression of two shRNAs validated the requirement of MTHFD1 for the 22 replication of mumps virus and Zika virus (Fig. 2h, 2i and 2j) .

MTHFD1 is a key enzyme 21 in the C1 metabolism responsible for production of purine, dTMP and methyl group, the first two 22 of which are building blocks for DNA and RNA synthesis. Interestingly, all previous RNAi and 23 CRISPR screens using human cells have not identified MTHFD1 as a host factor. Moreover, we 24 found bats cells and tissues have lower MTHFD1 expression levels than their human counterparts 25 (Supplementary Fig. 5a, 5b and 5c ).

This is analogous to cancer cell's addiction to non-2 oncogenic gene functions such as many metabolic enzymes 35 . Similar to the therapeutic targeting 3 of these non-oncogenic addictions for developing cancer drugs, these viral addictions to metabolic 4 enzymes such as MTHFD1 could open doors to many new opportunities for developing broad-5 spectrum antiviral drugs 36 . These drugs could be readily applied in emerging epidemics, as 6 demonstrated by our evidence here that MTHFD1 inhibitor carolacton can suppress the infection 7 of SARS-CoV-2.
