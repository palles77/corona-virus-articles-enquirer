A 2007 study by Kano et al 15 examined the preparedness of 83 schools in Los Angeles County and found that although most of the school representatives reported believing that their school was prepared for a disaster, many deficiencies in emergency planning existed. Identified deficiencies in school disaster planning included insufficient written disaster plans, staff training in disaster preparedness, and prearrangements to obtain supplies during an event. 15 That study did not ask evaluate the schools' pandemic and biological disaster preparedness, however. The other school study that aimed to measure school disaster preparedness only examined issues surrounding school closure during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 16 Many other aspects of school preparedness for biological disasters, such as a written plan to address biological events, school nurse/worker access to personal protective equipment, and participation in community syndromic surveillance programs, need to be assessed.",

An overall school preparedness score was calculated by assigning 1 point for each component that nurses reported in their school disaster plans. Thirteen of the 17 school preparedness indicators were scored only as 1 or 0. Examples include having a written plan (plan, 1; no plan, 0), having a stockpile of or access to PPE (yes, 1; no, 0), and frequency of disaster drills/exercises (at least once a year, 1; less than once a year, 0). Indicators that could be partially met were assigned 1, 0.5, or 0 points. These indicators included disaster plan and respiratory hygiene training for staff (all staff trained, 1; some staff trained, 0.5; no staff trained, 0), school nurse mandatory influenza vaccination policy (immunization mandated, 1; encouraged, but not mandated, 0.5; neither mandated nor encouraged, 0), and continuity of operations plan (distance-based program in place, 1; working on plan, 0.5; no plan for distance education, 0). The highest possible score for school disaster was 17, and that for pandemic preparedness was 11 (ie, 1 point for each of the 17 or 11 components). Descriptive statistics were computed for each question and used to describe the components of the school's disaster and pandemic preparedness and the plan to function as a POD in a future disaster. Fisher's exact test was used to compare rates of mandating vaccine across the types of school employees (eg, nurses, teachers, counselors). The c 2 test was used to identify any differences between public versus private schools when comparing the stockpiling of infection prevention supplies. Linear regression was used to describe factors associated with higher school and pandemic preparedness scores. Nonsignificant variables were not included in the final models; only final models are reported.",

There remains room for improvement, however, given that a fair percentage of participating schools reported not having a written disaster plan despite the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that all schools have a disaster preparedness plan in place. 14 Even more alarming, almost half of all school plans were not coordinated with local and regional response agencies, and many schools did not train staff in the disaster plan. The previous study reported similar findings regarding the need to improve schools' written plans and increase staff disaster plan training. 15 These are areas of school preparedness that do not appear to be improving much, despite the increased number of disasters over the past few years, including the H1N1 pandemic. It is vital that schools become more actively involved in disaster preparedness and coordinate these efforts with regional response agencies, to increase their ability to respond effectively to a future event.",

Findings from this study suggest that most schools are even less prepared for an infectious disease disaster, such as a pandemic, compared with a natural disaster or other type of event. Despite the recent H1N1 pandemic, which disproportionately affected schoolaged children, many schools do not have an adequate plan in place for a future biological event. Less than half of the participating schools reported having a plan to address biological events or updating their existing plan in response to the H1N1 pandemic, and almost no schools reported using an infectious disease scenario in a school disaster exercise to test their plan. These actions are basic tenets of disaster and pandemic preparedness, 22, 25 and schools need to be encouraged to examine these more complex issues involved in disaster preparedness.",

This would also strengthen the school's coordination with regional disaster planning agencies, such as the public health department. Lack of coordination between school and community disaster plans has been identified as a gap in disaster planning. 15 Schools should partner with local public health agencies in sharing absenteeism information and/or other syndromic surveillance indicators when feasible.",

            "text": "Most of the schools in this study reported lacking access to supplies needed to respond to a biological event, including medications and PPE, a finding that was also reported by Kano et al, 15 indicating that schools need to make prearrangements to ensure access to supplies during a disaster. Although the majority of schools reported training all staff on respiratory hygiene practices, many do not provide annual student training on basic infection prevention practices. Infection prevention training and access to PPE are important not only for disaster preparedness, but also for everyday minimization of infection transmission in schools. In 2002, Robinson 28 asserted that it is the role of school nurses to develop and implement infection prevention policies and programs to decrease disease transmission in schools, including educational programs such as respiratory hygiene. Schools need to partner with local planning agencies to ensure that they will have access to supplies during a disaster, including being designated as a priority group for receiving pandemic-related vaccines or medication and PPE. In this study, schools that reported being better prepared for a future disaster or pandemic were more likely to be designated as a POD and to have experienced increased student or employee morbidity or mortality related to H1N1 during the pandemic. The POD designation may be a significant factor in readying schools for disasters or pandemics, because it requires that the school be actively engaged in local or regional disaster planning efforts. This involvement likely influences the school in preparing for future disasters and may provide additional guidance to the school on disaster planning efforts, such as plan development and testing, through interaction with regional emergency managers/experts. Schools with better disaster and pandemic preparedness scores were also more likely to have had a lead nurse or a school nurse involved in the school disaster planning committee complete the survey compared with schools that had a non-lead nurse or a nurse not on the disaster planning committee participate in the study. This finding has critical implications for schools wishing to improve their disaster and pandemic planning efforts. One simple strategy for increasing school disaster preparedness appears to be involving school nurses in planning efforts. School nurses are the health professionals responsible for implementing policies and programs to prevent infection transmission in schools, 28 and thus are those best able to inform school disaster planning committees on aspects of plan development that will affect infection transmission. In addition, the National Association of School Nurses recommends that school nurses be involved in school disaster preparedness activities. 29 School nurses may require additional training in pandemic planning to feel comfortable in this role. Future research should evaluate competencies for school nurses related to pandemic planning and assess school nurses' current comfort and ability related to performing in this crucial role.",

Although three-quarters of the school nurses in this study reported receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine during the 2010-11 season, the uptake rate remains well below the target of 90% compliance outlined in Healthy People 2020. 31 It is essential that school districts work to increase influenza vaccine uptake among school nurses, because this will likely result in decreased influenzarelated morbidity and mortality. One factor that may be influencing school nurse influenza vaccine uptake is the low prevalence of mandatory vaccine policies reported by the school nurses in this study. Previous research indicates that approximately 12% of nonhospital agencies have a mandatory vaccination policy, 30, 32, 33 yet only approximately 2% of the school nurses in this study reported having such a policy. Mandatory vaccination policies have been found to be very strong predictors of vaccine uptake, 30 and multiple organizations, including the CDC 34 and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, 35 recommend that all health care workers be vaccinated against influenza every year. School administrators should consider implementing a seasonal influenza vaccination policy for nurses that is a condition of employment. 35 School districts also should create a system to track nurses' seasonal influenza vaccine compliance, a recommendation made by the CDC for US health care agencies. 36, 37 This will facilitate vaccine compliance during a disaster or pandemic, which should decrease event-related morbidity and mortality. It also may be prudent for schools to mandate seasonal influenza vaccination for teachers and other staff who have close contact with students. Influenza can readily spread within schools when staff and students are in close proximity to each other; vaccination of key staff would decrease infection transmission.",

Previous research has focused primarily on schools' ability to respond to a single-child medical emergency rather than a school-wide disaster response. None of the limited studies available on school-wide disaster response examined pandemic planning. This is the first study to examine school pandemic preparedness. The use of a national sample increases the generalizability of our findings. Several limitations of this study must be noted. One limitation is the potential issue of nonresponder bias. We could not directly assess individual characteristics of the nonresponders, a common issue in survey research. Very few nurses who work with college or university students participated in this study; thus, the findings may not be generalizable to institutions of higher learning. There was a low response rate in some states, namely those states that posted a link about the study rather than sending an e-mail recruitment letter to their members. This low response rate may reflect school nurses' unawareness of the study, a selection bias, or some other bias. This could potentially limit the generalizability of our findings. In addition, because only US school nurses were invited to participate in this study, the findings might not be generalizable to school preparedness in other countries. Despite these limitations, this study provides a foundation for future work examining school pandemic preparedness.",
