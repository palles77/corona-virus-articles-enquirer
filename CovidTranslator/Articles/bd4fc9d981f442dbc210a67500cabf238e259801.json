            "text": "How to effectively prevent the diffusion of infectious disease has become an intriguing topic in the field of public hygienics. To be noted that, for the non-periodic infectious diseases, many people hope to obtain the vaccine of epidemics in time to be inoculated, rather than at the end of the epidemic. However, the vaccine may fail as a result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then vaccinated individuals may become re-susceptible and be infected again during the outbreak. To this end, we build a new framework that considers the imperfect vaccination during the one cycle of infectious disease within the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. Meanwhile, we propose a new vaccination update rule: myopic update rule, which is only based on one focal player's own perception regarding the disease outbreak, and one susceptible individual makes a decision to adopt the vaccine just by comparing the perceived payoffs vaccination with the perceived ones of being infected. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the imperfect vaccination behavior under the myopic update rule in the spatially structured and heterogeneous population. The results indicate that healthy individuals are often willing to inoculate the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can stop the infectious disease from being spread, in particular, it is found that the vaccine efficacy influences the fraction of vaccinated individuals much more than the relative cost of vaccination on the regular lattice, Meanwhile, vaccine efficacy is more sensitive on the heterogeneous scale-free network. Current results are helpful to further analyze and model the choice of vaccination strategy during the disease outbreaks.",

One of the most striking cases regarding the outbreaks was H1N1 pandemic in 2009 [12] , which induced around 15 , 0 0 0 deaths. During the outbreaks of H1N1, the suppression of epidemic processes can not only be attributed to the public measures, but also through personal and uncoordinated responses, that is, the human behavior has noticeably interfered with the epidemic spreading. In the long run, human behavior has been intricately correlated with the contagion of infectious diseases. In medieval ages, the deadly bubonic plague rendered many people to avoid and flee away from the sick and their close contacts so that their own immunity can be secured [13] . Similarly, the villagers of Yorkshire in Eyam tried to voluntarily quarantine themselves to stop the spread of the plague from that village [14] . In 2003, during the outbreak of SARS, many citizens spontaneously wear the face masks, some schools are temporarily closed and the students are imperatively required to stay at home so as to avoid the further epidemic infection as much as possible [15] . In addition, protective behavior when confronting the epidemics has also been observed in many other contexts, such as Measles-Mumps-Rubella(MMR) [16] , tuberculosis(TB) [17] and HIV [18] etc.",

At present, mathematical models have been put forward to study the role of human behavior in the context of social population, such as escape panic [19] , pedestrian trails [20] , but effort s to quantitatively explore the role of human behavior in the large-scale epidemics generally focus on assessing the effectiveness of various public health measures including the social distancing, school closure etc. In the recent years, there are many fields and methods to help us to study infectious disease [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , however, there is an increasing attention about the effect of spontaneous individual action or response strategy on the progression of an infectious disease, in which this kind of spontaneous actions may highly restrain from the further diffusion of epidemics and even change the fate of outbreaks. Thus, it is of great significance to fully understand the interacting mechanisms between the human behavior and disease dynamics within the specified population. It is worth mentioning that Funk et al. [33] systematically summarized the related works and provided a taxonomy framework of behavior-disease models. On the one hand, they classify these models according to source and type of information that individuals base their neighbors on, in which source of information may be local or global and the type of information that individuals change their behaviors are prevalence-based or belief-based; On the other hand, they classify the previous works based on the impact of individual behavior changes on the disease dynamics, which include the following three aspects: (i) the disease state; (ii) model parameters (infection or recovering rate); and (iii) the network contact structure relevant for the spread of epidemics.",

Henceforth, the vaccination behavior may dominate the evolutionary process of vaccine preventable diseases. Among them, Bauch and Earn [34] seminally utilized the game theory to model the dilemmatic situation for an individual facing with the epidemics, and they proposed a class of vaccination game to denote the individual decision making and found that, for the well-mixed population, the Nash equilibrium is never to vaccinate if the vaccination cost is higher than that of being infected; but there exists a Nash equilibrium yielding a suboptimal vaccinated fraction if the vaccine cost is lower than that of being infected.",

            "text": "As a further step, complex networks, beyond the well-mixed topology, provide a unified platform to characterize the topology of real-world populations, where the nodes represent individuals and links mimic the contacts among them [35] . Thus, under framework of game theory, many works are devoted to exploring the interplay between contact patterns, behavioral responses and disease dynamics. As an example, Fu et al. [36] found that heterogeneous networks, such as scale-free ones, can induce a broad range of vaccinating actions of many individuals since highdegree hubs with many neighbors become voluntary vaccinators more probably in order to reduce the risk of being infected. After that, Zhang et al. [37] demonstrated that the hubs may largely inhibit the outbreaks of infectious diseases under the voluntary vaccination policy. In the meantime, various subsidy policies on controlling the epidemic spreading have been determined from the socioeconomic perspectives within the well-mixed and networked population [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . Furthermore, most previous works [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] often assume that the vaccine has a perfect efficacy, which will endow the complete immunity for the inoculated individuals, but an interesting topic is on how the epidemic spreads when the vaccine is not fully effective for the disease (i.e., 100% efficacy)? Besides, in the vaccination game, whether an individual decides to vaccinate the vaccine or not will be often determined by the estimated payoff, and the vaccinating decision may be transferred from one player to another one inside the population according to a specific role model during the outbreaks. Nevertheless, under some real-world scenarios, some individuals are not willing to imitate the behaviors of others as a result of special belief, religion, opinion and even awareness of a disease.",

Generally, inoculating the vaccine is considered as an effective measure, but the vaccine may fail as result of invalid storage, transportation and usage, and then rendered that the vaccinated individuals may confront the risk of being infected. Henceforth, some individuals make a decision to vaccinate just judge by themselves and don't consider their neighbors. Thus, in order to deeply analyze the role of vaccine efficacy and spontaneous individual decision mechanism in the outbreak of vaccine preventable diseases, we propose a vaccination game model to explore the impact of imperfect vaccine efficacy and myopic update rule in the spatially structure and heterogeneous populations. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Firstly, we depict the new vaccination game model in Section 2 in detail. Then, Section 3 provides extensive numerical simulation results, which are obtained in the regular lattice and heterogeneous scalefree networks, respectively. Lastly, in Section 4 , we end this paper with some conclusions and point out the potential works in the future.",

Among them, for the epidemic sub-steps including t = 0 , we leverage the frequently used susceptible-infective-recovery (SIR) compartment model to characterize the evolution of epidemics, where each individual may lie in the susceptible (S), infective (I) or recovery (R) state. During the vaccination decision sub-steps, each susceptible individual needs to assess the risk of being infected, and then make the decision whether he will vaccinate or not.",

As an example, when c \u2264 0.5, \u03c1 V and \u03c1 R can almost keep the similar vaccination level as c increases; However, c > 0.5 leads to the substantial reduction of \u03c1 V and the continuous rising of \u03c1 R since the vaccination cost is comparable to the infection cost; In particular, \u03c1 V will be dramatically reduced when c is up to 0.95, even tends to zero as the vaccination cost is too high, especially for c = 0 . 95 . On the other hand, under the same vaccination cost c, \u03c1 V decreases as the vaccine failure rate becomes higher, for instance, the fraction of adopting the vaccination strategy under c = 0 . 06 is much less than that with c = 0 . 05 , which implies that the vaccinated fraction within the whole population will be a little more sensitive to the vaccine failure rate.",

Afterwards, when the relative cost of vaccination c is more than 0.5, the greater the noise selection strength, the more rapidly the varying trend of \u03c1 V and \u03c1 R . In fact, as the strength of selection increases, individuals become much more rational and will not tend to take the vaccination strategy since they will take their own economic cost and the related interests, say, free-riding behavior, into account. In particular, the relative cost c is beyond 0.5, or the vaccine loss rate is higher (i.e., \u03b8 = 0 . 06 ), the un-vaccination behavior of rational individuals become much more prominent, and thus it is unable to prevent the outbreaks of epidemics, which can be observed from the larger \u03c1 R as c > 0.5 or \u03b8 = 0 . 06 .",

It is clearly indicated that at the lower vaccine failure rates (say, \u03b8 < 0.04), the fraction of vaccinated individuals is often more than half of the total population, even if relative cost of vaccination c is large (e.g., 0.9); Meanwhile, a plethora of vacci- Thus, creating the high quality vaccine is significant, which greatly determines the individual vaccination inclination. Furthermore, to deeply understand individual state change in the lattice as SIRV model evolves, we record the evolutionary snapshots of individual states at various time steps for \u03b8 = 0 . 03 , c = 0 . 3 and \u03b8 = 0 . 08 , c = 0 . 8 in Fig. 5 . Among them, the upper eight panels denote the snapshots under \u03b8 = 0 . 03 and c = 0 . 3 , while the lower eight panels represent the ones for \u03b8 = 0 . 08 and c = 0 . 8 . At time step t = 0 , there are no vaccinated individuals on the lattice and only I 0 = 10 randomly infected seeds, and then the epidemic starts to propagate at this time. After that ( t \u2265 1), the susceptible individuals have the opportunity to determine whether they will inoculate the vaccine or not. It is clearly observed that most individuals choose to vaccinate under these two cases when epidemic begins to spread. However, when \u03b8 = 0 . 03 is lower, there is fewer vaccinated individuals to become susceptible, and then most of vaccinated individuals are immunized, in which the epidemic is hard to spread and finally tends to be extinct. Reversely, for the higher vaccine failure rate (i.e., \u03b8 = 0 . 08 ), the vaccine is easy to be invalid, many vaccinated individuals become susceptible due to the loss of vaccine efficacy. Therefore, the epidemic can be pandemic and then most of individuals enter the recovered state in the end. All these results again demonstrate that the vaccine efficacy plays the significant role in the evolution of vaccination behavior of epidemic outbreaks within the structured population.",

In all panels, the red, blue and yellow lines denote the evolution of susceptible, recovered and vaccinated individuals, respectively. It can be found that the vaccinated individuals increase rapidly in a very short time, and then reach a peak. Vaccinated individuals are rarely become susceptible because of the vaccine failure \u03b8 is lower (as shown in Fig. 6 a,c) so that the number of recovered ones increases a little and arrives at the equilibrium quickly, which states clearly that the epidemic is eliminated and has not become pandemic. Due to the vaccine failure rate, the fraction of vaccinated individuals goes down and then tends to be zero after reaching the peak. However, when the value of vaccine failure rate \u03b8 is raised (as shown in Fig. 6 b,d) , even though the vaccinated individuals increase rapidly, they become susceptible quickly due to the high vaccine failure rate \u03b8 , it can't prevent the epidemic spread so that the number of recovered individuals increases. Additionally, we found that for the value of vaccine failure rate \u03b8 = 0 . 03 , whatever the values of relative cost of vaccination c , the number of recovered agents is the same as that at the equilibrium. Generally, when the epidemic starts to spread, many susceptibles take the vaccine in the population at a short due to the perception of infection risk. Also, this vaccination behavior is almost widespread regardless of the values of relative cost of vaccination c and vaccine failure rate \u03b8 . At the lower vaccine failure rate, vaccinated individuals are hard to become susceptible, which leads to the disease propagates difficultly and be eliminated as soon as possible. These results are also consistent with the work of Zhang et al. [37] , since the hub nodes are often vaccinated immediately after the disease starts to spread. But for the higher vaccine failure rate, the vaccinated individuals become susceptible quickly, the disease can outbreak.",

After the epidemic starts to propagate, and most of individuals change their strategies to adopt the vaccine in a short time since the individual can estimate the infection risk at the early stage, which leads the epidemics to be hard to spread within the population.

For example, the value of vaccine failure rate \u03b8 is usually assumed to be no more than 10%, or else most vaccinated individuals become re-susceptible again. At a fixed \u03b8 , the fraction of vaccinated individuals almost keep unchanged when the relative vaccine cost is not beyond c = 0 . 5 , but this value will become lower and lower after c is more than 0.5, which is basically consistent with the reality of vaccine usage. On the contrary, on the scale-free networks, the number of vaccinated individuals is more sensitive to the effect on vaccine failure rate \u03b8 . Hub nodes have a stronger inclination to adopt the vaccine under the myopic update rule, which can effectively prevent the diffusion of epidemics. Hence, the disease will be eliminated quickly in heterogeneous topology. However, when the values of vaccine failure rate increase a little bit, hub nodes become susceptible and cannot prevent the epidemic spread, which leads to the epidemic outbreak. Meanwhile, when the relative cost of vaccination c increases, unvaccinated susceptible individuals are not willing to choose the vaccination strategy, which can not stop the outbreak of infectious diseases. When the vaccine failure rate further increases, such as 0.03, the number of vaccinated individuals decays to zero before the epidemic is eliminated, which is almost equivalent with the classic SIR model. Anyway, current results are conducive to better understanding the individual vaccination behaviors when confronting the real epidemics.",

On the contrary, at the high vaccine failure rates ( \u03b8 > 0.06), \u03c1 V is very slow and it indicates that there are few healthy individuals to choose the vaccination strategy after performing the infection risk assessment, which further leads to the potential outbreak of epidemics. In particular, when the vaccine failure rate is beyond 0.09 (i.e., \u03b8 \u2265 0.09), the whole population is almost recovered regardless of the value of c , which means the real outbreak of epidemics. The current results strongly demonstrate that the vaccine failure \u03b8 dramatically affect the evolution of vaccination behavior in our model, the equilibrium fraction vaccinated and recovered individuals is almost dominated by the vaccine failure rate, while the impact of the vaccine cost c can play an important role just under the intermediate value of vaccine failure rate (say, \u03b8 = 0 . 04 \u2212 0 . 06 ).",

As the vaccinated proportion enhances, \u03c1 V increases while \u03c1 R declines whatever the way of vaccination is. It is natural that when the vaccinated proportion grows, there are more unvaccinated susceptible individuals, who can choose to vaccinate and obtain the immunity so that the epidemic can not spread.

As the value of vaccine failure is raised, the vaccinated individuals become susceptible more easily and the epidemic can outbreak, the risk of infection of unvaccinated susceptible ones also grows, which renders that the payoffs of being infected i NV are increased. Thus, even the value of relative cost of vaccination c rises, unvaccinated susceptible individuals are more likely to choose the vaccination strategy, which is different from results on regular lattices. When the value of relative cost of vaccination c > 0.6, due to the higher cost, unvaccinated susceptible individuals are unwilling to choose the vaccination, and then the number of vaccinated individuals declines. The \u03c1 R under the RAND is enhanced with the increase of the relative vaccination cost c , but is different from those under the HUB, which is related to the variation of \u03c1 V . As the relative cost of vaccination c and vaccine failure rates \u03b8 increases, the \u03c1 V declines rapidly under the RAND at each propagating time step.
