A genuinely sustainable society is one that initiates developments in sustainable ways. The development of a genuinely sustainable society is supported by its citizens who think and act according to a recognized code of conduct -the sustainable culture. Similar to other forms of culture, sustainable culture of a society is not static, but changes over time. The changes found in a sustainable culture are reflections of the status of sustainability in a society and these changes should be measured from time to time. The resulting measurement gives very important information for decision-makers, in the government and in the private sector, to examine the magnitude of changes that have taken place in a given period of time. The results will also enable them to review and adjust policies in order to better accommodate changes according to the trends of society.",

In 2000 the gross value of construction work undertaken in Hong Kong was over HK$120 billion (US$15 billion)'', the construction industry is therefore a major contributor to the Hong Kong economy. The number of persons employed in the construction industry accounted for 7.4% of the total work force in Hong Kong (C&SD, 2008) . However, the construction industry also generates a large amount of waste that pollutes the environment. According to a report by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD, 2007) , construction waste amounted to 29,884 tonnes per day in 2006, 27% (4,125 tonnes per day) of the total construction waste were disposed of at landfill sites in Hong Kong.

The answers to these questions are directly related to the developments in sustainable culture among stakeholders via implementation of these rules and regulations.

In this paper, a method, the T-model, is explicitly designed to capture such changes. An illustration of the T-model is elucidated in Section 4.2.

Appropriate scores were assigned to each question (a sample questionnaire with score allocation is attached in Appendix 1 for reference). Data collected from the questionnaire surveys were input in the T-model to work out the movement of cultural components. To capture the movement of the cultural component ''awareness'' within the government group, the scores obtained from questionnaire surveys related to the awareness of the government group are sorted out according to the marking scheme setup in the questionnaire. The sorted scores of awareness are then multiplied by the influential factor (a i ) of the government group, the product is the cultural value of awareness of the government group. This cultural value of awareness of the government group can be added up with the cultural value of awareness of other groups being worked in the same way to form the total score of awareness of construction participants. Similar approaches are applied to other cultural components to obtain the total concern, total motivation and total implementation of construction participants.

All stakeholder groups indicated certain shifts in sustainable culture within the study period. Positive shifts were found in most of the stakeholders groups, these shifts are evidences of improvements in sustainable culture among stakeholders. The presence of a few negative shifts that included the developer group in implementation, the consultant group in concern, and the NPP group in awareness and concern. These negative shifts represent deteriorations within these groups, proper corrective actions that may transform attitudes and behaviours of the respective stakeholder groups could yield significant and persistent improvements to sustainability in the construction industry. The cultural values of the government group and the contractor group positively increased in all the cultural components, the former is the policy making party which promotes sustainability and the latter is the execution party which is obliged to perform according to statutory requirements and regulations.

The summary of test results shown in Table 9 reveals that the shift of cultural components in all stakeholder groups is evident in the research period between years 2000 and 2006. There are a few occasions in the analysis that had exceeded the 5% significance level and therefore the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Among all stakeholder groups, the developer group was the least aggressive stakeholder in cultural change. Insignificant shift was found in ''awareness '', ''motivation'' and ''implementation'' between year points of 2000, 2002 and 2004 . Similar results are obtained from the Government group in ''concern'' and ''implementation'' between years 2000 and 2002, reflecting the fact that the Government and the Developer groups in Hong Kong were not aggressive in the early years of the promotion of sustainable development in construction. In contrast, the Consultant, the Contractor and the NPP groups exhibited significant cultural shift throughout the research period. These three groups are the executors of project design and construction, their non-performance in sustainability are governed by rules and regulations with penalty system. Their readiness to comply with the sustainable requirements and adopting changes in practicing sustainable construction is understandable. As a result, these three groups pioneered cultural shift towards sustainability in practice.",

One of the most important issues was the implementation of landfill charges of construction and demolition (C&D) waste disposed in the landfill sites (Cap. 354, 2005) . Stakeholders of the construction industry in Hong Kong tried strenuously to reduce construction waste generated from construction activities. The landfill charge policy affected all construction practitioners because it applied not only to construction operations but also influenced substantially on contractual arrangements and commercial benefits. Stakeholders tried to reduce contractual liability in the generation of C&D wastes starting from design activities to construction operations. Such an attempt has resulted in changing their habitual practices in their daily performance and has subconsciously induced changes in sustainable culture among stakeholders.",

It is interesting to find the growth of sustainable culture was sluggish from years 2000 to 2002. In this period, economic growth in Hong Kong was retarded and high unemployment rate was recorded due to an economic recession. Although there was no improvement in economic conditions, the change became significant between the years 2002 and 2004. It is believed that the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which claimed 299 lives in Hong Kong in 2003 raised the awareness on hygienic conditions coupled by a demand for improvement on the living environment. The spread of this fatal epidemic and the attempt to subdue and prevent have resulted in a remarkable change in the recognition of sustainability among Hong Kong citizens. After the drastic growth between the years 2002 and 2004, the positive cultural shift steadily increased between the years 2004 and 2006.",

Fig. 2 synthesized all the cultural components in years 2002 and 2004 with respect to the base year 2000. Furthermore, the scores of cultural components of the 2006 survey are handled in the same way as shown in Table 8. The scores of each cultural component were placed in space diagram Fig. 3 showing the shift between the years 2004 and 2006. The areas of the quadrangles developed in Figs. 2 and 3 are displayed in the space diagrams with areas formed by the four cultural components the corresponding years. To derive the cultural shift of the studies, square root the area of each quadrangle will provide a linear representation of the research results.

Combining of the results of the surveys of 2004 and 2006 The results shown in Figs. 4 and 5 represented the outcome of two different surveys in different time frames with different random sample respondents. It is important to note that the studies generated two sets of results for year 2004. The result of cultural shift value derived from the year 2004 survey is 22.92, while the result of cultural shift value of the year 2006 survey is 22.51. The differences are sufficiently close to each other with variance less than 1.8%. It would be safe to judge that the study outcomes obtained from both survey activities are reliable. According to the research methodology, the former 2004 cultural shift value was the actual surveyed result of the 2004 survey, while the latter 2004 cultural shift value was the calculated result of the 2006 survey. The actual surveyed result of year 2004 is considered more appropriate to reflect the research finding. Therefore the integrated cultural shift value of 22.92 is adopted to combine the outcomes of both surveys in year 2004 and 2006. The cultural shift curve shown in Fig. 6 is a combination of the curves of Figs. 4 and 5 with the connection point at 22.92. The curve shown in Fig. 6 represents the trend of cultural shift of the construction industry of Hong Kong between the years 2000 and 2006 under the influence of sustainable development as introduced by Government.",
