Gyeonggi-do province is located in the North-West of South Korea, surrounds the capital city Seoul, and borders North Korea ( Figure 1 ). Considering the geographical coverage, GAFINet Initiative involves ten hospitals, consisted of four university-affiliated hospitals and six provincial medical centers in Gyeonggi-do province. These hospitals participated in this network voluntarily, and most staffs including five infectious diseases specialists had direct or indirect experiences in dealing with MERS-CoV patients.",

AFI was defined as 1) fever: body temperature \u226538 \u00b0C at admission, or 2) chief complaint of febrile or chilling sensation. Demography of patients and chief complaints were investigated in this first step (CRF #1). Cases were classified into six categories based on their clinical diagnoses: 1) respiratory AFI [AFRI] , 2) gastroenteric AFI [AFGI] , 3) exanthematic AFI [AFEI], 4) other infectious AFI, 5) non-infectious AFI, and 6) unclassified AFI. Participating infectious diseases specialists regularly reviewed and reformed this classification. Because the aim of GAFINet is primarily monitoring communityor aboard-acquired infection, nosocomial AFI cases or the patients transferred from another hospital were excluded. When a patient had a history of international travel or he/she were undiagnosed in three days after ED admission, more comprehensive information (CRF#2 & #3) including history and final diagnosis were obtained. For a baseline data, age-and sex-stratified ED visits were also gathered weekly. The proportion of AFI cases per 1000 visits was determined for one week period and analyzed by febrile diseases categories with age-stratification. Characteristics of cases with international travel histories or undiagnosed cases were also described separately.",
