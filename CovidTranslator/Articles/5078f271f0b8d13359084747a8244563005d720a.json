In this study, we generated a recombinant rmNA-VP3, expressing GPV VP3 using a modified goose-origin NDV NA-1 by changing the multi-basic cleavage site motif RRQKR\u2193F of the F protein to the dibasic motif GRQGR\u2193L as that of the avirulent strain LaSota as a vaccine vector. Expression of the VP3 protein in rmNA-VP3 infected cells was detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot assay. The genetic stability was examined by serially passaging 10 times in 10-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs. Goslings were inoculated with rmNA-VP3 showed no apparent signs of disease and developed a strong GPV and NDV neutralizing antibodies response. This is the first study demonstrating that recombinant NDV has the potential to serve as bivalent live vaccine against Goose parvovirus and Newcastle disease virus infection in birds.",

This is a gastrointestinal disease characterized mainly by diarrhea and fibrous hemorrhagic necrotic enteritis. With high mortality and morbidity, GPV has caused substantial economic losses to goose farming countries of Europe and Asia (Jansson et al., 2007; Takehara et al., 1995) . To control the disease caused by GPV, live attenuated vaccines are widely used in breeder geese or goslings in addition to flock management (Gough and Spackman, 1982; Kisary, 1977) . Usually, the attenuated viruses for vaccines were obtained by serial passages in cultured goose-embryo fibroblasts (GEF) or embryonated goose eggs to reduce the pathogenicity . However, the potential risk of reversion to virulence of attenuated live vaccines is always a concern. Additionally, the current available vaccines are prepared with chorioallantoic fluid collected from infected embryos, which is costly and inefficient due to the limited availability of SPF (specific pathogen free) goose and duck embryos (Ju et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2010) . Therefore, the development of alternative strategies for producing safe and effective vaccines may be of great significance.",

The molecular basis for the pathogenicity of NDV is mainly determined by the amino acid sequence of the protease cleavage site located in F protein. Mesogenic and velogenic viruses have a polybasic amino acid motif of 112 R/KR-Q-K/R-R-F 117 , while viruses of low virulence have a monobasic amino acid sequence of 112 G/E-K/R-Q-G/E-R-L 117 at the cleavage site (Choi et al., 2010; Panda et al., 2004; Peeters et al., 1999) . Lentogenic and, in some cases, mesogenic strains of NDV are widely used as live attenuated vaccines in poultry. In recent years, they also have been developed as a vector to express foreign protective antigens based on reverse genetic techniques. The use of such live vector vaccines for immunization not only protect birds against NDV and another poultry pathogens, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) (Ge et al., 2007) and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) (Huang et al., 2004b) , but also has the potential to serve as effective vaccines for human use against SARS-CoV or other emerging viruses (DiNapoli et al., 2007a (DiNapoli et al., ,b, 2010 .",

Two types of immunization strategies were adopted in field: vaccination of breeder geese before laying, by which the offspring was protected depending on maternally derived antibodies in the egg yolks, and vaccination of susceptible goslings, where the virulence of the vaccine strains needs to be much lower than that of strains used to immunize parent flocks. Preparation of vaccines with varying levels of virulence makes the production very costly and labor-effective. Therefore, the development of a safe, effective and low-cost vaccine is necessary.

Firstly, NDV grows to very high titers in many cell lines and embryonated eggs, which allows cost-effective and easy manufacture of the vaccine. Secondly, NDV has a simple genome encoding only a few proteins than other viruses such as fowl pox virus and adenovirus. Thirdly, the live NDV vaccines can induce not only humoral immunity and cellular immunity simultaneously, but also a strong mucosal immunity, which makes this expression vector more attractive (Huang et al., 2003) . NDV lentogenic vaccine strains such as LaSota can be developed in vectors directly; while mesogenic strains should be modified by changing the multi-basic cleavage site sequence of the F protein to the dibasic sequence of avirulent strains because these strains might cause disease in poultry and most strains are classified as Select Agents (Kim et al., 2014) . Recently, it has been demonstrated that the virulent isolates also can be attenuated by modification in the same way to serve as a live-attenuated vaccine candidate (Hu et al., 2009 (Hu et al., , 2011 Xiao et al., 2012) .",

Epidemiological studies revealed that genotype VII NDV strains were circulating predominantly worldwide after the fourth panzootic (Huang et al., 2004a; Miller et al., 2009 Miller et al., , 2010 and found to be responsible for the ND outbreaks in Asia, Africa, Middle East, and South America (Munir et al., 2012; Perozo et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2006) . These strains also caused many outbreaks of ND in domestic geese with high mortality and morbidity in Southern and Eastern China since the late 1990s, which was referred as goose paramyxovirus (GPMV) in earlier reports (Cai et al., 2011; Jinding et al., 2005) . However, the genotype II vaccine strains such as LaSota or Hitcher B1 remain in current and widespread use, and the differences in their antigenicity and genotypes between the presently circulating strains and commercial vaccine strains are considered the main reasons for the ND outbreaks in vaccinated poultry flocks (Liu et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2007) . Recent work has demonstrated that genotype-matched vaccine strains provide better protection than conventional vaccines in terms of reducing virus shedding and transmission following challenge with NDV virulent virus (Hu et al., 2009 (Hu et al., , 2011 Xiao et al., 2012) . In 1999, a highly virulent genotype VII NDV strain NA-1 was isolated from outbreaks in goose flocks in our lab (Xu et al., 2008) . To evaluate whether this genotype VII isolate could be used as a vaccine vector for geese we generated a recombinant virus rmNA-VP3 expressing VP3 protein of GPV after modifying the polybasic F cleavage site of NA-1 to the dibasic motif of LaSota. It is interesting that the modified NA-1 which has exactly the same F protein cleavage site as avirulent LaSota did not form syncytium in virus-infected cells as LaSota did. Even in the presence of exogenous protease no syncytium was observed (Fig. 1C) . These results are repeatedly confirmed and consistent with previous research on the mutation of a highly virulent Indonesian strain (Xiao et al., 2012) . It is demonstrated that the syncytium formation is not determined by the motif of the F protein cleavage site alone; some other factors may also be involved. Anyway, the inability to induce the formation of syncytia, may be indicative of a highly attenuated of the modified viruses comparing with LaSota.",

To evaluate its heredity stability, the recombinant virus rmNA-1 and rmNA-VP3 were passaged continuously in chicken embryos and the sequence of F protein cleavage site was determined every generation. The results demonstrated that the mutated F protein cleavage site always remained stable after 10 passages in chicken embryos. The safety issue of the recombinant viruses should be further evaluated through its serial passage in geese prior to its use in field.",

A detectable immune response against GPV was evidenced after the first immunization dose, and after the second immunization administered 3 weeks later, significant booster responses to VNA of GPV were induced. Moreover, the antibody level did not drop markedly during at least the first 12 weeks. Meanwhile, the neutralizing antibodies against NDV vaccine vector were also detected. The mean titer induced by rmNA-VP3 was comparable to that induced by rmNA-1, indicating that this recombinant virus holds its characteristic in stimulating effective immune response against NDV infection.",

Firstly, the recombinant rmNA-VP3 will be highly economical for the poultry industry, because rmNA-VP3 can be cultured in many cell lines and embryonated eggs. Secondly, the recombinant virus can potentially overcome maternal antibody interference. Therefore, it can be used for vaccination with or without maternal antibody. Even in the presence of the maternal antibody, it can be used to enhance protection in the early danger period of gosling life. Finally, this recombinant virus would be developed an in-ovo vaccine against GPV after further modified as describe in in-ovo vaccination against IBDV and NDV elsewhere (Ge et al., 2014) .",

The regions of the F gene encoding the cleavage site were mutated to change the amino acid sequence from the virulent motif RRQKR\u2193F of NA-1 to an avirulent motif GRQGR\u2193L of LaSota. The mutated nucleotides are underlined in red (below), and original sequences were underlined in green (above). (B) The modified nucleotides of the recovered rmNA-1 were confirmed by sequencing. F gene from the recovered viruses was amplified by RT-PCR and subjected to sequence. The regions encoding the cleavage site were boxed. (C) Investigate the capability of CPE and the trypsin-dependent infectivity in cell culture. DF1 monolayers were infected with NDV strains, LaSota, rmNA-1 and rNA-1 at an MOI of 0.01. The infected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10% normal allantoic fluids as exogenous protease. The cells were photographed at 36 hpi with an inverted microscope at 200\u00d7 magnifications (Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan).
