Introduction of the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae B and multivalent pneumococcal vaccines in developed countries including Australia has significantly reduced the overall burden of bacterial pneumonia. With the availability of molecular diagnostics, viruses are frequently detected in children with pneumonia either as primary pathogens or predispose to secondary bacterial infection. Many respiratory pathogens that are known to cause pneumonia are also identified in asymptomatic children, so the true contribution of these pathogens to childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains unclear. Since the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, very few comprehensive studies from developed countries have attempted to determine the bacterial and viral aetiology of pneumonia. We aim to determine the contribution of bacteria and viruses to childhood CAP to inform further development of effective diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies.",

Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are collected from both cases and controls to detect the presence of viruses and bacteria by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); pathogen load will be assessed by quantitative PCR. The prevalence of pathogens detected in cases and controls will be compared, the odds ratio of detection and population attributable fraction to CAP for each pathogen will be determined; relationships between pathogen load and disease status and severity will be explored.",

Recent estimates suggest that approximately 156 million new cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occur each year with nearly 2 million deaths among children aged <5 years; most deaths occur in low resource settings [1] . The burden of childhood CAP in developed countries is lower (approximately 50 cases per 1000 children-years), however, CAP remains an important public health concern with increasing antibacterial resistance, evidence of replacement disease with non-vaccine strains, and emergence of new respiratory pathogens [1] [2] [3] . In Australia, CAP is an important cause of hospitalization of children with 2-8 hospitalisations per 1000 child-years for children < 5 years old [4, 5] . In Western Australia, the incidence is especially high for Aboriginal children who have been observed to be at 14 times higher risk of hospitalisation for CAP than non-Aboriginal children [6] .",

Gram-negative enteric bacteria and atypical intracellular bacteria, for example, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae have also been reported to cause childhood CAP [20, 22] . M. pneumoniae appears to be detected more commonly among school-aged than in younger children [23, 24] . The burden of bacterial pneumonia has reduced significantly in Europe, the United States and Australia since the introduction of both the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae B and multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) into the routine immunization schedule [5, [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, bacteria still remain as important causes of pneumonia in many developing settings where the vaccines have not been introduced or recently introduced [29, 30] .",

The incidence of invasive pneumococcal infection has been observed to be higher during increased seasonal activity of some respiratory viruses including influenza, RSV, parainfluenza 3 and adenovirus [35, 36] . Further, in clinical trials in South Africa, conjugate pneumococcal vaccination resulted in overall decrease in virus-associated pneumonia, suggesting interactions between respiratory viruses and pneumococcus in causing pneumonia in children [37] . In Australia, ecological data has demonstrated a reduction in viral pneumonia following introduction of PCV vaccines (Fathima P et al CID 2017 [39] . The patients with viral-bacterial co-infection has been reported to suffer for treatment failure, longer ventilator support and increased likelihood of intensive care unit admission [10, [40] [41] [42] .",

With many cases being associated with respiratory viruses (Table 1) , the current immunization strategies focussing exclusively on bacterial pneumonia are expected to have modest impacts on further pneumonia case reduction. Apart from the annual influenza vaccines, to date there are no other licensed vaccine for any respiratory viruses that can be used in the community. It is critical to understand the relative contribution of specific bacterial and viral pathogens to childhood CAP, to help inform development of new therapeutics for pneumonia, including antivirals and to support ongoing efforts for new preventive strategies such as vaccines targeting RSV and parainfluenza which are in advanced stages of development. This question constitutes the primary aim of this study. Additionally, unveiling relationships between pathogen load and pathogenicity will inform tools for more accurate attribution of the infective cause of CAP, allowing better diagnosis and management of pneumonia cases using antibiotic and antiviral therapies. Finally, this study will identify emergent serotypes of pneumococcus causing CAP among vaccinated children, informing the design of future pneumococcal vaccines. [11, 15] . The Swedish study was relatively underpowered (93 x-ray confirmed cases and 240 controls) to assess attributable risk for a range of viral pathogens and in the US study, healthy controls were not enrolled contemporaneously or from all study sites which might have biased the inference for specific pathogens. The proposed study is the first case-control study of pneumonia aetiology in Australia in post-PCV vaccination era, where 250 radiologically confirmed hospitalized pneumonia cases (n=250) will be compared to 250 age-group frequency matched healthy controls for both the presence of respiratory pathogens and quantitative load of pathogens. The proposed study is expected to address the limitations from previous case-control studies through recruitment of an appropriate number of cases and controls contemporaneously and from the same study sites.",

The primers, probes and protocols for determining the viral load for a range of viral pathogens in NPS specimens have been developed by PathWest (Sikazwe, C et al unpublished data). A nucleic acid standard is developed using purified plasmid DNA or in vitro transcribed RNA, and the concentration of the DNA and/or RNA standard is quantified using fluorescent dyes. Following this, a standard curve is generated from serial 10-fold dilutions of the DNA and/or RNA standards mentioned above. The viral load in the NPS specimen is quantified by interpolating from the appropriate standard curve. The viral load is reported in viral copies/mL.",

Gram-negative enteric bacteria and atypical intracellular bacteria, for example, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae have also been reported to cause childhood CAP [22, 24] . M. pneumoniae appears to be detected more commonly among school-aged than in younger children [25, 26] . The burden of bacterial pneumonia has reduced significantly in Europe, the United States and Australia since the introduction of both the conjugate Haemophilus influenzae B and multivalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) into the routine immunization schedule [7, [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, bacteria still remain as important causes of pneumonia in many developing settings where the vaccines have not been introduced or recently introduced [31, 32] .",

With many cases being associated with respiratory viruses (Table 1) , the current immunization strategies focussing exclusively on bacterial pneumonia are expected to have modest impacts on further pneumonia case reduction. Apart from the annual influenza vaccines, to date there are no other licensed vaccine for any respiratory viruses that can be used in the community. It is critical to understand the relative contribution of specific bacterial and viral pathogens to childhood CAP, to help inform development of new therapeutics for pneumonia, including antivirals and to support ongoing efforts for new preventive strategies such as vaccines targeting RSV and parainfluenza which are in advanced stages of development. This question constitutes the primary aim of this study. Additionally, unveiling relationships between pathogen load and pathogenicity will inform tools for more accurate attribution of the infective cause of CAP, allowing better diagnosis and management of pneumonia cases using antibiotic and antiviral therapies. Finally, this study will identify emergent serotypes of pneumococcus causing CAP among vaccinated children, informing the design of future pneumococcal vaccines.",

We will report the crude odds-ratio of detection for each respiratory pathogen among CAP cases versus controls. We will also report the adjusted odds ratio for each pathogen after adjustment for demographic factors (e.g. age, sex, presence of a smoker in the household, premature birth), and presence of other pathogens using multivariable logistic regression (referred to as model 1). The adjusted odds-ratio of detection among cases versus controls will be taken to be indicative of the pathogenicity of each organism; the higher the odds-ratio the higher the indicative pathogenicity of that microorganism. Using the proportion of cases infected and the adjusted odds-ratio for each pathogen, the population level attributable-fraction of CAP will be calculated using the method of Greenland and Drescher [66] . The frequency and proportion of cases and controls having more than one respiratory virus or bacteria detected will be reported. Where numbers permit, a multivariable regression model will be developed to explore the existence of significant pair-wise interactions between respiratory pathogens and disease status. Disease severity for the cases will be assessed using Respiratory Index of Severity in Children score (RISC) based on Australian children growth standard [67] [68] [69] . Where numbers permit we will explore the relationship between detection of specific pathogens and severe disease (versus control status) using multivariable logistic regression models as described for model 1 (model 2).",
