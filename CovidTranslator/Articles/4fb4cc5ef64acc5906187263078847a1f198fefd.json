Among various causes of disease spread, airborne dispersion has previously been considered to be an important factor that could not be controlled by preventive measures to stop the spread of disease that focus on direct and indirect contact. Forecasting and predicting airborne virus spread are important to make time for developing strategies and to minimise the damage of the disease. To predict the airborne spread of the disease a modelling approach is important since field experiments using sensors are ineffective because of the rarefied concentrations of virus in the air. The simulation of airborne spread during past outbreaks required improvement both for farmers and for policy decision makers. In this study a free license computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was used to simulate airborne virus spread.",

Since 2000, in Korea there have been four foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks. During the 2010/11 FMD outbreak, 3.35 million pigs were slaughtered to prevent virus spread, which resulted in a decrease in animals of 32%, while the direct damages, including the costs for farm compensation and preventive measures, reached 3 billion USD and related damages, including costs to feed companies, the decrease in exports, and reduced consumer demand, reached 4 billion USD, as estimated by KREI (2011) . Therefore, there is an urgent need to minimise the damage from livestock infectious diseases at the early stages of any outbreak by means of preventive measures. The outbreak of livestock infectious diseases has not be blocked because of the various transmission routes, and tracking of the spread has failed due to the difficulties in field monitoring. There are three routes by which FMD can be transmitted by livestock aerosols and surface contact to respiratory organs (Weber & Stilianakis, 2008) ; 1) direct contact from infected animal to healthy animals, 2) indirect contact by infected objects such as the human body, vehicles, equipment, feed, refrigerators, and 3) airborne spread through airflow. The airborne spread of livestock disease has not be considered in terms of taking preventive measures due to a lack of information. However, a comprehensive counterplan should consider not only direct and indirect contact transmissions but also airborne transmission via considering the continuously changing airflow patterns from weather conditions.",

Geering and Lubroth (2002) suggested a disease management strategy based on; 1) denying access of the virus to susceptible host animals, 2) avoiding contact between infected and susceptible animals, 3) reducing the number of infected or potentially infected animals in livestock populations, and 4) reducing the number of susceptible animals. Most of the preventive measures used to date have focused on a blockade of direct and indirect transmission of virus regardless of the airborne transmission. Multiple factors should be considered in making preventions and forecasting, but there are a substantial number of difficulties basing this on field experiments, including a lack of basic information on virus spread, the presence of an incubation period, and having a detection problem or a delay in disease declaration.",

Viruses that are suspended in the air exist as fine particles; there are limitations to capturing these viruses when using an air sampler and also to detect a quantitative dose of the virus under field or laboratory conditions. Modelling approaches of airborne virus spread have been developed to get over these limitations. Mart\u00ednez-L opez et al. (2010) suggested an FMD spread model that used seven variables; (1) movement of animals, (2) local spread, (3) infectivity, (4) zones, (5) resources for depopulation, (6) movement restriction, and (7) surveillance. Stevenson et al. (2013) suggested a spatial and stochastic simulation model was developed for epidemiological investigation and considered airborne spread, animal movement, farm operating methods, incubation period, indirect contact, susceptibility, and other factors. Their model calculated the probability of infection by the distance from the infected farms via airborne spread of virus using weather information and look-up tables. However, considerable numbers of quantitative variables relied on expert opinions and required more research. foot-and-mouth disease GIS geographical information system PM10 particle matter under 10 mm SAS severe acute respiratory syndrome SEM-EDX scanning election microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy TCID 50 50% tissue culture infective dose TIN triangular irregular network WDAS weather data acquisition server WebFoS web-based forecasting system b i o s y s t e m s e n g i n e e r i n g 1 2 9 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 1 6 9 e1 8 4 Aerodynamics models have been developed to predict the airborne spread of livestock diseases (Krumkamp et al., 2009; Mayer, Reiczigel, & Rubel, 2008; Seo et al., 2014) . Among various simulation techniques, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which solves mathematically aerodynamic problems in various research fields, has been considered. Compared to the Gaussianbased simulation models that are currently used for virus spread simulations, CFD has advantages with respect to specific airflow analysis, complex topographical information and related facilities in a local area that has a concentration of livestock farms (Hong et al., 2011; Seo et al., 2014) . Because a considerable number of the livestock facilities in Korea are concentrated in hilly and mountainous areas to avoid complaints from residential areas due to livestock odours, and because there are therefore complex airflows, a CFD approach is very important for analysing airborne virus spread caused by airflow.",

            "text": "The airborne spread of livestock disease such as FMD has been suggested for some time by many researchers groups (Seo, 2012; Tellier, 2006; Weber & Stilianakis, 2008) . Airborne virus has been known to survive approximately 24e48 h in the air, and livestock aerosols generated from farms can carry livestock viruses from an infected farm (Brockmeier & Lagar., 2002; Kristensen et al., 2004; Tellier, 2006) . The aerosols that are generated from pig farms are suspended on feed particles in the air and are regenerated on a floor surface (Heber, Stroik, Faubion, & Willard, 1988; Takai et al., 1998) . The particle sizes of the livestock aerosols that are suspended in the air are therefore 2e3 mm (Cambra-L opez, Aarnink, Zhao, Calvet, & Torres, 2010); these particles can stay in the air for two days and be dispersed throughout the airflow that is affected by ventilation and weather conditions. The appropriate conditions for FMD viruses be attached to livestock aerosols are >60% relative humidity and <27 C air temperature and the survival of the virus is little influenced by the effects of strong UV radiation (Cannon & Garner, 1999) . Therefore, livestock aerosols combined with FMD virus can move far away from their source, following air currents when environmental and weather conditions permit virus survival. The emission rate of an FMD virus can be described in units of TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose), which represents a capacity of virus that infects 50% of the tissue cells. The emission rate of a livestock airborne virus increases with the size of the farm and the number of infected animals that excrete the virus; pigs excrete a large amount of viruses, approximately 10 5.6 e10 8.6 [TCID 50 ] animal \u00c01 d \u00c01 , which can be compared to the other ruminants, such as cows and sheep, which excrete by 10 4 -10 5 [TCID 50 ] animal \u00c01 day \u00c01 . On the other hand, the amounts of critical virus concentration for infection are 10 3 TCID 50 for pigs and 10 TCID 50 for other ruminants (Alexandersen and Mowat, 2005) , which shows that the FMD propagation route tends to move from windward for pig farms to leeward for dairy and sheep farms. Gloster, Doel, Gubbins, and Paton (2008) have studied detecting airborne virus in the air from 20 FMD infected pigs. A peak concentration of FMD virus was detected two days later from an initial excretion of airborne virus. Doel, Gloster, and Valarcher (2009) and Ha et al. (2012) screened instruments for their effectiveness at sampling airborne viruses when using FMD virus and PRRS (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome) virus respectively; both sets of results showed that bio-samplers (SKE biosampler, SKC Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) and potable air samplers (PCXR8, SKC Inc., Pennsylvania, USA) were effective at capturing airborne virus. However, these results were not directly relevant to applications at field situations during and outbreak because the experiments were conducted in restricted and controlled small spaces using relatively high virus concentrations compared to virus concentrations found in the air from infected farms. Brockmeier and Lager (2002) and Kristensen et al. (2004) conducted field experiments for airborne virus spread using animals, and various measurement techniques suggested by international organisations and research groups such as WHO (2006) , Nicoll (2006) , Aledort, Lurie, Wasserman, and Bozzette (2007) , and Sagripanti and Lytle (2007) . Li et al. (2007) and Gao, Niu, Perino, and Heiselberg (2009) attempted to discover a mechanism for airborne virus spread by using tracer gases. However, field and laboratory experiments still have limitations due to point measurements, unstable weather conditions, low virus concentrations in the air, and complex detection techniques. b i o s y s t e m s e n g i n e e r i n g 1 2 9 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 1 6 9 e1 8 4 2.2.",

            "text": "Aerodynamic modelling for the prediction of airborne livestock virus spread has attempted to overcome the limitations of field experiments. Gaussian based dispersion models were initially used for aerosol modelling and they have been updated to enhance their modelling accuracy by considering the effects of UV radiation, air temperature, virus mortality during airborne phase due to dehydration, and airborne spread (Lighthart and Mohr, 1994) . The RIMPUFF (puff diffusion model developed by Ris\u00f8 DTU national laboratory for sustainable energy, Denmark) were also used to predict airborne FMD virus spread (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2001) , and complex topographical information was the most important factor for forming virus dispersion patterns when using dispersion modelling (Mikkelsen et al., 2003) . To predict airborne virus spread, the RIMPUFF model, which is a regional and largescale dispersion model, was used with a virus production model (VPM) Thykier-Nielsen et al., 1993) . Other cases have been analysed regional aerodynamic dispersion by simulating complex airflow patterns through hills and mountainous regions while considering land utilisation characteristics (Astrup, Jensen, & Mikkelsen, 1997; Mikkelsen et al., 1997) . Gloster, Blackall, Sellars, and Donaldson (1981) estimated airborne FMD virus spread from infected farm as point sources by using a Gaussian plume model, and predicted an airborne spread distance of 10 km assuming 10 8 infectious units per pigs per day; over 65% of the infection was shown to be related to a particle size of <6 mm. Casal, Moreso, Planas-Cuchi, and Casal (1997) simulated airborne spread of virus using ALOHA (areal location of hazardous atmospheres, NOAA, 1992), which resulted in a 7 km dispersion distance. Donaldson, Alexandersen, Sorensen, and Mikkelsen (2001) mentioned that the airborne dispersion of FMD virus excreted by cows and sheep can be 100e200 m. Krumkamp et al. (2009) used an effective reproduction number to estimate the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus spread, and suggested that close contact and exposure to virus are very important for disease spread. Regional airflow patterns play an important role on airborne FMD virus spread, as suggested by Mayer et al. (2008) , who used a Lagrangian-particle model. Gloster et al. (2010) gathered data from research groups among six countries to estimate airborne FMD virus spread using their own Gaussian-Lagrangian models based on the epidemiological investigation of the 1967 FMD outbreak in UK. After modelling analysis, risk factors on airborne virus spread from infected farms were divided into four stages including high-risk, mid-risk, lowrisk, and no-risk.",

            "text": "Aerosol concentrations generated from livestock farms alter according to multiple factors including the nature of the facility, ventilation conditions, feed, animal species, animal age, and environmental conditions; animal activity, breeding density, and air humidity conditions are also important. Haeussermann et al. (2008) suggested a dynamic model to predict the relationship between aerosol concentration and related factors using the PM 10 (particle matter under 10 mm) concentration in pig farms by means of the ventilation rate, animal activity, feed supply method, internal air humidity, animal weight, and the other factors. Other research groups have also suggested that the aerosol concentration generated from livestock farms depends on the number of animals, the animal age, activity, the ventilation rate, the internal air temperature, the air humidity, feed types, and other factors (Gustafsson, 1999; Kim, Ko, Lee, Park, & Kim Chi, 2005; Puma & Maghirang, 2000) . As shown in Table 1 , the virus emission rate from pigs was higher than for the other animal species, whilst the critical virus concentration of FMD infection for cattle was 130 times lower than that for pig. This finding indicates that pigs can emit more FMD virus into the air and that cattle can be infected via airborne FMD spread with a higher probability (S\u00f8rensen, Mackay, Jensen, & Donaldson, 2000) . However, these results were established in single animal-oriented laboratory experiments, and there are few studies for addressing FMD virus emission rate at a farm scale. As stated earlier the virus can be spread in the air by attachment to aerosols in a livestock house (Cox, Aggarwal, Statham, & Barnett, 2003; Seo et al., 2014; Treanor, 2004; Wright and Webster, 2001) . Using this assumption, it is possible to analyse airborne virus spread in terms of livestock aerosol dispersion using CFD techniques. The emission rate of a livestock aerosol in each livestock building was derived from a previous study conducted by Takai et al. (1998) , as shown in Table 2 , which is reconstituted by inhalable and respirable dust concentrations were measured in a substantial number of farms according to the animal species, animal ages, floor type of the livestock house, and aerosol size.",

OpenFOAM is an open source CFD code that has no license cost for research as well as commercial purposes. It was developed by an objectoriented program system under LINUX OS and the C\u00fe\u00fe program language, while solving fluid dynamic problems by means of the finite volume method in Eq. (1). This program has advantages in terms of cost reduction, expandability of hardware scale, reduction in computation time, simplicity in adding functions, and production of a private programms that allows users to easily access the program package, although OpenFOAM is still a difficult program to operate since it has a text user interface, few manual options and little information. An integrated total solution package was developed for airborne virus spread, including complex topography modelling, airflow analysis, virus spread analysis based on the weather forecasting in real time, and result derivation. However, this approach does make it possible for laymen to handle CFD following a manual written specifically for the application. The governing equations are the NaviereStokes equations that solve the mass, momentum, and energy conservative equations for fluid mechanics.

It was necessary to calculate the CFD simulation model as rapidly as possible to enable real-time forecasting of airborne virus spread based on 48-h weather forecasts updated at three-hour intervals and provided by KMA. If all information was simulated at the same time, including the airborne spread and airflow pattern, prompt forecasting would be impossible due to calculation time involved. Therefore, a two-step simulation was conducted to dramatically save on computation time and to maintain result accuracy; first, airflow patterns for eight wind directions and fifteen wind speeds from 0.2 to 3.0 m s \u00c01 at 0.2 m s \u00c01 intervals were simulated and saved as basic airflow data; then, the scalar transport for airborne virus was modelled from infected livestock farms for next 48 h using the saved basic airflow data. (4) An integrated server system was then constructed to inter-work real-time information that was obtained through steps (1)e(3). Then, CFD simulation was conducted at three-hour intervals to predict airborne virus spread based on the interworking between the specific topography, farm information, and real-time climate forecasting. The time dependent scalar transport of the airborne virus was calculated using preceding data file for calculating airflow patterns according to wind speeds and wind directions.

The virus emission rate from an infected single animal were suggested by means of controlled laboratory experiments using real animal and tissue culture experiments in terms of the TCID 50 unit (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2000) . However, these data could not be used for practical purposes to calculate the overall virus emission rate with regard to livestock aerosols in infected livestock houses because emissions alter according to the various characteristics of the livestock houses. The aerosol concentrations were measured according to the animal species, age, and floor type, as shown in Table 4 ( Takai et al., 1998) , which can be used as practical data to calculate the livestock aerosol emission rate in terms of farm scale. The calculation algorithm for the FMD virus emission rate was suggested by a combination between virus-based scientific information and field-measured aerosol concentration according to animal and livestock characteristics, as shown in Fig. 6 . The emission rate of livestock aerosols was calculated by the algorithm while considering the animal, livestock house, and farm operation characteristics in Eq. (6); then, the value was used as input data for the generation rate at the point sources for each infected livestock house. The equation used included information as follows: the livestock aerosol concentration according to the animal species, ages, and floor types in accordance with the database table, number of animals in the infected livestock farm, recommendation of livestock density, time interval for CFD simulation (typically set at 1 s), and an assumption of an infection ratio of 10%, which can be changed by the user for each outbreak situation when making decisions concerning preventive measures.",

A buffer area, 56.6 by 56.6 km in size, extended the boundary of the computational domain to stabilise the inflow and outflow airflow pattern at each boundary and to obtain solution convergence. Without this buffer area, the airflow that started from the mountainous boundary would demonstrate unpractical airflow patterns and wind speeds. Therefore, the buffer area was added by stretching the mountainous area until the height of ground surface had a value of 0 m. To simulate the airborne spread of livestock aerosols, point sources were assumed at the coordinates of each coordinate for the livestock farms in the research site. This approach was taken because farm size is very small compared to the overall computational domain sized by 40 km \u00c2 32 km \u00c2 1.7 km height, and a livestock aerosol emitted from a ventilation system that included roof and windows was quickly dispersed in the air and was dispersed through an airflow pattern ",

Using the basic airflow database, a real-time scalar transport simulation for the airborne spread of FMD disease was conducted every three-hour to forecast the subsequent 48 h using three routine processes by interworked with weather forecasting, as shown in Fig. 9 : 1) database construction for weather forecasting and measurement from AWSs and weather stations, 2) CFD simulation of virus scalar transport using the weather forecasting and time-dependent airflow pattern using precedence basic airflow database, and 3) forecasting a system update on the web-based forecasting system for airborne spread of livestock disease.",

The CFD model carried out computations based on steady-state conditions during each case for the wind directions and wind speeds, which is not common in real situations. Continuously changing the wind speed would establish an unsettled airflow pattern from the inlet boundary to the outlet boundary and make convergence difficult. Therefore, meteorological measurements for different locations at the same time could not be used to validate the CFD simulation model at steady-state conditions. Figure 11 shows an example of the wind speed distribution map from the CFD computed airflow pattern at a 1.0 m s \u00c01 wind speed and with a north-easterly wind direction; a red colour represents an increase in the wind speed to over 1.0 m s \u00c01 passing through a hilly and mountainous area and a blue colour represents a decrease in the wind speed to under 1.0 m s \u00c01 . For two selected periods, while maintaining similar wind conditions for more than 6 h, wind measurement data at two of the AWSs (Iljuk and Baegam) and weather stations were compared to the CFD computed airflow pattern for its validation. The CFD computed wind directions at each observation location were shown an error of 1.2% compared with measured wind directions, as shown in Table 5 . The difference in the average wind speed between the CFD computed values and AWS measured values showed an error of 11.6%, which is reasonable for CFD validation, particularly when considering the size of the computational domain.",

For a real-time forecasting system, a calculation algorithm was developed to dramatically save on computational time while focusing on the scalar transport of an airborne virus using updating weather forecast and an already computed airflow pattern according to various wind directions and speeds. The CFD computed spread pattern for airborne livestock aerosol spread showed complex behaviour when there was aerosol generation from an infected farm, dispersion by complex topography, and changing by airflow patterns, as shown in Fig. 12 . In this case, a high concentration of livestock aerosol was predicted to stagnate beyond the mountains (in red) (in web version) due to an eddy, and its airborne spread was well simulated by means of changing the wind directions and speeds.",
