By introducing these genes into peripheral blood memory B cells and culturing these cells with factors produced by follicular helper T cells, CD40L and IL-21, we convert them to highly proliferating, cell surface BCR positive, Ig-secreting B cells with features of GC B cells including expression of activationinduced cytidine deaminase. We generated cloned lines of B cells specific for respiratory syncytial virus and used these cells as a source of antibodies that effectively neutralized this virus in vivo. This method provides a new tool to study GC B cell biology, signal transduction through antigenspecific B cell receptors, and for the rapid generation of high affinity human monoclonal antibodies.",

BCR expression on polyclonal immortalized human B cells would facilitate selection of antigen-specific cells on basis of binding of antigen to the specific BCR, while production of antibodies enables selection of B cell clones on the basis of functional activities of the secreted antibodies. While na\u00efve and memory B cells express cell surface BCR, they do not secrete Ig.

To test this hypothesis we isolated human CD27 + memory B cells from peripheral blood and introduced BCL6 and Bcl-xL into these cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Transduced cells were cultured on irradiated CD40L expressing L cells (CD40L-L cells) in the presence of IL-21, a factor produced by follicular helper T cells in the GC that strongly induces proliferation of B cells 9. The transduced cells were visualized by their expression of the markers \u0394NGFR (BCL6) and GFP (Bcl-xL) (Fig. 1a) . Cells expressing both BCL6 and Bcl-xL rapidly increased in frequency to more than 95% of the culture within a two-week period (Fig. 1b) . In addition, these cells exhibited a clear expansion advantage compared to cells expressing BCL6 or Bcl-xL alone (Fig. 1c, left panel) . When the cell populations were sorted and cultured independently, the BCL6+Bcl-xL transduced cells showed enhanced expansion compared to BCL6 and Bcl-xL-only transduced cells (Fig.  1c, right panel) . Normal human B cells rapidly differentiate to antibody-producing plasma cells when cultured on CD40L-L cells in the presence of IL-21 10 which is accompanied by a decrease in expression of surface BCR and MHC class II and an increase in expression of CD38 2. In contrast to non-transduced cells or cells expressing Bcl-xL only in the same culture, BCL6-only and BCL6+Bcl-xL cells both retained BCR expression and were HLA-DR hi CD38 int (Fig. 1d) confirming that BCL6 inhibits B cell differentiation 17,18.",

By retroviral introduction of the GC-expressed genes BCL6 and Bcl-xL, we converted peripheral blood memory cells into GC-like B cells that can be maintained for prolonged periods in culture. Both BCL6 and Bcl-xL are involved in the GC response: BCL6 is required for GC formation 13,14, while Bcl-xL is an important anti-apoptotic factor in the GC 7. The BCL6+Bcl-xL transduced cells express markers for human GC B cells including AID, CD38, CXCR4 and ICOSL, the later has been shown to be important for GC formation 29.",

We suggest that they are centrocyte-like in nature, perhaps representing a small subset of centrocytes, since the transduced B cells express a functional BCR, which has long been held as a characteristic of light zone centrocytes 1. This BCR participates in the selection by follicular dendritic cells which occurs in the light zone 5. Moreover, expansion of these B cells is depended upon CD40 signaling and the dark zone is mostly devoid of CD154 + (CD40L) T cells, while these activated T cells are present in the light zone. In addition, nuclear translocation of NF-kB, which is induced by CD40 signaling, has only been observed in B cells in the light zone 30.",

Although AID was expressed in all clones that were derived from BCL6+Bcl-xL transduced CD27 + peripheral blood memory cells, the level was variable. Moreover we did not observe isotype switching in these cells over time, indicating that AICDA expression by itself is insufficient to drive this process at least in the time frame and culture conditions we applied. In contrast we did observe the occurrence of somatic hypermutations at relative low frequency in subclones of one RSV-specific B cell clone. Screening of the mAb containing culture supernatant of these subclones on RSV infected cells demonstrated variations in binding capacity. This result suggested that the additional VH gene mutations of some subclones resulted in changes in the antigen-binding affinity. These data raise the possibility that ongoing AID-mediated mutational activity in B cell clones can be used to select higher (or lower) affinity clones obviating the need for deliberate molecular engineering of the relevant Ig genes. It is conceivable that in some cases mutations in the Ig genes of established cloned B cell lines need to be avoided. We show that following introduction of Id3 into B cells that already overexpress BCL6 and Bcl-xL AICDA levels are strongly reduced consistent with findings published by Sayeg et al. 28 . Thus overexpression of Id3 should prevent ongoing AID-mediated mutational activity, if a frozen VH/VL repertoire is required. Despite the expression of AICDA in BCL6 and Bcl-xL-transduced IgG, IgM and IgA memory B cells we did not observe CSR in these cells (data not shown). This might be related to the different requirements for AID-mediated SHM and CSR 31,32.",

Both methods provide a tool for rapid isolation of potential therapeutic antibodies.

Both the method described by Traggiai et al. and ours utilize human B cells of exposed individuals to select monoclonal antibodies against a variety of microbes without the need of recent vaccination of the donors. However, in contrast to B cells transformed by EBV 34 all B cell lines obtained with BCL6+Bcl-xL genetic programming stably express high levels of a signaling-competent, membrane-bound BCR. This high level of cell surface BCR facilitates isolation of B cells on the basis of antigen binding which greatly increases the frequency of antigen specific cells and abrogates the need for extensive subcloning. Whereas the generation of antigen specific clones using the EBV method takes 3 months 33, the genetic programming approach reduces this to 1 month. The fact that rare B cells can be easily cloned compares our method favorably with a recently described single cell cloning approach used to isolate influenza-specific antibodies 35 . In this study, Ig DNA was isolated 7 days after influenza vaccination from a population of CD27 high CD38 high B cells which contained a relatively high frequency of only several Influenza virus-specific B cells. The feasibility of this technique depends on a relative high frequency of antigen-specific B cells, that can be obtained by vaccination or very recent exposure to a microbe 35,36. As discussed above expression of AID in the genetically modified clones may be utilized to select antibodies with higher affinity providing an advantage compared to the EBV transformation and single cell PCR methods as platforms to generate human monoclonal antibodies.",
