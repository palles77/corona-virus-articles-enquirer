Thirty pigs seronegative to PRRSV and H. parasuis were divided into four groups. Group A pigs (10 animals) were inoculated with both virus and bacteria; group B pigs (10 animals) were inoculated with bacteria, group C pigs (five animals) were inoculated with virus and group D pigs (five animals) were kept as negative controls. All pigs of groups A and C became infected with PRRSV, according to virological techniques used (immunohistochemistry, virus isolation and virus serology). Lung, heart and tonsils were the most frequently immunolabeled tissues, and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells were the target for PRRSV in all tissues. All pigs in groups A and B also became infected with H. parasuis based on immunohistochemical and bacterial isolation results. Serosal surfaces, lung and tonsils were the most frequently immunolabeled tissues, and bacteria were found in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells as well as within neutrophil cytoplasm. No differences in terms of bacterial distribution or localization in tissues of pigs of groups A and B were detected. These results suggest that there is no influence of the previous infection with PRRSV in the occurrence of H. parasuis infection. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

            "text": "Clinical and diagnostic evidence have suggested that epizootic outbreaks caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in a naive herd mediate a sequence of clinical events that include a high prevalence of secondary viral and bacterial infections, mainly in nursery and fattening pigs . However, experimental demonstration of this hypothesis has not been fully accomplished. Furthermore, until now, trials to demonstrate direct association between PRRSV and Pasteurella multocida (Cooper et al., 1995; Carvalho et al., 1997) , Haemophilus (H.) parasuis (Cooper et al., 1995; Solano et al., 1997) , Salmonella cholerae-suis (Cooper et al., 1995) , Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (Pol et al., 1997) , swine influenza virus (Van Reeth, 1997) , porcine respiratory coronavirus (Van Reeth et al., 1996) , and Aujeszky's disease virus (Albina et al., 1995) have been unsuccesful. Attempts to demonstrate an interaction between PRRSV and Streptococcus suis (Galina et al., 1994; Cooper et al., 1995) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Albina et al., 1995; Van Alstine et al., 1996; Thacker et al., 1998) , have shown contradictory results. On the other hand, Kubo et al. (1995) found more severe lesions in dually infected pigs with PRRSV and H. hyorrhinis than in singly infected pigs.",

Pigs from groups A and B (n 10) were intratracheally inoculated with 29755 H. parasuis strain, serovar 5, at a total dose of 10 7 colony forming units (CFU) per animal on day 5 post-viral inoculation (PVI). Pigs from group D (n 5) were kept as negative controls. Pigs were necropsied at the time of death, and the surviving pigs were euthanised at day 10 PVI. Pigs were bled at days PVI 0 and 5, and at the time of death. At necropsy, tissues including brain, lung, heart, liver, spleen, tonsil, thymus, intestine, lymph nodes (superficial inguinal, submandibular and mediastinal) and kidney were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, and sectioned at 4 mm. One section of each tissue was included in the study, except for lung and brain. Four sections of lung (including one from cranial lobe, one from medial lobe and two from caudal lobe) and three sections of brain (including one from cerebellum, another from pons and the other from cerebral cortex) were examined.",
