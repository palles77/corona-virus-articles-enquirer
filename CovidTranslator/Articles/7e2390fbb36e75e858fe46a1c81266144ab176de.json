Because laboratory biosafety related to testing for MERS-CoV shall be handled separately in the guideline on laboratory testing, this guideline will not address it in detail. The use of preventive antivirals after being exposed to MERS-CoV is also excluded from this guideline due to the lack of evidence to support it.",

An RPE should be discarded after leaving an isolation room and exchanged when it becomes wet or soiled in an outpatient clinic or open space [11, 15, 31, 32, 34, 35] . Wearers of RPE should be trained in how to don and fit it properly, and it should be checked at all times whether it seals tightly to the wearer's face [32, 33] . The room of a patient receiving mechanical ventilation may have a high degree of viral contamination, and HCWs entering it are at a very high risk of exposure. In such cases, use of a PAPR is recommended because the tight fit of a highly efficient mask cannot be ensured due to perspiration while performing medical procedures, and prolonged use can cause breathing discomfort. All HCWs should be trained how to don and adjust a PAPR properly, and fit checking should be performed before and during use.",
