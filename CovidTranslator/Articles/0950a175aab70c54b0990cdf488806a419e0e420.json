The cells were cultivated in a rotating bed bioreactor system (Z \u00ae RPD system, Zellwerk GmbH) on the aluminium oxide based ceramic Sponceram \u00ae for four weeks. The ceramic discs were loaded with PLGA microspheres releasing BMP-2. For this experiments a system was used which allows the parallel cultivation of four bioreactors. The used bioreactor containers were manufactured of disposable material for single use application. During the cultivation glucose and lactate concentrations were measured and after the experiments histological stainings were performed (DAPI, von Kossa and alizarine red). Furthermore the concentration of alkaline phosphatase was measured in medium samples and mRNA of the cells was isolated to perform RT-PCR to investigate the expression of different bone markers.",

For the cultivations scaffolds with a diameter of 65 mm and a thickness of 3 mm were used. The PLGA microspheres were produced by solvent evaporation and at a size of about 50 \u00b5m. The BMP-2 concentration in the microspheres was about 0.05 \u00b5g per mg PLGA. The total amount of BMP-2 in the dynamic cultivations was 2.5 \u00b5g in each bioreactor. The BMP-2 release and the concentration in the medium was measured with a BMP-2 ELISA (Quantikine, R&D Systems) The BMP-2 concentration in medium samples of bioreactor 4 decreases almost linear from 875 pg/ml to zero pg/ml in the first 16 days of the dynamic cultivation.",

The reactor is equipped with a Sponceram \u00ae ceramic, which is served as a rotating bed. In the standard operation mode the bioreactor is half filled with media (50 mL) and the Sponceram \u00ae is rotating with 0.5 rpm. This way the cells on the ceramics have alternating contact to medium and gas-filled headspace improving cell nutrition and oxygen supply. The aim of the parallel cultivation of four bioreactors was, to test the reproducibility of the system, which is important for GMP 1 Institute of Technical Chemistry, Leibniz University of Hannover, Callinstr. 5, 30167 Hannover, Germany Full list of author information is available at the end of the article standards in clinical application. The bioreactors were integrated in a GMP conform breeder with a control unit for GMP conform documentation and evaluation of pH, oxygen and temperature. Furthermore a sterile sampling of media during the cultivation is possible. The dynamic cultivations were performed over a time period of 28 days and the cells were cultivated in osteogenic medium with dexamethasone, l-ascorbate and \u03b2-glycerol phosphate.",

The glucose consumption increased during the cultivation indicating a continuous cell growth on the ceramics. Also DAPI staining of the cell seeded ceramics showed a high density of cells on the scaffolds. Furthermore the concentration of alkaline phosphatase was measured daily (Sigma fast TM , Sigma Aldrich). The amount of the secreted alkaline phosphatase decreased during the cultivation period which is an indication for advanced osteogenic differentiation. Also the expression of various genes involved in the osteogenic differentiation of cells was verified. Different intensities of the gene expression in the four bioreactors was observed; especially the gene expression in bioreactor 1 was obviously higher. SEM pictures of the cell seeded ceramics showed thick cell layers on Sponceram \u00ae . Small round beads and a fibrous structure were noticeable. The beads might be cells, which are embedded in the extracellular matrix and the fibrous structure could be a hint for Collagen reposition. To verify the osteogenic differentiation of the cells von Kossa-and alizarine red stainings were performed. Both stainings showed high amounts of calcified matrix on all four ceramics. Also the alkaline phosphatase staining (Sigma fast BCIP, Sigma Aldrich) was successful and showed high amounts of secreted alkaline phosphatase on all four scaffolds.",

The histological staining showed matrix calcification of the cells on every ceramic. Also the expression of typical bone markers was shown. In summary, osteogenic differentiation of adMSC on Sponceram \u00ae , caused by BMP-2 released from PLGA microspheres, was demonstrated and the reproducibility of the osteogenic differentiation in four parallel cultivations was demonstrated.",
