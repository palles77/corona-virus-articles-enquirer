The representations are slightly more complicated in the case of protein sequences where one has to contend with 20 basic units, the amino acids, but ingenious schemes from 2D to 20D abstract graphs have been utilised to represent them too [2] . The graphical representation methods remain, to date, among the best to 'see' the base distribution in a DNA or a RNA sequence and follow the variations in a family of genes. This has enabled many applications of the techniques, for example, generation of new plant varieties [3] , determination of origins of the SARS-coronavirus [4] , identification of conserved regions in influenza virus neuraminidase gene for vaccine design and development [5] .",

An expected tendency would be to consider those methods which discriminate among sequences more clearly than others, i.e., sequence differences should lead to more pronounced differences in their descriptors. In order to address this issue, we had earlier carried out a comparative analysis of several different methods [10] and showed that results of some of the methods correlate strongly with results of other methods, implying that the sequence descriptors arising from the various approaches essentially map the same features; those that do not exhibit high level of correlation could be considered as mapping some attributes unique to those schemes. In this brief commentary, we work out the descriptors for two families of sequencesthe globin genes of Homo sapiens and the envelope genes of flavivirusesto determine precisely how much discrimination is evidenced in a selected group of methods.",

The 2D methods are primarily based on the Cartesian coordinate system. In the Nandy plot [11, 12] , the four nucleic acid bases are assigned to the four axes of a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. A given sequence is plotted based on the distribution of its bases in the corresponding direction; in computations for this note adenine (A) was assigned to the negative x-axis, cytosine (C) to the positive y-axis, guanine (G) to the positive x-axis and thymine (T) to the negative yaxis. The weighted average of the x-and y-coordinates of each point of a sequence of length N represents the centre of mass. The Euclidean distance between the origin and the centre of mass provides a quantitative graph descriptor, termed as the graph radius (g R ). A variant of this method can be seen in the Yau plot [13] in which two quadrants are used with the first quadrant addressing thymine (T) and cytosine (C), and the second quadrant denoting guanine (G) and adenine (A). However, the authors of this method did not prescribe a sequence descriptor. As a result, for the purpose of this commentary, Nandy's graph radius method is used to define the sequence descriptor of the Yau plot for comparative analysis.",

In both methods, the bases of a given sequence are plotted on the corresponding line along in the direction of the x-axis and then subsequently, joined by straight lines. The sequence descriptors are represented by the leading eigenvalues computed from M/M matrices of each graphical method. The Wang-Zhang [16] and Ji-Li TB curve [17] deviate from the aforementioned systems in that, the Wang-Zhang plot employs a binary system in which the presence and absence of particular bases are represented by 1 and 0, respectively. There are three such systems: non-A, non-C and non-G. If, for example, the non-A configuration is used, A will be denoted with 0 and the remaining bases by 1. In the Ji-Li TB curve, the given sequence is mapped into nodes which are then connected sequentially in order to obtain three curves, R-Y, M-K and W-S.

The graph and sequence descriptor for our sequence in the Yau et al. [13] plot are given in Fig. 2 The D G matrix in Randic 2D model. [14] proposed four horizontal equidistant parallel lines labelled as A, T, G, and C from top to bottom. To plot the nucleic acid sequence, the bases are numbered along the x-axis, and straight lines are drawn from individual points on the four parallel lines according to the bases occurring in the sequence (Fig. 2.3 ). An M/M matrix method is used to determine a descriptor for the given sequence ATGAAGGCAA. The entries of the M/M matrix are determined by dividing the Euclidean distance D E between two vertices of the zigzag curve by the graph theoretic distance D G between the two vertices. As an example, if we take the first base A and the eighth base C of our sequence, then the corresponding matrix element is obtained by taking the ratio of Euclidean distance between the A and C bases, i.e., 58 (Table 2. 3.1), to the number of edges between A and C, which is 7 here ( Keeping one of such groups, such as purine, as central line, and cytosine (C) and thymine (T) as the peripheral lines, we can plot a graph. Repeating the same process for the other groups, we get a total of 6 ( 4 C 2 ) combinations of plots. For each of them, the 2 peripheral lines can also be exchanged. In total, 12 (6 \u00d7 2) plots can be obtained.",

            "text": "Our sample data consist of four members of the Homo sapiens globin family and four mosquito-borne human-infecting members of the flavivirus group (Table 2. 2.1). Among the globin genes, which are about 444 bases in length, the alpha globin being CG-rich is quite different from the beta globin group which are primarily AT-rich. The flaviviruses are of approximately 1500 bases in length and the Dengue virus is quite different in its adenine richness from the other three flaviviruses [9] . The sequence descriptors should therefore yield sufficiently different numbers to discriminate among the globin genes and between the flaviviruses, which will be compared with the computed standard deviations of the results as percentages of the corresponding descriptor average; higher the percentage, more is the discriminatory power of the method. Table 3 .1 shows the results for the flavivirus group of envelope genes and the globin group of genes. As can be seen, the two oldest of the current crop of graphical representations, viz., Nandy plot and Randic-3D plot, show the best clear discriminatory power. For example, in case of the flaviviral envelope genes, the Nandy plot descriptor ranges from 72.61 for DENV2 to 8.91 for WNV and as low as 4.51 for ZIKV; the Randic 3D plot shows descriptors ranging from 221.99 for DENV2 to 113.57 for WNV and 156.22 for ZIKV. The observation that there is a wide difference between DENV2 and, WNV and ZIKV which reflects the base distributions in their genetic composition was first mooted in a previously published paper in detail [9] . On the other hand, the same three sequences yield descriptor values, respectively, of 1485.51, 1503.43, 1495.21 in the Song-Tang representation and 1487.07, 1505.02, 1496.75 in the Randic 2D representation, showing very little distinction between DENV2, WNV and ZIKV. This is reflected Base Coordinates in the standard deviation (SD) as a percentage of the average descriptor values (SD%) for each method; while the Nandy and Randic 3D plot descriptors yield SD% 133.51 and 29.60, respectively, for the envelope genes; in case of the Song-Tang and Randic 2D methods, the SD% are 1.03 and 1.27, respectively. Higher SD% implies greater differences in the sequence descriptor values showing increased discriminatory power among related sequences. This is also borne out by the analysis of the human globin genes (Table 3 .1) where, again, the Nandy and Randic 3D plots show the best discriminatory power among the seven methods tested. Our analysis, therefore, indicates that it would be advisable to consider methods like the Nandy plot, Randic 3D plot and others of the same ilk, not analysed in this brief commentary, that have the ability to distinguish among sequence differences for analysis of DNA/RNA sequences of a family of closely similar genes. However, given a random collection of gene sequences of a variety of related and non-related sequences, the methods not meaningful in the above analysis could come into effect; for example, between the globin and flavivirus gene sets, the Randic 2D method or the Song-Tang method yield sequence descriptors that are different by at least one order of magnitude (Table 3 .1). The non-similar sequence descriptors would tend to provide distinct separate groups where similar sequences, such as the family of flavivirus genes for instance, having almost identical descriptor values in these methods would cluster together, thus providing an easy way of discriminating between divergent sequences. In this context, it is relevant to recall that in the chemical domain it has long been known that no single topological index can discriminate graphs uniquely [19] . Perhaps, it may be worthwhile to introduce a concept of some \"super-descriptor\" on the lines of topological \"super-index\" first proposed by Bonchev, Mekenyan and Trinajstic [20] or extracted principal components (PCs) derived from the collection of individual sequence descriptors [21] as some combination of descriptors from various methods for discriminatory power of inter-gene and intra-gene sequences.",

In a retrospective study of flaviviral envelope gene and human globin genes, where one element of each sample set is known to be characteristically different from the rest, the Nandy and Randic 3D methods have yielded results that allow good discrimination between the sequences, whereas the other methods were unable to reflect similar outcome. However, on a broader scale, for classification of a set of close and distant sequences, the remaining five graphical representation methods are able to discern diverging sequences. We suggest that a kind of \"super-descriptor\", which is a blend of elementary descriptors, could be considered to distinguish sufficiently between inter-and intra-gene sequences. ",
