            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic virus that causes severe respiratory illness accompanied by multiorgan dysfunction, resulting in a case fatality rate of approximately 40%. As found in other coronaviruses, the majority of the positive-stranded RNA MERS-CoV genome is translated into two polyproteins, one created by a ribosomal frameshift, that are cleaved at three sites by a papain-like protease and at 11 sites by a 3C-like protease (3CL pro ). Since 3CL pro is essential for viral replication, it is a leading candidate for therapeutic intervention. To accelerate the development of 3CL pro inhibitors, three crystal structures of a catalytically inactive variant (C148A) of the MERS-CoV 3CL pro enzyme were determined. The aim was to co-crystallize the inactive enzyme with a peptide substrate. Fortuitously, however, in two of the structures the C-terminus of one protomer is bound in the active site of a neighboring molecule, providing a snapshot of an enzyme-product complex. In the third structure, two of the three protomers in the asymmetric unit form a homodimer similar to that of SARS-CoV 3CL pro ; however, the third protomer adopts a radically different conformation that is likely to correspond to a crystallographic monomer, indicative of substantial structural plasticity in the enzyme. The results presented here provide a foundation for the structure-based design of small-molecule inhibitors of the MERS-CoV 3CL pro enzyme. Figure 6",

MERS-CoV belongs to Betacoronavirus clade c, along with the closely related bat coronaviruses HKU4 (BatCoV-HKU4) and HKU5 (Corman et al., 2014) . A conspecific virus that shares 85% genome sequence identity with MERS-CoV has been isolated from the Neoromica capensis bat (Corman et al., 2014) . Recent work showed that introduction of a clinical isolate of MERS-CoV into dromedary camels resulted in mild respiratory illness followed by persistent shedding of infectious virus from the upper respiratory tract (Adney et al., 2014) . Taken together, these results suggest that MERS-CoV originated in bats, with camels serving as the carrier for human infection.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and the usually milder human coronaviruses (HCoV) HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43, share a common organization of their polycistronic positive-strand RNA genomes. On the 5 0 end of the MERS-CoV genome are the two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) encoding nonstructural proteins (nsps), followed by genes encoding the spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid structural proteins. The genomic mRNA of ORF1a is translated into the polyprotein pp1a. A longer polyprotein (pp1ab) is the product of a ribosomal frameshift that joins ORF1a together with ORF1b (van Boheemen et al., 2012) . ORF1a encodes two proteases: a papain-like protease (PL pro ) and a 3C-like 'main' protease (3CL pro ). The 3CL pro , which in its essential role in viral replication is also called the 'main protease' (M pro ), processes the polyprotein at 11 cleavage sites (consensus: LQ#A/S), including those flanking it (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Anand et al., 2002; Hsu et al., 2005; Li et al., 2010; Muramatsu et al., 2013; Stobart et al., 2013) . The essential function and conservation among 3CL pro s from different coronaviruses make the main protease an attractive drug target for currently known and future emerging coronaviruses (Anand et al., 2002 , Zhao et al., 2013 Hilgenfeld, 2014) . In contrast, the structural and accessory genes encoded towards the 3 0 end of coronavirus genomes exhibit too much variability to serve as targets for broad anti-coronaviral agents . Coronaviral 3CL pro s are chymotrypsin-like proteases except that they use cysteine as the nucleophile in a catalytic dyad instead of serine in a catalytic triad (Anand et al., 2002) . SARS-CoV 3CL pro exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution (Graziano et al., 2006) , but the homodimer is the enzymatically active form (Chen et al., 2006; Shi & Song, 2006; Shi et al., 2008) . Each monomer consists of three structural domains: domains I and II contain the catalytic site and chymotrypsin-like scaffold and are connected to a third C-terminal domain via a long loop (Yang et al., 2003; Shi et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2010) . In this study, we report the structure of a catalytically inactive variant (C148A) of MERS-CoV 3CL pro in three different crystal forms, each providing distinct biological insights.",

The cells were lysed with an APV-1000 homogenizer (Invensys APV Products, Albertslund, Denmark) at 69 MPa and centrifuged at 30 000g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 mm polyethersulfone membrane and applied onto a 5 ml HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed to baseline with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole to 500 mM in buffer A. Fractions containing recombinant protein were pooled, concentrated using an Amicon YM10 membrane (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA), diluted to an imidazole concentration of about 25 mM with 50 mM Tris pH 7.2, 200 mM NaCl buffer and digested overnight at 277 K with His 6 -tagged TEV protease (Kapust et al., 2001; Tropea et al., 2009) . TEV protease digestion, which removed the His 6 affinity tag and amino acids encoded by sequences that facilitate Gateway cloning, resulted in a native protein product devoid of cloning artifacts. The digest was applied onto a 5 ml HisTrap FF column equilibrated in buffer A and recombinant protein emerged in the column effluent. The effluent was incubated overnight at 277 K with 10 mM dithiothreitol, concentrated using an Amicon YM10 membrane and applied onto a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corporation) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine buffer. The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to about 20 mg ml \u00c01 (as estimated at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 43 890 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 derived using the ExPASy ProtParam tool (Artimo et al., 2012) . Aliquots were flashfrozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 193 K. The molecular weight of the product was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy.",

Further optimization of the initial crystallization hits was performed by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Three different crystal forms were obtained. Crystal form I appeared from condition E10 of Morpheus by mixing 2 ml protein (20.3 mg ml \u00c01 ) with 2 ml well solution [0.1 M Tris-Bicine pH 8.5, 0.03 M diethylene glycol, 0.03 M triethylene glycol, 0.03 M tetraethylene glycol, 0.03 M pentaethylene glycol, 10%(w/v) PEG 8000, 20%(v/v) ethylene glycol] and sealing the drop over 500 ml well solution.

All crystallization plates were incubated at 292 K and crystals generally appeared within 1-5 d. For data collection, crystal forms I and II were retrieved directly from the crystallization drop using a LithoLoop (Molecular Dimensions) and flash-cooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen without the need for additional cryoprotectant.

Ma, Y. Xiao & R. Hilgenfeld, unpublished work) as a search model, after stripping away all nonprotein atoms and changing non-identical residues to alanines. Molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP from the CCP4 suite (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010; Winn et al., 2011) . Two molecules (chains A and B) were located in the asymmetric unit using data to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution. The sequence for chains A and B could be fitted completely into the electron-density maps. A third molecule (chain C) was also found, but only residues 11-190 fitted well into the electron-density maps. Inspection of the initial electrondensity maps after rigid-body refinement with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011) revealed a large region of well defined 2mF o \u00c0 DF c and mF o \u00c0 DF c electron-density features for protein residues adjacent to residues 11-190 of chain C. This indicated that residues 191-306 of chain C, corresponding to domain III of MERS-CoV 3CL pro , had undergone a large rigid-body movement. Therefore, another round of molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP by fixing the positions of chains A, B and residues 11-190 of chain C and then using residues 200-306 of chain C as a search model. Inspection of the new electron-density maps revealed a good fit of residues 200-306, confirming the alternate conformation of this region of the protein in chain C. The model was refined after several rounds of manual rebuilding and inspection with Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) , refinement with REFMAC5 and addition of water and other solvent molecules.",

In all crystal forms a biological homodimer was observed that is similar to other 3CL pro enzymes such as those encoded by TGEV (Anand et al., 2002) , HCoV-229E , SARS-CoV (Yang et al., 2003) , IBV-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 (Fig. 1) The two molecules of the homodimer are approximately perpendicular to one another. Each monomer is composed of a core chymotrypsin-like fold that is formed by two domains (domains I and II, residues 1-187), a connecting loop (residues 188-204) and a C-terminal -helical domain (referred to as domain III; residues 205-306). The C-terminal domain mediates dimerization; it has been demonstrated to play a key role in controlling the dimer-monomer equilibrium in other 3CL pro family members (Anand et al., 2002; Shi et al., 2004 Shi et al., , 2008 Shi & Song, 2006) .",

There are no intermolecular interactions that mimic the binding of a peptide product in this crystal form. On the other hand, in both crystal forms II and III there is unambiguous electron density in the active site of protomer A that corresponds to the intercalated C-terminal tail residues of a neighboring protomer (Figs. 2a and 2b ). The C-terminal residues Met301-Gln306 correspond to the P6-P1 sites of the autoprocessed product of the mature enzyme and therefore represent an enzyme-product complex. Surprisingly, in crystal form III, a significant shift in the orientation of domain III in protomer C, which inserts its C-terminal tail into the active site of protomer A, is observed (discussed below). Analysis of the crystal packing environment suggests that protomer C in crystal form III represents a crystallographic monomer, as it does not form a homodimer with any symmetry mate.",

Inspection of the superimposed homodimers reveals that the chymotrypsin-like cores (domains I and II) align very closely (r.m.s.d. of 0.9 \u00c5 over 164 C -atom pairs). When the domain III structures of MERS-CoV pro and SAR-CoV 3CL pro are aligned, the r.m.s.d. is higher (1.4 \u00c5 ). The even higher r.m.s.d. that is obtained when the complete homodimers are superimposed (2.2 \u00c5 ) reflects a small shift in the orientation of domain III (Fig. 3b ). There is a high degree of conservation of the residues that form the active site in the 3CL pro enzymes of MERS-CoV, BatCoV-HKU4 and SARS-CoV. The residues surrounding the P1 0 , P1 and P2 substrate-binding pockets are particularly well conserved, which may be advantageous for the design of broad-spectrum inhibitors targeting coronaviral 3CL pro enzymes (Fig. 4) ",

            "text": "The fortuitous capture of an enzyme-product complex in crystal forms II and III at high resolution (1.55 and 1.97 \u00c5 , respectively) permits a detailed analysis of the intermolecular interactions and provides structural insight into substrate specificity and catalysis, complementing studies of other 3CL pro enzymes (Anand et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2003 Yang et al., , 2006 Lee et al., 2005 Lee et al., , 2007 Xue et al., 2008; Hilgenfeld, 2014) . In crystal form II, residues Met301-Gln306 of protomer D are intercalated in the active site of protomer A. The interactions between the C-terminal peptide (product) residues and the active site are illustrated in Fig. 5(a) . The S1 pocket, which is formed by residues Leu27, His41, Phe143-Ser150 and His166-Glu169, is occupied by the P1 residue Gln306, which is required for efficient processing by all coronavirus 3CL pro family members (Hegyi & Ziebuhr, 2002; Chuck et al., 2010 Chuck et al., , 2011 . The side chain of Gln306 is held tightly in the S1 pocket near the catalytic dyad formed by His41 and Ala148 (Cys148 in the wild-type enzyme; Anand et al., 2002) via hydrogen bonds between (i) the P1 Gln306 N \"2 atom and the side-chain O \"1 atom of Glu169 ( the Gln306 O \"1 atom and the His166 N \"2 atom (2.7 \u00c5 ), (iii) the backbone carbonyl O atom of Gln306 and the N \"2 atom of His41 (3.0 \u00c5 ) and (iv) the Gln306 OXT atom and the backbone amide of Gly146 (3.0 \u00c5 ). Additionally, the main-chain amide N atom of Gln306 is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone carbonyl O atom of Gln167 (3.0 \u00c5 ). The Ala148 C atom is located 3.3 \u00c5 away from the backbone carbonyl C atom of Gln306, confirming that Cys148 would be appropriately positioned to act as the catalytic nucleophile in the active enzyme. Residue Ser1 from protomer B forms hydrogen bonds from its side-chain O (2.8 \u00c5 ) and backbone amide N (2.8 \u00c5 ) atoms to the carboxylate side chain of Glu169 of protomer A, an interaction that is important for the maintenance of the biological homodimer structure (Anand et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2010) . Likewise, residue Ser1 from protomer A also forms analogous hydrogen-bond interactions with Glu169 in protomer B. The P2 residue, Met305, is nestled into a hydrophobic pocket formed by His41, Gln167, Met168, Asp190, Lys191 and Gln192. In addition to hydrophobic contacts with neighboring side-chain residues, the backbone amide N atom of Met305 is hydrogen-bonded to the O \"1 atom of Gln192 (2.9 \u00c5 ). Modeling of additional residues into the S2 pocket suggests that this site favors bulkier hydrophobic residues, in accord with the observed preference for leucine in this position of most natural processing sites in the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV polyproteins (Chuck et al., 2010) . The S3 site is occupied by Val304, the side-chain atoms of which occupy two alternate conformations in crystal form II. Val304 is surrounded by residues Met168, Glu169 and Gln192. Hydrogen-bonding interactions between the backbone amide N atom of Val304 and the backbone carbonyl O atom of Glu169 (3.0 \u00c5 ) and between the backbone carbonyl of Val304 and the backbone amide N atom of Glu169 (2.9 \u00c5 ) contribute additional stabilizing interactions. The P4 residue, Val303, is bound to the S4 site, which is formed by residues Gln192-Gln195, Met168, Glu169 and Leu170. The side chain of Val303 stacks against the hydrophobic side chain of Leu170. The S5 site is occupied by Gly302, which is held in place primarily by a watermediated hydrogen bond to the Gly302 amide N atom (2.9 \u00c5 ) and to the His194 N 1 atom (2.8 \u00c5 ). Met301 begins to protrude into the solvent space and does not form any significant contacts with the active-site region other than stacking against the side chain of His194. Comparison of the activesite structure between the enzyme-product complex observed in crystal form II and those of the unbound structures from crystal form I illustrates that upon substrate/ product binding, the residues forming the S1 pocket do not undergo any significant conformational shifts. Slight adjustments of the rotamers of side chains of residues His41, Gln192, Met168, Glu169 and His194 are observed, which are likely to facilitate substrate binding (Fig. 5b) ",

Although protomers A and B exhibit the canonical MERS-CoV 3CL pro homodimer structure, in order to insert its C-terminal tail into the active site of protomer A, protomer C has undergone a substantial conformational change. The core chymotrypsin-like part (domains I and II) of protomer C aligns well with those of protomers A or B (r.m.s.d. of 0.6 \u00c5 over 163 C -atom pairs; residues 11-190), but when domains I and II of the three protomers are aligned then domain III of protomer C occupies a very different position than it does in protomers A or B (Fig. 6a) . Conversely, if domain III of protomers A and C are superimposed then they align well (r.m.s.d. of 1.1 \u00c5 over 98 C -atom pairs; residues 200-306) but their chymotrypsin-like domains appear to have shifted relative to one another (not shown). Hence, the conformational change affects the relative orientation of the N-and C-terminal parts of the molecule but does not alter the conformations of the individual domains. The first ten residues in protomer C are disordered and the large shift in the orientation of domain III is mediated by a conformational change in the linker loop (Phe188-Ser204; residues His194-Val196 are disordered), in which it moves to cover the active site (Figs. 6b and 6c), potentially impeding access to substrates.",

Therefore, the distortion observed in protomer C of crystal form III is not a necessary prerequisite for the intermolecular interaction that mimics an enzymeproduct complex. The distortion of protomer C in crystal form III is probably tolerated because it does not form a canonical 3CL pro homodimer with a neighboring symmetry mate. A similar situation was observed in the crystal structure of infectious bronchitis virus IBV-CoV 3CL pro (PDB entry 2q6d; 40% sequence identity; Xue et al., 2008) . In the case of IBV-CoV 3CL pro three molecules were found in the asymmetric unit, with protomers A and B forming a homodimer and the C-terminal tail of protomer C inserted into the active site of protomer A. When domains I and II in protomers A and C were aligned, they were found to have very similar conformations (r.m.s.d. of 1.0 \u00c5 over 171 C -atom pairs), but substantial differences were observed in the orientation of domain III in the two molecules; namely, a 5 \u00c5 shift of domain III away from domains I and II. The authors claimed that protomer C represents a novel monomeric form of IBV-CoV 3CL pro that was induced by binding of the C-terminus in the active site of the homodimer. Structural alignment of domains I and II of MERS-CoV protomer C from crystal form III with protomer C from IBV-CoV yields an r.m.s.d. of 1.2 \u00c5 over 161 C -atom pairs (residues 1-193). However, there is a significant shift in the orientation of domain III between the two homologs (Fig. 7a) . One difference is that the entire linker region in the IBV-CoV homolog could be modeled into electron density, whereas MERS-CoV 3CL pro residues 194-196 are disordered, resulting in different conformations of the linker loops in the two homologs. Additionally, we do not observe the oxyanion loop (residues 143-148) adopting a 3 10 -helix as seen the IBV-CoV 3CL pro structure. This is likely to be due to differences in the conformation of loop residues 276-293 in the two structures. The larger shift in the position of domain III in the MERS-CoV 3CL pro structure than occurs in the structure of IBV-CoV 3CL pro causes these loop residues to come into close contact with the oxyanion loop in MERS-CoV 3CL pro . As a result, a hydrogen bond is formed between the backbone carbonyl of Leu287 and the side-chain Ser142 O atom, which may prevent the formation of a 3 10helix.",

Prior studies of monomeric forms of other 3CL pro enzymes revealed that there is very little or no activity in this state (Shi & Song, 2006; Shi et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2008) . The significant structural flexibility found in the interdomain linker loop region suggests that there may be significant structural plasticity in 3CL pro enzymes that allows the shift between dimeric and monomeric forms. Indeed, prior studies of SARS-CoV 3CL pro protease demonstrated that truncations of the linker loop between the chymotrypsin-like domain and domain III gave rise to a significant reduction in enzymatic activity, confirming that the proper orientation of the linker between domains I/II and domain III is important (Tsai et al., 2010) . Although protomer C of MERS-CoV 3CL pro crystal form III exhibits a large change in the orientation of domain III similar to what was observed in both IBV-CoV 3CL pro and engineered monomers of SARS-CoV 3CL pro , experimental insight into the enzymatic activity of this form is currently lacking. Therefore, more studies need to be conducted to determine whether this conformation is a crystallographic artifact or a monomeric form of the enzyme that is also populated in solution to some degree.",

The enzyme-product complex reveals the structural basis of substrate recognition by MERS-CoV 3CL pro on the N-terminal side of the scissile bond. The high degree of conservation between the active sites of coronavirus 3CL pro enzymes, particularly in their S2, S1 and S1 0 pockets, suggests that broad-spectrum coronaviral 3CL pro inhibitors can be developed. This objective will be facilitated by determining additional structures of 3CL pro enzymes alone and in complex with substrates and inhibitors.",
