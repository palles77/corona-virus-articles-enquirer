The medication soon enjoyed explosive growth, establishing Bayer Pharmaceuticals as the first modern pharmaceutical company. However, from the beginning the use of aspirin has been tempered by the occurrence of various side effects, the incidences of which were principally related to the dose of drug and duration of therapy.",

Principally because of this, and the fact that it was widely regarded as safe and effective, aspirin was 'grandfathered' into both prescription and over-the-counter use, without the performance of the myriad of pre-and post-marketing, randomised, clinical trials that today would be required for any new drug. While initially helpful, this has left the medical use of aspirin at some informational disadvantages. While there is an abundance of data from randomised, double-blind, clinical trials, of the long-term use of relatively low doses of aspirin in the prophylaxis of thrombotic vascular events, (affecting the heart, brain and other organs), and in the prevention of various cancers, there is a comparative paucity of such information attending the short-term use of often higher doses of aspirin, in what has been its main use, i.e. taking it for short times, usually without prescription, in the relief of acute pain, fever, and the symptoms of the common cold or influenza. This review attempts to gather available evidence about these applications in the context of contemporary use of this old-fashioned but still valuable drug.",

Here the efficacy data are presented, as far as possible, using as sources data from trials conducted for specific indications, and grouped under two main headings, 'Pain Relief' and 'Use in Fever, Common Colds or Influenza'.

In all these trials, efficacy was assessed by using a set of measurements which have served as relatively standard endpoints for measuring pain relief in prospective controlled trials, as used by Cochrane Library authors in compiling systematic reviews [5, 6] . Pain Relief (PAR), Summed Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR), Pain Intensity Difference (PID), or Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) over 4-6 h, are commonly used to calculate the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief. These results can then be used to calculate the relative efficacy of aspirin, compared to placebo or a comparator drug, the 95% confidence intervals, and the number-needed-to treat (NNT) for 1 subject to achieve the benefit. Other end-points have included counting the number of subjects in each test group who had to use a rescue medication, and employing a variety of subjective measures of pain intensity or pain relief, with the patient using visual analogue scales (VAS) to record their experiences quantitatively. The emphasis of this review is the efficacy and tolerability of aspirin, and other drugs are mentioned only for comparison.",

The diagnosis of migraine in all cases was in agreement with guidelines issued by the International Headache Society (IHS). Five of the studies used a placebo comparator, four used only an active comparator, and five used both. In most cases the active comparator was sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. The efficacies of all active comparators were superior to placebo. In the case of aspirin, both doses were equally effective, with NNTs of 8.1, 4.9 and 6.6, for 2-h pain-free, 2 h headache relief, and 24-h headache relief, for ASA vs. placebo. There was no additional benefit derived from the addition of 10 mg of metoclopramide (MTC) in relieving headache, but the combination did reduce associated nausea and vomiting compared to ASA alone. Sumatriptan 50 mg did not differ from ASA alone for 2-h pain-free or 2-h headache relief, but sumatriptan 100 mg was better than the combination of ASA \u00fe MTC for 2-h pain-free, but not for headache relief: no 24 h-relief data were given. The authors concluded that ASA 1000 mg is effective in treating acute migraine headaches, similar to sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg, and that addition of metoclopramide reduces nausea and vomiting but does not increase the relief of pain.",

There are some differences in efficacy that relate to the severity of the initial headache. In a publication comparing the efficacy of 1000 mg of effervescent ASA with 50 mg of sumatriptan in migraine, a subgroup analysis of 370 patients with severe pain at baseline vs. 564 patients with moderate pain at baseline, showed higher treatment responses to both drugs in those with moderate pain at baseline.

The first study [22] examined the effect of a single dose of 800 mg of aspirin in 139 patients with a sore throat due to a respiratory infection, compared to the outcome in 139 placebo-treated patients. The primary outcome measure was 2-h Sum of total Pain Intensity Differences (SPID), and ASA was much superior to placebo (p < 0.0001). For all secondary end-points, ASA also achieved statistically superiority compared to placebo. In the second similar study [23] , 68 patient received ASA 800 mg alone, 70 received ASA 800 mg \u00fe 64 mg of caffeine, and 69 received placebo. Under double-blind conditions, during a 2-h evaluation period, patients used different rating scales to assess pain intensity, change in pain, pain relief, and two qualities of throat pain, i.e. how swollen the throat felt, and difficulty in swallowing. Both active treatments were significantly more effective than placebo, for all efficacy measurements, from 30 min through 2 h, and ASA-plus-caffeine was superior to ASA alone. Specifically, in the 2 h SPID dimension, ASA was highly significantly superior to placebo (p < 0.01) [23] . Again aspirin was clearly effective. Many patients with sore throat dissolve 2 ASA tablets in warm water, gargle with this solution for 5-10 min, and then swallow the material. Despite its popularity, and that of combining dissolved ASA with topical local anaesthetics, the efficacy of this method of using ASA has not been evaluated.",

Ninety women, who suffered from pain and cramps during menstruation, participated in a 4-month study, taking no medication for their first two periods. Thereafter, they were randomised for their next two periods to receive identical-appearing tablets, containing either ASA 650 mg (30 subjects), or paracetamol 650 mg (30 subjects), or placebo (30 subjects). Pain scores were rated on a 4-point scale for the four menstruations. ASA and paracetamol were found to be equally, and significantly, more effective than placebo [24] . In a meta-analysis of 56 controlled trials of four common NSAIDS used in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea [25] , the efficacy of ASA could be assessed by various methods in 11 studies, encompassing outcomes in 486 patients given 650 mg ASA 4 times/day, compared to placebo. The response rate ratio (RRR), for ASA achieving at least moderate pain relief compared to placebo, was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.12, 2.29), though data were not easily combined. In an even earlier study published in 1982 [26] , an analysis was made of data relating to pain of female genital origin from over 4000 post-surgical, postepisiotomy patients, and those with uterine cramping from any cause, who had received 325 mg, 650 mg, 1300 mg of ASA or placebo for pain. Despite the analysis of a mixed bag of patients, statistically significant benefits compared to placebo were apparent for single doses of ASA from 325 mg to 1300 mg, and for a daily dose of 2600 mg [26] . Additional studies of more modern design and execution would be helpful in determining the magnitude of the benefit of ASA, and the correct dose for optimal OTC use. Despite scarcity of data, ASA appears effective in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea.",

A 'cold' typically presents with runny nose, cough, sore throat and chills. Occasionally there may be other accompanying symptoms such as fever, conjunctivitis, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and other vague symptoms. The condition has been reviewed in depth by Eccles [28] . While a cold is 'influenzalike', and may be accompanied by 'chills' or a real sensation of 'chilliness', fever is mild, uncommon and transient. In true influenza the symptoms are generally more severe, with prominent cough, sustained fevers, and onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the conditions are often confused at the onset. There is no cure for the common cold but, unlike influenza, the symptoms are mild and usually treated with over-the-counter remedies. Among these is aspirin, a drug believed to reduce symptoms although it cannot shorten or prevent the disease. Getting 'a cold' is one of the most frequent reasons for patients to consult a physician. Two studies done in the setting of 'cold' have already been quoted in the section on 'sore throat', and ASA was clearly effective [22, 23] . There are three additional controlled trials of ASA use in treating colds and fever, in one of which ASA treatment was compared to placebo, and in two of which it was compared to another active treatment. These studies are summarised in Table 3 .",

Detailed accounting for many of these factors is commonly lacking in epidemiological studies. The incidence of GI symptoms is usually ignored. Because of the large number of additional factors which attend the outcome of aspirin use in individuals or in specific groups, the exact risk of a dose of aspirin causing an Adverse Effect (AE) in any particular situation is quite variable. The GI recently reviewed safety of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs in general, pertains mainly to serious events, long-term use, in chronic conditions, and is limited to outcomes attributed to ulcers [36] . These data have no direct relevance to this paper, but furnish a background as to why some vague concerns among physicians and members of the public, about the GI safety and tolerability of ASA, may spill over into limiting short-term use of an effective compound in very different settings, i.e. to relieve the acute symptoms of pain, fever or a 'cold', in otherwise healthy adults.",

Among all AEs, the organ system most affected was the gastrointestinal tract (5.9% for ASA and 3.5% for placebo: NNH: 42). Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) for the GI system were lower (ASA: 3.1% and placebo 2.0%): even these rates may be overestimates because many of the ADRs were nausea or vomiting, possibly due to migraine itself (the majority of subjects included) rather than to drug. Results of this analysis bore a striking resemblance to those of the earlier-quoted Oxford study [37] though drowsiness was not observed. The term 'gastric irritability', previously reported as 3.7% [37] could not be used for direct comparison with the figures reported here, 5.9% gastrointestinal adverse events (GIAEs) or 3.1% gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions (GIADRs). Nevertheless, placebo AE rates were almost identical (11.0% [37] and 11.1% [44] ) (4) The recent Cochrane analysis [5] pertaining to migraine headache was primarily concerned with the efficacy of ASA in relieving the headache caused by migraine, and made no attempt to deal with the issue of GI tolerability. Nevertheless, an attached appendix summarising AEs in 13 published studies, reports some analysable data on GIAEs for 7 of the studies, yielding a rough estimate of GIAE incidence of 72 in a total of 1321 cases, 5.45%: no estimate of a placebo GI AE rate is possible, but the crude incidence rate is quite similar to the 5.9% rate in the Bayer IPD study [44] . Looking at many papers, 'somnolence' occurs as an AE only in studies involving migraine. (5) Most recently, an extensive detailed study of the incidence of all ASA-associated adverse effects has been completed [45] . This study was commissioned and supported by Bayer HealthCare, but not executed by them. A panel of 4 independent university professors, with combined expertise in Gastroenterology, Pharmacology, Clinical Trial Design, Data Collection/Analysis, Statistics, and clinical medicine in general, was commissioned by Bayer to execute the study, with no restriction of their access to any company data. In addition, one clinical scientist and one statistician, employed by Bayer, facilitated the panel's access to company records, and aided in locating relevant study details/results and clarifying in-house statistical analysis. A detailed account of the elaborate methodology has been published [45] . Individual patient data obtained from the records of all clinical trials involving ASA conducted by Bayer prior to March 31, 2008 , was entered into a new (IPD) database designed for the study. After establishment of clear inclusion criteria, 67 trials were considered suitable for objective analysis. Some studies that compared aspirin with either paracetamol or ibuprofen were also included because of relevance to widespread OTC use.",

There were no significant increases in abdominal pain in most analyses: in the large IPD study [45] , there were small, non-significant increases in incidences of abdominal pain and GERD-related symptoms (all of <0.1%).
