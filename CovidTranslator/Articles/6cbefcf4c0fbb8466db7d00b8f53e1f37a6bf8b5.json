According to the quantitative data, we observed relatively good completeness of IDSR monthly reports compared to timeliness. Timeliness is a general problem to countries implementing IDSR system across Africa, and this makes the public health authorities unable to take quick action and respond to the suspected health events [12, 25] . Facility level IDSR reports may not be sufficiently timely to pick up the outbreaks from community. The strengthened community level surveillance and verbal autopsy to detect unusual deaths can be a good approach to detect lower level health events and provide timely response [26] . In Malawi, a pilot study conducted in Lilongwe District in Central Region showed that mobile technologies had good opportunities to improve timeliness of HMIS reports [27] . However, concerning the different purposes of HMIS and IDSR system, a more integrated electronic IDSR system is essential for the health authorities to correspond the diverse demands. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/363713 doi: bioRxiv preprint African health ministries are quickly adopting mHealth solutions to improve disease surveillance and health programmes. Tanzania piloted an IDSR reporting system using SMS function and regular phones for report in 2011 [28] and further expanded it to be the national strategy for diseases surveillance using Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) technology linked with DHIS2 for the immediate reporting for IDSR [29] [30] [31] . Zambia tried to use DHIS2 mobile to enhance its malaria surveillance in Lusaka district and to improve case management and reporting [32] . Other mobile technologies including smartphone applications, patient monitoring devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), as well as laptops and tablets PCs connected with network service were piloted and implemented in various African countries [33] . Countries and development partners are eager to apply the mobile technology to capture real-time field data for surveillance and case management at the community level health care system [30, [34] [35] [36] [37] . However, notable issues were documented including technical, financial, infrastructural challenges, data security and medical supports during the design and implementation process of mHealth surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa countries [33] . Considering the complexity of public health works and needs of integration services at the community level [38] , the utilization of mobile technologies requires more rigorous studies to evaluate such innovations for programme implementation to become sustainable and scalable [39] .",
