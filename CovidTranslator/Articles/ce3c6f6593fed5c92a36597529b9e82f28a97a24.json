Expression of the transgene occurred after 8 weeks of age, at which time the murine Immune and central nervous systems are both fully developed. Directly associated with transgene expression, primary demyelination occurred and was accompanied by clinical abnormalities consistent with CNS disorders.

It is the most pronounced pathologic feature of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is responsible for much of the pathophysiology of disease. Evidence from epidemiological and biological studies of MS, as well as animal models of demyelinating diseases created to mimic MS, indicates that demyelination is multifactorial and complex with both genetic and environmental influences implicated. Consistent in MS and these models is an immune response in the CNS including an increase in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, macrophage and microglial activation, an increase in expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells, enhanced permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and upregulation of the T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine network'-' 0 \u2022 The Th1 inflammatory cytokine, IFN-y, is expressed in immune-mediated CNS disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS) and animal models of demyelinating disease, as well as in response to infections of the CNS by pathogens like viruses'\u00b7'\u00b7,..'.

The founder line, BGlO, expressed the MBP-IFN-y construct, and progeny were subsequently bred onto the BALB/cByJ (H-2\u2022) background to the F, level. Tissuespecific expression of the spliced transgene mRNA was demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction coupled with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) (Fig. 1b) by using primers flanking an intron within the construct. The correctly sized and spliced RT-PCR product was restricted to nervous system tissue and was not found in liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, lung, heart or thymus. Transgene expression at the RT-PCR level was found only after 8 weeks of age and was detected in both male and female mice. Expression of IFN-y protein was identified in the white matter of brains by immunofluorescence with an IFN-y-specific monoclonal antibody. Uniformly, male MBP-IFN-y transgenic mice showed symptoms of shaking, hind-limb weakness, hunched posture, ruffled appearance, swollen eyes and a wasting syndrome beginning as early as 8 weeks of age with increasing signs over time leading to death in 10 of 10 mice by 8 months of age. Disease was less frequent (SO%) in female mice and clinical signs did not appear until about 6 months of age (5 of 10 mice) . The founder mouse was female and did not develop clinical disease yet showed pathology in the CNS similar to that of other transgenic mice. Similar disease linkage to a particular sex has been observed in other murine models of immune-mediated disorders\u2022\u2022.zo. It is interesting that transgenic mice expressing IFN-y within the pancreas also showed increased disease in males over females \u2022\u2022, and this suggests an association of hormone responses with IFN-y-induced immune responses. Because expression of IFN-y did not occur until after 8 weeks of age, this allowed the CNS of the mice to develop normally before IFN-y exposure. This was advantageous because it provided a sudden, continuous source of IFN-y .. -................................................................................................................................................................................................................. that this promoter expresses transgenes early in life and continuously through adulthood, consistent with endogenous MBP expression\"\u00b7\" , and is most likely due to insertion site influences within the genome on the transgene. The observed changes are thus specifically attributable to the effect of lFN-y on a mature adult CNS and not owing to any developmental defect caused by transgene expression\" . Degradation of the myelin sheath and primary demyelination occurred in MBP-IFN-y-expressing transgenic mice as seen by both confocal and electron microscopy. Double-immunofluorescent labeling with antibodies to MBP and F4/80, a macrophage/microglia marker, revealed both the presence of a large number of activated macrophages/microglia throughout the brain of transgenic male and female mice as early as 8 weeks of age, and the colocalization of MBP within these activated macrophages/microglia (Fig. 2a) . The presence of myelin degradation products within phagocytic cells of the CNS suggested an active demyelination process. By contrast, similarly treated brain sections from nontransgenic and transgenic mice expressing a viral transgene, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus nucleoprotein (LCMV-NP)\", under the same MBP promoter, revealed that microglia expressing F4/80 throughout the CNS did not colocalize with MBP signal (data not shown). Further, the analysis of 6-month-old MBP-IFN-y transgenic mice by electron microscopy demonstrated primary demyelination (Fig. 3 ). Demyelinated axons, as well as axons with degenerating myelin sheaths, were found throughout the brain and adjacent to macrophage/microglia that were engulfing myelin debris. Although macrophage/microglia were commonly detected at the sites of demyelination, infiltrating T cells were only rarely observed (data not shown). Despite the presence of demyelinated axons, oligodendrocyte cell bodies were morphologically normal. The presence of morphologically normal oligodendrocytes suggests that expression of the transgene itself was not detrimental to these cells as had been previously reported in other transgenic systems 24 \u2022 Expression of IFN-y in the CNS resulted in increased expression of MHC class I and II molecules (Fig. 2, band c) . The level of MHC expression was equivalent in male and female mice and remained high over the lifetime of the animal. Immunohistochemical (Fig. 2, b and c) and double-label immunofluorescent analyses by confocal microscopy showed that the increase in MHC class I and II expression was widespread in both white and gray matter, and localized to endothelial cells, microglia and oligodendrocytes, but not to neurons or astro- .................................................................................................................................................................................................................... .",

Although the lack of MHC expression on neurons in vivo was anticipated from earlier publications\"\u00b7 26 , the absence NATURE MEDICINE \u2022 VOLUME 3 \u2022 NUMBER 9 \u2022 SEPTEMBER 1997 on astrocytes in vivo was unexpected'\u00b7' . Expression of MHC on astrocytes may require an additional factor or alternate pathway of induction, and this is currently under investigation. Previous work had established the ability of oligodendrocytes to express MHC class I and II under certain tissue culture conditions including in the presence of IFN-y (ref. 27, 28) as well as during viral infection'\u00b7Z9. The presence of activated microglia and astrocytes was demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to F4/80 (Fig. 2c) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (data not shown), respectively. By contrast, in transgenic mice before their 8th week of life, MHC class I and II expression was not detectable on oligodendrocytes and limited to a few endothelial cells and to cells within the choroid plexus. Microglia and astrocytes at this time and in nontransgenic mice showed limited expression of F4/80 (Fig. 2c) and GFAP (data not shown). Infiltrating lymphocytes were predominantly COS-positive (90o/o) and were found only in transgenic mice. These cells were scattered diffusely throughout the parenchyma of the brain and spinal cord (data not shown) . Their limited numbers (200 T cells per sagittal brain section) prohibited recovery from the CNS and analysis of their immune specificity. The T-cell infiltration correlated with an increase in endothelial cell expression of ICAM-1, an adhesion molecule involved in lymphocyte homing and migration (data not shown), and the presence of serum proteins, albumin and IgG, on the parenchymal side of CNS endothelial vessels (data not shown) suggesting leakage of the blood-brain barrier.\u2022 ARTICLES ...",
