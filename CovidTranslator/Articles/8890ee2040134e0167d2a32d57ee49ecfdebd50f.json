Lydia's parents wanted her to go to a particular school that she was not very keen on attending. So, even though her mother was not an animal lover Lydia's mother agreed to allow her to have a pet. Lydia really wanted a dog, but her parents refused this request and agreed that she could have either a cat or rabbit. Lydia ended up with both. During the most difficult times of Lydia's adolescent life she would often sit in her room with her cat, Cleo, or her rabbit, Bonnie, on her lap, petting it, as she listened to music to alleviate her sadness or worries.",

In some, these sudden growth spurts result in clumsiness or awkwardness. Important social changes that occur in adolescents include developing a larger social network and transitioning their trust to peers with these peers becoming more important to them than their biological family. These peer relationships can help facilitate the development of interpersonal competence, more specifically; autonomy, identity, self-expression, coping, trust, and empathy (Arnett, 2006; Cassels et al., 2017; Choate, 2014; Malone, 2016; Munsey, 2006; Sturman & Moghaddam, 2011; Tanner & Arnett, 2009 ; van Houtte & Jarvis, 1995) .",

These same authors define early adolescence as a period of independence versus dependence; of high self-consciousness and low self-disclosure. Pets have been found to serve as sounding boards, nonjudgmental listeners, and valuable confidants for adolescents seeking to share personal and private thoughts with someone who they can trust to maintain privacy (Marsa-Sambola et al., 2017) .",

Their personality and temperament are more clearly defined, and their commitment to forming and maintaining interpersonal relationships are stronger. Researchers (Arnett, 2006; Malone, 2016; Marsa-Sambola et al., 2017; Tanner & Arnett, 2009 ) have defined the late adolescent stage as closeness versus distance with relationships with parents, siblings, and peers changing. Specifically, the late stage adolescent may focus more on education, employment, important intimate relationships, and possibly marriage (Arnett, 2006) . Their relationships shift from being mainly dependent to one where power and responsibility is shared. They also demonstrate less commitment to family obligations (Arnett, 2006; Malone, 2016; Marsa-Sambola et al., 2017; Tanner & Arnett, 2009) . At this stage of life, children are developing their personal set of values, goals, and beliefs (Erikson, 1997) . As adolescents define themselves, their adopted values and beliefs may bring them closer to (or set them further apart from) their family and existing peer groups. In addition to the emotional changes occurring during this life stage, adolescents are also aware of physical changes that are happening to them and to their peers. How they interact with the world during this critical time helps to shape their roles in society and their future.",

Long-term relationships are explored in this stage, hopefully leading to the formation of ideals such as commitment, caring, and concern for others (Erikson, 1997) . The role of friendships during later adolescence cannot be understated (Valkenburg, Peter, & Schouten, 2006) .

The main process in late adolescence is identity formation and acceptance by their peers is paramount in this identity formation. Self-esteem and selfefficacy are important in the formation of their identity. Experimentation is also part of forming an identity. Experimentation in clothing, hairstyles, makeup, roles, piercings, and sexuality are common. Although they have a strong desire to be part of a group, they also want to be seen as unique. Particularly important at this time is the pressure from other peers who are antisocial who may influence the teenagers' antisocial behaviors through the use of drugs or alcohol (Arnett, 2006; Choate, 2014; Edenberg & van Lith, 2011; Griffin-Shirley & Nes, 2005; Levinson, 1978; Malone, 2016; Noppe & Noppe, 2004; Tanner & Arnett, 2009) .",

It is suggested that individuals in emerging adulthood are often in flux as they voluntarily enter into undergraduate or graduate education, where responsibility for their performance largely falls on their shoulders. They must choose the courses they take, the program of study they will follow in college, and how they will navigate the balance among academic and social pressures. While in some cases, parents may still be helping financially, often emerging adults are required to obtain a part-time job to help finance the education that they have chosen. Many emerging adults are in long-term relationships which may or may not result in full commitment by both parties, potentially causing trust issues to arise (Arnett, 2006; Malone, 2016; Munsey, 2006; Tanner & Arnett, 2009) .",

Adolescents, depending on their developmental stage, vary in their style of thinking, engagement with others, perceptions, and emotional reactions. Working with an early stage adolescent is very different from working with an emerging adulthood adolescence. Some examples of these differences include: early adolescents being more financially supported by parents, whereas an emerging adulthood adolescent might be far more financially independent. This is also important when we look at who the adolescent turns to for emotional support. An early adolescent might look toward a large group of peers for support while an emerging adulthood adolescent might turn to a significant other or a close friend. This difference could be critical when assessing possible interventions or supports for individuals.",

However, in the late 20th century, animals became more humanized by humans (Irvine, 2004; Tipper, 2011) . This domestication of working animals led to people keeping pets (Ault, 2016) . The number of US households that report having pets has been growing consistently since 1988 when formal accounts were initiated. According to the American Pet Products Association (APPA), in 1988, 56% of US households had a pet. Clancy and Rowen (2003) further delineated this data and report that 37% of US households had a dog and 30% had a cat. In the most recent APPA National Pet Owners Survey (2017-18), it was reported that 68% of US households indicated having a pet, an increase of 12% over the 20 years.",

These studies have indicated that these pets can act as counselors, confidants, best friends (Black, 2009; Cassels et al., 2017; Griffin-Shirley & Nes, 2005; Zilcha-Mano et al., 2012) , or even considered a sibling (Cassels et al., 2017) . Additionally, pets offer unconditional love and acceptance (Brown, Richards, & Wilson, 1996; Hanselman, 2001; Piper, 2014; Purewal et al., 2017) , the experience of accepting and receiving physical touch (Cassels et al., 2017; Fine, 2010; Piper, 2014) , an attachment to an object (Cassels et al., 2017; Marsa-Sambola et al., 2017; Piper, 2014; Zilcha-Mano et al., 2012) , or may encourage physical activity or health (Cloutier & Peetz, 2016; Winerman, 2017; Yam et al., 2012) . Furthermore, pets have been found to assist in emotional well-being (Black, 2009; Brown et al., 1996; Chandler, 2012; Piper, 2014; Purewal et al., 2017; Zilcha-Mano et al., 2012) and recovery from physical illnesses (Beetz, Uvn\u00e4s-Moberg, Julius, & Kotrschal, 2012; Cloutier & Peetz, 2016; Kyng\u00e4s, 2004) . van Houtte and Jarvis (1995) studied the impact of owning a pet on pre-adolescent's psychosocial development, which today would be called the early adolescent stage. Their study found that pet owning adolescents, aged 9-12, scored higher on measures of autonomy, self-esteem, and self-concept. Hanselman (2001) expressed that a pet can be seen by an adolescent as a parent (authoritative role) or as a peer. When the adolescent sees their pet as an idealized mother or as similar to themselves they engage in mutual reciprocity emotions with their pet. Also, when the adolescent is mothering the pet, it has been suggested that they are also mothering themselves. Black (2009) and others have indicated that adolescents demonstrate attachment behaviors toward their companion animals including trust, and revealing thoughts or feelings that they would not reveal to others. In fact, over 95% of adolescents in Black's study indicated that they drew pleasure from and reported close relationships with their pet. Furthermore, Black (2009) found a correlation between high self-esteem and adolescent attachment to pets, and that negative self-esteem correlates with loneliness in adolescents. Interestingly, Black (2009) also reported that even though female adolescents are more likely than males to engage in nurturing behaviors toward humans, male adolescents are equally likely to engage in nurturing behaviors to their pets. Black (2009) also reports that this caring for the pet can be a buffer against loneliness, and as suicidal behavior is often a correlate of loneliness, suicidal behavior can also be moderated.",

Additionally, they state that as pets can give and receive affection, pets are able to contribute or somewhat fulfil adolescent attachment needs. Furthermore, research has shown that having a pet in childhood or adolescence can assist in language acquisition, enhance verbal skills, and can elicit instant positive response in testing situations of memory, classification, and attention (Purewal et al., 2017) .",

Schvaneveldt et al.

According to Schvaneveldt et al. (2001) , adolescents typically want a pet for two reasons: physical companionship and social support. First, cuddling and petting with the animal and second that the adolescents believe the pets facilitate social connections to others.",

(2017) study with early adolescents, it was found that boys and dog owners indicate they have a stronger relationship with their pets when compared to girls and owners who have pets that are not dogs. Conversely, girls reported deriving more friendship and disclosed more to their pets than did boys. The study also found that the participants reported more satisfaction and experienced less conflict with their pets when compared to the same interactions with their siblings. Interestingly, the study found that girls reported more conflict with their pets compared to boys (Cassels et al., 2017) .",

The conclusions were that although many of the studies have methodological issues and weaknesses, overall the research consistently indicates that animals appear to promote healthy child development. Edenberg and van Lith (2011) recommended that longitudinal studies should be implemented to study the impact of companion animals on children's development.",

            "text": "In 2012, Zilcha-Mano, Mikulincer, and Shaver researched whether a pet can act as a secure base and how the adolescents' pet attachment orientation moderates the pet-owner benefits. In this study, they used the physical presence of a pet, compared to the subject thinking about their pet and no pet being present, on the number of goals set by the adolescent owner, and their confidence in achieving those goals. There was no difference between the physical presence of a pet and thinking about their pet. However, there was significant difference between the physical presence or thinking about their pet versus the no pet condition, in with the pet conditions, researchers saw in increase in goals and confidence. In the second part of the study, Zilcha-Mano et al. (2012) considered the impact of the participants pet attachment orientation (as either avoidant or anxious) on number of goals generated and confidence in achieving the goals. The number of goals set by the adolescent appears to be moderated by an avoiding attachment to their pet, in that this group set less goals. Participants who scored higher on either the avoidant or anxious pet attachment style, scored lower on confidence in achieving their goals. Similar findings were found for the safe haven moderator of the pet for the adolescent and that the attachment style also moderated the sense of the adolescents of having a safe haven or secure base. Overall Zilcha-Mano et al. (2012) conclude that the attachment theory works well in determining factors related to the human-human bond as well as the human-animal bond. Some authors (Cassels et al., 2017) have indicated that keeping a pet can have negative or unhelpful aspects. Particularly, that the pet could be a substitute for human relationships, may make the family home less hygienic, add expense, be destructive of possessions, and create potential rental housing restrictions such that when the family goes on vacation someone will need to either pay for or take care of the pet (Cassels et al., 2017; Schvaneveldt et al., 2001) .",

Families were randomly assigned to either the control group or the intervention group. The intervention involved increasing the family's activity with their pet dog over a 10-week period to increase physical exercise. They found that the intervention group had increased their level of physical activity over the 10-week intervention, lowered their body weights, and rated their quality of life as having been improved through activity. Havener et al. (2001) studied the impact of having a companion animal on early adolescence during dental procedures. They theorized that stress can lead to the development of irrational fears in early adolescents, that distraction is a good tactic when faced with relieving stress, and further capitalizing on the recent research related to human-animal connections, that utilizing a pet dog during a dental procedure might alleviate some of the adolescent stress. Many authors have suggested that pets provide comfort, a source of support, a distraction, and can provide love and affection to their human companions (Chandler, 2012; Fine, 2010; Havener et al., 2001; Piper, 2014) . Utilizing a control versus experiential group, Havener et al. (2001) found that the presence of a therapy dog did not result in a significant difference between the two groups for behavioral distress. Nonetheless, the study did find there was a significant difference between the two groups for physiological arousal.",

Zoonotic diseases can be caused by fleas, parasites, viruses, bacteria, and some types of proteins (Piper, 2014; Steele, 2008) . According to Steele (2008) , the most likely cause of an infection is a bite from an animal, and that approximately 30% of cat's bites and around 6% of dog bites often result in cellulitis, which then necessitates the use of antibiotics. Steele (2008) recommends that in order to avoid contracting a zoonotic disease, people who desire to have a pet and are immunocompromised, is to choose a pet that is less likely to have a disease that can be transferred to them. The author also recommends that these patients avoid kissing their pets or allowing the animal to sleep in their bed, and indicates that petting their pet or playing with them presents a minimal risk to individuals with illnesses. Nevertheless, he encourages hand washing after interactions with their pets and that they avoid zoos which can be harbors of many zoonotic diseases (Steele, 2008) .",

These factors can impact the patient's well-being and recovery. To mitigate this negative impact, some hospitals have developed interventions that might lessen patients' stress. These interventions include music, therapeutic touch, and visits by a therapy dog. As previously stated, there is anecdotal and scientific research that supports how a therapy dog can mitigate signs of stress such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. The therapy pet can be a distraction, a companion, have a calming influence, and may encourage patients to have pleasant thoughts. These researchers found that the intervention of the pet therapy program helped patients feel less pain, improved their mood and energy level, experience more calmness, and felt happier. Physiologically, however, their blood pressure and heart rate did not change when the intervention of the therapy pet occurred. Interestingly, the visit with the therapy dog lasted 10 min but still produced these results (Coakley & Mahoney, 2009 ).",

Depending on prior positive or negative experiences, the adolescence stage, such as early, late, or emerging adult, as well as the adolescent's preferred coping style determine how these experiences impact the adolescent (Black, 2009; Brown et al., 1996; Cassels et al., 2017; Coakley & Mahoney, 2009; Grilo et al., 1999; Luecken & Appelhans, 2005; Malone, 2016; Marsa-Sambola et al., 2017; Purewal et al., 2017; Shiloh et al., 2003) . Marsa-Sambola et al. (2017) indicate that communication between the adolescent and family members, best friends, and romantic partners have been shown to be important in the factors of self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and many other psychological experiences. The study conducted by Marsa-Sambola et al. (2017) focused on the influence of these communications between important people in the adolescent's life and how a pet attachment might influence the communications. Specifically, the study examined the influence of a pet attachment on adolescents' communication with significant others and the adolescents' perceptions of their quality of life. The study found that the adolescents' attachment to a dog partially mediates the effects of communication with significant others on quality of life, when the adolescent considered the dog or cat their own. Thus, the authors suggest that attachment to a dog or cat improve the psychological quality of the adolescent's life. Support during challenging adolescent experiences has been shown to be an important factor in how well the adolescent manages these situations (Cassels et al., 2017; Piper, 2014) . When family or friends fail to emotionally support an adolescent or are the perpetrator of their pain, the adolescent may turn to the unconditional love and acceptance they can receive from their pet, as the following quote from a past client (author LP) depicts quite nicely: I have long appreciated the love and acceptance of animals and have sought them out when suffering from bouts of depression. I had a pet dog for 18 years and she sensed when I was sick or depressed. She would look at me with her soulful eyes as if to say \"I understand\" and she would sit at/on my feet or curl up next to me on the couch and just \"be\" with me. Her warm body comforted me and the act of petting relaxed my anxiety.",

The author posits this higher score on loneliness scales by males may be due to a lack of close relationships. The author also suggests that the experience of loneliness impacts several areas of the adolescent's life, such as physical well-being, and social and emotional areas, yet the high school adolescent pet owner group was significantly less lonely compared to the adolescent non-pet owner group. Further, there was no difference in loneliness scores for cat or dog owners. Also, the adolescents' perceived bonding with their pets was negatively correlated with loneliness. Participants in the study descriptively described their relationship with their pets as a confidant, a family member, and a special friend (Black, 2009) .",

            "text": "According to Winerman (2017), programs in juvenile detention centers that require adolescents to spend several weeks training a rescue dog may have a positive impact, yet there has been little actual research conducted on the impact of these programs. These dog training programs focus on helping adolescents develop social skills, compassion, and empathy. Despite a lack of well-designed research studies, many teenagers how have gone through such programs often report significant benefits. Hanselman (2001) who researched the benefits of having an animal in a group for adolescents with anger management issues found that children and adolescents who have insecure attachment usually see themselves as unworthy, unlovable, and powerless; yet the presence of pets in an adolescent anger management group may increase feelings of \"happiness, security, and self-worth.\" Further, according to Cassels et al. (2017) and Hanselman (2001) , pets help facilitate attachment and attachment behaviors, as well as reducing feelings of stress isolation and loneliness in the adolescents. Many researchers have noted a positive impact of having a dog in a therapy session, either individual or group, on adolescents' behavior. Specifically, they can help adolescents engage in more positive behaviors, act out less, and become more cooperative (Chandler, 2012; Fine, 2010; Geist, 2011; Hanselman, 2001; Lange, Cox, Bernert, & Jenkins, 2006; Piper, 2014) .",

One such risk is related to physical health. This population, according to Rew and Horner (2003) , is particularly vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases and HIV. However, this population (Bender et al., 2007; Rew & Horner, 2003) has been shown to have strengths that assist them in their high-risk environment. Specifically, the homeless youths have resolve, self-efficacy, motivation, moral values, spirituality, pride, empathy, problem-solving ability, and a strong commitment to personal relationships. They also have self-confidence and are able to advocate for their physical well-being (Rew & Horner, 2003) . These homeless adolescents, according to Bender et al. (2007) , also demonstrate resourcefulness and self-improvement. They will turn to their peer community for support and guidance, especially when they are newcomers to homelessness. Further, these homeless youths will often have a canine companion who provides companionship, body heat when the weather is cold, and protection from would-be assailants, as well as the capacity to enjoy the human-animal bond (Bender et al., 2007; Rew & Horner, 2003) .",

It has been estimated that approximately 2 million adolescents experience homelessness in a year and one quarter of these children are chronically homeless (Bender et al., 2007; Rew, 2000; Thompson et al., 2006) . Priorities for these adolescents include the basic necessities of life-food, shelter, clothing, medical assistance, and mental health assistance. For many of these homeless, their companion pets, typically dogs, are considered their best friend and necessary to their survival. Many homeless youth have indicated that they do not think they would still be alive if it were not for their pets, that their pets help lessens loneliness, and compensate for a lack of human friendship (Bender et al., 2007; Berkoff, 2013; Rew, 2000; Thompson et al., 2006 ). Yet, this can be a problem since many shelters do not allow pets, and so frequently, these people choose to live on the streets rather than give up their pet. Irvine (2013) writes extensively on the importance of pets to homeless populations. Pets, while not often welcome in homeless shelters, serve as protectors, social connections, and sources of emotional support for people who are homeless. They often make choices to go without food or health care for themselves to care for their pets (Irvine, 2013; Thompson et al., 2006) . Some studies (Bender et al., 2007; Rew, 2000; Rew & Horner, 2003) , looking at factors of loneliness, companion animals, and coping among homeless youth. Situations that evoke feelings of loneliness include the death of their animal companion and a lonely lifestyle. Pet-owning homeless adolescents were less likely to report on measures of loneliness (Purewal et al., 2017) . Homeless youth identified two main strategies for coping with the loneliness, the first being with their friends and the second being with a companion dog. One factor that the homeless youth reported as a motivation for behaving responsibly was the need to take care of their companion dog (Bender et al., 2007; Rew, 2000; Rew & Horner, 2003) .",

The IAMS pet food company produced a series of commercials (\"A boy and his dog Duck\") evolving from a young boy and his new puppy running to and jumping into the car to the now grown boy and his aged dog needing encouragement to physically get into the car. This commercial exemplifies the longevity and closeness of relationships between children and their family pets. Yet another commercial, this one for the automobile company Subaru (\"Moving Out\"), shows a young boy packing up items from his room and placing them in the family car as his dog follows closely behind. As the commercial progresses, the young boy becomes an older teenager appearing to be leaving for college. He hugs his mom and dad and kneels down to pet his aging dog Moll-\"See you later Moll.\" This scenario plays out across the continent each fall as students head off to university, leaving their families that often includes the family pet.",

            "text": "\u2022 Establishing a volunteer program at a local shelter for students to complete service-related activities and get their \"critter-fix.\" \u2022 Creating a pet-therapy visiting team program. One example includes having specific teams visiting a specific dorm at the same time each week throughout the semester. This encourages the therapy team (dog and human) to establish relationships with the dorm residents. \u2022 Some universities have certified or registered therapy teams available through a library-type loan program. Students, and staff, can schedule a 30-min block of time to spend with the dog/team. \u2022 Many campuses bring dogs to campus as a stress relief activity near finals times. Consider expanding this type of program so that pets are available more regularly for students. \u2022 Develop a program at the campus counseling session. One idea is to advertise a dog day or dog hours at the center. Students who are in need of pet interaction can attend these sessions but it also takes into account that not all students are comfortable around dogs. Over 900 US colleges and universities have some form of pet therapy program on campus. This number is expected to grow as the beneficial aspects of human-animal interactions to college-aged students is further researched. As clinicians, including pet therapy programs in campus activities has the potential to provide client insights that may not be found otherwise. Appropriately established pet therapy programs can serve as a tremendous resource for students and staff that are facing challenging times. Whether reducing stress, serving as an indicator of anxiety, gathering groups of people together, or increasing mood, pets can have a positive impact on our college student population.",
