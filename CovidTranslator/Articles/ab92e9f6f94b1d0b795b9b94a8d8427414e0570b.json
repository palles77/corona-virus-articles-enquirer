Whether allogeneic NPCs are tolerated or induce immune-mediated rejection is controversial and poorly defined under neuroinflammatory demyelinating conditions. We have used the JHMV-induced demyelination model to evaluate the antigenicity of transplanted allogeneic NPCs within the central nervous system (CNS) of mice with established immunemediated demyelination. Cultured NPCs constitutively expressed the co-stimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 and IFN-\u03b3 treatment induced expression of MHC class I and II antigens. Injection of allogeneic C57BL/6 NPCs (H-2 b background) led to a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in Balb/c (H-2 d background) associated with T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 secretion following co-culture with allogeneic NPCs. Transplantation of MHC-mismatched NPCs into JHMV-infected mice resulted in increased transcripts encoding the T cell chemoattractant chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 that correlated with increased T cell infiltration that was associated with NPC rejection. Treatment of MHC-mismatched mice with T cell subset-specific depleting antibodies increased survival of allogeneic NPCs without affecting commitment to an oligodendroyte lineage. Collectively, these results show that allogeneic NPCs are antigenic and T cells contribute to rejection following transplantation into an inflamed CNS suggesting that immunomodulatory treatments may be necessary to prolong survival of allogeneic cells.",

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neurological disability in young adults 1 . The etiology of MS is thought to be multi-factorial including genetic, and environmental factors that may lead to initiation, maintenance and/or progression of disease 2 . For example, viral infection has long been considered a potential triggering mechanism involved in demyelination and numerous human viral pathogens have been suggested to be involved in eliciting myelin-reactive lymphocytes and/or antibodies that subsequently infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) and damage the myelin sheath [3] [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, viral models of demyelination are clearly relevant and have provided important insight into mechanisms associated with disease initiation, neuroinflammation, demyelination, and remyelination. An important clinical aspect related to the pathogenesis of MS is the eventual remyelination failure in chronic demyelinated plaques by endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) [7] [8] [9] . With this in mind, cell-based therapies using neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have emerged as a potentially viable approach for promoting remyelination 10, 11 . Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that transplantation of syngeneic mouse NPCs into mice persistently infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) is well tolerated and is associated with axonal sparing accompanied by extensive remyelination while not significantly dampening either neuroinflammation or T cell responses 12, 13 . Evident from this work is the ability of engrafted NPCs to i) migrate to and colonize regions of demyelination by responding to the chemokine ligand CXCL12 14 ii) preferentially differentiate into cells of an oligodendrocyte linage 14, 15 , and iii) promote axonal sparing and remyelination 15 .",

            "text": "NPC transplantation offers a promising therapeutic approach for promoting remyelination in patients with demyelinating disease such as MS. However, similar to solid-organ transplantation, donor specific allogeneic responses are likely to occur that may require lifelong immunosuppression that elevates susceptibility to opportunistic infections and tumors. Therefore, an important and clinically relevant question related to stem cell therapies revolves around the allograft rejection of implanted allogeneic stem cells as they may not be \"self-derived.\" This is particularly important when considering cellular transplantation for treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases as ongoing debate has centered on whether MHC matching is critical for successful engraftment into the CNS. Compelling evidence argues that unmatched grafts are well-tolerated within the CNS due to muted immunogenicity of NPCs and clinical studies supporting that transplantation of allogeneic NPCs results in prolonged survival [16] [17] [18] . However, the immunoprivileged status of NPCs has recently been questioned 19 and more recent studies argue that MHC mismatching diminishes survival of NPCs and mutes endogenous neurogenesis, and this is associated with innate immune responses 20 . Moreover, transplantation of allogeneic NPCs in a model of spinal cord injury results in activation of the immune system and NPC rejection 21 . These findings indicate that in order for long-term engraftment of NPCs to be efficacious the use of immunomodulatory agents must be considered. With this in mind, it is imperative to determine if allogeneic NPCs are antigenic following transplantation into an environment with established inflammatory demyelinating disease. To this end, we provide evidence that allogeneic NPCs are recognized as foreign and infiltrating lymphocytes contribute to rejection following transplantation into JHMV-infected mice with established demyelination.",

Expression of both MHC class I and II antigens increased over time as determined by staining at 18, 24, and 42 hours post-treatment when compared to medium only-treated cultures ( Figure 1 ). Medium only-treated GFP-NPCs expressed <1% MHC class I and II. The kinetics of expression in response to IFN-\u03b3 treatment were different between the two surface antigens with 89.9\u00b10.7% of cells (Figures 1A and B) . These data demonstrate that while cultured NPCs are capable of expressing both MHC class I and II, expression of MHC class I is markedly more rapid and robust when compared to MHC class II. Examination of CD80 and CD86 expression revealed that cultured NPCs constitutively expressed costimulatory molecules and exposure to IFN-\u03b3 did not augment expression of either of these molecules ( Figures 1C and D) . We next evaluated whether allogeneic NPCs could evoke a T cell-mediated response. Balb/c mice (H-2 d background) were immunized with splenocytes derived from C57BL/6 mice (H-2 b background) and challenged via footpad injection (8 days post-immunization, p.i.) with either NPCs or splenocytes derived from either C57BL/6 mice or Balb/c mice. Within 24 h post-challenge, immunized Balb/c mice exposed to MHCmismatched NPCs or splenocytes displayed increased footpad swelling with splenocyte challenged mice displaying greater swelling (0.36\u00b10.12mm, p<0.01, n=3) as compared to NPC challenged mice (0.18\u00b10.04mm, p<0.05, n=3). By 48 h, swelling had decreased in splenocyte-challenged mice yet increased in NPC-challenged animals (0.31\u00b10.02mm, p<0.01), indicating that although the memory response following splenocyte immunization was stronger against splenocytes than NPCs, NPCs were capable of inducing a memory T cell response ( Figure 1E ).",

Enriched T cell subsets were co-cultured with antigen presenting cells (APCs) from uninfected C57BL/6 mice pulsed with viral peptides corresponding to the CD4 specific epitope within the membrane (M) glycoprotein spanning amino acid residues 133-147 (M133-147) or CD8 specific epitope within the spike (S) glycoprotein spanning amino acid residues 510-518 (S510-518) in order to stimulate virus-specific T cells. After 48 h, media was collected and cultured GFP-NPCs were treated for defined periods of time and expression of MHC class I and II measured by flow cytometry. Similar to IFN-\u03b3 treatment, CM from antigen sensitized CD4 and CD8 T cells induced MHC class I expression on cultured GFP-NPCs at 18, 24, and 42 h (Figures 2A and B ). In addition, there was a significant increase in the frequency of MHC class II-positive NPCs following treatment with CM from viral peptide stimulated populations of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells relative to IFN-\u03b3 treatment (Figures 2A and B) . While MHC class I expression was not appreciably increased on GFP-NPCs following incubation with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell conditioned media relative to IFN-\u03b3, MFI analysis determined that the level of MHC class I expression per cell was increased approximately 2-fold compared to IFN-\u03b3 treatment, although this diminishes after prolonged exposure to IFN-\u03b3 ( Figures 2C and D) . Conversely, while MHC class II was expressed a greater frequency of GFP-NPCs following incubation with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell CM, the amount of MHC class II per cell was not appreciably increased. Although the MFI of MHC class II increased at the later time points relative to IFN-\u03b3 this was likely due to increased number of cells expressing MHC class II, as shown by the histogram in Figure 2C . These data demonstrate that antigen sensitized CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are capable of inducing MHC class I and MHC II expression on NPCs and the overall increased expression represents the presence of additional proinflammatory cytokines working synergistically with IFN-\u03b3 being secreted from virus-specific T cells.",

Syngeneic transplant of GFP-NPCs into infected C57BL/6 mice resulted in extensive migration along the spinal cord both rostral and caudal to implantation site and preferentially colonized within areas of white matter damage ( Figure 3A) . Conversely, allogeneic GFP-NPCs, transplanted into JHMV-infected Balb/c mice, were detected at day 8 p.t. but not at day 21 p.t. (Figure 3B ). Quantification of transplanted cells, as determined by counting GFPpositive cells in defined areas rostral and caudal to the implantation site, revealed a significant difference in the number of GFP-NPCs present in the spinal cords of syngeneic transplanted mice compared to allogeneic transplanted mice at day 21 p.t. (Figure 3C ). Further, determination of GFP expression by mRNA by quantitative PCR revealed a >180fold decrease in signal intensity in allogeneic transplant at day 21 p.t. relative to day 1 p.t. as compared to syngeneic recipients in which there was an ~9-fold increase (p\u22640.001) in GFP transcript levels at day 21 p.t. relative to day 1 p.t., consistent with earlier findings that engrafted cells proliferate ( Figure 3D) 14 .",

To ensure T cells proliferation was not caused by potential contamination of APCs during the isolation, T cells were enriched from the spleens of recipient mice and subsequently sorted by FACS to isolate specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations (>99% purity, Figure 5A ). Co-cultures of T cell subsets from mice at day 21 p.t. mice showed increased CD4+ T cell proliferation in response to exposure to either MHC-mismatched splenocytes as well as NPCs treated in medium alone or IFN-\u03b3 as compared to CD4+ T cells from na\u00efve non-transplanted Balb/c mice ( Figure 5B) . Notably, IFN-\u03b3 treatment did not significantly alter T cell proliferative response. Although CD8+ T cells exhibited a similar response to MHC-mismatched splenocytes as CD4+ T cells, there was a comparatively muted response to NPCs ( Figure 5B ). Further, ELISPOT analysis revealed increased (p<0.05) numbers of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells following co-culture with either C57BL/6 splenocytes or NPCs used as stimulators compared to T cells obtained from naive nontransplanted mice ( Figure 5C ). We next tested whether there was an antigen-recall response to transplanted allogeneic NPCs in vivo by measuring a DTH response. Naive nontransplanted Balb/c mice or GFP-NPC-transplanted Balb/c mice received a footpad injection of GFP-NPCs at day 21 p.t. The majority of injected GFP-NPC transplanted mice (75%; 6 out of 8) exhibited increased footpad swelling relative to naive non-transplanted controls by 24 h post footpad injection, and this increased to ~90% of mice responding by 48 h following injection. At 24 h, the footpad swelling in mice that received intraspinal NPCs (0.42\u00b10.12mm) was significantly (p<0.01) greater than swelling in naive non-transplanted control mice (0.18\u00b10.10mm, Figure 5D ). As controls, na\u00efve Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice received a subcutaneous injection of GFP-NPCs and 8 days later challenged with GFP-NPCs and footpad swelling measured at days 1, 2, and 4 post-injection. Challenge of Balb/c mice injected with allogeneic GFP-NPCs resulted in a significant (p<0.05) increase in footpad swelling at days 2 and 4 post-challenge compared to syngeneic confirming that GFP-NPCs were antigenic within the context of allogeneic injection whereas syngeneic injection elicits no immune response (data not shown).",

Treatment with antibodies specific for either T cell subset resulted in >98% depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the periphery ( Figure 6A, top panel) . However, within the spinal cord, antibody treatment only resulted in ~45% reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell levels ( Figure  6A, bottom panel) . This most likely reflects limited penetration of monoclonal antibodies into the CNS and/or muted efficacy in depleting T cells within the CNS. Nonetheless, T cell depletion resulted in a significant increase in numbers of allogeneic NPCs when compared to allogeneic recipients treated with control antibody ( Figure 6C ). Depletion of CD4+ T cells had the greatest effect on allogeneic NPC survival when compared to animals treated with anti-CD8+ T cells ( Figure 6C ). In recipients of allogeneic NPCs treated with anti-CD4, surviving NPCs accumulated within white matter tracts in which demyelinating lesions are present whereas anti-CD8 treatment restricted migration of cells which retained primarily the dorsal funiculus ( Figure 6B ). These observations implicate T cells as important in contributing to rejection of allogeneic NPCs. Finally, surviving allogeneic GFP-NPCs from transplanted mice treated with either anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 were capable of differentiating into PDGFR\u03b1+ oligodendrocytes, similar GFP-NPCs in a syngeneic transplant without treatment. This demonstrates that the differentiation fate of allogeneically transplanted NPCs are not affected by the antibody treatment ( Figure 6D ).",

            "text": "The use of neural stem/progenitor cells for treatment of human neurologic diseases is recognized as a clinically viable approach for reducing disease severity and promoting recovery. Indeed, human neural stem cells (NSCs) are currently approved for use in clinical trials for improving function in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder in children as well as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD), a fatal myelination disorder (www.stemcellsinc.com). Additionally, use of NPCs has been shown to restore cognition following transplantation into the CNS of mice with neuropathological conditions similar to those observed in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 38 and ameliorates radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction in rats 39, 40 . NPCs are attractive to use for treating a broad array of human neurologic disease conditions based on evidence that NPCs are capable of differentiating into distinct glial lineages and neurons as well as promoting neurogenesis 15, [41] [42] [43] . Further, ongoing clinical trials and experimental models of neurologic disease indicate there is no evidence of tumor or non-neural tissue formation that further strengthens the relevance of using these cells for disease treatment [44] [45] [46] . Therefore, the potential for using NPCs for restoring functional and behavioral deficits arising from loss or damage of host CNS cells holds great promise and clinical interest. A potentially critical aspect in better understanding the biology of NPC transplantation relates to the antigenicity of these cells as well as their ability to modulate the host's immune response. Highlighting the importance of this area of research are conflicting reports indicating that NPCs are immunologically inert and well-tolerated following transplantation into MHC-mismatched animals 16 while other reports demonstrate that both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are activated and participate in killing allogeneic NPCs 20,21 .",

Based upon this body of work, it is clear that transplanted cells were critical in contributing to the improved histopathological outcome 14, 47 . Therefore, understanding whether allogeneic NPCs survive following transplantation into JHMVinfected mice is important with regards to improved clinical and histologic outcome within the context of this model but also with regards to other models in which NPC transplantation has been shown to be beneficial. Our findings clearly demonstrate that MHC mistmatched NPCs are not immunopriviledged but rather antigenic following transplantation into JHMVinfected mice with established neuroinflammatory-mediated demyelination. Evidence is provided that supports an important role for T cells in contributing to rejection as i) NPCs evoke a DTH response following footpad injection into transplanted mice, ii) co-culture of NPCs with T cells isolated from transplanted mice results in T cell proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 secretion, and iii) depletion of T cell subsets increases survival of allogeneic NPCs.",

Similarly, we show that cultured NPCs do not constitutively express either MHC I and II but detectable levels are present only in response to treatment with IFN-\u03b3. Further, exposure of cultured NPCs with CM obtained following stimulation of virus-specific T cells not only increased the overall frequency of both MHC class I and II on NPCs but also enhanced expression on a per cell basis. These findings reflect that NPCs are sensitive to inflammatory cytokines that subsequently increase surface expression of MHC antigens.. Lack of constitutive MHC expression on NPCs is consistent with other studies reporting that both embryonic stem cells (mouse and human) and induced pluripotent stem cells do not express MHC antigens 49, 50 . Muted expression of MHC antigens on stem/progenitor cells has been suggested as one potential mechanism contributing to prolonged survival following transplantation into an MHC incompatible host as it would limit recognition by inflammatory T cells. We also report that co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 are constitutively expressed on NPCs and expression is not modulated following exposure to IFN-\u03b3 in-vitro. This is in contrast to previous reports that show that although mouse NPCs express CD80 and CD86, these costimulatory molecules are upregulated following IFN-\u03b3 treatment or under pathological conditions 51, 52 . Collectively, these findings highlight that the environmental inflammatory cytokine milieu may be critical with regards to influencing expression of surface antigens on allogeneic NPCs that allow for detection by activated immune cells.",

Consistent with this possibility is our data demonstrating that allogeneic NPCs are quickly rejected following transplantation into spinal cords of JHMV-demyelinated spinal cord, an environment where activated T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 are readily present.

Further, treatment with anti-CD4+ T cell subset depleting antibodies resulted in enhanced survival of allogeneic NPCs when compared to animals treated with anti-CD8+ T cell subset antibodies. These data support a recent report demonstrating a more important role for CD4+ T cells in immune-mediated rejection of hESC xenografts 50 . Nevertheless, T cells are clearly sensitized to allogeneic NPCs following injection into MHC mismatched JHMV-infected mice as demonstrated by increased proliferation, detectable DTH responses, and IFN-\u03b3 secretion by T cells. It is important to emphasize that administration of T cell specific depleting antibodies did not completely eliminate T cells within the CNS although these cells were efficiently depleted from the periphery.",

Therefore, increased expression of MHC antigens on transplanted allogeneic NPCs would represent a potential target for activated T cells present within the spinal cords of persistently-infected mice. In addition, indirect recognition (e.g. phagocytic engulfment of dead/dying NPCs) and subsequent presentation of antigens represents an additional scenario by which T cells become sensitized to alloantigens. This is not an unreasonable scenario as many NPCs will die during injection into the spinal cord and these cells are presumably removed by activated inflammatory macrophages that could then migrate to secondary lymphatic tissue and present novel antigens to na\u00efve lymphocytes. Alternatively, alloantigens could be shed following transplantation and presented by local APCs following phagocytic uptake. At this time, we have not distinguished whether direct and/or indirect recognition of NPC antigens is occurring in response to NPC transplantation into JHMVinfected mice. However, indirect recognition may favor a more important role for CD4+ T cells in contributing to rejection and this is consistent with our findings. Interestingly, we also demonstrate NPCs that survive following depletion of T cell subsets exhibit normal differentiation into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) similar to syngeneic NPC recipients. These findings argue that the local microenvironmental niche remains capable of providing necessary growth factors required for fate commitment to the oligodendroglia lineage.",

For example, NK cells have been shown to be involved in numerous models of allograft rejection including bone marrow, skin, and cornea allografts [53] [54] [55] . The observed result that not every allogeneic NPC transplanted mouse yielded DTH swelling or IFN-\u03b3 production in response to allogeneic NPC or splenocyte stimulators could be due to NK cell-mediated rejection, thus limiting memory T cell formation. As recently illustrated by Palmer and colleagues 20 , transplantation of allogeneic NPCs into the hippocampus of normal mice resulted in a dramatic reduction in survival and this was the result of innate immune responses directed to transplanted cells. Induction of immune suppression through treatment with cyclosporine A did not increase allogeneic NPC survival yet treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs protected NPCs from destruction 20 . These findings clearly illustrate the importance of innate immune responses in participating in allograft destruction and further highlight the importance of the local microenvironment in allogeneic NPC transplantation as the lingering effects of inflammation at the transplant site are likely to result in killing of allografts through both innate and adaptive immune responses.",
