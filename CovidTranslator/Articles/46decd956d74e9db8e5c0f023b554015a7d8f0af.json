An emerging theme in coronavirus pathogenesis is that the interaction between specific viral genes and the host immune system, specifically the innate immune system, functions as a key determinant in regulating virulence and disease outcomes. Using SARS-CoV as a model, we will review the current knowledge of the interplay between coronavirus infection and the host innate immune system in vivo, and then discuss the mechanisms by which specific gene products antagonize the host innate immune response in cell culture models. Our data suggests that the SARS-CoV uses specific strategies to evade and antagonize the sensing and signaling arms of the interferon pathway. We summarize by identifying future points of consideration that will contribute greatly to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing coronavirus pathogenesis and virulence, and the development of severe disease in humans and animals.",

Early control of viral replication by type I Interferons (IFN), complement proteins, and other innate immune mediators limit viral spread within the host during the early phases of the disease (Katze et al., 2002) . The early innate response also plays an important role in shaping the downstream adaptive immune response, however an overactive innate immune response can also result in immune pathology and subsequent tissue damage (reviewed in (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006) ). Within the last decade, it is clear that many viruses encode specific gene products that antagonize both the innate and acquired arms of the immune response (Andrejeva et al., 2004; Basler et al., 2000; Cruz et al., 2006; Gale et al., 1997; Meylan et al., 2005; Parisien et al., 2001; Park et al., 2003; Symons et al., 1995; Xiang et al., 2002; Ye et al., 2007) . Therefore, a detailed knowledge of how specific viruses interact with the host innate immune system is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating virulence, pathogenesis and disease outcomes.",

Although early studies indicated that mutations in the M glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) modulated type I IFN responses, suggesting that coronaviruses may encode a novel set of gene functions that interface with the host innate immune response, little effort focused on unraveling the details of coronavirus innate immune interactions (Charley and Laude, 1988; La Bonnardiere and Laude, 1983) . Early experiments showed that variants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are differentially susceptible to IFN. This may contribute to different pathogenic outcomes, however little additional experimentation was performed (Taguchi and Siddell, 1985) . However, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic of 2003 rekindled a high level of interest in how coronaviruses interact with the host and whether interactions with the host innate immune system are important in both the control of viral infection or if these interactions lead to virus-induced disease.",

Though less robust than pDCs, mDCs can also secrete large amounts of type I IFN (Laiosa et al., 2006) . However, mDCs also play a major role in stimulating acquired immune responses through their capacity as antigen presenting cells and producers of a wide array of immunomodulatory cytokines (Laiosa et al., 2006) . MPs are potent producers of type I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce antiviral protection while also potentially contributing to immune pathology associated with viral infections (Diamond et al., 2003) . Analysis of the impact of DCs and MPs on SARS-CoV infection will be discussed below.",

            "text": "Since its discovery 50 years ago by Isaacs and Lindemann, the IFN system has come to be recognized as a crucial frontline defense against viral infection (Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957) . IFNs mediate direct antiviral effects that limit viral replication by activating/upregulating several well defined antiviral effectors, including PKR and RNaseL, while also modulating other aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses through the induction of a wide array of IFN inducible genes (ISGs) (Stark et al., 1998; Takaoka and Yanai, 2006) . The number pathogens that neutralize IFN, or other key components of the IFN system, illustrate that this system is essential for the control of a diverse array of viruses and bacteria. Perhaps the clearest indicator of how important this pathway is to antiviral defense is the sheer number of IFN avoidance/antagonism strategies that viruses have evolved. These viral IFN evasion strategies can be roughly segregated into three categories: 1) avoidance, where the virus shields itself or its byproducts from recognition by the host cell sensors that activate the IFN system (Cardenas et al., 2006) , 2) suppression of IFN induction, where the virus actively inhibits the host cell sensor machinery or its downstream signaling molecules to prevent the initiation of IFN transcription (Cardenas et al., 2006; Hiscott et al., 2006a; Hiscott et al., 2006b; Lin et al., 2006; Li et al., 2005b; Li et al., 2005a; Meylan et al., 2005) , or 3) suppression of IFN signaling, where viral gene products block signaling events at or downstream of the type I IFN receptor complex to prevent activation of an antiviral state within the infected cell or the enhancement of the IFN response by activating late type I IFN genes (Parisien et al., 2001; Rodriguez et al., 2002) . This raises the question of how coronaviruses, which include human (SARS-CoV, NL63, OC43 and 229E) and animal (MHV, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV, TGEV, etc.) strains, interact with the type I IFN system. Of these viruses, only 229E has been shown to induce IFN in infected cells in culture, while viruses such as SARS-CoV and MHV fail to induce type I IFN responses in cell culture. However, the mechanism for how Coronaviruses evade the innate immune system is largely unexplored.",

Toll like receptors (TLRs), which include TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9, can detect viruses in endosomal compartments as they enter cells, while cytoplasmic CARD domain containing RNA helicases, RIG-I and Mda5, sense viral RNA in the cytoplasm. Both pathways are based on sensor interactions with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as double stranded RNA which is a byproduct of viral replication, or structured single stranded RNAs associated with incoming viral genomes, being common targets. The TLR and cytoplasmic IFN induction pathways do utilize different adaptor proteins to mediate signaling, with the TLR dependent pathways utilizing TRIF and/or MyD88, and the cytoplasmic induction pathway utilizing the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS/ IPS-1/VISA/CARDIF. (Figure 1 ) Downstream of the differing adapters, both pathways share many common signaling molecules and transcription factors, with both pathways ultimately activating IRF-3, NF-kB, and AP-1 to initiate type I IFN gene transcription. Each of these pathways will be discussed further with respect to its potential role in coronavirus infection.",

Reghunathan et al. found that IP-10 was induced in SARS-CoV infected patients and there was a correlation between high IP-10 levels and poor patient outcome (Reghunathan et al., 2005) . The authors also found that IL-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were highly induced in super-infected patients, with high levels indicative of a high risk of death. Additionally, microarray-based analysis of RNA derived from PBMCs from 10 SARS-CoV infected patients demonstrated that the cells were highly activated and expressing high levels of inflammatory cytokines. However, no IFN\u03b1 or \u03b2 induction was detected in these patients. Though these studies provide valuable information on the kinetics and type of host cytokine response that occurs in infected humans during SARS-CoV infection, drawing general conclusions from these studies is difficult due to differences in both the timing of study, the patient population analyzed, and the types of assays used to evaluate cytokine responses.",

            "text": "Several experiments were performed on lung tissue from fatal SARS cases. Most reports used only a single or a few patients with different times of death, whether it was from acute disease or a secondary infection, trying to compare their study to a control patient. Chen et al. identified carbon containing MPs while To et al. found only infection of epithelial cells by in situ and immunofluorescence . Another publication by Chow et al. identifies lung pneumocytes, but not MPs as the site of virus replication, while yet another identifies a different lymphocyte population as the main replication target (Chow et al., 2004) . Each of these differs in the type and length of time of infection of tissues used, the fixation technique for tissue preservation, the type of probe and the technique used to identify viral proteins and RNA. A recent paper by Nicholls et al. attempts to combine a large set of patient samples using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR to build a comprehensive picture of the infection cycle (Nicholls et al., 2006) . They also comment on how false positive or negatives can arise for several reasons, including: 1) not all lung tissue is homogenous, so using tissue from one part of the lung versus another can critically change your interpretation, 2) different probes and techniques have varying levels of sensitivity depending on the age of the tissue and how it was handled, 3) the age of the individual will alter the immune response and clearance time of infection, 4) the overall immune status of the individual at the time of infection (immunocompromised versus healthy) would impact on both the overall levels of viral replication and the subsequent host inflammatory response to the virus, and 5) the timeframe from initial symptoms to death may differ significantly between individuals, with individuals that rapidly progress showing higher levels of virus at the time of death, while individuals that succumb to infection after an extended period may have little virus present and die due to secondary causes. Based on their analysis of this large set of patient samples, Nicholls et al., concluded that alveolar epithelium and MPs are the primary targets of SARS-CoV in the lung. They also suggest that pneumocytes may be the initial site of infection, but that MPs take up virions and disseminate the virus within the lungs. Interestingly, in the 25 patients they tested that died within two weeks of symptoms, no virus was detected by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry, even in tissues with clear damage. This suggests that viral replication may not be directly responsible for death in these individuals, raising the possibility that virusinduced immune pathology may contribute to SARS-CoV induced disease. In fact, since high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines correlate with poor SARS-CoV outcome (Reghunathan et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2004) , it is possible that SARS-CoV infection of MPs or other potent producers of pro-inflammatory cytokines, without high levels of viral replication, may ultimately lead to virus-induced immune pathology within the lungs of patients with poor disease outcomes.",

            "text": "Given their role in maintaining homeostasis within the lungs, as well as their ability to mount robust innate immune responses, it is important to consider the role of MPs and DCs during SARS-CoV infection. Several conflicting reports of SARS-CoV replication and IFN induction in MPs and DCs have been published over the last few years. Early reports showed that SARS-CoV did not replicate efficiently in purified monocytes and MPs (Yilla et al., 2005) . The infection however was donor dependent, with 100% infection in some donors and less than 5% infection efficiency in others. This study also showed that there was a correlation between the donor cells that produced high amounts of IFN\u03b1 in response to SARS-CoV also being less permissive for productive infection. However, this is not the case for all their donors, with some producing high levels of IFN and being infected while other produce low levels of IFN and were not infected. Castilletti et al. also found IF\u03b1 and \u03b3 induced from PBMCs infected with SARS-CoV, with the most robust responses occurring when the PBMCs were exposed to fixed SARS-CoV infected Vero cells (Castilletti et al., 2005) . These results suggest that PBMCs are poorly permissive for SARS-CoV and the authors propose that PBMCs may be able to detect viral glycoproteins on the surface of cells and that this may be a mechanism for the apparent immunopathology seen in SARS patients lungs. Results from Spiegel et al., also demonstrated that both live and U.V. inactivated SARS-CoV could induce type I IFN responses and cellular maturation in DC cultures , suggesting that productive viral replication is not required to active anti-viral and/or pro-inflammatory responses in these cells.",

By electron microscopy virions are seen inside both immature and mature DCs and small amounts of negative strand RNA were detectable in those cells, suggesting that some level of viral gene expression was occurring. However the level of RNA decreased over the course of several days indicating that there was no productive replication. These studies found no evidence of apoptosis or antiviral cytokines such as IFN \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and IL-12; however, they did find significant up-regulation of IP-10, MIP1\u03b1, Rantes and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1).

The effect of viral infection on the induction of antiviral type I IFN responses in these cell types is less clear cut, since type I IFN induction has been observed by some groups and not others. This difference may reflect sensitivity differences in their assays, the cell types that are being evaluated, or even genetic differences in their donor cohorts.

(Figure 2 ) During this time frame, Sendai Virus (SeV) infected cells induced large amounts of IFN\u03b2 promoter activity. We also tested whether MA104 cells, African green monkey kidney cells that have an intact IFN system secrete IFN when infected with SARS-CoV. We find no Type I IFN to be secreted from either Urbani infected or Tor2 infected cells.

Microarray analysis was performed on cells at a single 24 hr time point post infection. They find no change in IFN\u03b1 and \u03b2 but an up-regulation of CXC chemokines, OAS2 and MX. Interestingly there was no difference in the double stranded RNA activated protein kinase (PKR). IL-18 and MP migration inhibitory factor (MIF) are down regulated. They extend this correlation to data seen in some patient samples where they find an up-regulation of IP-10 and IL-8. Spiegel et al also used Caco2 as well as 293 cells to characterize the innate immune response to SARS infection, comparing the effects of virus on permissive (Caco2) and less permissive cells (293T cells) . Although SARS-CoV infection did not induce IFNs, antiviral genes or IL-6; IP-10 and IL-8 were induced in the permissive Caco2 cells, but not 293 cells. They conclude that early virus growth is probably able to expand rapidly while suppressing anti-viral genes but still secreting IP-10 and IL-8 to recruit immune cells.",

They also reported significant inductions of IL-8, IL-6, SOCS3 and TLRs 4,7 and 9 transcripts. The discrepancy between these different studies might reflect differences in timing, assay sensitivity, or even different passage histories of the cell types in question. However, with the exception of the results from Okabayashi, most reports argue that SARS-CoV is a poor inducer of type I IFN in productively infected cells. We cannot reproduce the results reported by Okabayashi et al., as SARS-CoV infection in Caco2 and 293 cells did not induce expression of IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, NFkB or p56 (Figure 4 ). However in infected cultures, we also reproduce the noted induction of IP-10 in both cell lines supporting reports by Speigel et al. At this time, the preponderance of data argue that SARS-CoV infection does not induce Type I IFNs following productive infection in cell culture.",

            "text": "During the coronavirus life cycle (Figure 6 ), there are several steps where cellular proteins could detect viral components (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . Coronavirus entry is thought to be a three stage process including binding of S glycoprotein to the Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE2) protein, cleavage by cathepsin L and activation of a fusion peptide in S2 that mediates entry via fusion through endocytic compartments (Simmons et al., 2005) . Fusion, which for SARS happens in an endosomal type structure after cathepsin L cleaves the viral S glycoprotein, viral RNA, which is tightly bound by the N, is released into the cytoplasm of the cell. Following viral genome release into the cytosol, the genome is translated into the viral replicase proteins ORF1a and 1b. These polyproteins are then cleaved by 2 proteases, a Papain like protease (PLP) and the Main Protease (Mpro), into the individual proteins necessary for replication. The incoming genomic RNA then serves as a template for the synthesis of full length and subgenomic length negative strand RNAs that serves as template for mRNA synthesis. Subgenomic RNA synthesis occurs from discontinuous transcription that joins leader RNA sequences encoded at the 5\u2032 end of the genome to the body sequences of each subgenomic RNA. The model of transcription attenuation argues that the replicase binds to the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA, transcribes incomplete negative strands that terminate in highly conserved transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) defined by the sequence ACGAAC, dissociates and re-associates with the full length template near the 5\u2032 end of the genome to prime transcription of subgenomic negative strand RNAs containing anti-leader RNA sequences. The eight different subgenomic negative strands serve as template for the synthesis of like sized subgenomic mRNA (Brian and Baric, 2005) . Replicase, structural and accessory proteins are produced during this phase of replication at which time the structural proteins M and E localize to the Golgi Apparatus and transverse to a ER/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) where budding occurs. Also during this phase, accessory proteins are produced that localize throughout the cell.",

Endosome associated TLRs, such as TLR3 or TLR7 may detect SARS-CoV genomic RNA during entry; alternatively the cytoplasmic RNA sensors, RIG-I and Mda5 might detect the RNA as it enters into the cytoplasm. However, a specific role for TLRs or RIG-I/Mda5 in detecting coronaviruses has not been reported, yet several virus families encode products that antagonize signaling at this level (Kash et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2005) . Coronaviruses may also encode proteins which block the viral RNA signaling and sensing pathways. Although specific mechanisms have not been elucidated, it is possible that the viral genome is sequestered, perhaps by the viral N protein, in such a way that the viral RNA is shielded from host sensor proteins. Other viral proteins, such as NS1 of influenza and VP35 of Ebola virus have been shown to block type I IFN induction by interfering with the ability of host sensor proteins (IRF3, Stat1, RigI, MDA5) to detect incoming virus (Hartman et al., 2004; Kash et al., 2006) . For many coronaviruses, there is no known mechanism of how they evade the host innate immune system. It is hypothesized that it is by either 1) actively producing IFN antagonist proteins, 2) using their own replicase proteins to modify host proteins or by 3) the formation of double membrane vesicles and compartmentalizing replication and perhaps other coronavirus RNAs. The use of double membrane vesicles could hide the RNAs produced by protecting them from the RNA sensing machinery. There may also be a role for N in shielding the viral RNAs from the dsRNA and ssRNA sensing pathways. Many of these possibilities are being actively investigated.",

Zhou et al. demonstrated that although MHV does not induce nuclear translocation of IRF3 or IFN\u03b2 gene induction it does not block these pathways either (Zhou and Perlman, 2007) . Subsequent treatment of cells with poly I:C or Sendai virus post infection allows for proper nuclear import of IRF3 and induction of IFN\u03b2 mRNA. They also show that RIGI, MDA5 and TLR3 are also not inhibited by MHV infection. Similar results were shown by Versteed et al. for MHV and SARS-CoV (Versteeg et al., 2007) . They also show that MHV does not induce IRF3 nuclear translocation and IFN\u03b1 gene induction but that each of these is activated when cells are treated with poly I:C or Sendai Virus. In addition they show that SARS acts the same way in culture; it does not induce the IFN sensing pathway but does not block the pathways either. Each hypothesizes that there may protection via compartmentalization of the replication complexes and replication RNA in the cell that protects it from being sensed by the anti-viral machinery. Versteeg et al. also proposes that since the 5\u2032 end of SARS RNA is capped it is protected from recognition by RIGI since it was recently shown that RIGI specifically binds to free phosphates at the 5\u2032 end of the RNA (Hornung et al., 2006; Pichlmair et al., 2006 ). This may be another level of protection SARS-CoV uses to block its sensing from the cellular anti-viral machinery.",

We find that SARS infection does not induce IFN\u03b2 or NFkB gene induction, however, they do not block those pathways either (Figure 7a and b) . Promoters of IFN\u03b2 and NFkB were assayed for their ability to drive luciferase expression after infection by SARS. Wildtype SARS infection of cells does activate the induction of the either of the promoters however each could be activated post infection by polyI:C (data not shown), exogenous IFN\u03b2 (data not shown) or Sendai Virus (Figure 7a and b) similar to Zhou et al. and Versteed et al. We created recombinant SARS viruses deleted for each of the SARS accessory ORFs; ORF3a, 3b, 3ab, 3ab/6, 6, 7a, 7b, 8b and 9b. We hypothesized a SARS-CoV accessory ORF may be mediating the IFN sensing block in vivo. However we find that similar to wildtype SARS-CoV, all the deletions fail to induce any of the promoters analyzed above. All of the deletions also allowed for induction post infection by Sendai virus and poly I:C of the IFN\u03b2, NFkB and p56 promoters assayed. Our data combined with Zhou et al. and Versteeg et al. lead us to hypothesize that there is a mechanism by which MHV and SARS-CoV evade detection of by innate immune system by 1) sequestering the viral genome on membranous replication complexes, 2) capping viral RNA to evade detection by one arm of the dsRNA sensing machinery and 3) potentially actively inhibiting the innate immune system by the function of virally encoded proteins. One caveat to this work is that SARS-CoV could be inhibiting IFN signaling pathways that are detrimental to its own replication and survival but not inhibiting different pathways inducible by SeV and poly I:C.",

When expressed in 293 cells from a plasmid, each viral ORF not only blocked expression from an IFN\u03b2 and IRF3 promoter reporter plasmid but also blocked IRF3 phosphorylation. N expression blocked NFkB promoter induction while ORF3b and 6 did not, demonstrating an interesting difference in their IFN blocking mechanism. One other distinction between the 3 genes is that all 3 blocked expression from an ISRE promoter reporter construct when the cells were stimulated with Sendai Virus, but only 3b and 6 blocked induction of the ISRE reporter when the cells were treated with IFN\u03b2. Shown in figure 8a, ORF6 expressed in 293 cells blocked induction of an ISRE promoter expressing luciferase in response to IFN\u03b2 treatment. These data suggested a direct block of the IFN amplification side of the innate immune pathway; from the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor to STAT1 nuclear translocation to induction of STAT1 transcribed genes (assayed by the ISRE promoter construct). ORF6 expression does not effect STAT1 phosphorylation but ORF6 blocked nuclear localization of Stat1 after the cells were treated with IFN\u03b2 (Figure 8b and c) This data shows that each of the 3 genes blocks IFN sensing and signaling in a different way, enabling a reduction in the anti-viral induction pathways from several different pathways.",

They also show that SARS-CoV reacts similarly as MHV to different types of DCs (cDC vs. pDC). They identify a potential mediator of the IFN induction as well. They find that TLR7 seems to be key to the rapid induction seen in pDCs since TLR7 \u2212/\u2212 pDCs could produce IFN in response to CpG DNA and not MHV. This result shows that TLR7 is not needed for CpG DNA induced IFN induction but the lack of TLR7 inhibited the induction of IFN by MHV.

That internalization exposes the genomic RNA to the dsRNA sensing machinery in the cell; TLR3, RIGI and MDA5. These proteins signal the IRF3 cascade leading to induction of IFNb and production of secreted IFN\u03b2 protein. That IFN\u03b2 protein can then bind IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors (INFAR1) on the surface of the same cell or surrounding cells. This activates the Stat1 signaling pathway to activate the many anti-viral genes found with ISRE promoter elements.",

Following fusion with the endosomal compartment the viral genome release into the cytosol where it is translated into the viral replicase proteins ORF1a and 1b[2]. These polyproteins are then cleaved by 2 proteases, Main Protease (Mpro) and Papain like protease, PLP, into the individual proteins necessary for replication[3]. Subgenomic RNA synthesis occurs from discontinuous transcription which joins leader RNA sequences encoded at the 5\u2032 end of the genome to the body sequences of each subgenomic RNA. The eight different subgenomic negative strands serve as template for the synthesis of like sized subgenomic mRNA.[4] Subgenomic RNAs are then translated into viral proteins which localize to their relevant compartments. [5] Assembly of virions occurs in an ERGIC like compartment in the cell. Here S, E, M and N bound to genomic viral RNA are assembled into virions in vesicles. [6] The vesicles are then exported to the cell surface where fusion occurs with release of virions into the exterior environment.
