The reviewed research focused on enzymatic micro-reactors and peptide separation in bottom-up approaches, and protein and peptide separation in top-down approaches. The new enzymatic micro-reactor is able to accelerate proteolytic reaction rate from conventionally a couple of hours to a few seconds, and the multiple dimensional chromatographic-separation with various models or arrays could sufficiently separate the proteomic mixture. These advances have significantly promoted the research of protein/peptide separation and identification in proteomics.",

Compared to genome analysis of a certain species, the proteomic analysis is challenging because of its relatively large population, wide dynamic range, varieties of complexes, and continuous change with time and space. Two approaches have been exploited for proteome analysis. One is the top-down strategy, which involves the separation of proteins by 2D gel electrophoresis, followed by the digestion of specific fractions using a proteolytic enzyme and the identification of proteins by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The other is the bottom-up strategy, which is performed by the initial digestion of all proteins in a sample, followed by the separation of peptides and the identification of proteins by MS/MS.",

The typical protocol for protein digestion is accomplished by enzymatic hydrolysis. However, the conventional digestion performed in solution suffers such drawbacks as enzyme autodigestion, low efficiency, extended incubation time and manual operation. To overcome these shortcomings, more attention has been paid to the immobilized enzymatic reactors [1] . In recent years, numerous enzyme immobilization methods have been developed. Proteolytic enzymes could be covalently bonded, trapped, or physically adsorbed onto different carriers, which in turn significantly affect properties of the immobilized enzyme.",

The 2D-PAGE has limitations in protein analysis for high (>150 kDa) and low (<10 kDa) molecular weight proteins as well as proteins with extreme pI values. Another limitation of 2D-PAGE is that it cannot be on-line coupled with MS to achieve a rapid multi-dimensional protein separation and identification [2] . As a result, multi-dimensional liquid phase based separation methods using different electrophoretic and/or chromatographic techniques have been developed as complementary tools. The feasibility of multi-modular combinations of HPLC, isoelectric focusing (IEF), chromatofocusing (CF), capillary electrophoresis (CE) as well as combinations of different HPLC modes provides numerous options for the separation of protein complexes and peptides.",

They reported protein digestion inside the nanoreactor channels of mesoporous silica of SBA-15, and evaluated the performance by peptide mass mapping [8] . After 10-min incubation, the mass spectrum of the digests released from the mesoporous silica-based nanoreactors revealed the presence of eight peptides covering 58% of the myoglobin sequence with an intense signal (signal/noise ratio >70). In comparison, the conventional overnight in-solution digestion of proteins under otherwise identical conditions generated three peptides (27% sequence coverage). A microchip reactor packed with metal-ion chelated magnetic silica microspheres (200 nm in diameter) was newly developed by the same group [9] . In this investigation, magnetic microspheres were first modified with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), and then reacted with GLYMO-IDA, formed by the reaction of glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GLYMO) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA). The copper ion and trypsin were subsequently introduced onto the surface. Finally, the prepared microspheres were packed into the microchannel by applying a strong magnetic field to make an on-chip enzymatic microreactor. Taking an RPLC fraction of protein extracted from the rat liver as the sample, the digestion could be completed within 5 min, and 23 unique peptides, corresponding to 7 proteins, were identified, demonstrating the potential application in proteome analysis.",

The nano-structured coating was assembled via a layer-by-layer electrostatic binding of poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), as shown in Figure 1 . The maximum proteolytic rate of the immobilized trypsin was 400 mM min \uf02d1 (mg of enzyme) \uf02d1 , and trace proteins down to fmol were digested. By such an enzymatic reactor, proteins isolated from the mouse macrophages were digested, and 497 proteins were identified by 2D-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The same group has explored macroporous materials as novel catalysts for efficient and controllable enzyme micro-reactors [11] . Without increasing the enzyme or protein concentrations, this simple digestion approach exhibits high proteolysis efficiency and selectivity due to the in situ rapid adsorption of both enzymes and proteins from bulk solutions into the macropores of the catalysts, where the target substrates and enzymes are significantly concentrated and confined in the nanospace to realize a rapid digestion. This nanoporous reaction system has been applied to the analysis of a complex biological sample, where 293 proteins were identified, while 100 proteins were obtained by the standard overnight in-solution digestion. Liu et al. have described the kinetics of proteolytic micro-reactions in nanoporous materials [12] , and speculated that the effect of a confined space and the ingress and diffusion of proteins into porous cavities could accelerate or limit the first proteolytic step requiring the encounter between the substrates and enzymes.",

            "text": "Most immobilized enzymatic micro-reactor applications aim at protein identification by peptide mapping. Peptide mapping is typically performed using enzymatic cleavage of the protein, and the resulting degraded products are subsequently identified using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI MS) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI MS). Ekstrom et al. [26] described a microchip enzymatic reactor integrated with a sample pretreatment robot and a microdispenser for transfer of digested proteins directly to a MALDI target plate for automated MS analysis. Such a microchip enzymatic reactor allowed online enzymatic digestion of protein samples within 1-3 min, approximately 200-1000 times faster than digestion in solution. Immobilization of the protease has the advantage of avoiding autolytic interferences from the proteolytic enzyme in the mass spectra. By using porous silicon as a carrier for the immobilized enzyme in the microchip reactor, a large surface area and thus a high catalytic turnover are obtained. This integrated system provided a throughput of 100 samples in 3.5 h. Figure 2 illustrates the process of enzyme immobilization and subsequent protein identification in a multilayer assembled microchip [27] . Such an assembled membrane provides a biocompatible network with high enzyme-loading capacity. The maximum rate of reaction of the adsorbed trypsin in a microchannel was significantly accelerated. The efficient on-chip proteolysis was obtained within a few seconds and the results of protein identification are comparable with those from in-solution digestion. Both a high surface-tovolume ratio and microstructured confinement within the microchannel induce order-of-magnitude enhancement of catalytic efficiency. Wu et al. [28] explored an on-line di-gestion protocol to couple the microreactor integrated with an SST electrode with a replaceable silica-capillarynanospray tip attached to ESI MS. The experimental data shows that the microreactors are suitable for high-throughput analysis of proteins. Numerous micro enzyme-reactors have been developed for biosensors because they are superior in reducing the reaction time and use minimal amount of reagents [29, 30] .",

In comparison to the conventional off-line urea denaturation protocol, even more unique peptides were obtained by online heating in triplicate within a significantly shortened pretreatment time of ~3.5 min (including 1 min of thermal denaturation and reduction and ~2.5 min of microreactor digestion). Proteins with concentrations ranging from 50 ng/mL (~6 fmol) to 1 mg/mL (~120 pmol) were positively identified by the online system. Such a platform was further suc- cessfully applied for analyzing the soluble fraction of mouse liver extract.

A three-dimensional (3D) chromatography in coupling to MS/MS system was reported using SEC as prefractionation prior to online SCX-RPLC-ESI-MS/MS [43] . Normal human liver protein extracts were tryptically digested before and after SEC pre-separation. This SEC-SCX-RPLC method has been demonstrated to have great improvements in both proteome coverage and protein identification confidence compared to 2D-LC-MS. Many mid-and low-abundance proteins as well as proteins with extreme MW or pI were found in this work. Both preand post-proteolytic separations were studied to reveal that 3D chromatography was more effective for complex proteome analysis. Both strategies were recommended to use for complex samples, and the post-proteolytic procedure was more efficient in protein identification.",

Chromatography array technology has challenges because of the complexity and high requirements for HPLC systems. However, much progress has been made in this area. Horn et al. [49] presented a high-throughput procedure for proteome research of native constituents. Human serum sample was first separated with SEC column in a mild condition and collected in a 96-well microplate. 96 Anion exchange columns (AEC) were arranged just as 96-well microplates to separate SEC fractions in a parallel way. All fractions were submitted for quantitative assay and MS identification. The use of microplates as a medium made it possible to fulfill a high-throughput array separation. This could even increase the system resolution by the adoption of a third separation dimension. Zhang et al. developed a capillary array RPLC-based multi-dimensional separation systems coupled with MALDI-TOF-MS/MS for highthroughput proteome research [50, 51] . It includes a SCX column as the first dimension and 10 parallel capillary RPLC columns as the second dimension [50] . A multiplechannel interface was fabricated. Digested proteins extracted from liver cancer tissues were analyzed by the system. Over 1202 proteins were found with one-tenth time needed in common 2DLC system. An automated and optimized system was further developed [51] . Capillary SCX chromatographic column was used as the first dimension and 18 parallel capillary RPLC columns were integrated as the second separation dimension (Figure 4 ). Peptides bound to the SCX phase were eluted using gradient elution. Effluents were sequentially transferred onto each subset of precolumns. After salt fractionation peptide fractions were concurrently back-flushed from the precolumns and separated simultaneously with 18 capillary RP columns.

[51] with permission. effluents were directly deposited onto the MALDI target plates for subsequent MALDI experiments. An 18-fold increase in throughput compared with serial-based 2D-LC system was realized by this new system. The effectiveness of array-based MDLC/MS platform for separation and identification of a complex proteome sample demonstrated that it would be an effective high-throughput way for large-scale proteome research.",

While utilizing top-down approaches, the overall sample complexity could be significantly reduced, and quantitative results and the PTMs could be potentially obtained. A large portion of disease biomarkers is regarded as low-abundance proteins. Peptides of the low-abundance proteins are always covered by plenty of other peptides in the shotgun approach.

Protein samples were first separated with a SCX column and fractions were collected every 2 min. Then SCX fractions were loaded onto RPLC column. Peak intensity of RPLC chromatogram detected by UV absorption was used to distinguish high-abundance proteins from middle-and low-abundance proteins. RPLC fractions with the peak intensity above 0.1AU were taken as high-abundance proteins and depleted. After separations, fractions of high-abundance proteins were tryptically digested and MS/MS analyzed, whereas other fractions defined as middle-and low-abundance proteins were pooled together and submitted for further RPLC-MS/MS analysis ( Figure 5 ).

            "text": "Enzymatic micro-reactors would become increasingly significant to future development and progress in proteomics. Due to the high concentration of trypsin that could be confined in the microscopic micro-cavity or channel, low levels of protein samples could be rapidly digested in the micro-reactor. Immobilized microfluidic reactors are flexible, implying that the approach could be applied in large-scale analysis integrated with separation procedures to implement on-line protein identification. Multi-dimensional liquid chromatography has been widely used in all kinds of biological samples. MDLC coupled with MS has been playing significant roles in proteomic analysis, in both bottom-up and top-down approaches. New progressive strategies using MDLC techniques in high-abundance protein depletion and chromatography arrays would be promising in future proteomic analysis. Authors suggest that the top-down approach may be designable to separate protein mixtures first, and each protein effluent may be digested in an on-line enzymatic-reactor column before an advanced and effective MS identification.",
