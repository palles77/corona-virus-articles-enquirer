Here we compared levels of 17 cytokines and 7 immunoglobulin isotypes in the plasma of these patients against those of a cohort of patients suffering from pneumonia caused by other viruses. Cytokines and immunoglobulins were measured by using Biorad multiplex kits. Respiratory samples were screened for the presence of viruses by using the A(H1N1)pdm09 Detection Set (Roche \u00ae ), the Respiratory Viral Panel-XTAG RVP (Abott \u00ae ) or culturing them on Hep2/Vero/MDCK-SIAT cells. In the non-influenza group (n = 20), the viral aetiology was as follows: Entero/Rhinovirus (n = 7), Metapneumovirus (n = 6), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (n = 5), Coronavirus NL63 (n = 1) and Herpesvirus (n = 1). Patients with influenza (n = 38) were younger (median (yrs), (Fig. 1) .",

However the role-played by systemic IgA in this context is not well known. This work evidences for the first time the existence of lower levels of plasma IgA in patients with viral pneumonia caused by influenza. The potential of IgA in determining viral aetiology along with its participation in the pathogenic events in this disease merits further investigation.",

APACHE II score at admission was also similar in both groups:(median [IQR]): influenza: (18.5 [10]); other viruses: (16.5 [25]) (p = 0.761). Nevertheless, patients with influenza needed more frequently of invasive mechanical ventilation: influenza: 29 out of 38 (76.3%); other viruses: 10 out of 20 (50.0%), p = 0.042. Frequency of bacterial co-infection at admission was also comparable: influenza: 7 out of 38 (18.4%); other viruses: 3 out of 20 (15.0%) p = 0.772. The percentage of fatal cases was higher in the influenza group, although difference was not significant: influenza: 14 out of 38 (36.8%); other viruses: 3 out of 20 (15.0%) p = 0.080.

Conversely, influenza patients showed lower levels of IgA (133.9 [92.8]; 212.1 [308.9]), median (mg/dl), [IQR]) (Fig. 1).
