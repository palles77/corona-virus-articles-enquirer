Affected children typically have fever, cough, and respiratory distress (e.g., retraction, wheezing) [1] . Bronchiolitis is an important issue as it is one of the leading causes of hospitalization among children. The total annual costs for bronchiolitis-related hospitalizations in the United States were $543 million [2] . Approximately 2-3% of affected children require hospitalization for a higher level of care, leading to 149,000 hospitalizations annually [2] . The majority of children with bronchiolitis have mild-to-moderate illness, but 2-6% of hospitalized children require pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, and 2-3% of the hospitalized children need highflow oxygenation or mechanical ventilation [3] .",

            "text": "Established risk factors for hospital admission or PICU admission include prematurity, younger age, the presence of a comorbidity, and environmental factors. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is most frequently associated with bronchiolitis, accounting for 43-74% of all cases [4] . The recent introduction and widespread use of molecular-based methods (real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ) has helped identify an increased number of concomitant viral infections (e.g., metapneumovirus) in addition to RSV in children with acute bronchiolitis. Other viruses frequently found in children with bronchiolitis include rhinovirus, Background: It is unclear whether multiple respiratory viral infections are associated with more severe bronchiolitis requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. We aimed to identify the association between multiple respiratory viral infections and PICU admission among infants with bronchiolitis. Methods: We performed a 1:1 case-control study enrolling previously healthy full-term infants (12 months) with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU as cases and those to the general pediatric ward as controls from 2015 to 2017. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of the respiratory viruses. We summarized the characteristics of infants admitted to the PICU and the general pediatric unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to fit the association between multiple respiratory viral infections (2 strains) and PICU admission. Results: A total of 135 infants admitted to the PICU were compared with 135 randomly selected control infants admitted to the general pediatric unit. The PICU patients were younger (median: 2.2 months, interquartile range: 1.3-4.2) than the general ward patients (median: 3.2 months, interquartile range: 1.6-6.4). Respiratory syncytial virus (74.1%), rhinovirus (28.9%), and coronavirus (5.9%) were the most common viruses for bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission. Patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU tended to have multiple viral infections compared with patients on the general ward (23.0% vs. 10.4%, P < 0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-5.57, P = 0.02). Conclusion: Infants with multiviral bronchiolitis have higher odds of PICU admission compared with those with a single or nondetectable viral infection. C 2019 French Society of Pediatrics.

Concomitant viral infection in hospitalized children with bronchiolitis ranges from 10% to 40% [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, it remains unanswered whether multiple concomitant respiratory viral infections are associated with more severe bronchiolitis. Prior studies were limited for only providing descriptive statistics without accounting for confounders or for having inadequate sample size [10] [11] [12] . It is important to know whether multiple respiratory viral infections are linked to worse respiratory outcomes, since early intensive care given to this vulnerable population might decrease the need for rapid response on the pediatric ward and potentially adverse outcomes. To address these issues, we conducted a case-control study and performed a multivariable regression analysis to determine the association between severe bronchiolitis resulting in PICU admission and the number of viral co-infections among previously healthy infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis, while accounting for confounders.",

This was a 1:1 case-control study of infants aged 12 months or younger who were admitted to our 18bed tertiary care pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The study sample was chosen based on the ICD code for bronchiolitis during the study period. Infants with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU were identified as cases and were compared with infants with bronchiolitis admitted to the general pediatric unit as controls. As cases, we included all patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU from whom a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sample had been collected for real-time multiplex PCR at our institution from January 2015 to December 2017. PCR analysis was performed based on the physician's decision regarding the need for additional testing that might change patient management. As controls, the same number of neonates (<28 days; n = 20) and infants (n = 135) were randomly selected among the 890 patients (age 1 year) with bronchiolitis admitted to the general pediatric unit, and for whom PCR was performed during the same study period, using a random sampling method. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether there was a significant difference between patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the general pediatric unit for whom PCR was performed and those for whom PCR was not performed. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of eligible patients and documented the demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data. Patients who were premature or had significant underlying medical illness (e.g., tracheostomy, baseline oxygen requirement, cyanotic heart disease, chromosomal disorders, neurologic disorders) were excluded from the study.",

The RSV detection rates of 74% and 59% for cases and controls, respectively, were compatible with historical numbers (60-80%) reported in various studies [14] [15] [16] . Similarly, rhinovirus was the second most common virus found in 27% and 12% of the children admitted to the PICU and the general pediatric ward, respectively, while the detection rate reported in the literature was 20-40% [10, 12, 17] . Interestingly, different from the results reported in previous studies, the third most common virus detected among children admitted to the PICU in this study varies according to the year. Potential reasons could be the yearly and geographical variation in the viral prevalence. Secondly, different study populations might partially explain the variation, as the majority of patients in southern Texas are of Hispanic origin. Similar observations were also reported in studies from France and Taiwan, where only RSV was consistently found to be the most common of all viruses [7, 8] .",

            "text": "Consistent with the prevalence reported in previous studies [18] , our findings revealed that infection with multiple respiratory viruses accounts for 10% and 22% of children admitted to the general ward and the PICU, respectively. Further, we found a significantly higher percentage of multiple viral infections among the PICU cohort. Additionally, the results of multivariable analyses suggest that multiple respiratory viral infections were independently associated with higher odds of severe bronchiolitis leading to PICU admission, while accounting for confounders. This finding is different from the results reported by Nascimento et al., who suggested no significant association between multiple viral infections and PICU admission for children admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis [12] . Several reasons might explain the difference. First, the study populations might be different. Patient selection bias might exist in their study considering that the study was conducted in a neighborhood of residents of high socioeconomic status. Secondly, their relatively small sample size (n = 77) might not afford adequate statistical power to determine the significant association between multiple viral infections and PICU admission. In fact, our findings from multivariable analyses agree with the results of a retrospective study by Richard et al. [8] , in which multiple respiratory viral infections were found to associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2-6.2, P = 0.02) on multivariable analysis. In addition to having higher odds of PICU admission, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was found to be associated with prolonged PICU stay in a British retrospective cohort study enrolling children under 2 years of age admitted to the PICU for bronchiolitis [17] . The intriguing finding that infection with multiple respiratory viruses is associated with more severe bronchiolitis is biologically plausible via several proposed mechanisms, including virusderived disruption of the epithelium and modification of the host immune system [19] . Taken together, infection with multiple respiratory viruses is associated with more severe bronchiolitis and prolonged PICU stay. Real-time multiplex PCR that detects the presence of nucleic acid from several viruses or bacteria from nasopharyngeal secretion in a single test allows for timely recognition of pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity [20] . While the rapid recognition of pathogens may help clinicians make decisions, one must be aware that the presence of viral nucleic acid based on PCR does not mean active viral infection, as it could result from subclinical viral infection or prior viral infection since the viral nucleic acid remnant may last up to 4 weeks after infection [21, 22] . Therefore, the results of multiplex PCR must be interpreted together with the patients' clinical presentation. However, there is also evidence suggesting that subclinical viral infection leads to alteration of the host-microbe composition of the respiratory tract, which might be linked to subsequent dysregulation in host immune function associated with development of asthma or against bacterial infection [23, 24] . The impact of altered microbiota in the respiratory tract after viral infections awaits future studies.",

Furthermore, there is no consensus on when respiratory PCR should be performed for pediatric patients. In general, respiratory PCR is recommended for neonates, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with chronic cardiopulmonary illness because a positive result might consequently lead to antiviral/antimicrobial treatments or clinical interventions. Based on the findings of this study, we also recommend respiratory PCR for patients with a more severe presentation of bronchiolitis as it may help clinicians decide on the patient's condition and the level of care needed. This is because patients with a more severe presentation of bronchiolitis with unremarkable chest X-rays but positive PCR results for co-infection with multiple viruses might benefit from closer monitoring as they are more likely to experience a more severe course of bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission.",

Our study reconfirms the independent association between multiple respiratory viral infections and severe bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission. However, this study has several limitations. First, using PICU admission as a surrogate outcome for severe bronchiolitis might introduce bias. It might not reflect directly the respiratory burden imposed by the multiple viral infections as accurately as respiratory rate or oxygen saturation level. Nevertheless, using PICU admission as a surrogate outcome takes account of the cumulative impact of respiratory viral infections, not only on the respiratory system but also on other organ systems, and of the interventions already administered. Therefore, it is reasonable to use of PICU admission as a surrogate outcome. Second, as with other retrospective studies, our results might be confounded by non-measured variables, such as exposure to cigarettes, duration of breastfeeding, number of siblings, socioeconomic status, personal or family history of atopy, or undiagnosed asthma. As our study subjects were previously healthy full-term infants, the extent of the confounding effect would be to a lesser degree. Further, adjustment for the use of steroids, inhaled corticosteroids, and antibiotics in the multivariable analysis helps control these confounding effects. Third, our study population is relatively selective as we only enrolled previously healthy full-term infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis who had respiratory viral panel testing via PCR. Thus, the results might not be generalizable to other populations (e.g., premature infants). Furthermore, the decision regarding admission to the PICU might not be entirely objective, as it was at the discretion of clinicians who could not be entirely blinded to the patients' clinical status. However, at our institution there were established criteria that prevent unjustifiable admission to the PICU. Fourth, as with other clinical studies using ICD codes to ascertain diseases from administrative databases, our study is also at risk of misclassification bias as the bronchiolitis might be erroneously diagnosed or missed. Fifth, one must be aware that positive PCR results do not necessarily mean active infection, as there could be viral residual shedding from previous infections. PCR should always be interpreted along with the patients' clinical presentation.",
