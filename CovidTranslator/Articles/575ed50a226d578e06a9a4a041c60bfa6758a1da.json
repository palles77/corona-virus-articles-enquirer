IFN-\u03b3-induced enhancement of NOS-1 activity is crucial for its antiviral activity in the central nervous system. IFN-\u03b3 treatment of neuronal cells results in an increase of total NOS-1 and decrease of total PIN proteins without alteration in their respective mRNA levels. PIN/NOS-1 complexes decreased after IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Transfection of cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for PIN results in a higher constitutive activity of NOS-1 and inhibition of viral replication. IFN-\u03b3 treatment did not change the amount of NOS-1 detectable by Western blot, when PIN is diminished by RNAi treatment. Overexpression of PIN results in lower constitutive NOS-1 expression and activity, and diminishes activation of NOS-1 by IFN-\u03b3. Our findings indicate that in neurons, IFN-\u03b3 upregulates NOS-1 through proteasomal degradation of PIN.",

IFN-\u03b3 treatment results in nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS-1) accumulation posttranscriptionally. Viral clearance from neurons is associated with increased NO production both in vitro and in the CNS (Bi and Reiss, 1995; Komatsu et al., 1996; Chesler et al., 2004) . The regulation and the mechanism of this phenomenon largely remain unknown. Protein inhibitor of NOS-1 (PIN) is degraded following IFN-\u03b3 treatment; more ubiquitin-modified PIN and a shorter half-life are observed in IFN-\u03b3-treated neuronal cells (Yang et al., 2006) . We propose that PIN is centrally involved in the IFN-\u03b3-mediated accumulation of NOS-1 and antiviral responses in neurons.",

Of the three NOS isoforms, NOS-1 is the largest due to a 300-amino-acid PDZ (PSD-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1) domain insertion at the N terminus, targeting the protein to the postsynaptic density (PSD). Several proteins have been identified to interact with NOS-1 in neurons and modulate its activity. The PSD protein PSD-95 binds and anchors NOS-1 in a complex with the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) (Christopherson et al., 1999) . Carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of nNOS (CAPON) competes with PSD-95 for interaction with NOS-1 in the PSD of synaptic spines (Jaffrey et al., 1998) , and is thought to reduce the capability of NOS-1 to produce NO. Nitric oxide synthaseinteracting protein (NO-SIP) interacts and colocalizes with NOS-1 in synaptic spines and inhibits NOS activity (Dreyer et al., 2004) . In the CNS, NOS-1 is activated by Ca 2+ influx through the NMDA glutamate receptor, triggering of the NMDAR kinase (Putzke et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "A 10 kDa protein that physically interacts with and inhibits the activity of NOS-1 was identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen. The protein was named Protein Inhibitor of Neuronal NOS (Jaffrey and Snyder, 1996a) . PIN and NMDAR colocalize with NOS-1 in penile nerves (Ferrini et al., 2003) . The PIN-binding region of NOS-1 maps to a 17-residue peptide fragment from Met-228 to His-244 of NOS-1 (Fan et al., 1998) . PIN binding destabilizes the NOS-1 homodimer, a conformation necessary for enzymatic activity (Dunbar et al., 2004) . Prostaglandin E2, an inhibitor of NOS-1, induces PIN expression in neurons; Celecoxib \u2122 treatment, which enhances NOS-1 activity, inhibits PIN expression (Chen and Reiss, 2002) . In addition, PIN inhibits NO and superoxide production by purified NOS-1 (Xia et al., 2006) . IFN-\u03b3 treatment prolongs the half-life of NOS-1 (Yang et al., 2006) . In neurons, PIN is posttranscriptionally downregulated by IFN-\u03b3 treatment; more ubiquitination and faster degradation of PIN are detected in IFN-\u03b3-treated samples (Yang et al., 2006) . In this study, we examine the turnover and interaction of PIN and NOS-1 following IFN-\u03b3 treatment. To assess this, RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression techniques were employed. The results demonstrate that in neuronal cells, IFN-\u03b3 enhances NOS-1 and antiviral activity through down-regulation of PIN.",

In PINoverexpressing neuronal cells, we observed lower constitutive NOS-1 activity, and diminished activation of NOS-1 by IFN-\u03b3 compared with the control cells (Figs. 4 and 5, and Supplemental Fig. 2) .

            "text": "In the CNS, IFN-\u03b3's functions are related to the modulation of the immune system and the control of the infectious diseases. Elevated expression of IFN-\u03b3 was observed in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-infected brain and may play an important role in neuropathological pathways of HIV-related encephalopathy (Koedel et al., 1999; Shapshak et al., 2004) . IFN-\u03b3-producing \u03b3\u03b4T cells may help control murine West Nile virus infection (Wang et al., 2003) . The murine coronavirus, JHMV, infects a variety of CNS cell types during the acute phase of infection. In IFN-\u03b3 KO mice, increased morbidity and mortality were associated with persistent virus replication, indicating a role of the cytokine in control of viral replication (Parra et al., 1999) . These diverse viral infections illustrate the importance of IFN\u03b3 in the immune modulation and clearance of viruses from the CNS. NO-dependent antiviral activity has been found in a variety of neurotropic virus infections, including CMV (Kosugi et al., 2002) , HIV (Hori et al., 1999) , herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (Kodukula et al., 1999) , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Lane et al., 1997) , poliovirus (Komatsu et al., 1996) , and reovirus (Goody et al., 2005) . Several studies have suggested possible mechanisms by which viral replication is inhibited by NO. Peroxynitrite, ONOO(\u2212), was reported to react with tyrosines, serines, and cysteines of proteins, and results in NO 2 Y, NO 2 S, and NO 2 C (Gu et al., 2002) . Such modifications could alter the activity of a viral polymerase or other viral proteins that are critically involved in virus life cycle, or affect host proteins required for virus assembly to attenuate viral infection (Simon et al., 1996; Saura et al., 1999) .",

However, the effect of PIN on degradation and NO production of NOS-1 in the neurons has not been examined. Utilizing overexpression and siRNA, as well as the sandwich ELISA technique, we not only explore the role of PIN in the IFN-\u03b3-mediated accumulation and activation of NOS-1, but also quantitate the PIN:NOS ratio over the course of IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Our findings provide important insights into IFN-\u03b3-mediated antiviral responses in neurons.",

Mutagenesis of this new plasmid was conducted by constructing a one-nucleotide insertion in the PIN sequence, using Stratagene QuickChange kit (La Jolla, CA). Primers used for mutagenesis are listed inTable 1. The PCR was programmed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 18 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 68\u00b0C for 6 min, and then 4\u00b0C hold. PCR products were digested with Dpn to remove original template and purified with a Qiagen gel extraction kit. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. \u03bcg of plasmid diluted in 75 \u03bcL of DNA diluent and 15 \u03bcL of the Lipofectamine2000 reagent diluted in 60 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM. The DNA was then added to the transfection reagent and incubated for 10 min at RT for complex formation.",
