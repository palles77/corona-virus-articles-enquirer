Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown.",

The number of mutations and the mutation rate vary greatly between viruses, between genes, and even between gene regions. The mutation rate of an organism, i.e. the frequency of mutations occurring in a given time, is inversely proportional to its size. This implies that any virus has a higher mutation rate than a procaryotic or eucaryotic organism. RNA viruses generally mutate more rapidly than DNA viruses. This is believed to be due to the lack of an error-correcting activity in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases during virus replication. Because of immunological pressure the mutation rate of surface protein genes is generally higher than that of the genes encoding internal structural proteins or of nonstructural proteins.",

            "text": "Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) has been known for decades. It can cause an acute systemic disease in cats resulting in a profound leukopenia and enteritis. The virus was known only from cats or raccoons until in the mid-1940s when a very similar disease with a high mortality was observed in mink. The mink agent named mink enteritis virus (MEV) , was indistinguishable from FPV by conventional serological and biochemical tests, and was subsequently classified as a virulence variant of FPV. In 1978, another virus emerged in yet another carnivore species, the dog. Again the symptoms resembled the well known clinical picture seen for FPV infection of cats, and the virus isolated from diseased dogs was initially indistinguishable from FPV. This new virus, canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), was responsible for a devastating pandemic affecting virtually all dog populations worldwide. The reasons for the rapid and global spread of this virus were its high contagiousness and its remarkable tenacity. It hit an unprotected dog population and killed initially thousands of dogs. The origin and the mechanisms of the virus evolution have been subject of great interest, and it is now generally believed that CPV was derived from feline panleukopenia virus or a closely related carnivore parvovirus that gained the canine host rangealthough its true origin still remains to be discovered. This virus system offers a nearly unique opportunity to study virus evolution on the molecular level for several reasons. First, parvoviruses are relatively simply organized viruses with a small DNA genome of about 5 kb, making genetic manipulations feasible. Secondly, the new virus CPV emerged during the mid 1970s when techniques in virus and tissue conservation were well developed. This renders the preservation of potential ancestor viruses in some diagnostic laboratories or histopathologic collections highly likely.",

Other hypotheses have been that it could have been derived from a virus of a different carnivore such as the Arctic (blue) fox (Veijaleinen, 1988 ; U. Truyen and C.R. Parrish, unpublished results), or that it could have been generated from canine cells contaminated with FPV and then subsequent adaption of that virus to canine cells in vitro and distribution via contaminated vaccines (Siegl, 1984) .",

Further studies, however, have not yet confirmed that hypothesis. Interestingly, CPV-2 continues to show an ongoing evolution. Since its emergence in the mid 1970s two new antigenic types, designated CPV-2a and CPV-2b, have arisen consecutively, and each of the new virus types almost completely replaced the older types (Parrish et al., 1985; Parrish et al., 1988; Parrish et al., 1991) . The mechanisms of that evolution are not clear, but may be at least in part due to immunological selection, as each new antigenic type has lost one neutralizing epitope compared with the former strain (Strassheim et al., 1994 ).",

Orthomyxoviruses have a segmented negative stranded RNA genome, where each of the eight segments codes for one or two structural or non-structural viral proteins, and each is replicated independently.

For those functions it has to undergo a proteolytic cleavage which is mediated by host specific trypsin-like proteases which cleave the precursor HA0 into the active subunits HA1 and HA2. These subunits are linked by disulfide bridges, and are organized as homotrimers. The cleavability of the HA is a determinant of virulence but probably not of host range, as there are cells which do cleave the HA but which still do not replicate the virus (Chambers et al., 1988) . Indirectly, however, it might have some influence on host range, in that the cleaved HA is less stable at low pHs than the uncleaved HAO, which may be important when transmission modes are used that involve fluids of low PH. More likely to influence the host range is the receptor specificity of the various HA subtypes as influenza strains from different hosts have different receptor specificities. The receptor for influenza viruses has been shown to involve sialic acid. Different HA subtypes bind specifically to certain sialyloligosaccharides.",

            "text": "In Km-u the mode of transmission was shown to be the ritual cannibalism among the Fore tribe in Papua-New Guinea. Generally only women and children acquired the disease and only very rarely men. Women were responsible for the dissection of the dead kinsmen and the preparation of the meal. During the mourning ritual all flesh of dead kinsmen was prepared on hot stones and cooked in bamboo cylinders, and those materials were rarely washed or changed. During the preparation of the meal the soiled hands of the women were cleaned by rubbing them in their armpits or elsewhere on their bodies. Any abrasions of the skin were potential locations for efficient inoculation and the transmission via local wounds is generally thought to have been the main route of transmission (Gajdusek, 1977) . After learning about the epidemiology and uncovering the cannibalism as the main source of infection the Fore people have stopped the ritual cannibalism and no more new infections have been reported. The origin of the first case of Kuru is unknown, but a source from a spontaneous case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is suspected. A very similar general epidemiology was seen with BSE in the United Kingdom. In 1985 an apparently new central nervous disease was observed in British cattle. It strongly resembled the known symptoms of scrapie in sheep and it was soon obvious that both diseases and agents were very similar, if not identical. The appearance of BSE is thought to be due to the feeding of carcasses of scrapie-infected sheep via meat meal preparations to cattle. The agent has a remarkable resistance against heating, and even temperatures around 100\u00b0C for hours do not significantly reduce infectivity. A change in the rendering processing of meat meal and a peak in the sheep population in the UK most likely led to the appearance of the disease in 1985 (Wilesmith et al., 1988) . The processing of the carcasses, heating of the carcasses, and treatment with organic solvents was reduced. This apparently enabled the agent to survive the remaining harsh rendering processing procedures and to stay infectious in the final product. Subsequently, the agent may have infected cattle and the first animals which succumbed to clinical disease may have been included in the bone meal production, thereby amplifying transmission and spread among the cattle population of the UK. After elucidation of this epidemiology, the feeding of meat meal to ruminants was banned and with a delay corresponding to an incubation period of 5-7 years the incidence of BSE appears to have reached a plateau during 1993, and is expected to decrease rapidly and to finally vanish in the very near future.",

It was known that cats were susceptible to experimental infection with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent (Mitrova and Mayer, 1977) ) and experimental inoculation of BSE material into cats reproduced the disease. Although not formerly proven from plain epidemiological data, the emergence of FSE (feline spongiform encephalopathy (as it was soon termed) ) is most likely due to the feeding of BSE contaminated bovine tissues to cats. Two wild felid species, the cheetah and the puma were diagnosed with FSE in 1992 in zoos in the UK and Australia. The two cheetahs were born in the same zoo developed the disease after feeding tissues including spinal cord from fallen cattle before the general awareness of BSE in the UK. One of the cheetahs was exported to Australia during the incubation period (summarized by Bradley and Wilesmith, 1993) . The emergence of FSE is a further example of the emergence of a new foodbome infectious disease by introducing an until then unknown or very uncommon infectious agent into the foodchain.",

The role of chimpanzees therefore remains obscure, but the elucidation of the source of HIV infection in that chimpanzee appears to be important to understand the role of great apes in the evolution of HIV-1.",

FIV has been isolated from cats around the world and the FIV antibody prevalence varies between 1 and 30% (Ishida et al., 1988) . Several isolates have been obtained independently from American, European and Asian countries and comparisons of the nucleotide sequence of FIV proviral DNA indicated that the FIV genome organization is similar to that of HIV and other lentiviruses (Spencer et al., 1992) . It is interesting to note that there is also an antigenic cross-reactivity between the major FIV core protein encoded by the gag gene and that of other lentiviruses such as maedi-visna virus, caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus, and equine infectious anaemia viruses (Schneider et al., 1986) . Although all these viruses exhibit a strong species-specificity and do not create a hygienic risk for humans, the antigenic relationship suggests a common evolutionary ancestor. Whereas the gag gene of different FIV isolates appears to be highly conserved, sequence analyses of the enu gene from different American, European and Japanese isolates revealed a clustered variability. Beside that variation in the sequence, however, the structural comparison of the envelope glycoprotein also showed conserved regions between the isolates. Rigby et al. ( 1993) determined 16 fully conserved cysteine residues in the envelope glycoprotein and six in the transmembrane protein. A phylogenetic study of the Ed and gag sequences indicated that the FIV RNA sequences clearly form geographical clusters and that the Japanese FIV isolate represents a different subgroup of feline lentivirnses with calculated amino acid homologies of 77% for the em and 92% for the gag genes (Rigby et al., 1993) . This variety of phylogenetic groups may be related to an intensive world-wide trade in pet cats.",

Although the phylogenetic analysis of FIV and PLV sequences from disparate geographic locations showed a significant divergence between the domestic and non-domestic feline immunodeficiency isolates, both viruses appear to have a common ancestor and are widely distributed in felides around the world.

However, a similarity of 97% of the deduced amino acid sequence between the fusion ( FO) membrane glycoprotein of CDV and PDV-2 contrasting to 86% between PDV-1 and PDV-2 prompted the suggestion that PDV-2 may have evolved from prototype CDV by recent interspecies transmission from terrestrial carnivores (Visser et al., 1993a) .

In the case of PDV-1 -infected harbor seals of the North Sea the attention fixed on vagrant Arctic harp seals (Phoca groenlundica) for several reasons: PDV-l-specific antibodies are highly prevalent in this species (Markussen and Have, 1992) , PDV antigen has recently been detected in a diseased harp seal (Daousi et al., 1993) ) and the population size is large enough to perpetuate endemic morbillivirus infections. In addition, harp seals are known to have migrated in small groups over unusually large distances into European waters in 1987, possibly forced by changes in their natural environment. Whether the 1988 European seal epizootic can be explained solely by introduction of PDV-1 by migrating Arctic seals is still under discussion. Data that would elucidate the situation in cetaceans are still too scarce to allow reliable conclusions.",

It was reported that as many as 85% of cats in individual catteries or multi-cat households were found to have coronavirus-specific antibodies (Hoskins, 1993) . FECV and FIPV are antigenically closely related and generally induce an asymptomatic carrier state in adult cats. Virulent strains of FIPV, such as FIPV-79-1146 and FIPV-DF2, however, can cause a disease with gastrointestinal signs, fibrinous serositis and disseminated vasculitis known as feline infectious peritonitis. Strains of low virulence (e.g. FIPV-UCD2 and FIPV-UCD3) generally induce persistent infections without clinical manifestations. Although the clinical symptoms of the effusive form of FIP are rather obvious, FIP was firstly diagnosed only in the mid 1960s. These observations suggest that FIPV may have emerged as a new virus most likely by recombination with another coronavirus. The most likely candidate for such a genetic event is TGEV, the agent of transmissible gastroenteritis of swine. A genetic relationship between TGEV and FIPV was already suggested from transmission experiments whereby the cat coronavirus induced mild gastrointestinal disorders in piglets whereas TGEV although capable of replicating in cats proved to be non-pathogenic.",

These data suggest that FIPV emerged by intertypic recombination between TGEV and a yet unknown coronavirus, may be FECV (Pedersen et al., 1981) . Homologous recombination between highly conserved RNA sequences at predicted genes ('hot spots') is well documented for other coronaviruses and was especially described for the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (Banner and Lai, 1988) . The general mutation frequency for RNA viruses is assumed to be about 10e4 mutations per base. Considering that the genome of coronaviruses such as TGEV and FIPV is 30 kb, a single replication step of these viruses may involve a substitution of three 'false' bases, The existence of different virulent FIPV strains indicates that genetic variation is also a common characteristic of this virus (Hoskins, 1993) .",

Phylogenetic evidence suggests that an interspecies transmission from a duck virus to humans occurred before 1918, replacing the then prevalent human H3N8 strains. This HlNl virus most likely emerged in North America and was carried to Europe by American world war I troops. This virus acquired three gene segments (HA, NA, PB) from a H2N2 duck virus by reassortment, generating a virus that caused the \"Asian flu\" pandemic in 1957. The HA and PB gene segments were replaced in 1968 by an H3N? duck virus, creating the \"Hong-Kong flu\" pandemic virus. This virus is still prevalent today. All new strains replaced the older strains. Surprisingly, the HlNl known from 'Spanish flu\", which disappeared in 1950, reappeared in 1977. It is suggested that this virus escaped from a laboratory where it was stored during those years.influenza 1 virus emerged",
