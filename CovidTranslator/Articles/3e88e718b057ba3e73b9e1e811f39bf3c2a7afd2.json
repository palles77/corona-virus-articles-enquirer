            "text": "One of the greatest challenges of modern immunology is the development of effective vaccines for such diverse diseases as cancer, hepatitis, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Conventionally, viral and bacterial vaccines have consisted of attenuated (nonvirulent) strains of the pathogenic organism, or stocks which have been inactivated by heat, chemical treatment, or irradiation. However, each of these methods carries the inherent risk that the vaccine may itself induce the disease, due to incomplete inactivation or the appearance of a virulent revertant in an attenuated strain. Modern molecular biology has offered alternative methods of producing safe and effective microbial vaccines, including expression of recombinant antigenic epitopes in nonpathogenic carriers such as vaccinia virus [1] . While this approach is valid for strongly immunogenic viral or bacterial epitopes, it is less promising in tumor systems involving less well-defined and more weakly immunogenic tumor antigens. Thus, the development of effective tumor vaccines still poses a significant challenge to modern immunologists.",

In this view of the immune system, antibodies interact not only with nominal antigen, but also with other antibody molecules during the course of an immune response. The antibody variable region contains two important sites necessary for these interactions to occur. They include the paratope (antigen combining site) and the idiotope, an immunogenic site which can be bound by the paratopes of other antibody molecules. A collection of unique idiotopes borne by any individual antibody is collectively referred to as the idiotype (Id) of that molecule. The immune system can thus be viewed as a network of interacting elements, which express unique Ids capable of eliciting specific anti-Id responses.",

Likewise, Ab2 can stimulate a third population of lymphocytes expressing antianti-Id antibodies (Ab3) which recognize and bind Ab2. A subset of the Ab3 response (Ab 1') can also bind the original antigen. Thus, at least a portion of the Ab2 response possesses the capacity to stimulate an antigen-specific immune response.

However, many reports have implicated antigen-specific and Id-specific regulatory T lymphocytes in Id-based regulation of immune responses [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . These findings suggest that Idspecific T cells can interact with B cells to regulate Id ~, antigen-specific immune responses and that Id-directed B-T lymphocyte cooperation is conceivably a general physiologic phenomenon. The recognition of Id determinants by T cells confers an added level of complexity to network regulation since B-T lymphocyte interactions may have either an inhibitory or stimulatory effect on a particular antigen-specific B cell, depending on the spectrum oflymphokines produced by the T cell. The added dimension of T cell involvement in Id-based regulation does not contradict the basic tenets of the immune network theory but instead may supplement it in a more global manner.",

The Ab 1 is then used as an immunogen to elicit an anti-Id antibody (Ab2). Ideally, the Id borne by Ab 1 should be located in, or sufficiently near, the antigen combining site of the antibody (paratope-associated), be interspecies cross-reactive, and be able to induce a second population of anti-Id antibody (Ab2). An Ab2 generated in this manner may present a complementary three-dimensional conformation sufficiently similar to the original viral epitope defined by Ab 1. Exposure to the anti-Id alone could conceivably mimic the effects of exposure to viral epitopes or virus-induced antigens with none of the potential negative consequences. This idea is appealing with regard to the development of alternative vaccine strategies since anti-Ids could potentially supersede antigen in induction of Id \u00a7 antigenspecific responses. This approach is obviously attractive when considering vaccines against HIV, hepatitis, or other pathogens where employment of conventional vaccines (containing killed or attenuated virus) may be risky. Our laboratory has been investigating antigen-independent modulation of immunity by monoclonal antibodies to both viral and nonviral antigens. In one system [13-15], we examined antibody-induced immune responses to a Moloney murine leukemia virusinduced cell surface antigen (MCSA). We also investigated antigen-independent immune responses to the well-defined M460 Id [16, 17] , which is associated with the BALB/c immune response to the hapten 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP).

The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) bind a cytoplasmic and cell surface Friend-Moloney-Rauscher group-specific antigen as determined by ELISA and immunofluorescence. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed antibody binding to virus-infected cell surfaces, but not to budding or mature virus particles [13] . In agreement with the immunoelectron microscopy, the mAbs were unable to neutralize virus, but were active in complementmediated and cell-mediated cytotoxicity of infected cells, suggesting that these antibodies were specific for the gp85gag cell surface antigen. To test this hypothesis, we obtained a mutant clone of M-MuLV [30] which produces infectious virus, but lacks the genes for the transmembrane leader sequence and thus does not produce glycosylated cell surface gp85gag. When NIH3T3 cells were transfected with proviral DNA from both mutant and wild-type M-MuLV, both cells expressed cytoplasmic antigen detectable by immunofluorescence with one of our IgM mAb. However, only cells transfected with the wildtype proviral DNA (containing cell surface gp85gag) were susceptible to complement-me-diated lysis induced by this antibody. These data provide direct evidence that the cell surface target of these antibodies is an epitope contained within gp85gag. The in vitro characterization of these mAbs is summarized in table 2 [ 14] .",

Twice a week thereafter, the mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with either MCSA-specific mAb, an isotype-matched control mAb, or saline. Tumor size was measured at the site of virus injection every 3-4 days. In a representative experiment shown in figure 2 , two of the MCSA-specific mAbs (KL-5 and KL-9) demonstrated pronounced in vivo antitumor activity, providing complete or nearly complete protection from tumor development. This effect was not due to nonspecific activity of the IgM mAbs, since mice treated with the control mAb, MOPC104E, were not protected from tumor development. The in vivo protective effect of MCSA-specific IgM was partially dependent on the presence of functional T cells. When athymic (nu/nu) and euthymic (nu/+) mice were inoculated with virus, then treated with mAb, sarcoma development and growth could be inhibited, and survival time increased, in nu/nu mice receiving M-MuSVspecific IgM [data not shown].

There are several possible mechanisms. The most direct mechanism of protec- 296 Baskin/Powell/Srinivas/Elliott/Lamon Antigen-Independent Regulation of Immune Responses tion might be simple neutralization of the virus inoculum, thus preventing the infection and transformation of cells in vivo. However, as stated previously, none of the mAbs were capable of neutralizing virus when tested in vitro; therefore, this possibility is unlikely to explain in vivo antitumor activity. Thus, we considered mechanisms directed at virus-infected cells, rather than free virus particles. The mAbs are known to exhibit both complement-and cell-mediated lysis of infected cells in vitro (see table 2), so it is possible that these effector arms of the immune response were involved following binding of the mAb to the target antigen on infected cells, leading to lysis of the tumor cells. Both of these mechanisms are specific, but passive, in that activation of antigen-specific lymphocytes is not required to generate either the components of the complement cascade or effector cells capable of mediating antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Therefore, we investigated the hypothesis IgM, ~: PC -H and L represent H and L chain composition of each mAb determined by ELISA.

Thirty days after virus injection, spleen cells from virus-inoculated mice were assayed for cytotoxic activity against M-MuSV-transformed target cells.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the MCSA-specific antibody response in the sera of mice treated with Ab 1. Mice were inoculated with virus, with or without subsequent IgM Abl administration as described above, and observed for tumor development. At various time points during the course of tumor development and regression, sera were collected and examined for titers of MCSA-specific antibodies in an ELISA [ 14 ] .

The 298 Baskin/PoweU/Srinivas/Elliott/Lamon Antigen-Independent Regulation of Immune Responses results of this serological assay paralleled those of the cellular assay described above, i.e., higher titers of MCSA-specific non-IgM antibodies were found in the sera of mice which had received IgM mAb injections following virus inoculation, compared to those animals which were inoculated with virus only (fig. 3 ). The MCSA-specific serum antibodies induced by IgM Abl administration were predominantly of the IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, with minor contributions from the IgG2b and IgG3 isotypes. The presence of MCSA-specific IgG1 is particularly intriguing, since this isotype is almost completely absent from the normal antibody response to virus challenge in BALB/c mice [14 ] .

As described above, Ab 1-immunized mice displayed high titers of anti-gen-specific antibodies, as well as increased cytotoxic cellular activity, but were no more resistant to tumor development than naive control mice. When mice were immunized with Ab2 prior to virus challenge, however, effective immunity was achieved [15] . The Ab2-immunized mice experienced a 65-70% reduction in tumor size during peak tumor development (7-9 days after virus challenge), with an overall reduction in tumor load for the entire course of the experiment of 75% when compared to nonimmune euthymic controls ( fig. 7) . This protective effect appeared to be T cell-dependent, since athymic (nu/nu) mice immunized with Ab2 were not protected against sarcoma growth. (The apparent decrease in tumor size of the athymic mice after day 8 is due to death of mice with 302 Baskin/Powell/Srinivas/Elliott/Lamon Antigen-lndependent Regulation of Immune Responses Fig. 7 .

The mice were rested 7 days following the last injection, then challenged with M-MuSV/ M-MuLV intramuscularly in the right thigh. Thigh diameters were measured for 28 days. The results are presented as the geometric mean increase in thigh diameter for each group. The logl0 mean + SEM (and geometric mean) of percent of control tumor burden for the euthymic mice were 2.00 + 0.09 (100) for the normal mice, and 1.40 -+ 0.06 (25) for the RSI.I.3immunized mice; this represents a significant reduction (p < 0.005, Student's t test). The apparent decrease in mean tumor size after day 9 in the athymic mice is due to the death of the mice with the largest tumors at that time, and not to true reduction in tumor size. It should be noted that all athymic mice died from tumor growth by day 15, whereas all euthymic mice showed complete regression of tumors by day 27 [modified from 15]. the largest tumors and not due to tumor regression). All athymic mice died by day 15 after virus challenge while their nu/+ littermates completely recovered from tumor development.

The mechanism for this increased susceptibility to tumor development is unclear, but may be due to a competitive interaction between the Ab2 and the virus-induced tumor antigens. Perhaps the Ab2 interacts with Id + B cells and/or T cells, preventing these responses from acting against the antigens displayed on the tumor cells. Therefore, Ab2 administration is effective prophylactically but not therapeutically, the converse of which is true for Ab 1 administration (see above).",

The mice were then rested until adulthood (6-8 weeks) and challenged with an oncogenic dose of virus. The results were quite surprising. Mice which had been neonatatly injected with Ab2, in an attempt to eliminate Id \u00a7 lymphocytes, experienced no significant change in their susceptibility to tumor development compared to control littermates (79 % of control tumor burden; p > 0.10). If the Id \u00a7 lymphocytes were indeed eliminated, these data suggest that alternative Ids were activated upon virus challenge, resulting in normal resistance to tumor development. However, mice which had been injected with Ab 1, in an attempt to eliminate anti-Id lymphocytes, developed much larger tumors than control littermates (553 % of control tumor burden; p < 0.0005). These data suggest that elimination of anti-Id lymphocytes rendered the mice less able to effectively respond to virus challenge. This is surprising, since anti-Id lymphocytes would be expected to exert a feedback regulatory effect on the antitumor response, and thus their elimination would allow the antitumor response to proceed more vigorously. It seems, therefore, that the anti-Id lymphocytes play important positive, rather than negative, regulatory roles in the antitumor response. At the very least, these data emphasize the importance of a balanced Id cascade in response to virus challenge.",

The Id-specific IgG1 antibody titer against DNPspecific IgM mAb was greater than 4,000; however when the same sera were tested against a panel of idiotypically distinct monoclonal antibodies, IgG 1 titers were not signifi-cantly different from those found in normal serum [ 16] . The response was not anti-isotypic since immune sera did not bind any of the other IgM mAb in the panel. The exquisite specificity of the serum Ab2 response in DNP-specific IgM injected mice indicates that the response is directed against individual idiotopes on the injected antibody.

            "text": "In the previous study, it was shown that injection of DNP-specific IgM (Abl), in the absence of adjuvants or Ag, induced Ab2 and Ab3 (including Abl'). The results suggested but did not prove that the anti-Id antibodies induced were capable of mimicking Ag and could, therefore, elicit Ag-specific responses. To investigate further the Id interactions in this system, mice were injected with the anti-M460 Id mAb, FD51 (representing anti-Id or Ab2) [17] . An induced IgM Ab3 response was detected which was thymus-dependent and idiotypically specific for FD5-1 ( fig. 12a, b) . The serum Ab3 responses and Abl' were detectable only in the IgM isotype; no specific IgG responses were observed. Additionally, injection of mice with FD5-1 induced T celldependent IgM responses against the haptens DNP, NP, and OX ( fig. 13a-f ). When the specificity of serum Ab 1' binding from FD5-1-injected mice was evaluated by antigenic inhibition, binding of serum Abl' to DNP-BSA was inhibitable by DNP-lysine, whereas equivalent concentrations of lysine alone had no inhibitory effect [17] . In agreement with our findings in the M-MuSWM-MuLV system, we have shown that activation of the Id network can be accomplished by injection of either Ab 1 or Ab2. Sera from mice injected with anti-M460 Id mAb (FD5-1) contain antianti-Id antibodies, and the resulting network perturbation generates antigen-specifc antibodies (Ab 1') produced in the absence of Ag exposure. 308 Baskin/Powell/Srinivas/Elliott/Lamon Antigen-Independent Regulation of Immune Responses Antibody-induced modulation of immunity is a novel immunotherapeutic strategy that has the capacity to boost antigen-specific ira-mune responses against virus-induced tumorassociated antigens or virally induced cell surface epitopes associated with infectious disease. Immunization with antibody alone can potentially supersede antigen in the induction 309 of Id \u00a7 antigen-specific responses and circumvents the risks of exposure to infectious agents. The idea of utilizing anti-Id in place of conventional antigen as an alternative vaccine strategy had originally been proposed by Nisonoff and Lamoyi [36] , who noted that antigen and an anti-Id may sometimes share related epitope(s). Subsequent reports also broadened the classification of anti-Id to include Ab2a, 13, 7, etc. [37, 38] in order to describe in detail the juxtapositioning of Ab 1, Ab2, and antigen with regard to idiotope and antigen binding specificities. A great deal of attention has been focused on Ab213, the 'internal-image anti-Id', since these antibodies are proposed to mimic the immunological properties of antigen and have been considered to be the primary candidates for anti-Id vaccines. The 'internal-image' concept may be misleading however, since such terms imply stereochemical identity between anti-Id and nominal antigen. Furthermore, noninternal image Ab2 has been shown to induce antigen-specific responses [39] [40] [41] and thus, participate in functionally significant Id interactions. Recommended use of the term 'network antigens', suggested by K6hler et al. [42] may therefore be a more appropriate way to describe epitopes present on these anti-Id antibodies.",

            "text": "Id-directed T celI interactions that result in antigen-independent generation of Ab2, Ab3, and Abl' can conceivably occur by one (or more) mechanisms. The current paradigm of T cell recognition involves antigen presentation to the T cell receptor by antigen-presenting cells. In the case of CD4+ TH cells, this occurs in the context of major histocompatibility (MHC) class II antigens. Thus, external antigen is presented as a processed peptide in the antigen-presenting groove of a cell surface MHC class II molecule. This configuration allows the joint recognition of antigen and self MHC by the T cell receptor and triggers these TH cells to function as helper cells. Whether such antigen processing and presentation is required for T-dependent Id,--,Id responses is not known. If so, it would involve proteolytic cleavage of the antibody molecule and presentation of the peptide(s) containing the Id in 310 Baskin/Powell/Srinivas/Elliott/Lamon Antigen-Independent Regulation of Immune Responses . 14c ). This might be particularly relevant to T-dependent anti-Id re-sponses when the inducing antibody (Ab 1) is an IgM. IgM FcR have been described on T helper cells [44] and have been implicated functionally as being involved in T cell help in thymus-dependent antibody responses [43] . A final alternative for Fc receptor involvement would be that the inducing antibody could be bound to an antigen-presenting cell by an Fc receptor. Subsequent T cell recognition might involve side by side recognition of Id on the antibody and MHC on the presenting cells ( fig. 14d ). Among these alternatives one would predict syngeneic restriction of T-dependent Id responses for the first and last alternatives but not for the other two. Previous reports have indicated a lack of syngeneic restriction for Tdependent Id responses [45, 46] . Other reports have described a lack of syngeneic restriction for T cell responses induced by a monoclonal anti-T cell antibody (expressing anti-Id) [47, 48] . The exact manner in which these T and B cells interact with one another is still at present unknown.",

Mice injected with Ab2 which recognize a common Id found on antibodies specific for hepatitis B surface Ag (HBsAg) generated antibodies reactive with HBsAg in the absence of antigen [54] . The antibodies induced by injection of the anti-Id, like Abl, expressed an interspecies Id and were able to recognize the groupspecific 'a' determinant of HBsAg [55, 56] . Preimmunization of chimpanzees with Ab2 elicited an Ab3 response which protected the animals from infection after challenge with infectious hepatitis virus [57] . In the reovirus system, a monoclonal antibody specific for the neutralization epitope of type 3 reovirus hemagglutinin was used to generate a syngeneic monoclonal anti-Id in BALB/c mice [10] . Injection of the purified anti-Id, in the absence of viral antigen exposure, elicited an anti-anti-Id (Ab3) response [58] . This Ab3 was specific for the immunizing anti-Id and its Ab I' component was able to bind and neutralize reovirus type 3 preparations. Maternal immunization of mice with anti-Id protected neonates from challenge with a potentially lethal dose of reovirus type 3 (which causes encephalitis). The molecular mimicry of reovirus HA by anti-Id in this system was found to be related to regions of primary amino acid sequence homology observed between the two proteins [59, 60] . In both the rabies and poliovirus systems, immunization with the respective Ab2 led to production of Ab3 which contained virus-neutralizing Ab 1' antibodies [ 11, 61] . However, no protective effect against challenge with a lethal dose of virus was observed in these animals. A protective effect was noted however in members belonging to 9 out of 12 (75%) of the viral families studied which suggests that many of the anti-Ids generated are capable of mimicking viral epitopes or virus-induced antigens in the apparent absence of exposure to nominal antigen. These findings as well as reports of Id network activation in other viral systems are summarized in table 1.",

In agreement with our observations of antibody-induced immune responses to the hapten DNP, and M-MuSV, activation of Id networks against oth-er viral antigens can similarly be achieved resulting in production of Id-and antigen-specific antibodies. These antigen-specific antibodies (termed Ab I') can be frequently shown to be protective against pathogenic challenge  [14, 15, 47, 52, 53, 57, 58, 88, 91, 92, 95] and provide further evidence for the role of Id network activation by antibody alone for immunotherapeutic treatment against virus-induced tumor-associated antigens and viruses associated with infectious disease.

Note: Accessory T cell surface markers not drawn, associated CD4 surface marker not drawn. APC = Antigen-presenting cell. the MHC groove (fig. 14a). However, other mechanisms might be considered. Conceivably, the tertiary configuration of an antibody molecule might be sufficient to present its Id to the appropriate T cell receptor molecule and activate the T cell in the absence of MHC recognition. Anti-T15 Id-specific T cells have been shown capable of binding (or being bound by) antibodies possessing the T15 Id[7]. Thus, in some cases, T cell recognition of Id can occur in the absence of antigen present-ing cells and antibodies can activate T cell responses independent of MHC (fig. 14b). Another alternative for the involvement of T cells might be via IgM or IgG Fc receptors (FcR) on the surface of T cells[43]. Thus, T cells coutd conceivably bind to the Fc of an antibody bound to its complementary Id expressed on a B cell and be activated to function as a helper cell triggering the Id response of the B cell (fig",
