A side-by-side comparison of the HKU4-and MERS-RBD structure, Related to Figure 1 . The secondary-structure elements are labeled. In comparison to MERS-RBD (magenta for the core subdomain and green for the external subdomain), HKU4-RBD (orange for the core subdomain and cyan for the external subdomain) lacks an \u03b1-helix (\u03b11) and two small strands (\u03b22 and \u03b211) in the core subdomain, and is devoid of a 3 10 helix (\u03b74) in the external subdomain. In addition, the helix preceding strand \u03b23 exhibits characteristics of a 3 10 helix (\u03b7') in HKU4-RBD, rather than being \u03b1-helical (\u03b13) as in MERS-RBD. These elements are highlighted by marking with arrows. from the data and the model, respectively. R free is the R factor for a subset (5%) of reflections that was selected prior to refinement calculations and was not included in the refinement. d Ramachandran plots were generated by using the program PROCHECK. The van der Waal (vdw) contacts and H-bond interactions at the HKU4-RBD/hCD26 interface were characterized. The HKU4-RBD residues locating within a 4.5-\u00c5 distance from the receptor were selected and listed in column 1. The number of inter-molecule contacts contributed by, the side-chain and/or main-chain H-bonds observed for and the location of each interface residues were listed in columns 2-4, respectively. \"-\" indicates that no H-bond was observed, and the number of H-bonds contributed by the indicated residues were presented in parentheses. Residues K506 and E541, which afford both side-chain H-bond interactions and multi-vdw contacts, are highlighted.",

The coding sequence for the S protein of BatCoV HKU4 was codon-optimized for mammalian expression, synthesized and sub-cloned into the pCAGGS vector using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites by Generay Biotech Co., Ltd, yielding the construct of pCAGGS-HKU4-S.
