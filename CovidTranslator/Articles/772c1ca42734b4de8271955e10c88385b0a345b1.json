Health care workers were at highest risk of infection. The purpose of this study, which was based on Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB), was to determine the extent to which personal attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control influence nurses' intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients. After the SARS outbreak, a total of 750 staff nurses (response rate 90%) at one hospital completed a questionnaire assessing their intention to provide care to SARS patients. Overall, 42.7% of nurses had a positive intention to provide care to SARS patients, and 25.4% of nurses would volunteer to care for SARS patients. Four factors explaining 35% of the variance in nurses' intention to care for SARS patients were self-efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.39, p < 0.001), attitude (\u03b2 = 0.25, p < 0.001), years of working in the study hospital (\u03b2 = -0.15, p < 0.001), and receiving resources from the hospital (\u03b2 = 0.13, p < 0.001). Two factors explaining 15% of the variance in nurses' volunteering to care for SARS patients were intention (\u03b2 = 0.31, p < 0.001) and attitude (\u03b2 = 0.15, p < 0.001). The final model shows that the variables of the TPB contributed significantly to the explanation of a portion of variance in nurses' intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients. The results are helpful for human resources managers facing a new contagious disease.",

Beginning with the recognition of the first SARS case, the Taiwan Department of Health (DOH) formed a SARS advisory committee and implemented a framework for SARS control, including isolation of suspected and probable SARS patients, use of personal protective equipment for health care workers and visitors, and quarantine of contacts of known SARS patients [3] . During the period from March 14 to April 21, 2003 , only 28 probable SARS cases were reported. In early April, the WHO changed Taiwan's designation from an \"affected area\" to an \"area with limited local transmission\", as a result of Taiwan's success in SARS control during this period. However, on April 22, 2003, the Taiwan DOH was notified of seven cases of SARS among health care workers at a large municipal hospital in Taipei. Beginning in mid-April, unrecognized cases of SARS led to a large nosocomial cluster and subsequent SARS-associated transmission to other hospitals and community settings [2] . In response to the growing SARS epidemic, additional measures were taken to limit nosocomial and community transmission of SARS, including more widespread use of quarantine, building negativepressure isolation rooms, aggressive airport and border surveillance, and intensive infection-control training for health care workers. As of July 9, 2003, a total of 671 probable SARS cases had been reported in Taiwan. After fighting against the SARS epidemic for 4 months, Taiwan was removed from the WHO's list of SARS-affected countries on July 5, 2003 [4] .",

In Taiwan, of the 131,132 persons who were quarantined during the SARS epidemic, health care workers exposed to a SARS patient formed the largest group (133, 0.10%) with suspected or probable SARS diagnosed subsequently [4] . Although nosocomial transmission of SARS was well documented, several infection-control procedures were implemented, and polymerase chain reaction tests were available in Taiwan. The extensive outbreak within health care facilities in Taiwan underscores the urgent need for prompt implementation of, and education of all health care workers in all facilities about, appropriate infection-control procedures.",

It is ethically and professionally unacceptable for health care professionals to refuse to treat or care for a patient with a fatal disease. This is inculcated through hospital practice and training programs throughout the world [7] . However, during the period of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan, probably due to a lack of knowledge regarding SARS transmission, fear of the SARS outbreak, and pressure from family members, or the lack of adequate personal protective equipment provided by hospitals, many physicians and nurses resigned, resulting in a shortage of staff in many hospitals [8] . To increase health professionals' ability and willingness to provide quality care to SARS patients and affirm their ethical duty to care for the sick, it is important for health care administrators to develop and deploy procedures to maximize the safety of frontline nurses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the predictors of nurses' intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients, so that these can be applied to design sequential continuing education programs to improve nurses' confidence in caring for patients in future emerging infectious disease epidemics.",

In health professionals' behaviors, the TPB has successfully predicted health care workers' glove use [11] , nurses' adherence to hand hygiene recommendations [12] , and nurses' intention to assess patients' pain [13] or to administer opioids for pain relief [14] .

By July 9, a total of 67 suspected SARS cases (in-cluding 12 portable cases and 17 fatal cases) had been reported in the study hospital. During the outbreaks, the hospital implemented intensive infection-control procedures to avoid nosocomial transmission of SARS. All staff were instructed to put on gowns, gloves, caps, and masks in a designated area. Goggles and visors were worn during direct patient care, especially for aerosol-generating procedures such as suction or intubations. Hand-washing procedure was strictly enforced for anyone after contact with patients or their body fluids. Fortunately, none of the health care workers at the study hospital were infected with SARS.",

Based on the pilot study and expert opinions, some changes were made to the questionnaire to increase the clarity of the items. All measures used a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), except for the SARS knowledge questionnaire that was measured using a \"yes\" or \"no\" two-point scale. Negative items were reverse scored before the score for each scale was computed. Nurses' attitudes towards caring for SARS patients were measured by their beliefs and evaluation of performing the behavior. There were nine items in the attitude scale.

As hypothesized, the present study supported that the key constructs of Ajzen's TPB contribute to predicting nurses' intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients. Nurses' intention to care for SARS patients was predicted by their attitudes, self-efficacy, and resources.

The study also showed that nurses' positive attitudes contributed significantly to the prediction of nurses' intention to care for SARS patients. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies examining the positive relationship between nurses' attitudes and willingness to care for AIDS patients [16] [17] [18] [19] . In addition, nurses' intention and attitude were predictors of volunteering to care for SARS patients, and intention was the most important predictor, explaining 13% of the variance in nurses' volunteering to care for SARS patients. These findings partially support the TPB. Consistent with the TPB, nurses' intention is deemed to predict their volunteering behavior to care for SARS patients. However, in contrast to the TPB, the direct path from nurses' attitude to their volunteering behavior suggests that intention did not fully mediate the attitude-behavior relationship [11] . Further research is needed to clarify the direct or indirect path among main constructs, intention, and behaviors in the TPB.",

            "text": "Although knowledge is certainly necessary for safe nursing practice in an emergent epidemic, the results showed that SARS-related knowledge did not contribute significantly to either nurses' intention or volunteering to care for SARS patients. The weak association between knowledge and nurses' willingness to care for patients was shown in several AIDS-related studies [16, 17, 20] . In addition, the present study showed that nurses' subjective norms in terms of perceiving their significant others to support their caring for SARS patients was significantly correlated to their intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients. However, in a hierarchical regression analysis, subjective norms was excluded from the regression model after selfefficacy and attitude were added. A possible explanation for this is that nurses' confidence in providing care and positive attitude towards caring for SARS patients weigh higher than the perceived pressure from their family members. The study further investigated the relationship between nurses' age, years of professional experience, and years of working in the study hospital and their intention to care for SARS patients, and found that nurses who are novice, younger, and with less professional experience had a more positive intention to care for SARS patients. These results were consistent with a recent study that investigated 126 hospital nurses' willingness to provide care for SARS patients in six hospitals [8] . During the SARS epidemic, many nurses stayed away from home, fearing that they might spread the disease to their families and friends, and had not disclosed to their families that they had cared for SARS patients. Nurses' concerns about their family's safety were reflected in our findings that nurses who were single or did not live with their family members showed higher intention to care for SARS patients than those who were married or cohabitated with their families. Nurses who were young and novices expressed their empathy towards their colleagues who were married or had children at home, and volunteered to care for SARS patients for their colleagues. This information might help explain why the younger and novice nurses had more positive intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients.",

            "text": "The recent SARS outbreaks have had a tremendous impact not only on the health of the public and health care facilities, but also on health care workers, in particular nurses. Long working hours and close contact with patients increases the risk of infection, which imposes enormous stress on nurses who provide direct care for SARS patients [21] . The study findings add insight for nurse administrators and educators to further develop strategies to increase nurses' intention and volunteering to care for patients with other new and potentially fatal contagious diseases, such as SARS or avian influenza. First, providing sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment, periodically announcing and routinely practicing infection control measures and protocols, and providing up-to-date continuing education for nurses may help to reinforce nurses' self-efficacy in caring for such patients. Second, enhancing positive attitude is much more important than merely increasing nurses' knowledge regarding the disease. Reinforcement of nurses' positive attitudes could be easily achieved by verbal expression of approval and support from nursing administrators, or substantial rewards such as special compensation payments could be used to encourage and acknowledge nurses for their efforts. Third, improving nurses' access to resources provided by hospitals is a key point to increase nurses' intention. Nurse administrators need to ensure that staff nurses obtain sufficient resources and psychologic support, and have the capability and capacity to respond properly to care for SARS patients or any future public emergencies of this kind. Fourth, it is crucial for nursing administrators to serve as nurse advocates to reflect the frontline nurses' voices and concerns in the battle to contain diseases such as SARS, and build up direct communication channels between the hospital administration and staff nurses.",

Regression analysis revealed that knowledge was not a significant predictor of either nurses' intention or volunteering behavior. Furthermore, nurses' intention and attitude predicted their volunteering behavior to care for SARS patients. The study findings provide important insights for hospital administrators, nurse administrators, and educators about factors influencing nurses' intention and behavior of caring for patients with emergent infectious diseases. In general, providing sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment and periodic, up-to-date continuing education, reinforcing nurses' attitudes by verbal approval and substantial rewards, and improving access to resources might help to increase nurses' dedicated commitment to care for SARS patients.",

First, the major weakness of this study was that other important variables influencing nurses' volunteering to care for SARS patients might not be included in the TPB. The factors affecting nurses' volunteering behavior to care for patients with life-threatening diseases seem to be more complex. That is, further studies with qualitative methods may be needed to explore nurses' intention and volunteering behavior to care for SARS patients. Second, the study participants were recruited from one hospital in southern Taiwan and most likely represented a majority of nurses' experience during the SARS epidemic in this hospital. However, the findings may not apply to hospitals outside this geographic area and generalizations of the findings are, thus, limited. ",
