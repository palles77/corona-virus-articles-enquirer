A cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed in 316 infants younger than 2 years of age who were hospitalized for acute viral bronchiolitis. Respiratory tract infection agents were investigated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 316 infants were included in this study. Of the 316 infants, at least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected in 75% (237/316). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common virus identified in 127 infants (40.1%) followed by rhinovirus (n = 78, 24.6%). In this study, where viral agents were determined via PCR in patients who were followed-up due to the diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis, RSV was detected as the most common agent, as in other studies. In almost half of the RSV-positive patients, RSV was accompanied by a second or third agent.",

            "text": "Acute bronchiolitis (AB), which is the most common acute lower respiratory system disease in infants, is often caused by a viral infection. It is especially the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 6 months of age. 1, 2 Epidemic peaks of AB are frequently seen during the winter season. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is usually the cause of 50% to 80% of the cases, but other viruses including adenovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus have also been reported to cause AB as the sole pathogen or as coinfection with or without RSV. 3, 4 With various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, possible new agents like rhinovirus, human metapnomovirus, human bocavirus, Bordatella pertussis, and atypical pathogens were also described as the leading causes of AB. [5] [6] [7] Having a cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, immunodeficiency, and premature birth increase the risk of AB-associated respiratory failure, or even death. 8 The World Health Organization has reported that RSV is the causative pathogen for over 30 million new acute lower respiratory infection episodes in children under 5 years of age and it gives rise to more than 3.4 million hospital admissions and 160 000 deaths every year. 9, 10 The diagnosis of AB is made based on typical history with wheezing and characteristic clinical features such as tachypnea, nasal flaring, chest retractions, and wheezing and/or rales followed by a viral upper respiratory infection in infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2006 11 Chest radiographs and laboratory studies may be thought of on clinical suspicion after evaluating the differential diagnosis for secondary or comorbid bacterial infection, complications, or other conditions. Viral diagnosis methods including antigen detection or immunofluorescence of nasal secretion wash or nasal aspiration, rapid antigen tests, and PCR are only suggested for identifying specific viral agents in children with bronchiolitis if the results will determine discontinuation of palivizumab prophylaxis, initiation or continuation/discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. [12] [13] [14] [15] Majority of studies have recently researched the burden of respiratory viral tract infection agents in AB with larger groups. In these studies, epidemiological, clinical, and risk factors of AB have also been defined. So, it can be said that AB is frequent in infancy and that there is an increase in the number of admissions to hospitals and bronchiolitis-related morbidity.",

Overall, at least one respiratory virus was detected in 75% (237/316) of the cases at Ege University Children's Hospital. The results of the incidence of respiratory viruses in infants hospitalized with AB during the study period are shown in Table 3 . RSV was identified in 127 (40.1%) of the 316 infants hospitalized for AB, and RSV was the most common agent. Of the 127 RSV-positive infants, 76 (59.8%) were sole pathogen for RSV and 51 infants had RSV-coinfection, which was responsible for respiratory tract infection. The second prevalent viral agent was rhinovirus, identified in 78 (24.6%) of the subjects, and as a single pathogen in 35 1%) , and quadruple infections in 1/316 (0.3%) were detected. Of the 81 infants with multiple agents, RSV (51 cases) was the most common virus followed by rhinovirus (n = 43, 53%), influenza virus (n = 18, 22.2%), human metapneumovirus (n = 16, 19.7%), PIV (n = 10, 12.3%), adenovirus (n = 16, 19.7%), human bocavirus (n = 13, 16%), parainfluenza virus (n = 10, 12.3%), and human coronavirus (n = 8, 9.8%). Among dual co-infections, the combination of RSV and rhinovirus had the the highest number (n = 15, 22.3%). The age distribution of infants is shown in Figure 1 for RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and dual infections. In particular, most viral agents were identified in children of all months, whereas RSV was detected in infants aged under 6 months (n = 93/127, 73.2%) and in 15.7% (n = 20/127) of the 127 RSV-positive infants aged under 1 year of age, which was the case in most of our patients. The monthly incidence of bronchiolitis in infants due to common respiratory pathogens is shown in Figure 2 . The majority of the cases were admitted to hospital in the winter time with a peak occurring in January, February, and March; detection rates were also high during these months (26.2%, 25.3%, and 17%, respectively). Other respiratory virus epidemics were seen also during the winter season ( Figure 3 ). Fifteen cases infected with parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus were seen in the summer time.",

In recent years, new human respiratory viruses like human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and new human coronaviruses have also been reported as possible pathogens causing AB. 19 Today, various viral diagnostic tests allow us to examine the epidemiological differences/ clinical characteristics of respiratory viruses and to provide information on their presence. Multiplex PCR has been the most commonly used method due to some significant advantages like permitting simultaneous amplification of several viruses in a single reaction and facilitating cost-effective diagnosis. 20 In this study, we evaluated via multiplex PCR technique the variety and burden of viral agents causing AB in infants under 24 months of age.",

            "text": "The findings are in agreement with the results of several studies previously reported, in which RSV was diagnosed in 50% to 80% of infants admitted to hospital with acute bronchiolitis. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] RSV was the most common virus identified in 127 infants (40.1%) in our study. Stempel et al 26 showed that RSV incidence was 77%, and Antunes et al 27 found this as 58.1% in the RSV epidemic season. In our study, RSV was the most frequently identified respiratory virus, accounting for 40.1% of all respiratory viruses. In addition, 24.6% of the infants in our study were positive for rhinovirus, followed by influenza virus (8.8%), human metapneumovirus (8.5%), adenovirus (7.2%), human bocavirus (6.3%), parainfluenza virus (5.6%), and human coronavirus (3.1%). Human rhinoviruses are the most common human respiratory pathogens and are responsible for most upper respiratory infections (eg, common cold). They may also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. 28 Additionally, human rhinoviruses are known as a major pathogen for asthma exacerbations in children and adults. Recently, some studies have shown rhinoviruses to be the second most commonly seen pathogen for AB. A study conducted in the United States found a prevalence of 25.6% for rhinovirus, 25 similar to our study. However, other studies reported a lower incidence rate of human rhinoviruses in acute bronchiolitis. 24, 29, 30 Our study showed that the respiratory viral agents exhibited seasonal patterns with the number of RSV and rhinovirus cases peaking in the winter season similar to that already published in previous studies. 31 It has been reported that the seasonal distribution of respiratory agents may occur due to meteorological conditions, spreading of infectious pathogens, and pathogen transmission by the host behavior due to different meteorological conditions. 32, 33 Another important theory on pathogen activity is total sunshine exposure. It is hypothesized that ultraviolet light radiation could affect the spread of RSV by inactivating it. 33, 34 The city of Izmir in Turkey, located in the west, has Mediterranean climate in which summers are hot and dry and winters are warm and rainy. This climatic feature could explain the seasonal pattern of respiratory viruses in our study.",
