Cell populations that serve as progenitors within the mature pancreas (mesenchymal stem cells) are being defined. The presence of acinar and ductular structures typical of exocrine pancreas within islet cell tumors is likely the manifestation of maturation of progenitor cells along different pathways of differentiation. Understanding the histogenesis and differentiation of islet cells from mesenchymal stem cell populations has developed new importance in recent years as minimal success is met by efforts to transplant insulin-producing beta cells to cure DM.

During fasting or starvation, autophagic removal of cytoplasmic proteins and decreased production of zymogens reduce the size of the acinar cell. Other features of nutritional exocrine atrophy include loss of apical-basal polarity and vacuolation of the cytoplasm. In contrast, high levels of dietary carbohydrate and protein will result in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the acinar cells. In some animal species, there is seasonal variation of pancreatic morphology.

In addition to serving as a conduit for the transfer of acinar secretory products to the lumen of the duodenum and acting as a barrier between pancreatic parenchyma and its enzyme-rich secretions, the epithelial cells lining the ducts secrete abundant fluid containing bicarbonate and chloride ions. In human beings, epithelial cells lining the ducts may undergo a series of progressively malignant changes that may result in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Briefly, several functionally different populations of endocrine cells in the islet produce and secrete hormones directly into the capillaries that course through the islet. The alpha, beta, delta, gamma (PP), and epsilon cells produce glucagon, insulin and amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide), somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and ghrelin, respectively. Insulin secretion from the islets of Langerhans promotes glucose absorption, lowering blood glucose levels, whereas glucagon has an opposite effect, resulting in elevation of blood glucose levels. Amylin functions to regulate gastric emptying, thus affecting the availability of gastric contents for digestion in the small intestine and affecting the glycemic response. Ghrelin, secreted by epsilon cells of the islet and in the mucosa of the gastric fundus, plays a significant role in the control of appetite, thereby affecting availability of dietary carbohydrate. In the pancreas, pancreatic polypeptide functions to regulate the secretions of pancreatic cells in both endocrine and exocrine compartments. Somatostatin, produced by delta cells and other locations in the digestive system, regulates the release of a variety of hormones, both within the islets and in other organs. Blood flow through the islet and exocrine portions of the pancreas is arranged to sequentially distribute hormones to different environmental niches to coordinate appropriate hormonal control of digestion and metabolism. Immunostaining is used to identify the different populations of endocrine cells ( Figure 6 ).",

Ectopic pancreatic tissue usually consists of well-differentiated acini with ducts, sometimes with interspersed islets. The presence of aberrantly located pancreatic parenchyma is probably due to heteroplastic differentiation of embryonic endoderm or, in the case of pancreatic tissue in the wall of the duodenum, incomplete migration of primordial endodermal cells followed by differentiation to pancreatic cells. Heterotopic pancreatic tissue is theoretically susceptible to a range of pathologies, but reports of such are rare ( Figure 13 ).

The pathogenesis appears to be related to the release of activated digestive enzymes, that is, lipase, from damaged pancreatic tissues, and speculated mechanisms include systemic release of lipolytic enzymes from neoplastic tissue, perhaps through 'leaky' intratumoral blood vessels. Once in the systemic circulation, circulating enzymes are speculated to damage blood vessels, escape into the surrounding tissues, and cause fat necrosis.

Well-defined groups of irregularly or haphazardly arranged cells are present within exocrine lobules. This condition is reported in the veterinary literature occasionally, but usually without clinical signs associated with hyperinsulinemia. Ductuloinsular complexes typical of nesidioblastosis were recently described in a Simmental calf with arthrogryposis. Proliferating beta cells expressed low levels of insulin. Similar lesions composed of proliferating endocrine and exocrine ductular epithelial cells have been reported in dogs. Twenty nine of three hundred and thirty-two dogs in a cohort of young Beagle dogs were reported to contain this change. The condition was most prominent in young dogs.

Recent work has highlighted this condition as previously underdiagnosed in cats. The cause of acute pancreatitis in dogs is not known, but patients with acute pancreatitis are typically older, obese, female, or female-spayed, miniature breed dogs. Dog breeds at increased risk of developing acute pancreatitis include miniature schnauzer, Yorkshire Terrier, and cocker spaniel dogs, but genetic studies to identify specific mechanisms have not been performed. The Labrador retriever dog appears to have a reduced risk of acute pancreatitis. Other risk factors include ingestion of a high-fat meal, endocrine disease (hyperglucocorticoidism or hypothyroidism), hypercalcemia, uremia, trauma, or treatment with the immunosuppressive drug, azathioprine. Damage or disease of the biliary tree or obstructions of the pancreatic duct may cause pancreatitis. Mechanical injury to the pancreas may also incite pancreatitis, especially if there is damage to the ductal system. In small companion animal species, focal iatrogenic pancreatitis may result from biopsy or rough handling during laparotomy, or may be more widespread or regional after more intense trauma such as vehicle impact. The pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is complex and includes the intra-acinar activation of digestive enzymes resulting in degeneration and necrosis of acinar cells, leading to autodigestion of the pancreatic parenchyma and an intense concurrent inflammatory response. Damage to the acinar cells and cells lining the ductules and ducts is usually avoided because digestive enzymes are sequestered in membranebound intracytoplasmic vesicles and are produced as catalytically inactive proenzymes. It appears that events early in the process include the intra-acinar activation of trypsinogen and signaling in support of a local and systemic inflammatory cascade. The trigger for these processes is not known, but a variety of cellular mechanisms are likely involved, including altered calcium signaling, autophagy, and mitochondrial function (Figures 27-30) .",

            "text": "Microscopic changes that support a diagnosis of DM include loss of islets, infiltration of islets by inflammatory cells, and marked cytoplasmic vacuolation of islet cells. Ductular epithelium often has basally located intracytoplasmic vacuoles. In cats and cynomolgus macaques, deposition of amyloid in islets is common. The development of amyloidosis of the islets is almost universal in type 2 DM in human beings and cynomolgus macaques and is also a common finding in wild and domestic felids with this disease. It is, however, also present at a low incidence in some clinically normal cats, so it is not pathognomonic for type 2 DM in cats. The deposition of amyloid occurs due to altered beta-cell function whereby overproduction of amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide) results in the formation of amyloid fibrils. Other aspects of altered beta-cell function are believed to accompany the overproduction of amylin (Figures 40-42) . ",

Beta-cell tumors, 'insulinomas,' are common in ferrets and have been reported occasionally in other animal species.
