For the Rosetta homology model of AQDIYRASYY/HLA-A*01:01, the structural template was the X-ray structure AQDIYRASYY/HLA-B*15:01 as described in the main text. RMSD was determined in PyMOL. RMSD -root mean squared deviation. Heavy atoms -C\u03b1 , CO N and O. Supplementary Figures Supplementary Figure 1. The decamer epitope forms a 3 10 helix structure when bound to HLA-B*15:01.

(Right) The Ramachandran plot showing the \u03c6/\u03c8 angles of each residue of the decamer (A) and nonamer (B) peptide in the binding groove of HLA-B*15:01.The \u03c6/\u03c8 were computed and plotted for each peptide residue using the RAMPAGE server(2). The diagram is divided into favored (dark blue), allowed (light blue), and disallowed (orange) regions. Widening of the HLA-B*15:01 binding groove in the nonamer bound complex relative to the decamer bound complex. (A) and (B) show two angles of a superposition of the nonamer (gray) and decamer (green) bound HLA-B*15:01 X-ray structures fromFigure 3. A widening of 5.1 \u00c5 in the \u03b12 helix near Arg151 is observed (shown with red dotted line). The backbone heavy atom RMSD of the two structures is 0.815 \u00c5. Notably, Arg151 of the decamer complex (dark green and blue sticks) is oriented inwards towards the binding groove, while Arg151 orients away from the binding groove in the nonamer complex (dark gray and blue sticks).SupplementaryFigure 3. Structure-based binding energy calculations of HLA-B*15:01 bound to the self, the nonamer, and the decamer epitopes. Binding energies in Rosetta energy units (R.E.U.) showing that the self-peptides have an unfavorable binding energy compared to either the nonamer or the decamer neoepitopes. This is supported by the loss of favorable interactions with groove residues observed in threaded models of the self-peptide using our HLA-B*15:01 X-ray structure as a template (Supplementary Figure 6A). Similar extended conformations observed for HLA-B*15:01 complexes with different nonamer peptides. X-ray structures showing the binding groove of HLA-B*15:01 complexed with (A) human ALK derived AQDIYRASY nonamer from this study (PDB 5TXS), (B) Epstein-Barr virus derived LEKARGSTY nonamer (PDB 1XR8), (C) human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme-E2 derived ILGPPGSVY nonamer (PDB ID 1XR9), and (D) SARS coronavirus derived VQQESSFVM nonamer (PDB ID 3C9N).

(G) Kullback-Leibler sequence logo for the peptide motif (with respect to binding to HLA-B*15:01) showing preferred and tolerated amino acids for each position where position two and nine are the primary anchor positions. Quantitative peptide/HLA B*15:01 binding data obtained from the IEDB database were used to generate the sequence logo using Seq2Logo (5). Supplementary Figure 5. Comparison of peptide-MHC interactions observed in the nonamer and decamer X-ray structures. (A) Quantitative comparison of different types of molecular contacts: peptide/MHC (inter-peptide polar), peptide/peptide (intra-peptide polar), peptide/MHC (hydrophobic) observed in our two peptide/HLA-B*15:01 X-ray structures shown in Figure 3. We used a distance cutoff of 3.6 \u00c5 between the nonamer (magenta) or decamer (teal) peptide and the binding groove. A detailed map of peptide residue interactions with different structural regions of the MHC groove (\u03b1 1 -helix, \u03b2-sheet, \u03b1 2 -helix) is further highlighted for the nonamer (B) or the decamer peptide structure (C). Structural modeling of the self-peptide complex with HLA-B*15:01. (A) Structural model of HLA-B*15:01 bound to the self-peptide (ARDIYRASY, green sticks); the placement of the Arg2 sidechain results in unfavorable interactions with Ala24, Met45 and Ser67 of HLA-B*15:01 (light red spheres). (B) The X-ray structure of nonamer (AQDIYRASY, magenta sticks) bound to HLA-B*15:01, used as a modeling template for (A), highlights the smaller sidechain of Gln2 which is well-accommodated in the MHC groove. A hydrogen bond is further detected between Tyr9 of the HLA binding groove and Gln2 (cyan dotted line) in (B), but not with Arg2 in (A). (C) The models underlying self-peptide, nonamer peptide, and decamer peptide association with HLA-B*15:01 reinstates the fact that Arg2 of the self-peptide inhibits it from binding HLA-B*15:01, while the nonamer and decamer peptides both form high affinity complexes with distinct structural features displayed to T cells.

Supplementary Figure 8. Evaluating the HLA binding repertoire of ALK neoepitope nonamer AQDIYRASY using structure-based binding energy calculations. (A) Rosetta binding energies calculated from structure modeling of 2,904 unique HLA alleles from the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database(6), for the ALK neoepitope nonamer (AQDIYRASY) plotted as a function of sequence similarity to the top binding allele, HLA-B*15:107 (black circle). The binding energy of nonamer in our HLA-B*15:01 X-ray structure is shown as a reference (red square). A negative control was performed with a mock HLA allele where all residues in the binding groove were replaced with Ala (polyAla groove, green triangle), which shows high binding energy. The corresponding distribution of the HLA alleles on the binding energy landscape is captured in the density plot shown on the right. Sequence identity scores were calculated using the BLOSUM62 (7) matrix.

MHC residues with polar contacts to the peptide are denoted with a cyan asterisk with corresponding MHC pocket noted.(C) and (D) Threaded structural model of HLA-A*01:01 displaying nonamer peptide. Polar contacts between the MHC groove (gray sticks) and peptide (brown sticks) are shown with cyan dotted lines in the HLA-A*01:01 A-, B-, and D-pockets (C) or C-, E-, and F-pockets (D). The residue index for each interacting MHC residue is denoted with the corresponding number from (B) using subscripts. Peptide residues (non-indexed) are labeled without subscripts.

The presence of the nonamer peptide in the HLA-A*01:01 complex was confirmed by LC-MS.

The presence of the decamer peptide in the HLA-A*01:01 complex was confirmed by LC-MS.
