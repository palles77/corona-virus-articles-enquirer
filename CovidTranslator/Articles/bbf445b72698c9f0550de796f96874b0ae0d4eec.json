First, these approaches are attempts to produce a system that is nonnatural but exhibits some aspect of natural behavior. Second, they derive from the engineering perspective that biology is modular. Modularity is reflected at many of the length scales at which natural systems are present, including individuals in a population, cells in a tissue, and proteins assembled into transcription machinery all the way down to the individual amino acids in a protein chain. It therefore makes sense to map out attempts to create synthetic biology with reference to the point in the natural hierarchy of structure at which alterations cause divergence from nature. 2 The y-axis of the map in Fig. 1 represents the biomolecular and systems hierarchies in natural biology. Starting with basic building blocks-such as the nucleotides, amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids; moving through oligonucleotides and polypeptides, which we term tectons; onto folded, assembled, and functional biomolecules-including nucleic acids, proteins and assemblies thereof-and lipid vesicles; and up to cells, in which these various components are brought together, encapsulated, organized, and orchestrated. The x-axis represents increasing diversity from nature: the idea being that if nonnatural amino acids are incorporated into a protein, the divergence from the natural system would increase as the mutation was passed up the hierarchy.",

            "text": "Several pathways are indicated in the diagram, which correspond to broad areas of synthetic biology. At the highest level of the hierarchy is the genome engineering approach, in which constructed genomes are inserted into host cells. 4 This approach was successfully developed by Venter and colleagues at the J Craig Venter Institute using chemically synthesized fragments of DNA followed by in vivo recombination to produce full-length synthetic chromosomes. The synthetic chromosomes were injected into a host cell which had previously had all genetic material removed. The new DNA took control of the host cell's molecular machinery, causing them to produce progeny which contain only the synthetic chromosomes. 5 The next pathway down, biomolecular engineering, uses the same concept of inserting new function into a host cell at the level of individual biomolecular components or pathways. 6 A key example of work in this area is that of Keasling and colleagues at Berkley on the antimalarial drug artemisinin. 7 In this study, a pathway that creates the drug precursor in plants has been transferred and adapted to function in yeast. The fast growing properties of yeast can then be exploited to produce the drug in far higher quantities at a much lower cost. The critical feature of this approach is that biological pathways are modular and can be cut, transposed, and added to new organisms with a minimal amount of interference with existing pathways. The BioBricks project aims to put this on a sound engineering footing by producing a catalog of genetic building blocks whose properties are well defined and can be plugged into new contexts. 8 The next pathway is that of Biomolecular design, which will be discussed in more detail in the rest of this chapter. Essentially, it applies the same principle as above but at the length scale of individual biomolecules rather than whole pathways.",

Ultimately, protocells might also have the ability to pass on their blueprint for the construction of successive generations. 10, 11 Ideally, though bioinspired, none of these aspects would use natural biomolecules: that is, no DNA/RNA-based information stores or transfers; no carbohydrate-based or similar metabolism; no protein structures, binders, or catalysts; and though this appears to be a less stringent stipulation, no natural lipids as membrane components.",

First, they are easier to work with than b-strands as they are stabilized by local interactions. An isolated b-strand is generally not a stable chain configuration, as there are a great many ''dangling'' hydrogen bonds to be satisfied (see Fig. 2 ). To stabilize the strand, these bonds must be satisfied by another strand and/or other nearby secondary structural element. This property makes the b-sheet a nonlocal secondary structure as many nonadjacent areas of the peptide chain may be involved. These considerations mean that de novo design of all but the simplest b-sheet structures can require a predictive knowledge of the behavior of the entire peptide, something that is not currently possible. However, a single helix can be stable individually, with the hydrogen bond network formed between amino acids that are near to each other in the primary sequence. Specifically, the hydrogen bonds are formed between the carbonyl oxygen of residue i and the amide proton of residue i \u00fe 4.",

Shorter coiled coils offer molecular recognition, bringing together other proteins and hence functions in specifically defined combinations. Examples of biological function within the cell include their use as DNA transcription factors, binding to DNA to either repress or promote gene transcription, and the self-assembly of signaling complexes, including ion channels. 22, 23 Molecular recognition by coiled coils is also used to fuse transported vesicles to their target membranes using, for example, proteins of the SNARE family. 24 The rigidity of the coiled-coil structure allows the use of longer coiled coils as structural components. Often, these coiled coils have defined lengths set by the length of the sequences, as is the case with bacterial cell wall spacers. 25 However, coiled coils also form components of fibrillar assemblies such as the intermediate filaments 26 and spectrin which form two-and three-dimensional scaffolds that support the cell. 27 Finally, coiled coils within the cell are dynamic, both in terms of their ability to responsively mediate other protein-protein interactions but also more directly in the form of motor proteins. The three main classes of cytoskeletal motor proteins, namely, kinesins, myosins, and dyneins, all contain long coiledcoil domains. 23 The function of these coiled coils can be both structural-for example, controlling aspects of the stalks attaching cargo to the motor domains 28 -or functional-for example, in using rearrangements in the coiled-coil structure to achieve motive force. 29 It is clear from the ways in which coiled coils are used in nature that they could provide an extremely useful tool for engineering biology. The following sections explore in more detail the knowledge that has been extracted from natural systems and how this has been used to begin designing new functional components.",

For example, a combination of isoleucine and asparagine at a and leucine at d favors dimer formation; using isoleucine at both a and d positions preferentially creates trimers; and using leucine at a positions and isoleucine at d positions favors the tetramer. 32 Higher order oligomers are also promoted by the inclusion of extra hydrophobic amino acids flanking the core region. The two residues (positions e and g) on either side of the hydrophobic interface tend to be occupied by charged amino acids, allowing a range of ionic interactions both between the helices of the coiled coil and within each helix. 33 Recently, 34 it has been shown that these rules may not be generally applicable outside the context of the specific sequence originally examined (GCN4). One significant variation on these rules is caused by the existence of trigger sequences that are capable of specifying the oligomer state of the coiled coil. 35, 36 These are small pieces of sequence that can fold independently into helical fragments before the oligomerization of the coiled coil occurs. It has recently been shown that, in the case of GCN4, the insertion of trigger sequences specifying oligomeric state may be more important than the use of individual specifying residues in determining the final structure. 37 Overall, the current situation is that caution must still be applied when designed peptides are required to exhibit a specific oligomerization state, and that experimental verification of structure is prudent.",

Recently, progress has been made in analyzing how sequences are related to the helix orientation in coiled coils, and prediction algorithms are improving. 38 The thermodynamic preferences for various combinations of side chains packing into the core have been explored 39 and the design of antiparallel coiled coils is an expanding field. 40 The most frequently occurring coiled coils are dimeric, and many of these find function in the cell as transcription factors. In particular, the basic leucine zipper domain proteins (bZIP) are a large collection of parallel A KIH interaction between two helices, seen from (i) the side and (ii) the top. The hole is shown as a solvent-accessible surface; blue indicates the surface of hydrophobic core residues, and red is a charged lysine in an e' position. The knob is donated by the right-hand helix. A Van der Waals representation of the knob is shown, and it can be seen that there is a very close steric interaction between the knob residue and the hole. (B) The hole comprises residues a', d', e', and a' (from the next helical repeat), corresponding to residues in positions i, i \u00fe 3, i \u00fe 4, and i \u00fe 7, and the knob is formed by residue a. dimeric coiled coils. These proteins are of interest to the design process because they exhibit various levels of specificity: that is to say, many of the sequences bind preferentially to only a few partner sequences in the collection. This specificity is a key property necessary in making designed self-assembly that is modular and not promiscuous. An interactome for bZIP proteins has been mapped out by Keating and colleagues using a microscale protein array technique, in which the interactions of 49 human bZIP proteins and 10 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were measured. 41 This technique involves printing plates with each of the proteins under conditions in which they are expected to be monomeric, and then exposing the plates to fluorescently labeled analogs of each of the proteins. The resulting level of fluorescence retained on the plate is used to calculate the interaction strength (Fig. 6) .",

These algorithms variously use combinations of electrostatic information, empirically determined weighting by sequence, and calculations of structural stability made from atomic resolution models. 42, 43 From these studies and others, it has further been deduced that specificity is achieved through three main methods. First, the use of asparagine at a positions (which also specifies for dimers) is used. The introduction of this polar side chain into the hydrophobic core of the coiled coil is destabilizing, however, this effect can be mitigated by partnering with another asparagine on an opposing helix. This provides a design rule: helices with asparagine will preferentially assemble with other helices possessing asparagine at the same point in the helix.",

The thermodynamic stability of all 100 combinations of peptides was then measured. The first conclusion to be drawn from this work is that the most stable homotypic interactions were for isoleucine, followed by valine, leucine, and asparagine. By looking at the coupling energies using double-mutant cycles, it was also deduced that the heterotypic interaction in which asparagine paired with isoleucine was the most repulsive, and that lysine and arginine paired with isoleucine, valine, or leucine, formed the most attractive set of heterotypic interactions. Vinson's group also investigated the use of charged e and g positions within the same system, again using double-mutant cycles. 46, 47 The amino acids alanine, lysine, arginine, glutamine, and glutamic acid were placed in e and g positions, and the stability of all the combinations of heterodimers was considered. The conclusions were that the interaction in which arginine at e paired with glutamic acid at g was the most stabilizing (with respect to alaninealanine) and also had the highest coupling energy. This interaction was also found to be the least reduced by increased salt concentration, indicating that the charges may be partially buried. Other stabilizing interactions were lysine at e with glutamic acid at g, and the switched e for g versions of these interactions. As is expected, the like charged pairs are destabilizing, with glutamic acid paired with itself being the least stable, followed by argininearginine, lysine-arginine, and lysine-lysine pairs.",

The idea is that a synthetic peptide that could outcompete either half of this interaction would be useful as a drug.

Following on from this, they produced two variants of this system, one with an all leucine core and the other with an all hexafluoroleucine core. 59 These two peptides were shown to be mutually exclusive in their self-assembly, with only homodimers forming from mixed solutions.

The two brace peptides were distinguished by one of them possessing an asparagine at a that matched with an asparagine at a in one half of the belt. The external ends of the peptide braces were functionalized with cysteine to enable interactions with gold. The success of the design was demonstrated by a combination of biophysical techniques and by incubation with gold nanoparticles (Fig. 12) . In the absence of the belt peptide, the gold particles are not seen to assemble by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); however, once the belt is added, the nanoparticles collect together in groups spaced by the expected 6-nm length of the belt peptide. This concept was extended by the Woolfson group using the set of six helices discussed previously. 50 In this case, two sets of two peptides were linked together using flexible glycine residues to create two different belt peptides. By combining the two belt peptides, which assembled in an offset manner, with the remaining two of the six peptides, a 9-nm long construct with four components was formed. Again, this assembly was demonstrated through biophysical techniques. While this increase in the complexity of the constructs seems modest, it opens the way for more complicated nanostructures to be designed in the future.",

For the turn region of the monomeric form, a series of sequences were tested, from the flexible to the more rigid.

Fibers in nature tend to be nucleated; in other words, several monomers must be assembled before a stable growing fiber is formed. This gives the cell spatial and temporal control over the location of fiber growth by disfavoring the spontaneous formation of growing small oligomers in the bulk. Natural fibers are uniform in their width (and sometimes length): that is to say, all fibers formed from the same protein have approximately the same dimensions. This means that physical parameters such as flexibility, persistence length, probability of breakage, and the number of monomers per unit length are controlled. This enables the cell to produce fibers that are fit for purpose and are efficient in their use of protein. Natural fibers are dynamic: they can be switched from assembly to dissociation by changes in chemical potential. Many fibers achieve this property in an active fashion using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis as a method to manipulate the energy landscape; however, others are passively responsive to solvent conditions. Exchange of subunits can usually occur at the free ends of the fiber but can also occur along the length of the fiber. Finally, natural fibers are functional-they possess binding sites on their ends and surfaces that are used to recruit other protein machinery including protein motors.",

They have an extraordinarily hierarchical assembly pathway which results in fibers of a determined width and whose mechanical properties allow large deformations. 26 The assembly of vimentin is a specific, well-studied example of an intermediate filament, 80 in which the first step is association of the parallel dimeric coiled coil (see Fig. 19 ). This leaves non-coiled-coil head and tail domains at either end, which are responsible for the onward assembly of two of these dimers to form a tetrameric species which is antiparallel and sticky-ended (meaning that, while there is a substantial overlap between the dimers, a large fraction of the coiled-coil domains are hanging over either end). Two of these tetramers assemble (via interactions between rod domains) to form an octomer, which can be trapped and examined under specific pH and ionic strength constraints. These octomers will further assemble to form an asymmetric 32-subunit-containing species, 81 which represents the unit-length building block of the filaments. Until this species is formed, elongation of the filament is disfavored. Once the elongation has progressed substantially, one final structural rearrangement occurs in which the fiber condenses to a more compact width. The final mature fibers exhibit exchange both at free ends and also in coiled-coil units along the length of the fiber.",

The original peptide design was found to be helical in structure and to produce long, thickened fibers. 88 In later work, the stability of the fibers was improved by the inclusion of oppositely charged side chains in surface-exposed positions in the coiled coil. 89 For this second iteration of the system, the helices were found to be packed in a helical array with the helix axis parallel to the fiber axis, 90 and a mechanism for fiber formation was determined using a combination of kinetic experiments using TEM, circular dichroism (CD), linear dichroism (LD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 91 The mechanism was found to involve an initial folding in which small oligomers are formed, which are approximately half helical, followed by a nucleation step and by simultaneous thickening and elongation. By adding preformed fiber fragments to fresh peptide solutions (seeding), it was shown that at later times elongation dominates.

The final assembly has been shown to contain 60 monomers in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and regular spherical particles by TEM. The particles have a diameter of around 16 nm and an internal cavity of around 6 nm. Both the internal cavity and the free ends of both the trimeric and pentameric peptides are available for functionalization.",

First, polar growth was shown, in that the added labeled peptide associated preferentially to one end of the fibers. This was demonstrated by adding the peptide labeled with rhodamine followed by a peptide labeled with fluorescein, giving fibers with multicolored tips (see Fig. 24 ). Second, a small level of exchange along the length of the fibers was seen, potentially drawing a parallel with the intermediate filament systems. Finally, within the SAF system, various assembling subunits have been covalently linked together, giving systems that produced fibers with branches, waves, and kinks. 103, 104 It should be noted that, in many of these systems, it is not desirable, necessary, or even tolerated that every peptide in the assembly carries a function, and that in many cases, only a small amount of functional peptide is doped into the assembly.",

The field is now moving on towards more complex, discrete structures and applications. As we move along, we will encounter increasingly the challenges of creating systems in which multiple self-assembling components must interact. While several of the works discussed here have attempted to address the issues surrounding the orthogonality of tectons for mixed selfassembling systems, to date our success in producing applications using this information has been limited to small proofs of concept. As we move beyond this, we can expect to encounter greater difficulty in maintaining fidelity of interactions-which should in itself provide another rich source of basic research into the way in which natural systems behave.",
