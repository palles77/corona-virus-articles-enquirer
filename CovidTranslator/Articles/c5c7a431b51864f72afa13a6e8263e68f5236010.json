Using data on local transmissions until the 23rd of March 2020, we develop an ensemble of 200 ecological niche models to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of SARS--CoV--2 throughout a typical climatological year. Although cases of COVID--19 are reported all over the world, most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cool and dry areas. The predecessor SARS--CoV--1 was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV--2 continue to follow current trends, asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks could be expected. According to the models, temperate warm and cold climates are more favorable to spread of the virus, whereas arid and tropical climates are less favorable. However, model uncertainties are still high across much of sub--Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia. While models of epidemic spread utilize human demography and mobility as predictors, climate can also help constrain the virus. This is because the environment can mediate human--to--human transmission of SARS--CoV--2, and unsuitable climates can cause the virus to destabilize quickly, hence reducing its capacity to become epidemic.",

One generalization emerging from more than two hundreds of years of natural history observations is that all organisms have a degree of environmental specialization. That is, while biomes in the planet have a range of different types of organisms(1), individual types of organisms cannot occur in every biome even when, distant apart as they might be, they converge into playing the same ecological roles within ecosystems (2) . Biogeographers and ecologists alike resort to the concept of ecological niche (3--5) to examine the relationship between the distributions of organisms and other biotic or abiotic factors controlling them. An organism is said to be within its ecological niche if death rates of the organism are lower that birth rates (6, 7) . That is, an organism cannot persist beyond its ecological niche, in a sink, unless there is a regular influx of individuals from source populations. Even if the organisms are regularly reaching a sink area, as one might expect with an easily dispersed pathogen, the spread and establishment of the organism will be limited by ecological constraints. Although biogeographic concepts, such as species ecological niches, are commonly used and applied to multicellular organisms (eukaryotes), there is an increased number of studies utilizing the ecological concepts and associated analytical tools to investigate relationships between the distributions of unicellular organisms (prokaryotic), or viruses, and a range of biotic and abiotic environmental factors (8--10) .",

Comparing daily spread of the virus across geographical space versus climatic space reveals stronger aggregation in climate space than in geographical space. That is, while the virus is progressively colonizing most parts of the world, thus being geographically widespread, local infections were still prevalent within a relatively narrow set of environmental conditions ( Figure 2 ). The uneven colonization of geographic versus climatic space, invites the interpretation that climate is acting as a stronger constraint for the spread of the virus than geographical distances are. Most local transmissions occur in regions exposed to cool and dry conditions-measured both through evapotranspiration and precipitation-, and near the lower end of the radiation gradient (but rho with temperature = 0.78).",

These values are estimated taking into account total numbers of positive cases (i.e., abundance), which are obviously strongly determined by contingent factors linked with the origin of the SARS--CoV--2 Coronavirus outbreak (the city of Wuhan in China) and subsequent pattern of spread. While the pattern of spread is likely to be partly constrained by climate, the actual numbers of positive cases are affected by non-climatic factors too (15) , some of which might be stochastic. Less sensitive measurements can be obtained by using the presence and absence of positive cases. With such an approach, the mean and estimated interquartile ranges for temperature are 9,14\u00baC (mean) and --11,43\u00baC to 27,15\u00baC (95% range), and for radiation they are 154,57 W/m\u00b2 (mean) and 54,31 W/m\u00b2 and 255,43 W/m\u00b2 (95 range).

While improvements in the data and the models can reduce uncertainties, an issue we are now exploring at light of the recently published standards for applied ENMs (18) , characterizing the uncertainty of existing models is a first step towards understanding the limitations of projections and highlighting areas of concern. We generated 200 models by varying the initial conditions and model classes. As such, we were able to quantify and map some of the methodological uncertainties associated with projections ( Figure 5 ). Using this approach, we show that variation associated with changing initial conditions is negligible, which is unsurprising given that splits are randomly performed. In contrast, consistently with previous studies addressing climate change forecasts (19) , uncertainty associated with use of different modeling techniques is high (20, 21) .

In contrast, inter--model variability across northern higher latitudes is lower and this is likely because most records between January and March are found there. Such areas of low inter--model variability coincide with areas where seasonal variation is also greater. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Previous analyses of SARS--CoV--1 outbreaks in relation to meteorology also revealed significant correlations between the incidence of positive cases and aspects of the weather. For example, an initial investigation linking SARS outbreaks and temperature in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan (26) , revealed significant correlations between SARS--CoV--1 incidences and temperature seven days (the known period of incubation of SARS--CoV--1) before the outbreak, with environmental temperatures associated with positive cases of SARS--CoV--1 ranging between 16\u00baC to 28\u00baC. They also found that incidence of the Coronavirus was inversely related to humidity. Another study conducted between 11 March and 22 May 2003 in Hong Kong (27) showed that SARS--CoV--1 incidences sharply decreased as temperature increased from 15\u00baC to 29\u00baC, after which it practically disappeared.

We used a 5--fold cross--validation(52), repeated 4 times, resulting in 20 replications per method. We then fitted ecological niche models for each replication using the four random cross--validation splits as training set and evaluated them against the fifth withheld data split. We used the area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot and the true skill statistic (TSS) to measure the predictive performance of models (53) . A ROC curve plots sensitivity values (true positive fraction) on the y-axis against '1 -specificity' values (false positive fraction) for all thresholds on the x--axis. AUC is a threshold--independent metric that varies from 0 to 1 and provides a single measure of model performance. AUC values under 0.5 indicate discrimination worse than expected by chance; a score of 0.5 implies random predictive discrimination; and a score of 1 indicates perfect discrimination. TSS is calculated as \"sensitivity + specificity --1\" and ranges from --1 to +1, where +1 indicates perfect agreement, a value of 0 implies agreement expected by chance, and a value of less than 0 indicates agreement lower than expected by chance. We then used the ensemble of 200 models to calculate and project a consensus distribution of climate suitability for the spread of SARS--CoV--2, for each month, across the globe. Consensus was achieved through AUC--weighted mean across all models (21) . The assessments of model performance on cross--validated samples are reported in Supplementary Figure S3 . Predictor variables importance Variable importance (54) and response curves (55) were estimated to infer the explanatory power and shape of the relationship for each one of the predictor variables used and the distribution of positive cases of SARS--CoV--2. Response curves are generated with the evaluation strip procedure (55) , implemented in sdm--R (11) . For each climate variable, the method generates the predicted probability of occurrence over all values in the gradient of the climate variable while the other climate variables are kept at their mean values. Then, visualizing the predicted values against the climate gradient represents the response of the species to the climate variable. Additional model--independent techniques were also implemented to evaluate the relative variable importance. We assessed the relative contribution of variables to explain the distributions of positive cases of SARS--CoV--2 in models using the variable importance (VI) analysis in sdm--R (11) . This method is a randomization procedure that measures the correlation between the predicted values of a model given the original predictors, and predictions of the same model but given the perturbed dataset in which the variable under investigation is randomly permutated. If the contribution of a variable to the model is high, then it is expected that the permutation would affect the prediction, and consequently, the correlation is low. Using this approach, '1 -correlation' is considered as a measure of variable importance (56) .

This method quantifies the correlation between the predicted values and predictions where the variable under investigation is randomly permutated (11) . If the contribution of a variable to an SDM is high, then the permutation would affect the prediction values, and consequently, the correlation coefficient would be low. Therefore, '1 -correlation' can be considered as a measure of variable importance. Decomposition of sources of variation We used a 3--way ANOVA to decompose variation in model projections from the 10 different modeling techniques used and 20 replications of the initial conditions (data on SARS--CoV--2 cases). We compared variation arising from data and models with variation associated with projected seasonal changes in climate suitability. The latter is the desired projection, rather than a methodological uncertainty. However, comparison of seasonal projected variation in climate suitability with variation arising from different partitions of data and model classes provides a benchmark against which to compare model variability. If data and model variability was greater than projected seasonal variability, then reliance on the models could be questioned. The analysis involved running a three--way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) without replication(57, 58) for each cell, using climate suitability for SARS--CoV--2 as response variable and ecological niche models (ENM), bootstrapped samples (BS), and months (M) as factors. We then obtained the sum of squares to each of these sources and their interaction (ENM x BS, ENM x M, BS x M, ENM x BS x M). We estimated the variance components as the proportions of the sums of squares for the three sources of variation (and their interaction) with regards to the total sum of squares (20) . Analyses were performed for each cell in the world grid and we mapped each variance component separately (interaction term was not significant, hence not reported). Monthly variation in climate suitability is the expected outcome of the models. Variability associated with ENM and BS is expected to represent the variability associated with changing initial conditions (BS) and model classes (ENM). They are interpreted as uncertainty estimates and should ideally be much proportionally smaller than monthly variation.",

            "text": "Seasonal variation in climate is ubiquitous and it can exert strong pressures on spatial and temporal dynamics of viruses(8). Of course, not all viruses are climate determined. HIV/AIDS, for example, is not affected by external climatic factors. The virus is transmitted by sexual intercourse, blood transfusions, or from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding, so it never leaves the host's internal environmental conditions. In contrast, SARS--CoV--2, like other respiratory viruses, namely its predecessor SARS--CoV--1, involves aerialtransmissions of respiratory droplets or fomites, exposing the virus to external environmental conditions in which transmissions take place. SARS--CoV--2 has already set foot in most parts of the world, but virulent outbreaks of COVID--19, with large numbers of local infections, are still clustered in areas with relatively well--defined climate conditions (Figure 2). Starting in Wuhan, China(22), the virus quickly became epidemic in several parts of the northern hemisphere, chiefly China, the Middle East, Europe, and the USA. Arguably, being China well connected to the World, the virus would have had equal probability to spread and become epidemic everywhere. But this is not what data show. The pattern of spread, far from being random, was tightly associated with the climate conditions of the temperate and arid zones during the winter. Even the USA that imposed an early ban on flights from China faced an escalation of cases of COVID--19 by the end of March. Our models fitted on the existing pattern of spread between January and March 2020, support the view that incidence of the virus could follow a seasonal climate pattern with outbreaks generally being favored by cool and dry weather, while being slowed",

A recent observational study conducted across 100 cities in China also found that high temperatures and high relative humidity was significantly associated with reductions in reports of COVID--19 cases(32). They found their results to be maintained after controlling for population density and GDP (gross domestic product), concluding that the arrival of the summer and rainy season in the northern hemisphere could help reduce the spread of SARS--CoV--2. Another study examined transmission rates of SARS--CoV--2 in the Hubei Province against measurements of absolute humidity(33). They found no support for the hypothesis that high humidity would limit survival and transmission of the virus, but the interaction of temperature and humidity on SARS--CoV--2 was not examined. As the virus spreads and additional climate regions witness outbreaks of COVID--19, it is possible that the climate signal might be weakened or even lost. This could happen as consequence of varying approaches to the management of the epidemics across political units: for example, whether a country choses mitigation versus suppression should effect height and width of the epidemic curve(34), hence the frequency distribution of COVID--19 cases in space and time. Likewise, measured relationships between outbreaks of COVID--19 and climate could be contaminated by data with substantially different quality, as it might be the case when comparing regions spending vast amounts of resources in testing for cases and regions practically not any conducting any tests. Countries like Brazil, for example, where a combination of high human population density and",

Indoor transmissions, under acclimatized environments, can be predominant in certain cultures. That infected humans can be asymptomatic and transmit the virus to other humans, generates substantial uncertainties regarding the overall risk of epidemic outbreak of COVID--19 under a variety of different ecological and social settings(37). In China, for example, indoor transmissions were estimated to account for nearly 80% of the total transmissions but this value is likely to change in in cultural and socio--economic contexts. Unfortunately, data regarding the context in which transmissions take place are not readily available. Understanding the underlying factors involved in the successful spread of SARS--CoV--2 is critical to manage the timing and scale of the social, economic, and political reactions to it. Our results are qualitatively similar with those of two other independent large--scale investigations of the relationship of COVOD--19",
