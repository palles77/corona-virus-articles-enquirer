PCR assays performed retrospectively on specimens from patients with positive serologic results for M. pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp were negative for those organisms.

Hundreds of persons were evaluated by local counties before being reported to CDHS, where they were classified as having suspect or probable SARS. Of these patients, more than one-third had a pathogen detected that was considered a likely cause of their condition based on their clinical features and course of illness. Twenty-one (81%) of these pathogens were identified by RT-PCR within an average of 4 days. In California, determining a commonly recognized cause for an influenzalike illness allowed cases to be removed from the suspect or probable SARS categories. The resultant removal of a SARS designation alleviated the required epidemiologic investigation, hospitalization or isolation, strict infection control precautions, and additional specimen collection and contact tracing.",

Most case reports of laboratory-confirmed SARS are noteworthy for the lack of other viral agents (11, 14, 15) . Accordingly, SARS can be ruled out when common culprit viral pathogens are detected in areas without known community transmission of SARS. However, several factors should be considered before discontinuing further evaluation for possible SARS when a likely alternative cause has been identified, including the following: 1) the strength of the epidemiologic link to SARS, 2) specificity of the diagnostic testing performed, and 3) the clinical features and course of illness for the alternative diagnosis. Should SARS become reestablished, these exclusion criteria may need to be reevaluated and applied with particular caution in patients with strong epidemiologic exposure in the context of community transmission.",

            "text": "Applying molecular techniques to outbreak investigations is a relatively recent approach. The limitations of molecular testing include the possibility of false-positive results caused by specimen contamination during processing and false-negative results from primer mismatch or inhibitors in the specimen. Ideally, in the diagnostic setting, positive results by molecular techniques should be confirmed by either testing another specimen by the same method or the same specimen by another method, such as immunoassays or culture. Also, detecting an agent by PCR does not always indicate the true cause of infection; it may instead signify nasopharyngeal carriage or simply be an \"innocent bystander.\" Nevertheless, given the nonspecific initial signs and symptoms of patients with SARS, the capacity to rapidly diagnose common respiratory infections by using sensitive PCR methods offers advantages in the context of a respiratory outbreak. We found that applying a broad diagnostic molecular panel during the SARS outbreak enabled timely identification of agents of common respiratory viral infections in more than one third of patients with suspect or probable SARS cases. Although serologic testing aided identification of selected atypical pathogens, the requirement for paired serum specimens did not allow timely removal of a SARS designation. Even when a rapid and definitive diagnostic test for SARS becomes available, laboratories capable of performing molecular-based diagnostic testing, especially for influenza, should be maintained and strengthened.",
