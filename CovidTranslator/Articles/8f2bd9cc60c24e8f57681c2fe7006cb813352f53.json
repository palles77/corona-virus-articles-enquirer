Driven by consumptive use for food and traditional medicine, the large volume of both legal and illegal trade in wildlife has caused great destruction to ecosystems and pushed many species to the brink of extinction. Data gathered from trading hubs at ports, boundary markets, city markets and stores, indicates the large amount of wildlife traded in the region of Guangxi, Yunnan and Qinghai provinces, a direct result of the numerous wildlife markets available. In a survey distributed in various trading places, while about half of the respondents agreed that wildlife should be protected, 60% of them had consumed wildlife at some point in the last 2 years. The results also indicated that law and regulation on wildlife trade control is insufficient. Wildlife trade controls are very limited because of bias on the utilization of wildlife as a natural resource to be exploited by the government agencies. The survey also shows that the current situation of wildlife consumption in key cities in China is serious, especially the consumption for food. The main consumption groups in China are male and young people with high education levels and good incomes. The key in public awareness publicity and education is to give them more information on the negative impacts of wildlife consumption and knowledge of protection.",

The markets for consumption are increasing, and using wild animals as pets, for medicine and health care, and as food has become a status symbol and a fashionable lifestyle pursued by many (Zhou 1997; Morgan 2000; Wang et al. 2001a; Nooren and Claridge 2001) . This robust market demand means lucrative profits for traders, providing a strong incentive for more people to join the trade. As a result, wild animal trade has expanded quickly, and illegal wild animal trafficking has increased sharply. Trafficking, which involves excessive capture and non-sustainable utilization of wild species, poses a severe threat to many endangered species (Li et al. 1996; Li and Li 1997) . Large quantities of wild animals are now on the verge of extinction as a result of commercial development, such as Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) and tiger (Panthera tigris) (TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004; S. Wu 2007, private communication; Dinerstein et al. 2007) . As a conservative estimate, tens of millions of wild animals are shipped each year regionally and internationally destined to southern China for food or East and Southeast Asia for use in traditional medicine (WWF 2001) . According to the third annual report released by the Biodiversity Working Group of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (BWG/CCICED), nearly 70% of mammal species in China are endangered because of hunting and habitat destruction, with the primary threat being excessive hunting (BWG/CCICED 1999) . In the report entitled ''Wildlife Trade in Southern China'' released in 1995, the BWG pointed out that the increase in wildlife trade on Mainland China in recent years could be attributed to four main of causes:",

Adding to the problem, wild animal trade monitoring is very weak in China, making it difficult to assess the impact on wild animals domestically; relevant data obtained from consumers are also very scarce. Meanwhile, the coexistence of legal trade and illegal trade makes it very difficult to monitor wild animal trade and distinguish which products are entering the market legally and which are being smuggled in illegally (Li and Zhang 2003) . Identifying animal species traded at the sales terminals, estimating trading frequency, identifying species under protection or rare species, and assembling data on the countries and routes involved in trafficking are complex tasks that require support from a wide variety of sources (Mill et al. 1995; Zhou 1997; Xie 1999; Wan 2004) .",

In addition, limited data on wildlife trade are not efficiently shared and utilized between relevant protection and decision-making departments. Another alarming trend is that the cross border trade in mammals, birds and reptiles between China and neighboring countries has reached a level previously unmatched in history, substantially affecting wildlife populations (Li et al. 1996; Yang et al. 2000; Nooren and Claridge 2001; Wang et al. 2001a, b; Lee et al. 2004) . As a result, we are working to establish a database and monitoring platform on wildlife trade which can be used to enhance the communication among government administrative departments, decision-making departments and related organizations, improve monitoring and evaluation methods, strengthen law enforcement, and advance management and control on wildlife trade. The aim of this project is to eliminate commercial exploitation of animals by creating a sound public and democratic environment for the public to voice their opinions on wildlife consumption and protection issues.",

Poaching and smuggling in Qinghai and Tibet is also a serious problem. Local residents heavily depend on natural resources for their livelihood, but lack awareness of the need to protect these resources.

Unlike Guangdong, Yunnan has more convenient road transportation and longer shared borders with neighboring countries. This means that many smugglers prefer to trade along the borders, instead of through Customs, making it even harder to regulate and monitor the illegal trade. Legal wildlife trade in Yunnan mainly comes from river ports in eastern Yunnan. Guangxi benefits immensely from wildlife trade. As wildlife in Guangdong is expensive in comparison to other regions, most of the imported wildlife in Guangxi (about 85%) is traded to Guangdong and the rest goes to Nanning, then Liuzhou. Qinghai is rich in wildlife resources, so most of the wildlife traded there is sold locally or to nearby provinces (Fig. 2 ).",

Those who consume wildlife regularly are the largest group, accounting for 31.1% of the total. What is more worrying is that 57.5% of residents who consume wildlife voluntarily started to buy wild animals due to word of mouth, media or the influence of professionals. In the analysis of different groups' attitudes towards wild animal consumption, we find that a high percentage of those who have never consumed wild animals hold the ''utilization value theory,'' and the percentage of those holding ''vague cognition'' is even higher among those who have never consumed wild animals than among wild animal consumers. Given that Chinese urban residents' wild animal consumption is affected to a great extent by community views and pressure, in the future it is possible that more people will begin wild animal consumption due to societal influences. Considering the current situation, intervening now, before more people become wild animal consumers, is very important, as changing consumer behavior once it has begun is much more difficult.",

Consumer attitude is subject to various factors, and cognitive level does not play a decisive role People's attitudes influence their behavior. In this survey, we found that only 42.7% of Chinese urban residents think no wild animals should be consumed. Consumer attitude is subject to various factors, and cognitive level does not play a decisive role. First we examined people's views regarding the scope of wild animals that should be protected. Those who hold the view that ''all wild animals should be protected,'' were more likely to not be supportive of animal consumption. This would indicate that to some extent people's attitude toward wild animal consumption is directly proportional to their cognitive level. Second, through a comparative study on consumer attitude of groups with different demographic background, we find that well educated groups have high cognitive level of wild animal protection. Yet people's attitude towards wild animal consumption is not directly proportional to their educational level. Among groups with different educational background, the percentage of those who could correctly identify the listed protected species is the highest among two-year college graduates, followed by high school and junior high school graduates. However, those who are not necessarily in disagreement with wildlife consumption are more likely to hold at least a bachelor's degree, and likewise the percentage of those following the ''utilization value theory'' is higher among those with bachelor's degree or above (55.8%) than among those with less formal education.",

Third, there is marked difference between groups with different consumption levels and their motives for consumption. For example, the behavior of eating wild animals: a greater proportion of heavy consumers (58.7%) eat wild animals because they find them delicious. The percentage of those holding the utilization value theory is much higher among heavy consumers than among the other two groups. On the other hand, a higher percentage of light consumers tried wild animals out of curiosity.

When looking at consumer behavior, consumption degrees, consumption channels and consumption motives, different cities have different consumption features. For example, the behavior associated with eating wild animals: a high percentage of residents in Shanghai and Guangzhou eat wild animals at popular restaurants and purchase wild animals from markets to cook at home, and the percentage of heavy and medium consumers in Guangzhou is higher among residents in these two cities than in other cities (the percentage of heavy consumers in Guangzhou is second only to that in Beijing). For consumption motives, taste and nourishment are the two primary motives for eating wild animals among residents in Shanghai and Guangzhou. This indicates that eating wild animals has become a habitual consumption behavior among residents in Shanghai and Guangzhou. Among the five cities, the percentage of residents in Beijing who eat wild animals at high-end restaurants and hotels is highest, as is the percentage of heavy consumer and light consumer residents. Most people consume wild animals out of curiosity, with the idea that wild animals are rare. For initial consumption motives, a major percentage of people involuntarily started wild animal consumption (i.e. it was given to them by friends, family, or colleagues). This indicates that wild animal consumption has become part of the lifestyle of some high-income people in Beijing; it also indicates the influence of peers and group pressure on consumer behavior and consumption methods. It is possible that without effective control and intervention, many consumers will become medium and heavy consumers. According to the current trend, Beijing is likely to become a swing consumer city.",

Sudden threats of disasters like a widespread disease certainly affect people's lifestyle and behaviors quickly, but it is not feasible to expect such temporary impact to fundamentally change the deep-rooted motives and notions formed by long-term social customs and traditions. In this study, we find that merely educating people on the threat posed to their health by wild animal consumption cannot fundamentally change people's attitude towards wild animal consumption. It can only heighten, to a certain extent, people's hostility toward wild animals, and cannot engender a conservation-oriented view towards wild animals. In comparing residents in different cities in terms of their understanding of wild animal protection, we find that the percentage of Guangzhou residents, who were the first to receive the impact of SARS, hold the ''threat theory'' at the highest; while their cognitive level about protected wild animals is the lowest. Among the four groups divided by the viewpoints regarding the scope of wild animals that should be protected, the percentage of those holding the ''utilization value theory'' of consumption is comparable to those holding the ''threat theory'' and the ''utilization value theory.'' In other words, the view that wild animals may spread diseases to human beings or pose a threat to their lives does not reduce peoples' propensity to utilize or consume wild animals. Therefore, in conducting behavior intervention we not only need to consider differences between consumer groups in cognition, attitude and behavioral features, but, more importantly, various measures should be taken to produce changes in human behavior.",

A high percentage of people aged 56-60 and 18-25 do not like it. The percentage of those who think it is not right to consume wild animals is far lower among people with primary school education and below than among other groups. A high percentage of junior high school and high school graduates think it unhealthy, while a high percentage of those with bachelor's degree or above do not like to consume wild animals for different reasons. This indicates that we may guide the audiences by cultivating healthy consumption notions using various approaches in a short time. For example, we may educate young people not to eat wild animals and encourage them to abstain from wild animals early on. Meanwhile, we may imbue middle-aged people and those with low education with the view that wild animal consumption is not healthy.

Eighteen of these species are Category I of China's State Key Protected Wildlife List; 30 are in Category II of China's State Key Protected Wildlife List; 59 of them are CITES-listed (17 from Appendix I, 37 from Appendix II and 5 from Appendix III). There are 41 species listed in both China's State Key Protected Wildlife List and CITES Appendix. Many of the animals traded were Chinese species or wide-ranging East Asian species. However, in the food and pet trade, a large proportion of animals were imported from other countries. 3. Trading amounts. According to records from Yunnan Customs, 6,274.8 kgs of turtles and snakes, 100 crocodiles and 1,372.5 tons of wild plants were imported between 2000 and 2004. In recent years, illegal wildlife trade has grown rapidly, especially along the border between China and Vietnam. For example, from 1999 to 2004 Hekou (Guangxi Province) Customs seized more than 600 Slow Loris, 50,000 snakes, 3,000 Asian Water Monitors and 2,500 Tokay Geckos. From 1998 to 2004, Wanding (Yunnan Province) Customs seized a total of 19 kgs of tiger bone, 5 kgs of leopard bone, 70 turtles, 12 pangolins, and 2 Green Peacocks. Mengla (Yunnan Province) Customs seized 36 bear paws, 162 kgs of Big-headed Terrapin, and 12 tons of Thailand Soft-shelled Turtle between 2000 and 2002. Yunnan forestry police also confiscated large amounts of wildlife being illegally trafficked.
