Here we create a tool based on a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to model the interaction between biosecurity practices and the probability of occurrence of four different diseases on Canadian swine farms. The benefits of using this novel approach, in comparison to other methods, is that it enables us to explore both the complex interaction and the relative importance of biosecurity practices on the probability of disease occurrence.",

We used expert judgement to identify 15 biosecurity practices that were considered the most important in mitigating disease occurrence on farms. These included: proximity to other livestock holdings, the health status of purchased stock, manure disposal methods, as well as the procedures for admitting vehicles and staff. Four diseases were included in the BBN: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), (a prevalent endemic aerosol pathogen), Swine influenza (SI) (a viral respiratory aerosol pathogen), Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) (an endemic respiratory disease spread by close contact and aerosol) and Swine dysentery (SD) (an enteric disease which is re-emerging in North America).",

Increased probability of PRRS and of MP were associated with spilt feed (feed that did not fall directly in a feeding trough), not being disposed of immediately and with manure being brought onto the farm premises and spread on land adjacent to the pigs. Increased probabilities of SI and SD were associated with the farm allowing access to visiting vehicles without cleaning or disinfection. SD was also more likely to occur when the health status of purchased stock was not known. Finally, we discuss how such a model can be used by the Canadian swine industry to quantify disease risks and to determine practices that may reduce the probability of disease occurrence.",

In Canada, not enough money, time, and effort have been invested in identifying and quantifying transmission risks for important swine pathogens (Desrosiers, 2011) . Lack of understanding of potential Here we create a tool, known as a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), which can be used to identify and quantify the probability of disease occurrence in Canadian swine farms. A BBN is a probabilistic graphical model which represents a network of nodes connected by directed links that represent a probability function (Jensen, 2001) . BBN models allow users to make informed decisions about a range of possible outcomes using information based on prior evidence (Fenton and Neil, 2013) . BBNs have previously been used in the veterinary domain, for example, to aid disease diagnosis (McKendrick et al., 2000; Seidel et al., 2003; Otto and Kristensen, 2004) and to assess associations between biosecurity practices and disease outbreak (Firestone et al., 2014) . These studies focused on one specific disease, and BBNs have not, to our knowledge, been used to assess the relative impact of biosecurity practices simultaneously on a group of diseases.",

We chose to design a BBN in this context for two reasons. First BBNs provide a method of consolidating evidence in a consistent and mathematically robust manner. Unlike more traditional methods of data analysis, they can incorporate a large number of predictors and a number of interactions (Fenton and Neil, 2013) . They can therefore be used to investigate causal relations between events, weigh the consequences of actions and identify unintended side effects. Here we highlight the utility of a BBN, in particular how one might be used to assess on-farm scenarios and to determine the trade-offs that must be made during decision making on any farm operation. Second, an innovative feature of BBNs is that they do not require precise probabilities to calculate the outcome and can provide good results even when only approximate probabilities are available (Ben-Gal, 2007) . This is an advantage to the swine industry where precise prior information about emerging disease events is often not available and because stakeholder opinions (e.g. producers, veterinarians and allied industry personnel) can vary widely (Marvin et al., 2010) .",

Thus the expert elicitation followed a Delphi style approach, where weights were assigned and later agreed upon as a group (O'Hagan et al., 2006) . This process occurred at the time of the biosecurity survey (before our work began) and we therefore had no input about the method of expert elicitation.

The questionnaire was emailed by CSHB researchers to all veterinarians (n = 40) who completed the biosecurity survey for the 218 farms. The veterinarians were invited to complete the survey for each farm within 2 weeks. One reminder email was sent to nonresponders after 2-3 weeks. Vets were instructed that they would receive a payment of $100 for participation. Farm identification and precise location of the farm was only known by the veteri- narians and was not disclosed to the authors. Disease reporting was considered to be accurate because the veterinarians were able to consult their records that they made at the time of diagnosis. Data about farm biosecurity practices and disease status were collated in one database. The farm identification number allowed us to match anonymously the disease information from our survey with the biosecurity information on that farm.",

It is represented as a directed acyclic graph, in which nodes (representing variables) are connected by arrows that represent directed causal relations. Each node, which has a number of states, contains a conditional probability table (CPT), which specifies the conditional probability of the node being in a specific state given the state of its parent nodes. For example, the BBN built here represents the relationship between diseases and biosecurity practices. Given specific biosecurity practices, the BBN uses Bayes' rule to calculate posterior probabilities of disease occurrence. Thus the term 'Bayesian' in BBN refers to the prominent role of Bayes' rule of probability. Detailed description of Bayesian networks is provided in Jensen (2001) and Fenton and Neil (2013) .",

First, the direction allows us to specify a CPT for each biosecurity node, which is conditional on disease (rather than specify an unconditional probability table for each biosecurity node).

In contrast if we sample biosecurity practices, it will be more difficult to then count how many farms become infected with a disease.

In contrast, we received information from 95% of the 20 farms in BC and so the disease prevalence data are heavily skewed by these inputs. We decided to re-assess the model by excluding the region node. We now use the subscripts BBN +r and BBN \u2212r when region was included or excluded respectively.

Results indicated that farm type influenced the probability of disease, with farrow-to-wean farms most likely to experience disease occurrences. Although we excluded information about region from our model, due to limitations in the data, it is likely that region has a considerable influence on disease occurrence since farm type and management strategies vary between regions. For example, the size of farm changes according to region, with Manitoba, Quebec and Saskatchewan having the largest herds and BC and the Atlantic provinces the smallest (Brisson, 2014) . Unfortunately we were unable consider farm size in our analysis because that data was not available. Differences in management strategies include movement of animals between provinces: Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario export pigs to other provinces for slaughter, while BC, Manitoba and Quebec import animals from other provinces for slaughter (University of Guelph, 2010).",

The virus can be detected in saliva, urine, milk and faeces; routes of indirect transmission include via fomites (boots, overalls, etc.), farm personnel, transport vehicles and insects. Significant risk factors for spread between farms include purchase of animals from herds incubating infection (World Organisation for Animal Health, 2008) and proximity to infected neighbouring herds, particularly because transmission can occur via aerosol (Otake et al., 2010) . Biosecurity protocols to reduce the probability of PRRS include sanitation of vehicles, and implementation of strategies for personnel/fomite entry (World Organisation for Animal Health, 2008), however control programs are frequently unsuccessful at preventing virus introduction (Desrosiers, 2011) . In our BBN \u2212h\u2212r , the greatest risk of PRRS was related to when manure was brought onto the farm and spread on land adjacent to the pigs. Our model also showed that when the distance to neighbouring pig farms was more than 1 km, the probability of PRRS decreased compared to being within 1 km. This is in agreement with studies that have shown that herds located within 1.5 km of a neighbouring pig farm were more likely to be PRRS-positive (Lambert et al., 2010) .

SD incidence in North America was declining following eradication and effective manure removal techniques, however, in 2009 it re-emerged in Western Canada (Harding et al., 2013) and approximately 50% of farms became infected through contaminated pigs. Other specific security breaches are poorly understood, although exposure to contaminated faeces or manure (Harding et al., 2013) and wildlife (Desrosiers, 2011; Harding et al., 2013) are likely mechanisms. Increased probability of SD predicted in our model tended to occur when vehicles were allowed access to the CAZ, when farm staff had contacted other herds in the past 3 days, when the health status of purchased stock was not known and when manure was brought onto the farm and spread on land adjacent to the pig barns.

In general, choosing a threshold can depend on the use of the model and the implications of false positive and/or false negative errors (Marcot et al., 2006) . Prior information about the health status of the farm did not improve the fit of the model. One reason may be that a farm with a history of disease occurrence may have altered its biosecurity practices in response to that outbreak. This temporal misalignment between collection of biosecurity data and disease outbreak data is one limitation of our study, (indeed any retrospective cross-sectional study), which we are unable to account for. Since it is possible that diseased farms changed their biosecurity practices, misclassification of exposure is likely to be differential.

This is an important point because although four diseases were included in the BBN, the evidence for SD was only based on 4 outbreaks.

This result occurred because the farms that have no specified time interval between contacts did not report any cases of SD. Similarly when there was no specified time interval between farm staff contact with animals abroad and animals on the farm, the probability of PRRS and MP decreased (compared to a time interval of one night or more). When the time interval was more than three nights then the probability of SI increased. These results reflect the small sample size for these categories. There were 11 farms that employed the 'no specified time interval' policy and none reported a disease. Another noteworthy counter-intuitive result relates to vehicle access to the CAZ. When vehicle access to the CAZ was not allowed, there was an increased probability of PRRS and SI, compared to when vehicles were allowed to enter without cleaning or disinfecting. We suggest that the influence of this node is likely biased by the fact that the majority of farms included in the survey (n = 70) allowed vehicle access without cleaning or disinfecting.",

Such a structure is excellent for integrating information while maintaining a model of limited size (Gustafson et al., 2005; Needham et al., 2007) . Although, BBN's attempt to ensure conditional independence between nodes, we did not assess dependence of nodes for this simple model. Despite the underlying independence assumption in a na\u00efve BBN, they have proven to be powerful probabilistic models for solving classification problems in a variety of domains (Geenen et al., 2011) and have been shown to outperform more sophisticated models even for classification problems in which the assumption does not hold (Domingos and Pazzani, 1997) . Furthermore, in comparison to classical statistical analysis, our approach has a number of advantages. The logistic regression only allowed us to assess risk factors for presence or absence of disease, while the BBN allowed us to assess the occurrence of four different diseases and the impact of biosecurity practices simultaneously. Further, we were able to explicitly model causal factors, and we demonstrated how the tool can be used to arrive at decisions with visible, auditable reasoning.",

Thus we suggest a number of end users of a BBN model. On a small scale, this type of tool could be used by industry and vets within a province to create farm-specific risk profiles. On a wider scale, it could contribute to improving industry biosecurity practices nationally. At present, surveillance for swine endemic diseases occurs at a provincial level in Canada. An improvement to this system could be collation of farm data, along with laboratory and slaughterhouse data, by a coordinating body such as the CSHB. Creation of such a veterinary network and collation of syndromic data would enable the Canadian industry's mission of re-focusing efforts in animal health on a national basis. If such data existed then a BBN model could become a fundamental tool for identifying and monitoring pathogen threats.",

The central disease node (yellow) was connected to all other nodes via conditional probabilities. Within each node, the possible states (left hand side of the node) and the corresponding probability of each state is shown as a percentage and by the coloured bars. The node to switch between 'no history' and 'history' is shown on the right hand side and in this example is switched 'off'. This figure represents the \"steady state\" of BBN \u2212h .
