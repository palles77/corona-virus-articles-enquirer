The participating 135 herds were randomly selected from those in The Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System with at least 15 cow years. Each herd was followed for 1 yr. Blood samples from calves of >150 d of age (n = 1,348) were analyzed for antibodies against parainfluenza virus 3, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and Mycoplasma bovis. Calves reported to have been on pasture (n = 139) were tested for antibodies against Dictyocaulus viviparus. Seroprevalences for parainfluenza virus 3, BCoV, BRSV, and D. viviparus at the calf level were 50.2, 39.3, 31.2, and 4.3%, respectively. No calves were antibody positive for M. bovis. Calves in herds with BCoV-seropositive calves had an increased risk of respiratory disease compared with herds in which BCoV antibodies were not detected [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.9], as had calves in herds in which the majority (>54%) of the sampled calves were seropositive for BRSV (HR = 2.7). Other factors found to increase the risk of respiratory disease in calves were shared housing with cows during the first week of life compared with separate housing (HR = 16.7), a larger herd size (>50 cow years) compared with smaller herds (HR = 8.2), more than an 8-wk age difference between calves housed together in the same group pen compared with having pen mates of a more similar age (HR = 3.9), previous recordings of diarrhea compared with no recorded diarrhea (HR = 3.9), and leaving calves with dams for >24 h after birth compared with earlier separation (HR = 3.5).",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses, which are effectively spread by aerosol and direct contact between animals and herds, usually act in combination with other infectious agents, in particular bacteria, in the development of respiratory disease. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVD), and bovine herpes virus 1, have been found to be the most important viruses associated with respiratory disease in calves and young stock (Autio et al., 2007) . In a study of Norwegian dairy calves, Hyllseth et al. (1987) found that the overall seroprevalence was highest for PIV3, whereas antibodies against BRSV were less common. Norway has been declared free from BVD and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, which is caused by bovine herpes virus 1 (Kampen et al., 2007a; 2007b) . The major bacterial pathogens involved in respiratory disease, such as Mannheimia hemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, and Histophilus somni, may all be present as commensals in clinically healthy cattle, but secondary infections with one or more of these worsen the clinical outcome. Bovine mycoplasmas have been reported to be of increasing importance as a primary cause of calf pneumonia (Kusiluka et al., 2000) , and are often isolated from pneumonic lungs in combination with other pathogens (Booker et al., 2008) .",

To obtain roughly equal numbers of animals in each category, the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the proportion of antibody-positive calves among those sampled per herd were used. For BCoV, the percentiles on a herd level corresponded to >10, >33, >72, and >90% of the sampled calves being seropositive. The equivalent percentiles for BRSV were >0, >30, >54, and >70%, and for PIV3 were >30, >58, >75, and >90%, respectively. The infectious agents were first tested individually and then combined. In addition, dichotomous variables for herds with (1) or without (0) seropositive calves were created and tested separately for the 3 viruses. In the second model, the influence of housing and management (Table 1 ) on the occurrence of diarrhea was studied, and herds for which the questionnaire had not been returned were excluded (n = 10), leaving a total of 5,101 calves in the study population. A season variable was created for each calf based on its month of birth. Spring was defined as March through May, summer was defined as June through August, autumn was defined as September through November, and winter was defined as December through February. Hierarchical dummy variables were created for herd size divided into >20, >50, and >70 cow years. Hierarchical dummy variables were also created for parity of the dam divided into >1, >2, and >3 parities. Yearly milk yield in 1,000 kg/cow was included as a continuous variable.",

The present study shows that important respiratory pathogens are common in the Norwegian dairy cattle population, as in other cattle-producing countries (H\u00e4rtel et al., 2004; H\u00e4gglund et al., 2006) . Bovine respiratory syncytial virus, PIV3, and BCoV seem to be ubiquitous, because more than 70% of the herds were positive (Table 2) . Antibodies against M. bovis were not found, and respiratory disease caused by this agent has apparently not been reported in Norway. A recent Finnish study also reported similar results for M. bovis (Autio et al., 2007) . These results are in contrast to the situation reported in other countries, where M. bovis is considered an important cause of respiratory infections in cattle (Radaelli et al., 2008) . The present results and the fact that Norway is recognized as free from important infectious diseases such as BVD and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (Kampen et al., 2007a,b) indicate that a restrictive import policy is probably beneficial because it limits the introduction of new infectious agents. Routine screening at high-risk settings, such as bull-testing facilities, may be an option for detecting the introduction of infectious respiratory diseases, and molecular characterization of isolated viruses from such a setting may be a useful tool for monitoring those strains that are actively circulating in the cattle population.",

(2000) , who found that the risk of respiratory infections was greater in large herds (>50 cows) than in smaller herds. The number of animals susceptible to infections in large herds is higher than in small herds, which could contribute to maintaining infections circling within a herd over extended periods. The degree of human traffic and spreading of infectious agents between herds would also be greater in larger herds; therefore, the importance of establishing biosafety routines should be considered higher in larger herds than in smaller ones. Calves in larger herds tend to be more densely housed, resulting in closer animalto-animal contact, which could promote the spread of infections. Svensson and Liberg (2006) found that calves housed in group pens of more than 12 calves had an increased risk of respiratory disease. Nonsupervised calvings have also been associated with an increased risk of respiratory disease (Svensson et al., 2003) , and as herd size increases, the daily inspection of individual animals might be reduced.",

Both factors were found to have a significant effect on the occurrence of respiratory infection when cluster effects at the herd level were not included. Although the presence of the dam and suckling might increase the amount of IgG absorbed (Quigley et al., 1995) , calves left to suckle their dams have often been found to have insufficient IgG intake (Trotz-Williams et al., 2008) and the risk of disease in these calves is higher (Svensson et al., 2003) . Additional colostrum, fed manually by bottle, seems beneficial if the calf and dam are left together.",

Depending on animal density, the load of infectious agents in a stall housing both calves and cows is likely to be considerably higher than in a stall housing only calves, thereby increasing the risk of infections. However, young cattle should be regarded as the primary reservoir and as important contributors for most infectious calf pathogens (E. Jor, National Veterinary Institute, Oslo, personal communication). Svensson et al. (2003) found an increased risk of respiratory disease in calves of 1 to 12 wk of age housed in group pens of 6 to 30 animals compared with calves housed in smaller groups. Minimizing the age difference between calves housed in the same group pen is favorable because older calves are often the source of infection for younger calves (Maddox-Hyttel et al., 2006) .",
