Many cells that express multiple connexins produce heteromeric channels containing at least two connexins, which provides a means to fine tune gap junctional communication. Formation of channels by multiple connexins is controlled at two levels: by inherent structural compatibilities that enable connexins to hetero-oligomerize and by cellular mechanisms that restrict the formation of heteromers by otherwise compatible connexins. Here, I discuss roles for secretory compartments beyond the endoplasmic reticulum in connexin oligomerization and evidence that suggests that membrane microdomains help regulate connexin trafficking and assembly.",

Fleishman et al. [12] used a best-fit algorithm to assign the transmembrane domains of connexin 32 (Cx32) mathematically to the corresponding a helices in the structural model ( Figure 2 ). On the basis of their model, the best fit was obtained by assigning the third transmembrane domain as the predominant pore-lining helix [12] , although this is controversial [13] . Different types of cell express different connexins and cells frequently express two or more connexins [14] [15] [16] . Because an individual gap junction channel is composed of 12 connexins, cells that express multiple connexins can produce mixed channels, provided that the connexins are able to hetero-oligomerize. The formation of gap junction channels by two or more connexins enables cells to produce channels that have unique permeability and gating characteristics that could not be obtained using a single connexin [17] . However, the rules that govern connexin oligomerization and compatibility are complex.",

Connexins do not ubiquitously intermix; instead, compatibility is based on their protein structure. When two connexins expressed in the same cell form a mixed channel, this is referred to as heteromeric compatibility. Examples of heteromeric channels formed by endogenously expressed connexins include Cx32-Cx26 in the liver [15, 18] , Cx46-Cx50 in the lens [19] and Cx43-Cx46 in the lung [20] . Heteromeric connexin compatibility has been tested using transfected cell models, although there are many combinations that have not been examined. The heteromeric compatibility groups correspond loosely to a and b connexin subfamiles [15, 17] . Connexins that do not belong in either of these subgroups have been found to form heteromers with either a connexins (e.g. Cx45-Cx43) [21] or b connexins (e.g. mCx29-Cx32) [22] .

Heterotypic channels have been identified in several settings in vivo, most notably in the central nervous system (CNS), in which astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are interconnected exclusively through heterotypic channels [26, 27] . Although such gap junctions can contain channels with unique permeability characteristics, a more prominent role for specific heterotypic interactions is to form intercellular networks by either promoting or restricting cell interconnectivity. Disulfide bridges that interconnect the two extracellular domains are crucial for channel formation [28, 29] . Two key amino acids in the second extracellular loop are the major determinants of heterotypic compatibility [15, 30] , although motifs in the first extracellular loop and other parts of the protein might also have a role [31] . In contrast to innate heteromeric compatibility, innate heterotypic compatibility does not correlate well with whether a given connexin is an a or b family member [15, 32] . For example, Cx32 and Cx43 cannot form heterotypic channels; however, the a connexins Cx46 and Cx50 can form heterotypic channels with either Cx32 or Cx43 [30] . In addition, some connexins, including Cx31 and Cx36, appear to only form homotypic channels [32, 33] .",

Instead, Cx37 was incorporated into junctions interconnecting either two adjacent endothelial cells or two adjacent smooth muscle cells. This suggests that the vasculature regulates connexin hetero-oligomerization and uses polarized delivery of connexins to different plasma membrane domains to produce three distinct classes of cell-cell interface that influence intercellular signaling pathways. Polarized connexin targeting also has a role in regulating heteromer formation in the CNS [22, 26, 27] and oocyte-granulosa cell interfaces [37, 38] . The mechanisms to control connexin hetero-oligomerization and trafficking are not well defined at present.

            "text": "Connexins do not follow the classical pathway for transmembrane protein oligomerization when forming hexamers. Similar to most channel-forming proteins [39] , connexins oligomerize into a multimeric complex before delivery to the plasma membrane. However, Cx43 oligomerizes into hexamers after exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a secretory compartment distal to the medial Golgi, which is probably the trans Golgi network (TGN) [35, 40] (Figure 4 ). This is consistent with the notion of a quality-control system in the Golgi apparatus [41, 42] that complements ER quality-control pathways [43] . However, identifying specific components of the quality-control apparatus that regulates connexin oligomerization has been difficult. This difficulty is partly due to different systems giving apparently conflicting results. For example, several connexins, including Cx26, Cx32 and Cx43, oligomerize when translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes [18, 44, 45] . Although this has been cited as evidence that connexin oligomerization naturally occurs in the ER, another possibility is that microsomes lack components of the quality-control apparatus that are present in the intact ER and that inhibit connexin oligomerization. Consistent with this, addition of liver Golgi membranes to the in vitro translation microsome mix enhances Cx32 oligomerization and promotes the formation of Cx26-Cx32 heteromers [18] . Also, the ER pool of Cx32 in guinea pig liver is monomeric, although the ER pool of Cx26 does show partial oligomerization [46] . Factors provided by Golgi membranes that promote connexin oligomerization remain to be identified.",

            "text": "Cells do not have an unlimited capacity for quality control of protein folding and assembly. This is a particular problem when analyzing the assembly of connexins transfected into cells because overexpression could drive premature connexin oligomerization. For example, overexpression initiates the formation of intracellular plaque-like structures in the ER of transfected BHK cells suggesting aberrant connexin assembly [47] . Overexpressed newly synthesized connexins, including Cx26, Cx32 and Cx43, oligomerized in the ER, whereas endogenous Cx32 and Cx43 expressed at much lower levels did not (J.K. VanSlyke and L.S. Musil, personal communication); however, transfected HeLa cells have been used to show that Cx26 oligomerizes following exit from the ER [24] . Cx43 overexpression induces premature oligomerization [48] and it has been suggested that overexpression might underlie some of the conflicting results obtained using transfected cell models to study connexin trafficking and oligomerization [7, 49] . Taken together, these results suggest that care should be taken in producing and interpreting these models. Conversely, it is plausible that there might be physiological circumstances in which high levels of connexin expression might regulate hexamer formation by inducing early connexin oligomerization in the ER, although, to date, this has not been directly demonstrated in a system examining endogenously expressed connexins. Although unusual, transmembrane protein oligomerization in a post-ER secretory compartment is not unique to connexins. For example, targeting of coronavirus coat proteins [50] and Golgi resident enzymes [51] correlates with oligomerization in the Golgi apparatus. Remodeling and assembly of ion channels, such as ENaC and Na-K ATPases, can occur in late secretory compartments and at the plasma membrane [52] [53] [54] . Another class of proteins that oligomerize in the Golgi apparatus are tetraspanins, such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD151 [55] . However, tetraspanins also hetero-oligomerize with several other classes of transmembrane protein, such as integrins, in the ER [56, 57] (Box 1).",

Given these potential pitfalls, connexin chimeras containing a dilysine-based C-terminal ER retention-retrieval sequence, HKKSL, were used to study early events in connexin oligomerization [60, 61] . Consistent with Cx43 oligomerization in the Golgi apparatus or TGN, ER-localized Cx43-HKKSL is monomeric. In contrast to Cx43, ER-localized Cx32-HKKSL oligomerizes.

Access and retrieval of proteins containing di-lysine motifs from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and, to a lesser extent, the cis Golgi stack form a retrograde recycling pathway, which contributes to quality control in the secretory pathway [63, 64] . By contrast, ER retrieval of di-lysine-containing proteins from late Golgi compartments and the TGN is relatively rare [65] . Consistent with this, a small fraction of Golgi apparatus Figure 4 . Connexin oligomerization pathways. Connexins are co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane. Depending on the connexin subtype, oligomerization can occur either in the ERGIC (Cx32, blue) or the TGN (Cx43, green). The potential for connexin oligomerization in the ER, driven by high levels of connexin expression, is also shown for Cx32. Hemichannels are subsequently transported to the plasma membrane, where they can function as channels or pair with hemichannels on adjacent cells to form complete intercellular channels. Channels at the plasma membrane further assemble into semi-crystalline arrays known as gap junction plaques, which can contain from tens to thousands of channels. Homogenous plaques are composed of either a single connexin or heteromeric connexins (not shown). Heterogeneous plaques contain regions enriched for different connexins.",

This type of control is more important for inherently compatible connexins, such as Cx37 and Cx43 or Cx43 and Cx46, as opposed to inherently incompatible connexins, such as Cx32 and Cx43.

Although this suggests that functional ZO-1 might enhance the transition of Cx43 from microdomains to gap junction plaques, ZO-1 binding is not an absolute requirement for their formation, because connexins that do not bind to ZO-1 can form plaques [73, 77, 78] . In fact, ZO-1 might also serve to limit plaque size [77] . In general, studies that focus strictly on binary connexin-ZO-1 interactions should be interpreted with caution. For example, the effect of mutant or wild-type ZO-1 on connexins might be indirect because these proteins might interfere with or promote the binding of other proteins to the connexin C terminus.",
