Our sequence data from a mitochondrial gene fragment (1176 base pair long) had a similarity of between 99% and 89% to Dipylidium caninum. We determined infection prevalence in 146 faecal samples from 124 known animals in three social groups (termed clans) using molecular screening and Dipylidium proglottid presence. Our analysis revealed significantly higher infection prevalence in juveniles (55%) than adults (15.8%), indicating that predominantly juveniles maintained infection in clans. The likelihood of infection in juveniles significantly: (1) increased as the number of adults and older juveniles (>6 months) at communal dens increased, implying a positive relationship between this factor and the size of the intermediate host (probably a flea species) population at communal dens; (2) decreased as the number of younger juveniles (<6 months) increased, suggesting that the chance of susceptible juveniles ingesting infected fleas during self-grooming declined as the number of infected fleas per younger juvenile declined; and (3) decreased during periods of low prey abundance in clan territories when an increased reliance on long-distances foraging excursions reduces the number of clan members visiting communal dens, possibly resulting in a decline in flea populations at dens. Long-distance foraging also increases the intervals (in days) between nursing visits by lactating females to their offspring. Lengthy intervals between milk intake by infected juveniles may reduce adult Dipylidium fecundity and hence decrease infection prevalence in the den flea population. Our study provides useful insights into Dipylidium epidemiology in a social carnivore population subject to large fluctuations in prey abundance.",

Fleas in the genus Ctenocephalides are considered the main intermediate hosts of D. caninum but fleas in the genus Pulex and the dog louse Trichodectes canis can also act as intermediate hosts (Pugh, 1987) . Eggs of D. caninum are ingested by flea larvae and D. caninum larvae then hatch and migrate into the body cavity. Infective cysticercoid larvae develop when adult fleas emerge from their cocoons and encounter the high body temperature of a mammalian host (Pugh, 1987) . Mammalian hosts are infected when they ingest infected fleas, for example during grooming. Mammalian hosts infected with D. caninum may have a high worm burden (e.g., up to 130 adult worms) because larval fleas typically ingest whole worm packets, resulting in the development of multiple cysticercoids per flea (Nichol et al., 1981) .",

            "text": "Whether ingestion of an infected flea results in the development of an adult Dipylidium spp. parasite may depend on the quality of the immune response of the mammalian host to infection. Studies on mammalian host immune responses to Taenia species (reviewed by Lightowlers et al., 2003) and of rodents to Hymenolepis diminuta infection (reviewed by McKay, 2010) have revealed complex host immune responses to cestode infection and evidence for the development of immunological memory following an initial infection with some but not all cestodes. Furthermore, cross immunity between cestode species may occur, as previous and concurrent infection with one species can prevent infection with another species (e.g., Gabriele et al., 1988; Ito et al., 1988; Wang and McKay, 2005) . There is evidence that acquisition of immunity against helminth parasites may be impaired by severe undernourishment, particularly in hosts that lose protein mass (reviewed by Coop and Kyriazakis, 1999) , possibly because of tradeoffs between the allocation of body resources to immunity and other key body functions (Coop and Kyriazakis, 1999; Schmid-Hempel, 2011) .",

Neither the genetic identity of this parasite nor the factors influencing infection in spotted hyaenas are known. Our study aimed to provide the first genetic information for the Dipylidium species infecting this host in East Africa and to investigate ecological, demographic, behavioural and physiological factors that may influence Dipylidium infection in this social carnivore. We assumed the intermediate host of this Dipylidium species is probably a flea (Insecta, Siphonaptera) and possibly the 'stick fast flea' Echidnophaga larina. Adult stick fast fleas live attached to the skin of their host. E. larina was found on nine spotted hyaenas examined in the Kruger National Park, South Africa (Horak et al., 2004 ) and a species of stick fast fleas occur on spotted hyaenas in our study population. There is also evidence from Kenya that E. larina from an unspecified jackal species carry Dipylidium cysticercoids in Kenya (Spinage, 2012) .",

            "text": "The spotted hyaena is a social carnivore which forms multifemale, multi-male clans (Kruuk, 1972; Frank, 1986a; . Clans are fission fusion societies in which individual members or small groups operate independently and clan members only congregate at large carcasses (Kruuk, 1972; Frank, 1986a) , or when called to cooperate in activities such as boundary disputes with neighbouring clans (East and Hofer, 1991) . All adult females reproduce and rear their offspring at a communal den inside the clan's territory (Kruuk, 1972) . Individuals of both sexes visit communal dens (Fig. 1a) to socialise with other clan members (Smale et al., 1993) and scent-mark . Information on flea biology (reviewed by Dryden and Rust, 1994; Bitam et al., 2010) suggests that spotted hyaena communal dens are the location within a clan's territory likely to contain a large part of the intermediate host population (in terms of adult fleas and their larvae) of Dipylidium because flea infestations are known to accumulate at sites frequently used by mammal hosts. Hence we assume that the non-adhesive eggs produced by fleas infesting spotted hyaenas at clan communal dens (including animals visiting dens and juveniles based at dens) fall onto soil in the den area (Fig 1a) and into underground burrows or are removed during grooming, and that the accumulation of eggs in the den vicinity increases with the number of clan members present at communal dens. Flea egg development requires a microenvironment in which temperature and relative humidity should remain within certain limits. We suspect this rarely occurs above ground but is likely in underground burrows of the communal den. Moreover, as flea larvae avoid light and move towards gravity, and are susceptible to desiccation, larvae that hatch or move into burrows are possibly more likely to survive than those exposed to desiccation and high temperatures above ground (see Dryden and Rust, 1994; Bitam et al., 2010) . Hence communal den areas are likely to be locations with an accumulation of flea eggs and underground burrows of dens provide a microhabitat conducive to flea laval development.",

The foraging behaviour of spotted hyaenas in the Serengeti National Park is unusual in that it has evolved to permit year-round consumption of migratory herbivores, mostly wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), Thomson's gazelle (Gazella thomsoni), and plains zebra (Equus quagga) (Hofer and East, 1993a,b) . When prey abundance is low in a clan's territory, all migratory herbivores are absent and only resident prey is present. During these periods, solitary clan members or small groups travel long-distances on round trips of between 80 and 140 km (termed commuting trips) to locate large congregations of migratory prey on which to feed before returning to their home territory (Hofer and East, 1993a,b) . When a high abundance of migratory prey is present in a clan's territory, all clan members forage in their home territory (Hofer and East, 1993c) . During periods between these two extremes, when only small herds of migratory prey are present in a clan's territory, commuting frequency is determined by an individual's social status. Commuting trips of lactating females last between 2 and 9 day (Hofer and East, 1993c) .",

Firstly, commuting reduces the number of clan members visiting communal dens (Hofer and East, 1993c) , which would be expected to lead to a reduction in the size of the communal den flea population. Secondly, commuting increases the period between nursing bouts for dependent juveniles at communal dens and can significantly reduce their milk intake East, 1993c, 2008) . We expected the reduced nutritional status of juveniles during commuting periods to compromise juvenile immune responses and hence increase infection prevalence. Juveniles show considerable variation in faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (fGMCs) ranging between 4.6 and 377.4 ng/g (Benhaiem et al., 2012) , and those experiencing challenging social and physical environments have elevated fGMCs, indicative of an elevated allostatic load (Benhaiem et al., 2013) . We expected highly elevated fGMCs to increase prevalence of Dipylidium infection because of allocation trade-offs in the investment of body resources in immunity and maintenance.",

Licking removes flea eggs and hence might reduce the level of flea infestation, but might also result in the ingestion of Dipylidium infected adult fleas (Dryden and Rust, 1994) . We investigated grooming behaviour to assess how often juveniles groom themselves and mothers groom their offspring and whether the frequency of grooming change with juvenile age.

Clans contained a mean \u00b1 SEM of 89 \u00b1 1.49 animals, including a mean of 33 \u00b1 5.8 adult females during the study period and approximately the same number of reproductively active adult males. All animals were individually known Benhaiem et al., 2012) and their life histories were monitored . The age of animals born in study clans was determined (\u00b17 days) using pelage and other characteristics (Pournelle, 1965; East et al., 1989) . Animals were considered adult when 24 months of age (East et al., 2009) . Juveniles were categorised as 'younger' when <6 months of age (mean age 122.3 \u00b1 3.7 days) and 'older' when between 6 months and 24 months of age (mean age 284.7 \u00b1 15.4 days). The sex of juveniles was determined at approximately 3 months of age as detailed by Frank et al. (1990) . Females reproduce throughout the year; their litters of one or two offspring (rare triplet litters never survive more than a few weeks in our study clans) are entirely dependent on maternal milk for their first six months of life East, 2003, 2008) and are weaned at between 12 and 18 months of age (Hofer and East, 1995) . Younger juveniles rested during most daylight hours in underground burrows of communal dens. Older juveniles use underground burrows at the communal den but as they develop towards adulthood they increasingly rest elsewhere during the day. The underground burrows of communal dens were not accessible to adults (Hofer and East, 2008) . Communal dens of all study clans were monitored during regular observations periods of several hours at dusk and dawn East, 1993a, Benhaiem et al., 2012) .",

To avoid pseudo-replication in the analyses we used only one (randomly chosen) faecal sample per juvenile. We used a Fisher's exact test to compare the prevalence of Dipylidium sp. positive animals in 117 juveniles (including 52 females and 65 males) and 20 adults. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare infection in 13 females screened when juvenile and again later as adults. We applied a Chi-square test to compare the incidence of positive samples in faeces with fGMCs above or below the mean concentration in juveniles. We used binary logistic regression models to investigate biologically relevant factors that might influence infection likelihood in juveniles, including those likely to alter flea infestation at communal dens and juvenile immune status. Infection of an animal (the dependent variable) was scored as present if the result of PCR screening was positive or Dipylidium proglottids were present on the faeces when collected, or absent if the PCR screening result was negative and no proglottids were observed on the faeces when collected. Our final model (Table 2) included the following parameters for the date on which each faecal sample was collected: (1) the number of younger juveniles present at the communal den, the most na\u00efve age class to Dipylidium infection; (2) the number of adults and older juveniles present at the communal den as an index of the number of adult fleas brought to the den and of the flea eggs these fleas were likely to shed at the den; (3) maternal standardised rank as an index of juvenile body resources; (4) prey abundance (3 levels: high, medium and low) as an index of current maternal input in terms of the interval between visits to nurse offspring at the den; and (5) juvenile age in days. This was the model with the smallest values for the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). In preliminary models we had considered alternative indices of the number of adult fleas brought to the den, namely the number of adult males at the den, the number of adult females at the den and total clan size. Replacing these parameters with parameter (2) above substantially reduced the AIC and BIC. We also considered clan identity as a possible source of variation and fGMCs as a measure of the allostatic load of each juvenile (Benhaiem et al., 2013) . Removing these from the preliminary model also reduced the AIC and BIC. Models were considered equally parsimonious when the differences in AIC and BIC were less than 2. The significance threshold of tests was fixed at 5% and all tests were two-tailed.",

The decline in infection in individuals from when they were juvenile to when they were adult suggests that most animals in the population had acquired immunity against Dipylidium infection by the time they reached adulthood. This suggests an increased development of an immunological memory of Dipylidium with age. It is worth noting that although mothers frequently groomed their offspring, and presumably often ingested Dipylidium infected fleas, only a relatively small proportion of adult females were infected with Dipylidium. This suggests that effective immunity against Dipylidium infection in the adult population may be maintained by the repeated ingestion of infected fleas throughout adulthood. A similar decrease in the prevalence of coronavirus infection with increasing age was observed in our study population (Goller et al., 2013) with juveniles having lower coronavirus antibody titres than adults (East et al., 2004) . Another possible reason for the decreased prevalence of Dipylidium infection in adults is the development of cross immunity following infection with other cestode species. Ungulates are intermediate hosts of cestodes whose final hosts are carnivores. Decreased reliance on maternal milk during weaning is highly likely to lead to infection with other cestodes during adulthood which may cause the elimination of Dipylidium.",

These females produced na\u00efve young throughout the year, thereby regularly introducing new clan members susceptible to Dipylidium infection.

On the contrary, our model indicated that the prevalence of Dipylidium infection in juveniles significantly decreased during periods of low prey abundance (Table 2, Fig. 2 ) when juveniles often receive no milk from their mothers for several days (Hofer and East, 1993c . Three processes may explain this result. Firstly, because all adult clan members forage on distant, large concentrations of migratory herbivores when prey abundance in their territory is low, the low number of clan members visiting communal dens during periods of low prey abundance may cause a reduction in the flea population at the den. Secondly, during periods when juveniles receive no milk for several days, the nutrients available to Dipylidium (in the alimentary canal of hungry juveniles) for egg and proglottid production will be reduced. If the fecundity of Dipylidium is curtailed by decreased milk intake by juveniles, this might reduce infection prevalence in the intermediate (flea) population at the communal den. Finally, this result might simply reflect an increased number of false negative results caused by a low fecundity among adult Dipylidium in hungry juveniles. Interestingly, even though the offspring of high-ranking mothers are significantly better nourished than those of low-ranking mothers in the long-term , there was no evidence that their offspring had a lower prevalence of infection.",

However, we determined fGMCs in only 51 of the 117 juveniles in our study. This reduced the power of our model, and few of these juveniles had fGMCs likely to cause a biologically meaningful reduction in immune function. Furthermore, longer-term measures of fGMCs are required to identify chronically stressed juveniles in which immunosuppression might occur. As we determined only the presence or absence of Dipylidium infection, our results do not exclude the possibility that elevated fGMCs increase infection intensity in juveniles. Juvenile spotted hyaenas less than two months of age rarely venture from the immediate vicinity of entrances to underground burrows of the communal den, and at this age their mothers typically consume their faeces. Older clan members at dens generally leave the den area and defaecate in communal latrines (East et al., 2004) which are at least eight metres from the den area. These two behaviours possibly decrease the chance of flea larvae in communal den areas consuming Dipylidium eggs voided in faeces. Even though the use of latrines most likely greatly curtails the number of Dipylidium eggs available for consumption by flea larvae in the den, proglottids or egg sacs that adhere to fur around the anus of infected animals may be transported to communal dens and infect fleas.",

            "text": "Studies of intestinal parasite infection in mammals apply either necropsy or coprology methods (Table 1) . Necropsy requires either the opportunistic collection of carcasses, which may not provide a representative sample of a host population, or the sacrifice of animals. Coprology methods can provide a representative sample of a host population and also permit the repeated assessment of infection in the same animal, for example at different life history stages or during different ecological conditions. Even so, coprology methods can yield false negative results, regardless of whether traditional methods (i.e. egg flotation and identification) or genetic screening techniques are applied (e.g. Drogemuller et al., 2004) because of the prepatent period following initial infection and the intermittent release of eggs by intestinal parasites. Our assessment of our genetic screening method indicated that it was reasonably sensitive, but even so a proportion of negative faeces (23.5%) had Dipylidium proglottids on them when collected. We suggest these false negative genetic screening results probably were caused by the clumped distribution of Dipylidium DNA in faeces (i.e. eggs in packets and proglottids). We therefore suggest to combine data on the occurrence of proglottids on freshly deposited faeces with genetic screening results to reduce the chance of false negative results in studies of Dipylidium infection in mammalian hosts.",

            "text": "Within the diverse guild of wild carnivore species present in the Serengeti National Park, evidence of Dipylidium infection was reported in golden jackal (Canis aureus), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus) and silver-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) in Kenya (Nelson et al., 1965, Table 1 ), and it is likely that these species are infected with Dipylidium in the Serengeti National Park. Studies on African lion (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti National Park did not find evidence of Dipylidium infection (M\u00fcller-Graf, 1995; Bjork et al., 2000) . Coprology studies of Dipylidium infection in wild carnivores rarely describe the age of the animals from which samples were collected. Our results indicate that information on host age is essential for the interpretation of results and comparisons of infection prevalence across species. Horak et al. (2004) reported that E. larina frequently infests the warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) but normally not carnivores which may be because most carnivores do not share underground burrows with warthogs. However, spotted hyaenas use warthog burrows to rest during the day and occasionally warthogs use burrows within spotted hyaena denning area. If E. larina is the main intermediate host of Dipylidium in the Serengeti National Park, co-habitation of warthog burrows may have a positive effect of E. larina populations in spotted hyaena clans.",

It is the first to show decreased infection during periods of low prey abundance in a migratory ecosystem where carnivores experience large fluctuations in prey abundance in their territories. Our study highlights the importance of communal denning, the presence of susceptible juveniles and the intermediate host population at dens for Dipylidium infection in spotted hyaena clans. We suspect that host age and denning behaviour are important factors influencing Dipylidium infection prevalence in other wild carnivores. More genetic information is needed from D. caninum worldwide to clarify whether Dipylidium species that infect wild carnivores are D. caninum or distinct species.",
