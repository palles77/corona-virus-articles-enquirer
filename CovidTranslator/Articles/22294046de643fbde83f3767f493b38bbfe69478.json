The results showed that, rabbits in the experimental group immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV all generated specific IgG antibodies with neutralizing activity, which suggested the inactivated SARS-CoV could preserve its antigenicity well and elicit an effective humoral immune responses. The peak titer value of specific IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody reached 1:40960 and 1:2560 respectively. In the experimental group, no obvious histopathological changes was detected in the H&E stained slides of heart, spleen, kidney and testis samples, but the livers had slight histopathological changes, and the lungs presented remarkable histopathological changes. These findings are of importance for SARS-CoV inactivated vaccine development. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel viral epidemic which spread to more than thirty countries in 2003 and severely threatened worldwide public health. The clinical symptom of SARS is characterized by fever, dyspnoea, lymphopenia, and rapidly progressing changes observed by radiography. Its pathogen has been affirmed to be a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which VIROLOGICA SINICA Vol.22, No 5 by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EL-ISA). A 96-wells microtiter plate was coated with inactivated SARS-CoV dilution (containing 1.0 \u03bcg/ mL total virus proteins). Then 2-fold serial serum dilutions were added (100 \u03bcL/well) and incubated at 37 for 60 min. The plate was washed with PBST, HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:1000 dillution, Sino-American Biotech) were added (100 \u03bcL/well), and incubated at 37 for 60 min. The plate was washed, then OPD substrate (O-pheny-lendiamine, Sigma) was added (100 \u03bcL/well) and incubated at 37 for 20 min. The reaction was stopped with 2.0 mol/L",

D: Some liver cell degeneration, slight ballooning degeneration in rarefied cytoplasm. lungs showed marked histopathological changes. The representative profiles and relevant notation are shown in Fig. 4. DISCUSSION Immunogenicity evaluation is a basis for viral inactivated vaccine development. In this study, SARS-CoV was 100% inactivated by treating with 0.4% formaldehyde (v/v) for 24 h, which ensured the antigenicity was maintained (7). Three sets of immunizations at 2-week intervals were administrated. The results showed that the SARS-CoV F69 strain inactivated vaccine could elicit a potent humoral immune responses in rabbits, and the specific antibodies including neutralizing antibodies, remained at high levels for a extended period. Our other studies on the evaluation of inactivated SARS-CoV in mice (15,16), pigs and horses (results not shown) also showed positive results which demonstrated the strong immunogenicity of this virus. Bioinformatics analyses of the SARS-CoV genome may provide valuable information for vaccine development. In this study, rabbit antiserum was detected with a SARS specific protein chip. From the profiles in Fig. 3, the positive interaction signals fully identified the specificity of the antiserum antibodies. Furthermore, the different signal intensity (data not shown) indicated different antigenicities for the tested SARS-CoV proteins, the S protein (comprising 4 separate segments on the chip) was much stronger compared with the N, 3CL, or M proteins.It is of interest that rabbits immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV exhibited interstitial pneumonitis and liver cell degeneration which were not present in control group. We are certain such histopathological changes were not because of incomplete inactivation since the inactivation efficiency to cultured SRAS-CoV was precisely identified(5,6,16). The possible causes of this immunization-induced tissue damages may be the anti-SARS-CoV antibody cross-reacting with cytokine and thus modulating cytokine responses (1), the induction of autoantibodies(12), or virusinduced cell-mediated immuopathological responses(14). Based on the primary observation above, further investigations are worthwhile to confirm these histopathological changes, detect the principal mechanism, and to find the possible relationship with immunization dosages.",
