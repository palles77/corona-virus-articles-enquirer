The respective targets selected for the assay were the conserved NS5 and E1 genes of the two viruses. Due to the insufficient number of NS5 sequences from SLEV strains in the GenBank database, we determined the sequence of an approximately 1-kb region for each of 25 strains of SLEV in order to select primers and probes in a conserved region. Our assay has a sensitivity of 5 gene copies/reaction for EEEV and 10 gene copies/reaction for SLEV, and it's performance is linear over at least 6 log 10 gene copies. The assay is specific and detected all strains of SLEV (69) and EEEV (12) that were tested. An internal control ensures detection of efficient nucleic acid extraction and possible PCR inhibition.",

            "text": "Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an arthropod-borne virus belonging to the genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes to equines, birds, and humans and causes a febrile disease (including encephalitis) with a significant frequency of fatal outcomes. With an overall case fatality rate of approximately 36% (Deresiewicz et al., 1997) , it is the most severe of the arboviral encephalitides. EEEV is a spherical, enveloped virus with an 11.5-kb genome consisting of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA. The 5\u2032 end of the alphavirus genome encodes for the nonstructural proteins (NSP1-4), and the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes for the structural proteins (core and envelope proteins). The E1 and E2 proteins, virally encoded surface glycoproteins, are the target of numerous serological reactions and tests. The E2 protein is the site of most of the neutralizing epitopes (Roehrig, 1986) , and the E1 protein contains more conserved, cross-reactive epitopes (Dalrymple et al., 1976; Wolcott et al., 1984) . Apart from the six C-terminal codons, the E1 gene is largely conserved among alphaviruses (Powers et al., 2001) , although there is sufficient diversity to allow selection of primers and probes that are specific for the EEEV genome.",

This virus belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus serocomplex within the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. SLEV is endemic in the United States and circulates in a transmission cycle involving Culex mosquitoes and passerine birds (Tsai and Mitchell, 1989) , with humans and other vertebrates as incidental hosts. Clinical disease caused by SLEV infection can vary from mild symptoms, including febrile illness and headache, to severe disease, including meningitis and encephalitis. Reports of case fatalities range from 5 to 20% (Tsai and Mitchell, 1989) although the numbers are higher still among the elderly population. The virus has a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 11-kb. The 5\u2032 end of the viral genome consists of genes for the structural proteins, and the 3\u2032 end consists of genes for the nonstructural proteins. The NS5 gene encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is reported as being the most highly conserved of the flavivirus nonstructural proteins (Iacono-Connors et al., 1992; Scaramozzino et al., 2001) .",

However, serological tests have certain limitations; cross-reactivity of flaviviral antibodies is problematic in immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (MAC-ELISA), and plaque reduction neutralization is time-consuming, cumbersome and requires biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment (Calisher, 1994; Russell and Dwyer, 2000; Martin et al., 2004) . The traditional method of virus isolation also has the latter limitations and in addition, since the period of viremia is generally short, the likelihood of obtaining an isolate is low (Calisher, 1994) . RT-PCR is a rapid and sensitive method that is being used increasingly as an adjunct to serology for the diagnosis of arboviruses. Case in point is the wide-spread use of PCR for the detection of West Nile virus (WNV) (Lanciotti and Kerst, 2001; Briese et al., 2000) .",

The resultant 146-bp fragment of the E1 gene of EEEV was cloned into the PCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

The transcript RNAs were subjected to two rounds of DNase I digestion and were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and sepharose chromatography.

Ten-fold serial dilutions of genomic EEEV strain 69-7836 viral RNA and the transcript were made, and real-time RT-PCR was performed. A standard curve was constructed, allowing quantitation of the genomic viral RNA. Conventional RT-PCR was performed using primers SLE-NS5-F1 and SLE-NS5-R1 (Table 1) targeting SLEV strain MSI-7.

Between 1964 and 2004, the greatest numbers of human cases in the U.S. occurred in Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, and New Jersey (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/eeefact.htm). SLEV in contrast, is found throughout the 48 contiguous states, but periodic epidemics have only been documented in the Midwest and the Southeastern U.S. (including Florida) (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/sle/index.html; Wells et al., 1990) . A molecular assay that detects both SLEV and EEEV thus has considerable application for patients suspected of having arboviral encephalitis who reside in these areas, as well as travelers who could have come into contact with infected mosquitoes.",

The targets for the PCR assay are sited within conserved regions of the genome; namely, the E1 gene of EEEV and the NS5 gene of SLEV. The assay is intended for patient CSF samples but can easily be used for vector surveillance. We found the optimal PCR kit for this assay to be the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System. The linear assay range is 5 to 5 \u00d7 10 6 gc/reaction for EEEV, and 10 to 3 \u00d7 10 6 gc/reaction for SLEV. The sensitivity of the assay is 5 gc/reaction for EEEV and 10 gc/reaction for SLEV. The assay is specific, in that the primers and probes did not cross-react with any of the organisms in the specificity panel that we used. The assay detected all of the strains of SLEV (69 strains) and EEEV (12 strains) that we tested. We compared our assay to a previously published real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assay for the detection of SLEV which targets the envelope gene (Lanciotti and Kerst, 2001) . Although the two assays were similar in sensitivity and specificity, the previously published assay did not detect all SLEV strains; four of the 69 SLEV strains in Table 2 (CorAn 9275, CorAn 9124, GML 903797, and GML 903369) were not detected (data not shown). This is not surprising, given that the primers and probe had multiple mismatches when aligned with the genome sequence of these strains; as many as 10 mismatches in total occurred for each of strains CorAn 9275 and CorAn 9124. In our SLEV assay, the primers and probes were selected to enable the detection of a greater variety of strains by targeting the conserved NS5 region.",

We would therefore recommend that if plasma or serum specimens are tested, the nucleic acid extracts from the specimens are not diluted prior to performing the GFP real-time RT-PCR assay in order to detect inhibition more accurately since the pre-dilution may overcome some of the inhibitory effect.",
