Although natu ral glycopeptide antibiotics do not exhibit pronounced antiviral activity in such tests, chemical removal of sugars and introduction of hydrophobic residues into resulting aglycons or pseudo aglycons generates hydrophobic derivatives that are active against some viruses.",

Preliminary findings showed that glycopeptide aglycon derivatives act at the entry [11, 17] and post entry [14] stages of the virus infection cycle. The processes of virus penetration into the host cell and its replication provided by specific interactions between viral structural or non structural (co)receptors. The mechanisms of the antiviral activity of glycopeptide agly con derivatives remain unclear. Virus entry to the cell and its life cycle depend on the use of intracellular signal transduction pathways. On these grounds, we screened several hydrophobic glycopeptide aglycon derivatives for their inhibitory activity against a panel of PKs.",
