            "text": "Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) are host receptors for the Dr family of adhesins of Escherichia coli. To define the mechanism for binding of Dr adhesins to CEACAM receptors, we carried out structural studies on the N-terminal domain of CEA and its complex with the Dr adhesin. The crystal structure of CEA reveals a dimer similar to other dimers formed by receptors with IgV-like domains. The structure of the CEA/Dr adhesin complex is proposed based on NMR spectroscopy and mutagenesis data in combination with biochemical characterization. The Dr adhesin/CEA interface overlaps appreciably with the region responsible for CEA dimerization. Binding kinetics, mutational analysis, and spectroscopic examination of CEA dimers suggest that Dr adhesins can dissociate CEA dimers prior to the binding of monomeric forms. Our conclusions include a plausible mechanism for how E. coli, and perhaps other bacterial and viral pathogens, exploit CEACAMs. The present structure of the complex provides a powerful tool for the design of novel inhibitory strategies to treat E. coli infections.",

The CEACAM family is a group of highly glycosylated intercellular adhesion molecules involved in intracellular signaling events. They are comprised of an N-terminal Ig variable (IgV)-like domain followed by up to six Ig(C) domains (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) . CEACAM1 and CEACAM3 are inserted into the plasma membrane via a transmembrane domain and possess a carboxy terminal cytoplasmic domain, while CEA and CEACAM6 are anchored to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol.",

The GFCC'C\" face of the N-terminal domain mediates these interactions and several reports have implicated specific amino acid residues, Y34, V39, D40, R43 and Q44, in recognition (Markel et al., 2004; Taheri et al., 2000; Tan et al., 2002; Watt et al., 2001) . .

Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) was used to derive an ensemble for the solution structure of the N-CEA/Dr adhesin complex. Mutational analysis confirmed the N-CEA residues critical for the formation of the N-CEA/Dr adhesin complex. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), analytical ultracentrifugation and tetramethylrhodamine labeling were used to determine the monomer/dimer equilibrium of N-terminal wild-type and mutant CEACAM domains in the absence and presence of Dr adhesins. Our data demonstrate that binding of Dr adhesins to CEACAM surfaces prevents homophilic interactions involved in dimerization. This binding event is likely enhanced by avidity effects (as expected from a high local concentration of adhesin molecules in the Dr fimbriae) and is consistent with the observed clustering of CEACAM molecules on epithelial membranes upon binding of Dr + E. coli strains. Furthermore, our observations suggest that",

            "text": "To obtain detailed information about the structure of human CEA, we carried out crystallographic studies of the N-terminal domain (N-CEA), which is composed of a single IgV-like domain. The crystal structure was solved at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution. The primary, secondary and tertiary structures of N-CEA are very similar to those of murine and human CEACAM1 (Fedarovich et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2002) . In line with the ability of CEA to dimerize (Taheri et al., 2000; Watt et al., 2001) , we identified contacts within the crystal structure that might represent native, inter-domain interactions. We found that two molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a non-crystallographic two-fold rotation axis. Each molecule in the asymmetric unit participates in two major inter-molecular contacts in this crystal form which suggest physiologically important interactions. One of these (interface I) buries 1622 \u00c5 2 of accessible surface (Lee and Richards, 1971) in forming dimer I ( Figure 1A ). The other (interface II) buries 1407 \u00c5 2 (dimer II) ( Figure 1B ). It has been demonstrated that residues on the GFCC'C\" face of CEACAMs, namely Y34, V39, D40, R43 and Q44, are directly engaged in homophilic cell adhesion (Markel et al., 2004; Taheri et al., 2000; Tan et al., 2002; Watt et al., 2001) . These amino acids are located in interface I, indicating that this interface is involved in the physiological dimer ( Figure 1A ). Further evidence for this assignment is the recognition of similar dimers in other published CEACAM structures. In both murine CEACAM1 (PDB id 1L6Z (Tan et al., 2002) ) and human CEACAM1 (PDB id 2GK2, (Fedarovich et al., 2006) ), crystallographic symmetry operations, when applied to single molecules in the asymmetric units, produce dimers with subunit -subunit interactions very similar to those seen in the N-CEA asymmetric unit.",

Several of these mutations were constructed in our previous study (Korotkova et al., 2006) . To determine the molecular weight (Mw) of N-CEA mutants, the proteins were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. Chromatographic analysis demonstrated that N-CEA at a concentration 50 \u03bcM is predominantly dimeric with a Mw of about 24 kDa. Mutations in interface II ( Figure  1B ) did not alter the dimerization state of N-CEA; however, several N-CEA mutations in interface I ( Figure 1A ) prevented the formation of N-CEA dimers (Table II) . The Mw of these mutants was about 12 kDa (Supplementary Figure S1 ). These results confirm that the proposed homodimer ( Figure 1A ) predicted by interface I in the crystal structure is likely to be the physiologically relevant structure. Interestingly, the substitution H89Q, occurring within the dimerization interface of the CEA homologs CEACAM6 and CEACAM1, did not affect N-CEA dimerization. In contrast, the Q44L substitution identified in the CEACAM6 predicted dimerization interface disrupts N-CEA homophilic interactions, implying that CEACAM6 would display monomeric characteristics.",

These data confirm the results of size exclusion chromatography, demonstrating that interactions between subunits are weak in these mutants.

A 1:1 model of binding fits well to the binding curve of CEA/CEACAM6 interactions with a Kd of \u223c100 \u03bcM, confirming the monomeric status of N-CEACAM6 in solution (data not shown). To test the hypothesis that the dimerization surface of CEA is involved in interactions with other CEACAMs, N-CEACAM6 or N-CEACAM1 were immobilized on the sensor surface, and N-CEA or N-CEA mutants impaired in dimerization served as analytes. As with N-CEA/N-CEA interactions and as expected considering the propensity of the analytes to dimerize, a 1:1 model fits poorly to N-CEA/N-CEACAM1 and N-CEA/N-CEACAM6 binding curves (Supplementary Figure  S4 ). However, when the N-CEA mutants served as analytes, the 1:1 model fits well to the binding curves (Supplementary Figure S4 ). The I91A mutation abolished N-CEA binding to N-CEACAM6 and N-CEACAM1, and the V39A mutation abolished N-CEA binding to N-CEACAM6 (Table III) . These data indicate that the CEA dimerization surface is also involved in interactions with other members of the CEACAM family.",

To further elucidate the N-CEA surface involved in adhesin binding, we analyzed DraE affinity to the newly generated mutants of N-CEA (Table II) . Indeed, N-CEA mutants F29I, I91A and L95A have appreciably lower affinity for DraE (Table II) . Interestingly, N-CEA mutants S32N, V39A (Korotkova et al., 2006) and E99A which demonstrated little dimerization (see above) bound to DraE with affinities comparable to wild type N-CEA (Table II) . Therefore, the mutagenesis data and structural analysis suggest that DraE can recognize both CEA monomers and dimers as binding partners. To fully account for the monomer-dimer equilibrium of N-CEA, SPR experiments were conducted in the buffer used for analytical ultracentrifugation, for which the Kd of CEA self-association is available (0.8 \u03bcM (+0.4/-0.3 \u03bcM)) and can be employed to calculate the concentration of CEA monomers for each aliquot of injected CEA. Surprisingly, a 1:1 stoichiometry fit better to the DraE/CEA binding curves when the total concentration of CEA was employed in the calculation, without regard to the proportion of the protein in the monomeric form (Supplementary Figure S5A ,B). However when we estimated the affinity of N-CEA to the N-CEACAM6immobilized surface, a 1:1 model fit the binding curve only when the calculated monomer concentration was employed, giving a Kd of 65 \u00b17 \u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S5C ,D). This finding suggests that either CEA dimers bind to DraE in a divalent manner with affinity equal to that of monomers, or that DraE efficiently triggers the dissociation of the N-CEA subunits. In each case, the stoichiometry of the complex is 1:1.",

A disulfide bridge between adjacent C39 residues covalently links A and A' subunits as well as B and B' subunits ( Figure 4B ). The A-A' and B-B' dimers use the same interface for homodimerization as was observed in CEA, however they differ slightly in the relative orientations of their monomers by a rotation of approximately 5-10 degrees ( Figure 4B ).

Despite exhaustive attempts to cocrystallize N-CEA with monomeric DraE, no additional electron density was found that could account for the bound adhesin. To date, no crystal structures of any CEACAM in complex with pathogen ligands have been reported. The availability of complete NMR assignments for the highly related AfaE adhesin (98% identical to DraE with similar binding affinity for N-CEA) provides an excellent opportunity to derive the solution structure of the N-CEA/AfaE-dsc complex using NMR methods. Analysis of amide line-widths and chemical shift perturbation (CSP) in 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra of AfaE-dsc in the presence of the N-CEA revealed that many of the interfacial resonances are broadened beyond detection indicating these complexes are in the intermediate exchange limit on the NMR time scale. This precludes use of NOE data for deriving a solution structure of the complex. We adopted a site-directed spin labeling approach, in which paramagnetic centers are introduced at appropriate locations and the induced relaxation enhancements are used to derive intermolecular distances to regions outside the immediate binding site. This method has been recently shown to be very powerful in structure determinations of proteins and protein complexes with limited NOE data (Battiste and Wagner, 2000; Liang et al., 2006) .",

Using this model, N-CEA residue positions were chosen for mutation to cysteine and subsequent coupling to either a paramagnetic or diamagnetic label.

PRE effects were introduced into the structure calculation as distance restraints with \u00b1 4 \u00c5 error. To check for non-specific binding effects, a control mutant (V20C) was chosen that was located over 25 \u00c5 from the predicted binding surface. No paramagnetic effects were observed in the V20C complex. Interestingly, a further mutant, L95C, displayed severely reduced affinity for N-CEA (Table II) and yielded a complex undergoing exchange in the fast limit.

The predicted distance between H27 residues on subunits comprising an N-CEA dimer is about 27 \u00c5.

In agreement with the model for N-CEA, upon dilution of the TMR-labeled CEA dimer over the range of 30 \u03bcM to 15 \u03bcM, the peak at 518 nm was diminished and the 518/555 ratio was 0.64\u00b10.01 (Figure 6 ), indicating a decrease in the dimeric species.

This result was attributed to CEA subunit exchange. Moreover dilution of the labeled protein with DraE triggered a significant decrease in the absorption at 518 nm, which resulted in a 518/555 ratio of 0.48\u00b10.01 ( Figure  6 ). The effect of addition of DraE on dimerization was identical to the effect of addition of urea.

Structural analysis of the N-domain of CEA together with size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrate that N-CEA forms a homodimer with Kd = 0.8 \u03bcM (+0.4/-0.3 \u03bcM). The CEA dimer interface contains a number of hydrophilic and charged amino acids that could potentially form hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Hydrophilic interactions in the subunit-subunit interface involve residues S32, R38, G41, Q44, L95, N97 and E99. In addition, residues F29, V39, and I91 of one subunit make hydrophobic contacts with the equivalent residues on the other subunit. These contacts appear to be critical for the interaction as mutation of F29, S32, V39, Q44, I91, L95 and E99 dramatically reduce the amount of CEA dimerization. The existence of the N-CEA homodimer in solution suggests that CEA occurs as homodimer on the cell surface, which is typical for Ig superfamily members.",

Several mutations preventing CEA dimerization dramatically affected CEA/CEACAM1 and CEA/CEACAM6 interactions, suggesting that the CEA dimer interface is also important for heterophilic interactions. In addition, SPR studies revealed very low CEA/CEACAM6 affinity. This observation is in agreement with the data demonstrating poor cell adherence mediated by CEA/CEACAM6 contacts (Oikawa et al., 2000) . Interestingly, a single mutation of CEA, Q44R, increased CEA/CEACAM6 affinity significantly. This amino acid substitution is present in only one member of the CEACAM family, CEACAM8, a protein expressed in neutrophils and eosinophils . CEACAM8 mediated binding to CEACAM6 in a cell adherence assay , and CEACAM8/CEACAM6 interactions were detected by SPR analysis (N.

The relationship between the two surfaces and the relative positioning of the N-CEA ligands are shown in Figures 5E . All of the mutated residues that affect both interactions are positioned in the shared binding region important in CEA dimerization and Dr adhesin binding. This suggests that Dr adhesins are unable to bind efficiently to CEA dimers as a steric clash would be created with the second N-CEA molecule. Interestingly, the human pathogens N. gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae also bind to CEACAM receptors and residues critical for adherence are also located at the dimer interface (Bos et al., 1999; Villullas et al., 2007) . SPR analysis of a CEA mutant in which dimerization is covalently locked by a disulfide bond revealed that only the CEA monomer is efficiently bound by the Dr adhesin.

Thus, the highly dynamic homophilic interactions of CEACAMs appear to be disrupted by bacterial adhesins despite the similar affinities and fast on/off rates for DraE/CEA complex formation and CEA dimerization. A possible explanation is inherent in the highly polymeric nature of the Dr adhesins; monomeric CEA is first targeted by Dr adhesin and the high local concentration of adhesin subunits present in polymeric fimbriae would enable the adhesin to efficiently out compete CEA self-association. Another possible scenario for this is that Dr adhesin might interact with the CEA dimer with very low affinity causing the dissociation of the CEA dimer to monomers followed by Dr adhesin binding to monomer.",

To create the plasmid for CHO cell transfection, the sequence corresponding to the human CEACAM1-3S (short cytoplasmic domain) sequence was PCR amplified using a cDNA clone as a template and inserted into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) into Nhe I and Age I restriction sites to generate CEACAM1 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the C-terminus (CEACAM1-GFP). Mutations were introduced into the CEA gene on pET-21d plasmid (Korotkova et al., 2006) and CEACAM1 on pEGFP-N1 plasmid (this study) by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change Kit as directed by the manufacturer (Stratagene).

Backbone amide assignments obtained previously were used and reconfirmed at this pH (Anderson et al., 2004) . To improve the solution behavior of N-CEA, L18 and L20 residues were mutated to Ser and Thr, respectively. These changes had no affect on the interaction with AfaE, as tested by NMR and SPR. The chemical shift perturbation studies of AfaE-dsc in the presence of N-CEA were used to design a series of cysteine mutants predicted to be adjacent to the AfaE-dsc/N-CEA interface and able to induce PRE effects when reacted with MTSSL. The single-site mutants chosen were V20C, V39C, R43C, Q54C, T56C and L95C. 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra were recorded in the presence of either MTSL-labeled or dMTSL labeled mutant N-CEA at a 1:1 molar ratio of AfaE-dsc/N-CEA. Intensity ratios were obtained for well-resolved resonances, and PRE distances were deduced using a established method based on the modified Solomon-Bloembergen equation for transverse relaxation (Battiste and Wagner, 2000; Liang et al., 2006) . The distances were corrected for the fraction of bound AfaE-dsc at a 1:1 molar ratio. A cautious estimate for dissociation constants of the mutants was taken to be 20 \u03bcM based on acquired NMR and SPR data. Resonances exhibiting conformational exchange on an intermediate timescale were not used in the analysis. Details of the solution structure for the complex are provided in Supplementary data.
