Some such studies have been conducted among Western travelers; however, to our knowledge, there have been no reports on Japanese travelers. Methods: Malaria cases that were diagnosed between April 1999 and December 2005 and were reported to the national infectious disease surveillance body were used as the numerators after grouped into countries of disease acquisition. The denominators, the numbers of Japanese travelers visiting individual countries were derived from the recipient countries and obtained through a Japanese organization. Results: In addition to the well-documented high risks in sub-Saharan countries, our study showed that travelers to Papua New Guinea were exposed to a significantly high risk of malaria. In Asia, Myanmar had the highest risk. Generally, malaria incidence rates among Japanese travelers were lower than those previously reported on Western travelers. However, the rates were rather comparable to the data obtained recently. Conclusions: These malaria incidence data in travelers should be taken into consideration for pre-travel risk assessment. They need to be constantly updated, and at the same time, limitations in data interpretation that are inherent in various study methodologies should also be clarified. \u00aa a v a i l a b l e a t w w w . s c i e n c e d i r e c t . c o m j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r h e a l t h . c o m / j o u r n a l s / t m i d Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease (2008) 6, 368e372",

However, a high proportion of users report adverse drug events, with a predominance of neuropsychiatric adverse events among mefloquine users. 4 The benefits of chemoprophylaxis use to prevent malaria need to be carefully weighed against the risk of adverse drug events. This is particularly pertinent for travelers from Japan where mefloquine is the only drug licensed for malaria prophylaxis.

Some denominators were derived from home countries of the 9, 10 while others were from recipient countries with data provided by the UNWTO, 11, 12 as with our study. The British 13, 14 and Swedish 15 studies estimated travel volume to a specific country/area using passenger surveys conducted at international airports and telephone interviews, respectively. These approaches benefited from larger sample sizes (numerator and denominator data) and greater diagnostic accuracy of malaria, as the infections were confirmed after returning home. However, illnesses that occurred abroad are not captured, and the effect of length of stay may not be evaluated due to lack of data. Furthermore, the incidence rates could be greatly influenced by chemoprophylaxis use in high-risk groups, and this could not be assessed in these studies. Although differences in study methodologies make it difficult to compare results across the various studies, relative infection risks between destination countries or areas could be derived from individual studies. This information is invaluable when making malaria chemoprophylaxis recommendations for travelers. This is particularly true for Japanese travelers as no country-specific data have previously been acquired to assess the risk of malaria for these travelers.",

It is also noted that our country-specific rates were generally lower than those obtained for Western travelers; rates in Japanese travelers to Nigeria and Ghana were several to 10-fold less than those of British, 13 Italian, 10 and Danish 11 travelers. Recently, however, Steffen et al. 16 showed the 10-fold decreased malaria incidence rate among travelers to Tropical Africa (200 per 100,000 per month of stay) than previously reported, some of whom were on chemoprophylaxis. Our current results are rather comparable to those new data. The low incidence rate in Kenya was unexpected and far lower than that of British travelers (8.0 per 100,000 compared with 149 per 100,000) 13 or Danish travelers (245.9 per 100,000), 11 although it was similar to the rate reported among Italian travelers (9.0 per 100,000). 10 This may be because Japanese travelers tend to visit safari parks which may pose a lower risk than visits to coastal areas such as Mombassa. In fact, visits to game parks in Kenya were found to be 4.7-fold lower risk than visits to the coast and 14.3-fold lower risk than to Lake Victoria. 8 In line with the Australian (723.5 per 100,000) 9 and US (only bars but not exact figures were shown) 12 studies, we demonstrated a high incidence rate among travelers to Papua New Guinea (142.3 per 100,000) e comparable to those in sub-Saharan Africa. The British study also showed a very high rate in Oceania (4100 per 100,000), with most cases occurring after visits to Papua New Guinea. 13 In addition, the Australian study reported even a greater risk in the Solomon Islands than Papua New Guinea. 9 In our study, however, we could not accurately assess the risk in the Solomon Islands as denominator data were only available for three of the study years. Based on these data, an estimated 1600 travelers visited this country during the study period and six malaria cases (two P. falciparum, four P. vivax infections) were reported, giving an incidence rate of 375.0 per 100,000 travelers. We found that 70% of malaria cases acquired in Papua New Guinea were due to P. vivax, with 27% due to P. falciparum. Even if considering the lower proportion of P. falciparum infections, chemoprophylaxis may be recommended for travelers to this region of Oceania, as long as it is recommended for travel to sub-Saharan Africa.",

Limited prescribing of malaria chemoprophylaxis for travelers to the Indian Subcontinent 17 and Latin America 18 has been proposed by European groups, because of the low incidence of malaria and low risk of travelers acquiring P. falciparum infection. Our study results provide support for this recommendation. Although previous studies have shown that among Asian countries, the risk of malaria is high in India and the Indian Subcontinent, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 our study showed the highest risk in Myanmar, which may have not been previously documented. Similar to previous studies, 9, 11, 12 the risk of malaria in Thailand was lower than in Indonesia, both being Asian countries attracting an enormous number of tourists worldwide.",

Nevertheless, such data on the incidence of malaria in travelers are invaluable in helping to define the risk and chemoprophylaxis recommendations. These data need to be constantly updated and at the same time, such studies should clearly outline limitations in data interpretation that are inherent in various methodologies.",
