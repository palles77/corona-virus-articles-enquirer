We report MERS-CoV data from 5065 Kingdom of Saudi Arabia individuals who were screened for MERS-CoV over a 12-month period. From 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2013, demographic and clinical data were prospectively collected from all laboratory forms received at the Saudi Arabian Virology reference laboratory. Data were analysed by referral type, age, gender, and MERS-CoV real-time PCR test results. Five thousand and 65 individuals were screened for MER-CoV: hospitalized patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection (n = 2908, 57.4%), healthcare worker (HCW) contacts (n = 1695; 33.5%), and family contacts of laboratory-confirmed MERS cases (n = 462; 9.1%). Eleven per cent of persons tested were children (<17 years of age). There were 108 cases (99 adults and nine children) of MERS-CoV infection detected during the 12-month period (108/5065, 2% case detection rate). Of 108 cases, 45 were females (six children and 39 adults) and 63 were males (three children and 60 adults). Of the 99 adults with MERS-CoV infection, 70 were hospitalized patients, 19 were HCW contacts, and ten were family contacts. There were no significant increases in MERS-CoV detection rates over the 12-month period: 2.patients had a significantly higher MERS-CoV infection rate (63/2318, 2.7%) than females (45/2747, 1.6%) (p 0.013). MERS-CoV rates remain at low levels, with no significant increase over time. Pro-active surveillance for MERS-CoV in newly diagnosed patients and their contacts will continue.",

Contact-tracing activities allow for the detection of confirmed cases with a broader spectrum of illness. For infectious diseases caused by viruses, confirmed cases include only those with a positive PCR test result for viral genetic material, in accordance with the laboratory guidelines. Since the first case report of the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in September 2012 [1] , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) Ministry of Health (KSA-MoH) has been working closely with international collaborators and the WHO to better understand and define the epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory features of the new disease. A molecular real-time PCR diagnostic test was rapidly developed after the first case, and was subsequently the method recommended by the WHO for detecting the presence of the MERS-CoV infection [2, 3] . This test was used in a retrospective analysis on biobanked samples to confirm two cases of MERS from an earlier outbreak of respiratory infection in Jordan in April, 2012 [4] .",

Surveillance studies also help in defining and monitoring transmission rates, case load, and epidemic risk assessment, and assist in instituting infection control measures with new diagnostic methods and treatments. Although MERS-CoV case detection is critically dependent on the degree of awareness of the attending physician, accurate laboratory testing is also essential in making a diagnosis. Soon after the detection of the first case of MERS in Jeddah in September 2012 [1] , the KSA-MoH put in place a proactive surveillance and screening programme for inpatients admitted with respiratory illness suspected of being caused by MERS-CoV. It also included active screening of contacts of confirmed MERS cases. KSA-MoH recommendations for MERS-CoV screening are based on the WHO guidelines on case definition, detection, and contact investigations [5] [6] [7] . This led to an increase in the numbers of requests for MERS-CoV screening from hospitals throughout the KSA. We report these laboratory data on the use of realtime PCR tests on clinical samples received from 5065 individuals screened for MERS-CoV during a 12-month period, commencing from the first case detection in September 2012.",

Clinical samples were screened by real-time PCR, as previously described [6] , with amplification targeting both upE and ORF 1A for confirmation-these are standard assay used in the KSA for MERS-CoV testing.

This is the largest study describing the incidence rates of MERS-CoV in the KSA over a period of 12 months. The real-time PCR MERS-CoV diagnostic test has been in use for detecting new MERS cases in hospitalized patients, and for screening of HCW and family contacts of confirmed MERS cases [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Six months after MERS-CoV was discovered, at the end of March 2013, there were only 17 MERS-CoV cases reported globally, nine of which were from the KSA [12] . In light of the infrequent, but continuing, detection of sporadic MERS-CoV cases in the community and the hospital outbreak at Al-Hasa [10] , the WHO constituted an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to advise the Director-General on the status of the MERS-CoV situation [13] . The important issue at that time was whether MERS-CoV was going to progress to cause a major pandemic, as did the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s, which was also caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV [14] .",

Our results provide an estimate of a rate of 3.6% for acquisition of MERS-CoV from close family contacts. However, this finding is not conclusive, as no serological assays were utilized for screening mild or subclinical cases. However, the finding is in agreement with previous observations of low secondary attack rates among family members or contacts of patients in the KSA and European countries [8, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The third transmission pattern is nosocomial transmission to HCWs. In one study, seven HCWs with MERS-CoV infection were reported. Two of them were asymptomatic, and five had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms [11] . The current study sheds more light on the transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare setting. The positivity rate of MERS-CoV by PCR was only 1.12% of all tested HCWs. Transmission within healthcare settings was retrospectively reported from Jordan [4] , and then subsequently reported in France, the KSA, the UK, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, and included HCWs treating MERS-CoV patients [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . These data suggest that the current risk of transmission within healthcare facilities remains small, and that the recommended infection control measures are adequate [6, 9, 13, 20] .",

            "text": "The fact that we have subsequently identified milder or asymptomatic cases of MERS in HCWs, children and family members of contacts of MERS cases indicates that the severe cases represent only the tip of the iceberg, and there is a spectrum of milder clinical disease that requires definition. Our data indicate that MERS-CoV affects both genders, and, although a few cases of MERS-CoV in children have been detected, it remains mainly a disease of adults across all age groups. To date, there is still no evidence of sustained community transmission. Despite extensive investigation and testing of thousands of contacts by the KSA-MoH, only a few instances of transmission to HCWs or family contacts have been identified. Almost all patients who died or who had been hospitalized had severe disease or other comorbidities [9, 10] . The mortality rate and severity of disease are exaggerated to some degree by the detection of such cases. The case-fatality rate has fallen in recent months, owing to the detection of milder and asymptomatic cases [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The most critical characteristic of pandemic MERS-CoV strains would be progression to efficient human-to-human transmission. The number of sporadic MERS cases being reported has been small, and indicates that the virus appears to be not readily capable of rapid human-to-human transmission. Two million pilgrims from over 180 countries, and 1 million local KSA pilgrims, have very recently visited Makkah and Madinah, KSA to perform the 2013 annual Hajj pilgrimage, and have returned home after stays of between 2 and 8 weeks [28] . Millions of others will visit the KSA throughout the year for the mini-pilgrimage UMRAH, and although MERS-CoV infection rates in the KSA remain at steady, low levels, and no significant increase in the incidence of MERS-CoV infection over time is occurring, pro-active surveillance for MERS-CoV in newly diagnosed patients and their contacts will continue. The availability of more rapid and accurate serological tests will help to better define the community prevalence of MERS-CoV.",
