A sequence homology of greater than 96 per cent was observed between the 6.8 Md species from the two viruses.

Both agglutinate erythrocytes from mice, rats, and chickens (10, 15, 19) , and both share antigens as determined by immunofluorescence (20) . No biological or structural data exists to rigorously differentiate between these viruses. Because a significant fraction of the human population (7 to 69 per cent) both in Europe and the United States carry antibodies that are able to neutralize, immunoprecipitate, and indirectly immunofluoresce the bovine coronavirus (22) , the possibility exists that tile bovine corona~drus and the human coronavirus 0C43 are two names for the same virus with zoonotic potential.",

For BCV we have shown this to be intravirion, polyadenylated, and subgenomic. Its function is unknown. It was not detected in earlier studies on BCV that, employed 3H-uridine for labeling periods of less than 48 hours (7) . Since our studies here use labeling periods of greater than 48 hours it is possible that the 0.68 \u00d7 106 M.W. species becomes incorporated only late in infection and may represent adventitious encapsidation of a viral subgenomic messenger ]~NA of the type described for several coronaviruses (4, 12, 21) . Further studies are needed to confirm this interpretat, ion.",
