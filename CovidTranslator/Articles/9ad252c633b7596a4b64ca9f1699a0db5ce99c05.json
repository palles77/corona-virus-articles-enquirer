In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65\u00d710 9 /L vs. 0.76\u00d710 9 /L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.",

Over the past two decades,CP therapy was successfully used in the treatment of SARS, MERS, and 2009 H1N1 pandemic with satisfactory efficacy and safety (9) (10) (11) (12) . A meta-analysis from 32 studies of SARS coronavirus infection and severe influenza showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following CP therapy, compared with placebo or no therapy (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.45) (13) . However, the CP therapy was unable to significantly improve the survival in the Ebola virus disease, probably due to the absence of data of neutralizing antibodytitrationfor stratified analysis (14) . Since the virological and clinical characteristics share similarity among SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 (15) , CP therapy might be a promising treatment option for COVID-19 rescue (16) . Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 with a high neutralizing antibody titermay bea valuable donor source of CP. Nevertheless, the potential clinical benefit and risk of convalescent blood products in COVID-19 remains uncertain. Hence, we performed this pilot study in three participated hospitals to explore the feasibility of CPtreatment in 10 severe COVID-19 patients.",

A small sample study in MERS-CoV infection showed that the neutralizing antibody titer should exceed 1:80 to achieve effective CP therapy (12) . To find eligible donors who have high levels of neutralizing antibody is a prerequisite. Cao (23) et al showed that the level of specific neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV decreased gradually 4 months after the disease process, reaching undetectable levels in 25.6% (IgG) and 16.1% (neutralizing antibodies) of patients at 36 months after disease status. A study from the MERS-CoV infected patients and the exposed healthcare workers showed that the prevalence of MERS-CoVIgGseroreactivity was very low (2.7%), and the antibodies titer decreased rapidly within 3 months (24) . These studies suggested that the neutralizing antibodies represented short-lasting humoral immune response and plasma from recently recovered patients should be more effective. In the present study, recently recovered COVID-19 patients, who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 with neutralizing antibody titer above 1:640and recruited from local hospitals should be considered as suitable donors. The median age of donors was lower than that of recipients (42.0 vs. 52.5 years). Among the nine cases investigated, the neutralizing antibody titers of five patients increased while four patients kept the same level to 1:640 within two days. The antibody titers in CP in COVID-19 seem thus higher than those used in the treatment of MERS patient (1:80) (12) .",

Representative chest CT images of patient 9 and patient 10 were shown on Fig. 1. Patient 9, a 49-year-old female admitted on 1 day post onset of illness (dpoi), showed the most obvious pulmonary image improvement. On 10 dpoi, one dose of 200 mL transfusion of CP was given. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA converted to negative on 12 dpoi. Compared with the result on 7 dpoi, massive infiltration and ground-glass attenuation disappeared on CT image performed on 13 dpoi, accompanied bya much better pulmonary function. Patient 10, a 50-year-old male, was admitted on 3 dpoi and was given a 200 mL transfusion of CP on 20 dpoi. His chest CT presented massive infiltration and widespread ground-glass attenuation on admission andstarted to show a gradual absorption of lung lesions 5 days after CP transfusion. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA became negative on 25 dpoi.
