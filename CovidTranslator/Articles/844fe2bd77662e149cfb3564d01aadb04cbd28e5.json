We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age \u226518years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5-21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). Results: We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group ( p < 0 \u00b705). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52 \u00b79%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected ( p < 0 \u00b705). The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group ( p < 0 \u00b705). Conclusion: In patients with COVID-19, the apparent favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] So far, the infection keeps spreading, and more and more exported cases were confirmed in other provinces in China, and other countries. Indicating that the disease is a serious threat to global health. 5, 6 The management of patients with COVID-19 consists of a combination of supportive measures, antimicrobial therapy for any associated bacterial or viral infections, and strict implementation of appropriate infection control precautions. [1] [2] [3] [4] The number of this disease is still multiplying, and effective antiviral treatment is therefore required urgently. 5, 6 It has been hypothesized that the immunopathological response was triggered by the viral antigen; the most strategic treatment was, therefore, to stop the viral replication at the beginning so that the peak viral load and the subsequent immunopathological damage will be minimised. 7 We report the findings of Results and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 that compare a combination of arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) against LPV/r only. Placebo-controlled studies are difficult to perform in an epidemic of such a lifethreatening condition. 7",

It had been reviewed that although the glucocorticoid group was younger and had fewer underlying diseases, it had more adverse outcomes, increasing the risk of ICU admission and mortality for patients with SARS receiving hormone therapy. 22 Glucocorticoids could delay the clearance of coronavirus nucleic acids without lower mortality for patients with MERS-CoV infection. 23 One of the limitations of our study is its small size. Our review, albeit little, is the most significant clinical investigation so far to assess the use of this combination in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Although baseline characteristics of our treatment and comparator groups seem to be reasonably balanced, substantial differences might not be apparent because of the small number of patients in the study. Our review is also limited by its retrospective, nonrandomized nature, Inevitably, selection and unmeasured confounding bias cannot be excluded entirely. There could be a few alternative interpretations of the results. Undoubtedly, new interventions should ideally be assessed in randomized, controlled clinical trials. However, such an approach is generally accepted to not always be practically feasible in the context of an emerging and relatively uncommon disease such as MERS-CoV infection at the very beginning. 24 We selected our control group carefully, ensuring that the two cohorts were matched as closely as possible in their clinical characteristics, treatment interventions, and chest CT images other than the receipt of arbidol and LPV/r. We removed four individuals be admitted and transferred to the ICU who had organ dysfunction outlying baseline serum creatinine from the comparator group to minimize the risk of any spurious conclusions driven by clinical characteristics that might be potentially detrimental to clinical outcome.
