The United States realized significant health gains in the past century; however, significant challenges remain. For decades, we have not done enough about our unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity, and other poor choices that negatively impact our individual and societal health.",

The patient-provider relationship has also changed to encompass a shared decision-making process that is dependent on strong health literacy skills and coordination among a team of multidisciplinary health professionals.",

The influential leadership of William Osler focused the training of health professionals in large, centralized medical centers. 2 The release of the Flexner Report 3 spurred the standardization of medical education and the formation of various accreditation organizations. Ultimately, all health profession training programs were standardized, with periodic reviews to maintain accreditation status. In addition, advances in technology, basic science research, and medical and surgical interventions took a reductionist view of disease management with an emphasis on highly trained specialists to treat organ-specific diseases. Together, these events formed the foundation for contemporary health professions education with a primary focus on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The role of prevention is rarely emphasized.",

They were acting to meet the following Healthy People 2010 5 objective: \"Increase the proportion of schools of medicine, schools of nursing, and other health professional training schools whose basic curriculum for healthcare providers includes the core competencies in health promotion and disease prevention.\"",

The timeliness and importance of this curriculum are reflected in its unanimous acceptance by the representatives of all seven disciplines in the consortium. We know that prevention makes sense, that it works, and that it can be cost-effective. Several federal programs address prevention, including the development of national health objectives (Healthy People 5 ), evidence-based prevention guidelines (Guide to Clinical Preventive Services 6 and Guide to Community Preventive Services 7 ), and integrated community interventions that address the burden of chronic disease (President's HealthierUS initiative 8 ). Further support through funding, policy development, and educational programming will strengthen our ability to protect and advance the health of all Americans. These efforts, combined with the widespread implementation of a prevention curriculum, will help move U.S. health professions and the society in a healthier direction.",
