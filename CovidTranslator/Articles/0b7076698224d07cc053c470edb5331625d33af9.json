Boom technology has been play a gold standard role for several decades, which uses chaotropic salt and organic solvent like ethanol and propanol for cell lysis, protein removal, and nucleic acid adsorption. Other methods such as SPRI (Solid Phase Reverse Immobilization) and CST (Charge Switch Technology), not using chaotropic salts were also employed to achieve target nucleic acids by impurity removal and target adsorption [14] [15] [16] . As a result, target nucleic acids are concentrated in small clean solution without any impurities and their performances could be evaluated by total recovery rate, concentration, purities against protein and solvent. To achieve three purposes (high recovery rate, high concentration rate, and high purity) these methods have same basic processes (Binding step, washing step, and Elution step) by high speed centrifuge or vacuum based solution replacement methods even though surface and buffer are replaced from each other 17 . It implies these could not be applied on in-field test.",

It means direct buffer can make nucleic acid to be amplified somewhat by impurities detachment. Due to this simplicity, direct buffers have been focused for the in-field diagnostic system even though PCR sensitivity over 10-fold decreases because impurities are not removed and sample is diluted by adding buffer. To develop direct buffer, chemicals composed in solution does not have any inhibition for next process, PCR. By literature searches, various chemicals such as PEG (PolyEthylene glycol), Kosmotropic salt, Sodium Chloride, detergent, NaOH, Divalent Cation, and Chaotropic salt have been employed to direct buffer for reduction of PCR inhibition effect of blood impurities 20, 21 .

In particular, SDS acts as a strong inhibitor of PCR reactions at concentrations greater than 0.01%. This is probably due to the fact that strong anion-like SDS is adsorbed on the surface of the polymerase used in the PCR to inhibit the enzyme reaction. This assumption can be proven in Figure 2 (a) that Triton X does not inhibit any PCR reactions up to 1% concentration.

Notable results show that for PEG 8000, 10% PCR efficiency was achieved even with 100% PEG 8000 sample, although the PCR reaction was inhibited at higher concentrations. Comparisons of PCR inhibition of chaotropic salt and kosmotropic salt were also very interesting. In general, chaotropic salt, which increases the solubility of proteins by changing the three-dimensional structure of proteins, is known to be a strong inhibitor of PCR, while Kosmotropic salt promotes the aggregation of proteins, it is known that there is a property of lowering the solubility. However, according to the result shown in Figure 2 (c) of investigation of PCR efficiency, sodium sulfate has higher PCR inhibition ability than guanidium thiocyanate. NaOH is closely related to pH. 50 mM NaOH has a pH of about 13, and when it meets the PCR buffer, it is judged that the PCR is possible because the pH is 9 to 10. Therefore, in the case of NaOH, when the PCR buffer concentration is increased, the inhibition of the PCR reaction is expected to be somewhat resolved. In the case of MgCl2, the inhibition of the polymerase reaction may be caused by the properties of Mg 2+ . The inhibition of PCR by Mg 2+ could also be solved to some extent by changing the composition of PCR buffer. Therefore, the proper concentration ranges of each chemicals to get main and combinatory effects on DNA recovery and PCR efficiency with whole blood were obtained as represented in Figure 2 (a)-(d) (0-1.25% of PEG 200, 0-20% of PEG 8000, 0-0.01% of SDS, 0-1.0% of Triton X, 0-100 mM of GuSCN, 0-50 mM of Na2SO4, 0-50 mM of NaOH, and 0-10 mM of MgCl2).",

The presence of free nucleic acids can be obtained by two measurement methods. One is to measure the direct sample PCR efficiency and the other is to dilute the solution to eliminate the influence of inhibitors and obtain PCR efficiency (so called diluted sample PCR). The amount of nucleic acid and the amount of impurities involved in the PCR sample can be deduced by comparing the direct sample PCR results (depending on the both of nucleic acid amount and impurities amount) with the diluted sample PCR results (depending on the only nucleic amount). Design of Experiments (DOE) based on ANOVA was performed to identify the main effects and combinatory effects of candidate substances on PCR efficiency using blood. The sample used was whole blood from 4 individuals, and the volumetric ratio of blood sample to direct buffer used was 1 : 2. Target DNA (usually not existed in the blood) was spiked in the samples. Figure 3 (a) and (b) represented main effect of candidate materials on the PCR efficiency. In case of PEG 200, the presence of PEG 200 (1.25% in the buffer solution) increase direct sample PCR efficiency (Ct was decreased) whereas no effect of PEG 200 was found in diluted sample PCR result. This result shows that PEG 200 reduces the PCR inhibition of whole blood without affecting the nucleic acid involved in the PCR. From these results, it can be concluded that PEG 200 prevents the adsorption of various ions (heme, etc.) and proteins (immunoglobin, etc.) to the nucleic acid.",

This is interpreted to mean that the concentration of Mg 2+ used to remove impurities or concentrate the nucleic acid is too low. This interpretation can be applied to the fact that GuSCN, the representative chaotropic salt, and Na2SO4, the kosmotropic salt, have a small effect on the PCR efficiency. However, in the case of GuSCN, it is unusual to have a negative effect on PCR efficiency in direct sample PCR. Despite the use of concentrations (50 mM) that did not affect PCR, we can find that PCR efficiency decreases when GuSCN is present. This suggests that GuSCN, a chaotropic salt, increases the PCR inhibition ability of whole blood (Diluted sample PCR results, Figure 3(b) , showed that the amount of nucleic acid involved in PCR did not decrease).",

Direct sample PCR results show very little PCR efficiency, but diluted sample PCR results shows that PCR efficiency is greatly increased. This result means that NaOH does not remove whole blood impurities, but it increases the amount of nucleic acid that can participate in the PCR reaction. This is probably because NaOH is added to the buffer, and the pH of the sample is increased, and various biological substances such as nucleic acid and protein become highly negatively charged, thereby the adsorption between various biological substances is hindered. This result has a very important meaning. This demonstrates that inhibition of PCR reaction of whole blood is due not only to the presence of inhibitors such as heme or immunoglobin but also to the binding with nucleic acids. Therefore, it is considered that the direct PCR target can be achieved by simply raising the pH and removing the impurities themselves.",

Only the binary combinatory effect was examined here. As shown in the Figure 3(c) and (d) , direct sample PCR efficiency and diluted sample PCR efficiency were investigated according to the combination of each candidate substance. In most cases, there is no difference from the main effect, but some materials such as PEG 8000, detergent, and GuSCN can be seen to change their properties depending on the material being combined. First, the effect of NaOH seems to be negligible in the absence of PEG 200 in direct sample PCR. However, the results of the diluted sample PCR show that the effect of NaOH is very high regardless of the presence of PEG 200. This suggests that PEG 200 has an impurity refining effect. In other words, the amount of nucleic acid that can be involved in PCR is increased by NaOH (according to the diluted sample PCR result), but in the absence of PEG 200, the effect is very small (according to the direct sample PCR result). It implies PEG 200 is one of the key materials for direct buffers like NaOH. The presence of PEG 8000 also appears to have a positive effect on direct sample PCR. However, the change in PEG 8000 characteristics with pH is completely contrary to the results of direct sample PCR and diluted sample PCR. According to the diluted sample PCR result with PEG 8000 and NaOH, diluted sample PCR efficiency by NaOH increases with or without PEG 8000. However, direct sample PCR results show that when PEG 8000 is present, NaOH adversely affects PCR. In the presence of PEG 8000, the efficiency of the diluted sample PCR is lowered. Therefore, PEG 8000 is considered to have an effect of reducing the concentration of the nucleic acid in the solution as well as the purification effect of impurities (Nucleic acid precipitation).",

These results suggest that PEG 8000 precipitates or coagulates the nucleic acid. However, nucleic acid and impurities affecting the PCR are thought to precipitate or coagulate together. The phenomenon of impurity removal can be confirmed by the following photograph. As the amount of PEG 8000 increases, the longer the reaction time, the more the color of the whole blood changes to the color of the serum (It can be confirmed that the heme molecules disappear).

However, it has also severe drawback because it is strong PCR inhibitor itself. To remove chaotropic salt in mixture, centrifugal force is usually utilized. However, in real clinical field, this simple equipment can't be used. Therefore, direct buffer is quite important even though PCR efficiency is lower than normal sample preparation method.

The viruses were infected to HEK 293 cells for 2 days, and viruses were obtained by freeze-thaw cycling. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.Louis, MO, USA). Sample PCR and Diluted Sample PCRThe DNA spiked to whole blood was genomic DNA of Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), which were cultivated at 37\u00b0C under 3% Tryptic soy broth (TSB, Becton, France) in shaking incubator (Biofree, Seoul, Korea) at 150 rpm. Various direct buffer was mixed with whole blood (2 : 1 volume ratio). Direct sample PCR used mixtures (spiked whole blood and direct buffer) as sample directly. Diluted sample PCR used 1000 times diluted mixtures (with TE buffers) as sample. Forward primer of Salmonella DNA is 5\u2032-CTCAC GGGACGCGAAAAGACGA-3\u2032 and the reverse primer is 5\u2032-CGACGCCGGATTCCCCTACCAG-3\u2032.
