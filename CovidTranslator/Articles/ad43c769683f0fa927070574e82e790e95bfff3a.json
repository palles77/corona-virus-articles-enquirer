In this study, 5 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against the PEDV N-protein were prepared and identified. Three new epitopes, 56 QIRWRMRRGERI 67 , 318 GYAQIASLAPNVAALLFGGNVA VRE 342 and 398 HEEAIYDDV 406 , were firstly identified in the viral N-protein, by using McAbs 3F10, 6A11, and 1C9. The epitope 398 HEEAIYDDV 406 was deleted in SH strain (isolated by our lab) and different between CV777 and YZ strain (isolated by our lab). To study the characters of this epitope, four peptides were synthesized according to the sequence of SH and CV777 and used in the study. The result showed that the 398 th amino acid maybe an important amino acid of the epitope. Biological information analysis showed that the three B cell linear epitopes are highly conserved among different PEDV isolates. In addition, McAb 1C9, which attached to the epitope 398 HEEAIYDDV 406 , showed variant reactivity with PEDV CV777, SH, YZ and MS strains. McAb 1C9 reacted with PEDV strains CV777 and YZ, but not with SH which had a deletion from 399 to 410 amino acids in N-protein (No. MK841494). Among the three McAbs, 6A11, 3F10 and 1C9, only 6A11 reacted with porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in immunofluorescence assay, therefore the other two could be used to distinguish TGEV and PEDV. These mAbs and their defined epitopes may provide useful tool for the study of the PEDV N-protein structure and function, and facilitate the development of diagnostic methods for PEDV.",

The whole genome of PEDV is 28,033 nt, with a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), at least 7 open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2 through 6), and a 3'UTR (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . ORF1a and 1b encode non-structural proteins (nsps), ORF3 encodes one nonstructural accessory protein (ORF3, 27 kDa) and the remaining ORFs code for four major structural proteins including the spike protein (S,180\u2212220 kDa), the envelope protein (E,7 kDa), the membrane protein (M,27\u221232 kDa), and the nucleocapsid protein (N,55\u221258 kDa) from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 (Song and Park, 2012; Duarte et al., 1993; Huang et al., 2013; Kocherhans et al., 2001) .

            "text": "The N-protein of coronavirus is a highly conserved structural protein and the predominant antigen produced in coronavirus infected cells (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . The N protein of SARS CoV is abundantly released in the patients' blood in the course of early infection, suggesting that the N protein is a suitable candidate for diagnostic applications (Zhang et al., 2011) . N protein also can be used as the target for the accurate and early diagnosis of PEDV infection (Song and Park, 2012) . N-protein epitopes play an important role in cellular immunity induction (Saif, 1993) , thus can be used for the development of PED vaccines. However, there are only few studies on the PEDV Nprotein epitopes, focusing on N1-10 (18-133) and N2-10 (252-262) . In a recent study, Lin and C.M et al., found crossreaction based N-protein epitope in the antisera of PEDV and TGEV. They concluded that more crossover epitopes may be present in the Nprotein (Lin et al., 2015) . Ma et al., demonstrated two-way cross reactivity between PEDV and porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in the conserved epitope (s) of N-protein . Therefore it is of great significance to establish a rapid and accurate diagnosis method to study and analyze the antigenicity of the PEDV N-protein.",

McAb 1C9 reacts with the truncated proteins C/C2 and the oligopeptide C2-2 (395-406aa) and C2-3 (398-409aa), indicating that the 398 HEEAIYDDV 406 (named NEP-1C9) was the exact epitope (Fig. 3C) . The 3H8 and 3H10 did not react with the truncated protein but reacted with PEDV CV777 and the N-protein expressed in eukaryotic cells, signifying that they may recognize conformational epitopes of the N-protein.",

            "text": "At present, studies on epitopes mainly focus on S-protein and N-protein. PEDV S-protein, a glycoprotein on the PEDV surface, can be divided into S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit participates in receptor recognition and is an important determinant of PEDV virulence (Suzuki et al., 2018) , while S2 mediates virus-cell membrane fusion during entry. The S-protein contains multiple neutralizing epitopes and has been utilized for PEDV vaccine development and diagnostic reagents (Suzuki et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2002; Cruz et al., 2008; Li et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2008 ). An S-protein based ELISA was established and proved better than an N-protein based ELISA (Knuchel et al., 1992) . However, the S-protein has great variability (Sun et al., 2008; Hain et al., 2016; Oh et al., 2014) . Further, the neutralizing McAb of the protein could not inactivate PEDV strain with other genotype . The high heterogeneity of the S1 protein among PEDV isolates within and between genogroups limits the sensitivity of S-protein-based assays in the field (Lin et al., 2015) . The N-protein of PEDV, the most abundant viral protein expressed in the infected cells, is highly conserved among PEDV genogroups (96-99.7 % amino acid identity). Compared to other porcine coronaviruses, the amino acid similarity of the PEDV N-protein is lower than 35 %. PEDV N-protein can be detected early in the virus infection and is an ideal antigen for serological diagnosis (Lee and Yeo, 2003) . However, the epitopes of N-protein are highly conserved among the family Coronaviridae and cross-epitopes with certain TGEV strains have been reported (Lin et al., 2015) . The study of the N-protein specific epitopes is conducive to development of correct and rapid clinical diagnostic methods to distinguish from TGEV and effective vaccination, but currently there are few studies on epitope of N-protein. To our knowledge, only the epitopes N1-10 (18-133aa) and N2-10 (252-262aa) in the N-protein have been reported Lee and Yeo, 2003) . Shi et al. found that the 148-294aa of PEDV N-protein interactded with nucleolar phosphoprotein (NPM1) (Shi et al., 2017) . In this study, using purified PEDV as antigen, five McAbs recognizing PEDV were screened through hybridoma technology. To confirm the specificity of the monoclonal antibody, the N, M, S1 and S2 protein expressed in prokaryotic cells were also used as coating antigen of ELISA. The results shown that these monoclonal antibody could not recognize M and S protein and three recognized N protein. To further confirm the specificity of the monoclonal antibody, N protein expressed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells were used as antigen in western blot. The results shown that two of the McAbs, 3H8 and 3H10, reacted with Nprotein expressed by baculovirus expression system, but did not bind to N-protein expressed in the prokaryotic expression system. And the other X. Wang, et al. Virus Research 281 (2020) 197912 three McAbs, 3F10, 1C9, and 6A11, recognized N-protein expressed in both baculovirus expression system and in the prokaryotic expression system. The results indicated that 3H8 and 3H10 specifically recognized the conformational epitope instead of the linearized epitope. 3F10, 1C9, and 6A11 recognized the linearized epitopes. Using iELISA and western blot, three epitopes, 56 QIRWRMRRGERI 67 , 398 HEEAIYDDV 406 and 318 GYAQIASLAPNVAALLFGGNVAVRE 342 were recognized by the McAb 3F10, 1C9, and 6A11, respectively. NEP-3F10 was included in N1-10, consistent with previous reports . The two novel epitopes, NEP-1C9, and NEP-6A11 were firstly identified.",

The result showed that 3F10 and 1C9 only recognized PEDV, but 6A11 recognized both PEDV and TGEV, consistent with the result of the alignment of the epitopes amino acid sequences. The epitope 318 GYAQIASLAPNVAALLFGGNVAVRE 342 had high homology with amino acids in this position of TGEV, explaining why monoclonal antibodies reacted with TGEV. According to these results, it was speculated that 1C9 and 3F10 may be used as the candidate antibody to develop diagnostic method to distinguish PEDV or PEDV and TGEV.",

To study the effect of this amino acid on antigenicity of the epitope 398 HEEAIY-DDV 406 , four synthesized polypeptides were designed according to the sequence of different strains and were used as coating antigen for iELISA. The results showed that the 1C9 recognized the polypeptide II in which the amino acid residue His 398 was changed to Nsp 398 , but did not recognize the polypeptide I, III and IV. In other studies, the sera from mice inoculated with inactive PEDV YZ and SH strain were collected and used in this study. The results demonstrated that the OD 450 of the YZ-sera reacted with peptide IV was the highest compared with polypeptide I, II and III. Because there is a gene deletion of 399-410Aa in N-protein of SH strain, the SH-sera did not react with the peptide. These results indicated that NEP-1C9 can induce humoral immune response in which the first amino acid of NEP-1C9 played an important role.",

Meanwhile, two novel epitopes 398 HEEAIYDDV 406 and 318 GYAQIASLAPNVAALLFGGNVA-VRE 342 were reported. The present study may provide useful tools for PEDV N-protein structure and function exploration and facilitate the development of diagnostic method and subunit vaccines against PEDV infection. ",
