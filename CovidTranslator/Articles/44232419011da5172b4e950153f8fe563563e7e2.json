The most compelling reasons to develop rVSV as a vaccine vector include a very low seroprevalence in humans, the ability to infect and robustly express foreign antigens in a broad range of cells, and vigorous growth in continuous cell lines used for vaccine manufacture. Numerous preclinical studies with rVSV vectors expressing antigens from a variety of human pathogens have demonstrated the versatility, flexibility, and potential efficacy of the rVSV vaccine platform. When administered to nonhuman primates (NHPs), rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag and Env elicited robust HIV-1specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and animals immunized with rVSV vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag and HIV Env were protected from AIDS after challenge with a pathogenic SIV/HIV recombinant. However, results from an exploratory neurovirulence study in NHPs indicated that these prototypic rVSV vectors might not be adequately attenuated for widespread use in human populations. To address this safety concern, a variety of different attenuation strategies, designed to produce a range of further attenuated rVSV vectors, are currently under investigation. Additional modifications of further attenuated rVSV vectors to upregulate expression of HIV-1 antigens and coexpress molecular adjuvants are also being developed in an effort to balance immunogenicity and attenuation.",

Many vesiculoviruses have been recovered in nature from bloodsucking insects [17, 102, 107, 109] and bite transmission of VSV IND and Chandipura to laboratory animals by experimentally infected mosquitoes and sandflies has been demonstrated [6, 46, 80, 103, 105, 109] . In addition, natural infection has occurred in sentinel animals exposed in areas of known virus activity [47, 104] . The hypothesis that insects are the major VSV reservoir is further supported by the demonstration of vertical transmission in experimentally infected sand flies that, in nature, would allow virus to propagate and persist in insect populations without the need of an intermediate host [103, 106, 110] .",

The virus genome is an \u223c11-kilobase single strand of negative-sense RNA encoding five major viral proteins (Fig. 1 ). The N protein is the most abundant virus protein expressed in infected cells and associates closely with genomic RNA to form viral nucleocapsid, which is the functional template for both viral transcription and replication [115] . The P and L proteins associate to form the functional viral RNA polymerase that performs both transcriptase and replicase functions [21, 74, 113] . The M protein is the most abundant protein in the virus particle and has multiple functions in the infected cell, including virus budding, inhibition of host cell gene expression [2, 8, 41, 54] , and regulation of viral transcription [13, 15] . The G protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that forms trimeric spike-like structures on the virus surface [40, 55, 83, 118] , and facilitates virus attachment to host cell receptors and uptake by endocytosis. At pH <6 the G protein undergoes a conformational change resulting in the fusion of viral envelope with the membrane of endosomal vesicles [30] , releasing viral nucleocapsid and viral RNA polymerase into the host cell cytoplasm to initiate the replicative cycle.",

During this process the transcriptase complex occasionally detaches from the nucleocapsid template at intergenic junctions and must return to the 3\u2032 promoter to reinitiate transcription, which results in a pronounced 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 gradient of VmRNA expression (Fig. 2) . This transcription gradient allows the virus to express individual proteins at optimal levels for viral replication. For example, the L gene encoding the viral RNA polymerase, which is a catalytic protein needed in relatively small amounts, is distal to the 3\u2032 transcription promoter and is transcribed with low efficiency in infected cells. Conversely, the N gene encoding a major structural protein, which is required in abundance for nucleocapsid formation, is immediately adjacent to the 3\u2032 transcription promoter and is efficiently transcribed [112] .",

The mechanism responsible for switching RNA polymerase from a transcription to a replication mode is not fully understood, although a number of hypotheses have been proposed [3, 9, 10, 16, 73] . The nucleocapsid is also the functional template for genome replication as it is for transcription. The viral replicase initiates RNA synthesis at the exact genome 3\u2032-end and proceeds to the 5\u2032-end, ignoring transcription stop and start signals to produce a full-length positive sense copy of the viral genome. Nascent positiveand negative-sense genomic RNA is encapsidated with N protein in a cooperative, coreplicational manner [10, 59] , and the resulting ribonucleprotein complex subsequently functions as a template for further genome amplification and mRNA transcription. The increased availability of amplified viral genome templates for secondary transcription leads to a rapid increase in the abundance of all viral proteins needed for mature virus particle production.",

However, as a result of pioneering work carried out in a number of laboratories, a recovery process known as \"virus rescue,\" was developed approximately 10 years ago [57, 95, 116] . The rescue procedure involves the transfection of susceptible cells with plasmids expressing the virus N, P, and L proteins and a full-length positive sense genomic RNA (Fig. 3) . The N, P, and L proteins associate with the nascent genomic RNA to initiate virus replication and transcription, producing infectious virus progeny. The ability to rescue VSV from cloned cDNA has allowed fundamental questions on virus replication to be addressed, and has also enabled the rational design and development of recombinant VSV (rVSV) as a vaccine vector [27, 34, 35, 84, 85, 88, 89, 114] .",

The virus genome is simply organized into discreet transcriptional units (TUs) for expression of viral proteins, and nucleotide signal sequences Fig. 1 VSV genome organization, particle structure, and morphology. a The VSV genome encodes five major viral proteins, expressed from five discreet TUs. A single 3\u2032 transcription promoter and genome replication promoter reside within the 50-nucleotide-long leader sequence. The antigenome replication promoter resides within the 59-nucleotidelong trailer sequence. Consensus transcription start and stop signals at the beginning and end of each TU, respectively, result in the synthesis of five VmRNAs. Genome replication occurs through a positive-sense antigenome intermediate. b The VSV particle is bullet-shaped, containing a ribonucleoprotein core surrounded by a lipid envelope that is derived from host cell plasma membrane. The N protein is closely associated with genomic RNA forming viral nucleocapsid. Viral RNA polymerase comprises a complex between the P and L proteins and is packaged inside the virus particle. G protein trimers form spike-like projections from the viral envelope that attach the virus particle to host cell receptors. The electron micrograph shows VSV particles stained with phosphotungstic acid (reprinted with permission from Rose and Whitt [87]) involved in the control of viral gene expression have been defined [96] . Accordingly, one or more additional TUs encoding foreign proteins can be added to the VSV genome and robustly expressed under control of the 3\u2032 transcription promoter [82, 84, 85, 89] . Furthermore, the abundance of foreign protein expression can be modulated depending on proximity of the extra TUs relative to the 3\u2032 transcription promoter (unpublished data) [72] . Although the mutation frequency of VSV is high [18, 37] and additional foreign genes are not essential for virus replication, the consensus sequence of foreign protein open reading frames (ORFs) can be maintained over many rounds of amplification [96] , ensuring preservation of target antigens during the vaccine manufacturing process. The ability of rVSV vaccine vectors to propagate vigorously in qualified continuous cell lines also facilitates industrial scale manufacture of vaccine preparations.",

            "text": "Because human infection is rare, VSV seroprevalence in the general population is very low; therefore, preexisting immunity will not likely be a factor affecting the efficacy of future rVSV vaccine vectors, as may be the case for some other proposed viral vaccine vectors [14, 61] . Indeed, the existence of many different vesiculovirus serotypes may be exploited to design multiple rVSV vaccine vectors [88] for prevention and treatment of many different diseases. VSV does not cause any obvious signs of disease after parenteral administration to either livestock or nonhuman primates (NHPs) [89] , and rVSV vectors are anticipated to be innocuous in humans when administered parenterally. Other desirable safety features include the lack of a DNA intermediate during viral replication and the cytoplasmic site of genome replication, both of which reduce the likelihood of viral nucleic acid integration into host cell DNA. Furthermore, vector genome stability is enhanced because it is encapsidated and cannot undergo recombination. Fig. 2 The VSV mRNA transcription gradient. Genes proximal to the 3\u2032 transcription promoter are transcribed more abundantly than 5\u2032 proximal genes. The gradient of mRNA transcription arises because the RNA polymerase complex often detaches from the template at intergenic junctions and can only reinitiate transcription at the 3\u2032 transcription promoter Fig. 3 Rescue of rVSV from genomic cDNA. Virus rescue is initiated by cotransfecting plasmids (step 1) encoding the full-length viral genome and transacting viral polypeptides. T7 RNA polymerase, introduced into the cell by a variety of different methods, mediates RNA synthesis in the cell cytoplasm during the earliest stages of rescue, producing copies of the viral genomic RNA and transcripts encoding the transacting polypeptides (N, P, and L) needed to promote de novo assembly of a nucleocapsid (step 2). Functional nucleocapsid subsequently serves as a template for genome replication, transcription of all VmRNAs, and accumulation of viral proteins (steps 3-5) triggering ensuing events in the viral replication cycle including virus assembly (step 6) and budding (step 7) In the prototypic rVSV vectors, foreign genes were expressed from a TU inserted at position 5 in the viral genome ( Fig. 4 ) between the G and L genes [49, 84, 85, 89] . This insertion site was chosen to minimally perturb the stoichiometry of viral protein expression, which is modulated by distance of each gene from the 3\u2032 transcription promoter. Because the L protein has a catalytic function, displacing the L gene by one additional TU from the 3\u2032 promoter was viewed as a conservative genome alteration that should not adversely affect viral replication, while allowing adequate foreign protein expression to generate an immune response. This rationale was supported by in vitro growth studies showing only minimal reduction in peak virus titers for vectors containing an extra foreign gene between the G and L genes [22, 85] . Furthermore, the level of foreign protein expression was sufficient to elicit robust antigen-specific immune responses after a single inoculation of mice and rabbits [82, 84, 85] . In some cases, primary immune responses could be further boosted with a second dose of homologous vaccine 1 to 2 months later [82, 85] . However, because durable neutralizing antibodies are usually elicited against the VSV surface glycoprotein after a single vaccination with replication-competent rVSV vectors, glycoprotein exchange vectors were designed to allow more effective boosting of immune responses to target antigens. The exchange vectors were generated by switching the IND serotype G gene in priming vectors with either the VSV NJ or Chandipura serotype G gene in boosting vectors [88] .",

In these pioneering studies, rhesus macaques were immunized with a combination of two prototypic rVSV vectors expressing a HIV-1 89.6 Env gp160/VSV-G fusion polypeptide and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag p55 protein. Vaccine vector administration by a combination of intramuscular and intranasal routes clearly demonstrated the ability of rVSV vectors to elicit potent antigen-specific cellmediated immune responses in NHPs. In addition, this study also clearly demonstrated for the first time the ability of rVSV vectors expressing Env and Gag proteins to provide highly significant protection from AIDS after an intravenous heterologous SIV/HIV (SHIV) 89 .6P challenge [89] . In this study, all seven macaques receiving rVSV expressing HIVenv and SIVgag remained disease-free after SHIV 89.6P challenge for >4 years ( [89] and J. Rose, personal communication). By comparison, all eight control macaques [either unimmunized or immunized with labadapted rVSV expressing influenza hemagglutinin (HA)] progressed to AIDS with an average time of 8 months ( [89] and J. Rose, personal communication). The protection from AIDS in this study correlated with large differences in peak viral loads, low or undetectable viral loads at set point, and with the preservation of CD4 + T cells in the vaccinees relative to controls. This encouraging level of postchallenge vaccine efficacy suggested that rVSV vectors expressing HIV genes might be an effective AIDS vaccine in humans.",

Most notably, rVSV-based vaccine vectors, at least in animal models, can be safely and effectively administered via a mucosal route as shown in several animal models. For example, a single intranasal inoculation with an rVSV vector expressing the influenza virus HA protein in mice [84, 85] , the herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 glycoprotein D in mice [69] , or a measles virus HA protein in cotton rats [94] completely protected animals against mucosal challenge with the corresponding wild-type pathogen. Recently, our laboratory systematically compared the immunogenicity of rVSV vaccine vectors when given either as an intramuscular or intranasal inoculation in an effort to determine which route of vaccine administration was optimal for inducing humoral and cellular immune responses in rhesus macaques [19] .

Although the rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vectors described above are attenuated relative to VSV field isolates, they are replica-tion-competent and subject to the same stringent safety testing used for other live attenuated vaccine viruses. For this reason, the prototypic rVSV vector and a number of closely related rVSV vectors expressing HIV-1 Gag protein were tested in an exploratory NHP NV study. This study was also warranted by historical data showing that VSV field isolates and tissue culture-adapted VSV strains were neurotrophic and neurovirulent in rodents [81, 92, 111] , and that VSV serially passaged in mouse brain was found to be neurovirulent in livestock and NHPs inoculated by the intracranial route [29, 70] .",

The step-wise translocation of the N gene further away from the 3\u2032 transcription promoter leads to incremental reduction in N protein expression, thereby limiting nucleocapsid formation (Figs. 2 and 5). Because nucleocapsid is the functional template for mRNA transcription and genome replication and is part of the virion core, limiting nucleocapsid leads to a decrease in viral protein synthesis, genome amplification, and formation of mature virus particles. In addition to providing a means of attenuating rVSV vectors incrementally, another attractive feature of this attenuation strategy is the known genetic stability of N gene translocations [4, 27] , which greatly eliminates the likelihood of reversion. Truncation of the CT region of G protein was also used to attenuate in vitro growth and in vivo virulence of rVSV vectors [85, 98] . The wild-type G protein CT region is 29 amino acids in length. However, when the CT was truncated to either one or nine amino acids (CT1 and CT9, respectively) ( Fig. 6) , peak virus titers obtained in cell culture were reduced, and the resulting viruses were less pathogenic in mice after intranasal inoculation [85, 98] . The attenuation mechanism likely involves an impaired interaction between the viral ribonucleoprotein core and the truncated G protein CTs during viral morphogenesis [66, 71, 98] , leading to a reduction in the efficiency of virus particle assembly. As seen for N gene translocation, G protein CT truncation also gives rise to virus with a very stable attenuation phenotype because replacement of deleted sequence encoding part of a protein is very improbable.",

These conditional mutants usually propagate robustly at a permissive temperature and poorly or not at all at a defined nonpermissive temperature. Because the temperature of nasal epithelium is typically lower than core body temperature, selective incorporation of ts mutations should produce rVSV vectors that replicate vigorously at 32-35\u00b0C but not at 37\u00b0C, and serve as vectors for intranasal Step-wise translocation of the N gene further away from the 3\u2032 transcription promoter leads to incremental attenuation of virus growth in vitro and in vivo. This method of attenuation relies on downregulation of N protein expression due to the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 transcription gradient Fig. 6 Attenuation of rVSV by G protein truncation. Truncation of the CT region of the rVSV G protein from 29 amino acids to either nine (CT9) or one (CT1) amino acids progressively attenuates virus growth in vitro and in vivo. It is believed that viral morphogenesis is adversely affected due to impaired interaction between shorter CTs and underlying viral core proteins (Fig. 7b) . The molecular mechanism of ts attenuation is often not clearly defined but probably involves impaired protein folding and instability at the nonpermissive temperature.",

Another related vector has most of the G protein ectodomain deleted (G stem), retaining the CT region, transmembrane domain, and 42 amino acids of the membrane proximal ectodomain (Fig. 8) . This vector is also propagation-defective, requiring G protein in trans for production of infectious particles in vitro. Expression of the truncated form of G protein (G stem) enhances the overall yield of progeny virus particles in vitro compared to vectors with the entire G gene deleted, perhaps due to increased concentration of G protein CTs at the cell plasma membrane, facilitating virus assembly and budding [86] .

However, some vectors still displayed levels of NV that were almost equivalent to unaltered prototypic rVSV vector after intracranial inoculation of mice [28, 77, 114] . In addition, one of the attenuated vectors containing a G protein CT truncation that was highly attenuated in vitro and after intranasal inoculation of mice still caused moderate levels of neuropathology in the NHP NV model (J. Erik Johnson et al., submitted for publication). These observations indicated that the previously described attenuation strategies might not be sufficient to reduce rVSV vector NV in animal models to a level that would be acceptable to regulatory agencies. Therefore, additional strategies to further attenuate rVSV vectors are being explored, including combinations of CT truncations with either N gene rearrangements or Mncp mutations (Fig. 9) . It was thought that these mutation combinations would increase vector attenuation beyond levels obtained using single attenuation strategies. Other types of gene rearrangement, including M and G gene shuffling, singly and in combination, are also under investigation [5, 25] .

Combination of attenuation strategies may further extend the range of attenuated rVSV vectors to be tested to achieve an optimum balance of safety and immunogenicity. N gene shuffles may be combined with either G protein CT truncations or Mncp mutations.

This was done to promote efficient rescue from cDNA and maintain viral replicative fitness. However, due to the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 transcription gradient, positioning the foreign gene toward the 5\u2032-end of the genome reduces the expression of the foreign antigen, relative to the four VSV 3\u2032 proximal gene products. Therefore, future rVSV vectors will be designed with the foreign antigen gene at the 3\u2032-end of the VSV genome (position 1), thereby maximizing the expression of the foreign antigen. Positioning the foreign gene in the first position in the genome should also have an attenuating effect on virus growth as all viral genes will be translocated further away from the 3\u2032 transcription promoter, reducing their expression.",

In addition, the primary immune response to the vector often limits the effectiveness of subsequent booster immunizations. In both small animal models and NHPs, a strong serotype-specific neutralizing antibody response is generated against the G protein of VSV after a single inoculation. The presence of these neutralizing antibodies precludes using the identical rVSV vector as a boosting vector in animals and will presumably have the same effect after vaccination in humans. To circumvent neutralizing antibodies and create vectors for boosting, Rose et al. [88] developed rVSV glycoprotein exchange vectors that encode the N, P, M, and L genes of the VSV IND serotype, but have the gene expressing the VSV IND serotype G protein substituted with either the gene expressing the VSV NJ serotype G protein or the gene for the G protein of the related Vesiculovirus Chandipura virus [88] . While these glycoprotein exchange vectors circumvent the neutralizing antibody response to the G protein, it is possible that T cell responses to the N, P, M, and L proteins might restrict virus replication and limit the ability of these vectors to boost responses. Generation of a complete rVSV NJ serotype vector was not attempted due to the potential for cross-reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses between IND and NJ VSV serotypes. However, there are additional viruses in the Vesiculovirus genus that could be used to supply G genes for future rVSV G protein exchange vectors if multiple boosting vectors are desired. Attachment glycoprotein exchange of this manner does introduce a new gene into the vector, may alter the vector phenotype, and therefore careful safety testing must be conducted before advancing these vectors to clinical trials.",

Studies in mice conducted with vectors expressing HIV Env or Gag showed that boosting rVSV-primed animals with vaccinia-based vectors produced a fivefold increase in peak HIV-specific CD8 + T cell responses relative to mice boosted with rVSV glycoprotein exchange vectors [35] . As a follow up study, Ramsburg et al. [78] compared the effectiveness of a single prime-boost immunization regimen in macaques consisting of lab-adapted G protein exchange VSV vectors expressing SHIV env, gag, and pol proteins to that of a protocol consisting of a lab-adapted rVSV vector prime followed by a single boost with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the same SHIV proteins. The macaques primed with a rVSV vectors expressing SHIV proteins and boosted once with a MVA vector expressing SHIV proteins mounted increased immune responses relative to animals boosted with VSV exchange vectors; however, due to the small numbers of macaques in each group, this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Nevertheless, after intravenous SHIV 89.6P challenge, MVA-boosted macaques demonstrated a further 1 log 10 reduction in peak viral loads, cleared challenge virus faster, and preserved CD4 + -T cell counts to a greater extent than macaques receiving VSV G protein exchange vectors. Collectively, these data suggest that while G protein exchange rVSV vectors can circumvent VSV-specific neutralizing antibody and boost vaccinespecific immune responses, vaccine-specific immunogenicity and efficacy are substantially improved by boosting with a heterologous viral vector.",

In the effort to use rVSV as a vaccine vector for human diseases, many groups have either replaced the VSV G protein or coexpressed it with glycoproteins from targeted human pathogens including hantavirus [ [32, 33] . When tested in animal models, these vectors elicited immune responses directed against the expressed foreign glycoproteins. More recently, NHPs immunized with rVSV vectors expressing glycoproteins from either Marburg or Ebola viruses were protected from disease after challenge with these pathogens [44] . Moreover, it is likely that replacing the VSV G protein with filoviruses glycoproteins altered rVSV vector tissue tropism such that they could readily target dendritic cells, as filoviruses are known to do. Such retargeted rVSV vectors could be designed to express additional foreign antigens from unrelated pathogens and serve as either priming or boosting vectors along with rVSV IND and NJ serotype vectors. Because retargeting by glycoprotein exchange can markedly alter virus phenotype and cell tropism, any new rVSV vector of this type will require extensive safety studies before clinical assessment.",

VSV is naturally found in insects and livestock, is not considered a human pathogen, and has a very low seroprevalence in human populations. The small, simply organized viral genome can be altered to stably express one or more foreign proteins, and the resulting viral vectors can be amplified to high a titer in approved cell lines. The virus has a very broad host range and rVSV vector serotype can be changed simply by switching the surface glycoprotein with that from other vesiculovirus serotypes. VSV replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells, does not persist in vivo, and viral nucleic acid does not integrate into host genomic DNA.

Therefore, to investigate the potential neurotropism and NV of prototypic rVSV/ HIV-1 vaccine vectors, exploratory NV testing in NHPs was carried out. The results of these tests indicated that the prototypic rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine vectors required further attenuation before clinical evaluation. A variety of different attenuation strategies and combinations thereof are being evaluated to define a more acceptable attenuation phenotype. A very sensitive mouse LD 50 NV model can be used to rank order rVSV vector attenuation level. Vectors that cause minimal morbidity and mortality in the mouse model will then be further tested in ferret and NHP NV models to assess residual vector virulence.
