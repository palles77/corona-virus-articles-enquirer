In this regard, coronaviruses have evolved a complicated receptor-recognition system through their spike proteins. Spikes from highly related coronaviruses can recognize distinct receptors, whereas spikes of distant coronaviruses can employ the same cell-surface molecule for entry. Moreover, coronavirus spikes can recognize a broad range of cell-surface molecules in addition to the receptors and thereby can augment coronavirus attachment or entry. The receptor of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). In this study, we identified membrane-associated 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) as an additional binding target of the MERS-CoV spike.

Among the six human coronaviruses, the Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E spike binds aminopeptidase N (12) , whereas the lineage C Betacoronavirus the MERS-CoV spike recognizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (13) . Intriguingly, the Alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 and the lineage B Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV both utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry (14, 15) . However, the protein receptors for the lineage A Betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are currently unknown. In addition to their designated receptors, coronavirus spikes are known to recognize a broad array of cell-surface molecules, which serve to facilitate the attachment or entry of the viruses. For example, HCoV-NL63 and mouse hepatitis virus both employ heparan sulfate proteoglycans to enhance attachment (16, 17) . Similarly, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, bovine coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 bind to O-acetylated sialic acid as key attachment molecules (18 -21) . Interestingly, in addition to utilizing O-acetylated sialic acid as a critical binding determinant (21) , HCoV-HKU1 spike also recognizes major histocompatibility complex class I C as another attachment molecule (22) . In the case of SARS-CoV, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and DC-SIGN-related both augment virus entry (23, 24) . For MERS-CoV, we previously reported carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) as an attachment factor that could modulate MERS-CoV entry in permissive cells (25) . More recently, tetraspanin CD9 was identified as a host cell--surface factor that facilitated MERS-CoV entry by scaffolding host cell receptors and proteases (26) .",

To this end, we aimed to investigate whether additional cell-surface molecules were involved in the attachment or entry of MERS-CoV. In this study, we reported that the MERS-CoV spike could recognize a 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78). Although traditionally regarded as an ER protein with chaperone activity, recent discoveries suggest that GRP78 is also localized to the cell surface, where they carry out physiological functions that regulate signaling and cellular homeostasis (27) . Subsequent experiments demonstrated that GRP78 did not render nonpermissive cells susceptible to MERS-CoV infection but played a positive role in augmenting MERS-CoV entry in permissive cells, suggesting that GRP78 is an attachment factor of MERS-CoV that can modulate MERS-CoV entry in the presence of the host cell receptor DPP4. Importantly, our data further indicated that the spike protein of a lineage D Betacoronavirus, bat coronavirus HKU9 (bCoV-HKU9), also recognized GRP78, which played a key role in the attachment of HKU9 -S-pseudovirus to the bat Rousettus leschenaulti kidney (RLK) cells. Our findings highlight the importance of the possible evolution of different animal and human coronaviruses to become capable of using not just the same host receptors but also the same attachment factors, which may facilitate animal coronaviruses to jump the interspecies barrier into human.",

In this study, we asked whether additional membrane proteins could interact with the MERS-CoV spike and facilitate the entry or attachment of MERS-CoV. To this end, we transfected human bronchus epithelial cells, BEAS2B, with the MERS-CoV spike and evaluated the membrane proteins that might bind the MERS-CoV spike in the transfected cells. In brief, membrane proteins from pcDNA-MERS-CoV-S1-V5-transfected BEAS2B cells were extracted and sedimented (Fig. 1) . To evaluate the extraction efficiency, the cell extracts were probed for markers of different cellular fractions, including that of the plasma membrane (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and pancadherin), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (calreticulin), Golgi (giantin), and nucleus (lamin A). Western blotting analyses revealed that our membrane extracts were enriched with the plasma membrane markers, EGFR and pan-cadherin. In contrast, only a trace amount of the ER marker was observed, whereas the signal for Golgi and nucleus was not detected ( Fig. 1D and Fig. S1 ).",

First, BHK21 cells were transfected with GRP78 -V5 or the pcDNA-V5 control vector. The cell lysates of the transfected cells were then immunoprecipitated with either MERS-CoV-S1-FLAG or Escherichia coli bacterial alkaline phosphatase-FLAG (BAP-FLAG) pre-adsorbed on anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads. The precipitated protein complexes were then detected by Western blotting with the anti-FLAG or the anti-V5 antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 2A , GRP78 specifically immunoprecipitated with MERS-CoV-S1 (lower panel, lane 1) but not the control bait protein, BAP (lower panel, lane 2). Additionally, GRP78 was not precipitated in cells transfected with the empty vector ( Fig. 2A, lower panel, lane 3) . To confirm the interaction between GRP78 and MERS-CoV-S1, we performed reciprocal co-IP using GRP78 as the bait protein ( Fig. 2B ). In this setting, cell lysates of GRP78 -V5 or empty vector transfected BHK21 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 pre-adsorbed protein A/G-Sepharose and incubated with purified MERS-CoV-S1-FLAG or BAP-FLAG. Our result demonstrated that MERS-CoV-S1-FLAG but not BAP-FLAG was efficiently immunoprecipitated by GRP78 -V5 (Fig.  2B, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2) . As a negative control, the expression of pcDNA-V5 empty vector failed to immunoprecipitate with MERS-CoV-S1-FLAG (Fig. 2B , upper panel, lane 3). In parallel, MERS-CoV-S1-FLAG did not co-IP with the abundantly expressed cell-surface protein EGFR, suggesting the interaction between MERS-CoV-S1-FLAG and GRP78 was specific (Fig. S2, A and B) . Next, we evaluated whether the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike and GRP78 could occur at the cell surface. To this end, we obtained the membrane fraction of Huh7 cells that was predominantly enriched with the plasma membrane contents of the cells. We then added MERS-CoV-S1-FLAG protein to the membrane extracts and performed co-IP between the MERS-CoV spike and GRP78. Our data showed that the MERS-CoV spike and the endogenous GRP78 in the membrane extract could efficiently interact with each other (Fig. 2, C and D) .",

Intriguingly, surface GRP78 expression was similarly detected in nonhuman cell lines, including BHK21, L929, VeroE6, and RLK. Quantitative analysis of the expression rate (Fig. 3D ) and mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) (Fig. 3E ) from the immunolabeled cells revealed that surface DPP4 and GRP78 were expressed at comparative levels in most measured cell lines with the exception of L929. The ubiquitous detection of GRP78 across cell lines from different species by the human GRP78 antibody could be attributed to the high degree of GRP78 sequence homology between mammalian species, suggesting that the protein is well conserved in mammalian cells (Fig. 3F) . Altogether, the surface expression of GRP78 on MERS-CoV-susceptible cells supported the notion that GRP78 might be involved in modulating MERS-CoV entry. However, the ubiquitous expression of GRP78, particularly on cells that are not permissive to MERS-CoV infection, including BHK21 and L929, suggested that GRP78 might play an auxiliary rather than a determining role in MERS-CoV entry.",

Our immunostaining results demonstrated that GRP78 was expressed at multiple regions of the human lung tissues. In particular, specific GRP78 expression was abundantly detected on the epithelial cells of the bronchus (Fig. 4A ), bronchiole (Fig. 4B ), and alveolus ( Fig. 4C ). Most importantly, double immunostaining of DPP4 and GRP78 revealed extensive co-localization of DPP4 and GRP78 among the epithelial cells lining the human airways ( Fig. 4 , A-C). The co-localization between DPP4 and GRP78 on the apical side of the epithelial cells indicated the potential of GRP78 in facilitating MERS-CoV entry or attachment (Fig. 4D , arrows). Interestingly, the co-expression of DPP4 and GRP78 could also be recognized in extrapulmonary tissues, including the small intestine (Fig. S3A ) and the kidney (Fig. S3B) . Overall, our data demonstrated that GRP78 was co-expressed with DPP4 on physiologically relevant cell types in the human lung and could potentially be involved during MERS-CoV infection in the lower respiratory tract.",

In this set of experiments, Huh7 and BEAS2B cells were preincubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GRP78 or a nontargeting rabbit control IgG. After the pre-incubation, MERS-S-pseudoviruses were added to the cells for 1 h in the presence of the GRP78 antibody or the control IgG. At 72 h post-inoculation, the cells were lysed and incubated with luciferase substrate for the quantification of infectivity. Our results demonstrated that GRP78 antibody but not the control IgG reduced MERS-S-pseudovirus entry in both Huh7 (Fig. 5A ) and BEAS2B cells (Fig. 5B ) in a dose-dependent manner. In stark contrast, the entry of the control vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudovirus in both cell lines was not inhibited by GRP78 antibody (Fig. 5, A and B) . Next, we proceeded to validate the antibody blocking results using infectious MERS-CoV. To this end, Huh7 cells were pre-incubated with antibodies and subsequently infected with MERS-CoV in the presence of control IgG, GRP78 antibody, or DPP4 antibody. Our data showed that the treatment of GRP78 antibody similarly inhibited MERS-CoV entry in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C ). For further verification, we infected Huh7 and BEAS2B cells with MERS-CoV after siRNA knockdown of GRP78 or DPP4. Western blotting detection demonstrated that GRP78 knockdown did not affect DPP4 or CEACAM5 expression ( Fig. 5D ). In line with the antibody blocking results, depletion of GRP78 reduced MERS-CoV entry in both Huh7 and BEAS2B cells (Fig. 5E ). Because CEACAM5 was expressed in Huh7 but not BEAS2B cells, our data implied that the role of GRP78 in modulating MERS-CoV entry was independent of CEACAM5 expression. To further evaluate the role of GRP78 on MERS-CoV replication, we assessed virus growth in MERS-CoV-infected BEAS2B cells after siRNA knockdown of GRP78 or DPP4. Our data demonstrated that GRP78 depletion decreased MERS-CoV replication, although to a lesser extent compared with that of DPP4 knockdown (Fig. 5, F and G) . Next, we asked whether GRP78 could play a role in MERS-CoV entry in the physiologically relevant primary cells. To this end, we performed siRNA knockdown of GRP78 (Fig. 5H ) in primary human MDM and primary human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HFL), which are both susceptible to MERS-CoV infection as reported in our previous studies (32, 34) . In agreement with our results from Huh7 and BEAS2B cells, GRP78 knockdown significantly reduced virus entry ( ",

First, we sought to evaluate the capacity of GRP78 in facilitating MERS-CoV attachment. To this end, GRP78-transfected AD293 or BHK21 cells were challenged with MERS-CoV at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. After the incubation, the cells were washed, fixed, and immunolabeled for MERS-CoV N. As illustrated in Fig. 6A , GRP78 overexpression significantly increased virus attachment in both AD293 and BHK21 cells. Interestingly, GRP78 overexpression appeared to induce a more substantial increase in MERS-CoV attachment in the MERS-CoV-nonsusceptible BHK21 cells than that in the MERS-CoV-susceptible AD293 cells (Fig. 6B) . Next, to address whether GRP78 could independently facilitate MERS-CoV entry, we assessed the level of MERS-CoV entry in AD293 and BHK21 cells upon GRP78 overexpression. To this end, GRP78-transfected AD293 and BHK21 cells were challenged with MERS-CoV at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. After infection, the cells were washed and incubated for another 4 h before harvesting for flow cytometry. Importantly, our result demonstrated that the nonpermissive BHK21 cells remained refractory to MERS-CoV infection despite GRP78 overexpression. In contrast, GRP78 overexpression further enhanced the entry of MERS-CoV to the permissive AD293 cells (Fig. 6, C and D) . The effect of GRP78 on MERS-CoV entry was not due to ER stress (Fig. S4) . Overall, our data indicated that GRP78 could not facilitate MERS-CoV entry independently but could serve as an attachment factor and modulate MERS-CoV entry in the presence of DPP4. Immunostaining of GRP78 and DPP4 was performed on paraffin slides of normal human tissues. GRP78 was labeled with a polyclonal rabbit anti-GRP78 antibody, and DPP4 was labeled with a polyclonal goat anti-DPP4 antibody. Cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI.

            "text": "Coronaviruses have evolved a complicated receptor recognition system through their spike proteins. Peculiarly, the spike proteins from highly-related coronaviruses can recognize different cell-surface molecules, whereas the spike proteins of phylogenetically distant coronaviruses can bind the same cellsurface molecule for attachment or entry (11) . By exploring the potential interaction between GRP78 and the spike proteins of other coronaviruses, we unexpectedly discovered that GRP78 could interact with the spike protein of bat coronavirus HKU9 (bCoV-HKU9) (Fig. 8A) . Interestingly, despite the capacity of binding the spike proteins of lineage C (MERS-CoV) and lineage D (bCoV-HKU9) Betacoronavirus, GRP78 did not interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV, which is a lineage B Betacoronavirus (Fig. 8B) . In 2007, we reported the first discovery and genome characterization of bCoV-HKU9, which was identified from Leschenault's rousette bats (R. leschenaulti) (44) . Recently, with structural analysis and surface plasmon resonance assay, it appeared that the receptor-binding domain of bCoV-HKU9 spike was incapable of reacting with either human DPP4 or ACE2 (45) . In this regard, it would be important to explore the potential physiological relevance of the interaction between GRP78 and bCoV-HKU9 spike. We first evaluated the cell tropism of HKU9 -S-pseudovirus with MERS-S-pseudovirus included as a control. Remarkably, our data suggested that among the 10 evaluated mammalian cell lines, HKU9 -S-pseudovirus entry was most pronounced in R. leschenaulti kidney (RLK) cells (Fig. 8C) . Notably, although MERS-S-pseudovirus entry was evident in RLK cells, culture for bCoV-HKU9 in RLK or other cell lines has not been successful (44) . In line with the pseudovirus entry result, the surface-binding efficiency of HKU9 -S-pseudovirus on RLK cells was \u03f33-fold that on Caco2 cells (Fig. 8D) , which is a human colon cell line known to be permissive for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection. Notably, overexpression of human GRP78 in the apparently nonpermissive L929 and BHK21 cells did not render the cells permissive to HKU9 -S-pseudovirus entry, indicating that GRP78 could not function as an independent receptor for bCoV-HKU9 (Fig. 8E) . In contrast, with a flow cytometry-based surface-binding assay, we demonstrated that the GRP78 anti- body (Fig. 8G) but not the control IgG (Fig. 8F ) reduced the binding of HKU9 -S-pseudovirus to the cell surface of RLK cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was evidenced by the drop in the percentage of HKU9 -S-positive cells (Fig. 8H) as well as the decrease in the HKU9 -S-mean fluorescent intensity (Fig.  8I) . Taken together, our data identified GRP78 as an important cell surface-binding protein for both MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9 by serving as an attachment factor.",

To investigate whether GRP78 and sialic acids could act in conjunction with each other in facilitating the attachment of MERS-CoV, we assessed MERS-S-pseudovirus entry in the presence of a combination of neuraminidase treatment and GRP78 antibody blocking. Our results demonstrated that although neuraminidase treatment decreased MERS-S-pseudovirus entry in a dose-dependent manner, the addition of GRP78 antibody further enhanced the inhibitory effect (Fig. 9A) . However, the entry of HKU9 -S-pseudovirus was inhibited by GRP78 antibody but not neuraminidase treatment (Fig. 9B) . Overall, the additive effect of neuraminidase treatment and GRP78 antibody on limiting MERS-S-pseudovirus entry suggested that sialic acids and GRP78 both independently facilitated the attachment of MERS-CoV onto the cell surface, whereas GRP78 but not sialic acids played an important role for virus attachment of bCoV-HKU9.",

GRP78 was expressed on the surface of MERS-CoV-susceptible cell lines of pulmonary and extrapulmonary origin (Fig. 3) . At the same time, immunostaining of human lung tissues identified abundant co-expression of DPP4 and GRP78 in the epithelial cells along the human airways (Fig. 4 ). Next, with antibody blocking and siRNA knockdown experiments, our data indicated the involvement of GRP78 in MERS-CoV entry (Fig. 5) .

Purified bCoV-HKU9 -S1-FLAG (lanes 1 and 3) or BAP-FLAG proteins (lane 2) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with overexpressed GRP78 -V5 or pcDNA-V5 proteins pre-adsorbed on anti-V5-Sepharose beads. The precipitated protein complex was detected using the anti-V5 antibody or the anti-FLAG antibody. B, co-IP between GRP78 and SARS-CoV spike was performed using GRP78 as the bait protein. Purified SARS-CoV-S1-FLAG (lanes 1 and 3) or BAP-FLAG proteins (lane 2) were immunoprecipitated with overexpressed GRP78 -V5 or pcDNA-V5 proteins pre-adsorbed on anti-V5-Sepharose beads. The precipitated protein complex was detected using the anti-V5 antibody or the anti-FLAG antibody. C, HKU9 -S-pseudovirus entry assays were performed in a number of mammalian cell lines. Mock-inoculated and MERS-S-pseudovirus-inoculated cells were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. HKU9 -S-pseudovirus and MERS-S-pseudovirus were added at a ratio of 100 LP per cell for 1 h. Luciferase activity was determined at 72 h post-inoculation. D, HKU9 -S-pseudovirus attachment efficiency was evaluated in Caco2 and RLK cells. HKU9 -S-pseudovirus was inoculated on Caco2 and RLK cells at 100 LP per cell for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. After 2 h, the cells were washed, fixed, and immunolabeled for flow cytometry. HKU9 -S-pseudovirus binding was identified with an in-house mouse bCoV-HKU9 spike immune serum. E, HKU9 -S-pseudovirus entry in L929 and BHK21 cells was assessed with or without GRP78 overexpression. HKU9 -S-pseudovirus was inoculated at 100 LP per cell for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Luciferase activity was determined at 72 h post-inoculation. F and G, antibody-blocking assay for HKU9 -Spseudovirus binding was performed in RLK cells. RLK cells were pre-incubated with the rabbit anti-GRP78 antibody and the rabbit control IgG from 0 to 5 g/ml.

Intriguingly, GRP78 was up-regulated upon MERS-CoV infection, which might further facilitate virus attachment among the infected cells (Fig. 7) . Most importantly, GRP78 was also recognized by the spike protein of a bat Betacoronavirus, bCoV-HKU9. Our result further indicated that GRP78 was not the functional receptor of bCoV-HKU9 but could modulate HKU9 -S-pseudovirus attachment to RLK cells (Fig. 8) . Simultaneous treatments of neuraminidase and GRP78 antibody blocking revealed that sialic acids and GRP78 both independently facilitated the attachment of MERS-CoV onto the cell surface, whereas virus attachment of bCoV-HKU9 was mediated by GRP78 but not sialic acids (Fig. 9) . Overall, our study identified GRP78 as an attachment factor that might modulate virus entry for two phylogenetically related Betacoronaviruses of different lineages, MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9.",

            "text": "GRP78, also referred to as BiP or HSPA5, is traditionally recognized as an ER chaperone (27) . It is involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including protein folding and assembly, translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides, degradation of misfolded proteins, as well as maintaining the ER homeostasis (27) . In addition, GRP78 is an essential regulator of ER stress due to its critical role in the unfolded protein response pathway. Despite its participation in ER-related functions, GRP78 is also detected in other cellular fractions, including mitochondria, nucleus, cytosol, and plasma membrane (43) . In recent years, an increasing number of studies have described the physiological role of cell-surface GRP78 during virus entry. For instance, GRP78 was identified as a co-receptor for coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9) (30) and dengue virus (47). In addition, cell-surface GRP78 also facilitates the entry of Japanese encephalitis virus (29) . Here, we reported GRP78 as a host factor that could serve as an attachment protein for two Betacoronaviruses, MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9. In its capacity as an attachment factor, GRP78 may serve to concentrate virus particles on the cell surface, which may then increase the possibility of receptor-mediated virus entry for MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9. Importantly, MERS-CoV infection resulted in an up-regulation of GRP78 on the cell surface, which may in turn increase the attachment of MERS-CoV and further enhance the possibility of virus entry in the infected cells.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses can recognize a wide range of cell-surface molecules, including cell membrane proteins and sugars in addition to their cellular receptors. As an example, HCoV-NL63 employs ACE2 for host cell entry (14) but can bind to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans to enhance attachment and infection of target cells (16) . We have previously reported the identification of CEACAM5 as an attachment factor of MERS-CoV, which could facilitate MERS-CoV entry in the presence of DPP4 (25) . Recently, CD9 was reported as a host factor that could augment MERS-CoV entry by bringing the cellular receptor and proteases into close proximity, thus increasing the infection efficiency (26) . In this study, the identification of GRP78 as an attachment factor of MERS-CoV further indicated that the spike protein of MERS-CoV is highly efficient in engaging multiple cell surface factors to facilitate virus entry. In contrast to CEACAM5, which is expressed on limited cell types (25) , surface GRP78 expression appeared to be relatively abundant across various cell types of different tissue origin (Fig. 3) . In addition, a remarkable level of GRP78 was specifically detected on the epithelial cells along the human airways, where it was found to colocalize with DPP4 (Fig. 4) . In this regard, it is tempting to speculate that the capacity of the MERS-CoV spike to utilize multiple host surface proteins, including CEACAM5, CD9, and GRP78, may give MERS-CoV a physiological advantage in establishing efficient infections, which may contribute to the high pathogenicity of the virus.",

The virus was first identified in 2007 in a territory-wide molecular surveillance study on bat samples from the Guangdong province of Southern China (44) . Subsequent studies suggested that the virus was widely distributed and was circulating in different bat species (48 -51) . Structural and functional features of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of bCoV-HKU9 demonstrated that the spike protein of the virus was incapable of interacting with either DPP4 or ACE2 (45) . However, the RBD of bCoV-HKU9 contained a conserved core structure that was shared across other Betacoronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and bat coronavirus HKU4 (bCoV-HKU4) (45) . Notably, recent reports demonstrated that bCoV-HKU4 could recognize human DPP4 as a functional receptor, indicating the potential of bat coronaviruses in human adaptations. In this regard, the identification of GRP78 as a shared attachment factor for MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9 is interesting but alarming, which highlighted the importance of continuous surveillance on the other members of the Betacoronavirus genus for their capacity of interspecies transmission.",

The human Alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 may be a recombinant between NL63-like viruses in Triaenops bats and 229E-like viruses circulating in Hipposideros bats (52) . Another human Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E has closely-related 229E-like coronaviruses recently isolated from dromedary camels (53) . Similarly, the lineage A Betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 was postulated to originate from a bovine coronavirus and jumped into human in the 1890s (2, 54) . The lineage B Betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV, originated from either civets or bats, which jumped into human in 2003 (55, 56), whereas the lineage C Betacoronavirus, MERS-CoV, is likely to have jumped from camels into human in 2012 (57, 58) . Because three (lineages A, B, and C) out of four lineages of animal Betacoronaviruses have independently jumped from animal into human in the recent past, there is enough reason to suspect that a lineage D Betacoronavirus may also jump into human one day. Our finding of the lineage C MERS-CoV and lineage D bCoV-HKU9 sharing the same host attachment factor GRP78 highlights the importance of monitoring the evolution of bCoV-HKU9, which may jump the interspecies barrier into human leading to another major epidemic in the future.",

A titration of GRP78 or isotype control antibodies from 0 to 2.5 g/ml was added and pre-incubated with Huh7 and BEAS2B cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. MERS-S-pseudovirus or VSV-G-pseudovirus was subsequently added at a ratio of 100 LP per cell for 1 h. Luciferase activity was determined at 72 h post-inoculation and was normalized to that of the mock-treated cells. C, antibody blocking assay was performed in Huh7 cells using infectious MERS-CoV.Huh7 cells were pre-incubated with antibodies at the indicated concentration for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then challenged with MERS-CoV at 1 m.o.i. for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of the antibodies. After 1 h, the cells were washed and harvested. MERS-CoV entry was assessed with qPCR, and the result was normalized to that of the mock-treated cells. D, Huh7 or BEAS2B cells were treated with 75 nM GRP78, DPP4, or scrambled siRNA for 2 consecutive days. The knockdown efficiency was evaluated with Western blottings. E, siRNA-treated Huh7 or BEAS2B cells were infected with MERS-CoV at 1 m.o.i. for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After 1 h, the cells were harvested, and virus entry was evaluated with qPCR analysis. The result was normalized to that of the scrambled siRNA-treated cells. siRNA-treated BEAS2B cells were infected with MERS-CoV at 0.1 m.o.i. for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cell lysates (F) and supernatants (G) were harvested at 24 and 48 h post-infection. MERS-CoV replication was evaluated with qPCR analysis. H, siRNA-treated MDM or HFL was infected with MERS-CoV at 1 m.o.i. for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. After 2 h, the cells were harvested, and virus entry was evaluated with qPCR analysis (I). The result was normalized to that of the scrambled siRNA-treated cells. siRNA-treated MDM or HFL was infected with MERS-CoV at 0.1 m.o.i. for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cell lysates (J) and supernatants (K) were harvested at 24 h post-infection. MERS-CoV replication was evaluated with qPCR analysis.In all panels, data represented mean and S.D. from three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were carried out using Student's t test.
