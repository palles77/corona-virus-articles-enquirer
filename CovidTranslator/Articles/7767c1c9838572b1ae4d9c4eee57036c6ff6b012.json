A major surge constitutes the need for mass critical care. Most hospitals can accommodate a minor surge (an increase in admissions of up to 15% above normal capacity) and could probably cope with a moderate surge that requires a regional response. However, in a mass pediatric critical care situation, both local and regional resources would be overwhelmed. Response would entail a major increase in capacity, crisis standards of care with different nurse/patient ratios, and care by personnel not necessarily trained in critical care.",

The basis for pediatric-specific medical resource needs over a 10-day period was derived from several fundamental assumptions. In ordinary circumstances, the mean length of stay in a PICU is 3.9 days, including recovery and death (2) . It is assumed that circumstances unique to a public health emergency would result in a PICU population of higher acuity than under usual circumstances, and thus by definition, patients would require more resources and a longer stay. However, this outcome may be offset by higher mortality rates and more liberal criteria for PICU discharge than usual, both of which would conserve resources and mitigate the length of stay. If a PICU length of stay of 3.9 days is assumed, this corresponds to preparations for an average of 2.6 patients occupying each bed space during the 10-day mass critical care period. For example, a hospital that usually provides a peak of 20 PICU beds should plan a mass critical care target of 60 bed spaces each day, allowing for the care of 156 patients over 10 days.",

Pediatric equipment lists for mass critical care are provided for two types of patients. For purposes of planning, it is arbitrarily assumed that 25% of the patients would have disorders unrelated to the public health emergency and would represent patients across the usual age category distribution, with equipment size distribution as described earlier. However, 75% of the patients would represent a public health emergency surge and would come entirely from any one of the six age categories. Thus, larger equipment stockpiles would be necessary to serve the largest need for each size item, across any of the age groups. This complete list would be more expensive to purchase and would result in some redundant, unused items, but large numbers of patients from any narrow age group would be adequately served (Table 3) .",

Of course, usual complete PICU monitoring, including invasive pressures and end-tidal CO 2 , would be desirable, when available. However, in a mass critical care situation, central venous catheters may be more important for reliable vascular access than for monitoring (5) . Pediatric-size self-inflatable ventilation bags should be provided for infants and children, since infant-size bags cannot be used to ventilate a larger infant, toddler, or child. Cuffed endotracheal tubes are recommended to avoid wasting a small tube when it is necessary to upsize the uncuffed tube that has an unacceptably large airleak. Cuffed tubes also allow a reduced inventory of sizes to accommodate all patient ages. Blood pressure cuffs are assumed to be reusable for the next patient after cleaning. Approximately three laryngoscope sets with all sizes of blades would serve each ten beds and allow time for resterilization. It is important to avoid environmental cold stress in burn patients and small infants.

Even in a stand-alone pediatric hospital, it may be necessary to adapt transport ventilators, anesthesia ventilators, and bilevel positive pressure breathing devices for use in the PICU.

Planning in these centers should include a regional stockpile of oscillators that could be accessed during a major surge. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation is a technique that could be learned and adopted in a crisis requiring a surge in capacity to care for critically ill children with the guidance of regional experts in this mode of ventilation. However, in the event of a pandemic of respiratory illness, the use of conventional ventilators allows for a greater number of patients to be treated.",

            "text": "The use of ECMO in a mass critical care setting is more problematic given that, as currently structured, it requires more resource utilization above and beyond the amount needed for conventional mechanical ventilation or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. ECMO has been used in the ordinary surge circumstances of the 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 Pandemic, although the adult task force did not address the use of ECMO as an option for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome/hypoxic respiratory failure during a mass critical care situation. Despite this, it was extensively used in adults during the 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 epidemic in Australasia (7). ECMO is offered in the treatment of single-system pulmonary disease, unresponsive to conventional treatment, in many tertiary care pediatric centers. The overall survival of 48% where it was used in pediatric patients during the 2009 pandemic will continue to make this a controversial issue (www.elso.med.umich.edu/H1N1Registry). The accepted standard for staffing of one ECMO patient is one nurse and one ECMO specialist per patient, as well as the immediate availability of a senior specialist in pediatric critical care. This could be altered to a single-caregiver model in the event of a surge situation. However, unlike the 2009 pandemic surge, mass critical care involves a tripling of PICU capacity with altered levels of care, which would involve one PICU nurse supervising non-PICU supplement providers caring for perhaps three to six patients. It is therefore unlikely that ECMO would be available as a therapeutic option. A model of decision making for pandemics of acute respiratory illness based on available resources is provided in Figure  1 .",

However, there is little experience of mass critical care during pandemics of respiratory illness in children on which to base planning assumptions for equipment and supplies. The severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic in 2003 resulted in very few seriously ill children admitted to intensive care units (8) . The 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 pandemics of April to June 2009 in the northern and southern hemispheres revealed that the highest age-specific incidence of the disease was in children younger than 4 yrs. Approximately 10% to 20% of children admitted to pediatric hospitals were transferred to intensive care, and the majority of these required positive-pressure ventilation (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Many PICUs experienced a doubling of children admitted with respiratory failure, and a significant number also had hemodynamic compromise compared with the usual numbers of patients with seasonal flu. The experience in the second wave of the disease seen in North America in October and November 2009 was similar and in no instance invoked a mass critical care response.",
