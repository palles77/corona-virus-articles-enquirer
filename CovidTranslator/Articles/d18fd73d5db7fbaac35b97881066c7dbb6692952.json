We sought to characterize their perceptions and identify reasons underlying inappropriate use. Methods: We conducted 12 focus groups with nurses and nursing assistants at 4 medical centers. We analyzed the thematic content of 73 discrete \"stories\" told by focus group participants. Results: We identified 5 story types surrounding RPE use: 1) policies are known and seen during work routines; 2) during protocol lapses, use is reinforced through social norms; 3) clinical experiences sometimes supersede protocol adherence; 4) when risk perception is high, we found concern regarding accessing RPE; and 5) HCWs in emergency departments were viewed as not following protocol because risk was ever-present. Discussion: HCWs were aware of the importance of RPE and protocols for using it, and these supported use when protocol lapses occurred. However, protocol adherence was undermined by clinical experience, perceived risk, and the distinct context of the emergency department where patients continually arrive with incomplete or delayed diagnoses. Conclusions: Protocols, visual cues, and social norms contribute to a culture of safety. This culture can be undermined when HCWs experience diagnostic uncertainty or they mistrust the protocol and instead rely on their clinical experiences.",

Importantly, whereas some responses may not be \"true,\" the perception of their veracity may still inform behaviors and highlights the use of our qualitative approach. For example, transmission routes described by an HCW may not be biologically plausible, yet this understanding may inform RPE use.",

However, during data review, we noted the Health Belief Model, which is a useful heuristic to organize the data, was insufficient to fully capture the rich narrative content of the data. We noted data were comprised of short stories relating to events surrounding RPE use. To take advantage of this data and reduce disaggregation of the findings, we organized the data into \"story units,\" defined as segments of text with a beginning, middle, and end. 17 Our team subsequently analysed transcripts looking for discrete \"story units.\" Two team members independently reviewed each transcript and delineated the stories using a template. Each templated story was given a title, summary, and discussed by the full team. We then conducted an inductive thematic analysis of these stories, sorting them into different story types.

Nearby colleagues, observing the potentially dangerous situation, quickly reminded the first responding HCWs of the urgent need to don masks. Another example of this type was a food service employee, apparently oblivious to precaution signs, walking into a patient room without the required RPE. Similarly, HCWs requested additional training for food service employees. These instances suggest the HCWs felt empowered to speak up to colleagues when safety standards were not met. This indicates a pervasive safety culture, in which following protocols is habituated. This culture is created, as we and others have found, 20 through trainings, leadership addressing safety concerns, peer influence, and tangible resources like accessible equipment. HCWs appear to have the training to identify \"moments of risk\" and feel empowered to take immediate action to mitigate them. This type of culture and HCW empowerment has been associated with robust patient safety practices. 21, 22 Achieving the appropriate cultural among HCWs, however, has been shown to be challenging in hospital systems perhaps undermined, as we found, by inaccessible equipment.",

Several HCWs we spoke with talked about wearing N95s when the protocol specified a surgical mask. This was because they suspected, based on their clinical experience, that the patient might later be diagnosed with a respiratory infection. One nurse stated: \"I'm not gonna, you know, make that mistake again.\" This was attributed to, in part, experiences that HCWs had in which they had initially worn droplet protection, only to learn that the patient was later diagnosed with an airborne infection, which would require a higher level of RPE.

Overuse of RPE may also result in equipment being unavailable when needed, as we and others have found. 19 Moreover, availability is an important factor in adherence. 23 When HCWs do not trust the diagnosis, huddles could help team members communicate about risks, address potential concerns, and lead to consistent and appropriate RPE use. 24 Team huddles are a proven management and communication approach 25 that could be used to review emerging patient diagnostic data and discuss with team members how to best use RPE for the unique situation. This deliberate review and clarification of risk levels may lead to HCWs' increased trust in infection control systems and belief that the hospital is motivated not by finances, but instead HCW safety.",

Patients coming into the ED arrive without a diagnosis, which puts HCWs at greater risk of exposure to infectious agents. Yet, perplexingly, this seems to have desensitized these HCWs. Some HCWs reported that even after an ED patient had received a diagnosis warranting use of RPE, ED staff might continue to forgo RPE, because, as one HCW noted, the staff believed they had \"already been exposed.\" HCWs working in the ED may perceive that exposure risks are omnipresent, with RPE being unable to protect from the myriad of potential exposures. This is problematic because these HCWs may habituate to not wearing RPE when protocol requires use. Other research has shown lower adherence to personal protective equipment, including N95s, among HCWs in EDs. 23 Our findings were consistent with several domains in the Health Belief Model. 11 For example, we found that HCW's desire to wear RPE may increase in the presence of symptomatic, but undiagnosed, patients, a feature of perceived susceptibility. RPE use was also informed by perceptions of the seriousness of patient symptoms or disease. Additionally, the Health Belief Model may provide guidance for strengthening safety systems, such as providing cues to action (eg, signs, carts) to help initiate donning RPE. However, whereas the Health Belief Model was useful in developing the focus group guide, and used to guide parts of the analysis, it had limitations; our additional use of an inductive analytic approach was useful where the Health Belief Model was lacking. For example, we encountered stories around RPE availability or rapidly developing emergent situations that may have precluded HCWs' abilities to adequately process the severity and susceptibility. The Health Belief Model was originally developed with the individual in mind to understand what influenced their likelihood of getting vaccinated. This origin helps explain why it was limited for explaining HCW behavior because HCWs are enmeshed in complexities of health care facilities and systems.",

Study participants were limited to RNs and NAs; other clinicians, staff, and patient and family perspectives were not represented. The timing of our study was unique given the Ebola outbreak and therefore increased sensitivity to RPE use. Therefore, we may have heard greater concerns about RPE availability and use. Moreover, our data collection method (focus groups) may have led to social desirability biases, with reluctance to report nonadherence.",

            "text": "Recent Ebola and SARs outbreaks remind us that a large-scale pandemic is always possible. Adherence to respiratory precautions may become critical with little advanced notice. Although government and public health agencies should continue to develop data-driven protocols, hospitals need to assess their own unique context, 27 including local norms, particularly in the ED where patients arrive without a diagnosis or HCWs may not fully trust the protocols for RPE use. Our data provide insight into reasons for RPE nonadherence; importantly, these are to a large extent modifiable. Early appraisal of facility-level-or ward-level in the case of the ED-vulnerabilities in patient safety culture surrounding RPE use could be a useful strategy for ensuring improved adherence during high incidence respiratory illness seasons when RPE use is critical.",
