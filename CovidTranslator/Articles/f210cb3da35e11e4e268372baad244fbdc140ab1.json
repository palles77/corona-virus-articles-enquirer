BALB/c mice were infected with MHV3, subsequently labelled in vivo with 3SS-methionine, and then the liver preparations from both infected and non-infected animals were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comparisons of the patterns by computer image analysis revealed 17 gene products which increased, and 8 gene products which decreased, upon virus infection in their two-dimensional gel spot intensity. We conclude that during MHV3 infection of a susceptible strain of mice, a major modification in protein synthesis occurs. The pattern alterations were not related to the virus gene products but were mostly endogenous mouse proteins. Whether these proteins are a result of a defance attempt by the animal, or are dictated by the virus in order to prevent a protective response from happening, remains to be shown.",

The changes in the concentration of plasma proteins are an important factor of the systemic response (Kushner et al., 1982) . Synthesis or degradation of several plasma protons are affected during infection and the change in components of the acute phase reactants is a prominent feature of the response. \"Positive\" and \"negative reactants\" are terms that have been proposed to describe the increase or decrease in the abundance of individual components during the acute phase (Kushner, 1981) . A wide variety of different stimuli can trigger an acute-phase reaction, and some of the inducers evoke a distinct response pattern (Allen et al., 1982) . A number of other changes in protein synthesis have been implicated, but have not been revealed until now, since no direct, sensitive methods were available for the detection of polypeptides present at concentrations considerably lower than those of acute-phase proteins.",

A powerful and also convenient procedure for identifying such changes is the labelling of the entire mouse with 35S-methionine during the course of infection. The experiment requires a relatively high dose of 35S-methionine which, as described earlier (Pluschke and Lefkovits, 1984) , consists of injecting 1 mCi of 35S-methionine i.v. into a mouse. Such treatment provides a pulse of radioisotope for the whole organism, and all the relevant biosynthetic processes make use of the provided radioisotope. The consequence is that not only do the cells become efficiently labelled but also the body fluid will contain proteins which were labelled intracellularly and then secreted into the extracellular space. Obviously the labelled polypeptides will be considerably diluted when secreted into the body fluids and will be detectable only above certain threshold concentrations. One hour after i.v. administration of 35S-methionine, sufficient labelling was achieved so that a 2D gel exposed for one month revealed several hundreds of spots on a radiofluorograph.",

The label introduced into the animal is diluted in the body fluid (estimated volume 5 ml) and in the cytoplasmic content upon uptake into the cell, and the specific activity of the label is profoundly decreased by the rich amino acid pool of the animal. Thus, only those proteins which are synthesized at the highest rate will incorporate enough label to yield detectable spots. Nevertheless, most of these 300 spots could not be detected by any other means than by this methodology. Fine changes can be revealed only by in vitro labelling.",
