Originally, the use of these genetic screens was limited to genetically tractable model organisms, such as yeasts, fruit flies, roundworms and zebrafish, and relied on the use of X-rays or chemical mutagens to introduce mutations. These forward genetic screens have markedly contributed to our understanding of many fundamental biological processes 1-4 , but their application to cultured mammalian cells was challenging. With technological advances such as RNAi and insertional mutagenesis in human haploid cells, it became possible to disrupt gene expression on a genome scale in mammalian cell culture 5-7 . Recently, the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system has been engineered to efficiently induce knockout mutations in almost any cell type, which has revolutionized biological research 8-10 (BOX 1). In contrast to gene knockdown approaches, such as RNAi, the knockout of alleles by CRISPR-Cas often results in more marked phenotypes, a greater signal-to-noise ratio and the identification of fewer false-positives 11-14 . Knockout alleles are generated by the endonuclease Cas9, which is directed to a specific genomic region by a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) through Watson-Crick base pairing. Cas9 creates a double-strand break (DSB) at the target site, which is then repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). This often results in a frameshift mutation and the expression of truncated or non-functional proteins. The ease of Cas9 targeting to specific loci, combined with the design of multiplexed pools of sgRNAs that span the entire human genome 14-17 , has enabled the genome-scale identification of host factors that are crucial for virus replication.",

Recently, genome-scale CRISPR-Cas screens have been used to identify host factors that are required for virus replication, including the replication of clinically relevant viruses such as Zika virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus and hepatitis C virus. In this Review, we discuss the technical aspects of genome-scale knockout screens using CRISPR-Cas technology, and we compare these screens with alternative genetic screening technologies. The relative ease of use and reproducibility of CRISPR-Cas make it a powerful tool for probing virus-host interactions and for identifying new antiviral targets.

To identify entry receptors, a cell line that is refractory to infection is typically transduced with a complementary DNA library (cDNA library) derived from a cell type that is permissive to infection. For example, claudin 1 (CLDN1) 18 and occludin (OCLN) 19 were identified as entry receptors for HCV by transducing a non-permissive cell line with a cDNA library derived from hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition to discovering receptors, an unbiased expression screen also discovered that SEC14-like protein 2 (SEC14L2), which is a cytosolic lipid-binding protein, enhances the replication of clinical strains of HCV 20 . Furthermore, a library of ~380 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was used to identify key proteins that are important for innate immune defences against several DNA and RNA viruses 21, 22 . In addition to these screens, in a continuing effort, comprehensive cDNA libraries that contain all annotated ORFs from humans have been cloned",

            "text": "The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system that protects bacteria and archaea against bacteriophages and plasmids. CRISPR-Cas immunity is mediated by CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a Cas endonculease that targets genetic elements 141 . The mode of action consists of three distinct steps: acquisition, expression and interference (see the figure) . In the acquisition step, foreign nucleic acids are directionally integrated, as new CRISPR spacers, into a CRISPR array that is separated by repeat sequences, thus creating a memory of invading genetic elements 142 (see the figure, step 1). In the expression step, the CRISPR locus is transcribed into a pre-CRISPR RNA transcript (pre-crRNA), which is then processed into a mature crRNA that contains partial CRISPR spacer sequences joined to partial CRISPR repeats 132 . The CRISPR locus also encodes a transactivating RNA (tracrRNA) that has complementarity to the repeat regions of crRNA transcripts 143 . In addition to the CRISPR array, a single or multiple Cas nucleases (for example, Cas9) are encoded by the CRISPR locus (see the figure, step 2). In the interference stage, a crRNA-tracrRNA hybrid is formed through binding of the complementary repeat region sequences, and this RNA hybrid guides the Cas nuclease towards complementary DNA sequences, which leads to the targeting and cleaving of invading genetic elements 144 . Most CRISPR effector proteins rely on a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM; for example, NGG for Cas9) in the targeted nucleic acid. The PAM is essential for recognition, cleavage and the distinction between self and non-self DNA [145] [146] [147] (see the figure, step 3). For Cas9, perfect complementarity will drive a conformational change in the endonuclease that leads to a cleavage-competent structural state [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] . The protein and RNA components of the Streptococcus pyogenes class 2 CRISPR system have been adapted to function in eukaryotes, including in human cells. A human-codon-optimized Cas9 is fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to direct Cas9 to the nucleus in mammalian cells [8] [9] [10] . To generate single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for genome editing that mimic the natural crRNA-tracrRNA hybrid, crRNA-like sequences are fused to a partial tracrRNA through a synthetic stem-loop.",

Initial approaches that used RNAi have provided valu able insights into virus-host relationships 24 . In contrast to RNAi, which leads to the partial depletion of expression for a specific gene, recent technological advances have made it possible to completely disrupt gene expression (TABLE 1) . One approach, termed haploid genetic screening, relies on insertional mutagenesis of genes in cultured haploid cell lines. For example, retroviral gene traps that contain a splice acceptor site can integrate into the host genome, leading to the expression of truncated mRNA transcripts 7 . The complete ablation of gene expression can have marked effects on virus replication and enables the identification of the most crucial host factors for virus infection. Insertional mutagenesis in haploid cells has been used to discover essential receptors for several viruses, including Ebola virus and Lassa virus 25, 26 . Both viruses use abundant lysosomal proteins as receptors. The interaction between the Ebola virus glyco protein and its receptor Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1) is triggered by cathepsin cleavage 27, 28 , whereas the Lassa virus glycoprotein interacts with its receptor, lysosomeassociated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1), following acidification of the endosome. Subsequent structural studies defined the binding interface between the viral glycoprotein and NPC1 . Interestingly, several mutations arose in the host-binding site of the viral glycoprotein during the 2013-2016 Ebola virus epidemic.",

CRISPR-Cas genome editing has been reported for a wide range of cell lines that can be infected with many viruses. However, large-scale genetic screens in which the sgRNAs are introduced into the cells in a pooled manner have some limitations. To ensure the appropriate representation of each of the sgRNAs in the pool, numerous cells are transduced and undergo phenotypic selection. In practice, many transformed cell lines will be suitable for generating a mutagenized cell library; however, primary cells have a limited proliferative capacity, and it is therefore more challenging to transduce and expand these cells in large numbers.

In a pooled screen, in which mutant cells are cultured together, the selection can be extremely stringent because of the requirement that resistant cells survive multiple rounds of infection. Therefore, this screening method identifies genes for which disruption causes marked phenotypes. Strong selection conditions in which >99% of cells die from infection are preferred. Although this high stringency increases the confidence in the candidate genes identified, other genes that have subtler effects on virus infection may be missed. Decreasing the stringency could help to identify these genes. Strategies to achieve this include the use of naturally attenuated virus strains or the use of antiviral compounds during selection.

The sgRNA integrations are PCR-amplified and sequenced by next-generation sequencing to quantify their relative abundances. The level of sgRNA enrichment in phenotypically selected cells compared with that in unselected cells is determined by comparing the number of reads that map to specific sgRNAs in the different cell populations. To normalize for differences in sequencing depth between populations, the number of reads that map to each specific sgRNA is divided by the total number of reads.

The remaining ~90% of genes can be tested in genetic screens because they do not affect cell growth or viability; however, this figure is likely to be an underestimate because the list of 'essential genes' includes genes that only moderately affect cell growth and could therefore be included in the screens. For example, in haploid and CRISPR-Cas screens for host factors that are crucial for DENV replication, multiple subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (OST complex) were identified 61 despite the genes that encode these subunits being classified as essential genes 60 . Another important consideration is the coverage of the genome. Notably, sgRNA libraries are designed according to the presence of annotated genes in reference genomes (~20,000 genes in humans). The increasing number of independent sgRNAs (now at 4-12 per gene) and improved sequence rules for cleavage efficiency make current sgRNA libraries more reliable than early libraries for probing the entire human genome, thus minimizing false-negative results. By contrast, haploid genetic screens rely on retroviral insertional mutagenesis and do not require genome annotation. Retroviral integration is not random and occurs more frequently in actively transcribed chromatin 62 , which biases the insertions towards genes. Indeed, mapping of insertion sites in gene trap screens revealed insertions in ~70% of all annotated genes and ~98% of expressed genes 63 . Recently, more extensive mapping efforts in HAP1 cells showed that >90% of all annotated genes contained insertions, with a median of 525 independent gene trap insertion events per annotated gene 60 . This high number of knockout events increases the power of identifying signal over noise.",

            "text": "Catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) can be fused to transcriptional activators or repressors to modulate gene expression without introducing irreversible mutations into the genome 154, 155 . Approaches that use dCas9 for this purpose are commonly referred to as CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) 156 . To achieve transcriptional repression (that is, CRISPRi), chromatin-modifying repressor domains, such as the Kr\u00fcppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, are fused to dCas9 and are recruited to transcription start sites. CRISPRi-mediated and RNAi-mediated knockdown both lead to the downregulation of gene expression, albeit through different molecular mechanisms. CRISPRi occurs by inhibiting transcription, whereas RNAi degrades mRNAs in the cytoplasm. CRISPRa relies on the fusion of dCas9 to multiple repeats of the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain (VP64 or VP160) to enhance transcription at target sites. Alternatively, in the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) library, MS2 RNA aptamers added to the tetraloop and second stem-loop of the sgRNA additionally recruit a fusion construct of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein (MCP), the nuclear factor-\u03baB subunit p65 and heat shock factor protein 1 to enhance Cas9-mediated gene expression 157 . CRISPRa and SAM libraries are an alternative approach for gain-of-function screens (FIG. 1) , which traditionally rely on complementary DNA (cDNA) overexpression libraries 23 . The activation of endogenous gene expression has the advantage of not being limited by conventional molecular cloning techniques to generate cDNA constructs and can be used to increase the expression of different isoforms from the same gene. Although Cas9-mediated gene activation has not been used in the context of virus-host studies, it may be used to identify antiviral restriction factors or host factors that are expressed at very low levels and are required for virus replication. The high concordance in identified genes between the two different technologies underscores the power and reliability of knockout screens.",

For example, the OST complex was found to be required for viral RNA synthesis, but not for viral entry and translation 61 . The OST complex catalyses the N-linked glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins. In mammalian cells, two distinct OST multiprotein complexes are formed, each composed of a catalytic subunit (one of two paralogues, STT3A or STT3B) and accessory subunits 72 . Both isoforms are individually required for the replication of DENV, as knockout of either STT3A or STT3B resulted in complete abrogation of DENV replication. Other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including ZIKV, are exclusively dependent on the STT3A isoform for viral RNA replication, which indicates a specific but divergent virus-host interaction (FIG. 2) . Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of STT3A and STT3B was dispensable for virus replication, because catalytically inactive mutant proteins were able to restore DENV replication in the knockout cells, which indicates that the OST complex has an unconventional role in DENV replication. The OST complex was found to bind to multiple non-structural viral proteins that form the RNA synthesis complex at the ER 61 , which suggests that the OST complex acts as a scaffold to coordinate the assembly of a functional DENV RNA replication complex.",

Whereas mosquito-borne flavi viruses have a dependence on ER proteins, screening with HCV, which is a more distantly related member of the family Flaviviridae, revealed non-overlapping hits, including entry receptors CD81, OCLN and CLDN1, the liver-specific microRNA miR-122 and several RNA-binding proteins and metabolic enzymes 61 (FIG. 2) . One of the most significant hits was ELAVL1, an RNA-binding protein that is involved in mRNA stabilization 79 . HCV RNA replication was markedly reduced in ELAVL1-knockout cells, whereas RNA replication for other RNA viruses (for example, DENV and poliovirus) was unaffected. The HCV screens also uncovered an unexpected link between intracellular FAD levels and HCV RNA replication. The enzymes riboflavin kinase (RFK) and FAD synthase (FLAD1), which are involved in the conversion of riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ) to FAD, were found to be crucial for the replication of HCV. Lumiflavin, an inhibitor of cellular uptake of riboflavin, potently inhibited viral RNA replication, which indicates that the modulation of intracellular FAD levels could be explored as an antiviral treatment. Host-targeted antiviral therapeutics may become an effective strategy to control virus replication because they may present a higher genetic barrier for resistant mutants to evolve than virus-targeting antivirals, and they have the potential to inhibit a broader range of viruses 65 . For example, cyclophilin A (CYPA) is a host factor that is required for HCV replication and also promotes HIV infection [80] [81] [82] . CYPA inhibitors have advanced to phase II/III clinical trials for the treatment of HCV infection, and their use is also being explored to treat other viral infections 83 .",

Although their mechanism of entry and cellular receptor remain unknown, carbohydrates -in particular, the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) -have been shown to have a role in human norovirus entry 84 . Unbiased genetic CRISPR-Cas screens led to the discovery of CD300LF (also known as CLM1) as a proteinaceous receptor for murine noro virus 85, 86 . CD300LF knockout abolished murine noro virus infection in mouse cell lines and in a mouse model of murine norovirus infection. Moreover, the expression of mouse CD300LF in human cells made them susceptible to murine norovirus infection. The discovery of a key host receptor that is necessary and sufficient for the binding of murine norovirus raises the possibility that human noroviruses also require a specific proteinaceous receptor or receptors. The recent development of a more reliable in vitro infection model for human noroviruses 87 combined with CRISPR-Cas technology could lead to a better understanding of the entry pathway that is used by human noroviruses and to the development of entry inhibitors.",

CRISPR-Cas tools have been used to generate gene drives that have the potential to diminish mosquito populations 120, 121 . Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas technology could be used to treat persistent virus infections, such as infections with HIV, HBV, HCV and herpes simplex virus [122] [123] [124] [125] . Recently, HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the hallmark of persistent HBV infection, has been successfully targeted in cell culture Figure 3 | CRISPR-Cas applications beyond genetic screening. CRISPR-Cas genome editing enables the generation of in vitro and in vivo models to study viral pathogenesis. The technology is not limited to engineering model organisms, such as mice, fruit flies and roundworms, but can also be applied to non-model organisms, such as pigs, macaques, ferrets, chickens, ticks, bats and mosquitoes. CRISPR-Cas technology is also useful for engineering the genomes of large DNA viruses, such as poxviruses. Catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) proteins that are fused to fluorophores may be useful to track viral nucleic acids in cells 162 . CRISPR-Cas technology could lead to the development of new approaches to treat virus infections and prevent transmission, including the development of gene drive systems to eradicate viral disease vectors, the direct targeting to inactivate viral gene expression, the identification of druggable host proteins that are required for virus replication, and elucidating the mechanisms of action of antivirals. cccDNA, covalently closed circular DNA; HBV, hepatitis B virus; sgRNA, single-guide RNA.",

Combining CRISPR-Cas technology with advances in single-cell profiling could lead to better measurements of virus replication dynamics [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] . Furthermore, a screening strategy that investigates epistatic relationships (for example by combining haploid and CRISPR-Cas mutagenesis 60 ), will enable the systematic analysis of functional interdependencies between the host genes that are most crucial for virus infection.

Genetic screens can identify host factors that promote virus replication, as well as antiviral restriction factors. For example, in a loss-of-function screen, knockout of a viral receptor in a permissive cell line will make the cell resistant to the virus infection. By contrast, in a gain-of-function screen, overexpression of the viral receptor in a non-permissive cell line will enable virus infection. Various technologies are available for genome-wide screening. Loss-of-function screens can be carried out using a haploid mutagenesis (in a 1n cell type) or CRISPR-Cas knockout approaches, whereas gain-of-function screens use CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) or ectopic overexpression. Target cells are mutated by delivering retroviral gene trap or lentiviral expression constructs, which can either disrupt or lead to gene expression. The pooled mutagenized cell population is then subjected to a virus infection assay, in which either the cells are infected by the virus of interest, or a subgenomic viral reporter is introduced by transduction or transfection. Virus-resistant cells are selected either by surviving virus-induced cell death or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analyses enable the enrichment of CRISPR single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), gene traps or complementary DNA (cDNA) insertions to be determined.
