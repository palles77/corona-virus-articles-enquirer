Six primers were designed to amplify the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PEDV. The optimization, sensitivity, and specificity of the RT-LAMP were investigated. The results showed that the optimal reaction condition for RT-LAMP amplifying PEDV N gene was achieved at 63\u00b0C for 50 min. The RT-LAMP assay was more sensitive than gelbased RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. It was capable of detecting PEDV from clinical samples and differentiating PEDV from Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, Porcine rotavirus, Porcine pseudorabies virus, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and Avian infectious bronchitis virus.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an infectious enteric disease characterized by acute enteritis and diarrhea in pigs, and the infection is more severe in neonates [1] . At present, PED has been a major concern in the swine industry, particularly, in the Asia and Europe, resulting in large economic losses [2] [3] [4] . The causative agent of PED is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped and single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae [5] . Coronavirus comprises three major viral structural proteins: spike (S, 180-220 kDa), membrane (M, 27-32 kDa), and nucleocapsid (N, 55-58 kDa) proteins [5, 6] . The S protein is a major viral antigen, binds to a cellular receptor for virus attachment to enter target cells and mediates viral attachment to target cells [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . The M protein is a trans-membrane protein [14] and it is involved in the assembly process of viral nucleocapsid and membrane [15, 16] . The N protein of coronaviruses is a phosphorylated protein that interacts with virus genomic RNA, forming a helical ribonucleoprotein [17] . Therefore, it plays important roles in viral genome transcription, core formation and virus assembly [18] . Viral N protein is also conserved and can be used as a diagnostic target for detecting viral infection.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a recently developed DNA amplification method [19] . LAMP uses four to six primers that recognize six to eight regions of target DNA, in conjunction with the enzyme Bst polymerase, which has strand-displacement activity. The synchronization DNA synthesis by these primers maintains the specificity of the method. Interestingly, the amplification step can be performed under isothermal conditions, resulting in the synthesis of a large amount of DNA. LAMP proceeds when the forward inner primer (FIP) anneals to the complementary region in the target DNA and initiates the first-strand synthesis. Next, the outer forward primer (F3) hybridists and displaces the first strand, forming a loop structure at one end. The resulting single-stranded DNA serves as a template for backward inner primer (BIP)-initiated DNA synthesis and subsequent outer backward (B3)-primed strand-displacement DNA synthesis. The formed dumbbell-shaped DNA stem loop structure serves as a template for subsequent hybridization between one inner primer and the loop, initiating the displacement DNA synthesis. The LAMP method may form the original stem loop and a new stem loop that is twice as long as the original one. The final products are stem loop DNAs with several inverted repeats of the target DNA and cauliflower-like structures bearing multiple loops [19] .",

Even now, the viral titer of PEDV in cell culture is still low. Other diagnostic methods for detecting PEDV include immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, dot-blot hybridization, RT-PCR, and real-time RT-PCR [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .

The isothermal conditions required for LAMP can be provided with a conventional water bath or heat block. Therefore, the current method can be applied less in well-equipped laboratories and fields for rapid detection of PEDV. In general, the LAMP can be carried out under isothermal conditions (60-65\u00b0C). In this study, the authors optimized the reaction conditions of the RT-LAMP by performing the test at different temperatures and time points. Subsequently, its sensitivity was compared with that of RT-PCR. The results showed that the RT-LAMP specific for PEDV was approx. 10,000 times sensitive than the RT-PCR. Nevertheless, it is necessary to screen other optimal primers to further compare the sensitivity between RT-LAMP and RT-PCR in the future. Moreover, the sensitivity between the RT-LAMP and conventional ELISA was compared using the inactivated PEDV as template. The former is more sensitive than the latter. Two reports have pointed out that the detection limit of RT-PCR for PEDV was 10 2.0 TCID 50 /ml [29, 30] . Detection limit of a commercially available ELISA kit (Jinma, Shanghai) used in China was 0.1 ng/ml, which was the same as the detection limit of the RT-LAMP developed in this study. This result further confirmed the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP for amplifying the N gene of PEDV. Nonetheless, when the authors used these methods to detect PEDV from clinical samples, the sensitivity of RT-LAMP was somewhat higher than RT-PCR and had a similar sensitivity with ELISA. More experiments are needed to clarify this point in the future; however, the RT-LAMP still has advantages including simplicity, rapidity, and convenience.",

IBV and PRRSV belong to the Group III coronavirus and arterivirus, respectively; however, both viruses belong to the order Nidovirales [32, 33] . The structural similarity between the N proteins of IBV and PRRSV suggests that members of the Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae families share a mechanism of filamentous nucleocapsid formation, with suitable alterations necessary to interact specifically with their respective genomes [34, 35] . PrV and PRV are members of the families Herpesviridae and Reoviridae, respectively. These viruses such as PEDV, TGEV, PRV, PrV, or PRRSV may cause co-infection in pigs. The results showed that the RT-LAMP is successful only if the PEDV served as template, indicating that the established method is specific and applicable for differentiation diagnosis. To the knowledge, this is the first report regarding the establishment and optimization of a RT-LAMP for PEDV N gene. The assay may be useful for the clinical diagnosis of PEDV infection. ",
