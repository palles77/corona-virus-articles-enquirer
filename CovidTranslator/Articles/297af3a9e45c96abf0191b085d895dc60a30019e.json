Fast, affordable sequencing of pathogen genomes -now a staple of the public health microbiology laboratory in well-resourced settings -can affect each of these areas. Coupling genomic diagnostics and epidemiology to innovative digital disease detection platforms raises the possibility of an open, global, digital pathogen surveillance system. When informed by a One Health approach, in which human, animal and environmental health are considered together, such a genomics-based system has profound potential to improve public health in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity.",

As with prior crises, in the wake of Ebola, multiple commissions have offered suggestions for essential reforms 8, 9 . Most focus on systems-level change, such as funding research and development or creating a centralized pandemic preparedness and response agency. However, they also call for enhanced molecular diagnostic and surveillance capacity coupled to data-sharing frameworks. This hints at an emerging paradigm for rapid outbreak response, one that employs new tools for pathogen genome sequencing and epidemiological analysis (FIG. 1) and that can be deployed anywhere. In this model, portable, in-country genomic diagnostics are targeted to key settings for routine human, animal and environ mental surveillance or rapidly deployed to a setting with a nascent outbreak. Within our increasingly digital landscape, wherein a clinical sample can be transformed into a stream of data for rapid analysis and dissemination in a matter of hours, we face a tremendous opportunity to more proactively respond to disease events. However, the potential benefits of such a system are not guaranteed, and many obstacles remain.",

With its untargeted approach to sequencing, clinical metagenomics can cross disciplines in a way that clinical microbiology struggles to -identifying viral, bacterial, fungal and other eukaryotic pathogens in a single assay 11 and coupling pathogen detection to pathogen discovery. Given the current high cost of the technique -conservatively estimated at several thousand dollars -it is most often used when dealing with potentially lethal infections that fail the conventional diagnostic paradigm, such as the recent diagnosis of an unusual case of meningoencephalitis caused by the amoeboid parasite Balamuthia man drillaris 12 or the diagnosis and treatment of neuroleptospirosis in a critically unwell teenager 13 . In the latter case, despite a high index of suspicion for infection, Leptospira santa rosai was not detected by culture or PCR, as the diagnostic primer sequences were eventually found to be a poor match to the genome of the pathogen. Intravenous antibiotic therapy resulted in rapid recovery. In such an example, the costs are easily justified, particularly when offset against the cost of a stay in an intensive treatment unit. However, routine diagnostic metagenomics is currently limited to a handful of clinical research laboratories worldwide; it is therefore regarded as a 'test of last resort' and kept in reserve for vexing diagnostic conundrums. Substantial practical challenges hinder the adoption of metagenomics for diagnostics (FIG. 2) (reviewed in depth in REF. 11) . Chief among these is analytic sensitivity, which depends on pathogen factors (for example, genome size, ease of lysis and life cycle); analytic factors (for example, the completeness of reference databases and the potential to mistake a target for a close genetic relative); and sample factors (for example, pathogen abundance within a sample and contaminating background DNA). As an example of a problematic sample, during Zika surveillance, attempts to perform un targeted metagenomics sequencing on blood yielded few, or in some cases zero, reads owing to low viral titres 14 . Targetenrichment technologies (reviewed in REF. 15 ) such as bait probes can be employed, but even these were unsuccessful at recovering whole Zika genomes, necessitating PCR enrichment 14 . In addition to sensitivity, universal pathogen detection through clinical metagenomics is complicated by specificity issues arising from misclassification or contaminated reagents, the challenge of reproducing results from a complex clinical workflow, nucleic acid stability under varying assay conditions, ever-changing bioinformatics workflows and cost.",

Recent studies have used metagenomics in common presentations, including sepsis 16 , pneumonia 17 , urinary tract infections 18 and eye infections 19 . These have generally yielded promising results, albeit typically at a lower sensitivity than conventional tests and at a much greater cost. Despite these problems, two factors will drive sequencing to eventually become routine clinical practice. First, the ever-decreasing cost of sequencing coupled with the potential for cost savings achieved by using a single diagnostic modality versus tens or hundreds of different diagnostic assays -each potentially requiring specific instrumentation, reagents, validation and labour -is attractive from a laboratory operations perspective. Second, and perhaps most compelling, is the additional information afforded by genomics, including the ability to predict virulence or drug resistance phenotypes, the ability to detect polymicrobial infections and phylogenetic reconstruction for outbreak analysis.",

Compared with bench-top instruments, the absence of a rolling service contract or regular engineer visits makes it theoretically possible to scale this platform out to potentially unlimited numbers of labora tories. Importantly, the MinION has been used in field situations, including in diagnostic tent labora tories during the Ebola epidemic 22, 23 and in a roving busbased mobile laboratory in Brazil as part of the ZiBRA project 3, 24 . Others have taken the MinION to more extreme environments where even the smallest traditional bench-top sequencer could not go, including the Arctic 25 and Antarctic 26 , a deep mine 27 and zero gravity aboard the reduced-gravity aircraft (nicknamed the 'Vomit Comet') 28 and the International Space Station 29 . However, this technology is not yet a panacea; remaining challenges include high DNA or RNA input requirements (currently hundreds of nanograms), which often necessitate PCR-based amplification approaches; a flow cell cost of $500, keeping the cost per sample high despite multiplexing approaches; and high error rates, which require that genomes are sequenced to high coverage for single nucleotide polymorphism-based analysis and analysed at the signal level. Moreover, although the long reads produced by the MinION overcome a number of challenges in assembling eukaryotic microbial pathogen genomes, such as the presence of discrete chromosomes or long repetitive regions, the upstream nucleic acid extraction steps required to obtain genomic DNA vary across microbial domains and might necessitate reagents and equipment far less portable than the MinION.",

The many genomic epidemiology studies from the Ebola outbreak (reviewed in REF. 48 ) used bench-top and portable sequencing platforms to reveal outbreak-level events and epidemic-level trends. Real-time analyses published around the peak of the epidemic suggested the following: the outbreak probably arose from a single introduction into humans and not repeated zoonotic introductions 49, 50 ; sexual transmission had a previously unrecognized role in maintaining transmission chains 51 ; and survivor transmission -another un recognized phenomenon -contributed to disease flare-ups later in the outbreak 52 . The first sequencing efforts, all of which had an effect on the epidemiological response in real time, unfolded months into the epidemic. Had they been deployed earlier, we can only speculate as to their potential impact. Arguably, the most compelling use of early sequencing would have been to provide a definitive Ebola diagnosis in this previously unaffected region of West Africa. However, even after the outbreak was underway, sequencing could have benefited the public health response. For example, ruling out bush meat as a source of repeated viral introductions could have changed public health messaging campaigns from avoiding bush meat to the importance of hygiene and safe funeral practices 53 , potentially averting some cases. Portable sequencing and phylodynamic approaches are currently being deployed in the ongoing Zika epidemic; whether the real-time reporting of genomic findings is able to alter the course of a vector-borne epidemic remains to be seen.",

Indeed, proof-of-concept metagenomics studies have revealed the presence of antibiotic resistance genes 59 , human-specific viruses 60 61 . Most were zoonotic in origin, and over one-quarter had been detected in non-human species many years before being identified as human pathogens. A later review reiterates this observation, noting that recent agents of concern -Ebola, Zika and chikungunya -had been identified decades before they achieved pandemic magnitude 62 . As a result of NGS technology, the pace of novel virus discovery is accelerating, with recent large-scale studies revealing 184 new viruses sampled from macaque faeces in a single geographic location 63 and 1,445 new viruses discovered from RNA transcriptomic analyses of multiple invertebrate species 64 .

Finally, the genomic evidence for epidemiological linkages is reviewed in the context of known epidemiological information, such as social contact between two cases or a common location or other exposure. Recently, automated methods for inferring potential epidemiological linkages from genomic data alone have been developed, greatly facilitating large-scale genomic epidemiological investigations 121 . and/or cross-species transmissions that may precede a human health event. For example, genome sequences from a raccoon-associated variant of rabies virus (RRV), when paired with fine-scale geographic information and data from Canadian and US wildlife rabies vaccination programmes, demonstrated that multiple cross-border incursions were responsible for the expansion of RRV into Canada and sustained outbreaks in several provinces 70 ; this finding led to renewed concern about and action against rabies on the part of public health authorities 71 . One of the first studies coupling detailed wildlife and livestock movement data with phylodynamic analysis of a bacterial pathogen revealed that crossspecies jumps from an elk reservoir were the source of increasing rates of Brucella abortus infections in nearby livestock 72 ; as the most common zoonosis of humans, brucellosis control programmes will benefit substantially from this sort of One Health approach 73 . This model, in which diagnostic testing in reference laboratories triggers genomic follow-up, represents an effective near-term solution for integrating genomics into One Health surveillance efforts as the community explores solutions to the many challenges facing in situ clinical metagenomics surveillance of animal populations (reviewed in REF. 74 ). Initial forays into this area have been successful; for example, metagenomics analysis of human diarrhoeal specimens and stools from nearby pigs revealed potential zoonotic transmission of rotavirus 75 . However, metagenomic sequencing across a range of animal species and environments yields more questions than answers. What is an early signal of patho gen emergence versus background microbial noise 65 ? Which emerging agents are capable of crossing the species barrier and causing human disease 74 ? What degree of sampling is required to capture potential spillovers 67 ? Ultimately, a more efficient use of metagenomics in a One Health surveillance strategy might be scanning for zoonotic 'jumps' in selected sentinel human populations rather than a sweeping animal surveillance strategy 62 , with sentinels chosen according to EID hotspot maps and other factors 65 and interesting genomic signals triggering follow-up sequencing in the relevant animal reser voirs. By combining genomic data generated through these targeted surveillance efforts with phylodynamic approaches, it will be possible to take simple presence or absence signals and derive useful epidemiological insights: signals of population expansion; evidence of transmission within and between animal reservoirs and humans; and epidemiological analysis of a pathogen's early expansion.",

During stage one (pre-emergence), as a result of changing demographics and/or land use, a pathogen undergoes a population expansion, extends its host range or moves into a new geographic region. During stage two (localized emergence), contact with animals or animal products results in spillover of the pathogen from its natural reservoir(s) into humans but with little to no onward person-to-person transmission. During stage three (pandemic emergence), the pathogen is able to sustain long transmission chains, that is, a series of disease transmission events, such as a sequential series of person-to-person transmissions, and its movement across borders is facilitated by human travel patterns 65 . epidemiology platforms are currently operating 88 , and their flexible nature and cost-effective, real-time reporting make them effective tools for gathering epidemic intelligence, particularly in settings lacking traditional disease surveillance systems.",

PREDICT also suggested a role for digital epidemiology in not just event detection but also the identification of changing EID drivers. EIDs are driven by multiple factors, many of which have digital outputs and represent novel sources of surveillance data 91 . For example, human movement can be revealed by mobile phone data or by the patterns of lighted cities at night, hunting data collected by states can reveal interactions between humans and wildlife, and social media and digital news sources can reveal early signals of famine, war and other social unrest. A major challenge is that the number of digital data sets available for each driver varies substantially, from hundreds for surveying land use changes -many based on remote sensing data 92 -to mere handfuls around social inequalities and human susceptibility to infection, with most data biased towards North America and Europe.",

Balancing the benefits and harms to both individuals and populations is challenging when the predictive insight offered by a genomic technology is variable -for example, using genomics to identify an individual as a 'super spreader' has important implications for quarantine and isolation, but that label may be predicated on a tenuous prediction. The problem is further compounded by the fact that many infectious disease diagnoses carry with them a certain amount of stigma and that an individual's right to privacy might be superseded by the need to protect the larger population 105 .",

Complicating the existence of a rapid, open, transparent response is the fact that no matter the setting, there are often conflicting interests at work. In an outbreak scenario, conflict may result from governments wishing to keep an outbreak quiet and/or from the tension between lower-income and middle-income countries with few resources for generating and using data and the researchers or response teams from better-resourced settings 115 . Indeed, the conflicting values in outbreak responses meet the definition of a 'wicked' problem, where issues resist simple resolution and span multiple jurisdictions and where each stakeholder has a different perspective on the solution. Even the International Health Regulations (IHR), which ostensibly provide a legal instrument for global health security, fail to effect a basic surveillance and outbreak response. As of the most recent self-reporting, only 30% of the 196 member countries of the IHR are in compliance, meeting the prescribed minimum public health core capacities 5 . In these settings, digital pathogen surveillance must be within the purview of the larger global health community and its diverse group of non-state actors rather than being solely the responsibility of nations themselves 116 . This raises an important issue: if nations are willing to cede a certain amount of surveillance and diag nostic control Box 1 | The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) framework for genomic data sharing",

            "text": "In the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 27 outlines the right of every individual \"to share in scientific advancement and its benefit\". In this spirit, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) data-sharing framework 119 , which covers data donors, producers and users, is guided by the principles of privacy, fairness and non-discrimination and has as its goal the promotion of health and well-being and the fair distribution of benefits arising from genomic research. The core elements of the framework include the following: \u2022 Transparency: knowing how the data will be handled, accessed and exchanged \u2022 Accountability: tracking of data access and mechanisms for addressing misuse \u2022 Engagement: involving citizens and facilitating dialogue and deliberation around the societal implications of data sharing \u2022 Quality and security: mitigating unauthorized access and implementing an unbiased approach to storing and processing data \u2022 Privacy, data protection and confidentiality: complying with the relevant regulations at every stage \u2022 Risk-benefit analysis: weighing benefits (including new knowledge, efficiencies and informed decision making) against risks (including invasion of privacy and breaches of confidentiality), minimizing harm and maximizing benefit at the individual and societal levels \u2022 Recognition and attribution: ensuring recognition is meaningful to participants, providing due credit to all who shared data and ensuring credit is given for both primary and secondary data use \u2022 Sustainability: implementing systems for archiving and retrieval \u2022 Education and training: advancing data sharing, improving data quality, educating people on why data sharing matters, and building capacity \u2022 Accessibility and dissemination: maximizing accessibility, promoting collaboration and using publication and digital dissemination to share results to the global health community, the notion of reciprocity suggests that they should derive some corresponding local benefit. The 'trickle-down' effects of global genomic surveillance have yet to be fully articulated, but they are likely to be realized first in the zoonotic domain, where global surveillance efforts will feed back into improved animal health at a local level, in turn benefiting local farmers. Outbreaks occur at the intersection of risk perception, governance, policy and economics 117 , and outbreak response is often based on political instinct rather than data 5 . Building a resilient and responsive public health system is therefore more than just enhancing surveillance and coupling it to novel technology -it is about engagement, trust, cooperation and building local capacity 8 , as well as a focus on pandemic prevention through development rather than pandemic response via disaster relief mechanisms 57 . Expert panels convened by Harvard and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine 9 and by the National Academy of Medicine 8 have called for a central pandemic preparedness and response agency and also underscored the need for deeper partnerships between formal and informal surveillance, epidemiology and academic and public health networks 5 . More recently, evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey wrote: \"Systematic pathogen surveillance is within our grasp, but is still undervalued and underfunded relative to the magnitude of the threat\" (REF. 118 ). If we are to achieve the sequencing singularity -the moment at which pathogen, environmental and digital data streams are integrated into a global surveillance system -we require a community united behind a vision in which public health and the attendant data belong to the public and behind the idea that we are a better, healthier society when the public is able to access and benefit from the data being collected about us and the pathogens we share the planet with.",
