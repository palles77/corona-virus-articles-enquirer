Our goal is to provide a prediction model to help policy makers in different countries address the epidemic outbreak and adjust the control policies to contain the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) more effectively.",

This method is an observation based projection similar than the classic Moore's Law in miroelectronics. The Moore's law is not based on any physics law and yet has anticipated the development of microelectronics for decades. This work is an empirical relation to decribe the evolution of epidemic to pandemic situations in different countries. The country was selected as an observation unit because the regulation and political decision is an national decision for numerous measures such as the implementation of social distancing, the quarantine of suspected cases, and the closing of borders to achieve territorial containment.",

For the moment, the Canada, USA, Australia may have difficulties to limit the fast evolution of the epidemic. With a Rc<0.5%, it's particularly important for the USA to consider escalating the control measures because the affected cases can reach more than one million very soon.",

However, reality could be a lot more complicated. For instance, COVID-19's incubation period varies from 1 to 14 days. What's more, to stop epidemic spread and reduce infections to lower levels is a concerted effort of both the government and the people. The strategies of dealing with the outbreak, the strength of government execution, how people react and respond to the measures are critical to the number of infections.",
