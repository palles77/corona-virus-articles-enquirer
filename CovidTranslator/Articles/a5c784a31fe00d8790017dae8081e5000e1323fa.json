The amplified pooled plasmid library was used to make infectious lentivirus from 293T cells. The day before transfection, 293T cells were seeded into twenty polylysine-coated 15 cm plates at a density of 6x10 6 cells per plate. The day of transfection, the culture media was exchanged for 15mL DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS, 1X NEAA, and Pen-Strep, and pooled library plasmid was then co-transfected with lentiviral packaging plasmids expressing Gag-Pol and VSV-g at a ratio of 5 at 55\u00b0C while shaking at 550rpm on a Thermomixer (Eppendorf). The following day, 5\u00b5l of 2 mg/ml RNase A was added to each tube and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h while shaking at 550rpm. Extractions were collected after mixing samples with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) twice, followed once by chloroform; each extraction was separated using MaXtract high density phase lock tubes (Qiagen). Twenty micrograms of glycoblue (Roche) and 1mL of 100% ethanol were added to each sample and DNA was precipitated at \u221220\u00b0C for 1h followed by centrifugation at 18,000g",
