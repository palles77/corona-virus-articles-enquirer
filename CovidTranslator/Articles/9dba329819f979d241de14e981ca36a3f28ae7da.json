Also, these infections may be more severe in immunocompromised patients than in the general population. Early diagnosis and treatment of viral infections continue to be of paramount importance in immunocompromised patients; because once viral replication and invasive infections are evident, prognosis can be grave. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the main antiviral agents used for the treatment of respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients and review of the new agents in the pipeline. Expert commentary: Over the past decade, important diagnostic advances, specifically, the use of rapid molecular testing has helped close the gap between clinical scenarios and pathogen identification and enhanced early diagnosis of viral infections and understanding of the role of prolonged shedding and viral loads. Advancements in novel antiviral therapeutics with high resistance thresholds and effective immunization for preventable infections in immunocompromised patients are needed.",

However, adverse outcomes are far more likely in immunocompromised patients than in nonimmunocompromised individuals and include progression to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and increased mortality rates (1) (2) (3) (4) . In fact, the LRTI rates and mortality rates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and patients with hematological malignancies reportedly range from 10% to 50% [2] [3] [4] [5] .

However, no clear evidence indicates that doubling the dose of oseltamivir is a more effective treatment than administering the normally prescribed dose in hospitalized patient, with or without severe illness [33, 34] . In a randomized trial of hospitalized patients with severe influenza, mortality rates were similar for patients who received oseltamivir at the double and standard doses [33] . However, 4 patients on the standard dose arm who were infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus without the H275Y substitution at baseline acquired this substitution while on treatment. Although no inferences can be made so far due to the small number of patients, using higher dose to prevent resistance and clinical failure in severely ill patients or immunocompromised patients still need to be determined in future studies [33] . In addition, a prospective study of adults hospitalized with influenza A and B infections treated with a single or double dose of oseltamivir twice daily demonstrated no differences between the groups in viral clearance, fever duration, oxygen supplementation, or hospitalization length [34] .",

Authors reported oseltamivir resistance, sometimes occurring within 1 week after treatment initiation, in immunocompromised patients with influenza A (H1N1) viral infections in the 2009 pandemic (pdm09) [35] . Genotypic and phenotypic antiviral susceptibility testing are currently available to check the presence of mutations conferring resistance [36] . The more common emergence of resistance to oseltamivir in immunocompromised patients probably partly owes to prolonged viral shedding despite the use of antiviral therapy [37] . Use of infection control measures is vital to reduce the risk of oseltamivir-resistant virus transmission in immunocompromised patients [32] . The pooled incidence rate of Oseltamivir resistance for seasonal influenza A(H1N1) infections was estimated to be about 2.6% by a systematic review in 2009 [38] . However, in Europe during the 2007-2008-winter season, rates of influenza A(H1N1) resistance were higher (up to 68%) [39] . Authors reported that a specific substitution of the seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus strains H275Y (histidine-to-tyrosine substitution in neuraminidase), caused resistance in most of these cases [10, 11] . Most circulating influenza A (H3N2) and influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 are still susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Of the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infections tested during the 2013-2014 influenza season, 98.2% were susceptible to oseltamivir, and 100% were susceptible to zanamivir [40] .",

Considering that DAS181 targets the host cells rather than the virus, it is less likely than virus-targeted drugs to induce treatment resistance. DAS 181 is administered via inhalation and has exhibited preclinical activity against numerous strains of influenza (A and B) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) [65, 66] . In a phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing influenza viral load and patient safety in otherwise healthy influenza-infected participants, an inhaled DAS181 dosage of 20 mg per day reduced viral loads and viral shedding in the multiple-dose group more than in patients taking a placebo as measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (P < 0.05); however, there was no difference in alleviation of flu-like symptoms between the placebo and the treatment arms.

A phase III randomized controlled trial demonstrated the superiority of a single inhalation dose of laninamivir octanoate to a 5-day course of oral oseltamivir in adults with seasonal influenza [71] . The drug is potentially effective against oseltamivir-resistant viruses and is currently available in Japan. Laninamivir has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing transmission of influenza infection from patients to household contacts. In a randomized trial, household contact of patient with influenza infection were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of laninamivir, 2 doses of laninamivir given daily for 2 days, or a placebo. Family members in the laninamivir groups were less likely to develop clinical influenza as compared to the placebo group [72] . Daiichi Sankyo Company, Ltd. in Japan plans to study the drug for the prevention of influenza, in single inhalation dose, in both adult and children [73] .",

The authors reported a statistically significant trend of higher incidence of LRTI-and RSV infection-associated mortality as the risk increased from low to moderate to high (P < 0.001). Patients in the high-risk group demonstrated greatest benefit of ribavirin-based therapy at the URTI stage and were at the highest risk for progression to LRTI and death in the absence of antiviral therapy. We suggest using the immunodeficiency scoring index for RSV to identify high-risk patients who would benefit from treatment with aerosolized ribavirin.",

RSV infections markedly increase morbidity and mortality rates in HSCT recipients. Ribavirin-based antiviral therapy is recommended by European guidelines for leukemia patients and HSCT recipients at high risk of complications [16, 91] . In a systematic review of the literature by Shah et al. [92] and based mainly on retrospective studies, any form of ribavirinbased therapy (alone or in combination with immunomodulators) prevented URTIs from progressing to LRTIs (from 45% to 16%) and improved mortality rates (from 70% to 35%) when compared to no therapy in adult HSCT recipients [92] . Whether the benefits of aerosolized ribavirin versus the oral form justify its use in immunocompromised patients remain subject of controversy, especially given the recent drastic increase in the cost of the aerosolized form [93] .",

In 2004, Khanna et al.

The doses recommended in the European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL-4) guidelines included a loading dose of 600 mg followed by 200 mg every 8 h the first day, 400 mg every 8 h the second day, and then escalation daily to a maximum of 30 mg/kg/day [16] .

RNA interference is a natural process and siRNAs induce sequence-specific degradation of mRNA and thus reduce expression of the corresponding protein [106] .

In a phase IIa randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adult lung transplant recipients with confirmed RSV URTIs, use of aerosolized ALN-RSV01 (0.6 mg/kg) daily for 3 days significantly reduced mean cumulative daily symptom scores (P = 0.035) and the incidence of progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome by day 90 more so than in patients given a placebo (6% vs. 50 %; P = 0.027) [107] .

In a case series, 4 pediatric HSCT recipients with PIV detected in respiratory specimens (2 from the upper respiratory tract and 2 from the lower respiratory tract) received inhaled DAS181 for 5-10 days. Oxygen requirements and respiratory rates improved in all 4 patients, and their viral loads decreased within 1 week after therapy initiation [127] . In a similar case series, 16 HSCT recipients received DAS181 daily to treat PIV infections (14 LRTIs and 2 URTIs). Of the 16 patient, 9 had complete clinical response, and 4 patients had a partial response to DAS181 therapy. Of 7 patients with virological and spirometric data, 5 had reduction in PIV viral load in nasopharyngeal secretions and 4 had improved forced expiratory volumes by the end of treatment [128] . In an ongoing phase II double-blind, placebocontrolled trial, investigators are examining the effects of DAS181 in immunocompromised patients with PIV-related pneumonia [129] .

Phylogenetic analysis has identified two genotypes of HMPV: HMPV A and HMPV B [151] . HMPV uses a fusion mechanism to penetrate target cells. The fusion process consists of insertion of the hydrophobic fusion peptide into the target cell membrane and refolding of the F protein.

High clinical suspicion and the use of rapid diagnostic tests remain crucial, as early treatment is associated with improved outcomes and reduced transmission. Several advances in the prevention and treatments of influenza infection have occurred in recent decades. Inadequate efficacy of the influenza vaccine as well as the emergence of antiviral resistance, which appears to occur more commonly in immunocompromised patients than in healthy host, underline the difficulties in management of respiratory infections in immunocompromised individuals. RSV and PIV infections continue to be associated with high morbidity and mortality, and further advancements in prevention of and therapy for respiratory viral infections are needed. The impact of rhinovirus, coronavirus, and metapneumovirus infection in patients with compromised immune systems is becoming evident as new, widely available molecular testing improves the recognition of these viral infections.",

Respiratory viral infections can be complicated for both clinicians and immunocompromised patients. Future studies that identify and validate scoring systems to ascertaining patients at highest risk for complications of respiratory viral infections including LRTI, are of utmost importance. Also, identification of long-term complications after respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients and devising interventions for prevention will be of the utmost value. Last, advancement in novel antiviral therapeutics with high-resistance thresholds and effective immunization for preventable infections in immunocompromised patients are needed.",

Multiple interventional modalities should be studied from stimulation of the innate immune system, response to immunizations, to new antiviral therapies, to avert infection and progression to lower tract respiratory infections. One of the main challenges for immunocompromised patients is the ability to clear infections with subsequent complications associated with worsening infections, prolonged shedding, risk of resistance and coinfections. Treatment targeting not only viral replication, but also the immune response to these infections may offer better outcomes. Last, understanding the role of the microbiome and virome, and its implications on transmission as well as development of infection will be key for development of new strategies.",
