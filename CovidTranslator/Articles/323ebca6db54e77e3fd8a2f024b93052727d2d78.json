The introduction of a specific prion-binding ligand gel in combination with SD treatment, time-reduced from 4 to 1-1.5 h, still ensures efficient virus kill, reduces abnormal prion protein by >5 log steps, and preserves levels of plasmin inhibitor at close to the reference range. Infections with known nonenveloped viruses such as HAV or parvovirus B19 are prevented by ensuring low virus loads in the starting plasma units, dilution through pooling of single plasma units, and neutralization of immune antibodies already present in the initial plasma pools. The major advantages of SD plasma over fresh frozen plasma and the other pathogen-inactivated plasmas are its extreme safety with respect to transfusion-related acute lung injury and the significantly lower likelihood of provoking allergic reactions. Both advantages are best interpreted as results of the dilution effect of pooling. No fewer than 18 clinical studies covering all indications for plasma, and extensive clinical experience have shown that reduced levels of coagulation factors and inhibitors as a result of SD treatment do not impair significantly the clinical efficacy or tolerance of plasma. Properly standardized clotting factor and inhibitor potencies and low batch-to-batch variations when compared with single-donor plasma units makes SD plasma more suitable for standardized treatment.",

Because the effect of plasma in transfusion medicine depends heavily on proteins that seemed resistant to SD treatment, Bernhard Horowitz proposed in 1986/1987 the development of a method to treat plasma with SD. Unable to arouse interest or find financing in the USA, he turned to Octapharma (Octapharma AG, Lachen, Switzerland), that agreed to finance the laboratory effort at the New York Blood Center (NYBC) in exchange for European marketing rights. Laboratory work was complete by 1989, 1 year after its initiation, and the experimental process was handed off to Octapharma [3] . Working with the German Red Cross Center in Hagen, Germany, Octapharma matured the laboratory process to a form suitable for industrial-scale manufacturing. Characterization of the manufactured product was published in 1992 [4] , at which time also Horowitz and his collaborators published their results [5] . Biesert and Shartono [6] subsequently validated the robustness of SD plasma treatment in their study of the virus safety of Octaplas \u00ae (Octapharma AG, Lachen, Switzerland).",

Sodium cholate, the usual detergent used in the SD treatment of coagulation factors, was substituted by 1% polyoxyethylene-p-t-octylphenol (Triton X-100), because it can easily be removed together with TNBP by a simple and effective hydrophobic chromatographic step [7] . TNBP acts as an organic solvent to remove lipids from the membranes of pathogens and is used alone in some protocols. Triton X-100 is a non-ionic detergent that stabilizes TNBP and disrupts lipid bilayers, thus easing the extraction of lipids [8] . In some processes, a final step involves adding soybean or castor oil to the SD treatment has no effect on non-enveloped viruses, but immune antibodies commonly present in plasma provide a measure of protection against infection by the most commonly encountered non-enveloped viruses such as HAV and parvovirus B19 [3, 19, 20] .

So far, all of the tested enveloped viruses, including recently emerging viruses such as West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, new influenza strains and severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus, are vulnerable to the SD process. Between 1991 and 2009, Octapharma, from its factory in Austria together with licensees in Germany (Red Cross Center, Hagen), France (CRTS, Bordeaux ), Italy (Kedrion) and South Africa (NBI, Pinetown), delivered approximately 10 million units of SD plasma for use in routine medical care. The efficacy of the SD treatment process is underscored by the fact that no documented case of infection with HBV, HCV or HIV as a result of transfusion with SD plasma has been reported. It follows that the original 4-hour incubation time provides an excessive margin of safety, permitting a reduction of incubation time to 1-1.5 h for Octa-plasLG, which has a safety margin still superior to most other pathogen-reducing technologies. (Octaplas) and its licensees is produced from optimally separated and frozen plasma, and with a 10-20% reduction of clotting factor and inhibitor activities has a final composition similar to FFP. Factor VIII activity is about 20% lower than in FFP. Protein S activity is reduced by 35%, and plasmin inhibitor activity levels in 200-380 l pools are only 24-33% of normal. In the French SD plasma produced from 60 l pools, the plasmin inhibitor level is 37-42% of normal. In 'mini-pool' SD plasma, protein S and plasmin inhibitor are reduced by only 10-20% of normal. PLAS+SD, with pool sizes of up to 650 l and less strict quality requirements for the separation and freezing of plasma, had strikingly lower activities of protein S, plasmin inhibitor, plasmin activator inhibitor and antitrypsin than Octaplas [27] [28] [29] . In the new OctaplasLG, where SD treatment is reduced to 1-1.5 h, the activity of plasmin inhibitor is increased to about 66% of normal. Thus, incubation time, stress due to pool size and plasma quality all appear to affect plasmin inhibitor. Burnouf et al. [30] has also speculated that Triton X-100 might affect plasmin inhibitor, but, if so, this can be avoided by using the smaller compound Triton X-45. Bleeding problems in liver transplantation with Octaplas produced for Ireland from American plasma may have been due to negative effects caused by delay of freezing, beginning the day after collection [31] .",

In most other European countries it was treated as a medicinal product, and the use of SD plasma was often permitted during the registration process because of its obvious virus safety, particularly with regard to HCV. SD plasma was first introduced in 1991 in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. In Norway, SD plasma replaced FFP in 1993 following a successful clinical trial in 1992 [32] . Currently, ordinary medicinal licensing is required for SD plasma in European countries except France, where it is classed as a labeled blood product. Octaplas is now a licensed biopharmaceutical product in 29 countries worldwide. So far, Octa-plasLG has been approved for use in Germany and Australia, and regulatory procedures are ongoing in other European countries. Confirmatory studies on the claimed capacity to remove prions that were requested by some countries are nearing completion. The approval process for Uniplas is also in its final stages (T.E. Svae, Octapharma, personal communication). In the USA, regulatory approval was long delayed compared to Europe. The FDA's attitude toward SD plasma began to change in 1990-1991. As clinical data accumulated, it became clear that US approval for SD plasma was justified, but the requirement to have sufficient production capacity (2,000,000 units/year) and a nation-level distribution partner delayed FDA approval until 1998. By then VITEX had increased its production capacity for SD plasma sufficiently, and the American Red Cross (ARC) was selected as sole distributor. Heated debate ensued, ranging from questions of medical or scientific concern to rising health care costs and the poten-",

As a pooled and uniform product with a unit volume of 200 ml, SD plasma has low batchto-batch variations in plasma levels of coagulation factors, inhibitors and antibodies, allowing clinicians to predict the plasma transfusion effects more precisely. SD plasma by Octapharma Octaplas since 2005 demonstrate that all patient groups, including preterm infants and liver transplant patients, can be transfused with SD plasma [11, 38, 39] and that special products such as reconstituted blood can be prepared using SD plasma. Similar experience, except bleeding problems in liver transplantation, have been reported from Ireland where approximately 200,000 units of Octaplas have been transfused after 2002. These bleeding problems could be ascribed to the recovered American plasma used in the production of Octaplas batches for Ireland [31] . So far, more than 700 liver transplants have been performed with good results at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, with SD plasma as the only plasma component. No cases of thromboembolism have been ascribed to its use. Due to the low content of plasmin inhibitor in Octaplas, aprotinin was initially used frequently in severe liver failure, thus complicating repeat cardiac surgery [40] . Now aprotinin has been successfully substituted with tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery and liver transplantation except in some very few liver transplant patients requiring a broad spectrum serine protease inhibitors [38] . Portugal has also good experience with Octaplas since its introduction in 1995, however, to our knowledge without scientific documentation so far. Hemovigilance data from France, Norway and Finland show significant reductions (approximately 85%) in serious adverse events. With respect to TRALI no documented events have ever been reported for SD plasma. In the UK more than 350,000 units of Octaplas have been transfused after introduction of the Serious Hazards of Transfusion Hemovigilance system without reports on serious problems. After switching to 100% SD plasma the annual rate of clinical use has shown very little change in Ireland and Finland [31, 39] while Norway has experienced an increase of about 70% to 2,026 l per million inhabitants since 1993 [38] . This is still below the mean consumption of 2,386 l per million inhabitants in Western Europe or 4,153 l per million in Germany (C.L. van der Poel, Sanquin, The Netherlands, personal communication). The fact that SD plasma is a clear, standardized solution with a defined constant volume and few adverse events has made it particularly popular among anesthesiologists and surgeons. A comparison of the properties of different types of therapeutic plasma is presented in table 2. tial impact on blood center and blood bank revenues and product control. Introduction of PLAS+SD with the ARC logo and the fact that ARC was an exclusive US distributor provoked strong reactions from members of America's Blood Centers, who collect and distribute half of the nation's blood supply. Additionally, the ARC set the price for PLAS+SD 30% higher than expected. This, along with a number of thromboembolic adverse reactions that had not been observed with European SD plasma resulted in the termination of SD plasma production in the USA in 2002-2003 [3] .",

Though all of these studies lacked statistical power to detect minor differences due to their small size, they clearly show that the loss of coagulation factor and inhibitor levels caused by SD treatment does not result in any significant loss of clinical efficacy or tolerance. Concerns about the low levels of plasmin inhibitor, protein S, or antitrypsin activity in SD plasma have not been confirmed in clinical studies, and claims of thrombosis or hyperfibrinolytic bleeding triggered by reduced protein S or low plasmin inhibitor potencies in Octaplas have not withstood critical review [26, 36, 37] . That notwithstanding, the higher level of plasmin inhibitor of OctaplasLG, which approaches the lower normal reference range, is welcome.",
