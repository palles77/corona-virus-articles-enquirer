We investigated the inhibitory effect of phosphorodiamidiate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) targeted against norovirus sequences. A panel of peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMOs) specific for the murine norovirus (MNV) genome was developed, and two PPMO compounds directed against the first AUG of the ORF1 coding sequence near the 5\u2032-end of the genome proved effective in inhibiting MNV replication in cells. A consensus PPMO (designated Noro 1.1), designed to target the corresponding region of several diverse human norovirus genotypes, decreased the efficiency of protein translation in a cell-free luciferase reporter assay and inhibited Norwalk virus protein expression in replicon-bearing cells. Our data suggest that PPMOs directed against the relatively conserved 5\u2032-end of the norovirus genome may show broad antiviral activity against this genetically diverse group of viruses.",

Noroviruses belong to the family Caliciviridae, which consists of four genera: Norovirus, Sapovirus, Vesivirus and Lagovirus. These 27-35 nm, non-enveloped viruses have single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes. Norovirus genomes are organized into three open reading frames (ORFs). The 5\u2032 terminal ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein that is processed into mature nonstructural proteins (Green, 2007) . ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein, VP1, and the 3\u2032 terminal ORF3 encodes a minor structural protein, VP2.",

Noroviruses have highly variable genomes (up to 43% nucleotide divergence between genogroups), with over 100 distinct viruses identified to date. The 5\u2032-end sequence of the virus is one of the most conserved regions among norovirus genomes. Like other caliciviruses, the 5\u2032-end of the norovirus genome shares sequence similarity with the 5\u2032-end of the viral subgenomic RNA that maps near the beginning of ORF2 (Green, 2007) .",

Norovirus VLPs have served as antigens for the study of norovirus immunity, and as a vaccine candidate (Estes et al., 2000) . An alternative approach to the study of norovirus RNA replication was established when a human norovirus replicon-bearing cell line was created by transfecting a plasmid containing most of the Norwalk virus genome into mammalian cell lines . These cell lines are capable of constitutively expressing the replicative enzymes and other nonstructural proteins, allowing the study of RNA replication and providing a platform for screening antiviral compounds.",

MNV shares molecular properties with other noroviruses , although various MNV strains are less divergent in their genome sequence and therefore comprise a single genotype . Analysis of MNV genomes identified the three open reading frames characteristic of noroviruses and vesiviruses ( Fig. 1) , and an additional ORF4 that overlaps ORF2 in a different reading frame . ORF1 of MNV also encodes the nonstructural proteins while ORFs 2 and 3 encode the two proteins present in the viral capsid . MNV-1 replication and dissemination in wild-type mice are limited by STAT-1 dependent interferons (Mumphrey et al., 2007) . Thus, virus replication in lymph nodes and intestinal tissue in vivo does not result in clinical disease in mice. In vitro, MNV-1 grows efficiently in dendritic cells and macrophages (Chaudhry et al., 2007; Ward et al., 2007; Wobus et al., 2004) , facilitating studies of viral gene expression, replication, cytopathology, and antiviral effector molecules. In addition, MNV is the only norovirus for which a reverse genetic system has been developed (Chaudhry et al., 2007; Ward et al., 2007) .",

PMOs are uncharged, water-soluble, and highly resistant to degradation in the host. PMOs bind to mRNA by the Watson-Crick base-pairing, and can reduce gene expression by the steric blockade of mRNA (Ghosh et al., 2000; Stein et al., 1997; Summerton, 1999) . To improve uptake into cells, PMO can be conjugated to an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide to produce peptide-PMO (PPMO) (Abes et al., 2006; Deas et al., 2007; Moulton et al., 2004) .",

The titers of feline calicivirus (FCV), a vesivirus, were significantly reduced in cell culture by treatment with PMOs targeted to the upstream region of ORF1 (Stein et al., 2001) . Furthermore, this PMO was reported to be effective in treating FCV disease in kittens (Smith et al., 2008) . Because the corresponding 5\u2032-end sequence is relatively conserved within the noroviruses, we hypothesized that this region might also function as a target for inhibition of norovirus replication. We designed a panel of PPMOs directed against selected regions of the murine norovirus genome and in addition, developed a PPMO targeted to a 5\u2032-end consensus sequence representing several circulating human norovirus genotypes. We used recently available assays to test the ability of the PPMOs to inhibit viral protein synthesis and replication in their corresponding homologous systems. Our study identified a target site near the 5\u2032-end of the norovirus genome that may prove useful for the inhibition of viral translation and replication by specific PPMOs. The application of PMOs to basic studies of norovirus replication in vitro and in animal models might lead to the evaluation of this class of chemical compounds as antiviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of norovirus disease in humans.",

Although two structural differences, the addition of an FITC label and the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group, prevent a direct comparison with the test PPMOs, these results demonstrate an efficient and dose-responsive uptake of peptideconjugated PMOs into RAW264.7 macrophages. We subsequently identified the maximal nontoxic dose of each MNV-1 PPMO in cytotoxicity assays. All the PPMOs designed for this study (Table 1 and Fig. 1) were nontoxic up to a concentration of 20 \u03bcM (Fig. 2) . Higher concentrations of most PPMOs induced cytotoxicity, with the exception of PPMOs A and C, which remained nontoxic even at concentrations of 80 \u03bcM.",

The 5\u2032-end sequences of the CN2753 and CN3050 viruses, as well as those from representative prototype noroviruses indicated in Table 2 , were engineered as part of a 40 nt leader sequence into a luciferase reporter plasmid, designated pCiNeo-Luc (Fig. 6A ). In addition to the naturally occurring 5\u2032-end sequences, we also designed three constructs (designated laboratory variants 1-3) that incorporated varying combinations of the nucleotides that showed evidence for variation among circulating norovirus strains, in order to test the specificity of the PPMO. The 5\u2032-end of the Jena GIII bovine norovirus was also included in the analysis. We examined whether the PPMO Noro 1.1 showed an inhibitory effect on translation of the luciferase protein under control of each of the 5\u2032-end leader sequences (Fig. 6B ). The Noro 1.1 compound was added in a range of concentrations (0.01 to 83 \u03bcM) to the translation reaction, and the percent inhibition was calculated by comparing the luciferase expression in each reaction with a nontreated control. Fig. 7 shows the percent inhibition as measured by luciferase expression levels in this cell-free system. PPMO Noro 1.1 at a con- centration of 3 \u03bcM inhibited at least 80% of the luciferase expression from a reporter RNA containing an identical complementary target sequence and in addition, inhibited all other human norovirus ORF1 constructs. The bovine norovirus target never achieved more than 57% inhibition by Noro 1.1 in the range of concentrations tested. Of interest, Noro 1.1 inhibited translation of two artificial laboratory variant targets, LabVar 1 and 2, with 4 and 5 nucleotide changes, respectively, although less efficiently. The 5\u2032-end of the GIII bovine norovirus genome (which contains 6 nucleotide changes from the precise Noro 1.1 target sequence), was the only naturally occurring viral target for which the PPMO failed to inhibit at least 80% of the luciferase translation, even with concentrations greater than 80 \u03bcM. Finally, Noro 1.1 completely failed to inhibit translation of the third laboratory variant, which contained 6 nucleotide differences (LabVar3, data not shown).",

Approximately 50% of the HG23 cells expressed Norfolk viral proteins (as observed by immunofluorescence detecting the viral capsid protein). This fact, together with the finding that peptide-conjugated PMOs are not efficiently taken up by the HG23 cells, led us to choose electroporation as an efficient means to deliver Noro 1.1 to a majority of these cells. We tested the proportion of cells incorporating an FITC-labeled Noro 1.1 PMO following electroporation in order to examine the efficiency of the transfection method (Fig. 8F) . The majority of cells in the monolayer showed a positive immunofluorescence signal compared to the cells receiving the FITC-Noro 1.1 PMO without electroporation (Fig. 8E) . Because the replicon cell line was constitutively expressing viral proteins, pre-treatment with PMO was not feasible. For this reason, the highest nontoxic concentration (16 \u03bcM) was selected for further experiments. Noro 1.1 PPMO (16 \u03bcM) was introduced into cells by electroporation, and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days. An immunofluorescence assay was then performed with antisera specific for Norwalk virus proteins VP1 and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to examine viral protein synthesis. The level of VP1 expression was visibly reduced in the presence of PMO, compared to nontreated control cells (Figs. 8B and D) . The expression of the norovirus RdRP protein was also visibly reduced in PMO-treated replicon cells when compared to nontreated cells (Figs. 8A and B) . These results are consistent with reduced translation of the viral proteins by Noro 1.1.",

The presence of norovirusspecific serum antibodies does not correlate with resistance to subsequent norovirus infection and illness (Lindesmith et al., 2003; Parrino et al., 1977) , complicating the impetus toward the development of an efficacious vaccine. Thus, novel approaches to controlling the infection are needed. However, in their design, consideration must be given to the fact these viruses are also genetically diverse, with multiple genotypes of noroviruses co-circulating worldwide. In 2006, Zheng et al. proposed a genomic norovirus classification system and a strain nomenclature that divide noroviruses into genogroups I to V, with each genogroup further divided into genetic clusters (or genotypes) (Zheng et al., 2006) . The uncorrected pairwise distances between genogroups are unusually large among RNA viruses, ranging from 43% to 58%. Genogroups are then further subdivided into 8 and 17 clusters for NoVGI and NoVGII respectively (Zheng et al., 2006) . This scenario makes the selection of an appropriate vaccine candidate, protective correlates aside, even more challenging.",

            "text": "A murine norovirus was recently described, providing the first isolate in the genus that can be propagated in cell culture (Wobus et al., 2004) . This model offers an opportunity to assess PMO activity in vivo, with a well-characterized host species. The results observed with mouse norovirus PPMOs tested in cell culture showed that two PPMOs targeting the MNV-1 5\u2032 AUG translational start site of ORF1 inhibited MNV-1 replication. These data are consistent with previous PMO studies that proposed translation inhibition as a major mechanism of action (Ghosh et al., 2000; Stein et al., 1997; Summerton, 1999) . The failure to translate the nonstructural proteins encoded in ORF1 of the MNV genome would result in the inability of the virus to replicate its RNA genome. However, it is not yet understood why certain specific PPMOs do not inhibit the virus growth (e.g. PPMOs directed against ORF2), and we hypothesize that additional mechanisms might be involved in the reduction of MNV infectivity beyond the inhibition of translation. The PPMOs directed against the 5\u2032-end of the virus might be alternatively interfering with the RNA secondary structure that has been proposed to be essential for viral RNA replication (Simmonds et al., 2008) . The disruption of this specific structure by mutagenesis of the MNV genome has been reported to decrease virus titers by 15 to 20 fold (Simmonds et al., 2008) . The observation that PPMO A was less effective on virus replication than PPMOs B and C was unexpected. Its sequence completely overlaps that of PPMO B, with two additional 5\u2032 guanine nucleotides and its length is intermediate (22 nt) between PPMO B (20 nt) and PPMO C (25 nt). Comparative studies of the mechanism of action of the PPMOs in this study could provide additional insight into the design of an optimal antisense drug.",

Noro 1.1 PPMO treatment was associated with in vitro inhibition of translation (\u2265 80% inhibition with \u2264 3 \u03bcM PMO) of all norovirus targets with up to 3 nucleotide mismatches. Therefore, based on the variability of naturally circulating 5\u2032-end norovirus sequences found in this study and additional sequences submitted to GenBank since the design of this compound (which only show 3 mismatches or less compared to Noro 1.1, Table 3 ), Noro 1.1 has the potential to inhibit translation of every human norovirus genotype described so far. However, Noro 1.1 would likely not inhibit certain animal noroviruses such as MNV-1 (12 mismatches) and bovine norovirus (6 mismatches). Noro 1.1 was a successful inhibitor of translation of the two GII.4 variants tested, achieving 100% inhibition in both cases. This is an important property of Noro 1.1 since GII.4 is the most commonly detected norovirus genotype worldwide (Bull et al., 2006; Kirkwood, 2004) . These results suggest that the efficacy of a single PPMO compound targeted to the conserved 5\u2032-end may not be affected by the marked genetic variability of circulating noroviruses in other regions of the genome.",

Only 3 \u03bcM of Noro 1.1 was needed to inhibit 80% or more of the total protein translation of representative circulating norovirus variants, as measured in a luciferase reporter assay system. Greater concentrations were needed to achieve similar inhibition rates only when testing artificially diverse \"laboratory variants\" or bovine norovirus. In (0 any case, the PPMO IC50 value was usually between 150 and 300 nM, comparable to previously reported values (Patel et al., 2008) . In addition, the murine norovirus PPMO experiments showed that 20 \u03bcM of compound, a concentration similar to that previously reported in PMO studies, is capable of inhibiting the replication of a wide range of virus titers, showing an antisense effect even when 2 \u00d7 10 5 PFU of MNV were in the presence of an anti 5\u2032-end PPMO (PPMO C) (Burrer et al., 2007; Ge et al., 2006; Patel et al., 2008) . The inhibition of protein translation by Noro 1.1 was further confirmed in the experiments carried out in cell culture. Noro 1.1 effectively inhibited norovirus protein translation in HG23 cells as evidenced by immunofluorescence. This effect was observed even after a 5-day incubation period with Noro 1.1 at a concentration of 16 \u03bcM demonstrating the stability of the compound when incubated at 37\u00b0C for long periods of time. This stability could potentially reduce the number of doses needed for successful treatment. The HG23 clone expressing the Norwalk virus replicon constitutively expresses Norwalk virus RNA and proteins in all cells. It has been used as a screen for antiviral agents, such as interferon alpha (Chang and George, 2007) . However, treatment of HG23 with as high as 20 units of interferon alpha, a concentration ten times the ED 50 , significantly reduced levels of polymerase protein, yet approximately 100 copies of RNA genome per cell were retained. With this antiviral agent, reductions in viral polymerase levels did not directly correlate with a reduction in viral RNA. We, too, found a significant reduction in Norwalk proteins after treatment of HG23 with Noro 1.1, yet did not see a significant reduction in RNA with this dose of PMO (data not shown). Likely, viral polymerase at levels below the limit of detection of IF remained, and as seen with IFNa, a reduction in viral RNA may require higher concentrations of the compound. How this observation relates to a natural infection awaits cell culture methods for propagating human noroviruses. Indirect evidence that MNV-1 PPMOs B and C effectively inhibited viral genome replication in the context of virus infection was demonstrated by the fact that infection of control-treated RAW264.7 cells with an m.o.i. as low as 0.0001 (20 PFU/2 \u00d7 10 5 cells) produced 100% CPE within 3 days, while PPMO B or C treatment significantly inhibited CPE resulting from 1000 times this dose (m.o.i. of 0.1) during this time.",

            "text": "A recent study using PPMOs to inhibit the replication of feline calicivirus (FCV), a norovirus-related virus, showed that the antiviral effect previously observed in vitro could be translated into a clinical application. The antiviral strategy used was similar, testing a FCV-PMO that masked the first AUG of the virus genome. This compound was initially shown to reduce FCV viral titers, in a dose-dependent manner, by 70% when 20 \u03bcM of the PMO was present in cell culture, which is comparable to that used in our in vitro experiments. The FCV-PMO was then tested in vivo, administered subcutaneously to kittens during an outbreak of FCV disease, and 80% of treated kittens (47/59) survived severe FCV infection, compared with 10% of non-treated kittens (3/31) (Smith et al., 2008) . The dosage used to achieve these results in vivo was estimated to be approximately 1 \u03bcM (2 mg/kg). This study implicates that the current PPMO doses used with murine and human noroviruses \"in vitro\" might be translated into a successful clinical application. The use of such an antiviral compound could represent a huge advantage to prevent and control gastroenteritis outbreaks. While the duration of the clinical symptoms caused by norovirus is usually short and self-limited, shedding of the virus in stool commonly lasts for up to a month, which greatly increases the possibility of transmission of the disease (Green, 2007) . Thus, the administration of an antiviral to sick patients and their contacts might prevent the spread of the disease, especially in sensitive settings such as hospital wards, military ships, and nursing homes where it might also prevent death of elderly patients.",

Briefly, each reporter plasmid was engineered to include a 5\u2032-end sequence of interest (summarized in Table 2 ) as a translational \"leader\" sequence (approximately 40 nt in length) fused in frame immediately upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in which the first A of the AUG codon was removed. The leader sequences were synthesized as oligonucleotides with engineered restriction enzyme sites at the 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-ends to facilitate cloning into the NheI and SalI sites of the expression plasmid, pCiNeo (Promega, Madison, WI). The expression cassette in the vector was organized as follows: CMV promoter-intervening intron-T7 promoter-leader sequence-luciferase gene-poly-A signal (Fig. 6A) . Each construct was verified by sequence analysis. The resulting plasmid DNA was digested with a restriction enzyme (NotI), purified, and RNA was transcribed from the plasmid with T7 polymerase (Megascript, Ambion, Austin, TX). The transcribed RNA was purified and run in an agarose gel to verify quality and size. In addition, the RNA was quantitated by UV spectroscopy and 6 nM solutions were prepared for use in translation assays. The translation reaction was carried out in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). To assess the effect of the Noro 1.1 PPMO on translation, a reaction included the following: 3 \u03bcl PPMO (final concentration 0.01-83 \u03bcM), 3 \u03bcl RNA (final concentration 1 nM), 1 \u03bcl amino acid mix, and 11 \u03bcl nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate. This reaction was incubated for 75 min at 37\u00b0C and terminated by chilling on ice. Ten microliters of this reaction was then added to 50 \u03bcl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI), mixed gently 5 times and incubated for 30 s at room temperature, after which light emission was measured (Dynex MLX luminometer, Dynex, Chantilly, VA). Controls for this experiment included (i) a nonspecific PMO directed against ORF3 of vesiviruses (Stein et al., 2001) , (ii) nontreated (no PMO), and (iii) a specimen without RNA. The Noro 1.1 PPMO was assayed within a range of concentrations that were effective and nontoxic in previous cell culture studies. Each assay was performed at least twice and constructs were analyzed by two independent investigators in two separate laboratories to verify reproducibility. Percent inhibition was determined by comparing the reduction in the firefly luciferase signal of different concentrations of a specific PPMO with the signal obtained without PPMO in the well.",

In order to determine the best electroporation conditions for the HG23 cell line, an optimization kit was utilized to test several electroporation solutions combined with different nucleofection programs (Nucleofector, Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD). Electroporation solution \"L\" combined with the nucleofection program \"A020\" was selected as the best compromise between cell viability and PMO incorporation. A range of concentrations of FITC-Noro 1.1 (1 to 16 \u03bcM) was electroporated (Nucleofector, Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) into the replicon cell line, and cell monolayers were observed 24 h later for fluorescence to determine the toxicity and optimal concentration of PMO. Based on this experiment, 16 \u03bcM (maximum concentration and nontoxic) of the Noro 1.1 PMO was electroporated into 2 \u00d7 10 6 replicon-bearing cells, which were then seeded into 100 mm cell culture plates.
