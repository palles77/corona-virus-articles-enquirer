Methods: Upper and lower respiratory tract secretion samples from putative patients with COVID-19 were inoculated onto cells to isolate the virus. Full genome sequencing and electron microscopy were used to identify the virus. Results: The virus replicated in Vero cells and cytopathic effects were observed. Full genome sequencing showed that the virus genome exhibited sequence homology of more than 99.9% with SARS-CoV-2 which was isolated from patients from other countries, for instance China. Sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was 77.5% and 50%, respectively. Coronavirus-specific morphology was observed by electron microscopy in virus-infected Vero cells. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from putative patients with unexplained pneumonia and intermittent coughing and fever. The isolated virus was named BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020.",

Discussion As of February 12 th , 2020, 28 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Korea, with the first case observed in a traveler residing in Wuhan, China. The SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a Korean patient who had self-administered antipyretics for initial symptoms such as chills and fever. The patient had experienced intermittent coughing with sputum 3 days after the administration of antipyretics. The SARS-CoV-2 could replicate in other cells (Vero E6 and Caco-II cells), in addition to Vero cells (data not shown). The first SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated by inoculating human airway epithelial cells with bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid samples from a patient with pneumonia [16].

However, the lowest homology of 99.5% was observed with BetaCoV/Wuwhan/IVDCHB-04/2020, which could be because of the inaccurate sequence of IVDCHB-04, Hence, it has been excluded from the comparative analysis in other studies. Prior to identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent of the unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China, pan-CoV RT-PCR was being used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in Korea. The Pan-CoV RT-PCR detects all human coronaviruses and animal-derived coronaviruses (personal communication). Since the release of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, a real-time RT-PCR method has been established in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on gene detection via real-time RT-PCR. With the isolation of the causative agent, development of serological tests and rapid diagnostic tests in addition to virus detection will be required.",
