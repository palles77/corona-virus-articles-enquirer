The live virus strains including wild and Sabin strains must be handled in level 3 biocontainment laboratories. To develop an alternative assay without the use of a live virus, we constructed Mahoney, MEF-1, and Saukett pseudovirions by inserting luciferase reporter genes into intact capsid proteins. Afterward, we developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization test (pNT) and evaluated for the specificity and reproducibility. We tested serum samples from a clinical trial on sIPV vaccines by pNT and compared the results with those obtained from conventional neutralization tests (cNT). A strong correlation was observed between two methods, with the correlation coefficients of all three types of IPV vaccines being greater than 0.82 (p < 0.0001). The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) values obtained by pNT were approximately four times higher than that by cNT, revealing the better sensitivity of pNT. In conclusion, pNT is a safe, rapid and sensitive quantitative assay with the potential of being an alternative for the evaluation of the potency of polio vaccines.",

            "text": "Poliomyelitis, caused by poliovirus, is an acute infectious disease that may lead to the acute flaccid paralysis in children. An enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae, poliovirus has three serotypes. The positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome is comprised of a single open reading frame flanked by a 5\u02b9UTR region and a 3\u02b9poly(A) tail. After its entry into the host cell, the virus employs cellular mechanisms to translate the polyprotein. The polyprotein is initially cleaved by the viral proteases such as 2A pro and 3C pro into P1, P2, and P3 proteins, with P1 protein being further cleaved into VP1-VP4 capsid proteins, whereas P2 and P3 into functional proteins for viral replication and packaging. 1, 2 Live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV, made with attenuated strains) has served as the primary tool to eradicate polio worldwide. However, the vaccine has the potential to result in rare adverse cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs), which have become the major concern. According to WHO report, the global annual burden of VAPP is estimated at about 500 cases and total 96 cases of cVDPV occurred in the world last year. 3, 4 Even in highincome countries with all inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV, made with wild strains) immunization schedule, VAPP risks remain; Foiadelli et al. reported the first VAPP case in an immunodeficient infant detected in Albania, which was later confirmed to be a Sabin-like strain in Italy. 5 Clearly, phasing out OPV vaccination eventually is currently on the agenda by the international community. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set the goal of global polio eradication by 2018. For those countries still using the live vaccines, the previous trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) was replaced by the bivalent vaccine (bOPV) in the routine immunization program, along with the introduction of at least one dose of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Given that wild type virus must be handled in level 3 biocontainment laboratories, WHO encourages the development of novel polio vaccines such as IPV based on the attenuated Sabin strains (sIPV). 11 The first sIPV combined with DTaP was approved in Japan in 2012. China approved the stand-alone sIPV the following year, with ongoing development in more manufacturers. 12 The traditional IPV is derived from the wild virus strains (wIPV), mostly Mahoney, MEF-1, and Saukett for type 1, 2 and 3. During clinical evaluation of sIPV vaccine, it is important to determine the cross-protection of the vaccine against the wild virus, which is achieved by carrying out a neutralizing assay using wild-type virus strains (wt virus). However, the wt virus-based neutralizing assay poses a challenge to most OPV vaccine producers, since they are routinely operating the attenuated Sabin strains. In addition to vaccine evaluation in clinical trials, the neutralization test needs to be used in the quality control of IPV, i.e. potency test of final vaccine bulks in rats. Clearly, the use of the wt virus not only presents safety issues to the operators but also potentially results in environmental contamination. Indeed, WHO recommends that tight biosafety measures be taken to prevent leakage of live poliovirus. 13 Therefore, it would be desirable to develop new assays in which no live wt virus would be used. 9 Pseudoviruses are virus-like particles which can replicate for one cycle and are, therefore, considered to have no or minimal biosafety concerns. In recent years, pseudoviruses have been used in place of some wt viruses in neutralizing assays which otherwise must be conducted in level-3 biocontainment laboratories. These viruses include SARS-CoV, H7N9, and MERS. [14] [15] [16] In this study, three pseudoviruses for wild Mahoney, MEF-1, and Saukett strains were constructed and used to develop a neutralization test in place of wt viruses. Here, we report that the new assay is superior to the traditional assays in terms of reproducibility and sensitivity; it could be a viable alternative neutralizing assay for potency analyses of polio vaccines.",

However, the molecular weight of the pseudo-Mahoney VP1 protein is visibly larger than that of the positive control as shown in Western blot. At this time we were unable to explain the observation.

According to GAPIII requirements, neutralization tests with wild strains must be tightly regulated and conducted in level 3 biocontainment laboratories (BSL-3). 10, 13, 18 In this study, we constructed three types of pseudoviruses to replace the wild poliovirus strains in the neutralization method, making it unnecessary to conduct the neutralizing assay at the BLS-3 laboratory. Liu et al. have developed neutralization assay based on pseudovirus originated from Sabin strains with replicons based on the same origin 19 , while Arita et al. developed three serotypes of pseudovirus based on wild-strain, which involved a replicon based on Mahoney virus that has a firefly luciferase gene instead of the capsid coding region. 20 Notably, as the Sabin strain is safer to use, we use the functional gene of the attenuated Sabin2 strain to build a replicon for the Mahoney, MEF-1 and Saukett pseudovirus clones. We found that the structure of the pseudovirus produced by the capsid protein of different wild strains packaging the replicon is correct and the titer meets the experimental requirements. As such, employing the same replicon facilitated the speedier establishment of different type pNT experiment. Different criteria for endpoint calculation were reported when pNT assay was used for the determination of antibody titer. In most reports, RLU threshold values are set as the decrease in RLU by half. [21] [22] [23] [24] Similar criterion was used in this study because results from our three pseudoviruses were highly correlated with those of cNT method, with all correlation coefficients greater than 0.8. In our study, GMT detected using pNT method was approximately four times higher than that detected using cNT method. In addition, our laboratory also constructed Sabin2-based pseudovirus and observed the similar trend (unpublished data). Collectively, these results suggest that pNT established in this report is more sensitive than traditional neutralization assays and could be accurate for the analysis of weakly positive antisera. For example, a sensitive neutralizing assay would be better suited for potency test of sIPV vaccines currently conducted in rats, which usually produce weak antibody responses following immunization of type II of sIPV vaccine (data not shown).",
