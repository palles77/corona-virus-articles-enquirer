            "text": "A miniarray system was developed for the simultaneous detection of porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) and type 2 (PCV2) in pigs. The system consists of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step to amplify target viral DNA, followed by detection of the amplified DNA using a membrane-anchored probe array and an avidin-alkaline phosphatase (Av-AP) indicator system. The lower limit of detection of PCV using the miniarray was 10 1.9 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 )/ml and 10 2.08 TCID 50 /ml for PCV1 and PCV2, respectively, and 100 viral copies/\u03bcl for both PCV1 and PCV2. We validated the miniarray system using 141 lymph node specimens from pigs with suspected postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome or porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome. Of the 141 samples evaluated, 55 were identified as positive for PCV by the miniarray. Relative to in situ hybridization, the sensitivity and specificity of the miniarray was 100% and 98.9%, respectively. In contrast to other microarray systems, the miniarray does not require a DNA chip reader, since the results can be determined by visual inspection of colorized spots on a nylon membrane. This system represents an effective alternative method for the differential detection of PCV1 and PCV2 in pigs, as well as the maintenance of PCV-free cell lines and pre-screening of commercial vaccines for possible contamination.",

Although PCV1 has been recovered from mummified fetuses and one live case of wasting disease (Allan et al. 1995; LeCann et al. 1997) , experimental infection of neonates with PCV1 does not result in clinical symptoms of disease. Thus, PVC1 is considered to be a nonpathogenic virus (Allan et al. 1995; Tischer et al. 1986 ). Recently, three PCV1 isolates were identified in Australia, one from the spleen of a dead weanling pig, a second from the lymph node of an unthrifty weaned pig, and the third from the spinal cord of a newborn pig with associated congenital tremors (Muhling et al. 2006) . PCV1 was also detected in 2 of 18 commercial porcine vaccines, despite testing by the manufacturer for the absence of extraneous viruses (Quintana et al. 2006 ).",

PCV associated disease (PCVAD) defines a spectrum of symptoms that are associated with PCV2, and of late, this disease has been having a severe impact on swine production worldwide. The differential diagnosis of PCV1 and PCV2 has been reported using virus-specific PCR (Hamel et al. 2000; Larochelle et al. 1999; Liu et al. 2000) and in situ hybridization (Kim and Chae 2001) .",

Specimens were classified into two groups according to the presence of PCV genomes in lymphoid tissues (based on in situ hybridization): PCV-negative (n=87) and PCV-positive (n=54). The latter group was further subdivided into five subgroups: PCV1 (n=1), PCV1 & 2 (non-PMWS; n=3), PCV2 (non-PMWS; n=26), PCV2 (PMWS; n=22) and PCV2 (PDNS; n=2) using the three criteria method for PMWS diagnosis (Segal\u00e9s et al. 2005) (Table 1 ). The clinical characterization of pigs in sub-groups PCV1 and non-PMWS included weak or no respiratory symptoms, and slight or non-existent histopathological lesions. The clinical signs of PDNS included skin lesions, anorexia, severe weight loss and depression. Gross skin lesions were typically round or irregularly shaped, red to purple in color and coalesced over the hind-quarters, limbs and abdomen. Pigs also had enlarged kidneys, with pale cortices with multiple red circular hemorrhagic cortical foci measuring approximately 2-4 mm in diameter. PCV1 from porcine kidney cells (ATCC: CCL31) and isolated PCV2 (Accession No: AF520783) were used as positive controls.",

The PCV miniarray primers and probes were designed to specifically amplify PCV1 and PCV2 sequences, and did not match the gene sequences of other porcine pathogens when we searched available sequences using NCBI blast.

            "text": "The sensitivity of miniarrays has been shown to be dependent on the concentration of membrane-bound probe (Bertucci et al. 1999 ). Thus, we required a solid support that had a high capacity to bind small quantities of DNA. The chemical properties of the nylon membrane made it an ideal support for the probe array, because, unlike thin-surface deposition, which is typically used in DNA chip technology, wherein the binding of probes and hybridization are performed on glass or silicon in a three-dimensional system, oligonucleotides can readily penetrate into the nylon membrane of the current miniarray system. Recently, the level of detection of virus by DNA arrays was reported in units of TCID 50 /ml (viral titer), and copy number (viral particles) (Deregt et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2007 ). In our study, the sensitivity of the miniarray for PCV1 and PCV2 was similar when measured by TCID 50 /ml. The minimum viral copy number that could be detected was also similar for the two viruses, and similar to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (de Souza Luna et al. 2007 ). Interestingly, the concentration of PCV2 in pigs with PMWS and PDNS was higher than in pigs with non-PMWS. At the time of reporting, the non-PMWS pigs exhibited some clinical signs or mild degrees of lesions, but only low levels of PCV2 genome in lymphoid tissue (Fort et al. 2007 ). The colorimetric detection system of the current miniarray eliminates the need for specialized equipment, because signals can be detected with the naked eye. However, there is the risk of false-positive or false-negative results due to background interference, such as the false-positive shown for one PCV2-negative sample in this study. When detection is based on a visual reading, as is the case with a variety of commercial antigen or antibody detection kits using immunochromatography method (Anigen Rapid kit, Animal Genetics, Inc), it is important to define the optimal reaction time and virus concentration so as to reduce background color. The optimum reaction time of the current miniarray, during which there was little or no non-specific binding, was approximately 10 min using optimum washing and hybridization.",
