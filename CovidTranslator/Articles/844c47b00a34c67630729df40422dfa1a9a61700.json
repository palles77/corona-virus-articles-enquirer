            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) exists in several closely related serotypes with varying degrees of pathogenicity in mice (8). A number of studies have shown a correlation between the pathogenicity of a certain type of virus and its ability to grow in cultured maeroph~ges (3, 9) . Thus, the non-pathogenic MHV 1 does not replicate in mouse macrophages (1), whereas the pathogenie types MHV2 and MHV3 readily infect mouse peritoneal macrophages (2, 7, 11, 12) . Most strains of mice can be infected with MHV3 with the development of fu]minant hepatitis. Previous studies using A/J strain mice showed that these mice were resistant to MHV3 infection, with only a mild disease occurring with large doses of virus (4, 12). During the first four days of infection virus was recovered from infected mice although there were only minimal changes to their livers (4). However, young A/J strain mice were susceptible up to 3 weeks of age (4). Other mouse strains, including the C57 strain (4, 5, 12) and the A/Sn strain (5) were sensitive to MHV3 infection. Furthermore, VIaELIZIER and ALLISON (12) have reported that there was no detectable growth of MHV3 in macrophagcs from A/J mice; whilst MHV3 replicated in maerophages from C57 strain mice. We were interested in analysing this reported resistance of A/J strain mouse macrophages to MHV3 infection and attempted to repeat this observation by comparing the effect of MHV3 infection on C57, A/Sn and A/J strain mice and their macrophages.",

Extreme care was taken to ensure that these mice had no previous exposure to MHV3 and other pathogens, as certain batches of SPF mice from other sources were found to have antibodies to MHV, and were resistant to infection. MHV3 was obtained from Dr. Tapani Hovi, Clinical Research Centre, Harrow, and was grown in confluent secondary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Monolayers were infected at an input multiplicity of 0.1 infectious particles per cell and, following an adsorption period of 1.5 hours at 37 \u00b0 C, were incubated for 72 hours at 37 \u00b0 C in Eagle's MEM with 2 per cent foetal calf serum (6) . Aliquots of this virus suspension were used after low speed clarification. Unstimulated peritoneal macrophagcs were washed from the peritoneal cavities of mice and were cultured in 30 mm petri dishes in 2 ml of 199 medium, supplemented with 10 per cent. heat inactivated foetal calf serum, at a concentration of 5 x 105 cells per ml (12) . Cultures of adherent maerophages were infected 24 hours after seeding by removing the medium and replacing it with appropriate dilutions of virus in culture medium. The appearance of giant cells was checked after 24, 48 and 72 hours by examining unfixed cultures ~dth an inverted microscope (12) . At 24 hours after infection some cultures were fixed for 1 hour at room temperature in 3 per cent glutaratdehyde buffered with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 per cent sucrose. Fixed cells were subsequently processed for electron microscopy as previously described (i0). For in rive infection, groups of 10 ten-week-old mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of appropriate dilutions of MHV3 in PBSA. The mortality and clinical symptoms were recorded during several weeks after infection.",

Both C57 and A/Sn strain mice were sensitive to similar dilutions of virus and infected mice of both strains showed similar clinical symptoms, developing a fulminant hepatitis and died within 8 days. Mice that did not die after infection showed no symptoms of the disease at any time. However, A/J strain mice were not killed by any of the virus dilutions tested and none of the mice showed any evidence of disease. Similar results were obtained on infecting 5 week old mice with the same MHV3 dilutions. Table 2 shows the results of a typical experiment in which macrophages from i0 week old mice were infected with various MHV3 dilutions. There was a difference in the appearance of CPE in macrophages from different strains of mice on infection with MHV3, as measured by giant cell formation. Although CPE appeared sooner in infected C57 strain macrophages than A/Sn and A/J strain maerophages, the CPE was qualitatively similar for all macrophage strains with a gradual rounding up of the macrophages followed by giant cell formation. Virus replication in the in vitro cultured macrophages was also confirmed by electron microscopy. Fig. 1 shows virus particles present in macrophages from A/J strain mice which had been infected with a virus titre of t02 IDs0 and fixed after 24 hours. A/J strain mouse maerophages infected with 10~ IDs0 of virus did not show a clear cy~opathie effect until 72 hours after infection. However, after 24 hours approximately 10 per cent of these cells were found, by electron microscopy, to contain virus particles. Virus particles were not observed in A/J strain mouse macrophages infected with 101 IDs0 of virus.",
