It causes a spectrum of illness, ranging from mild self-limited fever, to severe and fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever, as evidenced by vascular leakage and multifactorial hemostatic abnormalities. There is no specific treatment available till date. Evidence shows that chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11 and their receptor CXCR3 are involved in severity of dengue, but their genetic association with the susceptibility of vascular leakage during dengue infection has not been reported. We genotyped 14 common variants of these candidate genes in 176 patients infected with dengue. rs4859584 and rs8878 (CXCL10) were significantly associated with vascular permeability of dengue infection (P < 0.05); while variants of CXCL11 showed moderate significance of association (P = 0.0527). Haplotype blocks were constructed for genes CXCL10 and CXCL11 (5 and 7 common variants respectively). Haplotype association tests performed revealed that, ''CCCCA'' of gene CXCL10 and ''AGTTTAC'' of CXCL11 were found to be significantly associated with vascular leakage (P = 0.0154 and 0.0366 respectively). In summary, our association study further strengthens the evidence of the involvement of CXCL10 and CXCL11 in the pathogenesis of dengue infection. \u00d3",

''Original antigenic sin'' and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral replication is the most widely accepted explanation for the association between DHF and pre-existing http antibody [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, it remains uncertain as to how the virushost interaction triggers the inflammatory response resulting in vascular leakage, the hallmark of DHF/DSS, as evidenced by haemoconcentration and/or effusions in the pleural or peritoneal spaces. The fact that the Cuban, Caribbean, and African black populations which share a common ancestry are protected against DHF explains at least partly the role of host genetic variability in this disease susceptibility [8] .",

[9] suggested the involvement of some host candidate genes associated with dengue infection namely, CXCR3 chemokine receptor gene and its ligands chemokine CXCL10 (IP10) and CXCL11 (I-TAC). These genes are commonly involved in the NFkB pathway. Production of these chemokines lead to recruitment of CXCR3 expressing T-cells and NK cells. On top of the in vivo study, earlier studies on gene expression also suggest the involvement of these chemokines in SARS, West Nile virus encephalitis and chronic Hepatitis C patients [10] [11] [12] . We hypothesized that the differential clinical expression of the selected chemokines in different individuals are related to the genetic variation of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 gene, and its ligands CXCL10 and CXCL11. We therefore, attempted to investigate if the risk of acquiring vascular leakage -the hallmark symptom of progression to severe dengue -is attributed to genetic variations in these candidate genes.",

Both hospitals are located in the state of Kelantan; while patients from HSB located in the state of Selangor, were recruited between 2010 and 2012. Blood samples were collected on the first day of admission while the clinical data were retrieved on standardized case report forms, after the patients being discharged. Laboratory confirmation, namely IgM serological test was carried out at the respected hospitals. These tests were independently repeated at least twice to confirm the results in our laboratory in addition to IgG serological test.

CXCL10 variant namely rs8878, located at the 3 0 -UTR, is believed to affect RNA-binding protein important for efficient translation of this gene via RNA stabilization [28] . It has been associated with autoimmune diseases like type-I diabetes [29] , and severe acute respiratory syndrome amongst Chinese [30] . As for another SNP with significant association, rs4859584, a search in dbSNP though revealed no known disease association was reported [31] . Function prediction analysis performed using FastSNP [32] suggested that both rs8878 and rs4859584 might play a role as an intronic enhancer.",

Analysis of haplotypes from a LD block has been a powerful tool to localize the candidate region(s) underlying complex diseases as it increases the statistical power to assess an association over an individual marker [34] . In this study, haplotype analysis further assured the influence of CXCL10 and CXCL11 in susceptibility of vascular permeability in dengue.",
