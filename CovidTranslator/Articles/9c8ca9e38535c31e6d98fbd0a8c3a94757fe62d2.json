Overall, the adaptive immune response to PRRS virus (PRRSV) is weak, which results in delayed elimination of virus from the host and inferior vaccine protection. PRRSV has been shown to induce a meager alpha interferon (IFN-\u2423) response, and we hypothesized that elevated IFN-\u2423 levels early in infection would shorten the induction time and increase elements of the adaptive immune response. To test this, we measured both antibody and cell-mediated immunity in pigs after the administration of a nonreplicating human adenovirus type 5 vector expressing porcine IFN-\u2423 (Ad5-pIFN-\u2423) at the time of PRRSV infection and compared the results to those for pigs infected with PRRSV alone. Viremia was delayed, and there was a decrease in viral load in the sera of pigs administered the Ad5-pIFN-\u2423. Although seroconversion was slightly delayed in pigs receiving Ad5-pIFN-\u2423, probably due to the early reduction in viral replication, little difference in the overall or neutralizing antibody response was seen. However, there was an increase in the number of virus-specific IFN-\u2425-secreting cells detected in the pigs receiving Ad5-pIFN-\u2423, as well as an altered cytokine profile in the lung at 14 days postinfection, indicating that the presence of IFN-\u2423 at the time of infection can alter innate and adaptive immune responses to PRRSV.",

Compared to other viruses that infect the respiratory epithelial cells, such as swine influenza virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus, PRRSV appears to induce only modest levels of alpha interferon (IFN-\u2423) and proinflammatory cytokines (1, 14, 18, 25, 37) . Additionally, the host response following PRRSV infection has been characterized as both ineffective and delayed. Although nonneutralizing antibodies are rapidly produced following infection, there is a deficiency in neutralizing antibody production (40) . Cell-mediated immune responses, typically measured by increases in PRRSV-specific IFN-\u2425-producing cells, can take 4 to 8 weeks to develop (4, 16, 22) . Several groups have reported increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in response to PRRSV infection and suggested that this may be immunosuppressive, since IL-10 has been shown to suppress antigenpresenting cell activities, such as processing and presenting antigen, and IL-1, IL-12, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423), and type I IFN expression (8, 10, 26, 33, 34) .",

            "text": "Type I interferons, such as IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424, have an important role in the innate and adaptive immune response. They contribute to innate antiviral immunity by promoting production of antiviral mediators such as PKR (double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase) and Mx (myxovirus resistant; IFN-inducible GTPase) and elicit NK cell activity for the killing of virus-infected cells (2, 3, 13, 27) . IFN-\u2423 and -\u2424 also play a role in the adaptive immune response by inducing both the maturation of dendritic cells into professional antigen-presenting cells and macrophage development and maturation and, along with IL-6, promoting B cell differentiation into plasma cells (5, 11, 21) . Several mechanisms as to how PRRSV inhibits type I IFN production have been proposed, and multiple mechanisms may apply. PRRSV has been shown to inhibit double-stranded RNA activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) via inactivation of IFN-\u2424 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), an adaptor molecule in the retinoic acidinducible gene 1 (RIG-1) pathway (20) . Others have proposed that PRRSV interferes with modification of IB through either nsp2 ovarian tumor domain-mediated inhibition of polyubiquitination or nsp1\u2423-mediated inhibition of phosphorylation, ultimately leading to impairment of NF-B activity (31, 32) .",

The goal of this study was to test the effect of elevated IFN-\u2423 early in infection on the timing and quality of the adaptive immune response to PRRSV. Because there is little IFN-\u2423 produced during PRRSV infection and IFN-\u2423 plays a role in the development of the adaptive immune response as well as the innate immune response, we hypothesized that this might be one reason that there is an inadequate adaptive response to the virus. To test this hypothesis, we followed aspects of the adaptive immune response, both antibody-and cell-mediated immunity, in pigs simultaneously administered Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 and PRRSV and compared them to the response in pigs exposed only to PRRSV.",

To better evaluate neutralizing antibody responses, an FFN assay was performed. While there was a trend toward increased neutralizing antibody levels and a more rapid appearance of neutralizing antibody (day 21) in the group given Ad5-pIFN-\u2423, the differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 3b) .",

It can exert potent antiviral effects by initiating the production of various antiviral mediators that hinder viral replication and packaging. IFN-\u2423 can also act on antigen-presenting cells to enhance their ability to activate lymphocytes through production of cytokines and expression of antigen-presentation molecules. In addition, IFN-\u2423 can act directly on T cells to drive maturation from a na\u00efve T cell to an effector cell (12) . IFN-\u2423 is typically produced in response to a viral infection, but it is well accepted that PRRSV does not induce a strong IFN-\u2423 response, which may secondarily affect development of the adaptive immune response. It has been hypothesized that administration of IFN-\u2423, as a recombinant protein or through in vivo expression of the cloned gene, may enhance the host response to PRRSV, aiding in clearance and increased adaptive immunity.",

However, effects on development of the antigen-specific immune response were not considered in that first study. The study reported here was extended to 56 days postinfection in order to monitor PRRSV-specific responses. The timing of Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 administration was also altered to assess the effectiveness of the construct as a potential adjuvant or metaphylactic when given coincident with potential exposure to PRRSV, for example, when pigs are moved to a new facility and/or mixed with pigs potentially infected with PRRSV. Similar to the results reported in the prior study, in the current study there was an initial delay in the detection of vRNA in the sera of pigs given the Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 construct, concurrent with the time at which serum IFN-\u2423 levels were highest (6) . Whereas by day 3 postinfection most of the pigs in the previous experiment were viremic whether or not they received IFN-\u2423, the majority of pigs receiving IFN-\u2423 in this experiment did not become viremic until day 4. This is likely due to the timing of Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 administration. Specifically, Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 was given 1 day prior to infection in the previous experiment, as opposed to the same day as PRRSV challenge in this experiment. Unlike the previous experiment, however, exposure to IFN-\u2423 did result in a significant decrease in the amount of PRRS vRNA between days 5 and 9 postinfection, although it did not affect the incidence of viremia during the same time period. Thus, while administration of the Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 construct did not prevent the occurrence of viremia, it did significantly decrease the amount of vRNA circulating in the blood. Our data demonstrate that a single dose of Ad5-pIFN-\u2423, when administered on the same day as PRRSV challenge, can control early viral replication and viremia and lower peak virus levels found in the serum.",

This mirrors the delay in viremia observed in our previous experiment giving Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 1 day prior to challenge with PRRSV (6). In the current experiment, not only was there a delay in the onset of viremia but also there were subsequently decreased viral loads in the peripheral blood as well. Thus, it is unlikely that Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 alone controlled viral loads in the current experiment because we would have expected vRNA levels to be the same between groups once IFN-\u2423 levels returned to normal in the Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 group, which was by day 3. Because vRNA levels remained relatively low in the Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 group, we speculate that additional control/ activation mechanisms were initiated with Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 administration. Further work is warranted to understand the innate antiviral response and to define mechanisms of controlling viral load at early time points following Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 administration.",

Seroconversion, as measured by IDEXX ELISA, was delayed in pigs given the Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 construct compared to pigs given the Ad5-null construct, presumably due to the delay in viral replication and/or antigen load. However, this was detected only on day 7 postinfection, and there was no significant difference between the groups by day 9 postinfection. Neutralizing antibody titers also did not differ significantly between the two groups, though a trend toward increased neutralization titers on days 21 and 28 in the Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 group was appreciated. There was, however, an increase in the number of antigen-specific ISCs in the periphery of pigs given the Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 construct. These results are similar to those reported by Meier et al., who coadministered IFN-\u2423 with a modified live PRRSV vaccine and found an increase in PRRSV antigen-specific ISCs but no effect on the production of antivirus antibodies (23) . IFN-\u2423 is known to have effects on antigen-presenting cells but has also been shown to act directly on na\u00efve T cells to drive differentiation into effector T cells (reviewed in reference 12). The contribution of ISCs to PRRSV clearance has not been clearly defined, and it is difficult to assess their contribution in the current study, as viral clearance or control in the sera was apparent on day 21 postinfection but PRRSV ISCs were not detectable in the peripheral blood until day 28 postinfection. Neutralizing antibody titers were detectable in a few pigs in the Ad5-pIFN-\u2423 group on day 21, although viral loads were decreasing by this time point. There are several reports suggesting that neutralizing antibodies do not correlate with decreased viremia (29, 41) , while some papers suggest that titers must be extremely high to provide protection (17, 28) . Since we did not attempt rechallenge, we do not know whether the changes in the immune response to PRRSV seen in the presence of IFN-\u2423 would have been more efficacious in preventing clinical signs or inducing viral clearance in pigs reexposed to homologous or heterologous PRRSV. Further studies would be needed to explore this possibility.",
