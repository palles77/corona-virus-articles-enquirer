It is estimated that approximately 15% of HCV-infected individuals eliminate the virus spontaneously, whereas 25% develop a mild form of the disease and 60% progress to the chronic form. Fibrosis is the principal complication of chronic hepatitis C, which increases both morbidity and mortality because of complications such as cirrhosis or hepatocarcinoma.",

Three MASPs have been described: MASP-1, -2, and -3. MASP-2 plays the predominant functional role in the activation of the lectin pathway [6] , whereas MASP-2 forms complexes with the pattern recognition molecules MBL and ficolins (H-ficolin, L-ficolin, or M-ficolin) and is activated when one of these proteins recognizes micro-organisms leading to the subsequent cleavage of C4 and C2, thus initiating complement cascade activation [7, 8] . HCV encodes two highly glycosylated envelope proteins, E1 and E2, which are potential targets for interaction with MBL and ficolins [9] .",

            "text": "MASP-2 is encoded by the MASP2 gene in the chromosome 1p36.23-31. The mRNA is encoded by 11 exons, of which a single exon encodes the linker region and the serine protease domain [10] . The MASP-2 protein is composed of six modules and a linker region: an N-terminal CUB domain (CUB1) followed by epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of Ca 2\u03e9 binding type, a second CUB domain (CUB-2), 2 contiguous complement control protein modules (CCP1 and CCP2), a short linker, and finally, a chymotrypsinlike serine protease (SP) domain. The interaction with MBL and L-ficolin is determined by N-terminal CUB1-EGF moiety but is strengthened by the presence of the CUB2 module [11] . Two complement control protein (CCP) molecules and the SP domain perform the catalytic activity of the entire molecule and CCP2 retains the essential role in C4 cleavage [12] . MBL deficiency, occurring at a frequency of about 2-10%, is the most common congenital immunodeficiency, and is associated with susceptibility to infection and autoimmune disorders [13] . Inherited MASP-2 deficiency has been described as the result of a mutation causing the exchange of aspartic acid with glycine at the 105th position in the first domain CUB1, involved in calcium binding. This mutation prohibits binding to MBL and ficolins, and deprives MASP-2 of functional activity. The frequency of this gene mutation among Caucasian individuals is 3.6% [11] .",

All patients had positive anti-HCV atibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and positive viral RNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Amplicor HCV, version 2.0; Roche, Branchburg, NJ). Only patients more than 18 years of age and with stage F2 or higher liver fibrosis according to the Metavir classification were included [15] . The exclusion criteria were as follows: alcohol use (\u03fe20 g or 40 g daily for women and men, respectively), co-infection with hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and presence of any other liver or systemic disease. Most patients were treated with conventional interferon-\u2423 (IFN-\u2423) or with pegylated_IFN-\u2423 (pgIFN) associated with ribavirin. MBL2 genotyping was determined previously using a real-time polymerase chain reaction with fluorescent hybridization probes [14] .

Although the complement cascade activation in the presence of the p.D371Y variant (c.1111 G \u03fe T) was not analyzed in the present study, we speculate that in individuals homozygous for this polymorphism, MASP-2 may be less functional. It is possible that the amino acid change in this position causes modification in the catalytic region of the enzyme, altering the substrate specificity. Although the conversion of aspartic acid to tyrosine in p.D371Y (c.1111 G \u03fe T) can be accommodated in the molecule without disturbing its overall structure, it is possible that this variation has a functional effect in response to HCV infection.

(2008) [14] , studying the MBL2 gene polymorphism of the promoter region and exon 1 in patients with chronic disease, reported that some genotypes (XA/ XA, XA/YO and YO/YO) were associated with lower levels of MBL in patients and that MBL2 polymorphisms may therefore be associated with development of chronic hepatitis C. Halla et al. (2010) [25] , investigating the MBL2 gene in 186 Brazilian HCV patients, suggested that the HYO haplotype could be associated with HCV infection and liver fibrosis.",
