This paper examines whether the geographic proximity of information disseminated by the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak events combined with intense media coverage affected stock prices in the U.S. We find that the Ebola outbreak event effect is the strongest for the stocks of companies with exposure of their operations to the West African countries (WAC) and the U.S. and for the events located in the WAC and the U.S. This result suggests that the information about Ebola outbreak events is more relevant for companies that are geographically closer to both the birthplace of the Ebola outbreak events and the financial markets. The results also show that the effect is more pronounced for small and more volatile stocks, stocks of specific industry, and for the stocks exposed to the intense media coverage. The event effect is also followed by the elevated perceived risk; that is, the implied volatility increases after the Ebola outbreak events.",

Motivated by Francis et al.

We classify the U.S. publicly listed companies into three groups depending on whether their operations have exposure to the U.S. only, the West African countries (WAC) 1 , and Europe. We also distinguish among the Ebola outbreak events depending on where they occur (i.e., in the U.S., the WAC or Europe). We find that the Ebola outbreak event effect is the strongest for the stocks of companies with exposure of their operations to the WAC and the U.S. for the events located in the WAC and the U.S. This result suggests that the information about Ebola outbreak events is more relevant for companies that are geographically closer to both the birthplace of the Ebola outbreak events and the financial markets.",

(2004) study the intensity of media coverage of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) disease outbreak. They find that the media tends to disproportionately cover rare events, new events, and dramatic events-the ones that kill many people at once. Hence, as shown by Kepplinger and Hans Mathias (2008) , when an unusual event occurs, the media starts hunting \"newer\" news on the same specific topic. Klibanoff et al. (1998) show that investors assign more importance to news to which more attention has been given by the media than to news to which less importance has been assigned even if the news items R. Ichev, M. Marin\u010d International Review of Financial Analysis 56 (2018) 153-166 have the same fundamental value. More specifically, Klibanoff et al. (1998) collect country-specific news reported on the New York Times front page and test investors' misperceptions, where investors incorrectly perceive the signals while predicting future fundamental security price behavior. The study finds that some investors react more to the fundamentals after well announced/publicized news thus affecting prices directly (see also Mairal, 2011; Peress, 2008) . Fang and Peress (2009) conduct research on media coverage and a cross-section of stock returns. They highlight the impact of the media on financial markets by studying return premiums on stocks for stocks with a media coverage versus stocks without a media coverage. Fang and Peress (2009) find that, on average, stocks not featured in the media gain 0.20% more per month than stocks that are covered more often. Peress (2014) investigates the causal impact of the media on trading and price formation by observing newspaper strikes in several countries. He finds that, on strike days, trading volume falls by 12%, the dispersion of the stock returns and returns' intraday volatility is reduced by 7% whereas the aggregate returns show no signals. Donadelli (2015) measures policy-related uncertainty based on the volume of Google searches. He finds that a Google-searched-based uncertainty shock has sizable adverse effects on the U.S. macroeconomic conditions and it negatively affects the industrial production, equity prices, consumer sentiment, and consumer credit.",

Their study finds that a local press coverage increases the trading volume of local investors up to 50%. Their results show that the media stimulates a local trading activity and that a geographic proximity matters. Differently than Engelberg and Parsons (2011) , we examine the media coverage of global events having impact on companies exposed to different continental (geographic) locations of operations.

We look at as many previous days' returns as is necessary to ensure that all significant correlations have been accounted for. In our case, it is the rates of return of the first five previous days. Following French (1980) , Schwert (1990a) , and Cho et al.

We use dummies for each day of the week, WD it , to capture the so-called \"Monday effects\" or \"weekend effect.\" 10 Lastly, we add a dummy for the first five days of the taxation year, Tax t , starting at January 1, to account for the so-called \"turn-of-the-year effect\" (see, e.g., Chien and Chen, 2008) 11 To account for a potential reversal effect (driven by positive/ 7 Operation ownership: the company needs to have min 50.01% of known shareholders in the country of domicile and at least one subsidiary, affiliate or branch located in the region of interest.

Table 2 reveals the regression results, where each dependent variable is the daily rate of return on a portfolio comprised of stocks belonging to a firm-size decile. Deciles rank from 1 to 10, where decile 1 is composed of the largest firms by size and decile 10 is composed of the smallest firms by size. Similarly to Fig. 2f depicts companies trading volume, price range, and bid-ask spreads under high intensity of media coverage. The abnormal return on day t is calculated as the difference between the observed rate of return and the ex-post expected rate of return on day t. The one-factor market model r it = \u03b1 0 + \u03b2 1 r m,t + \u03b5 t , where r it is the return on stock i in period t and r m,t is the S&P 500 return, is estimated using a 100-day estimation window. The event selection procedure follows the last/first occurrence criteria which yields to a total number of 40 event days with non-overlapping event windows during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak period.",

Lastly, to control for possible reversal effects we return to the regression analysis in Eq. (4). On the day following the event day, the gap between the most extreme portfolios widens even more, potentially as a result of an investor reaction to the previous day event (from \u2212 0.0140 for decile 1 to \u22120.0524 for decile 10). We observe statistically significant reversal effects up to the third trading day after the event day (see Table A .11 in the Appendix).",

It reveals a strong effect on the day of the event (at t = 0) and a mild persistence of the effect on the first day following the event day. In addition, we do not observe a return to the prevailing average value before the event. This result complies with previous findings showing that the market volatility is persistent (e.g., Baker and Wurgler, 2007) . To test the significance of the volatility represented by VIX and VXO, we employ a matched-pair t-test. We observe statistically significant increase in volatility on the event day with t-values of t = 4.579 (P < 0.001) and t = 4.013 (P < 0.028) for VIX and VXO respectively.",

For example, Schwert (2003) analyzes a long-time period of market volatility and finds that the monthly stock volatility was higher during banking crises and economic recessions.

On the other side, there is a persistence of the effect on the days following the event day. On these days, when the media is usually flooded with information on possibly disastrous causalities accompanied with live streaming and pictures, we detect a negative effect but of a smaller magnitude. Table A .9 in the Appendix presents the results of the event study methodology that observe the impact of the intense media coverage on securities' performance around the event dates. Trading volume as a proxy for trading intensity shows an erratic behavior one day before the event day and up until three days after the event. Past research documents that unexpected and high-consequence events contribute to the trade turbulence in the markets increasing the volume of trades exponentially (Peress, 2014) . The coefficients of the proxies for stock variability and liquidity-the price range and the bid-ask spread-increase only on the day of the event and they trend downward subsequently. This is consistent with our hypothesis that intense media coverage significantly affects stock returns, trading volume, stock liquidity, and stock variability and corroborates the results by Fang and Peress (2009) .",
