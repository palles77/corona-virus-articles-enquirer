The study was conducted in a 184-bed geriatric department in a university hospital during 4 winter months. All consecutive elderly persons admitted with a lower respiratory tract infection were included in the study. Clinical and laboratory parameters, a nasopharyngeal swab, and serological results for respiratory viruses were obtained for all participants. Available blood and sputum cultures were analysed. A total of 165 elderly persons (mean age, 82\u20ac6.8 years) were hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection. Familial flu-like illness (OR, 4.25; 95%CI, 1.4-13), better functionality (OR, 4; 95%CI, 1.3-14.15), and leucocyte count <10 10 /l (OR, 3; 95%CI, 1.3-7.1) were predictive for viral lower respiratory tract infection. Sixty (36.5%) definite diagnoses (positive blood culture, viral culture, or serological test) and seven (4.2%) probable diagnoses (positive sputum culture) were obtained. An early diagnosis (within 72 h) was possible in 38 (23%) and a late diagnosis in 29 (17.6%) participants. A nasopharyngeal swab contributed in 60.5% of the cases to an early diagnosis. Viral culture identified half (22/43) of the lower respiratory tract infections caused by influenza but only one of six lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus. In conclusion, a history of flu-like illness in family members and a total leucocyte count within normal limits makes a viral cause more likely in elderly people hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection during winter. Viral culture and rapid antigen detection are insensitive in elderly patients hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection.",

This demonstrates the need for active surveillance in the community and even in the hospital setting for influenza when influenza infection is sought based on clinical judgment. The lower predictive value in our analysis is partially due to the restriction of our population to LRTI in which fever (59%), cough (88%), and acute onset (76%) are prevalent and to the exclusion of influenza-like illness without LRTI symptoms and admissions for cardiac conditions that could have been caused by viral infections.",

Better diagnostic tools are required to identify bacterial and viral causes of LRTI in order to more adequately stratify initial therapeutic and preventive approaches. Molecular diagnostic tests (e.g., real-time polymerase chain reaction) may offer new opportunities in this respect.",
