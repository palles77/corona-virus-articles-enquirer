Type B3 coxsackievirus (CVB3), a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus of the Enterovirus genus, is one of most common agent of viral myocarditis. Till now, effective treatments for VMC are lacking due to lack of drugs or vaccine. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is applied in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders. Accumulating evidence have demonstrated that LiCl, also as an effective antiviral drug, exhibited antiviral effects for specific viruses. However, there are few reports of evaluating LiCl's antiviral effect in mice model. Here, we investigated the inhibitory influence of LiCl on the CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo and the development of CVB3-induced VMC. We found that LiCl significantly suppressed CVB3 replication in HeLa via inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment in vivo obviously inhibited virus replication within the myocardium and alleviated CVB3-induced acute myocarditis. Collectively, our data demonstrated that LiCl inhibited CVB3 replication and negatively regulated virus-triggered inflammatory responses.",

Therefore, we studied the antiviral effects of LiCl in HeLa cells and in CVB3-infected mouse. The results indicate that LiCl acts as a potential antiviral agent to significantly inhibit CVB3 replication through decreasing virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment could markedly suppress the cardiac virus replication and alleviate the progress of myocarditis in mice, which might expand LiCl's new application in virus-induced inflammatory diseases. 5 About 6-8 weeks-old male BALB/c mice (16-18g) were obtained from (Shanghai Slac Animal Inc.). All mice were handled in conformity with the institutional guidelines of Soochow University were approved by the Ethics Committee. Professor Yingzhen Yang (Key Laboratory of Viral Heart Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University) provided the CVB3-eGFP and CVB3 (Nancy strain). They were tittered by TCID 50 assay on HeLa cells. HeLa and 293T cell-lines were bought from the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and maintained as detailed before [17] .

As expected, the viral RNA level was obviously decreased in hearts of mice after LiCl treatment (Fig. 5C ). LiCl treatment also significantly decreased the activity of serum creatine kinase (CK) and echocardiographic measurements showed that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were markedly increased after treated with LiCl, which suggested that LiCl could obviously improve the cardiac function ( Fig. 5D-E) . Consistently, HE staining analysis displayed that control mice showed severe myocarditis with necrotic lesions and inflammation, LiCl treatment significantly alleviated myocarditis with less inflammatory foci and necrosis (Fig. 5F-G) . IHC analysis showed that LiCl treatment decreased the expression of cleaved caspase 3 within the myocardium, which 9 further supported that LiCl inhibit virus-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis (Fig. 5H) .To further verify the role of LiCl on the inflammation within the myocardium, we analyzed the productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hearts by Q-PCR. As shown in Fig. 5E , the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly decreased after LiCl injection while anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was slightly increased with LiCl treatment (Fig. 5I) .

GSK3\u03b2 regulates a wide range of cellular functions, including protein translation, cell cycle, development and apoptosis. GSK3\u03b2 regulates apoptosis in a variety of cell types [20, 21] . It is well-known that interferon (IFN) pathway plays a key role on virus replication and GSK3\u03b2 is also reported to regulate IFN-\u03b2 production.

Besides, we also checked type-I interferon responses in mouse peritoneal macrophages after CVB3 stimulation. We found that IFN-\u03b2 production was induced by CVB3 and inhibited after LiCl treatment, which cannot explain LiCl's antiviral effect on CVB3 infection. Moreover, it seems that IFN-\u03b2 inhibition induced by LiCl in immune cells also apply to other virus or stimuli. We found similar result in Sendai virus (SeV) infected peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). Wang et.al also reported similar phenotype. They found that, in macrophages, LiCl attenuated IFN-\u03b2 production and IFN regulatory factor 3 activation induced by LPS-, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-, and SeV, but this is in a glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2-independent manner [22] .",

So we next analyzed the LiCl's effect on the apoptosis of HeLa or 293T cells by staining Annexin V and 7-AAD. The result of the flow cytometry revealed that compared with control, LiCl at concentrates of 30 mM and 50 mM could not induce cell apoptosis in HeLa or 293T (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we chose the concentration of 50 mM as the maximum concentration of LiCl for antiviral experiments.",

            "text": ". In 2005, J Yuan et.al reported that CVB3 infection activated GSK3\u03b2 pathway and inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 suppressed CVB3-induced CPE and apoptosis via stabilizing \u03b2-catenin [27]. Consistently, our results also demonstrated that LiCl treatment could significantly inhibit CVB3-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. So far, the antiviral properties of LiCl in viral infected-animal model have not been fully explored. We deeply explore the role of LiCl on viral myocarditis in mouse and revealed that LiCl treatment could markedly restrict virus replication in heart tissues and alleviate the inflammation within the myocardium. Here, we report that LiCl restricts the replication of CVB3 through inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis, thus expanding the range of LiCl targets to CVB3. Moreover, we also confirm the antiviral potential of LiCl in hearts of VMC mice and demonstrated that LiCl potently protects mice against CVB3-induced myocarditis, indicating a therapeutic target of LiCl in virus-induced inflammatory diseases.Formatting of funding sourcesThis work was supported by Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (31400769, 31870903, 31870868, and 31670930), Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation (BK20140371) and Jiangsu Postdoctor Science Foundation (1402176C), Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.
