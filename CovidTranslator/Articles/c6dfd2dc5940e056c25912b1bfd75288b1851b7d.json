            "text": "SIR,-ProfessQr Dudley attributes to \" the weight and tradition behind examining \" the persistence of examiners in setting essay questions despite Bull's finding that he and his colleagues often gave different marks for the same questions. In my experience this is not the right reason. Many schools have been experimenting continually with different forms of examination and find that the essay paper, with or without an oral examination, is the best if not the only acceptable one for making the pass/fail decisions required of them. An experienced examiner has little difficulty in classifying an essay answer into one of three categories, very good (honours), adequate (pass), or inadequate (fail). Converting this into an actual mark is merely adding plus or minus signs to the prime judgment. Differences between actual marks given by different examiners for the same answer are to be expected, especially if a close marking system is not used. But there should be little discrepancy between prime judgments on any essay if the examiners are reasonably competent and conscientious and are briefed in the form of the examination.",

Deciding on a \" pass \" mark in a multiple-choice-question score is an arbitrary exercise. If such a mark is needed, it is usually worked out by calibration against the results of the essay section of the examination. It would be illogical to say that a person reaches pass standard by being correct 50% or 75% of the time; it all depends on the questions.",

However, they are no substitute for essays and orals in professional examinations, as the persistence of the latter forms of examination clearly indicate.
