All of the extracted cerebellum sections had positive test results (cycle threshold range 33-36); the extraction and PCR controls all showed negative results. To confirm these positive results, conventional RT-PCR was used to amplify a 573-nt sequence of the SBV S segment. The amplification product was sequenced, and a BLAST analysis was performed (www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). An identity of 100% was obtained with the SBV small gene segment from a ruminant (Gen-Bank accession no. KC108860). An immunohistochemical assay was also performed; the result was negative.",

The absence of detectable SBV antibodies in the puppy in this investigation suggests that transplacental infection occurred before the onset of fetal immune competence. Maternal infection probably occurred in January or February 2012; entomologic monitoring conducted in France showed the presence of Culicoides spp. midges, a vector of SBV, during this period in northwestern France. In addition, because the puppies were born in March 2012 and SBV antibodies were still detectable in the mother in March 2013, the duration of SBV antibodies in dogs appears to be >1 year. In cattle and sheep, the SBV genome persists in an infected fetus and is detectable after birth by real-time RT-PCR, despite gestation length (5, 6) .",

The geographic sources of infection have yet to be fully clarified, and confirmed human cases from 1 province have not been linked to those from other provinces. While some studies have identified epidemiologic characteristics of subtype H7N9 cases and clinical differences between these cases and cases of highly pathogenic influenza A(H5N1), another avian influenza affecting parts of China (2-4), the spatial epidemiology of human infection with influenza subtypes H7N9 and H5N1 in China has yet to be elucidated. To test the hypothesis of co-distribution of high-risk clusters of both types of infection, we used all available data on human cases in mainland China and investigated the geospatial epidemiologic features.",

To identify a spatial overlap between the primary cluster of influenza (H7N9) cases, detected in April 2013 (relative risk [RR] 78.40; p<0.01), and the earliest space-time cluster of influenza (H5N1) cases, detected during November 2005-February 2006 (RR 65.27; p<0.01), we used spatiotemporal scan statistics with a maximum spatial cluster size of 5% of the population at risk in the spatial window and a maximum temporal cluster size of 25% of the study period in the temporal window (6) (Figure) . The results suggest that the overlap is not perfect and is concentrated around an area southeast of Taihu Lake (south of Jiangsu Province), bordering the provinces of Anhui and Zhejiang. Smaller clusters of influenza (H7N9) cases were identified in the boundary of Jiangsu and Anhui Province (8 cases; RR 64.86; p<0.01) and Jiangxi Province (Nanchang County and Qingshanhu District) (4 cases; RR 105.67; p<0.01).
