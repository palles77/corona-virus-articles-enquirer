However, no previous study has explored the activity of Peperomia sui against influenza virus infections. This study was carried out to evaluate the anti-influenza virus activity and the potential virucidal effect of the ethanolic extract of Peperomia sui (PSE). Methods: The anti-H6N1 avian influenza viral activity of PSE against the influenza virus A/Chicken/TW/ 0518/2011 (H6N1) in chicken fibroblast DF-1 cells was evaluated by cell viability assay, hemagglutination assay, neuraminidase activity assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay and quantitative RT-PCR assay. Results: PSE significantly increased the viability of cells that were infected by the H6N1 virus. PSE also suppressed the synthesis of viral nucleoprotein (NP), and inhibited the growth of the virus in DF-1 cells. Further, PSE inhibited the neuraminidase activity of H6N1 virus. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide important information for the exploitation and utilization of Peperomia sui in treatment of influenza infection.",

In brief, H6N1 viruses were incubated with various concentrations of PSE for 10 min at 37 1C, and then the neuraminidase substrate, 4-MU-NANA [2-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-A-d-nacetylneuraminic acid sodium] was added and incubated for 2 h in the dark. The luminescence signal indicating neuraminidase activity was determined with fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation 365 nm, emission 460 nm).",

The column temperature was maintained at room temperature. UV detection of samples was performed at a wavelength of 350 nm, and the injection volume was 20 \u03bcL. The gradient mobile phase used for analysis was mixed by solvent A (0.1% phosphoric acid solution) and solvent B (acetonitrile). A flow rate of 1 ml/min under the initial condition of 75:25 (A/B) was used. The solvent B was brought to 40% for 15 min, up to 100% for 5 min, and switch to 25% for 5 min. PSE was completely separated by the above gradient elution. HPLC fingerprint chromatogram was established for the quantification and quality control of the isolated sample, which showed scutellarein at 8.5 min, luteolin at 11.0 min, apigenin at 15.0 min. The standard chemicals of scutellarein, luteolin, and apigenin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA).",

Treatment of DF-1 cells with 100 \u03bcg/ml PSE significantly reduced the CPE produced by the virus (Fig. 1B) . MTT assays revealed that PSE dose-dependently increased the viability of virus-infected cells, and the EC 50 value was 34.8 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 1C) .

In the current study, three flavonoid compounds, scutellarein, luteolin and apigenin, were identified in PSE.

Apigenin and luteolin are previously shown to inhibit influenza A virus neuraminidases ( Liu et al., 2008; Grienke et al., 2012) , and they can effectively reduce neuraminidase activity of H5N1 virus (Sithisarn et al., 2013) . In this study, the PSE-mediated inhibition of the growth of influenza virus H6N1 might also be due to anti-influenza viral effects from apigenin and luteolin.
