Cell fusion can be induced at physiological pH by paramyxoviruses, either among cells treated under conditions of fusion from without, or among infected cells with fusion from within [1, 6] . A specific glycoprotein component (F) of the paramyxovirus envelope is known to be involved in this membrane fusion activity. The precursor form of the F protein which is expressed at the surface of nonpermissive cells can be activated by treatment with an exogenous protease that cleaves the precursor at a specific site [10, 11] .",

B Smaller poIykaryons (arrowheads) develop when the trypsin treatment is limited to a 2 h period (20 to 22 h). C No polykaryons develop in the absence of trypsin. Bars = Trypsin activation of BCV-induced polykaryocytosis. Infected monolayers were exposed to trypsin for a single 2 or 4 h interval as indicated. Maximum polykaryocytosis occurred in cultures exposed to trypsin during the period from 18 to 22 h post infection treatment. Some BCV replication apparently proceeded in the absence of trypsin. The addition of trypsin to infected cultures at 3 h increased the yield of infectious virus by 38 % and the hemagglutination titer rose. Addition of trypsin inhibitor to infected cultures decreased the infectivity yield by 39% without affecting the hemagglutination titer. Experiments conducted to identify the period of virus infection susceptible to trypsin activation of fusion revealed that the onset of cell-to-cell fusion occurred at about 18 h after infection with continuous trypsin treatment. This treatment resulted in large multinucleated cells by 26 h",
