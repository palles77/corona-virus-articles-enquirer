The present study first screened that the DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 (DDX5) was a cellular protein interacting with the Nsp9 of PRRSV by a yeast two-hybrid method in a pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) cDNA library. Next, DDX5 was shown to interact with viral Nsp9 in the co-transfected HEK293 cells with the DDX5-and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, and the interaction between endogenous DDX5 and Nsp9 was also confirmed in MARC-145 cells infected with the Nsp9-expressing lentiviruses. Then, the interacting domains between DDX5 and Nsp9 were determined to be the DEXDc and HELICc domains in DDX5 and the RdRp domain in Nsp9, respectively. Moreover, in the HEK293 cells, MARC-145 cells and PAM cell lines co-transfected with the DDX5and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, Nsp9 was shown to co-localize with DDX5 in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear pattern, and meanwhile in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and PAMs, endogenous DDX5 was also found to co-localize with Nsp9. Finally, silencing the DDX5 gene in MARC-145 cells significantly impacted the replication of PRRSV, and while the over-expression of DDX5 could slightly enhance viral replication. These findings indicate that DDX5 positively regulates the replication of PRRSV via its interaction with viral Nsp9 in vitro.",

The PRRS virus (PRRSV), the causative agent, is classified in the genus Arterivirus of the family Arteriviridae (Cavanagh, 1997) , and has antigenically and genetically distinct two types-European genotype (type 1) and North American genotype (type 2) (Meng et al., 1995; Nelson et al., 1993) . The genome of PRRSV is a single-strand, positivesense RNA of approximately 15 kb in length, which contains at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) (Conzelmann et al., 1993; Johnson et al., 2011; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . The ORF1a and ORF1b occupying 80% of the genome encode two viral replicase polyproteins-pp1a and pp1ab. The pp1a is processed into ten nonstructural proteins (Nsps) including Nsp1\u2423, Nsp1\u2424, Nsp2 to Nsp6, Nsp7\u2423, Nsp7\u2424 and Nsp8, while the pp1ab is cleaved into Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp11 and Nsp12 which are recognized to be involved in viral genome transcription and replication (Bautista et al., 2002; den Boon et al., 1995; Fang and Snijder, 2010; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; van Dinten et al., 1996) .",

            "text": "virulence for piglets (Y. . Obviously, the Nsp9 is the most important protein contributing to the replication and virulence of PRRSV. To date, limited evidence is known about the roles of Nsp9 in the regulation of PRRSV replication. A recent literature indicated that the interaction of Nsp9 with endogenous cellular annexin A2 is beneficial for PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells (J. . Our latest work showed that the interaction of Nsp9 with cellular retinoblastoma protein (pRb) contributes the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV in vitro (Dong et al., 2014) . Therefore, further exploring the interaction of Nsp9 with host cellular proteins is necessary for fully understanding the mechanisms associated with the replication regulation and pathogenesis of PRRSV. The DEAD-box RNA helicases belonging to superfamily 2 of cellular RNA helicases have been shown to be essential for different processes of RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA processing, RNA decay, mRNA export, translation initiation and transcription regulation (Li et al., 2013; Linder and Fuller-Pace, 2013; Mazurek et al., 2012) . These proteins share eight conserved motifs (I, Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V and VI) in the DExD/H helicase family (Choi and Lee, 2012; Zonta et al., 2013) , which are considered to be involved in RNA binding and decay, ATP binding and hydrolysis. The DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 (DDX5) has been shown to affect viral RNA replication by interacting with viral helicase in hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Goh et al., 2004) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ). In the present study, we described the interaction of DDX5 with the Nsp9 of the Chinese HP-PRRSV and analyzed the role of this interaction in regulating viral replication in vitro.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that DDX5 could interact with the core protein, NS3 and NS5 of Japanese B encephalitis virus (JEV) during viral infection. Since NS3 and NS5 of JEV can bind to 3 UTR of viral RNA that may be involved in the first round of viral protein translation and RNA replication, further research indicated that DDX5 binds to the JEV 3 UTR to enhance viral replication but not viral protein translation (Li et al., 2013) . Thus, we propose that the interaction between DDX5 and Nsp9 might regulate the replication of PRRSV via forming a complex binding to the 3 UTR of viral genome, which needs to be further confirmed.",

            "text": "The interaction of viral proteins with host cellular proteins and the subsequent re-localization of those cellular proteins may play important roles in regulating the viral life cycle, especially in the replication of viruses. The endogenous DDX1 interacting with the Nsp14 of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has been found to be relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in virus-infected cells (Xu et al., 2010) . Our results showed that DDX5 co-localized with Nsp9 in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear pattern in HEK293 cells, MARC-145 cells and PAM cell line, and meanwhile it co-localized with Nsp9 in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and PAMs, suggesting that endogenous DDX5 might diffuse from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. These finding lead us to postulate that cellular DDX5 with helicase activity might help to unwind the viral RNA to make the RdRp transcribe the RNA more efficiently during the PRRSV infection.",

Our results indicated that silencing of DDX5 expression in MARC-145 cells could inhibit significantly the replication of PRRSV, and while the over-expression of DDX5 in MARC-145 cells displayed an enhancement effect on the replication of PRRSV, suggesting that DDX5 might function as a cellular cofactor that positively regulates the PRRSV replication. The exact mechanism concerning this role, however, needs to be further explored. Recent studies have revealed that DDX1 and DDX3 are co-factors of HIV Rev protein to export HIV-1 transcripts (Edgcomb et al., 2012; Robertson-Anderson et al., 2011; Yasuda-Inoue et al., 2013) . DDX5, as a new cellular co-factor of Rev protein, is shown to be beneficial for HIV-1 replication (Zhou et al., 2013) . Thus, the recruitment of DDX5 by Nsp9 would have important significances for understanding the genomic replication and transcription of PRRSV. Further study on this issue will help to reveal new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV replication.",

The cells were examined at 48 h post-transfection by Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay. (C) PRRSV titers in the supernatants of DDX5 gene-silenced MARC-145 cells. MARC-145 cells were transfected with Sus-147 or control siRNA at a final concentration of 30 pmol, and were then infected at 48 h post-transfection with PRRSV JXwn06 at MOI of 0.01. Normal MARC-145 cells were also infected with the virus as a control. The virus titers in the supernatants were assayed at the indicated time points. Data are shown as means + SD of three independent experiments (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ns, no significant).",
