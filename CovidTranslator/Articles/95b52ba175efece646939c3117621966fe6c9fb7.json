            "text": "We tested the hypothesis that the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses for respiratory viruses would reduce antibiotic treatment and length of stay in elderly patients hospitalized with respiratory infections. Within 24 h of hospital admission, a total of 922 patients aged \u226560 years were interviewed for symptoms of ongoing respiratory tract infection. Symptomatic patients were swabbed for oropharyngeal/ nasopharyngeal presence of viral pathogens immediately by members of the study group. During a 2-month period, nonsymptomatic volunteers among interviewed patients were swabbed as well (controls). Oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed with real-time PCR for nine common respiratory viruses. A total of 147 out of 173 symptomatic patients and 56 non-symptomatic patients (controls) agreed to participate in the study. The patients were allocated to three cohorts: (1) symptomatic and PCR-positive (S/PCR+), (2) symptomatic and PCR-negative (S/PCR\u2212), or (3) nonsymptomatic and PCR-negative (control). There were no nonsymptomatic patients with a positive PCR result. A nonsignificant difference in the frequency of empiric antibiotic administration was found when comparing the S/PCR+ to the S/PCR\u2212 cohort; 16/19 (84 %) vs. 99/128 (77 %) (\u03c7 2 =0.49). Antibiotic treatment was withdrawn in only two patients in the S/PCR+ cohort after receiving a positive viral diagnosis. The length of stay did not significantly differ between the S/PCR+ and the S/PCR\u2212 groups. We conclude that, at least in our general hospital setting, access to early viral diagnosis by real-time PCR had little impact on the antimicrobial treatment or length of hospitalization of elderly patients.",

Apart from the sensitivity and specificity of the involved laboratory methods, successful etiological diagnosis of RVIs depends on virus-specific factors such as the extent of shedding, as well as on the patient's age and medical condition [10] [11] [12] . Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays can provide a rapid etiological diagnosis more efficiently than conventional microbiological methods [13] . Therefore, real-time PCR may contribute to reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics and to shortening the length of hospitalization. The high diagnostic sensitivity of real-time PCR may be of special value in viral respiratory infections of the elderly, who, at least in the case of RSV, are characterized by low mucosal shedding of the virus [9, 14] .",

These results are comparable to other studies, where antibiotics were discontinued in 9.1-28.6 % of the patients after receiving a positive rapid viral test [6, 17, 24] . The impact of rapid viral screening on antibiotic administration in children is not easily transferable to the elderly. First, a negative result of PCR in elderly adults is less reliable due to the reduced viral shedding in this age group [9] . Second, even with a positive viral PCR result, there is an understandable reluctance to discontinue antibiotic treatment in the elderly, as immunosenescence and comorbidities render these patients at increased risk for a bacterial co-infection [25] . Unfortunately, the elderly may be particularly vulnerable to the consequences of inappropriate use of antibiotics, such as adverse drug events, super-infection by Clostridium difficile, and, ultimately, selection of resistant bacteria [26] . Due to their reduced physiological reserves, residents in long-term care facilities seem to be at particular risk in this regard [27, 28] .",

In the present study, a tentative pneumonia diagnosis at admission was confirmed by chest Xray in only half of the patient population. In one study, a local educational program for the treatment of respiratory infections in the elderly significantly reduced the prescription rate and influenced the types of antibiotics prescribed [29] , thus indicating the effectiveness of age-adjusted guidelines of antibiotic treatment also in elderly patients.",

In addition, the low number of specially trained staff harvesting the viral samples minimized the risk of poor-quality samples. A limitation to this study is the low number of patients with positive viral swabs. Economical considerations prohibited PCR analysis for rhinovirus and coronavirus; an inclusion of these viruses in the PCR panel could have improved the number of virus-positive swabs.
