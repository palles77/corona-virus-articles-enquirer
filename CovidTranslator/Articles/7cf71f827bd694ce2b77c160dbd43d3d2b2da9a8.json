All 31 serotypes of ECHO viruses grew in HT-29, 27 and SKCO-1.5 in HRT-18, 29 in PMK and 29 in RD. There was good growth of poliovirus serotypes in all five cell types. Coxsackie B viruses grew well in all the cell lines except RD. Fifteen of the Coxsackie A viruses grew in SKCO-I,4 in HT-29,3 in HRT-18 and 7 in RD. Enterovirus serotypes 70 and 71 grew only in RD cells after 3 serial passages. These results showed that 2 of the gut tumour-derived cell lines, HT-29 and SKCO-I had a markedly wider susceptibility, with comparable or wider sensitivity, for enteroviruses, than PMK and RD.

Primate epithelial cell strains and lines and suckling mice are widely used for the isolation of enteroviruses from clinical samples and their subsequent identification, since it is well recognised that no single cell culture system is ideal (Wenner, 1972; Grist et al., 1979) . A search for continuous cell lines to grow enteroviruses identified RD cells from human thabdomyosarcoma and BGM cells from African green monkey kidney as possible useful lines (Dahling et al., 1974; Davies and Phillpotts, 1974; Schmidt et al., 1975, and 1978; Wecker and Ter Meulen, 1977) . We found that a variety of enteroviruses grew from faecal samples inoculated into HRT-18, a continuous differentiated epithelial cell line derived from human rectal carcinoma (Tompkins et al., 1978) , during attempts to isolate coronavirus-like particles, widely prevalent in human faeces in southern India (Mathan et al., 1975; Pate1 et al., 1984) . This paper reports a systematic study, comparing primary monkey kidney and RD cells with HRT-18 and two other gut tumour-derived differentiated epithelial cell lines, SKCO-1 and HT-29 (Fogh and Trempe, 1975) , using 66 prototype strains of enteroviruses.",

Fifteen of the 24 mouse brain grown Coxsackie-A viruses also grew to high titres in SKCO-I and their growth was much better than in RD cells in which several of these viruses are reported to grow well (Schmidt et al., 1975) .",

However, the use of these cells for the field isolation of enteroviruses has to be established. In preliminary studies, 34 CPE producing agents (ECHO 7-6, ECHO 30-4, Polio 2-8, Coxsackie B6-2 and untyped 14) were isolated from 72 stool samples obtained from 39 individuals belonging to ten families from a village affected by an epidemic of diarrhoea (unpubl. data). These results are suggestive that in the field isolation of enteroviruses SKCO-1 and HT-29 cells is likely to be as useful as it has been shown to be for various laboratory procedures in the present study. A large number of intestinal neoplasm-derived continuous epithelial cell lines are now available (Fogh et al., 1977) and it would appear profitable to investigate them to detect cells which may support growth of a wider variety of enteroviruses.",
