This study addressed whether the gastrointestinal tract might be another latency site. To test this hypothesis, we prospectively quantified fecal BKV by quantitative PCR reaction in 40 patients undergoing hematopoietic SCT (HSCT). Urinary BKV was similarly quantified. Fecal BKV excretion was positive in 16/40 patients, of whom 10 were transient (o3 consecutively positive samples), six were persistent (X3 consecutively positive samples) and three were persistent with peaking (X10 3 -fold increase in viral load over baseline, reaching 5.11 \u00c2 10 6 , 4.68 \u00c2 10 7 and 2.75 \u00c2 10 8 copies/sample at 14, 14 and 21 days post-HSCT, respectively). Urinary BKV excretion was positive in 25/40 patients. Fecal BKV excretion was significantly correlated with that of the urine (P \u00bc 0.036) and was significantly associated with allogeneic HSCT (P \u00bc 0.037) and persistent and peaking of urinary BKV excretion (Po0.001). Binary logistic regression showed that BKV viruria was the only significant risk factor for fecal BKV excretion (P \u00bc 0.021). Fecal BKV excretion occurred in 40% patients undergoing HSCT, implicating the gastrointestinal tract as a BKV latency site.",

This is the first prospective and quantitative analysis of fecal BKV load during HSCT. We showed positive fecal BKV excretion in 16 of 40 HSCT patients. Our protocol of fecal viral quantification has been validated for coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome. 7 A significant peaking in fecal BKV excretion was detected in 3/40 patients (pattern a cases), which showed a consistent pattern of increase, peaking and decline. It paralleled concomitant urinary BKV reactivation, with peaks coinciding on the same days. In fact, all three patients had undergone allogeneic HSCT and developed GVHD, which were typical risk factors for urinary BKV reactivation. 3, 6, 8 Therefore, fecal and urinary BKV excretions probably reflected viral reactivation consequent to severe immunosuppression. Definitive proof of BKV reactivation from the gastrointestinal tract would require detection of BKV viral antigen in colonic tissues, direct demonstration of viral particles in stool by electron microscopy or detection of BKV DNA in the gastrointestinal tract by in situ hybridization in the absence of late gene expression in seropositive patients.

Our findings offered much more rigorous results and provided kinetic data that were more meaningful and robust that isolated measurements. Indeed, the increase and decline of fecal BKV load is typical of what might be expected of in reactivation of latent viruses after organ transplantation. 13 Although the proposition of the gastrointestinal tract as a BKV latency site would need further validation in patients and normal people, it may provide valuable insights into BKV epidemiology. The seroprevalence of BKV increases from about 50% in children to 70-90% in adults. 14 The high BKV seroprevalence has never been adequately explained, assuming urine to be the only means of transmission. A fecal-oral route, however, offers an additional epidemiologic explanation for the high viral prevalence.",

In this study, however, we were unable to observe any apparent association between fecal BKV excretion and gut GVHD.

This was lower than that of 40% reported from stool and rectal swab samples in hospitalized children, based on the detection of the BKV T-antigen gene. 5 Whether this reflects an age-related difference in BKV fecal excretion and hence differences in viral epidemiology in health and disease or a technical difference in BKV DNA detection remains to be determined.",
