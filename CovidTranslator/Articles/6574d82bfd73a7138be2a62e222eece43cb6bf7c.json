Anti-BoNT antibodies have been described that are capable of detecting BoNTs; however there still exists a need for accurate and sensitive detection capabilities for BoNTs. Herein, we describe the characterization of a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) generated to the non-toxic receptor-binding domain of BoNT/ A (H C 50/A) developed using a high-throughput screening approach. In two independent hybridoma fusions, two groups of four IgG MAbs were developed against recombinant H C 50/A. Of these eight, only a single MAb, F90G5-3, bound to the whole BoNT/A protein and was characterized further. The F90G5-3 MAb slightly prolonged time to death in an in vivo mouse bioassay and was mapped by pepscan to a peptide epitope in the Nterminal subdomain of H C 50/A (H CN 25/A) comprising amino acid residues 985 WTLQDTQEIKQRVVF 999 , an epitope that is highly immunoreactive in humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that F90G5-3 binds BoNT/A with nanomolar efficiency. Together, our results indicate that F90G5-3 is of potential value as a diagnostic immunoreagent for BoNT/A capture assay development and bio-forensic analysis.",

            "text": "T he botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) exist as seven distinct serotypes (A-G) and are the causative agents of botulism, a neuroparalytic disease. BoNTs are among the most toxic substances known with an estimated human lethal dose of 1 ng/kg body weight. (1) Naturally occurring botulism transpires from the ingestion of contaminated food or the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by BoNT-producing clostridia. However, the relative ease of production and the lethality of all the BoNT subtypes has resulted in their inclusion on the Category A Select Agents and Toxins list. (1) Furthermore, mass vaccination against BoNTs is unlikely due to the rarity of the naturally occurring disease, the limited availability and crudeness of the current pentavalent vaccine, and the subsequent inability to use BoNT therapy in vaccines. (1) Neutralizing antibodies have been observed to be protective against toxin challenge. Indeed, polyclonal therapies against BoNT include human immunoglobulin for infant botulism (BoNT serotypes A and B) and equine immunoglobulin for adult botulism (BoNT serotypes A, B, and E). (1, 2) In addition, a despeciated investigational heptavalent antitoxin (HBAT), which contains antibodies to all seven known BoNT serotypes, has recently become available to treat adult botulism. (3) (4) (5) The potential severity and lethality of botulism poisoning require that a patient presenting clinical symptoms receive antitoxin in a timely manner, before receiving a definitive diagnosis. (2, 6, 7) To date, the gold standard to detect BoNT in clinical samples is the mouse toxicity assay. While both sensitive and specific, this assay takes up to 96 h to complete and requires specialized personnel, facility, and reagent resources. (8) Due to adverse patient reactions that can occur and batch variation in polyclonal immunoglobulin production, it is desirable to develop rapid methods of diagnosis that permit accurate and sensitive BoNT detection and serotyping capability to ensure the correct course of treatment is initiated as soon as possible. Many efforts have been made to develop alternative, immunologically based assays for BoNT detection in clinical samples, yet these assays are often limited by the availability of high-quality antibodies. (8) The production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against BoNTs is an excellent choice for several reasons. First, MAbs are consistent between lots. Second, they are well defined and are theoretically in unlimited supply. Mammalian cell lines scale up readily and provide a means to produce clinical grade material. Third, murine hybridomas with bioactivity provide good lead molecules that can be modified by recombinant means for improved bioactivity and/or less immunogenicity, the latter, for example, by simple chimerization strategies.",

            "text": "Investigation of BoNT structures has provided invaluable information for alternative strategies for antibody development to the BoNTs. All known BoNTs are synthesized as inactive *150 kDa pretoxins composed of three *50 kDa functional domains. Upon secretion, the pretoxin is cleaved by proteases into an active disulfide bond-linked dipeptide consisting of a *50 kDa light chain and a *100 kDa heavy chain. The light chain contains the N-terminal catalytic domain, while the heavy chain comprises a *50 kDa translocation domain (H N 50) and a *50 kDa C-terminal receptorbinding domain (H C 50). The catalytic domain on the light chain is a zinc-endopeptidase that cleaves target SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) complex proteins at the neuromuscular junction, preventing neurotransmitter release. The H C 50 domain contains the receptor-binding site that targets the BoNTs to cholinorogenic nerve endings where the toxin is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the H N 50 translocation domain aids in the intracellular translocation of the enzymatically active light chain into the host cell cytosol. (9) (10) (11) This H C 50 binding domain (corresponding to residues 873-1295 of BoNT/A) can be further divided into two *25 kDa subdomains: the N-terminal b-barrel (H CN 25 subdomain) and the C-terminal b-trefoil fold (H CC 25 subdomain). (11, 12) BoNTs are proposed to bind to host cell neurons via a two-receptor mechanism, whereas BoNT/A binds to host cell gangliosides followed by specific binding to the glycoprotein receptor SV2 within the synaptic vesicles. (13) (14) (15) The conserved motif H.SXWY.G for ganglioside binding is located within H CC 25 of BoNT/A and BoNT/B. (11, 16, 17) While the specific amino acids for BoNT/A receptor binding have yet to be elucidated, the BoNT/B receptor-binding site is located within its H CC 25 subdomain, and it is most likely this region that provides the BoNT/A protein receptor site as well. (14, 18) Immunization with the inert H C 50 domains of BoNTs provides a safe and rational approach for MAb development toward BoNTs.",

There have also been reports of murine MAbs, developed using classical hybridoma technology, which neutralize BoNT/A with high potency.

All of the MAbs, except F90G5-3 (IgG2a/k), were of the IgG1/k isotype. Assessment of the BoNT/A reactivity revealed only one MAb, F90G5-3, had strong reactivity with whole BoNT/A neurotoxin, and was therefore chosen for further characterization (Fig. 1) . The specificity and reactivity of MAb F90G5-3 were assessed against the H C 50 domains of BoNT/A, BoNT/B, BoNT/E, (32) subdomains, H CN 25/A and H CC 25/A ( Fig. 2A and C) . As we demonstrated previously in a high-throughput method development study, F90G5-3 has excellent serotype specificity for H C 50/A domain with no observed cross-reactivity with H C 50/B or H C 50/E.

One can observe slight reactivity in the Pepscan (Fig. 3A) with a second peptide corresponding to amino acids 1195 TNASQAGVEKILSAL 1209. Given that F90G5-3 is a monoclonal antibody, this reactivity is most likely due to cross-reactivity with similar amino acid residues and thus an artefact of the in vitro pepscan assay, as this sequence is located within H C 25/A sub-region of BoNT/A with which F90G5-3 does not specifically react (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, comparison of the primary amino acid sequence in the region corresponding to the 985 WTLQDTQEIKQRVVF 999 epitope in BoNT/A to BoNT/B and BoNT/E reveals that five of 15 residues are identical between all three toxins, whereas paired comparison of BoNT/A with BoNT/B or BoNT/E shows only two of 15 and one of 15 are conserved and semi-conserved between all three BoNTs, respectively (Fig. 3B) . Indeed, only six residues are unique within this region in BoNT/A, indicating that BoNT/A residues TQE-K-R are critical for F90G5-3 binding and strongly suggesting that this region is under intense immune or environmental selection pressure.",

This partially neutralizing epitope lies within the H CN 25/A subdomain of H C 50/ A, a region with greater primary sequence homology in comparison to the H CC 25 subdomain, which is more antigenic and important for host cell ganglioside binding. (11, 16, 39) In the schematic representation of BoNT/A, one can observe the residues important for host cell ganglioside receptor binding are located on an adjacent surface to the F90G5-3 epitope (Fig. 3C , orange space fill). The interaction with the host cell gangliosides is the first low affinity binding interaction that brings the toxin in close proximity to the host cells in the dual receptor model of binding. (15) Antibody bound to the F90G5-3 epitope (Fig. 3C , red space fill) may cause steric hindrance to partially occlude the ganglioside-binding site and thus provide an explanation for the delayed time to death observed within this study. While the amino acid residues that interact with the host cell protein receptor have yet to be clearly elucidated, Garcia-Rodriguez and colleagues have recently co-crystallized neutralizing antibody fragments (CR1 and AR2) with BoNT/ A, thus identifying critical contact residues for neutralization. (40) The amino acid residues of BoNT/A identified as the structural binding epitope of neutralizing CR1 are depicted in the pink color space fill, and the residues identified as part of the functional epitopes of both neutralizing MAbs CR1 and AR2 are depicted in the cyan space fill (Fig. 3C) . (40) In this schematic, it does not appear that the epitope bound by MAb F90G5-3 interferes with these key neutralizing residues.",

A search of the Immune Epitope Database (www.immuneepitope .org) reveals that this minimal epitope has been targeted by antibody responses from other species as a part of longer contiguous regions. Indeed, the epitope has been studied through peptide mapping of polyclonal immune serum raised to the BoNT/A toxin in multiple species. (41) Using a radioimmunoassay, the C10 peptide (BoNT/A residues 981-999) was found to be immunodominant in humans and chickens but recessive in equine and outbred mice. Intriguingly, sera from 24 of 28 cervical dystonia patients treated with BONT/A contained neutralizing antibodies that bound the C10 epitope (residues 981-999). (42) The hybridoma F90G5-3 may thus be a rare clone or the polyclonal response in inbred mice may not mirror that observed by Attasi and Dolimbek. (41) While other studies have evaluated the immunogenicity of this discrete region as a part of larger polypeptides, the immunogenicity of this minimal target remains unknown and needs investigation given the empirical nature of protein immunogens. Nevertheless, these data reveal the first minimal MAb epitope 985 WTLQDTQEIKQRVVF 999 to map to this small domain for F90G5-3. Importantly, our findings that MAb F90G5-3 binds to a specific epitope region of BoNT/A with high affinity and that this epitope target is highly immunoreactive in humans indicates that F90G5-3 is of potential value as a diagnostic immunoreagent for BoNT/A capture assay development and bioforensic analysis.",

            "text": "Cloning, expression, and purification of BoNT/A H C 50 subdomains H CN 25/A and H CC 25/A Gene segments encoding the N-terminal half (H CN 25/A; aa 865-1100) and the C-terminal half (H CC 25/A; aa 1077-1296) of the BoNT/A H C 50 receptor-binding domain (strain 62A; aa 865-1296, accession no. M30196) were cloned into the vector pET30 a + (Novagen, San Diego, CA), yielding expression plasmids pETHn25A and pETHc25A, respectively. Expression was conducted for 12 h at 20\u00b0C in Escherichia coli BL21codon plus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX), grown in Terrific Broth (1.2% peptone, 2.4% yeast extract, 0.94% K 2 HPO 4 , 0.22% KH 2 PO 4 ; Difco, Sparks, MD), by the addition of 0.5 mM final concentration of IPTG. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in bacterial protein extract reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) containing 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.01 mg/mL DNase (Sigma), and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The cell suspension was passed twice through a French pressure cell (Thermo Scientific, Ottawa, Canada). A 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 0.1% b-Octyl D-glucopyranoside (b-OG, pH 8.0) was added to the lysed cell suspension and allowed to stand for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 27,000 g for 40 min to remove the precipitate. H CN 25/A or H CC 25/A were purified from the clarified supernatant by Ni-NTA chromatography (Superflow column, Qiagen, Toronto, Canada). The recombinant proteins were eluted using an imidazole gradient (20-250 mM imidazole in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 300 mM NaCl and 0.1% b-OG [pH 8.0]). The active fractions (which eluted with *80 mM imidazole) were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mM sodium phosphate with 0.1% b-OG (pH 6.8). The dialysate was centrifuged at 27,000 g for 30 min to remove the precipitate. This clear supernatant was loaded onto a cation-exchange column containing 4 mL of CM Sepharose Fast Flow (GE-Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated with 25 mM sodium phosphate with 0.1% b OG (pH 6.8). The column was washed with 50 volumes of 25 mM sodium phosphate with 0.1% b OG (pH 6.8). Bound protein was eluted from the column with an NaCl gradient (5-500 mM NaCl in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 0.1% b OG [pH 6.8]). The active fractions, which eluted with *200 mM NaCl, were pooled and dialyzed against PBS with 504CORBETT ET AL.",
