An immuno-36 informatics approach along with comparative genomic was applied to design a multi-epitope-37 based peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 combining the antigenic epitopes of the S, M and E 38 proteins. The tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated using advanced 39 bioinformatics tools. The candidate vaccine showed an average of \u2265 90.0% world population 40 coverage for different ethnic groups. Molecular docking of the chimeric vaccine peptide with the 41 immune receptors (TLR3 and TLR4) predicted efficient binding. Immune simulation predicted 42 significant primary immune response with increased IgM and secondary immune response with 43 high levels of both IgG1 and IgG2. It also increased the proliferation of T-helper cells and 44 cytotoxic T-cells along with the increased INF-\u03b3 and IL-2 cytokines. The codon optimization and 45 mRNA secondary structure prediction revealed the chimera is suitable for high-level expression 46 and cloning. Overall, the constructed recombinant chimeric vaccine candidate demonstrated 47 significant potential and can be considered for clinical validation to fight against this global 48 threat, COVID-19. 49 50 51 52 53",

Alternatively, we propose the development 118 of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate which could lead to the generation of a more potent 119 protective immune response. Multi-epitope vaccine candidates have already been designed for 120 several diseases, including FMD (in our laboratory; unpublished data), MERS and SARS, and 121 their efficacies have been further reported in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV 2,6,22 . Hence, we can 122 assume that chimeric vaccine targeting multiple epitopes on the RBD and NTD segments of the 123 S protein, M and E proteins would be a potentially effective vaccine candidate in combatting 124 SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, could be used for vaccine design. Combining subunit vaccines with 125 (II) of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were 33.01, 32.42 and 36.60 148 indicating that these proteins are quite stable 4,23 . 149 The S protein of the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is a trimeric 150 conformation consisting of three homologous chains naming as chain A, B and C 5,10 (Fig. 1). The 151 individual structural domain of coronavirus S proteins reflects high degree of structural 152 divergences in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the chain A 153 and chain C compared to that of chain B. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the S 154 protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares 77.38% and 31.93% sequence identity with the S proteins of the 155 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and these findings are in line with many earlier 156 studies 3-7 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Due to structural divergence in RBD and NTD of S proteins in 157 SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, these regions are the main focus of structural 158 studies including epitope-based chimeric vaccine candidate designing, selection, and 159 development. 160 161",

Therefore, this work focused on the in silico design and 435 development of a potential multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 selecting epitopes and 436 domains from the S, E and M proteins. 437 Among the structural elements of CoVs, the spike S glycoproteins are composed of two 438 major domains, the RBD and NTD. Furthermore, the homotrimeric S proteins of the SARS-439 CoV-2, SARS-CoV 9,10 and MERS-CoV 5 comprises three chains: the chain A, B and C on the 440 viral surface, guiding the link to host receptors. Unlike the full-length S protein of the CoVs, the 441 RBD and NTD segments possessed the critical neutralizing domains but lacking the non-442 neutralizing immunodominant region 6,10,11,22 .

Strikingly, the multi-epitope peptide we designed and 484 constructed (CoV-RMEN), showed higher antigenicity scores on Vaxijen v2.0 (0.450 with a 485 virus model at a threshold of 0.4) and ANTIGENpro (0.875) gave an antigenic score almost 486 twice that of Ov-103 on ANTIGENpro (0.93 for the chimeric peptide and 0.59 for Ov-103) 487 supporting that this multiple-epitopes carrying vaccine candidate would be poorly immunogenic 488 and require coupling to adjuvants. However, the designed protein must show similar antigenicity 489 scores with and without the addition of an adjuvant sequence 21 . 490 It has been reported that immunity to viral infections is dependent on both B-and T-491 cells 20,21 . Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) recognize Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns 492 PAMPs) from viral components or replication intermediates, resulting in signaling cascades that 493 initiate an antiviral state in cells as a result of infection 41 . However, it is likely that TLRs might 494 play an important role in the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection 42 . Though, we 495 did not use any adjuvants, it is reported that TLRs (TLR3 and TLR4) can effectively bind with 496 spike protein of the CoV 43 . The molecular docking analysis of the CoV-RMEN through 497 HADDOCK showed that the chimeric protein can establish stable protein-protein interactions 498 with TLRs (TLR-3,TLR-4) 41 indicating efficient activation of these surface molecules which is 499 very crucial for immune activation of dendritic cells for subsequent antigen processing and 500 presentation to CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells via MHC-II and MHC-1, respectively corroborating the 501 findings of different earlier studies 11,20,21 . TLR 4 might bind to S protein leading to the 502 activation of the MyD88 dependent signaling pathway, which ultimately releases 503 proinflammatory cytokines 35 . Immune simulation of the designed CoV-RMEN showed results 504 consistent with typical immune responses, and there was a general increase in the generated 505 immune responses after repeated antigen exposures. The comprehensive immune response 506 developed after repeated antigen exposure reflected a perfect host defence development with the 507 uplifted primary immune response and subsequent secondary immune response resulting in 508 immune memory development 2 . In the present study, the development of memory B-cells and T-509 cells was evident, with memory in B-cells lasting for several months. Helper T-cells were 510 particularly stimulated. The engrossing findings of the study is the development of Th1 response 511 which enhance the growth and proliferation of B-cells augmenting the adaptive immunity 44 . The 512 antiviral cytokine IFN-\u03b3 and cell stimulatory IL-2 level significantly increased which also 513 contribute to the subsequent immune response after vaccination in host 2 . This indicates high 514 levels of helper T-cells and consequently efficient antibody production, 45 . The Simpson index, D for investigation of clonal specificity suggests a possible 516 diverse immune response. This is plausible considering the generated chimeric peptide is 517 composed of sufficient B-and T-cell epitopes. 518 One of the first steps in validating a candidate vaccine is to screen for immunoreactivity 519 through serological analysis. This requires the expression of the recombinant protein in a suitable 520 host. Escherichia coli expression systems are the preferred choice for the production of 521 recombinant proteins 33 . In order to achieve high-level expression of our recombinant vaccine 522 protein in E. coli (strain K12), codon optimization was carried out. Stable mRNA structure, 523 codon adaptability index (0.87), and the GC content (50.26%) were favourable for high-level 524 expression of the protein in bacteria. The next step projected at the moment, is to express this 525 peptide in a bacterial system and perform the various immunological assays needed to validate 526 the results obtained here through immuno-informatics analyses. 527 528 Conclusions 529 COVID-19 is reaching entire globe and emergence of the causative agent SARS-CoV-2 530kept us nowhere as we are racing for treatment and prevention. This multi-epitope chimera that 531 we named as CoV-RMEN possess domains of RBD and NTD segments of S, M and E proteins 532 all of which showed significant antigenic properties compared to any other viral proteins. This 533 chimera also includes potential CTL, HTL and B-cell epitopes to ensure humoral as well as 534 cellular immune response and the optimal expression and stability of the chimera was validated. 535With multiple limitations and high cost requirements for the attenuated vaccine preparation for 536 contagious agents like SARS-CoV-2, this chimeric peptide vaccine candidate gives us the hope 537 to ensure it's availability and relatively cheap option to reach entire world.

The predicted T-cell 614 epitopes were shortlisted based on the aligned Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with half-615 maximal inhibitory concentration (annIC 50 ) values up to 50 nM. The IEDB \"Population 616Coverage\" tool (http://tools.iedb.org/population/) 57 was used to determine the world human 617 population coverage by the shortlisted CTL and HTL epitopes. We used multi-epitopes involving 618 both CTL and HTL epitopes to have the higher probability of larger human population coverage 619 worldwide. We used OmicsCircos to visualize the association between world population and 620 different ethnic groups 58 . 621622IFN-\u03b3-inducing epitope prediction 623Potential IFN-\u03b3 epitopes of all the selected antigenic sites of RBD, NTD, envelop protein 624 B-cell epitope (EBE), and membrane protein B-cell epitope (MBE) were predicted by 625 \"IFNepitope\" server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ ifnepitope/scan.php). To identify the set of 626 epitopes associated with MHC alleles that would maximize the population coverage, we adopted627 the \"Motif and SVM hybrid\" (MERCI: Motif-EmeRging and with Classes-Identification, and 628 SVM) approach. The tool generates overlapping sequences from the query antigens for IFN-\u03b3-629 inducing epitope prediction. The estimated population coverage represents the percentage of 630 the population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one T 631 cell epitope from the set, and finally the coverage was observed by adding epitopes associated 632 with any of the remaining MHC alleles 2 . The prediction is based on a dataset of IFN-\u03b3-inducing 633 and IFN-\u03b3-noninducing MHC allele binders 59 . 634 635 Design and construction of multi-epitope vaccine candidate 636 The candidate vaccine design and construction method follows previously developed 637 FMD peptide vaccine development protocol in Professor M Anwar Hossain's laboratory 638 (unpublished data, and under patent application in Bangladesh Application No. 639 P/BD/2018/000280, date: October 1, 2018; India Patent Number: 201924036919, Date: 640 September 13, 2019). The multi-epitope protein was constructed by positioning the selected 641 RBD, NTD, MBE and EBE amino acid sequences linked with short, rigid and flexible linkers 642 GG. To develop highly immunogenic recombinant proteins, two universal T-cell epitopes were 643 used, namely, a pan-human leukocyte antigen DR-binding peptide (PADRE) 60 , and an invasin 644 immunostimulatory sequence taken from Yersinia (Invasin) 61 were used to the N and C terminal 645 of the vaccine construct respectively, linked with EGGE. Here, acidic aa, Glutamate (E) was 646 added to balance the ratio of acidic and basic amino acids. We denoted the vaccine candidate as 647 CoV-RMEN. VaxiJen 2.0 52 and ANTIGENpro (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/) web-648 servers were used to predict the antigenicity of the CoV-RMEN while the AllerTOP 2.0 649 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP) and AllergenFP (http://ddg-pharmfac.net/AllergenFP/) 650 web-servers were used to predict vaccine allergenicity. 651 652 Physiochemical properties and solubility prediction of the CoV-parameters of the CoV-RMEN were assessed using the online 654 web-server ProtParam 50 . These parameters included aa residue composition, theoretical pI, 655 instability index, in vitro and in vivo half-life, aliphatic index, molecular weight, and grand 656 average of hydropathicity (GRAVY). The solubility of the multi-epitope vaccine peptide was 657 evaluated using the Protein-Sol server (https://protein-sol.manchester.ac.uk///www.biogem.org/tool/chou-fasman/) and RaptorX Property 662 (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/StructurePropertyPred/predict/) 62 , web-servers were used for 663 secondary structure predictions. The RaptorX web-server (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/) 62 was 664 used to predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure and binding residues of the chosen protein. 665 Homology modelling of the CoV-RMEN was carried out using the protein homology/analogy 666 recognition engine (Phyre2) (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index) web-667 server. 668 669 Refinement and validation of the tertiary structure of the CoV-RMEN 670The 3D model obtained for the CoV-RMEN was refined in a three-step process, initially 671 energy minimization using the GROMOS96 program 27 implemented within the Swiss-672PdbViewer (version 4.1.0) 47 .

Molecular docking of the CoV-RMEN with the TLR3 (PDB ID: 1ZIW) and TLR4 701 (PDB ID: 4G8A) receptor was performed using the High Ambiguity Driven DOCKing 702 (HADDOCK, version 2.4) 65 web-server in order to evaluate the interaction between ligand and 703 receptor and consequently the development of an immune response. In order to predict such 704 interaction, data-driven docking of designed chimeric protein and TLR3 and TLR4 complexes 705 were performed 33 . In this regard, CPORT (https://milou.science.uu.nl/services/CPORT/) was 706 used to predict active interface residues of the CoV-RMEN and TLRs. The HADDOCK server 707 was then employed to perform docking simulations of the CoV-RMEN-TLRs complexes due to 708 perform short MD simulations of docked complexes 56 . Finally, the binding affinities of the top-709 ranking docking pose of chimeric protein-TLRs complexes was predicted using the PRODIGY 710 (PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction) (https://nestor.science.uu.nl/prodigy/) web-server 56 . 711 712Analysis of cDNA and mRNA for cloning and expression 713Reverse translation and codon optimization were performed using the GenScript Rare 714Codon Analysis Tool (https://www.genscript.com/tools/rare-codon-analysis) in order to express 715 the CoV-RMEN in a selected expression vector. Codon optimization was performed in order to 716 express the final vaccine construct in the E. coli (strain K12). The analysis output includes the 717 codon adaptation index (CAI) and percentage GC content, which can be used to assess protein 718 expression levels. CAI provides information on codon usage biases; the ideal CAI score is 1.0 719 but >0.8 is considered a good score 66 . The GC content of a sequence should range between 30-720 70%. GC content values outside this range suggest unfavorable effects on translational and 721 22 . Stability of the mRNA was measured using two different tools 722 namely RNAfold (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi) and the mfold 723(http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold) web-servers.
