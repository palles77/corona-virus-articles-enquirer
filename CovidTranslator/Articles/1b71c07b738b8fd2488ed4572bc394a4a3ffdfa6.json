Hand nets in roosts or mist nets of different length and height near maternity roosts were used as described in Pfefferle et al. [4] .

Briefly, RNA was extracted from the samples by using the Nucleospin RNA II kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and analyzed for the presence of CoV RNA using OneStep-PCR protocol. Twenty five microliter of reactions was carried out using the SuperScript \u00d2 III one step RT-PCR system with Platinum \u00d2 Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen TM code 12574-026) with 2 lM of sense and anti-sense primer, 1 ll of enzyme mix, 10 U of RNasin \u00d2 Plus RNase inhibitor (Promega code N2611), and 5 ll of RNA. Thermal cycling was set at 55\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 94\u00b0C for 2 min and then 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, 68\u00b0C for 40 s, and final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5 min. The nested PCR protocol, unmodified from Souza et al. [5] , used 1 ll of first round PCR product. Two novel CoVs belonging to the genera alpha-and betaCoV were detected in M. blythii (ITA31/384/2012) and E. serotinus specimens (ITA26/384/2012) (GenBank accession numbers: KF312400 and KF312399), respectively. ITA31/384/2012 was detected in a mixed Myotis roost in a church roof in the Bolzano province and ITA26/ 384/2012 in a single species roost in a primary school in Lombardia (Fig. 1) . The @ 400 bp CoV RdRp fragment was further extended to 816 bp as described by Drexler et al. [6] to allow for a more reliable taxonomic classification of the detected betaCoV. The ITA26/384/2012 amino acid sequence in the translated 816-bp fragment was 96.9 % similar to the MERS-CoV (Genbank accession number KF192507) and allowed the classification of the Italian virus as a lineage C betaCoV according to Drexler et al.

Both the Italian CoV sequences closely cluster to corresponding CoVs identified in related bat species, forming with the latter two monophyletic lineages [9] (Fig. 2) . This finding is a rather expected occurrence, since CoVs are used to circulating in historical host species and only occasionally jump the species barrier. More specifically, ITA26/384/2012 (betaCoV), identified in E. serotinus, clusters with a sequence detected in Eptesicus isabellinus in Spain (GenBank accession number: HQ184062). Interestingly, this bat species, closely related to E. serotinus (E. isabellinus, also called the Isabelline serotine), circulates in the Northern Saharan region and has recently been detected in the south of Spain. ITA31/ 384/2012 (alphaCoV), identified in M. blithii, clusters with sequences detected in M. blithii and Miniopterus schreibersi in Spain (GenBank accession numbers: HQ184050 and HQ184049, respectively) and with one sequence collected from Myotis dasycneme in the Netherlands (GenBank accession number: GQ259976).

Colony sites are identified according to the bat species sampled (circle = mixed M. myotis and Myotis blythii; triangle = M. myotis; square = E. serotinus). Gray daggers indicate colonies positive for the presence of The Italian CoV sequences grouped with corresponding CoVs identified in Spanish bats. The lineage c betaCoV ITA26/384/2012, identified in E. serotinus, clustered with a sequence detected in Eptesicus isabellinus in Spain (GenBank accession number: HQ184062). The alphaCoV, ITA31/384/2012, identified in M. blithii, grouped with sequences identified in M. blithii and Miniopterus schreibersii in Spain and with one sequence collected from Myotis dasycneme in the Netherlands (GenBank accession number: HQ184050, HQ184049 and GQ259976, respectively). a Maximum likelihood (ML) tree estimated (using PhyML version 3.0) for the partial sequences codifying for the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase. A bootstrap resampling process (100 replications) using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method was used to assess the robustness of individual nodes of the phylogeny. Bootstrap values are indicated as numbers at the nodes. b Comparison of the amino acid sequence of ITA26/384/2012 with the highest related sequences publicly available. c Comparison of the amino acid sequence of ITA31/384/2012 with the highest related sequences publicly available",
