After 29 th February the number of reported cases increases linearly on the semi-logarithmic plot, indicating an exponential increase in cases.

The curves of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland indicate exponential growth. Based on the observations made in other countries around the world that have reported a high number of COVID-19 cases, it is expected that numbers in Australia will continue to rise exponentially. We estimate the number of cases expected to be reported during the next seven days, until 1 st April, by fitting the observed data to an exponential function. Figure 4 shows the cumulative number and predicted cumulative number of cases together with the 95% confidence interval (shaded area). If the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise exponentially, in a similar manner as observed in previous weeks, we predict that by 1 st April the number of reported COVID-19 cases in Australia could be as high as 11,908.

The three Mediterranean European countries, Italy, Spain, and France, have clear peaks in incoming travellers to Australia around the northern hemisphere summer, where Australian citizens and travellers return in significantly larger numbers. Some countries where returning residents dominate incoming travel, such as Japan and Thailand, demonstrate spikes in returning travellers around January, April, July, and October, coinciding with school holidays in Australia.
