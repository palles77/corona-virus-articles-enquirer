            "text": "Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), like its human homologues (HIV-1, HIV-2), requires a \u22121 translational frameshift event to properly synthesize all of the proteins required for viral replication. The frameshift mechanism is dependent upon a seven nucleotide slippery sequence and a downstream RNA structure. In SIV, the downstream RNA structure has been proposed to be either a stem-loop or a pseudoknot. Here, we report the functional, structural and thermodynamic characterization of the SIV frameshift site RNA. Translational frameshift assays indicate that a stem-loop structure is sufficient to promote efficient frameshifting in vitro. NMR and thermodynamic studies of SIV RNA constructs of varying length further support the absence of any pseudoknot interaction and indicate the presence of a stable stem-loop structure. We determined the structure of the SIV frameshiftinducing RNA by NMR. The structure reveals a highly ordered 12 nucleotide loop containing a sheared G-A pair, cross-strand adenine stacking, two G-C base-pairs, and a novel CCC triloop turn. The loop structure and its high thermostability preclude pseudoknot formation. Sequence conservation and modeling studies suggest that HIV-2 RNA forms the same structure. We conclude that, like the main sub-groups of HIV-1, SIV and HIV-2 utilize stable stem-loop structures to function as a thermodynamic barrier to translation, thereby inducing ribosomal pausing and frameshifting.",

            "text": "Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), requires a programmed \u22121 translational frameshift between the gag and pol coding regions of the viral mRNA. 1 The \u22121 frameshift allows for stop codon read-through at the end of the gag gene, and continued synthesis of the protein encoded by pol. This results in production of a Gag-Pol polyprotein fusion product, which upon proteolysis in immature virus particles will result in the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase enzymes, as well as the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid structural proteins. These structural and enzymatic proteins are found in approximately a 10:1 to 20:1 molar ratio in HIV type 1 (HIV-1), depending on the assay used. 2-8 This specific stoichiometry is required for appropriate packaging and formation of virus particles. [8] [9] [10] In retroviruses, the \u22121 translational frameshift is programmed by two cis-acting RNA elements: a seven nucleotide slippery sequence, and a downstream RNA structure. 11 In SIV, as in HIV-1, 2 the slippery sequence is UUUUUUA, and is universally conserved among all isolates analyzed (Los Alamos National Laboratories HIV Database, http://www.hiv.lanl.gov). In this work, we focus on a subtype of SIV (SIV SMM ) found in sooty mangabys (Cercocebus torquatus atys) and macaques (genus Macaca). This subtype is closely related to HIV type 2 (HIV-2), 12-14 while SIV from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) is more closely related to HIV-1. [12] [13] [14] [15] Two models have been proposed for the SIV SMM downstream RNA secondary structure, a stem-loop, 2 and an H-type pseudoknot 16,17 ( Figure 1 ). The pseudoknot model is based on the fact that seven nucleotides in the loop are complimentary to a downstream sequence; however, due to the high degree of sequence conservation, there is no observable covariance between these sequences that could be used to help validate the pseudoknot model. No structural data exists for the SIV frameshift-inducing RNA.",

            "text": "The sequence requirement for SIV SMM programmed translational frameshifting was investigated using a dual luciferase reporter assay. 21, 22 Briefly, SIV SMM sequences of varying length were cloned between Renilla and firefly luciferase reporter genes. In vitro translation of the frameshift reporter constructs was performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Frameshift efficiencies were calculated by comparing the experimental and control levels of firefly luciferase activity, after normalizing their Renilla luciferase activities as previously described. 21, 22 Results for all sequences tested showed frameshifting efficiencies from 7 to 12% ( Figure 2 ). These frameshifting frequencies are very similar to those measured for HIV-1 in vitro. 2-8 A 78-nucleotide sequence comprising all viral sequences necessary to form the potential pseudoknot ( Figure 1B) induced frameshifting to a level of 9.1 \u00b1 0.7 % (Figure 2 ). There is no significant difference between this value and the frameshifting frequencies observed for shorter constructs that cannot form a pseudoknot (e.g. 57 nt, 8.8 \u00b1 0.4 %). Sequences of 69, 63, 57, and 51-nucleotides induced frameshifting to 12.2%, 8.3%, 8.8%, and 7.1%, respectively ( Figure 2 ). These values were determined from 10 replicate measurements obtained from the same preparations of RNA and lysate. However, higher variability (+/\u2212 3%) in frameshifting is observed when comparing different preparations of lysate and RNA (data not shown). Regardless of the relatively small differences between the various constructs, the data indicate that pseudoknot formation is not a requirement for programmed translational frameshifting by SIV, since the 63, 57 and 51-nucleotide constructs cannot form pseudoknots but produce frameshifting efficiencies comparable to the 78-nucleotide construct. The increase in frameshift efficiency for the 69-nucleotide sequence may be due to the variability of the assay system, or it may possibly be more optimally folded in the context of the reporter gene.",

In particular, the four contiguous cytidines at the apex of the loop (C32 \u221235), which would be involved in the potential pseudoknot interaction (if present), overlay well. There are no changes in chemical shifts for C33\u221235 and C37 in the various constructs. Nucleotide C32 exhibits very minor chemical shift changes, but these are likely due to differences between sample preparations, since the chemical shifts for this nucleotide vary slightly even between different preparations of the same RNA sequence (data not shown). Other differences in the NMR spectra of the various constructs are solely due to the different lengths and helical sequences of the various constructs. Additionally, 2D NOESY experiments reveal the presence of the same NOEs in the loop for all constructs (data not shown). All of the imino protons and their hydrogen-bond acceptors involved in Watson-Crick base pairing have been assigned for SIV17\u221250 ( Figure 1E) , which cannot form a pseudoknot ( Figure 4 ). The same imino proton chemical shifts are observed for the two longer constructs ( Figure 1C and D), and upon addition of 10 mM magnesium, no new imino peaks indicative of new Watson-Crick base pairs are observed (data not shown). These results indicate that the RNA adopts the same stem-loop structure in all constructs regardless of ionic conditions.

Thirteen Watson-Crick base-pairs were confirmed by direct detection of trans-hydrogen-bond scalar couplings by HNN-COSY ( Figure 4) . Eleven of the Watson-Crick base-pairs correspond to the stem, while two additional G-C pairs were observed to form across the 12 nucleotide loop, between nucleotides G31-C37 and C32-G36. These assignments were confirmed by thermodynamic measurements and 1D NMR analysis of constructs with mutations of these loop nucleotides. Two cooperative melting transitions are observed: a lower-temperature transition at 66\u00b0C and a higher-temperature transition at 84\u00b0C ( Figure 5A ). These transitions can be assigned to the loop and stem regions of the molecule, respectively, by reference to experiments conducted on sequences that contain guanosine-to-cytidine mutations in the loop ( Figure 5B ), and also 1D NMR measurements as a function of temperature (data not shown). These data indicate that the stem is very stable, and the loop has a surprising degree of stability for a structure which is penalized 7.1 kcal/mole by mfold secondary structure prediction software. 23 The 66\u00b0C melting transition for the loop is also observed for the longer SIV14\u221270 construct ( Figure  1C and Supplemental data).",

Analysis of frameshift efficiencies of various constructs suggests that pseudoknot formation does not play a significant role in translational frameshifting, at least in vitro. Furthermore, we observe that the SIV loop is structured in a manner that precludes pseudoknot formation, since two of the nucleotides that would participate in such a pseudoknot are sequestered within stable Watson-Crick base-pairings across the loop. Hence, the 12 nucleotide loop is reduced to a compact CCC triloop conformation. To the best of our knowledge, the CCC triloop is a novel turn conformation. The triloop conformation consists of a base-stack of C33 on C32, with C34 flipped into the minor groove, and C35 adopting a syn-conformation ( Figure 7A ). The syn conformation of C35 is consistent with the observed intensity of the NOE between its H1' and H6 protons (Supplemental Data). The unique CCC triloop structure may be stabilized by a potential hydrogen-bond between the carboxyl oxygen of C34 and the ribose 2'OH of C37.",

Pseudoknot formation as depicted in the secondary structure model in Figure 1B is precluded by the length of the single-stranded linker region between the helical end and the loop, which is only 8 nucleotides. The SIV SMM stem-loop structure alone is 52 \u00c5 in length, and spans more than a full helical turn. Since the secondary structure in Figure 1B includes an additional lower helix (separated by a C-C mismatch of unknown geometry), it is likely that the 8 nucleotide linker would have to span a distance of > 60 \u00c5, which is physically impossible. The two constructs that we have studied that could potentially form pseudoknots have single stranded linkers that are 10 and 13 nucleotides long ( Figure 1C and D, respectively). These linkers are long enough to span the length of the helical turn. Since a translating ribosome paused at the slippery site would be already engaged with the mRNA approximately 13 nucleotides downstream of the first base in the P site (spanning the RNA from U1 to U13 in Figure 1A ), 27,28 the 4 base-pair helix at the base of the stem would be expected to be at least partially unwound prior to the frameshift event. This condition is mimicked in the SIV14\u221270 and SIV17\u221270 constructs ( Figures 1C and  D ), yet these constructs do not form detectable pseudoknot interactions. Thus, we conclude that the loop structure precludes pseudoknot formation by sequestering its nucleotides within a stable (Tm = 66\u00b0C) structure. Interestingly, a recently developed RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm capable of predicting pseudoknots 29 predicts that the stem-loop structure is more energetically favorable than the pseudoknot fold, and also predicts that the linker is capable of folding into an alternative three base-pair stem-loop structure that is incompatible with pseudoknot formation (data not shown).",

Additionally, when the differences between SIV SMM and HIV-2 are mapped to the SIV secondary structure, the only significant difference is observed as a single cytidine-to-uridine transition in the loop ( Figure  8B ), as all other sequence changes preserve the same base-pairing shown in Figure 1A (data not shown).

For these viruses, the stable stem-loops are sufficient to pause ribosomes and induce the appropriate level of frameshifting. Other viruses, such as the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) 32,41 or infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) 35,36 may require pseudoknot structures to attain the appropriate level of frameshifting because their slippery sequences (AAAAAAC for MMTV and UUUAAAC for IBV) are not as slippery. 42 In these cases, pausing alone may not be sufficient, and pseudoknots may be required because they are stereochemically mismatched substrates for the helicase. 43,44",

Residues with strong H1'-H2' and H1'-H3' cross-peaks (C33, C34, C35) in 2D 1 H-1 H TOCSY (40 msec mixing time) spectra were restrained to the C2'-endo range (\u03bd 1 : 25 \u00b1 15\u00b0, \u03bd 2 : \u221235 \u00b1 15\u00b0), residues without H1'-H2' cross-peaks (G28,A29,A30,G31,C37,A39) were restrained to the C3'-endo range (\u03bd 1 : \u221225 \u00b1 15\u00b0, \u03bd 2 : 37 \u00b1 15\u00b0), and residues which displayed an intermediate H1'-H2' cross-peak (C32, G36, A38, C50), indicative of an averaging of sugar puckers, were left unrestrained. Analysis of the peak volumes of internucleotide and intranucleotide H1'-H6/H8 and H2'-H6/H8 NOEs in 2D NOESY (50 msec mixing time) revealed that C35 was in the syn range; therefore, \u03c7 was restrained to 30 \u00b1 40\u00b0, as previously observed for a syn-cytidine. 24 All other residues in the loop were determined to be in the anti range, and were loosely restrained relative to their sugar pucker conformation (\u03c7 C3'-endo : \u2212160 \u00b1 30\u00b0, \u03c7 C2'-endo : \u2212125 \u00b1 30\u00b0, all other \u03c7 angles: \u2212140 \u00b1 35\u00b0).
