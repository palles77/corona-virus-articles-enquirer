            "text": "The purpose of the present study was to correlate the in vitro level of HIV Env expression by recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) with immunogenicity in mice. A 5-fold difference in Env synthesis was achieved at the translational level by the presence or absence of an out-of-frame initiation codon upstream of the env gene. This perturbation had no effect on the size or processing of Env. In contrast to the variation in Env synthesis, the rMVAs produced similar amounts of HIV Gag, which were expressed from identical cassettes. Mice immunized with the higher Env expressing rMVAs had about 15-fold higher titers of Env antibodies and several fold higher frequencies of Env-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells than mice immunized with the low expresser. The greater immune response achieved by high expression was maintained over a 100-fold dose range. Importantly, enhanced Env immune responses did not come at the expense of lower Gag T cell responses. These data suggest that for high immunogenicity, rMVAs should be engineered to produce the most recombinant protein that can be achieved without compromising the growth and stability of the rMVA.",

            "text": "A plethora of recombinant AIDS vaccines are in early stages of evaluation. Many of these vaccines consist of live, attenuated viruses that express HIV genes and induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. However, little is known regarding the most basic aspects of recombinant vaccine vector development. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between in vitro levels of protein expression and immunogenicities in an animal model. A highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus (VACV), called modified VACV Ankara (MVA), is replication-deficient in most mammalian cells [1, 2] and in mouse and monkey hosts [3, 4] . MVA is an attractive vector because of its safety in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice and non-human primates [4, 5] , in addition to its ability to highly express foreign gene inserts [6] and generate vigorous humoral and T cell responses to a variety of pathogens with or without heterologous priming [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Here we show a strong positive correlation between the amount of HIV Env synthesized by an MVA vector and the induction of both antibody and T-cell responses in mice.",

The env gene of the HIV clade B strain ADA was modified by removal of poxvirus transcription termination signals and truncation of 115 amino acids from the cytoplasmic tail of gp41. The latter alternation has been shown to increase the amount of Env protein on the surface of infected cells, the immunogenicity of Env in mice, and the stability of the recombinant virus in tissue culture [31] . We achieved differential Env expression by using the same mH5 promoter [24] to regulate transcription of env in each construct and modulating the efficiency of translation. Thus, insertion of env into the NotI site of the transfer vector pLAS-2 resulted in the presence of a premature translation initiation codon and a presumed out-offrame product of 33 amino acids (Fig. 1A, B1) . Reinitiation at the start of the env open reading frame was predicted to occur at a reduced level in accordance with the scanning model of translation [32] . In contrast, insertion of env into the SmaI site (Fig. 1B2 ) or after mutation of the upstream ATG codon (Fig. 1B3) , eliminated premature initiation and was therefore predicted to increase translation. Each env gene expression cassette was then inserted into del II of MVA by homologous recombination. Another rMVA containing a clade B HXB2/BH10 gag-pol gene regulated by the mH5 promoter in del III was constructed by insertion into pLAS-1 (Fig. 1A) followed by homologous recombination. MVAs expressing both Env and Gag-Pol were subsequently isolated by co-infecting cells with Env and Gag-Pol viruses and isolating double recombinants. Double recombinant viruses with env inserted at either NotI or SmaI sites of pLAS-2 were named MVA62B and MVA62BSm, respectively; the rMVA in which the ATG codon from the SphI site was removed was designated MVA62BSp. Two independent clones of MVA62BSm and MVA62BSp, designated 1 and 2, were isolated. Genetic stability of Env after 8 or 9 passages was demonstrated by staining plaques with Envspecific antibody.",

Splenocytes from individual mice were assayed directly ex vivo after overnight culture with Env peptide-pulsed P815 cells. CD8+ IFN-\u03b3+ cells were enumerated by flow cytometry. rMVAs expressing higher levels of Env induced 3 to 5-fold higher percentages of CD8+ IFN-\u03b3+ T cells in comparison to the lower Envexpressing MVA62B (Fig. 5A) . The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.008, 0.02, and 0.008) for MVA62BSm1, MVA62BSm2 and MVA62BSp2, respectively. In contrast to the difference in Env-specific CD8+ T cell responses, Gag-specific CD8+ IFN-\u03b3+ cell responses were similar with no statistically significant difference between groups (Fig. 5B) . Thus, the higher Env CD8+ T cell responses were specifically related to higher Env expression. Furthermore, the higher Env CD8+ T cell response did not compromise the Gag response.",

As above, similar Gag CD8+ T cell responses were induced by each rMVA and the effect of increasing virus dose was relatively modest, as previously reported [29] (Fig.6A) . The Envspecific CD8+ T cell responses were higher in mice inoculated with MVA62BSm1 and MVA62BSp2 as compared to those in mice inoculated with MVA62B. This difference was magnified several fold in mice receiving lower inocula. CD4+ T cell responses were also measured in mice after one or two immunizations with 10 3.7 to 10 5.7 pfu of rMVAs. The Gag-specific CD4+ T cell responses, like the corresponding CD8+ T cell responses, were similar whereas MVA62BSm1 and MVA62Sp2 elicited several fold higher anti-Env CD4+ responses than did MVA62B (Fig. 6B) .

To address this, we modulated the expression of the HIV Env protein by introducing an upstream translation initiation codon as described by Kozak [32] . This strategy provided some advantage over altering promoter strength because vaccinia virus late mRNAs traverse downstream genes and in theory can interfere with their transcription by promoter occlusion. The 5-fold lower expression of Env achieved in this manner is similar to the difference in expression of Env using our favored mH5 promoter and the weaker 7.5 promoter [24] , which has been used for rMVAs by some other groups [9, 33] . Although the upstream translation initiation site lowered the amount of Env, the protein size, cleavage pattern and incorporation into VLPs appeared unchanged. Comparative immunogenicity studies indicated a difference of 15-to 100-fold in the antibody response to Env and a several fold difference in Env-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The superiority of the high expressers was seen over a 100-fold range in virus inoculum size. We concluded that increasing the inoculum was not as useful as increasing the level of expression.",

A positive relationship between dose and immunogenicity was also obtained using rMVA [7, 29] . In comparing canarypox virus and MVA vectors, a positive correlation was found between expression levels and T cell responses in an in vitro assay of antigen presentation [38] . The need for high expression of a stable protein is also consistent with a recent report that CTL responses elicited by recombinant MVA are dominated by cross-priming mechanisms in vivo [39] .",

We have taken two approaches to accomplish this. The first is to modify HIV Env by truncating the cytoplasmic tail [31] . The second is to decrease the frequency of Env mutations and deletions (Wyatt, Earl and Moss, manuscript in preparation). Ultimately, for vaccine purposes, one should aim at constructing rMVA that produce as much recombinant protein as is consistent with the growth and stability of the rMVA. Electron micrograph of MVA62B and MVA62BSm1-infected HeLa cells. Infected HeLa cells were fixed and stained for transmission electron microscopy (A) or cryosectioned and immunostained with T8 and T32 mAbs to Env followed by 10 nm gold particles conjugated to protein A (B). Serum IgG ELISA Env responses. (A) Groups of 5-10 mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 10 7 pfu of rMVA and boosted at one month. At 2 weeks after the second immunization, mice were bled and serum IgG response determined by ELISA assay using purified ADA gp140 as antigen.

Diagram of transfer vectors pLAS-1 and pLAS-2, which insert into the sites of deletion (del) III and II of the MVA viral genome, respectively. Each contains a GFP gene controlled by the P11 strong late promoter as transient screening marker. The GFP gene is flanked by 280 (pLAS-1) or 217 (pLAS-2) bp direct repeat (DR) of one of the MVA flanks to facilitate removal of the GFP by spontaneous recombination during passage. The HIV gag-pol gene was cloned into the SalI site of pLAS-1, and env into the SmaI or NotI sites of pLAS-2. Transcription is controlled by the modified early/ late vaccinia mH5 promoter. B. Nucleotide sequences between the SmaI restriction site and the start of the Env open reading frame. (1) Insertion of env gene into the NotI site in the multiple cloning region of pLAS-2 results in a premature translational start site within SphI restriction site. (2) Insertion of env gene into SmaI site or (3) mutation of upstream ATG codon between the Sma1 and Not1 sites, respectively, eliminates premature translation start site.",
