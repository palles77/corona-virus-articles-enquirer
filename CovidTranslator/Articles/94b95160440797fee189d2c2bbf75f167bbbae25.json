Recombinant FCoV nucleocapsid protein (rNP) was used as a conjugate or test line in all 3 ICA kits ( CJ IgG/ T NP, CJ NP/ T NP, and CJ NP/ T PA). All three ICA kits were capable of detecting anti-FCoV antibodies; however, non-specific positive reactions of anti-FCoV antibody-negative plasma samples with the test line were observed in 2 ICA kits ( CJ IgG/ T NP and CJ NP/ T NP), in which rNP was used as the test line. On the other hand, the specific detection of anti-FCoV antibodies was possible in all plasma, serum, whole blood, and ascitic fluid samples using the ICA kit with protein A blotted as the test line ( CJ NP/ T PA). In addition, the specificity and sensitivity of ICA ( CJ NP/ T PA) were equivalent to those of the reference ELISA. The development of simple antibody test methods using the principle of ICA ( CJ NP/ T PA) for other coronavirus and feline viral infections is expected in the future.",

FCoV is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N) proteins, membrane proteins (M), and peplomer spike (S) proteins, and has been classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a; Motokawa et al., 1995) . Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: FIPV and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) . FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats, whereas FIPV infection has been shown to cause FIP (Pedersen, 2009 ). FIPV has been proposed to arise from FECV due to a mutation (Brown, 2011; Chang et al., 2010 Chang et al., , 2012 ; however, the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified. Therefore, no reliable method has been established to distinguish FIPV and FECV.",

Although exudate can be used to diagnose FIP in cats, accompanied by ascites and pleural effusion, not all cats with FIP retain exudate. Therefore, a biopsy is necessary for the antemortem diagnosis of FIP without exudate retention. Tru-cut and fine needle biopsies are minimally invasive, highly specific diagnostic methods; however, their sensitivity is low (Giordano et al., 2005) . FIP has typically been diagnosed comprehensively based on the clinical condition, hematological profile, and results of FCoV genomic RNA and FCoV-antibody measurements in cats suspected of FIP (Addie et al., 2009 ). An indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunochromatographic assay (ICA) are currently used to measure FCoV-antibodies. IFA and ELISA are highly sensitive and specific, but are also cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming. ICA is a simple antibody detection method, the results of which can be rapidly obtained at a low cost. However, the sensitivity of commercially available ICA test kits to detect the FCoV antibody was shown to be low (Meli et al., 2013) .",

When an outbreak of virulent FCoV (FIPV) infection occurs in these environments, most cats in the environment are likely to develop FIP (Wang et al., 2013) . An accurate and rapid test method is necessary to prevent an epidemic of FCoV infection. A low-cost FCoV test method is also needed to measure feline FCoV antibodies in animals maintained in multi-cat environments. The most appropriate diagnostic method meeting these conditions may be ICA. The detection of anti-FCoV antibodies using ICA requires no special device or reagent, and the results can be simply and rapidly obtained.

All the ICA test kits examined were capable of detecting anti-FCoV antibodies, while non-specific positive reactions of anti-FCoV antibody-negative plasma samples with the test line were noted in 2 ( CJ IgG/ T NP and CJ NP/ T NP) of the 3 kits. rNP was used as the test line in these 2 kits, and a non-specific reaction with serum was also observed (data not shown). The cause of this non-specific reaction remains unclear. Fig. 6 . The reactivity of ICA (CJNP/TPA) with plasma, serum, whole blood, and ascitic fluid samples.

The major antibody-binding domain was also shown to be present in the SARS-CoV N protein (He et al., 2004) . Based on these findings, the N protein may be appropriate to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies. The trial ICA examined in this study can be applied to the detection of antibodies during infection not only with FCoV, but also with other coronaviruses.",

As large amounts of serum and plasma from FCoV-infected cats had been stored prior to initiating the present study, a sufficient amount of affinity-purified cat anti-FCoV IgG could be prepared for the experiments conducted. However, on the assumption of commercializing ICA ( CJ NP/ T PA), it is practically difficult to secure large amounts of serum and plasma from FCoV-infected cats. Whether several FCoV N proteinrecognizing monoclonal antibodies can be used for the control line is currently being investigated to overcome this problem.",
