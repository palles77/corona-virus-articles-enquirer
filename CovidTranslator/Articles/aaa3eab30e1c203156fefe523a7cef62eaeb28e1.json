In addition, hospital staff needed training in infection control measures. We investigated infection control practices among 162 hospital health workers (109 nurses, 45 doctors and 8 therapists) and 44 support workers in one acute hospital and two rehabilitation hospitals using a non-blinded, observational design. We examined compliance with isolation precautions and infection control guidelines, including proper wearing of a mask, goggles/face shield, or gown; handling patient care equipment, linen, and laundry; routine and terminal cleaning; and terminal cleaning of an isolation room. One major breakdown in compliance was use of sleeveless disposable plastic aprons instead of long-sleeved gowns during procedures likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood and body fluids. In more than half of the observed episodes, participants failed to disinfect medical devices, such as stethoscopes, before re-use. Thorough cleansing of commodes between patients was also lacking. Overall compliance with local and international infection control guidelines was satisfactory, but several aspects required improvement.",

The key lesson is for healthcare workers to be vigilant and prepared to institute infection control measures should the need arise. Thus, education of health and support workers in infection control is vital. They should know current guidelines and be able to incorporate them into their usual work pattern. However, the continued high incidence of hospital-related infections indicates that, despite strong research evidence for changing practice, this may not occur for years due to lack of knowledge, expertise or equipment. 1 The SARS Expert Committee in Hong Kong found that hospital infection control standards were inadequate and in need of audit, development and implementation and that hospital staff needed training in infection control measures. 2 A survey of 306 nurses in an acute hospital in Hong Kong noted low compliance with, and selective adoption of, universal precautions. 3 However, no study has examined healthcare and support workers' compliance with isolation precautions.",

Stethoscopes are reported as a potential source of nosocomial infection and a study that determined the bacterial load on stethoscope membranes found that 234 of the 355 sampled carried two or more different bacterial species and that 31 carried potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter. Although some bacteria survived for up to 18 h on stethoscope membranes, none survived after disinfection. 10 Another study sampling 74 stethoscopes, including communal ones from hospital wards and 36 personal ones, also showed that the bell/diaphragm of 50% were colonised by significant numbers of bacteria including coagulase-negative staphylococci and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. 11 Using alcohol wipes to clean the diaphragm and the bell in between examinations is a simple step that could minimise the risk of cross-infection. 10 Some support workers did not clean and disinfect environmental surfaces such as doorknobs, faucet handles, and floors after patient discharge. Numerous studies have reported the frequent contamination of such surfaces in the ward and hospital environment with infectious materials that are able to survive for a few hours to days. 12 The SARS coronavirus in respiratory samples survived for 5 days at room temperature and surfaces contaminated with patients' droplets could pose a health risk to both patients and health personnel. 13 It has been reported that high-touch areas such as doorknobs and light switches around toilets in patients' rooms are not regularly terminally cleaned despite CDC recommendations. This is an area that merits reinforcement. 12 In the one episode, the support worker cleaned and disinfected all surfaces that were in contact with the patient and wiped down mattresses and headboards with hypochlorite. However, the privacy curtain was not removed for laundry and caution needs to be taken as a small scale study of 28 curtains on seven wards in one hospital showed that all curtains were contaminated with bacteria, and meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was identified on plates taken from one of the wards with an MRSA outbreak. 14 Health and support workers in the two rehabilitation hospitals performed poorly in the wearing of a gown, suggesting that additional training is warranted to enhance their knowledge of disease transmission. Nurses performed better in a number of isolation precautions, including putting on a gown and handling patient care equipment. They consistently have better attitudes towards, and are more compliant with, universal precautions. 15 In order to minimise the risk of occupationally acquired infections and the possibility of cross-contamination, all health and support workers should be more vigilant of all aspects of infection control practice. Those hospital workers with 5 years of experience performed less satisfactorily in handling patient care equipment, suggesting that opportunities for on-the-job training and continuous monitoring of infection control practice should be offered to younger and newer staff, with more experienced peers serving as role models for best practice.",
