This process is delicately adjusted by the variant residues of MHC I, especially the residues in the peptide binding groove (PBG). In a series of MHC I molecules, a salt bridge is formed above the N-terminus of the peptides. However, the potential impact of the salt bridge on peptide binding and T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of MHC I, as well as the corresponding molecular basis, are still largely unknown. Herein, we determined the structures of HLA-B*4001 and H-2K d in which two different types of salt bridges (Arg62-Glu163 or Arg66-Glu163) across the PBG were observed. Although the two salt bridges led to different conformation shifts of both the MHC I \u03b1 helix and the peptides, binding of the peptides with the salt bridge residues was relatively conserved. Furthermore, through a series of in vitro and in vivo investigations, we found that MHC I mutations that disrupt the salt bridge alleviate peptide binding and can weaken the TCR recognition of MHC I-peptide complexes. Our study may provide key references for understanding MHC I-restricted peptide recognition by T-cells.",

In the structures of MHC I presenting these short peptides, the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains of MHC I form a bed-like groove to comfortably accommodate the peptides: two \u03b1-helices as the bedrails and the \u03b2-sheets beneath as the mattress (Bjorkman et al., 1987; Niu et al., 2013) . The short peptides interact with the amino acids within the peptide binding groove (PBG) through different binding modes. First, the featured residues at the second position (P2) from the N-terminus and the last residue (P\u03a9) at the C-terminus of the peptides, termed primary anchor residues, protrude into the specific pockets in the PBG of the MHC I. Though the positions of the primary anchors on the peptides are relatively conserved, the binding modes of the anchoring residues of the peptides to different MHC I molecules are diversified due to polymorphisms in the pocket-forming residues. Second, the peptides also interact with the PBG via contacts between the backbone atoms of the peptides and the PBG residues (Mitaksov and Fremont, 2006) . Third, a hydrogen bond network is formed between the two termini of the peptides and the conserved residues in the PBG. The latter two interaction modes are relatively conserved between different MHC I molecules (Fremont et al., 1992; Madden et al., 1993) .",

However, based on the structures of a series of MHC I molecules, such as human HLA-B*2705 (Madden et al., 1991) , rhesus macaque Mamu-A*02 , and mouse H-2K d (Mitaksov and Fremont, 2006; Zhou et al., 2004) , there is a salt bridge positioned over the peptides formed by opposite charged residues from the \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices of MHC I, respectively. In humans and macaques, the salt bridge is formed by the positively charged Arg62 on the \u03b11 helix and the negatively charged Glu163 on the \u03b12 helix. Meanwhile, in mice, the involved residues are Arg66 on \u03b11 helix and Glu163 on \u03b12 helix. Both of these types of salt bridges overhang the N-terminal portion of the T-cell epitopes in the groove. Obviously, the salt bridge forms a ligature to tightly fix the peptides into the PBG. However, thus far, it is still largely unknown how the formation of these salt bridges in MHC I molecules impacts peptide binding.",

Generally, T-cell activation by the MHC-peptide complex may occur in three correlated ways: 1) direct interaction of the TCR with the MHC, termed MHC restriction; 2) direct interaction of the TCR with the solvent-accessible peptide main chain and side chains; and 3) interaction of the peptide with the TCR mediated by conformational perturbations in the MHCpeptide complex (Baker et al., 2012; Gras et al., 2012) . Crystallographic studies clearly demonstrate that the polymorphic amino acids in the grooves of MHC I molecules from different mammals may influence the peptide conformation, subsequently impacting T-cell recognition (Borbulevych et al., 2009; Hulsmeyer et al., 2004; Insaidoo et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, to our knowledge, it has not been determined if the salt bridges in some MHC I molecules impact TCR recognition through a direct interaction with the TCR or indirectly through modulation of the peptide conformation.",

Our results elucidated the key features of mammalian MHC I molecules with salt bridges in the PBG and will benefit T-cell based diagnosis and vaccine development.",

ELISPOT assays were then performed using freshly isolated splenocytes to assess the T-cell immune responses induced by the peptide. No specific reactivity of IFN-\u03b3 secretion could be detected in splenocytes separated from placebo-immunized mice (< 10 SFCs/10 5 splenocytes). In contrast, CD8 + T-cells from splenocytes of the mice immunized with peptide HBc87-95 presented strong IFN-\u03b3 production ( Fig. 2A) . The splenocytes from the peptide-inoculated mice were also stained with the H-2K d tetramers prepared in the presence of peptide HBc87-95. The splenocytes from HBc87-95-inoculated mice contained 0.75 \u00b1 0.36% of peptide-specific CD8 + T-cells ( Fig. 2B and C) . No peptide-specific CD8 + T-cells were identified from splenocytes of mice inoculated with placebo, as judged by HBc87-95 tetramer staining. We also constructed tetramers based on a series of mutated H-2K d MHC I heavy chains, including H-2Kd-M1, H-2Kd-M2, and the dual mutant H-2Kd-M3. When compared to the WT tetramer, the three mutant tetramers stained a lower proportion of HBc87-95-specific CD8 + T-cells within splenocytes from mice inoculated with peptide HBc87-95 (0.31 \u00b1 0.06%, 0.30 \u00b1 0.05%, and 0.29 \u00b1 0.09%, respectively).

This is due to the different positively charged residues in the salt bridges of the two MHC I molecules. However, in the structures of some MHC I available online thus far (e.g., H-2L d , H-2D b , and H-2D d ), though they possess the same salt bridge-forming residues (R62 and E163) as HLA-B*4001, no salt bridge is formed (PDB codes: 1LD9, 1CE6, 1BII) (Supplemental Fig. S1 ).

The hydrogen bonds constructed between residues R66 and E163 in H-2K d and between R62 and E163 in HLA-B*4001 are 2.59 \u00c5 and 2.75 \u00c5, respectively. 2) R62 or R66 in the salt bridge can form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the P2 residue of the bound peptide in the PBG (as in both the H-2K d and HLA-B*4001 structures, and through a water molecule in Mamu-A*02). 3) For the MHC I-binding peptides with a hydrophilic residue at the P1 position, hydrogen bonds can be found between E163 and the side chains of the P1 residue of the peptide (as in the H-2K d structure but not HLA-B*4001) (Fig. 4) . In HLA-B * 4002 and HLA-B*0702, a water molecule links the interaction between R66 and E163 (Fig. 4) .

The impact on the thermostability of HLA-B*4001 by the mutants was not as much as that observed in the H-2K d mutants. This is may be due to the intrinsic features of different salt bridges in the two molecules. Using structural analysis, we found that the enhancement effect of peptide binding to MHC I was not only contributed by the direct formation of the salt bridge above the peptide main chain but also contributed by the conserved hydrogen bonds between the salt bridge-forming residues with the atoms on the main chain and the P1 residues of the peptides. A previous study indicates that a salt bridge (also called an ion pair in the study) formed by Arg\u03b180 and Asp\u03b257 in MHC class II heterodimers is also critical for surface expression and peptide presentation (Nalefski et al., 1995) .

Birkinshaw et al. studied that a prototypical autoreactive BK6 TCR bound CD1a when the presented ligands were permissive. TCR docked over the A' roof of CD1a and a central CD1a salt-bridge network (Arg76-Glu154 salt-bridge) prevented the interaction between BK6 TCR and permissive ligands, and its autoreactivity was determined by contacts with CD1a. Nonpermissive ligands disrupted salt bridge interaction of CD1a, disrupt the properties of A' roof and could hinder engagement of hydrophobic CDR3\u03b2 loop of the BK6 TCR with CD1a (Birkinshaw et al., 2015) . Nurzia et al. indicate that the positive charging of Arg62 is preferred for the TCR recognition of Ankylosing Spondylitis-associated B*2705 complexes, as revealed by the R62 K and R62A mutants with an overall reduced capability to present peptides to CD8 + T-cells (Nurzia et al., 2012) . Our data also demonstrate that Tcell recognition was significantly alleviated when we broke the MHC I salt bridge with R66A and E163A mutations. Previously determined complex structure between HLA-B*07:02 and KFJ37 TCR showed that both the R62 and E163 of HLA-B*07:02 can form hydrogen bonds with the residues in the CDR3\u03b1 and CDR1\u03b1 loops of the TCR, respectively (Chan et al., 2018) . This indicated that the residues in the salt bridge can be directly-recognized by the TCR (Tynan et al., 2007) . Meanwhile, our analysis also demonstrated that the salt bridge can lead to a conformational shift of the presented peptide and the relative locations of the \u03b11 or \u03b12 helices, which may subsequently and indirectly impact TCR recognition. Further structural studies are required to investigate the accurate and detailed recognition of MHC I/peptide complex containing the salt bridge by the TCR.",

The mutant MHC I tetramers used in this study including the H-2K d mutants at R66 and/or E163A can dismantle the salt breakage and then may indirectly alter T cell response. However, these residues can also be recognized by TCR, thus, the mutation of these residues may also directly influence the TCR response. We cannot exclude the possibility that the altered T cell response was due to altered contacts with the mutated residues, rather than the loss of the salt bridge interaction.",

Our data is helpful for the understanding of the CD8 + T-cell recognition of MHC I-presented peptides. ",

(A) Binding of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antigen-derived immunodominant T-cell epitope HBc87-95 to H-2K d , its three salt bridge mutants (H-2Kd-M1: Mutant R66A, H-2Kd-M2: Mutant E163A and H-2Kd-M3: Mutant R66A&E163A) and three control mutants (H-2Kd-C1:Mutant R157A, H-2Kd-C2:Mutant A158 G and H-2Kd-C3:Mutant S69A) were elucidated by in vitro refolding. The absorbance peak of the H-2K d complex with the expected molecular mass of 45 kDa was eluted at the estimated volume of 16 mL on a Superdex 200 10/300 G L column. The profile is marked with approximate positions of the molecular mass standards of 75.0, 43.0, and 29.0 kDa. The blue colors in different shades represent the three control mutants, and the yellow, orange, red represent three salt bridge mutants, respectively. (B) Thermostability of peptide HBc87-95 complexed to H-2K d and its mutants by CD spectroscopy. The T m s of different complexes are indicated by the temperature when 50% of the protein unfolded at the black dashed line. We repeated CD at least three times for each protein, the results were showed by mean \u00b1 SD, Statistical significance of differences between the wild and mutant was determined by student's t test. **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. (C) HLA-B*4001, its three salt bridge mutants (B4001-M1: Mutant R62A, B4001-M2: Mutant E163A, and B4001-M3: Mutant R62A&E163A) and three control mutants (B4001-C1: Mutant A158 G, B4001-C2: Mutant R157A and B4001-C3: Mutant I66A) complexed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N)derived T-cell epitope N216-225 were refolded in vitro.
