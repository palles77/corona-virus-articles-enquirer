We were to demonstrate that the use of low-cost barriers (clear plastic drapes) were able to significantly limit the aerosolization and droplet spray. Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount. However, PPE is a limited resource and often requires providers to be adaptive and resourceful in a crisis. The inexpensive and simple method of using clear drapes during extubation (and possibly intubation) of COVID-19 patients may be considered by frontline HCPs and infection control specialists as an additional precaution. Modifications of the clear plastics can be adapted for surgical procedures that may be AGMPs. Limitations of this work include its low-fidelity design and use of a larger particle (Glo-Germ) that may not reflect true spread of a virus like SARS-CoV-2. It is particularly important that HCPs take care not generate further aerosols during removal of the drapes; and recommend using the three-panel draping as opposed to the single drape technique.",

            "text": "Reports on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have resulted in concerns over increased risk for infection, especially with global shortages of personal protection equipment (PPE) needed for droplet precautions. 2 Contamination of surfaces and personnel with virus-loaded droplets may occur during high-risk aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP), such as intubation and extubation. A recent report recommended the use of gauze around the patient's mouth as a method for reducing the aerosolization of the virus. 1 Our group performed a series of experiments assessing whether clear plastic drapes were effective in containing aerosolization during extubation. These experiments did not require institutional research ethics approval. All experiments utilized Glo-germ\u2122 (Glo Germ Company, Moab, UT, USA), a fluorescent resin powder with particle sizes between 1-5 \u00b5m (SARS-COV-2 is 0.07-1.2 \u00b5m), with ultraviolet light detection in a darkened operating room. A pediatric manikin (Eletripod ET/J10 Tracheal Intubation model, Tuqi, China) was used wherein simulated secretions (0.5 mL of Glo-germ) were applied to the oropharynx and the mid-trachea of the manikin. A cough was simulated using a calibrated medical air gun connected to the distal trachea, fired over 0.4 sec, delivering cough peak expiratory flow rates (CPEFR) of 150-180 L\u00b7min -1 outward from the All rights reserved.

All experiments were video recorded (240 fps) using a combination of GoPro Hero 6 (GoPro Inc, San Mateo, CA, USA), iPhone X, X Max, and XR (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA).In the first series of experiments (Exp), we simulated a cough during extubation of the manikin both without (Exp 1A) and with (Exp 1B) a single clear plastic drape applied over the head and endotracheal tube. We then repeated the same extubation cough sequence in a second series of experiments (Exp 2) using a modified three-layer plastic drape configuration. The first layer was placed under the head of the manikin to protect the operating table and linen. The second torso-drape layer was applied from the neck down and over the chest, preventing contamination of the upper torso. The final over-head top drape was a clear plastic drape with a sticky edge that was secured at the mid sternum level. It was draped over the patient's head to prevent contamination of the surrounding surfaces, including the HCPs. After the cough was complete, the top two drapes were rolled away together toward the patient's legs, to contain and remove the contaminant and the third drape removed afterward.A cough without any plastic drapes applied (Exp 1A) resulted in a wide distribution of droplets contaminating the surrounding areas (Figure A and eVideo in the Electronic Supplementary Material [ESM]). A The use of a single clear plastic drape (Exp 1B) restricted the aerosolization and droplet spraying of the particles, but using the three-drape technique (Exp 2) resulted in significant further reduction in contamination of the immediate area surrounding the patient(Figure B; eVideo in the ESM). An area of significant contamination, a \"hot-zone\" was noted on the drape covering the bed beneath the mannequin head (Figure C). The patient's face All rights reserved.
