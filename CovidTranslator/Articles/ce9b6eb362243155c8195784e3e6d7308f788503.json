Dogs and cats frequently eat the placenta and will occasionally consume dead fetuses as well. The placenta is the most critical tissue to obtain and can have more diagnostic value than the fetus itself. 4 Submission of fetuses/deceased neonates, placenta, and serum from the dam is ideal. Early submission and proper storage and transport of samples are critical to prevent tissue autolysis, which can inhibit both histopathologic interpretation and ancillary testing. 4 In outbreak situations within kennels or catteries, submission of acute and convalescent serum samples from affected and unaffected bitches or queens is extremely useful in tracking infections as they progress through the population.",

When presented with a dead fetus or neonate, the animal may be forwarded as a whole carcass to the diagnostic laboratory. Alternatively, the submitting veterinarian can perform a necropsy with appropriate samples collected and shipped. When submitting samples, record any gross abnormalities observed on the general accession form and, ideally, capture a few gross images as part of the submission. However, rarely will gross lesions be observed even when infectious causes are suspected. Because of this it is critical to collect samples for histopathology, serology, bacteriology, and virology in order to attempt to identify a cause. If a fungal disease is suspected, fungal cultures usually need to be specifically requested on the submission form as not all fungal organisms will grow on routine aerobic cultures. Definitive diagnosis is not always achieved but this testing scheme will help rule out infectious causes.",

            "text": "Infectious causes of abortion in dogs and cats can be broadly grouped into viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoal diseases. The diagnostic protocol proposed in this chapter attempts to identify infection with a particular organism, targeting the most common causes of fetal and neonatal death in the United States. This protocol does not include testing for less common etiologies, such as Leishmania spp and bluetongue virus (BTV). 6, 7 The most common cause of viral abortion and neonatal death in dogs is herpesviral infection. 8 -11 Puppies can be infected in utero or at the time of parturition and death can occur in utero or up to 3 weeks following birth. 12 Body temperature plays an important role in neonatal herpesviral mortality, with viral replication optimized at lower temperatures. 12 Clinical presentations include sudden death, lethargy, and excessive crying. 12 Herpesviral infection in dogs is usually easy to diagnose on postmortem examination and is characterized by multiorgan haemorrhages, the most notable of which are seen in the kidney, lung, and liver (Fig. 6) . 12 Herpesviral infection can be confirmed with histopathology and polymerase chain reaction. In cats, herpesviral infection as a cause of abortion is extremely rare and is most often associated with respiratory disease in the queen rather than direct infection of the fetus. 13 As in dogs, neonatal death due to herpesvirus can be seen in kittens. 10 For more information on herpesviral infection in dogs, please see article by Decaro and colleagues elsewhere in this issue.",

            "text": "Other viral infections known to cause sporadic abortions and neonatal death in dogs include BTV, canine parvovirus-1 (canine minute virus), canine distemper virus (CDV), and canine adenovirus-1 (CAV1). 10, 14 Fetal and/or neonatal death may be secondary to maternal morbidity or due to direct infection. 10 elsewhere in this issue. Abortions associated with CDV are rare and most often associated with maternal morbidity. In a small percentage of cases, the virus can cross the placenta and result in direct fetal infection. 15 CAV1 is not typically associated with abortion; however, CAV1 infection has been associated with fatal pneumonia in pups less than 4 weeks of age. 16 Causes of sporadic viral abortion and neonatal death in cats include feline leukemia virus, feline parvovirus (feline panleukopenia virus), feline immunodeficiency virus, feline coronavirus, and feline calicivirus (FCaV). 10,13,16 -20 Most of these viral infections are covered in detail in article by Decaro and colleagues elsewhere in this issue. FCaV infection in the queen can result in abortion secondary to maternal morbidity. Rarely, FCaV can cross the placenta, resulting in fetal infection, widespread cutaneous hemorrhages within the fetus, and subsequent abortion. 18 The two most common causes of bacterial abortion and neonatal death in dogs are Brucella canis and Streptococcus spp infection. 3, [21] [22] [23] [24] Additional information on these organisms is provided in article by Graham and Taylor elsewhere in this issue. Infection with other bacterial organisms, such as Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp, Leptospira spp, and Salmonella spp can occur sporadically. 3, [25] [26] [27] Most bacterial causes of abortion and neonatal death will be isolated during routine aerobic cultures. 26 Although Brucella spp will grow on routine blood agar plates, colonies often take several days to become visible. Because of this, routine cultures that are reported as \"no growth\" at 48 hours have not ruled out brucellosis. Other exceptions include Salmonella spp and Campylobacter spp, both of which require special culture techniques. Leptospira spp are extremely difficult to culture, and growth can take several weeks. Paired serology on blood from the bitch or queen is a rapid diagnostic tool for leptospirosis. It is important to remember that recent vaccination of the dam may interfere with serologic interpretation. Histopathology is recommended to confirm that the organisms isolated from routine bacterial cultures are indeed associated with an infectious process and not a contaminant. This is particularly true concerning isolates from the placentas it is often contaminated by feces and other material that may be present in the birthing area. Bacterial causes of abortion in cats are similar to those in dogs, with the exception of brucellosis. 13, 17, 28, 29 Abortions due to fungal infection are rare in dogs and cats.",
