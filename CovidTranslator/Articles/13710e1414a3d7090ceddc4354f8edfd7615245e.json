Thus, we report in this review the state of the art of clinical target detection with SPR-based biosensors in complex matrices (e.g., serum, saliva, blood, and urine) as well as in standard solution when innovative approaches or advanced instrumentations were employed for improved detection. The principles of SPR-based biosensors are summarized first, focusing on the physical properties of the transducer, on the assays design, on the immobilization chemistry, and on new trends for implementing system analytical performances (e.g., coupling with nanoparticles (NPs). Then we critically review the detection of analytes of interest in molecular diagnostics, such as hormones (relevant also for anti-doping control) and biomarkers of interest in inflammatory, cancer, and heart failure diseases. Antibody detection is reported in relation to immune disorder diagnostics. Subsequently, nucleic acid targets are considered for revealing genetic diseases (e.g., point mutation and single nucleotides polymorphism, SNPs) as well as new emerging clinical markers (microRNA) and for pathogen detection. Finally, examples of pathogen detection by immunosensing were also analyzed. A parallel comparison with the reference methods was duly made, indicating the progress brought about by SPR technologies in clinical routine analysis.",

            "text": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) appeared as revolutionary technology almost 25 years ago, when the first commercial instrumentation was launched on the market by Pharmacia Biosensors AB, a Swedish company, derived from Pharmacia AB. The company developed an innovative technology by the joint effort of physicists, chemists, biologist, engineers, and computer scientists. Since then, many scientists joined the SPR to test new applications in various analytical fields, such as food safety [1] (e.g., mycotoxins [2] , genetically modified organism (GMO) [3] ), microbial contamination such as Escherichia coli [4] , doping analysis [5] , laboratory medicine [6, 7] , proteomics [8, 9] , bacteria detection [10] , and also environmental monitoring [11] . Among them, assuredly, clinical analysis has also been explored as a fruitful application field. The advantages brought about by current SPR technology include real-time monitoring of the analyte/molecular markers, label free and parallel analysis (with SPRi), minimal sample pretreatment, quantitative response, and very good sensitivity and reproducibility, (reported detection limits are in atto-or femtomolar ranges and coefficient of variations below 10 %). These features, coupled to miniaturization, make SPR suitable for point of care (POC) diagnostics [12] , where fast analysis and multi-analyte detection are mandatory.",

Classic SPR spectroscopy is based on the monitoring of coupling angle, coupling wavelength, intensity, phase [15] , whereas SPR imaging (SPRi) is based on the measurement of reflectivity of monochromatic incident light at a fixed angle by means of a CCD camera. Compared with traditional SPR, SPRi offers main breakthroughs such as multiplexed detection (by designing 2-D patterned microarrays of molecular probes) and the real-time visualization of the whole biochip surface to monitor simultaneously multiple bioreceptor/analyte bindings with the parallel support of a digital image, representing the intensity of binding in a color scale [19] .

Here we will present and discuss works that appeared in the last years aiming at developing robust and reliable SPR assays in clinical diagnostics. Among bioreceptors, we can enumerate antibodies, nucleic acid probes or synthetic receptors (molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs), aptamers, or artificial DNA (XNA). Accordingly, it is customary to talk about immunosensors, nucleic acid sensor, aptasensor, and so on. An immunosensor uses the affinity interaction between an antigen and an antibody [26, 27] . Nucleic acid (NA) sensors are based on oligonucleotidic probes and NA hybridization reaction [25, 28] . In NA sensors, artificial nucleosides (XNA) oligomers have also been employed as bioreceptor for clinical applications. XNAs increase sensor stability by avoiding biodegradation or exploiting improved affinity of XNA versus the target sequence compared with conventional DNA probes. D'Agata et al. reviewed works dealing with the great potential of artificial DNA (PNA, LNA, HNA, and MORF) in nucleic acid SPR-based sensing, exhibiting higher selectivity and sensitivity in detecting complementary or mismatching nucleic acid targets [29] .",

More recently (2012), Bedford et al. have specifically reviewed the recent trend of incorporation of GNPs within the sensing surface itself or as tagging molecules in SPR biosensor. Significant sensitivity increases and DLs decreases were described for a variety of analytes [41] . As reported by Minunni and Spoto, the increase of sensitivity is explainable by both the mass enhancement of the NPs in the EW as well as by the optical coupling between surface plasmons (SPs) and electric fields of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) of NPs when they are close to the metallic surface [38] . LSPs are defined as collective electron oscillations confined in the MNP surface and promoted by interaction with the light. If the MNP dimension is much smaller than the wavelength of the excitation light, the local electromagnetic fields are strongly enhanced. A further contribution to the increase of sensitivity is also expected if NPs clustered since it was proven that clusters of spherical metal and dielectric colloids show strong electric, magnetic, and Fano-like resonances from the electromagnetic coupling between closely spaced particles [38] .",

Very recently, graphene-based surface plasmon resonance interfaces were also studied for suitable application in SPR sensor. The functionalized surfaces showed several advantages such as high surface-to-volume ratio, adsorption of organic or biological molecules (pi stacking), passivation against oxidation, and controlling the number of graphene layers [43] . Other strategies, different from NPs-based approach, have been also adopted in this last decade for the improvement of SPR based sensor. In 2011, Abbas et al. collected the last forefront tendencies in SPR instrumentation with advanced performances identified in: new excitation schemes and optical configurations, liquid handling by microfluidics, and microsystems for integrated SPR chips generally based on glass or poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). New material such conducting metal oxides ZnO and ZnO/Au in the adhesion layer to replace Cr or Ti were also discussed as well as forefront SPR-related optoelectronic components (light source and detector) and finally the SPR coupling with other analytical techniques (hyphenation approach with scanning probe microscopy, electrochemistry, fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy) were also evaluated for the achievement of higher sensitivity and resolution [44] .",

Finally, streptavidin-conjugated nanobeads (50 nm in diameter) were added for signal amplification, enhancing sensitivity, and lowering DL from 10 \u03bcg/L (2.9 nM) to 25 ng/L (7.2 pM). Linearity was observed in the 0-1000 ng/L BNP concentration range, confirming the suitability of this immunosensor for clinical necessities since the normal level of BNP in plasma is about 20 ng/L but it increases approximately to 1 \u03bcg/L during acute or chronic cardiac failure. Sensitivity was comparable to commercially available reference assays for BNP (RIA and chemiluminescent reactions (4-2000 ng/L) [68] .

Then acetylthiocholine was added as substrate and hydrolyzed by acetylcholine esterase. The thiol compound (thiocholine) produced covalently bound to a thin gold layer located downstream in the microchannel, generating a SPR angle shift monitored as analytical signal. A concentration range from 5 to 100 ng/L was examined and trace levels of analyte (15 fg) were detected in about 30 min. CV% for five measurements of 100 ng/L BNP was 33.1 % and although this value was high compared with a commercial immunosensing system, the authors considered the RSD% acceptable for clinical diagnosis since BNP concentration significantly increases in heart failure patients [69] , as mentioned above.",

Inter-chips RSDs% of the sensor response was estimated to be within the 8 %-18 % range whereas intra-chip RSD% was found to be lower (\u223c10 %), showing a good reproducibility in both situations. In summary, the analytical performances were comparable with that of a conventional peptide-based immunoassay (ELISA) [134] .",
