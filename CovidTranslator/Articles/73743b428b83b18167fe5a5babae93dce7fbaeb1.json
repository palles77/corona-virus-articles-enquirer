Both gene fragments were designated GP5a and GP5b, respectively. They were ligated with a linker and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector, pET-30a. Expression of the protein of interest was induced by isopropyl \u2424-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The purified protein was used as an immunogen to elicit antibody in rabbit. The immunoreactivity of the protein was determined using ELISA and Western blot. Biologically active GP5 and anti-GP5 antibody inhibited cell infection by PRRSV. Moreover, the antibody produced in this study was capable of detecting the cell infection by PRRSV and distinguishing this virus from other viruses.",

The hydrophobic peptide putatively influences the protein expression in prokaryotic expression system. Therefore, we tried to express a truncated GP5 gene without signal peptide sequence in E. coli, however, the protein of interest was not achieved at various inductive expression conditions (data not shown). We supposed that the predicted transmembrane regions (residues 60-130) might have impacted the expression of GP5. Using site-directed PCR, two fragments were amplified and inserted into the same expression vector.
