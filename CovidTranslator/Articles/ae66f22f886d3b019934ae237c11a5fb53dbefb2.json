We investigated the prediction of the alternative receptors for 2019-nCoV. Lasso's study have predicted PPIs between 28 human cell membrane proteins which were members of receptorome of human-infecting viruses, and the spike protein of two coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV. We supposed that the 2019-nCoV is very likely to use these spike-interacting proteins as alternative receptors. These spike-interacting proteins were ranked by the score provided by the RF model (Figure 1 ). The expression levels of these spike-interacting proteins in 32 common human tissues were shown in Figure 1 . Most of them had high expressions than ACE2 in the lung, such as APP, EZR, CD4 and so on. (Lasso et al., 2019) . A variable number of human cell membrane proteins were predicted to interact with viral RBPs. To further select the potential receptors for viruses, both the LR and the RF model could be used to rank the viral RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins. The RF model was found to rank the real receptors better than the LR in a small validation dataset, suggesting that the RF model may perform better than the LR in selecting the real receptors from the predicted RBP-interacting human cell membrane proteins.",

The RBPs of human-infecting viruses were compiled from three sources: the ViralZone database (Masson et al., 2012), the UniprotKB database during which viral proteins annotated with GO terms \"viral entry into host cell\" or \"virion attachment the host cell\", and the literatures related to viral RBPs. Viruses of the same viral family were supposed to use the same RBP. For example, all coronaviruses were supposed to use the spike protein as RBP.",

Our previous studies have shown that human virus receptors have some unique features compared to other cell membrane proteins: high level of N-glycosylation, high number of interaction partners and high expressions. This study further built a RF model for identifying human virus receptors from human cell membrane proteins with accepted accuracy. Based on the RF model, the receptorome for human-infecting virome were predicted which included a total of 729 human cell membrane proteins. They could facilitate identification of human virus receptors. Previous studies by Lasso et al. developed computational models for predicting PPIs between human-infecting viruses and humans",
