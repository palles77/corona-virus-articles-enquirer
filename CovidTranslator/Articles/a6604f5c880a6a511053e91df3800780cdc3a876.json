            "text": "Defining what constitutes a flood can be quite complex as floods can take many forms; therefore, no universal definition exists. Generally and in the context of this review, a flood is defined as the overflow of areas that are not normally submerged with water or a stream that has broken its normal confines or has accumulated due to lack of drainage. 3 Overall, different flood characteristics affect the severity of the flood event; specifically, regularity, speed of onset, velocity of flow, and depth of water. Quantifying the level of flooding has proven to be difficult; however, the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) provides information about flood events and the impact of floods. For a flood to be classified as a disaster or flood event by EM-DAT one of the criteria must be fulfilled: either ten or more people killed; 100 or more people affected; declaration of a state emergency; and/or call for international assistance. EM-DAT defines a flood as a significant rise in water level in a stream, lake, reservoir, or coastal region and includes general river floods, flash floods, and storm surges or coastal flooding.",

In Europe from 2003-2012, 19 flash floods and 162 general floods were reported by EM-DAT. In terms of the number of people affected, 7 out of the 20 most important floods ever recorded in Europe occurred during the 2000-2010 decade. 4 A study concluded a rising number in flood disasters from 1950-2005 in the European Union (EU). 5 According to Frei et al. 6 there has been a significant trend toward increased intense winter rainfall events in Europe. Other studies do not find a rising incidence of flooding. For example Mudelsee et al. 7 examined river flood patterns in Central Europe, and despite the occurrence of two flood events exceeding the 100-year flood level in 1997 and 2002, found no increased trend in extreme flood frequency over recent decades. Analyzing the more frequent, small-magnitude flood events as well as high-magnitude floods can make it easier to detect shifting trends in flood frequency. 6 Flood trend analysis is essential to understand future flood risk and vulnerability.",

[22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Several studies have implicated excess rainfall in water-borne disease outbreaks because of the transportation of bacteria, parasites, and viruses into water systems. Marcheggiani et al. 18 showed a potential association between flood events and a range of water-borne infectious diseases in Italy; including, legionellosis, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, and infectious diarrhea. Reacher et al. 28 performed a historical cohort study following a severe flood in 2000 in Lewes, Both climatic and non-climatic impacts, such as land-use dynamics, are expected to influence future flooding in Europe. Although considerable limitations remain in the ability to make robust projections of changes in flood size and frequency due to climate change, common projections appear to be emerging. According to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) SREX Report 8 there is a 66-100% probability that the intensity of heavy precipitation and the proportion of total rainfall will increase particularly in northern mid-latitudes and high latitudes of Europe. The highest total precipitation increases are projected to occur during the winter months. Although the IPCC states a general decrease in mean precipitation in the southern European region, rainfall may become more irregular and intense. However there remains low confidence in projections of changes in riverine floods. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of storm surges and coastal flooding due to rise in sea levels, and threaten an additional 1.6 million people per year in Europe by the 2080s. 9 Overall, changes in the climate that may affect the transmission of infectious diseases include temperature, humidity, altered rainfall, and sea-level rise.",

            "text": "In Marseilles, France the incidence of leptospirosis identified in the laboratory increased significantly between January 2001 and July 2011 (p < 0.0001). 38 Between 1991 and 2003, the rate of leptospirosis incidence in southern France was very low, 0.09 cases/100,000 inhabitants. In 2008, this incidence increased to England. The risk of gastroenteritis was significantly associated with depth of flooding in people whose households were flooded (RR = 1.7; 95% CI 0.9-3.0; p for trend by flood depth = 0.04). Additionally, an outbreak of norovirus in American tourists was linked to direct exposure to floodwater contaminated with raw sewage in Germany. 29 Earlier research has shown an association between waterborne diseases and flooding in high-income countries. From 1948-1994, more than half of the water-borne disease outbreaks in the United States were preceded by heavy rainfall (p = 0.002). 30 Research from Finland found that 13 water-borne disease outbreaks from 1998-1999 were associated with un-disinfected groundwater contaminated by floodwaters and surface runoff. 32 Surveys in high-income countries where individuals reported their own symptoms have indicated an increase in water-borne diseases following flooding. 28, [30] [31] [32] Rodent-borne Rodent-borne diseases are climate sensitive and may increase during heavy rainfall and flooding because of altered patterns of human-pathogen-rodent contact. 15 Flooding and heavy rainfall have been associated with numerous outbreaks of leptospirosis from a wide-range of countries around the world. 15, 21, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Areas at the highest risk for leptospirosis outbreaks are those where multiple risk factors are likely to coexist; such as, increased flooding Ahern et al. 15 reviewed earlier studies addressing flood-associated outbreaks of leptospirosis from a wide-range of countries: Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, India, Korea, Mexico, Nicaragua, Portugal, and Puerto Rico. In 1997 in the Krasnodar Territory in Russia, a severe outbreak of leptospirosis took place in connection with a high flood. 49 Sanders et al. 50 stated that flooding after heavy rain favors leptospires. It prevents animal urine from being absorbed into the soil or evaporating; therefore leptospires may pass directly into the surface water or persist in mud. The evidence of this review, supported by several other reviews, suggests the association between leptospirosis and flooding is fairly robust even in high-income countries.",

Local destruction of breeding sites after flooding has receded is extremely effective, so individuals should remove unused vessels and stagnant water when possible. Water storage containers need to be covered to protect from disease vectors, such as egg-laying female mosquitoes. Individuals can protect themselves against mosquito bites by using repellents during biting hours, mosquito nets, and screens in doors and windows. Individual and community awareness and participation is essential for successfully reducing the risk of infectious diseases following flooding. Understanding the social and cultural influences on response behavior in the time of a flood emergency is crucial to inform the design and targeting of warnings and health education messages. 1",

However, there remains scientific uncertainty about the strength of association between infectious disease incidence and flooding. Floods can cause population displacement and changes in population density, raise concern about waste management and the availability of clean water, as well as affect the availability and access to healthcare services. All of these are risk factors for an infectious disease outbreak. Kouadio et al. 13 and Watson et al. 67 suggested that unless there is a substantial population displacement, there is minimal risk of infectious disease transmission and outbreaks following flooding. Overall, the risk of infectious disease following flooding is context-specific, differs between countries, and is dependent upon a number of synergistic factors. Outbreaks of leptospirosis and diarrheal diseases following flooding have been documented in Europe 18, 24, 28, 29, 34, 36, 38, [41] [42] [43] but the evidence of increased incidence of vector-borne diseases following flooding is lacking because the time lag before onset can be several months. 68 Past studies have indicated possible associations between vector-borne diseases and flooding in Europe. 36, [59] [60] [61] European residents may be exposed to these risks while traveling. Foreign relief workers can potentially introduce infectious diseases into an area affected by flooding and these workers may be susceptible to endemic diseases that are more prevalent because of the flood.",

An enhanced surveillance system should be adaptable and context-specific, monitor key epidemiological data and compare with baseline data, monitor vulnerable groups, identify any emerging outbreaks, and result in timely public health action. In high-income countries, risk assessments and surveillance systems need to be very refined to detect small differences from baseline incidence data. 51 Prevention of infectious diseases following flooding involves maintenance of health services, provision of shelter, clean water supplies, proper sanitation, regular and adequate food supply, and in some cases mass vaccination campaigns and control of disease vectors. 62, 63 Water and sanitation are vital elements in the transmission of water-borne diseases; hence, providing clean drinking water is a priority in the initial days following flooding. Clasen et al. 65 found that household interventions were more effective in preventing diarrhea than interventions at the water-source. Interventions at the household level reviewed included: chlorination, filtration, solar disinfection, and combined flocculation and disinfection.

Many studies attempted to collect data retrospectively, had methodological shortcomings, lacked longitudinal data/baseline health data, control groups for comparison, and measures of clear disease outcomes. The studies included in this review were mainly observational studies with widely varying quality levels and study designs. Because it is unethical to conduct experimental studies on this topic, rigorous observational studies must be continue to be undertaken. Observational studies can present particular challenges because of the unpredictability of the timing and location of floods. Reporting and recall bias was very likely in many studies. Additionally, many studies relied on data from disease surveillance systems. Obtaining relevant disease surveillance data pre-, mid-, and post-flooding is frequently challenging. Population displacement can distort the rates of comparison for infectious disease incidence. The quality and robustness of disease surveillance systems can vary from country to country, and a country with a weak disease surveillance system will probably lack pre-flood baseline data. Flood damage to pre-existing public health infrastructure can exacerbate weaknesses in a disease surveillance system. Furthermore, it is difficult to attribute an increase in infectious disease incidence solely to a flood event, and therefore this issue may be under-investigated and under-reported. Finally, this systematic review is not entirely exhaustive, and there may be many other reports in gray literature, but the quality is likely to be lower than the peer-reviewed published reports identified.",
