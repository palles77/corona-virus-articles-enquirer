Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) spread in a similar fashion as Rhinoviruses, by direct contact with infected secretions or large aerosol droplets [1] . Health care workers are at increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection, possibly due to direct contact with the patients. Indeed, transmission of HCoVs through environmental contamination has been reported in healthcare settings [2] . Understanding which are the potentially contaminated surfaces in a healthcare environment is crucial to protect healthcare workers from this virus showing an unprecedented exponential trend with a doubling time of 3.6-4.1 days [3] . In this regard, studies suggest that surfaces and suspensions can carry HCoVs, increasing the risk of contact transmission that could lead to hospital acquired HCoVs infections [4, 5] Since February 21, 2020, when the first autochthonous case in Italy was confirmed, an overwhelming number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is continuously being detected, exceeding 8,000 cases at the time of writing. Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, is a 1,300-bed tertiary teaching hospital in Northern Italy and a national SARS-CoV-2 referral center. The hospital houses 23 ICU beds and 44 Infectious Diseases (ID) beds, the latter being distributed in two floors.",

Environmental samples were obtained by using a sterile flexible nasopharyngeal nylon flocked premoistened swabs (FLOQSwabs\u2122, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) dipped in 3 ml universal transport medium (UTM\u2122, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy). Total nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) were extracted from 200 l of UTM\u2122 using the QIAsymphony\u00ae instrument with QIAsymphony\u00ae DSP Virus/Pathogen Midi Kit (Complex 400 protocol) according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Specific real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and E genes were used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 according to WHO guidelines [8] and Corman et al. protocols [9]. Sixteen swabs were collected from inanimate surfaces at high risk of contamination inside the wards. All inanimate surfaces and materials at high risk of contamination were free of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. At the time of writing no cases of COVID-19 has been detected in the staff involved in the patient care. While this of course does not exclude the risk of transmission, it does provide evidence that the protective measures implemented in our setting significantly decrease the risk of environmental contamination and reduce concerns over healthcare workers contamination and infection, at least from inanimate surfaces in areas that are either preserved as clean or decontaminated. Our findings therefore validate our cleaning and disinfection policies and confirm an adequate use of PPE. These data are in keeping with very recent findings reporting that anterooms, corridors and postcleaning samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting that current protections and decontamination procedures are sufficient despite extensive contamination of inanimate surfaces in patients' room and toilet sites [8]. In any case, environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding suggests that the environment is indeed a potential medium of transmission[10]. Our study has limitations since virus viability was not shown and the sample size was small, due to difficulty to run more tests in a time of emergency. A more precise evaluation of the infectious potential of the environment could be undertaken by collecting droplets from patients' sputum on inanimate surfaces and measuring SARS-CoV-2 infectious potential in vitro as a function of time. However, the emergency of the outbreak required a fast assessment of the current situation. While the epidemic still shows no sign of ending, further studies are underway to more comprehensively determine the potential of the environment as a transmission medium.",
