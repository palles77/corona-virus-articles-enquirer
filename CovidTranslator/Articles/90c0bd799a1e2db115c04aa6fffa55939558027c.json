            "text": "Coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLPs or PLpro), such as the one encoded in the genome of the infectious Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, have multiple enzymatic activities that promote viral infection. PLpro acts as a protease and processes the large coronavirus polyprotein for virus replication. PLpro also functions as both a deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating (deISG) enzyme and removes ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins. Both DUB and deISG activities are implicated in suppressing innate immune responses; however, the precise role of each activity in this process is still unclear due in part to the difficulties in separating each activity. In this study, we determine the first structure of MERS PLpro in complex with the full-length human ISG15 to a resolution of 2.3 \u00c5. This structure and available structures of MERS PLpro-Ub complexes were used as molecular guides to design PLpro mutants that lack either or both DUB/deISG activities. We tested 13 different PLpro mutants for protease, DUB, and deISG activitites using fluorescence-based assays. Results show that we can selectively modulate DUB activity at amino acid positions 1649 and 1653 while mutation of Val1691 or His1652 of PLpro to a positive charged residue completely impairs both DUB/deISG activities. These mutant enzymes will provide new functional tools for delineating the importance of DUB versus deISG activity in virus-infected cells and may serve as potential candidates for attenuating the MERS virus in vivo for modified vaccine design efforts.",

            "text": "Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a 17-kDa antiviral ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein rapidly induced by type I interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infection (Durfee et al., 2010; Narasimhan et al., 2005) . ISG15 contains two Ubl-folds connected by a short interdomain linker or hinge region, and like other Ubl proteins is conjugated to target proteins through an isopeptide linkage. The conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins is known as ISGylation, which is one of the critical mechanisms necessary for its antiviral activity. ISGylation involves the consecutive catalytic function of three interferon-induced enzymes: the E1 activating enzyme Ube1L, the E2 conjugating enzyme UbCH8, followed by the E3 ligase human HERC5. Although the biochemical functions associated with ISGylation are still under investigation (Giannakopoulos et al., 2009; Lai et al., 2009 ), a number of reports have now shown that ISG15 conjugation targets a broad range of viruses in an attempt to inhibit viral replication, including influenza A and B virus, Sindbis virus, HIV-1, herpes simplex-1, and murine herpesvirus (Zhao et al., 2013) . One model for ISGylation involves a cotranslational process where HERC5 conjugates free ISG15 onto newly synthesized viral proteins at the ribosome in order to disrupt their viral function (Durfee et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "To help control ISG15 and its antiviral effector system, ISGylation can be reversed through the process of enzymatic deISGylation (deISG). For example, the host cell deISGylase ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) catalyzes the removal of ISG15 from target proteins in the cell. Recently, it was found that in humans, ISG15 deficiency actually increases resistance to viral infection in vivo. This is in contrast to what has been observed in mice, where ISG15 deficient mice are more susceptible to viral infection (Speer et al., 2016) . Reports suggest that in humans, free extracellular ISG15 may be required to stabilize USP18 levels for temporal regulation of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling, a mechanism that may not exist in mice (Hermann and Bogunovic, 2017; Speer et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015) . Speer et al. suggest that ISGylation may sequester free ISG15 early in infection to activate IFN, and only late in infection does USP18 become stabilized by free ISG15 to dampen IFN response. The role of free ISG15 and ISGylation in viral pathogenesis remains complex especially since free ISG15 is a negative regulator of IFN-signaling in humans (Perng and Lenschow, 2018) . Interestingly, viruses have been shown to modulate the system by upregulating the process of deISGylation and increasing pools of ISG15, which could impact IFN activation. The expression level of USP18 was found to be elevated in patients infected with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) suggesting the possibility that HCV can modulate host-derived machineries to promote viral infection (Chen et al., 2005) .",

The structure of PLpro with a full-length ISG15 protein has yet to be determined. An X-ray structure of MERS-CoV PLpro bound to the Cterminal domain of human ISG15 (C-ISG15) has been reported but it lacks the N-terminal domain which is known to be important in binding SARS PLpro (Daczkowski et al., 2017b) . The X-ray structure of mouse USP18 in complex with full-length mouse ISG15 has been determined, but USP18 has low sequence identity to PLpros. In addition, USP18 strictly recognizes ISG15 and has no recognition of Ub (Basters et al., 2017) .",

The wild-type pEVL8-his8-TEVp-MERS-CoV PLpro-\u0394Ubl2 plasmid was used as a template and primers were designed and synthesized using Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Correct mutations in the PLpro gene were confirmed by Sanger-based sequencing at the Purdue Genomics Core Sequencing Facility. Expression and purification of MERS-CoV PLpro mutant enzymes were performed by a modified procedure described above for the wild-type enzyme. For each of the mutant enzymes R1649A, H1652A, H1652F, V1691R, the pellets (12-15 g) from two 1 L cultures were harvested, and a two-day purification procedure was done using a Ni 2+ -charged, 5 mL HisTrap FF column. Dialysis of the pooled fractions obtained from the Ni Hi-trap column was performed against 1 L of buffer A for 16 h at 4\u00b0C using a 1:10 ratio of TEVp to PLpro in order to remove the Nterminal his-tag. The next day, the dialyzed sample was passed over the 5 mL Ni 2+ -charged HisTrap FF column, and similar to the procedure above for purification of wild-type MERS PLpro, the flow-through as well as the wash were combined and concentrated. Instead of using a desalting column, the final pool was buffer exchanged into storage buffer using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit (10 kDa MW cutoff) and then concentrated to~6-14 mg/mL. The final purified mutants were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen at 100 K and stored in the \u221280\u00b0C until their kinetic characterization.",

Substrate concentration was varied from 0.19 \u03bcM to 6 \u03bcM for ISG15-AMC and from 0.38 \u03bcM to 12 \u03bcM for Ub-AMC. The reactions were initiated with 1.7 nM PLpro in both assays. For mutant enzymes showing observable saturation at higher substrate concentrations, the initial reaction rates were measured in duplicate and the averaged rates were plotted as a function of substrate concentration. These data were then fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear regression and the enzyme kinetics module in SigmaPlot (version 12; Systat Software, Inc.). The kinetic parameters (k cat and K m ) resulting from the fit of the data as well as the calculated value of k cat /K m for each enzyme were tabulated. The Val1691Ser enzyme could not be saturated with either the Ub-AMC or the ISG15-AMC substrates up to the highest concentrations tested. Saturation was also not observed with the Thr1653Arg enzyme using Ub-AMC as the substrate. In these cases, the initial reaction rates were plotted as a function of substrate concentration and the data were fit to a line using linear regression and the program GraphPAD Prism6 for the determination of the apparent k cat / K m . 2.7. Ub-PA and ISG15-PA probe reactivity assays with wild-type and mutant MERS PLpro Probe reactivity assays were set-up at a 10 \u03bcL scale with pure MERS PLpro enzymes and PA probes. The reactivity of MERS PLpro wild-type was assessed with both PA probes at varying molar ratios. Ub-PA and human ISG15-PA were diluted in storage buffer containing fresh 10 mM DTT at final concentrations ranging from 5 to 25 \u03bcM and 25-100 \u03bcM, respectively. Each reaction was initiated with 5 \u03bcM MERS PLpro wildtype and allowed to react for 1 h at room temperature before quenching with 5X loading buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.02% bromophenyl blue, and fresh 400 mM DTT). The reactivity of MERS PLpro wild-type and mutants were evaluated at single molar ratios of 5 \u03bcM PLpro and either 25 \u03bcM Ub-PA (1:5 M ratio) and 100 \u03bcM ISG15-PA (1:20 M ratio), which were quenched at different time points (2, 5, 30 min) with loading buffer.

We therefore used the MERS-CoV PLpro-\u0394Ubl2 construct for the crystallization of the MERS-CoV PLpro-ISG15 complex, which was generated by reacting MERS-CoV PLpro-\u0394Ubl2 with the full-length, human ISG15 protein that was modified with a reactive, propargylamide (PA) group at its C-terminus. The PA group on ISG15 reacts with the catalytic cysteine and forms a covalent complex that can be readily purified (Supplementary Data: Fig. S1 ).

Unexpectedly, analysis of the electron density surrounding the Zn-finger motif for the PLpro-ISG15 complex crystals grown from 0.35 M citrate revealed no observable electron density for the Zn 2+ atom in the Zn-finger motif even though these crystals diffracted to the same resolution and grew in the same space group as the crystals grown at the two lower citrate concentrations (Supplementary Data: Fig. S2 ). At citrate concentrations of 0.2 M and 0.25 M, the Zn 2+ atom in the Zn-finger motif is clearly visible in electron density suggesting that the higher concentrations of citrate chelated the Zn 2+ and thereby depleted it from the Zn-finger. Therefore, the X-ray structure of the MERS-CoV PLpro-ISG15 complex grown from crystals at 0.2 M citrate was determined to a resolution of 2.3 \u00c5 (R work = 17.1% and R free = 21.5%).

The C-terminal domain of ISG15 (residues 82-156) and Ub (residues 1-75) superimpose quite well with a RMSD of 0.95 \u00c5 over 75 C\u03b1 atoms and the PLpro structures superimpose with a RMSD of 1.16 \u00c5 over 252 C\u03b1 atoms (Fig. 3A) . As expected, PLpro interacts with RLRGG residues at the Cterminus of both ISG15 and Ub substrates in a nearly identical manner by utilizing an intricate hydrogen-bonding network mainly composed of main-chain interactions (Fig. 3B-D) . These interactions were described previously for Ub (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014) with one minor difference in the orientation of Arg155 of ISG15 (equivalent to Arg74 of Ub) as shown in Fig. 3D . Arg155 of ISG15 corresponds to X in the P3 position of the LXGG substrate recognition sequence of PLpro. In the Ub-bound structure, the side-chain \u03b7-amino group of Arg74 is hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain carbonyl of Thr1755, which is found in the substrate-binding loop of MERS-CoV PLpro, while in ISG15, triethylene glycol (PGE) is bound in place of the Arg74 side-chain ( Fig. 3B and C) . Instead, Arg155 of ISG15 undergoes a~122\u00b0flip and interacts with the main-chain carbonyl of Pro1644 in the adjacent loop of the thumb domain between PLpro helix \u03b16-\u03b17 (secondary structure numbering based on (Lei et al., 2014) ). This alternative conformation of Arg155 was also observed in the structure of MERS-CoV PLpro in complex with only the C-terminal domain of ISG15 (Daczkowski et al., 2017b) . Therefore, there is observable flexibility for Arg in the P3 position in adopting different contacts with PLpro.",

However, structural differences are observed with residues surrounding Arg1649. In the Ub-bound complex, Arg42 of Ub positions itself to alleviate charge-charge repulsion with Arg1649 while in ISG15, Trp123 forms a more favorable interaction with Arg1649 by packing against its aliphatic chain. Another difference observed between ISG15 and Ub-bound structures is that Thr1653 only forms direct hydrogen-bond interactions with Gln49 (equivalent to Pro130 of ISG15) and Glu51 (equivalent to Glu132 of ISG15) in the Ub-bound complex whereas in the ISG15-bound complex Thr1653 forms no direct interactions (Fig. 3E, region #1) . Interestingly, in the structure of MERS-CoV with full-length ISG15, Glu132 of ISG15 does not appear to make strong contacts with PLpro. Though Glu132 was noted as a 'principle electrostatic interaction' in the structure of MERS-PLpro with N-terminally truncated ISG15, it forms a fairly weak electrostatic interaction (~3.8 \u00c5) with Lys1657 in the full-length ISG15 structure, which was only adopted in a single monomer. Thus, the presence of the N-terminal domain in full-length ISG15 influences interactions of the C-terminal domain of ISG15 with PLpro.",

As previously noted by Basters et al. for USP18, this region of ISG15 is conserved across different ISG15 species and was proposed to be a unique hydrophobic patch to ISG15 differing from the well-known hydrophobic patch of Ub, which is commonly utilized for recognition by a vast number of Ub-binding proteins (Basters et al., 2017; Komander and Rape, 2012) . Our observations and those of others collectively support the hypothesis that this hydrophobic region of ISG15 may be a canonical recognition region that is utilized in general by deISGylases to specifically recognize ISG15.",

We focused our mutagenesis on the following MERS-CoV PLpro residues; Arg1649, His1652, Thr1653, and Val1691, which all reside in the MERS-CoV PLpro SUb1 subsite. Mutants were designed based on two approaches: (i) alanine-scanning mutagenesis to completely remove interactions, and (ii) insertion of a bulky or charged residue to create steric hindrance, i.e. unfavorable Van der Waals overlap, or electrostatic repulsion to disrupt contacts. Additionally, we sought to engineer MERS-CoV PLpro to be more SARS-like, as Lys1550Phe and Arg1649Glu were mutated based on the equivalent residue found in SARS-CoV PLpro to decipher the residues that contribute to SARS-CoV PLpro enhanced turnover rate compared to MERS-CoV PLpro for different substrates (B\u00e1ez-Santos et al., 2014) .",

This result supports our prediction that the potential hydrogen bond observed after data refinement between Lys1550 of PLpro and Gln34 of ISG15 is unlikely and not important for ISG15 recognition. This observation stands in stark contrast to SARS-CoV PLpro that has two ubiquitin recognition sites (SUb1 and SUb2) for ISG15 and K48-linked diUb chains (B\u00e9k\u00e9s et al., 2016; Ratia et al., 2014) .

Our results indicate that MERS-CoV PLpro does not possess an equivalent SUb2 subsite.",

Adding a negatively charged aspartate residue at this position was shown to selectively disrupt the recognition of ISG15-AMC by MERS PLpro while the ability to recognize and hydrolyze Ub-AMC was maintained (Daczkowski et al., 2017b ). The aspartate is likely able to make a salt bridge with Arg42 of Ub while in ISG15, the hydrophobic pocket cannot accommodate this charged residue. In contrast, substituting a positively charged arginine or lysine at this position severely impairs both activities of PLpro. For example, Val1691Arg results in a 32-fold reduction in ISG15-AMC hydrolysis and nearly a 2000-fold reduction in Ub-AMC hydrolysis. Bailey-Elkin et al. previously showed that Val1691Arg completely abolishes the ability of PLpro to antagonize IFN, as it no longer suppressed the IFN-\u03b2 promoter in cells and mimicked the catalytically dead enzyme (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014) . The loss of IFN antagonism was attributed to loss of DUB activity but deISG activity was not determined.",

            "text": "Based on our results, the loss of IFN antagonism could be due to either the loss of either DUB or deISG activity or both. In general, inserting a negatively or positively charged residue into the hydrophobic pocket of ISG15 is found not to be favored. In the case of binding Ub, only a positive charge is not permitted, as this would introduce chargecharge repulsion with Arg42 of Ub. To delineate if the observed effects of an insertion of an arginine at position 1691 was simply due to a bulk or steric overlap effect, Val1691 was also mutated to a phenylalanine. Surprisingly, Val1691Phe showed a 13-fold increase in the k cat value for Ub-AMC while other activities were similar to the wild-type. Structurally, Phe1691 would allow for an additional \u03c0-cation interaction with Arg42 of Ub. On the other hand, engineering a more conservative mutation i.e. a small polar serine at the Val1691 position only reduced the ISG15-AMC efficiency (6.2-fold based on the k app value) while Ub-AMC efficiency was less affected. TheVal1691Ser mutant did not reach saturation for either Ub-AMC or ISG15-AMC; the loss in efficiency was primarily due to an increase in K m for ISG15 ( Fig. 4B and Table 2 ). The selectivity of Val1691Ser mutant towards ISG15-AMC decreased by 3.8-fold compared to the wild-type and is the only mutant that has similar catalysis for both substrates. This more conservative mutation also restored RLRGG-AMC activity back to that of the wildtype. We suggest that position 1691 in PLpro is critical for substrate recognition, and based on the amino acid substitution at position 1691, it is possible to selectively modulate PLpro deISG (Val1691Asp, Val1691Ser) or DUB (Val1691Phe) activities or disrupt both DUB/ deISG activities simultaneously (Val1691Arg, Val1691Lys).",

            "text": "His1652Ala, which is structurally adjacent to that of Val1691, did not significantly alter the enzymatic profile of MERS-CoV PLpro in our initial screening (Fig. 4A) . We originally thought that the hydrophobic contacts and water-mediated interactions made by His1652 were not significant, but instead of performing alanine scanning, we sought to disrupt MERS-CoV PLpro activity by inserting a charged and bulky residue at this position as done with Val1691. Excitingly, mutation of the His1652 to an arginine drastically impaired both PLpro DUB/deISG activities by~300-400-fold, a similar trend to the Val1691Arg and Val1691Lys mutants. In fact, to observe hydrolysis of these substrates, a higher concentration of enzyme was required and nearly approached the concentration of substrate in the assay. His1652Arg also exhibited a 4-fold reduction in RLRGG-AMC activity. In general, placing a bulky and charged residue in this region of PLpro does affect the active site functionality to a certain degree. We also analyzed if the water-mediated contacts involving His1652 were important by mutating this residue to a phenylalanine, which is incapable of hydrogen bonding. His1652Phe showed only a 1.7-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency for both ISG15-AMC and Ub-AMC. Interestingly, His1652Phe had a lower K m value than wild-type for Ub-AMC (1.8 \u03bcM versus 16.6 \u03bcM) suggesting a 9-fold increase in binding affinity for this substrate, but there was also a 5.5-fold decrease in k cat (Fig. 4D and Table 2 ). Overall, the net change was an increase in the catalytic efficiency for Ub-AMC about 2-fold over that for the wild-type enzyme. We observed a similar trend for Val1691Phe catalysis towards ISG15-AMC, but it was not as pronounced ( Fig. 4B and Table 2 ). Overall, PLpro catalytic activity is more sensitive to having a positively charged amino acid at position 1652 rather than a smaller or bulky hydrophobic residue. To further evaluate the DUB/deISG deficiencies of the His1652Arg, Val1691Arg, and Val1691Lys mutants, their ability to react and form a covalent modification with Ub-PA and ISG15-PA were tested. First, the optimal molar ratio required for complete conversion to the covalent adduct was determined using the MERS PLpro wild-type. Within a 1 h incubation reaction, MERS PLpro-wild-type was completely modified by Ub-PA and ISG15-PA at a 1:5 ratio and 1:20 ratio, respectively (Fig. 5A) . These molar ratios were then used to analyze the reactivity of the mutants at different time points. While wild-type MERS PLpro was capable of being converted fully to complexes with both Ub-PA and ISG15-PA within a short 2 min incubation, all three mutants showed impaired reactivity at the earlier time points (Fig. 5B and C). All mutants still showed unreacted PLpro at the 5 min incubation with ISG15-PA. For the His1652Arg and Val1691Lys mutants, impaired reactivity at 5 min was also observed with Ub-PA, as a portion of complex was converted ( Fig. 5B and C) . For Val1691Arg, even after a 30 min prolonged incubation, unreacted PLpro was still visible on the gel while the dominant band was complex with the other mutants and wild-type ( Fig. 5B and C) . This single mutation elicited a similar defect in the reaction with Ub-PA as that of USP18 IBB\u22121\u2212USP7 with ISG15-PA, which contained four mutations in the ISG15-binding box 1 (IBB-1) (Basters et al., 2017) . From these data, all three mutants are impaired for Ub/ ISG15-PA reactivity. Consistent with our kinetic data, the Val1691Arg mutation may target DUB activity more so than deISG activity, and it shows a striking defect in Ub-PA reactivity.",

In addition, Thr1653Arg significantly inhibits PLpro-mediated IFN-antagonism in cells, but not quite to the extent of a Val1691Arg mutant (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014) . From the kinetic studies presented in Fig. 4D , the Thr1653Arg mutant cannot be saturated with the Ub-AMC substrate over the concentration ranges tested. Thr1653Arg exhibits a 4.1-fold reduction in Ub-AMC catalytic efficiency compared to the wildtype and only a small reduction in ISG15-AMC activity (Table 2 ).

This is a surprising observation due to the fact that arginine likely interacts with the P5 arginine in the RLRGG motif of all three substrates. It is possible that removing the stacked guanidinium group interaction alleviates any electrostatic repulsion with Arg42 in Ub so that Ub is more easily accommodated. Conversely, since there is no extra charge at the equivalent Arg42 position in ISG15, the charged guanidinium groups are more properly balanced by negatively charged residues, such as Asp1645 and interacting waters.

These mutants can now be used as functional tools to probe for the individual contributions of DUB and deISG activity to MERS-CoV replication and pathogenesis. It would be interesting to investigate whether partial or complete knockdown of both DUB/deISG activities or abolishing only one activity of PLpro is necessary to efficiently inhibit host cell antagonism and attenuate the MERS virus. Since there are additional IFN antagonists in the CoV genome, additional mutations targeting other viral proteins may be required.",

Since these mutations do not exist in nature, it is possible that a DUB hyperactive virus may be nonviable or cannot be recovered using a reverse genetics system. Alternatively, this virus may reach a steady-state through reversion or mutation to survive and continue to replicate in the host population. More studies that evaluate these PLpro mutants in animal models are needed to answer these important biological questions and to explore the potential for using such mutants for the design and development of live-attenuated vaccines.",

MERS-CoV PLpro only actively engages with the C-terminal domain of ISG15 utilizing one SUb1 subsite, in contrast to SARS-CoV PLpro that appears to engage with the N-terminus of ISG15 using a second SUb2 subsite. MERS-CoV PLpro recognizes a hydrophobic surface on ISG15 that is distinct from the hydrophobic patch on Ub. Insertion of a charged residue into PLpro that contacts the hydrophobic region in ISG15 decreases specificity. Selectively disrupting or enhancing the DUB activity of PLpro can be accomplished by inserting a positive charge at position 1653 or removing the charge of Arg1649, respectively. Thr1653Arg will be a useful mutation for probing the role of DUB activity in MERS pathogenesis. Mutation of either His1652 or Val1691 to a positive charged residue completely impairs both DUB and deISG activities making either mutant useful for probing the contribution of both activities. DUB/ deISG deficient mutants, His1652Arg, Val1691Lys, and Val1691Arg characterized in this study will be good candidates for investigating the potential for attenuating the MERS virus and may be useful for liveattenuated vaccine design.
