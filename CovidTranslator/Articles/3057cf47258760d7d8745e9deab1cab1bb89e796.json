For example, the normal nasal bacterial flora may include Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and aerobic coryne bacteria ('diphtheroids'). Some people carry meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in their nose, which can cause disease (Ch. 21). Bacterial infection caused by a foreign body introduced into the nose of a child (e.g. a small toy) is a well-recognized cause of halitosis, as are tonsillitis and sinusitis. The nasopharyngeal bacterial flora may include nonencapsulated or non-virulent strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, which may cause meningitis. Pharyngitis can be caused by group A streptococci (and can rarely lead to rheumatic fever and occasionally rheumatic carditis; Ch. 5) or can be caused by Epstein-Barr virus (Ch. 21).",

There can be significant difficulties in management of the airway for anaesthesia in children under the age of 5 years, particularly in young infants and in those with feeding difficulties, bilateral clefts and/or retrognathia. Patients with mandibular dysostoses and those requiring midface advancement (Le Fort II osteotomy) have the greatest problems. Difficulties are common in Pierre Robin, Treacher Collins and Goldenhar syndromes, and the cervical spine may be problematic in Klippel-Feil syndrome. The laryngeal mask has been recommended as a guide to fibreoptic endoscopic intubation. Aesthetics is a major issue for parents (Fig. 14.5) . One of the problems for the child is feeding; a Rosti bottle with Gummi teat often helps.",

In general, when the lip alone is cleft, initial cosmetic repair is carried out at about 3-6 months of age, though earlier operations are becoming popular. Many repair CLP within the first few days of life since, after repair, the appearance is dramatically improved, feeding difficulties are significantly minimized and speech develops better. If the palatal defect is too wide, it can be repaired 3 months later to allow for sufficient palatal growth. In any event, CP is now usually repaired before the child speaks, between 6 and 18 months, and typically at 6-12 months of age.",
