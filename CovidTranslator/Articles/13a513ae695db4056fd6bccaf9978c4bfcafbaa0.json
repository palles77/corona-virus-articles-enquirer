            "text": "Rabbits have a unique digestive physiology. As discussed in Chapter 15, rabbits are herbivores, but their digestive strategy differs from those of other hindgut or cecal fermenters (e.g., horses, guinea pigs) and ruminants. The rabbit's cecum and colon have a well-developed mechanism for selective retention of fine particles and solutes. The result is efficient fermentation of this portion of the diet but remarkably low digestibility of the crude fiber fraction of the diet. The rapid digestive transit allows a high feed intake, increasing the total amount of energy extracted and minimizing the quantity of fiber stored. 11 Digesta is separated in the colon in a process of selective retention of fluid and small particles. Normal peristaltic movements propel the larger, less dense fiber particles through the colon, while contractions of the haustra of the colon move the fluid and small particles (the higher density components) retrograde to the cecum. Small particles and fluid are retained in the cecum, allowing for extensive fermentation. Cecal contents are expelled at intervals and consumed directly from the anus (cecotrophy). 21, 40 ",

Plant cell walls can be synthesized but not degraded by the plant cell; animal digestive enzymes cannot degrade these structures either. Only bacteria and some fungi have enzymes to degrade these substances, and the use of this material as food by herbivores depends on a symbiotic association with gastrointestinal organisms with the requisite ability to degrade plant structural matter. The storage carbohydrate starch differs from structural cellulose only in the stereochemical linkage of the glucose units (a and b, respectively). 2 Resistance to digestion arises from several features of the chemical structure. Occurrence of linkages for which no animal enzyme is secreted allows the possibility of fermentation. Microbial enzymes exist that will hydrolyze most glycosidic linkages occurring in plant walls. Polysaccharides will be fermented if the bond is accessible to the enzyme. The galactans that occur in many legumes and their seeds are resistant to animal digestive enzymes but are storage compounds relative to the plant and thus form an exception to the rule that most resistant carbohydrates are in the fibrous elements. Galactans are rapidly fermented and are responsible for flatus. Cellulose and hemicellulose are fermentable to some extent by microorganisms. Cellulose is less digestible than is hemicellulose. The main difference between legumes, such as alfalfa, and grasses is the much higher amount of hemicellulose of different types of grass. 42 Lignin is the main noncarbohydrate component of plant fiber and offers another kind of resistance to biologic degradation. Lignin is an aromatic polymer containing a condensed, continuous carbon-to-carbon linkage system of bonding that offers no possibility of hydrolytic cleavage.",

The beneficial effect is associated with the indigestible component lignin, commonly known as fiber. The digestible carbohydrate sources do not afford the same protection. Fiber stimulates cecocolic motility, either directly or by a distention effect of the bulk. Conversely, diets low in fiber cause cecocolic hypomotility, which predisposes rabbits to abnormal cecal fermentation and prolonged retention of digesta in the cecum; they also stimulate volatile fatty acid production, alter pH and substrate concentrations, and ultimately produce changes in cecal microflora. Other effects of fiber consumption are indirect. High-fiber diets have a low level of available carbohydrate and thus decrease the risk of enterotoxemia caused by carbohydrate overload of the hindgut. Carbohydrates provide an environment in which pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Clostridium species proliferate.

This group of rabbits may develop enterotoxemia from simple exposure to C. spiroforme. This is likely because these young rabbits have an undeveloped population of normal gastrointestinal flora and a high gastric pH, which allows the proliferation of C. spiroforme. Adult rabbits are more resistant and generally require some dietary, environmental, or other stress for the dysbiotic state to be induced and growth of the bacteria allowed. Rapid multiplication of C. spiroforme results in significant alteration of the rabbit's normal cecal flora.

EPEC strains do not express the high levels of shiga toxin that are characteristic of EHEC strains, but all AEEC strains have a common genetic code to produce factors necessary to produce attaching and effacing lesions.

The disease is most often characterized as an acute diarrhea disease of rabbits 2 to 4 months of age (weanlings). Proliferative enteritis (PE) or enteropathy is an enteric disease that develops in many animals. Much of the literature focuses on the disease in swine and hamsters. In addition, PE has been reported in rats and guinea pigs; ungulates other than swine, including white-tailed deer, sheep, and horses; carnivores, including arctic foxes, dogs, ferrets, and nonhuman primates; and birds (ratites). The disease is not an important problem in these other species. 41 Histologic findings in these cases most often show a proliferative ileitis, with or without proliferative colitis, characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and mucosal inflammation. Similar disease in pigs and ferrets has been shown to be caused by a similar but distinctively different bacterium, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. 25, 35 Treatment of L. intracellularis in rabbits is challenging. Antibiotics used to treat L. intracellularis in other species include those of the macrolide family (e.g., tylocin, erythromycin, and lincomycin). These antibiotics are not recommended for use in rabbits. Chloramphenicol is generally efficacious and is administered at 30-50 mg/kg PO, SC q12h for 7 to 14 days. Florfenicol (NuFlor, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp., Union, NJ) is a new antibiotic that may be useful as an antimicrobial agent in rabbits, but its efficacy and potential side effects in this species need to be evaluated.",

More often, the intestinal wall is edematous, with areas of necrosis in the mucosa of the proximal colon. Treatment is palliative once clinical signs have been observed. The intracellular location of the bacteria may contribute to the difficulty in treating affected animals. If exposed animals are treated early (if they are isolated from affected animals, good hygiene is promoted, and supportive care and a high fiber diet are provided), they may not develop the disease.

Severe anorexia, dehydration, and mucoid or greenish-yellow watery diarrhea have been reported. Rabbits between 30 and 80 days of age are most often affected. The mortality rate in young rabbits with naturally occurring infections may be as high as 80%.

Although these two syndromes are very similar, European brown hare syndrome is associated with diarrhea and has now been shown to be caused by a different calicivirus. RCD was first identified in China in angora rabbits imported from Europe in 1984. Since then, RCD has been reported in parts of Asia and Europe, including the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Italy, Korea, and Spain. Investigations suggest the disease spread from country to country through shipments of contaminated rabbit meat and infected live rabbits. The first report of RCD in the western hemisphere was in 1988, when the disease was detected in domestic rabbits in the Mexico City area. The outbreak was traced to a shipment of 18 metric tons of frozen rabbit carcasses from China that had been delivered to a supermarket chain outside Mexico City. In 1989, the Mexican government began a control and eradication program that included quarantine of infected farms; prohibition of movement or sale of rabbits, voluntary destruction of diseased rabbits; and cleaning, disinfecting, and repopulating premises after a 2month waiting period. The campaign was successful. Mexico is the only country to succeed in eradicating RCD.",

The virus enters the rabbit through the conjunctiva, nasal passages, or traumatized tissue. The course of the disease is acute, with the duration of incubation only 1 to 2 days. RCD is highly infectious and has traditionally been associated with both high morbidity rates (70%-80%) and high mortality rates (100%). The number of rabbits affected during outbreaks peaks in 2 to 3 days, and the disease course may last only 7 to 13 days. Initially, affected rabbits are febrile and show signs of depression, lethargy, and anorexia. Some may show signs of tachypnea, cyanosis, abdominal distention, and constipation or diarrhea. At the end stage of the disease, the rabbit becomes hypothermic and recumbent and may have convulsions or epistaxis. Because of the rapid course of the disease, signs may not be noticed, and the affected rabbit is found dead. Surviving rabbits exhibit depression, anorexia, and fever that may last for 2 to 3 days.",

Infection is by ingestion of sporulated oocysts. Although rabbits are cecotrophic, it is generally accepted that cecotrophs eaten from the anus do not contain infectious oocysts. Clinical signs vary widely depending on the age of the rabbit, the organism involved, the degree of infection (i.e., the number of oocysts ingested), and the relative susceptibility of the animal (determined by factors such as age, stress, and diet). Infections are usually not apparent. Clinical signs are most often seen in young rabbits. Weight loss, mild intermittent to severe diarrhea that may contain mucus or blood, and dehydration may be observed. Animals with severe diarrhea may develop intussusception. Death most often is attributed to dehydration and secondary bacterial infections. Postmortem examination reveals lesions in the small or large intestine, depending on the agent involved. The epithelium of the intestine may be ulcerated. The presence of the organism (or organisms) in fecal samples or scrapings of the intestine supports a presumptive diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis is based on histologic findings. Numerous agents have been used to prevent and treat intestinal and hepatic coccidiosis. Sulfa drugs appear to be the most effective. The addition of sulfadimethoxine to the diet in an amount to ensure intake of 75 mg/kg for 7 days or 0.02% sulfamerazine sodium to the drinking water is safe and efficacious. 39 In my experience, sulfadimethoxine (15 mg/kg PO q12h for 10 days) and trimethoprim-sulfa combinations (30 mg/kg q12h PO for 10 days) have similarly proved effective. Amprolium 9.6% in drinking water (0.5 mL per 500 mL) also is effective. The major role of chemotherapeutic agents may be limiting multiplication until immunity develops. Once a rabbit is infected, it is rare for it to show clinical signs of coccidiosis, and immunity resulting from mild infections may be lifelong. 39 Research studies have shown that suckling rabbits vaccinated orally or with a spray dispersion into the nest box with a precocious line of E. magna were protected from challenge. 14, 18 Prevention depends on keeping rabbits in hygienic conditions and avoiding infected feces or feces-contaminated food and water.",

            "text": "Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites of fungi, produced primarily by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. When feed that contains aflatoxins is ingested, a complex metabolic pathway is created for removing this toxin from the body. There are four different aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus; AFB 1 , B 2 , G 1 , and G 2 , but the aflatoxin of main concern is aflatoxin B 1 because of its role in carcinogenesis. In its natural state, aflatoxin B 1 is not toxigenic. It becomes harmful when it enters the body and is recognized as a foreign substance and is metabolized initially to B8,9epoxide by cytochrome P450 subfamilies and specific isoforms. A major detoxification pathway that the body uses is the conjugation of B8,9-epoxide with glutathione. This process is catalyzed by glutathione-S-transferase. Aflatoxin B 1 -8,9-epoxide and AFB 2a are intermediates of the most active metabolite, AFB-dihydrodiol. The production of AFB-dihydrodiol is an attempt made by the body at detoxification. This pathway is used to a lesser extent. The epoxide is converted into a dihydrodiol because of the actions of epoxide hydrolase. Aflatoxin B-dihydrodiol is further metabolized to form AFM 1 , AFQ 1 , and AFP 1 , which form glucuronides and sulfate conjugates that are excreted in the urine and feces. 10 The LD 50 for aflatoxins in rabbits is among the lowest for any species studied. 13 Levels of aflatoxin B 1 greater than 100 ppm in the diet of rabbits have been shown to be associated with morbidity and death. 33 In one outbreak of aflatoxicosis in angora rabbits, affected animals had anorexia, dullness, and weight loss followed by jaundice in terminal stages. Death occurred within 3 to 4 days of the appearance of clinical signs. On postmortem examination, livers were moderately to severely congested, icteric, and were hard to cut. Gallbladders were distended and had inspissated bile. Liver sections showed degenerative changes of hepatic cells along with dilatation and engorgement of sinusoids. Bile ducts had mild to severe periportal fibrosis. Focal areas of pseudolobulation and regenerative foci were also predominant. The level of aflatoxin B 1 in feed samples from various farms submitted at the time of the investigation varied from 90 to 540 mg aflatoxin B 1 /kg of feed. Withdrawal of feed and supplementary therapy resulted in gradual disappearance of signs and death. 29 ",
