A pair of upstream and downstream primers was used to amplify M-coding fragments via PCR-based overlap extension mutagenesis (36) . Two primers were used to introduce a FLAG epitope tag to the M carboxyl terminus, with the SARS-CoV M expression vector serving as a template: the 5\u0408-GTCTGAGCA-GTACTCGTTGCTG-3\u0408 forward primer (referred to as the N primer) and the 5\u0408-ATCGGATCCTCACTTGTCGTCGTC-CTTGTAGTCCTGCACCAGCAGGGCGATGTT-3\u0408 reverse primer (containing a flanking BamHI restriction site and FLAG tag-coding nucleotides). Purified PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRV and ligated into the SARS-CoV M expression vector. When constructing a series of M-DsRed fusion expression vectors, the N primer served as the forward primer, using the M sequence as a template. Primers used to make the designated constructs were M-DsRed, 5\u0408-GCGGAT-CCTGCACCAGCAGGGCGATG-3\u0408; M50-DsRed, 5\u0408-CGGG-ATCCAGCTTGATGATGTACAG-3\u0408; M75-DsRed, 5\u0408-CGG-GATCCACCCAGTTGATCCTGTACAC-3\u0408; and M100-DsRed, 5\u0408-CGGGATCCCTGAAGCTGGCCACGAAGTA-3\u0408.

Harvested culture supernatants were pelleted through 20% sucrose cushion and subjected to Western blot analysis. Consistent with the previous results (28, 40) , both M and N were readily detected in the medium of cotransfected cells (Fig. 1, lane 5) . Notably, substantial amounts of M and M-FLAG were present in the medium samples without coexpressed N (lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that the SARS-CoV M is capable of release from cells in the absence of other viral components. However, M-FLAG was apparently incapable of efficient association with N, seeing that N was barely detectable in medium (Fig. 1, lane 6 ). This may be due to the disruption of M-N interaction by FLAG tagged carboxylterminally. This explanation is compatible with studies demonstrating M carboxyl-terminal region involvement in M-N interaction in SARS-CoV (28, 41) , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (14) , and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (26) . To test whether released M proteins were membrane-enveloped, we treated concentrated supernatants from M-expressing cells with protease in the presence or absence of nonionic detergent. Our results indicate that extracellular M became undetectable following treatment with protease and Triton X-100 (data not shown), suggesting that released M proteins were enveloped in lipid bilayers.",

            "text": "Glycosylation, Lipid Rafts, and RNA Are Not Required or Involved in the Self-assembly and Release of M Proteins-Because M protein contains a single N-glycosylation site at the fourth amino acid residue Asn (35), we tested whether glycosylation is required for M release. Cells were transfected with a glycosylation-defective M expression vector in which Asn-4 was replaced by Gln. We also tried to determine whether SARS-CoV VLP assembly and release involves a cholesterol-enriched lipid raft-like membrane domain by treating transfectants with the cholesterol-depletion chemical M\u2424CD. Our results indicate that released levels of M, either expressed alone or coexpressed with N, were not significantly affected by blocking glycosylation (data not shown). Surprisingly, quantities of released M increased markedly following M\u2424CD treatment (Fig. 3A) . However, virus production by HIV-1, whose assembly and budding is lipid raft-dependent, was noticeably reduced by M\u2424CD (Fig. 3B, lane 8) , a finding that is consistent with a previous report (42) . Similar results were observed across several independent experiments. Increased quantities of released M as a result of cytolysis were minimal (if any), because no gross cytotoxicity was observed. Furthermore, in the absence of M coexpression, N was undetectable in medium following M\u2424CD treatment (data not shown), supporting the proposition that increased M release is not a result of cytolysis. Because M particles released from M\u2424CD-treated cells may be assembled differently than M particles from control cells, we therefore performed additional experiments to determine whether M released from M\u2424CD-treated cells are assembled in particulate form similar to M from control cells. We centrifuged M-containing supernatants from M\u2424CD-treated or untreated cells through a 20% sucrose cushion. Aliquots of the resuspended pellets were studied using a TEM. Remaining resuspensions were centrifuged with M-FLAG particles (concentrated from the supernatants of M-FLAG-expressing cells and serving as a control for sampling bias from gradient to gradient) through the same iodixanol gradient. Our results indicate that the majority of M from either M\u2424CD-treated or untreated cells co-sedimented with M-FLAG at the same fraction (fraction 4), with a buoyant density between 1.12 and 1.13 g/ml (Fig. 3C) . Similar results were observed in repeat independent experiments. Our TEM observations indicate that M particles released from M\u2424CD-treated cells retain membrane integrity and exhibit spherical morphology that is barely distinguishable from the M particles released from untreated cells (data not shown). This is in agreement with previous reports indicating that M\u2424CD treatment does not significantly affect virion morphology (43, 44). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a failure to detect membrane-damaged M particles may be due to particle instability. It is likely that the fragility of M particles (lacking other viral components such as genomic RNA or the viral structural proteins S, E, and N) may have caused them to break up following their release from M\u2424CD-treated cells, making membrane-defective M particles (if any) barely detectable in pellets. Overall, our results suggest that M recovered from M\u2424CD-treated cells are assembled in the same manner as M from control cells and that lipid rafts are not required for M self-assembly and release. Further studies are required to determine the underlying molecular basis of the M\u2424CD enhancement effect on M release.",

            "text": "Based on previous studies suggesting that M protein in coronaviruses also possesses an RNA-binding property (45, 46) , we looked at whether the presence of RNA is required for SARS-CoV M-M and/or M-N interaction. M or N was coexpressed with M-FLAG or GST-N, the latter with GST tagged at the N amino terminus. M or N association with M-FLAG or GST-N was assessed by coimmunoprecipitation or a GST pulldown assay in the presence or absence of RNase. We previously reported that (a) N is capable of undergoing self-association, and (b) its association with human APOBEC3G (hA3G) is RNAdependent (38, 40) . GST-N association with hA3G served as a control. We observed that equivalent amounts of M were coprecipitated with M-FLAG (Fig. 3D, lane 15 ) under an RNase treatment condition of either significantly reduced levels of copulled-down N (Fig. 3D, lane 13) , or the elimination or nearelimination of co-pulled-down hA3G (Fig. 3E, lane 5) . The RNase treatment did not significantly impact M association with GST-N (Fig. 3, D and E) . GST by itself was not capable of pulling down M, N, or hA3G (data not shown). To further confirm that RNA is not essential for M-N interaction, we performed an additional coimmunoprecipitation experiment using an M expression vector carrying an amino-terminal HA tag (HA-M). The result indicates that N was still capable of associating with M when treated with RNase (Fig. 3F, lane 12) . In contrast, RNase treatment abrogates N association with hA3G (lane 11), which is consistent with the GST pulldown assay results (Fig. 3E) . Together, these findings suggest that the presence of RNA is not necessary for M-M or M-N interaction, but it does stimulate efficient N-N interaction.",

We found that M-\u2424gal is also capable of release into medium, although less efficiently than M (data not shown). Equilibrium centrifugation analysis indicates that the majority of M-\u2424gal was sedimented at fraction 6 with an iodixanol density of 1.15 g/ml, higher than that of M particles in the same gradient (Fig. 4A ). M and M-\u2424gal coexpression resulted in peaking M and M-\u2424gal release at the same fraction and with a density similar to that of M-\u2424gal (Fig. 4B) , suggesting efficient interaction between the two molecules. The higher density of M-\u2424gal particles compared with M particles may be explained, at least in part, by their higher molecular weight. Another possible explanation is that the fused \u2424-gal protein induced a global conformational change, resulting in M-\u2424gal molecules packed in a more compact manner. Although this chimeric particle assembly system might provide a convenient assay with which to determine required M sequence bound- aries for M-M interaction, MGB signals were often barely detectable following iodixanol density gradient fractionation. We therefore used a coimmunoprecipitation experiment to map the domain involved in M self-association. M immunoprecipitation demonstrated interaction with MGB molecules retaining the M transmembrane domains (Fig. 4D, lanes 14 and  16 -18) . Similar results were observed when the precleared lysates of individually expressed M-FLAG and MGB were mixed prior to immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These data suggest that efficient M multimerization is largely dependent on the triple transmembrane-domain region. Specifically, amino-terminal 50 residues encompassing the first transmembrane domain were found to be sufficient for effective M-M interaction.",

According to our results, \u03f370% of the total cellular M or M-\u2424gal were membrane-associated (Fig. 5) ; M50-, M75-, and M100-\u2424gal exhibited membrane-binding capacities comparable to or higher than that of M-\u2424gal. Although M100-\u2424gal and M50-\u2424gal are present in higher percentages compared with M-\u2424gal and M, the differences are not statistically significant. In contrast, \u03fd10% of total M13-or M160-\u2424gal were membrane-bound. M101-\u2424gal was moderately defective in membrane binding (i.e. \u03fd50% of total cellular M101-\u2424gal was membrane-associated). To confirm the presence of lipid membrane, we quantified cholesterol (a major membrane lipid component) in each isolated fraction. The majority of cholesterol was found in the 10 -65% sucrose interface (Fig. 5B) , corresponding to the peak fraction (fraction 3) of both M and caveolin-1, a known raft-associated membrane protein (47) . These results suggest that the amino-terminal 50 residues bearing the first transmembrane domain are sufficient for conferring efficient membrane binding and indicate a strong correlation between MGB multimerization efficiency and membrane binding capacity. Additionally, we observed a correlation between MGB release efficiency and membrane-binding capacity; in other words, MGB fusion proteins considered defective in membrane binding (M13-, M101-, and M160-\u2424gal) are inefficiently released (data not shown).",

M-DsRed or M-EGFP transfectants (fixed or unfixed) showed fluorescent staining patterns indistinguishable from those of M transfectants (Fig. 6, C-F and L) . At 4 h post-transfection, M-EGFP was mostly found in the perinuclear area and colocalized with the DsRed-Golgi marker (Fig. 6, G-I) . Peripheral punctate fluorescence became more pronounced 24 h post-transfection. Similar results were also observed in Vero-E6 (Fig. 6J ) and 293T cells (data not shown).

We reasoned that M-EGFP might dominantly affect DsRed subcellular distribution patterns; although we could not exclude the possibility of DsRed fusion localization signals confounding assay results. As expected, colocalization between M-DsRed and M-EGFP was readily observed in the perinuclear and plasma membrane areas (Fig. 7 In contrast, M101-DsRed (localized exclusively around cell nuclei when expressed alone) localized with coexpressed M-EGFP to plasma membrane besides the perinuclear area ( Fig. 6Q versus Fig. 7, P-R) . Although the M160-DsRed transfectants expressed a diffuse intracellular fluorescence pattern, significant peripheral punctate fluorescence was only observed in cells cotransfected with M-EGFP (Fig. 6R versus Fig. 7, S-U) . These data suggest that M-EGFP can influence the distribution pattern of M101-DsREd and M160-DsRed, presumably through an interaction involving the M carboxyl-terminal region.

Cells expressing a glycosylation-defective M (N4Q) exhibited an immunofluorescence staining pattern indistinguishable from that of wt transfectants (data not shown), suggesting that glycosylation is not required for M plasma membrane targeting. Glycosylation is also dispensable for M self-association and release, as N4Q mutant quantities detected in the medium were near the level displayed by wt M (data not shown). This agrees with a previous report that the glycosylation of coronavirus M is not essential for MHV VLP assembly (25) . Furthermore, the negative effect of the cholesterol-depletion agent M\u2424CD on the release of M-associated particles was virtually zero (Fig. 3A) . This finding is compatible with reports that lipid rafts are required for virus entry but not for virus release in MHV (48) and SARS-CoV (49) . Although the presence of RNA is necessary for efficient N-N interaction, we found that M-M or M-N interaction does not require RNA (Fig. 3) . RNA-independent SARS-CoV M-N interaction is similar to MHV M-N interaction (13) . Despite being capable of multimerization, SARS-CoV N was barely detectable in medium pellets when M plus N VLPs were pretreated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (data not shown), suggesting that the formation of high order N multimers depends on membrane association through N-M interaction. The combination of M plus N, or of M plus M-\u2424gal, resulted in the formation of more dense particles compared with those formed by M alone ( Figs. 2 and 4) .

In addition, an effective association was noted between M50-\u2424gal and M-FLAG (Fig. 4D) , and intracellular M50-DsRed primarily colocalized with a Golgi marker (data not shown). These data suggest that the second and third transmembrane domains are dispensable for SARS-CoV M Golgi retention, membrane binding, and self-association. In the case of infectious bronchitis virus, the first transmembrane domain is both necessary and sufficient for M localization in the Golgi region (8, (57) (58) (59) . However, all three transmembrane domains are required for MHV M localization to the Golgi compartment (60, 61) .",

This finding differs from those in previous MHV M-M interaction studies demonstrating that the removal of all three transmembrane domains eliminates M-M interaction ability (62) . Surprisingly, neither M50-nor M75-DsRed effectively colocalized with M-EGFP on plasma membrane (Fig.  7) , despite carrying the efficient M-M interaction domain (Fig.  4D ). One possible explanation is that the Golgi retention signal contained within M amino-terminal 50 codons becomes the dominant trafficking determinant once the third transmembrane domain is removed. However, both M101-and M160-\u2424gal are incapable of coprecipitation with M (Fig. 4D) , implying a membrane association requirement for efficient M-M interaction.",
