Eleven profiles of pathogen combination were observed. The most frequently encountered pathogen combinations were TCoV-Li, followed by TCoV-TAstV-2-Li, TCoV-TastV-2. Only TCoV was detected as the sole pathogen in three flocks. Eight and 19 flocks of the 22 were positive for TAstV-2 and TCoV, respectively. Six were positive for Salmonella spp. and L. intracellularis was detected in 12 turkey flocks. Reovirus and HEV were not detected in this survey. These results throw new light on the multiple etiology of enteritis in turkeys. The implications of these findings and their correlation with the clinical signs are comprehensively discussed, illustrating the complexity of the enteric diseases.",

Most research has focused on turkey astroviruses (TAstV), turkey coronaviruses (TCoV), and Escherichia coli (Barnes and Guy 2003; Mor et al. 2013 ). Nevertheless, other viruses such as adenovirus, rotavirus, and reovirus and bacteria including Salmonella spp. are enterotropic agents associated with enteric problems. These enteric disorders are responsible for increasing mortality, growth depression, and immune dysfunctions (1). For this reason, TAstV and TCoV coinfections are suspected to predispose poults to infections by other \"opportunistic\" pathogens, such as E. coli and other agents (Barnes and Guy 2003; Qureshi et al. 2000) .",

In swine, a species where the disease has been studied in detail, the chronic form of the disease shows diarrhea with soft, brow feces, rough coat hair, decreased feed consumption, and reduced weight gain. The acute form of the disease usually affects finishing pigs and gilts (4-12 months of age) and is manifested as severe intestinal hemorrhage. Sudden death is common and postmortem examination reveals a pale (anemic) carcass, with hemorrhagic intestinal contents (Jacobson et al. 2010) .",

It was characterized by severe diarrhea, weight loss, ruffled feathers, prostration, drooping wings, and nervousness. The signs persisted up to at least 13 weeks of age. At postmortem examination, atrophy of the bursa of Fabricius, loss of intestinal mucosa, enteritis, and gas in the gut were evident. Samples from 22 turkey flocks affected in this way and aged between 10 and 104 days were received at the Laboratory of Avian Pathology in the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Each sample consisted of the whole enteric tract of five birds per flock, randomly selected ( Table 2 ). The samples were prepared as 20 % suspensions of enteric contents from the entire length in 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4 and clarified at 12,000\u00d7g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C.",

            "text": "TCoV infection has been reported in the USA (Pantin-Jackwood et al. 2008), UK (Cavanagh et al. 2002) , Canada (Dea et al. 1986 ), Australia (Nagaraja and Pomeroy 1997) , and Brazil (Villarreal et al. 2006; Bunger et al. 2009; Silva et al. 2009 ) as the causative agent of enteric diseases similar to those reported in this study. TAstV in commercial poultry has a worldwide distribution and causes the most prevalent viral infection in turkeys aged 1 to 5 weeks. This virus often occurs in association with other viruses, mainly rotavirus D, playing a role in enteric problems (Reynolds et al. 1987) . Nevertheless, in the present study, birds of several older ages (up to 104 days, i.e., almost 15 weeks) were found positive to TAstV-2, suggesting that the age range of susceptible animals is wider than previously reported. However, in our study, only one flock has this coinfection aged 49 days. Experimental infection of turkeys using TAstV associated with TCoV led to a more severe clinical response and a high mortality rate when compared to single-inoculations . In our survey, increase in the severity of clinical manifestation was not described. In cases of PEMS and enteric problems, mortality is usually high, and it is possible that outbreaks of this disease are caused by coinfections with two or more viruses, such as TAstV and TCoV (Xu et al. 1990 ; Barnes and Guy 2003; Jindal et al. 2012) . In our study, we detected a concomitance of four of the seven agents studied and the synergism between coronaviruses and other enterotropic viruses, such as Astroviruses, Salmonella, and L. intracellularis could have been responsible for the severity of the enteric disease observed and for the high mortality rates in the flocks surveyed. Jindal et al. (2009) reported the inoculation of a suspension positive for rotavirus, astrovirus, and Salmonella, resulted in significant lower body weights that controls. TAstV and TCoV can be detected in intestinal contents of poults prior to the onset of clinical disease and gross pathologic changes; in the same way, poults in the later stages of astrovirus infection may display clinical signs even without detectable astrovirus particles in their intestinal tract (Reynolds and Schultz-Cherry 2003) . This may explain why some apparently normal flocks or without information, such as those in the present study, were positive to both TCoV and Li and while flocks exhibiting typical signs of TCoV infection were negative to these viruses. Avian reoviruses are frequently identified in enteric diseases, including runting syndrome, growth impairment, and PEMS (Heggen-Peay et al. 2002) . In our survey, reovirus was not detected, although some clinical manifestation could be associated with this virus (for ex. flocks 1, 2, and 8). The same result was obtained with HEV. According to turkey industry, in Brazil, since 2002, flocks are not vaccinated due to absence of clinical manifestation or diagnosis of hemorrhagic enteritis. The presence of rotavirus detected by PCR is worth noting, because the commonly used PAGE detection has been shown to be 100,000 times less sensitive than the revere transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (Gouvea et al. 1994; Bezerra et al. 2012) . Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2007) also found out a higher prevalence of astrovirus and rotavirus in healthy flocks when compared the same results in those previously studied using PAGE and electron microscopy techniques. Besides, PCR is able to detect non-group A rotaviruses, in the case of mixed infections Bezerra et al. 2012) . Remarkably, all six positive results were found to be in association with another agent and five of them showed signs that indicate relevant damage into the intestinal mucosa, probably due to destruction of enterocytes by rotavirus in association with Salmonella spp. Plus damage of crypts cells by TAstV and of cells from the apical portion of villi by TCoV exacerbated the clinical status of birds.",

Furthermore, experimental studies using SPF birds are needed to appraise the synergism among these enteropathogens and others such as protozoa and bacteria, such as E. coli and Brachyspira spp. A comprehensive molecular characterization of the identified viruses and bacteria will help understand genetic diversity and assist in establishing preventive and control measures for turkey enteric disease.",
