Substitution of this motif resulted in MERS-CoV M leakage toward the plasma membrane. We further confirmed the role of 199 KxGxYR 204 as a TGN retention signal by using chimeras between MERS-CoV M and the M protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Our results indicated that the C-terminal domains of both proteins determine their specific localization, namely TGN and ERGIC/cis-Golgi for MERS-M and IBV-M, respectively. Our findings indicate that MERS-CoV M protein localizes to the TGN because of the combined presence of an ER export signal and a TGN retention motif.",

            "text": "functions as a signal peptide. The M protein is invariably glycosylated on its N-terminal domain. However, there are differences in the type of glycosylation. The murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and some other Betacoronavirus M proteins are O-glycosylated, whereas Alpha-and Deltacoronavirus M proteins are modified with N-linked sugars. The glycosylation is dispensable for virus assembly (11). The M protein is considered to be the motor of the assembly of viral particles because it is able to interact with all of the other structural proteins (12) (13) (14) . Important M-M interactions have also been demonstrated during assembly (15, 16) . For many coronaviruses, including the transmissible gastroenteritis virus, MHV, and IBV, the coexpression of M and E proteins in cells is sufficient to induce the production of virus-like particles (17) (18) (19) , indicating that these proteins are essential and sufficient to the assembly step. Only for SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein has been shown to be additionally required for the production of virus-like particles (20) . EM observations have shown that coronaviruses bud inside the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (21, 22) and then travel through the Golgi. Although the assembly step of coronaviruses occurs in the ERGIC compartment, it has been shown for several coronaviruses that the M protein expressed alone in cells can go beyond the assembly site in the secretory pathway (21) . However, the subcellular localization of the M protein varies between the different coronavirus species. Indeed, MHV M protein can reach the trans-Golgi network (TGN), whereas IBV-M protein is retained in the ERGIC and one or two cisternae of the cis-Golgi (21, 23, 24) . The intracellular retention of IBV-M has been attributed to the first membrane-spanning segment and particularly to polar residues located within this domain (25, 26) . For MHV, both the TM1 and the last 22 amino acids seem to be important determinants for the intracellular localization of the protein (27) . The aim of this study was to investigate the subcellular localization of the MERS-M protein and to characterize the signals involved in its trafficking.",

To analyze the intracellular trafficking of the MERS-CoV M protein, we transfected a vector expressing the MERS-CoV M protein with a HA tag fused at its N terminus (HA-MERS-M) in HeLa cells and compared the protein localization with different compartment markers using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig. 1B) . As observed in Fig. 1B , MERS-CoV M shows a good colocalization with TGN46 that localizes in the trans-Golgi network. We confirmed this colocalization by co-transfection of the M protein with the GFP fused to the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (GFP-CI-MPR). This reporter has been shown to be localized in the TGN in HeLa cells (28). The images were then analyzed using ImageJ to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for each co-staining (Fig. 1C) . The PCC measures the pixel-by-pixel covariance of the signal levels of two images (29) . The PCC values range from \u03ea1 to 1. A PCC value of 1 is obtained for two images whose intensities of fluorescence are linearly and perfectly related, whereas a value of \u03ea1 means that the intensities are inversely related to one another. Values near 0 mean that the intensities are uncorrelated. Our results confirm the localization of MERS-CoV M in the TGN with a PCC of 0.878 (\u03ee0.014) and 0.852 (\u03ee0.012) for the MERS-CoV M with TGN46 and GFP-CI-MPR markers, respectively. The PCCs for MERS-CoV M and CD4 (a cell surface marker) or the calreticulin (an ER marker) are below 0.4. However, the PCC between MERS-CoV M and the ERGIC marker, ERGIC-53, is higher (0.524 \u03ee 0.03).",

This offers the advantage of using a panel of antibodies raised in different species. To use these tools, we analyzed their intracellular localization to confirm that adding a tag, regardless of their sequence or the position of the insertion, had no effect on MERS-CoV M localization. We also generated a polyclonal antibody raised against a C-terminal peptide of the M protein to detect the untagged protein. This antibody was used to control the effect of the tags on the subcellular localization of the M protein. Cells expressing M or the different tagged versions of this protein were processed for double-label immunofluorescent detection of the M protein and TGN46 (Fig. 1D ). For each protein, the colocalization level with the TGN46 marker was also quantified by calculating the PCC (Fig. 1E ). As observed with HA-M, the untagged form of the protein presented a strong colocalization with the TGN46 marker ( Fig. 1, D and E) with a PCC of 0.857 \u03ee 0.015. Similar results were obtained with the other tagged proteins. Altogether, these results indicate that the MERS-CoV M protein expressed alone is located in the TGN and that the tag added to our constructs does not alter this localization.",

            "text": "The presence of the DxE signal explained the exit of the M protein from the ER but not its retention in the trans-Golgi, because it is commonly accepted that in nonpolarized cells, the constitutive secretory pathway leads to the plasma membrane by default (i.e. in absence of specific addressing/retention signals). Considering that and the fact that the M\u232c20-VSVG protein migrates to the cell surface, we looked for the presence of another signal in the last 20 amino acids of the cytosolic tail, which could be involved in the retention of MERS-CoV M in the TGN compartment. For this purpose, we constructed three smaller C-terminal deletion mutants lacking 5, 10, or 15 residues but keeping the VSVG tag to rescue the ER export. These mutants were called M\u232c5, M\u232c10, and M\u232c15. We then compared the subcellular localization of these mutants with the WT and M\u232c20 M proteins (Fig. 3 , A-C). Similar to what was observed for the WT M and in contrast to M\u232c20 protein, the M\u232c5, M\u232c10, and M\u232c15 proteins co-localized with the TGN46 marker, indicating that the 5-amino acid sequence AGNYR, located between the \u232c20 and \u232c15 deletions, is likely involved in the specific localization of the protein in the TGN. To identify the residues involved in the TGN localization of the protein, each amino acid (except the alanine) was mutated individually into alanine in the M\u232c15 protein. M\u232c15-G201A, M\u232c15-N202A, M\u232c15-Y203A, and M\u232c15-R204A were expressed in HeLa cells, and the subcellular localization of the proteins was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4) . The proteins carrying the mutation G201A, Y203A, or R204A showed a reduced colocalization with the TGN46 marker compared with the M\u232c15 (Fig. 4 , A and C), with partial export of the protein to the cell surface (Fig. 4 , B and C). This difference in intracellular trafficking is illustrated by a decrease of PCC between the M mutants and TGN46 associated with an increase of the PCC with CD4. These results indicate a role of these three residues in the localization of the protein in the TGN. The mutation N202A had no effect on the subcellular localization of the protein compared with the WT. To confirm these results, the mutation G201A, Y203A, or R204A was also inserted into the full-length protein. Analysis of the subcellular localization of these mutants is shown in Fig. 5 . M-G201A, M-Y203A, and M-R204A showed a reduced co-localization with TGN46 compared with the WT M-VSVG and an increase of cell surface expression, resulting in an increase of the PCC between the mutant and CD4. To ensure that we identified the full motif involved in the TGN localization of the protein, we also mutated three conserved residues (Tyr-195, Arg-197, or Lys-199) among the betacoronaviruses located upstream of the \u232c20 deletion. Interestingly, mutation of the residue Lys-199 also resulted in an increase of the cell surface expression of the protein (Fig. 5) .",

First, we verified that introducing the mutation N3Q had no effect on the intracellular localization of the different proteins (M, M\u232c20, M-DxE, M-K199A, M-G201A, M-Y203A, M-R204A, and M-KGYR; data not shown). Plasma membrane proteins in cells expressing the different mutants were labeled with nonpermeable biotin, and then biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6, A and B) . The M protein is only weakly expressed at the cell surface, with less than 1% of the total amount of protein expression at the cell surface. Mutation of the residues Lys-199, Gly-201, Tyr-203, and Arg-204 alone or in combination induced an increase in cell surface detection of the M protein, with \u03f313% of the total amount of N3Q-M-KGYR located at the cell surface. Single mutations induced only moderate increases of the cell surface expression compared with the quadruple mutant. The N3Q-M-DxE was barely detected at the cell surface. As seen in an immunofluorescent colocalization assay (Fig. 6B ), the expression of the N3Q-M\u232c20 mutant at the cell surface was slightly increased compared with the WT protein.

To test whether the KxGxYR motif is an endocytosis signal, we analyzed the endocytosis of the M protein in a biotinylation assay.

We detected the formation of dimers with a strong band migrating at 40 kDa and also the formation of higher oligomers for both proteins, suggesting that the increased cell surface expression conferred by the mutation of the motif KxGxYR is not due to a defect in M-M interactions.

As shown previously for MHV-M protein, we and others (33) found that ectopically expressed MERS-CoV M protein is mainly located in the TGN at steady state. In the cells, the TGN is a sorting station where proteins are either sent to the cell surface or diverted toward other endomembrane compartments. The localization of proteins in specific biosynthetic compartments generally results from an equilibrium between anterograde and retrograde movements of the proteins. For example, in immunofluorescent labeling of the protein TGN38/46, the protein is located in the TGN, but this localiza-tion is the consequence of a very dynamic process in which the protein is transported to the plasma membrane and recycled back to the TGN after internalization and sorting in endosomes. The SDYQRL motif in the C-terminal domain of the protein is important for its retrieval from the cell surface (34) . In addition, the transmembrane domain of the protein also participates in the TGN localization of the protein by mediating some retention in the TGN (35) . An increase of the transport of the protein to the cell surface can lead to the saturation of the retrieval mechanism of the protein and its accumulation at the cell surface.",

(39) reported that oligomerization of MHV-M protein is involved in the TGN retention of the protein; however, our results show that it is unlikely that the KxGxYR motif is involved in the oligomerization of the protein. As a small proportion of the MERS-CoV M protein could be detected at the cell surface (less than 1% of the total protein; see Fig. 6, A  and B) , we tested whether the KxGxYR motif could be an endocytosis motif. The MERS-CoV M protein is retrieved from the cell surface by endocytosis; however, we could not detect any defect of endocytosis of the M protein when the KxGxYR motif was mutated (Fig. 6, E and F) . This result argues against an endocytic function of this motif and suggests a role as a retention signal. Indeed, it was reported previously (27) that the MHV-M protein does not cycle between the plasma membrane of the cell and the TGN but rather acts as a TGN-resident protein. Another hypothesis is a cycle of the M between the ER and the TGN with the KxGxYR motif acting as a retrieval signal from the TGN to the ER. The mutation of this signal would inhibit the retrieval of the protein, allowing its trafficking to the cell surface. The retrograde trafficking ensures the constant recycling of proteins and lipids from the Golgi to the ER to maintain their steady-state distribution and the composition and function of the organelles themselves. Two distinct mechanisms are responsible for this retrograde transport. The first one depends on the coat protein complex I (COPI), and the second one is the COPI-independent pathway that is less characterized, involves the Rab6 GTPase, and is composed of tubular rather than vesicular carriers (40) . The formation of the COPI-coated vesicles starts with the recruitment en bloc of the coatomer composed of seven subunits by the Arf1 GTPase. Cargos carry specific signals in their cytosolic-exposed domain mediating their recruitment by COPI. The best characterized motifs are the di-lysine motifs KKxx or KxKxx that are recognized by the \u2423-COP or \u2424\u0408-COP subunit of the coatomer. Multimeric proteins, such as receptors or channels, contain an arginine-based sorting signal (RxR, where represents any hydrophobic amino acid). A common feature of the motif involved in the protein sorting toward the COPI-dependent pathway is the presence of basic residues. Because of its content in basic residues, the KxGxYR motif might be recognized by the COPI machinery to prevent its cell surface expression.",

As mentioned above, the transmembrane domain and an endocytic motif cooperate for the proper localization of TGN38/46.

The successful completion of glycosylation relies in part on the proper distribution of glycosyltransferases along the Golgi that will permit their action in a sequential manner. Most of the glycosyltransferases are type II transmembrane proteins. They consist of a short N-terminal domain exposed in the cytosol, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and an enzymatic domain. The nonuniform distribution of these enzymes in the Golgi is likely maintained by a combination of retention and recycling mechanisms (42) . The mechanisms that ensure the localization of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi are numerous and diverse. These include the oligomerization status of the enzyme and complex formation, the length of the transmembrane domain but also its composition, which may affect the way it is interacting with the different lipid compositions that the protein encounters in the different Golgi cisternae.

Unfortunately, the different chimeras that we constructed were not folded properly.

Therefore, to further confirm the role of the KxGxYR motif, we constructed chimeras between MERS-CoV M and IBV-M, as they show clear differences in subcellular localization at steady state. Indeed, IBV-M is mainly expressed in the ERGIC and cis-Golgi compartment. Previous studies reported the role of the first transmembrane segment in the intracellular retention of the protein (26) . This was shown by the replacement of the transmembrane domain of the glycoprotein G of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG) with the first transmembrane segment of IBV-M, which resulted in the intracellular retention of the protein, and four polar residues were shown to mediate this retention (25) . Surprisingly, when we replaced the first membrane-spanning domain of MERS-CoV M with that of IBV-M in the context where the KxGxYR motif is mutated into alanine residues (TM1-IBV/MERS-M-KGYR), the protein was not located in the ERGIC but was still transported to the cell surface. This difference may lie in the use of a full-length coronavirus M protein instead of a reporter protein such as VSVG.

M protein point mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR. Overlapping primers containing the mutation(s) of interest were designed and used for PCR on a MERS-M WT template. PCRs were then gel-purified, digested, and cloned into a pCDNA3.1-VSVG or pCDNA3.1-HA plasmid. The chimeric constructions were generated by fusion PCR. For IBV-M/MERS-M-Ct, the sequence of IBV-M corresponding to residues 1-101 were amplified with the forward primer 5\u0408-ttaagctttccatgcccaacgagacaaattg-3\u0408 and the reverse primer 5\u0408-taaacagccgaatactctggatccaataac-3\u0408, containing 10 bases complementary to the MERS-M sequence at its 5\u0408 extremity. The MERS-M sequence between residues 100 and 219 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5\u0408-ccagagtATTcggctgtttatgagaactgg-3\u0408 containing 10 bases complementary to the IBV-M sequence and with the primer D. Then the two PCR products were mixed and amplified using the forward primer that anneals the IBV-M sequence and the primer D. Using the The PCR products were gel-purified and digested by BamHI and EcoRI and then inserted into the pCDNA3.1-V5 expression vector. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.",

Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. In some cases, intracellular compartments were stained by transfecting an expression vector for a marker fused with GFP. For ERGIC and TGN compartments, cells were co-transfected with M proteins and expression vectors for ERGIC53 and M6PR fused to GFP, respectively.

In addition, it has been shown that the first transmembrane segment of IBV-M is involved in the intracellular retention of the protein.The amino acid sequences of the MERS-and IBV-M C-terminal extremity are not conserved and are rather different (Fig. 7A). First, we constructed chimeras in which we switched the C-terminal domains of the proteins: MERS-M/IBV-M and IBV-M/MERS-M or IBV-M/MERS-M-KGYR. We also replaced the first transmembrane segment of the MERS-M-KGYR with that of IBV-M to test whether the first transmembrane segment of IBV-M can retain MERS-M-KGYR intracellularly (TM1-IBV/ MERS-M-KGYR). Finally, we replaced the first transmembrane segment of IBV-M with that of MERS-CoV M. Schematic drawings of the different chimeras that were constructed are presented in Fig. 7B. The subcellular localization of the chimeric proteins was then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 8, the immunofluorescent staining of IBV-M and MERS-CoV M differed in their pattern, with a compact perinuclear staining for MERS-CoV M and a punctuated staining for IBV-M. Co-localization assessment of IBV-M with TGN46 and ERGIC-53 showed that the protein mainly localizes within the ERGIC. The MERS-M/IBV-M protein colocalized with the ERGIC-53 marker and not the TGN46 marker, and is thus located in the ERGIC (Fig. 8C), whereas the IBV-M/MERS-M protein colocalized with the TGN46 marker and not with the ERGIC-53 marker and is thus localized in the TGN. In other words, the switch of the C-terminal domains of the IBV-M and MERS-CoV M proteins caused a switch of their specific localizations, to the ERGIC and the TGN, respectively. Interestingly, the IBV-M/MERS-KGYR protein localized to the cell surface, confirming the role of the KxGxYR signal in the specific localization of the MERS-M protein to the TGN. This result also suggests that the first transmembrane segment of IBV-M is not able to retain MERS-M-KGYR intracellularly. In accordance with this result, the chimera TM1-IBV/MERS-M-KGYR was also located at the cell surface, and the chimera TM1-MERS/ IBV-M was located in the ERGIC compartment. These results are unexpected based on previous reports on the role of the first",
