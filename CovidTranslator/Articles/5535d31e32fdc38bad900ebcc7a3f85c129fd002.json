The VP4/VP2 sequence regions correlate with the serotype classification of HRV 1, 16, 31 . HRVC strains were defined using a nucleotide identity of <90%, based on the calculated genetic relatedness of established serotypes as previously described 26 . Applying this criterion, 19 distinct HRVC genotypes were identified, comprising 63 distinct strains that did not cluster into either the HRVA or HRVB groups( Figure 2 ). The HRVC genotypes had a mean nucleotide identity of 72.7%(minimum 66.4% and maximum 91.4%), compared to HRVA (mean 77.9%, minimum 70.5% and maximum 91.3%) and HRVB (mean 80%, minimum 78.6% and maximum 82.9%). Thus, HRVC viruses exhibited greater diversity among themselves than did HRVA. Based on comparisons of nucleotide identity, 3 of the HRVC genotypes were >95% identical with strains HRVQPM, HRVNY, and HRVX, and likely represent the same viruses [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . To our knowledge, the other 16 HRVC genotypes we identified have not been reported. Of the 131 HRVA strains sequenced, 10 were <90% identical to previously identified HRVA, including 5 that were <85% identical; these may represent novel HRVA types. Two of these potentially novel HRVA types were detected in 9 and 7 distinct subjects, respectively, demonstrating that these were common viruses in the study population. All but one of the few HRVB viruses were \u226590% identical with previously described strains; the remaining strain was 88.8% identical.",

Kaplan identified HRV in 11%(36/325) of hospitalized young children in Jordan 35, 36 . We enrolled a larger cohort than these studies and discovered a greater burden of HRV-associated illness in young children, likely because we used highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR. In addition, we found a trend in children with HRV/RSV coinfection to have more severe disease compared with HRV alone, evidenced by increased use of supplemental oxygen and duration of hospitalization. Papadopoulos et al. reported that the presence of HRV increases the risk for disease severity in acute bronchiolitis by approximately 5-fold 37 .",

These findings are the first report of HRVC disease in the Middle East. We observed several clinically significant differences between patients infected with HRVC compared to HRVA. Children with HRVC were more likely to require supplemental oxygen and less likely to report otalgia, suggesting that HRVC may be more virulent than HRVA. Excluding coinfections, children with HRVC were more likely to wheeze than children with HRVA. A recent multi-year population-based study of HRVC in two U.S. locations found that HRVC was associated with medically diagnosed wheezing and asthma 26 . These data, as well as other reports, suggest that viruses in the HRVC group are more likely to be associated with wheezing [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

This discrepancy may be attributable to the apparent seasonality of HRVC: HRV circulate year-round with peaks in the spring and fall 38 . In our previous study, HRVC was significantly more prominent in the fall months compared with HRVA, which predominated in the spring. Lau et al also identified an HRVC peak in the fall/winter, although they only detected 5 HRVC strains 23 . Thus, in this study during three winter months, we may have underestimated the true burden of illness of HRVC. Almost 70% of HRV detected in March were HRVA, consistent with our prior study. These seasonal variations underscore the importance of conducting studies over multiple seasons in diverse locations to understand fully the epidemiology of HRV.",

Second, we defined wheezing by parental report. Because other clinical symptoms may be confused with \"wheezing\", this could lessen the strength of association of HRVC with wheezing. However, other studies support this association [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] 18 . Third, we only evaluated samples during the peak winter months; therefore, we may have underestimated the overall burden of HRVC. We did not collect data on bacterial co-infections or antibiotic usage. However, rates of antibiotic use are high in this population, one study showed that over 60% of RSV-infected children were treated with antibiotics 40 .
