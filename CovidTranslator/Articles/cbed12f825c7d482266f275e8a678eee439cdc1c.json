Administration of Mouse Interferon. The highly purified mouse interferon (containing both or-and t3-interferon) used in this experiment was provided by Toray Basic Research Laboratory (Kamakura, Japan) (7) . It was prepared from mouse L-cells and had a specific activity of 3 \u2022 10 7 IU/mg protein. It was dissolved in physiological saline and was adjusted to have a concentration of 10 3 IU/0.2 ml. The mice given interferon were divided into four groups based on the time of inoculation: group IF1, one day before MHV-2 inoculation; group IF2, at the same time as inoculation; group IF3, one day after inoculation; and group IF4, two days after inoculation. To each group, 10 3 iU/mouse/day of the exogenous mouse interferon was administered intraperitoneally until the 4th day after MHV-2 inoculation. No treatment was given to the control (group C) after inoculation.

When a mouse anti-interferon antibody was administered to these mice starting from shortly after MHV-3 inoculation, they developed fulminant hepatitis and died. These observations suggested that the interferon system has an important role as an in vivo defense mechanism against MHV-hepatitis (9). On the other hand, according to the report of Schindler et al (10) in 1982, serum interferon levels increased significantly after inoculation with MHV-3 in C57 BL/6 mice (susceptible) which died of fulminant hepatitis after infection with MHV-3, whereas A/J mice (resistant) did not develop fulminant hepatitis, and the increase in serum interferon was insignificant. They concluded that the interferon system did not seem to be important as defense mechanism in vivo (10) . Thus, there is no established opinion as to how the interferon system is involved as MHV hepatitis progresses, nor have there been any reports assessing the effect of exogenous mouse interferon on MHV hepatitis.",
