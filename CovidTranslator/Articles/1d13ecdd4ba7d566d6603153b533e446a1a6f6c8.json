Guidelines published by the HICPAC/SHEA/APIC/ IDSA Hand Hygiene Task Force provide specific recommendations. 3 Alcohol-based hand rubs can be used where there is limited access to water. They have better acceptability, less skin irritation, and quicker application compared with soap and water, resulting in improved compliance. Commercially prepared products are available, but a low-cost gel can be prepared by hospital pharmacies using 20 mL of glycerin, propylene glycol, or sorbitol mixed with 980 mL of >70% isopropanol. Gels combining chlorhexidine and alcohol may be more effective than alcohol alone because of chlorhexidine's prolonged bactericidal effect, but are expensive. They should be limited to situations when a high degree of hand antisepsis is necessary, such as before surgical procedures and placing invasive devices.",

Although passive surveillance (based on clinical samples) is less costly and labor intensive, it can miss a reservoir of asymptomatic, colonized patients. Active surveillance involves screening asymptomatic patients for resistant organisms and can lead to rapid isolation of colonized patients. However, the patient populations that should be targeted for screening and the optimal screening method remain unresolved. Cost is another major limiting factor. Hospitals should assess what is feasible in their setting. To overcome surveillance shortcomings, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a low-cost, computer-based antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance program (WHONET) that can monitor resistance trends and generate locally applicable guidelines on antimicrobial use. 4 An additional impediment to surveying resistant organisms is the lack of reliable culture and susceptibility data, as standardization and quality assurance of microbiology laboratories is not enforced in most developing countries.",

High rates of gram-negative HAIs have been documented in neonatal nurseries in low-income countries with rates threefold to twentyfold higher than in developed regions. 7, 8 HAIs are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality, are a waste of precious resources, and subvert patient expectations of quality medical care. This increases negativity toward the health care system, especially because patients bear the costs of HAIs in many developing countries. Reducing the risk of HAIs in developing countries is a priority of the WHO. 9 Hospitals with inadequate vector control can amplify vectorborne illnesses such as malaria, dengue, leishmaniasis, and filariasis because of infected patients in an overcrowded environment. 14",

Standard precautions combined with strict contact precautions and single-room isolation, especially for acutely bleeding patients or in those with profuse diarrhea or vomiting, are recommended until discharge to prevent nosocomial transmission. 15 Patients can be cohorted in a designated area; failing that, they can be housed in a portion of a larger ward, in an uncrowded corner of a large hall, in rooms designated for airborne isolation, or in private rooms. In the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, treatment centers were created for assessing, observing, and treating patients suspected of having Ebola. Health care workers should be specifically trained in caring for these patients and other personnel restricted. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should include a scrub suit, gloves, and waterproof boots (if the floor is soiled), over which a disposable gown, plastic apron, thick gloves, fluid-resistant particulate respirator (FFP2-or EN-certified equivalent or U.S. NIOSH-certified N95), and protective goggles or face shield should be worn.
