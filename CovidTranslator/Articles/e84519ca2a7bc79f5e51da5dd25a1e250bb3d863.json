Tropical pulmonary disease includes most temperate climate etiologies as well as a greater incidence and prevalence of tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related disease, and helminthic infections. Diverse factors such as poverty, crowding, malnutrition, and proximity to animals are responsible for a range of diseases that are infrequently encountered outside the tropics.",

Most notably, in China and Southeast Asia in 2003, the ability of a zoonotic coronavirus (later designated SARS CoV) to infect humans led to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS quickly became a major public health emergency not only in much of Asia but also in Canada and, to a lesser extent, in the United States and Europe. Novel influenza viruses have commonly been first discovered in tropical Asian populations where animals, especially chickens, ducks, and pigs, are often kept in close proximity to humans. As outbreaks of avian (and swine) influenza occur in these areas, sporadic cases of these same strains occur in humans, creating the potential for human-zoonotic recombinations and the possibility of returning travelers presenting with these \"exotic\" strains.",

            "text": "Upper respiratory illnesses (URIs) are the most common infections in humans in both temperate and tropical climates and are primarily viral in etiology. The frequency of respiratory infections among children is much greater than in adults. 7 Although the frequency of URIs in the tropics appears to be no higher than in temperate climates, children in the tropics often suffer from chronic malnutrition. Undernourished children experience respiratory infections, coupled with bouts of diarrhea, intestinal helminth infection, epidemic measles, and more. These co-morbidities make what might be a mild respiratory illness in an otherwise healthy child significantly more serious in children living in the tropics (Table 128 -2). 8 The role of viral URIs, particularly influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, in predisposing individuals to subsequent bacterial infection, predominantly with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae has emphasized the importance of controlling epidemic influenza in developing nations where vaccines have been historically underutilized. 9 Acute lower respiratory infections cause most of the respiratory disease-associated deaths and, in terms of years of life 10 The most common etiologies of childhood pneumonia in developing countries are summarized in Box 128-2. 11 Although all age groups have some deaths associated with lower respiratory infections, the greatest burden is borne by children, especially those younger than 5 years old, with an estimated 3 to 4 million deaths annually. 12, 13 Data from WHO reveal a marked difference in the proportion of deaths in children less than 5 years old caused by ARIs in Europe (11%) and the Americas (14%) versus Africa (22%) and Southeast Asia (19%). 1 Most developed nations of Europe and North America report less than 5% of childhood deaths due to ARIs. Africa not only bears the burden of very high childhood mortality, but also has nations with more than 25% of childhood deaths due to ARIs. 1 The role of co-infection with HIV and/or malnutrition in ARI-associated deaths cannot be overemphasized. Recent WHO data from Botswana, currently the nation with the highest prevalence of HIV infection, revealed that aproximately 60% of childhood deaths due to HIV/acquired immunodeficiency virus (AIDS), often associated with respiratory coinfections. 14 S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae remain the most important bacterial causes of pneumonia in young children, accounting for 70% of the deaths from pneumonia and neonatal sepsis. 11 The use of H. influenzae B and, more recently, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines has dramatically decreased the frequency of these infections in developed countries but, due to their cost, they remain underutilized in the developing nations. 9 Bacterial antimicrobial resistance has become an increasing problem worldwide, including in the tropics. Lack of antibiotic availability in some areas has led to low prevalence of resistant organisms. Conversely, poorly controlled access to antibiotics and inappropriate use has led to very high levels of resistance in other areas. One study in Uganda identified 95% of S. pneumoniae as penicillin-resistant and 75% of H. influenzae as \u03b2-lactamase producing. Despite this resistance, there was a good clinical response to ampicillin even among HIV-infected individuals. 15 Availability of antibiotics in developing nations is quite variable: Many nations have access to less expensive penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline and aminoglycosides, but the more expensive third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and newer macrolides that are commonly used in developed nations are often unavailable.",

Outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease associated with travel, especially among the elderly, have been reported on numerous occasions. Nearly half the cases of Legionella pneumonia in the United Kingdom are travel-associated. 16 Measles (rubeola) is the most important viral respiratory disease. Measles is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in much of the developing world, with an estimated 40 million annual cases and 800,000 deaths per year, half of which occur in Africa. Most unvaccinated children in endemic areas are infected by age 5. 17 Since the introduction of measles vaccination in 1963, there has been a marked decrease in measles cases and, as of March 2005, no indigenous transmission of measles has occurred in the Americas for over 2 years; WHO has a goal of worldwide eradication by 2015. 17 Numerous studies from the 1930s to the present have demonstrated a marked reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with measles infections after initiation of childhood vitamin A supplementation. This is especially evident in refugee settings where malnutrition and a measles outbreak may be the leading cause of death. 18 Particular settings in the tropics may suggest the role of certain bacterial organisms: Examples are staphylococcal pneumonia complicating measles and varicella, pertussis in areas with inadequate childhood immunization, and Klebsiella pneumonia in lower socioeconomic rural settings where alcoholism and malnutrition may play a role. Chronic cavitary upper lobe infiltrates in a patient from Southeast Asia may be misidentified as tuberculosis but actually represent melioidosis, a chronic infection of Burkholderia pseudomallei, a soil saprophyte endemic to Southeast Asia and part of Australia (see Chapter 34) . Melioidosis is the most common cause of fatal, community-acquired pneumonia at a regional referral hospital in the Northern Territory of Australia. In a series of 252 cases of melioidosis in Australia, half presented with pneumonia and one-quarter were bacteremic, 15% presented with pneumonia and septic shock, and 84% of the septic individuals died. 19 Melioidosis is well documented to occur months to years after exposure and it should remain in the differential diagnosis for those with appropriate exposure who present with chronic, subacute or acute pulmonary disease that may appear to be tuberculosis. 20 Occupational exposures may suggest an etiology for unusual bacterial pneumonias such as anthrax, Q fever, tularemia, and leptospirosis. Outbreaks associated with Hantaviruses, pneumonic plague, influenza, and SARS corona-virus are all potential etiologies that should be considered. Since all of these rarer causes of pneumonia can be found nearly worldwide to varying degrees, it may be most helpful to query WHO (www.who.int/csr/outbreaknet work/en/) or CDC (www.cdc.gov/travel/outbreaks.htm) websites to get updates about outbreaks of diseases in different countries.",

Ascaris are most likely to be associated with development of significant pulmonary symptoms; hookworm and Strongyloides usually cause minimal inflammation during pulmonary transmigration. Loeffler' s syndrome occurs 10 to 12 days after ingestion of Ascaris eggs (or 5-10 days after penetration of hookworm or Strongyloides larva) and, if there are any symptoms, is characterized by development of 5 to 10 days of nonproductive cough, burning substernal chest pain, and, frequently, wheezing and rales. Chest radiograph reveals ill-defined, patchy, homogenous consolidation or, occasionally, a fine miliary pattern. Infiltrates may be unilateral or bilateral, have indefinite borders, and range from a few millimeters to 2 to 3 cm. 23 The migration of the larvae of Toxocara canis or T. cati in pulmonary tissues as a manifestation of visceral larva migrans (see Chapter 103) is associated with high levels of eosinophilia, and may be associated with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and transient reticulonodular infiltrates. 30 Schistosomes may be associated with eosinophilia and chest symptoms (see Chapter 116). Especially in nonimmune travelers, acute schistosomiasis (3-8 weeks after schistosome penetration) may be associated with headache, malaise, dyspnea, wheezing, and nonproductive cough, especially while recumbent in bed. These pulmonary symptoms may coincide with the fever (Katayama fever) associated with acute infection, but more commonly present a few weeks after resolution of fever and are associated with marked eosinophilia (approximately 30%-50%), mild to moderate leukocytosis, and liver enzyme abnormalities. 31 Since schistosomes pass through the lung shortly after penetration (5-7 days), the pulmonary symptoms are likely an immune effect triggered in the lung while the organism has become established elsewhere in the host, similar to established intestinal helminths that may also cause pulmonary infiltrates. 32 Chronic pulmonary disease is a complication of established schistosomal infections as ectopic migration of schistosome eggs occurs. This becomes more common in late disease as portal hypertension leads to portacaval shunts and deposition of eggs in the pulmonary vasculature. The granulomatous response to eggs in the pulmonary vessels leads to pulmonary hypertension and eventually cor pulmonale. Finally, some helminths (most importantly Paragonimus spp. and Echinococcus spp.) establish their adult stage in the lung and may be associated with years of waxing and waning eosinophilia 30 (see Chapters 114 and 117).",

Concerns about travelers visiting areas of high TB endemicity and potential exposures during air travel are frequently raised. The risk of acquiring TB infection among short-term travelers and on flights is actually quite low. 42 Despite commonly held misconceptions about aircraft air systems, the fairly rapid filtering of air released overhead and leaving the cabin near the floor close to the same row removes and dilutes most infectious particles. Despite hundreds of thousands of flights annually, transmission of TB on aircraft has rarely been reported. 42 In contrast to short-term travelers, those who remain in areas with a high prevalence of TB have rates of infection that approach that of the local population. This was seen most dramatically in long-term Dutch travelers to Africa, Asia, and Latin America, where their risk of infection increased from approximately 10 infections per 100,000 person-years to approximately 2000 infections per 100,000 person-years. Health-care workers with direct patient contact had more than threefold greater risk of TB than other travelers. 43 Obviously, in considering the possibility of tuberculosis in a returning traveler, a new immigrant or a patient in the tropics, it is critical to know the prevalence of TB in the nation of concern as well as contacts with TB, the living situation, and the activity of the individual evaluated.

Again, consideration of the length of travel, the prevalence of TB in the area, and the activities planned by the individual may make either BCG immunization or TST reasonable recommendations for some individuals. 44, 45 Individuals who immigrate to developed nations have been documented in numerous studies to have a much higher incidence of TB disease than natives of developed nations. Over 50% of cases of TB in the United States and the United Kingdom occur in people born overseas, and the incidence of disease is more than 3 times greater in foreign-born than U.S.-born individuals. 46, 47 Approximately 25% of foreign TB cases diagnosed in the United States present within the first year of presentation. The incidence of active TB among political asylum seekers in London was 241 per 100,000, a level 20 times greater than the overall incidence in England. 48 Clearly individuals from developing nations who present with pulmonary complaints, especially chronic cough associated with hemoptysis, weight loss, and night sweats, should have TB considered as one of the more likely etiologies on a differential diagnosis and have chest radiography, possibly a TST, and sputa examination as part of the evaluation. In some cases, the index of suspicion may be so high that empiric therapy with four antituberculous drugs, preferably with directly observed therapy, should be instituted. Since the prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB is significantly higher in many developing nations, use of four drugs and mycobacterial sensitivity profiles should always be used. 49",

More recent studies have demonstrated the development of pulmonary edema during the treatment of falciparum malaria, especially more severe cases. Malaria-associated pulmonary edema is noncardiogenic (high cardiac index and low systemic vascular resistance) and is considered by most authorities to be consistent with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and related to the malaria-associated increase in pulmonary permeability. 50 While pulmonary edema occurs in less than 1% of all cases of falciparum malaria, it was found in 42% of a series of U.S. soldiers in the Second World War who died of severe malaria. 51 More recently, three of five Marines who returned from Liberia in 2003 with more than 10% falciparum parasitemia developed ventilatory failure and an ARDS-like presentation 48 to 72 hours after initiation of antimalarial treatment and clearance of parasitemia (unpublished personal data).

Poorly regulated working conditions in agriculture and mining have resulted in substantial burdens of occupationally related and environmental lung disease in many regions. 57 Although good prevalence data are lacking, it is likely that there are millions of cases of silicosis worldwide 58 and possibly comparable numbers of other lung disorders due to cotton dust (byssinosis), 59 extrinsic allergic alveolitis caused by microbial contamination of agricultural products such as sugar cane, and airway injury from indiscriminant use and poor control of indoor and outdoor air pollutants. 3, 60 There is a dramatic increase in both TB risk and virulence in populations with silicosis, and probably also people with exposure to silica without overt silicosis. In areas where large portions of the (male) population have been historically recruited into mining, as in southern Africa, this risk factor is very broadly disseminated and may account in part for the astronomical rates of TB in that region of the world. In a study of 304 men from Botswana who had been employed in South African mines for a mean of 15 years, 30% had pneumoconiosis and 6.8% had progressive massive fibrosis, and additionally 26% had a history of, or current, tuberculosis. 61 While adult males are the primary victims of occupational exposures, children and women face increased risk from indoor, nonoccupational exposures due to the use of dung and other biomass fuels for cooking and heating huts and homes. When combusted, these materials emit everything from silica and other minerals to hazardous air pollutants such as oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, resulting in various clinical problems, including silicosis (so-called hut lung in this setting), chronic bronchitis, asthma, and increased risk of respiratory tract infection. 4, 60 The most severely affected regions are those with colder climates, such as the sierra region of South America, the mountainous regions of central Asia, and the high plains of Africa. Ambient air pollution due to rapid urbanization has resulted in levels of ozone, oxides of nitrogen, and other irritants (photo-oxidant pollution) that are much higher than even in the worst cities in Europe and North America. Data from Latin America, India, and China suggest that very high rates of respiratory infection and asthma may be resulting. 3",
