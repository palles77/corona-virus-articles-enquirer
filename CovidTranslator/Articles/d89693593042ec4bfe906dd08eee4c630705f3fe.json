Concentrated and dialyzed (cutoff 12,000) B. sulfurescens culture filtrate also contains a highmolecular-weight compound cytotoxic for the Mamestra brassicae cell line. A fractionation in two chromatographic steps separated a cytotoxic fraction (IC50 = 1.15 -+ 0.05 ~Lg/ ml), which was poorly toxic to larvae (LCso = 150 -+ 10 I~g/ ml) and an insecticidal fraction (LC5o = 2.1 -+ 0.1 pLg/ml) devoid of detectable cytotoxicity. The two kinds of activity, i.e., cytotoxicity in vitro and toxicity in vivo are thus independent. The cytotoxic activity, initially detected on a M. brassicae cell line, also affected two other insect cell lines (G. mellonella and Spodoptera frugiperda). The cytotoxic fraction provoked not only the inhibition of cell proliferation, but also cell death. Adhesive mammalian cell lines were not sensitive. Nonadhesive mammalian cell lines of murine myeloma and hybridomas were poorly sensitive.",

Chromatographic fractionation indicated that the in vivo and in vitro activities were unrelated. INTRODUCTION Entomopathogenic fungi produce several insecticidal toxins and are thus of interest as potential biological control agents. These toxins can be classified in two groups: (i) low-molecular-weight compounds including cyclodepsipeptides (cyclic peptides of 6 or 7 amino acids) and (ii) higher-molecular-weight protein molecules . A number of cyclodepsipeptides have been purified and extensively studied (Lysenko and Kucera, 1971; Roberts, 1981; Vey et al., 1986; Kleinhauf and von DShren, 1986) . Some of them were found to exhibit cytotoxic effects on insect cell lines (Quiot et al., 1985) . The high-molecular-weight protein toxins were initially described as proteases in Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana (Kucera and Samsinakova, 1968; Kucera, 1980) but have not been purified or further characterized. Recently, we described a high-molecular-weight glycopro-",
