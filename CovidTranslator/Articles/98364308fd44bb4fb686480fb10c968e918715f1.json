Methods: A total of 32 6-month-old New Zealand white rabbits were selected (averagely weighing 2.75-3.25 kg) and added TRI into nerve block solution for LPB. The rabbit were randomly divided into four groups: group A1: 2.5 ml \u00c2 2 times, group A2 2.5 ml \u00c2 4 times, group B1 5 ml \u00c2 2 times, and group B2 5 ml \u00c2 4 times; the time interval among the injection was 5 days, and the structural changes of FHC were the observed using 50/100/200 light microscope; the modified Mankin pathological scoring was also performed for the evaluation. Results: There exhibited significant microscopic changes of FHC structures between the rabbits performed LPB and the normal rabbits, among which group B2 exhibited the most serious FHC damages, and the Mankin pathological score in group B2 was much higher than those in the other three groups, and the scores of the experimental group were higher than the control group. Conclusions: The addition of TRI in LPB can damage the FHC structures, and large-dose (5 ml/once) and long-course (four times) will result in more serious injuries.",

Another study focused on coccygodynia and draw the conclusion that ganglion impair block appears to be more effective than conservative therapy in resistant patients, 82% of the patients achieve at least 50% relief of pain after the first treatment, and the relief lasts for a median duration of 6 months (Gunduz et al., 2015) .",

For example, nerve block has recently emerged as a novel alternative treatment in chronic knee pain (Safi et al., 2015; Yasar et al., 2015) ; furthermore, mixing injections of corticosteroids in neuroleptics has increasingly been used in clinical practice. The mechanisms of nerve block treatment toward chronic pain include blocking the vicious cycle of pain, suppressing central sensitization, improving the blood circulation of pain, promoting the absorption of inflammatory mediators, and significantly reducing the inflammatory cytokines inside knee articular cavity fluid when applied in lumbosacral plexus and branch nerve block; furthermore, it can relieve muscle spasms and improve muscle nutrition (Yasar et al., 2015) . One study reported that a mixture of local anesthetic and corticosteroid (bupivacaine 0.25% with methyl-prednisolone 20-120 mg) for the treatment of refractory cancer-related pain in the brachial plexus territory was acceptable and effective (Huang et al., 2015; Baheti, 2015; Zinboonyahgoon et al., 2015) . Meanwhile, perineural dexamethasone addition to local anesthetic solutions in brachial plexus block also significantly improves the pain while without increasing complications (Knezevic et al., 2015) , and also prolongs the duration of analgesia (Abdallah et al., 2015; Sindhu et al., 2017) .",

It's still unknown whether it can cause damages to the articular cartilage inside the innervation area, the dose and frequency of application still needs to be considered (Wang et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2014) . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reveal that damages would have occurred in early phase after the start of steroid administration (Kubo et al., 2016) . Not only bone but also cartilage is severely affected by glucocorticoids (Hartmann et al., 2016; Shamsudin et al., 2017) . Damages of hormones on cartilage is caused when hormones contact with cartilage, they will damage the cartilage matrix, particularly the matrix metalloproteinases, thus increasing the apoptosis of chondrocytes. When performing nerve block, glucocorticoids added into nerve tissue fluid can reach the distal tissue via axonal motions. When the drugs reach the subchondral bone, they can reach the inner side of cartilage tissue via osmosis, and then result in cartilage injuries (Iwaniak et al., 2015) .",

It's speculated that the inflammatory and analgesic effects of the added glucocorticoids during nerve block toward distal tissue are transported around inflammatory tissues via nerve axonal motions, thus reducing inflammation and edema at lesions, and promoting the absorption of inflammatory mediators. Meanwhile, TRI can reach the articular cartilage by an unknown route, and then cause cartilage damages. It can also be seen from this study that the higher the dose, as well as the longer the duration, the severer the damages. Therefore, the optimal doses and duration still need further refinement so as to achieve the maximum benefits.",
