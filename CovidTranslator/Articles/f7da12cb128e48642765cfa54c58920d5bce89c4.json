Like other \u03b1-herpesvirinae subfamily members, BHV-1 establishes lifelong latency in ganglionic neurons of the peripheral nervous system after initial replica-tion in mucosal epithelium. Virus reactivation and spread to susceptible animals occur after natural or corticosteriod-induced stress (Rock et al, 1992; Sheffy and Davies, 1972) . Although the primary site of BHV-1 latency is sensory neurons within trigeminal ganglia (TG), long-term persistence and reactivation occur within germinal centers of pharyngeal tonsil (Winkler et al, 2000b) .",

BHV-1 infection leads to transient immunosuppression, thus promoting secondary bacterial infections and pneumonia (Carter et al, 1989; Griebel et al, 1987a Griebel et al, , 1987b Griebel et al, , 1990 .

(A) Partial restriction map, location of LR-RNA, organization of LR ORF, and 3 terminus of the bICP0 ORF. The start sites for LR transcription during latency and productive infection were previously described (Devireddy and Jones, 1998; Hossain et al, 1995) . Reading frames B and C (RF-B and RF-C) each contain an open reading frame that lacks an initiating Met. The asterisk ( * ) denotes the position of stop codons that are in frame with the respective ORF. (B) DNA sequence of the SphI-SphI fragment (781 to 812) and the mutant oligonucleotide. The first ATG in the wt sequence is the first in frame ATG for ORF2 and this Met is underlined. Stop codons in the mutant oligonucleotide are in all three reading frames (bold and underlined). The EcoRI restriction enzyme site (GAATTC) was incorporated into the mutant oligonucleotide to facilitate screening. (C) Schematic diagram of ORF-1. The numbers below ORF-1 indicate the nucleotide numbers in the LR gene. The alanine-rich domain in ORF-1 (A-rich) spans nucleotides 1321 to 1509. The position of the ORF-1 peptide antibody that was used in a previous study is denoted by an oval. The 5 and 3 splice sites that were detected during productive infection (Prod. Inf) or at 7 days after infection in TG (7 dpi) are denoted by the arrows. Both splice variants yield a transcript in which a portion of ORF-2 is fused to ORF-1. cells by repressing expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and the transporter associated with antigen presentation (Koppers-Lalic et al, 2005) . CD4+ T-cell function is impaired during acute infection because BHV-1 infects CD4+ T cells and induces apoptosis (Winkler et al, 1999) .",

Our studies indicate that ORF-1 is expressed in productively infected bovine cells and TG neurons of calves latently infected with wt BHV-1. Following infection of bovine kidney cells with the LR mutant virus, ORF-1 expression is reduced. Confocal microscopy revealed ORF-1 is localized to the nucleus and/or cytoplasm during productive infection, whereas antiserum that recognizes the ORF-2 fusion protein detects a nuclear protein (Jiang et al, 1998) . The RF-C fusion antiserum recognizes a viral specific protein that localizes to the cytoplasm in productively infected cells. Because the ATG of ORF-1 is approximately 200 bases downstream from stop codons at the 5 terminus of ORF-2 in the LR mutant virus, we suggest that these stop codons do not completely block ORF-1 expression.",

The LR mutant virus contains three stop codons adjacent to the first in frame ATG of ORF-2 (Inman et al, 2001) ( Figure 1B) . Consequently, the LR mutant virus does not express detectable levels of ORF-2, RF-C, or their respective fusion proteins that would normally be expressed as a result of alternative splicing (Jiang et al, 2004) . Antiserum directed against a peptide near the N-terminus of ORF-1 ( Figure 1C ) did not reproducibly recognize a viral-specific protein in infected or transfected cells (Hossain et al, 1995) . The major spliced LR-RNA detected during productive infection or in TG at 7 days after infection lacks sequences encompassing the N-terminus of ORF-1 because of splicing (Devireddy et al, 2003) ( Figure 1C ). These LR transcripts can be translated into a protein with ORF-2 fused to ORF-1 (ORF-2/ORF-1 fusion protein) (Devireddy et al, 2003; Devireddy and Jones, 1998) , suggesting that a portion of ORF-1 is expressed after splicing of LR-RNA. Because LR-RNA splicing is complicated and there may be more spliced transcripts, generating additional peptide antibodies or monoclonal antibodies directed against ORF-1 was not a logical approach. Consequently, we chose to The partially purified His-and Xpress-tagged ORF-1 protein was used for a Western blot. The rabbit ORF-1 polyclonal antiserum was used to probe lane 1, and the X-press antibody was used to probe lane 2. Molecular weight markers appear in kDa.",

We predict that if the intact ORF-1 Identification of a novel protein encoded by the latency-related gene of bovine F Meyer et al 575 is expressed, it plays an important role in this process because the LR mutant virus does not express detectable levels of ORF-1 during latency. Even if the intact ORF-1 protein is not expressed, ORF-1 protein coding domains can be fused with ORF-2 to yield a protein that regulates gene expression and inhibits apoptosis (Devireddy et al, 2003; Devireddy and Jones, 1998; Meyer et al, 2007) . Furthermore, genetic evidence clearly demonstrates that expression of ORF-2 or a fusion protein containing a portion of ORF-2 with ORF-1 is required for the latency reactivation cycle in cattle , in part because the LR mutant virus induces higher levels of apoptosis in TG neurons (Lovato et al, 2003) . Regardless of whether ORF-1 is expressed as an intact protein, certain ORF-1 protein coding domains are likely to be important because they can be fused with ORF-2 as a result of alternative splicing of LR-RNA.",

The recombinant baculovirus strain was grown in SF9 insect cells using procedures described by Invitrogen. Recombinant baculovirus that contained ORF-1 sequences were characterized by testing for ORF-1 protein expression using the Xpress antibody that recognizes the Xpress epitope at the 5 terminus of ORF-1 protein sequences (R910-25; Invitrogen). Large-scale expression was carried out in 2-L flasks seeded with SF9 cells at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml in a total volume of 1000 ml. At 4 days after infection, cells were pelleted by centrifuging for 30 min at 8000 rpm (Beckman J2-21 centrifuge, JA-10 rotor), and suspended in 20 ml of Guanidinium Lysis Buffer (6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.8).

The start sites for LR transcription during latency and productive infection were previously described (Devireddy and Jones, 1998; Hossain et al, 1995). Reading frames B and C (RF-B and RF-C) each contain an open reading frame that lacks an initiating Met. The asterisk ( * ) denotes the position of stop codons that are in frame with the respective ORF. (B) DNA sequence of the SphI-SphI fragment (781 to 812) and the mutant oligonucleotide. The first ATG in the wt sequence is the first in frame ATG for ORF2 and this Met is underlined. Stop codons in the mutant oligonucleotide are in all three reading frames (bold and underlined). The EcoRI restriction enzyme site (GAATTC) was incorporated into the mutant oligonucleotide to facilitate screening. (C) Schematic diagram of ORF-1. The numbers below ORF-1 indicate the nucleotide numbers in the LR gene. The alanine-rich domain in ORF-1 (A-rich) spans nucleotides 1321 to 1509. The position of the ORF-1 peptide antibody that was used in a previous study is denoted by an oval. The 5 and 3 splice sites that were detected during productive infection (Prod. Inf) or at 7 days after infection in TG (7 dpi) are denoted by the arrows. Both splice variants yield a transcript in which a portion of ORF-2 is fused to ORF-1.",
