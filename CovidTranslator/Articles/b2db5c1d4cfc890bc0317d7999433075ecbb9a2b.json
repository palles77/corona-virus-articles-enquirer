These other experts may include bacteriologists, virologists, veterinarians, or animal model experts, as well as plant researchers. The chair must have a vast understanding of scientific techniques and knowledge. The other members of the committee may also have a wide and varying range of scientific knowledge. Animal models are an essential resource for research related to disease and infection. Animal models can be used in many different ways, including mimicking human infection, replacing the model animal's genes with others -including genes of human origin -to create transgenic animals, or \"knocking out\" certain genes to determine how loss of function of a given gene affects a particular disease state or the animal's overall health and development.",

Mice are a prime example; mice are surprisingly similar to humans in terms of genetics, physiology, and anatomy -a fact that the average person may not appreciate. Perhaps the greatest factor contributing to the utility of mice as a model of human disease is the fact that 80% of the genes in the mouse genome have a direct counterpart in the human genome [1] . These similarities make it possible to identify and model genetic risk factors in mice that are relevant to human disease. Other animal models can also be useful for more specific research applications. Rats, for instance, are often used for neurological studies as their brains function in a manner similar to humans. The rat and human genomes are also highly similar, and up to 90% of rat genes have direct human counterparts; however, genomic manipulation has proven more difficult in the rat relative to the mouse, and mouse models therefore remain more popular [2] .",

People may be allergic to animal dander, saliva, or urine, or even to the animal bedding.

In many cases, these metabolites can be derived from administered toxins of biological origin.

As part of this review process, the IBC may be tasked with determining how the aforementioned issues are to be handled, in conjunction with other chemical or biosafety professionals.

RG2 agents cause diseases in humans that are rarely serious, and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available.

RG3 agents are associated with serious or lethal human diseases such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (one of the agents causing tuberculosis), severe acute respiratory syndrome, Yersinia pestis (plague), or Brucella abortus, for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available; this typically means high risk for individual researchers, but lower risk to the general community. Finally, RG4 agents cause serious or lethal human diseases for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are generally not available, creating high levels of risk for both individuals and the outside community [4] .

The ABSL correlates with the risk group of the agent in most cases, with the lowest level of protection required at ABSL-1 [5] . It is important to note the process for determining the biosafety level at which a particular agent is to be handled. Biological agents are not classified according to biosafety levels; rather, the biosafety level takes into account the containment requirements for a specific agent and experiment based on the risk group category designated at the risk assessment stage. For example, the potential creation of an aerosol for experimental purposes of a RG2 organism may increase the biosafety level from BSL-2 to BSL-2 enhanced or possibly BSL-3. In the biosafety world (and even in IBCs) individuals may get too comfortable classifying agents based on biosafety levels without truly understanding how a risk assessment is conducted. It is therefore important to ensure that the IBC is trained and knowledgeable in these concepts. Subject matter experts on the IBC may already be well-versed in the practice of risk assessment, but it is worthwhile to also communicate to community members the process by which risk group is determined, and how this eventually informs what animal biosafety level is used. Depending on how a given agent is being manipulated, risk group classifications may either be raised or lowered and this in turn can affect their stratification in terms of biosafety levels.",

            "text": "ABSL-1 work involves agents that are well characterized and do not pose any substantive danger to healthy individuals who work with or around these agents. These agents pose a minimal risk to the environment and human or animal health. ABSL-1 facilities are typically segregated from the general laboratory population, with some type of restricted access. This applies to areas within a vivarium or satellite ABSL-1 facilities as well. While most work with agents in ABSL-1 settings may be conducted on the open bench top and generally does not require engineering controls, there are certain circumstances where the latter may be needed. This is one area in which risk assessment is particularly important. The biosafety professional -possibly with the help of the IBC -must do a risk assessment on the agents being used, how they are handled and administered and further take into account what type of animal is being used to prescribe specific engineering controls and appropriate levels of PPE. Engineering controls in this case may relate to requiring administration of the agent within a fume hood or regulating the number of air changes in the room per hour, as stipulated by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (henceforth referred to as The Guide), which was developed and is regularly updated by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) [6] .

Sinks and floor drains should be filled with water to prevent sewer gases from entering animal areas, and to prevent the introduction of pests or vermin into these areas [5] . Doors should be self-closing and sealed around their outer edges for similar reasons, and may in some cases have a \"sweep\" around the base of the door to prevent smaller animals -particularly mice -from exiting the room should they escape their cage while being handled or during animal husbandry.

Ventilation within these areas must take into account heat and humidity loads, and these systems should not recirculate exhaust air either within the room or to other animal-containing areas. Exhaust air is considered \"dirty\" and may be contaminated by pathogens or allergens present within the animal areas that could affect both workers and the animals themselves. If it is determined that the potential pathogens present in exhaust air could potentially pose an environmental impact, considerations are made for HEPA filtration. In all animal areas, ranging from ABSL-1 through ABSL-4, it is important to limit the use of horizontal surfaces with regard to both features of the room itself or equipment that is being brought into the area. Such surfaces require much more cleaning, as they tend to accumulate dust and dander, and can act as or facilitate the accumulation of fomites. In this scenario, dust could act as a vehicle for infectious organisms to settle upon; if aerosolized, this fomite could then act as a vehicle for transfer to a new host. PPE can also act as a fomite, which is why gowns, booties, gloves, and other PPE should be removed before leaving a room area, vivarium, or building. It is helpful to conduct a risk assessment and develop SOPs to determine when and where PPE is donned and doffed. It is for this specific reason that laboratory workers are strongly discouraged against bringing their lab coats home, as these may also facilitate transfer of infectious organisms. An animal vivarium should also have a cage-washing system that is capable of reaching a final rinse temperature of 180 F [6] . This applies to either mechanical systems or manual cage washing with chemical disinfecting agents. It is for this reason that most vivariums, especially at larger institutions or facilities, solely use mechanical cage washers for ease of use and efficacy purposes.",

ABSL-2 is suitable for work involving laboratory animals infected with agents that are associated with human disease and pose moderate hazards both to laboratory personnel and the environment [5] . It also addresses hazards from ingestion as well as percutaneous and mucous membrane exposure. Certain training requirements must be met, and this may involve institution-specific training. At a minimum, training for research personnel should include facility procedures, handling of infected animals and training on the actual administration or manipulation of the pathogenic agents being used in animal studies. Personnel knowledgeable of the potential hazards associated with these agents, as well as the relevant animal manipulation and husbandry procedures, should supervise individuals working at ABSL-2. One of the critical differences between ABSL-1 and ABSL-2 is in the introduction of engineering controls for primary containment at ABSL-2, usually in the form of a biosafety cabinet. These could include Class II A2-type biosafety cabinets that mostly exhaust to the room or Class II B1 or B2 biosafety cabinets that exhaust air to the outside at varying percentages. A biosafety cabinet not only provides a sterile working environment when used correctly, but also offers a primary protective barrier for personnel. When a risk assessment determines that an element of containment is needed, elevation of the agent's risk group and an increase of the biosafety level from ABSL-1 to ABSL-2 are indicated through assessing the risk to humans, animal, environment, or other factors specific to the work being conducted. Other engineering controls may also be administered, but the biosafety cabinet is the most common form of primary containment at ABSL-2. The biosafety cabinet also comes into play when manipulating infectious materials or conducting procedures that have the potential to produce aerosols. Biosafety cabinets may also be used for necropsy, harvesting of tissues, or even animal cage changes if required [5] . If a procedure cannot be conducted in a biosafety cabinet, a combination of PPE and other containment strategies must be used, such as using the actual room as primary containment and possibly considering respiratory protection.",

If a reversal of airflow occurs within the supply air plenums due to the failure of exhausts fans, or failure of both supply and exhaust fans, HEPA filtration ensures that this air will not contain any potential contamination from within the ductwork or elsewhere. Directional airflow, air-pressure-resistant doors with gaskets, air locks, effluent decontamination systems, animal renderers, restraint devices, systems that enable pressure decay testing, and the capability to seal any and all access points in the room are just some of the engineering controls that must be implemented at this level. Pressure decay testing is the administering of pressure to a room or ductwork, and observing the pressure differential to determine the presence of leaks.

If the determination can be made that the research, or the purchase or transfer of transgenic animals may be housed at ABSL-1, it is exempt from the NIH guidelines for research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. The creation of transgenic animals involves use of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, which the NIH respectively defines as \"molecules that a) are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules and b) that can replicate in a living cell\" and \"nucleic acid molecules that are chemically or by other means synthesized or amplified, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but, can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules\" [4] . The creation of a transgenic animal typically involves recombinant viral vectors that deliver the transgene that in turn becomes integrated into the genome of the recipient animal. This type of in vivo work may not always result in the creation of a new transgenic animal line, but can instead result in a foreign protein being expressed from the transgene. As with studies involving pathogens, the IBC is required to review the administration of recombinant DNA technologies studies. The IBC must also classify them and determine biosafety levels and containment practices, as well as possible dual use research of concern (DURC), gain of function studies, and major actions. Major actions are experiments or manipulations that involve the deliberate transfer of antibiotic resistance to an organism. The new DURC policy has established guidelines for research that falls under categories deemed dual use research and dual use research of concern that will take effect in September 2015.

Briefly, this includes experiments that do not involve more than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus, use a RG1 agent, and are conducted at ABSL-1 [4] . A typical example of this type of work would be using recombinant adeno-associated viruses to express certain genes or proteins within an animal. In contrast, studies classified as NIH III-D require IBC approval before the work may be initiated. This category of studies uses higher-risk agents for experiments involving genomic integration, either in vitro or in vivo. There are many subcategories of the III-D designation, and the specifics depend on the details of a particular experiment. These subcategories range from III-D-1-a for experiments that involve the introduction of synthetic nucleic acids into RG2 organisms usually conducted at BSL-2 containment, to III-D-7-d which covers antiviral susceptibility and containment.

In these cases, the biosafety professional must send a report to the NIH/OBA office upon becoming aware of the incident. They should also meet with the personnel involved in the incident to determine the sequence of events that led to this release, escape, or exposure. Critical details in this process include identifying the particular breach of primary containment, PPE compromise (especially respiratory protection), deviations from SOPs, the extent of decontamination of the area where the incident took place, and any corrective actions that were taken. When dealing with incidents related to transgenic animals or animals infected with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, it is important to determine whether PPE was compromised and/or if an animal was able to either bite or scratch the individual. In the latter event, it will be necessary for that individual to receive medical care or treatment at a facility approved by the occupational health program. The personnel involved should let the clinic know the sequence of events, describe any breaches in PPE (including respiratory protection), and be forthright in sharing all relevant information so that the clinic may make a determination of the proper medical treatment, if needed. If the incident involves a breach of primary containment in a Select Agent laboratory, correspondence with the CDC and a Form 3 (Report of Theft, Loss, or Release of Select Agents and Toxins) must also be submitted in conjunction with the NIH reporting. The reporting narrative should be communicated to both agencies in a timely manner.

Incidents that are reported to the NIH are public information and should be communicated to the IBC and documented on the IBC agenda and meeting minutes. The IBC plays an important part in determining potential corrective actions. The IBC can be a useful tool for biosafety professionals, as the different areas of expertise and years of experience of committee members may play a vital role in implementing prevention practices. It is important to have a robust reporting process at institutions that conduct work with synthetic nucleic acids, and open lines of communication and well-established relationships between researchers and biosafety professionals are vital to an effective reporting program.",

            "text": "The CDC defines Select Agents and Toxins as biological agents and toxins that could pose a severe threat to public health and safety [5] . A large majority of Select Agent work is conducted in vivo in ABSL-3 or ABSL-4 facilities. Though not part of the original mandate, IBCs are often tasked with Select Agent compliance at research institutions. It is important that specific SOPs be developed for this research, and that all CDC rules and regulations are followed. Many of the practices described above for these animal biosafety levels apply to this type of research. Select Agent research requires sophisticated HVAC systems, restricted access, higher levels of PPE and respiratory protection, medical surveillance, training of personnel in biosafety, biosecurity, and incident response, and having written plans in place. It is also important to maintain animal disposition logs that show when each animal has been infected and when it has been inactivated. Entry into these spaces by approved individuals must be tracked in the form of logs and access records, all of which need to be audited internally. It is important that SOPs for Select Agent labs take into consideration animal biosafety concerns with regard to personnel. These may involve specific PPE requirements, such as puncture-proof gloves if working with sharps or if there are concerns about aggressive animals. On the other hand, over-prescribing PPE may lead to a loss in dexterity or agility, which may result in more harm than benefit. Animal handling, especially with smaller animals, can be a very delicate process where reduced dexterity can compromise the safety of both the animal and the personnel. It is important to take all of these factors into consideration when establishing PPE requirements, and to have a thorough discussion with the lab working with the Select Agent. Many Select Agent experiments may allow use of anesthesia to minimize risks of injury or escape, but not all. For example, some studies conducted with Select Agents may focus on the animal's respiratory or neurological function, such that use of anesthesia may affect the study adversely. In these instances, specific procedures should be developed for animal handling to minimize escape or breach from primary containment in collaboration with the lab, biosafety professionals, and the IBC. The IBC reviews the SOPs for these labs, reviews and approves inactivation protocols, is in charge of Select Agents, and is usually involved with the reporting process if there is a theft, loss, or release of a Select Agent at the institution. The IBC also must be apprised of new labs or Select Agents being implemented at the institution.",

The committee is a repository of knowledge, skills, and expertise in a variety of fields that biosafety professionals and institutions can rely on to conduct research with animals that accommodates the animal's well-being, as well as the safety of the personnel involved in the research. Through the risk assessment process, institutions can determine biosafety levels, prescribe PPE, and select appropriate engineering controls to ensure that a successful animal research program can be implemented and executed. It is important that the IBC plays an active role in overseeing all animal work done at an institution, and the implementation of this committee's decisions in work practices will in turn lead to a safe and successful research program.",
