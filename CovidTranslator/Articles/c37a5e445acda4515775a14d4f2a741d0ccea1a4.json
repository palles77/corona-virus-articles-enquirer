Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from Hubei resembling a L\u00e9vy flight which is characteristic of human mobility and thus could be controlled by efficient quarantines. Since quarantine is usually applied on a city level, more insight can be obtained in analyzing the epidemic in cities. Our results suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is close to constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations. While most Chinese cities control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less control.",

A medical cure from the disease is yet unavailable and the number of infected cases is still increasing (Fig. 1a) . In China, the number of infected individuals exceeds 80000 as for 18 of March 2020 and the virus has already spread to more than 100 countries around the world. Furthermore, the virus shows a mortality rate of 2.5% of all infected persons [1] (4% as for 18 of March 2020), compared to 9.6% in SARS [2] or 0.6% for the H1N1 influenza [3] . This high mortality rate together with the lack of a cure for the COVID-19 virus, are the reasons for the severe restrictions on those that were in contact with COVID-19 confirmed cases, which mainly includes strict quarantine of 14 days. The high mortality rates of COVID-19 are not uniformly distributed through different ages. Rather the mortality rate is as high as 5%-11% for ages over 70 with an increased risk for patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases or cancer [4] .",

Statistical estimations of the incubating (latency) period of the virus which includes no signs of illness vary between different populations and found to be of about 4-6 days [8] while a long incubation period of 19 days has also been observed [9] . The 14 days quarantine period, which has been adopted by many countries, is a result of the higher limit of the 95% confidence levels [10] of this incubating period. Under this quarantine strategy, the virus spreading could be alleviated.",

Although China is the country with most infection cases (as for 18 of March 2020), the disease stopped to spread while in other countries the disease keeps propagating close to exponentially as can be seen in Figs. 1b and 1c. In fact, in most of the cities in China spreading stopped approximately after 20 days as shown in Fig. 1c , in contrast, in other location it is spreading as shown for Italy in Fig. 1d . This suggests that one can learn from the disease decay in China and apply similar measures in other locations in the world. While a general estimation of the disease evolution has been recently conducted [11, 12] , a comprehensive analysis of its spatio-temporal propagation which is important for epidemic forecast, is still missing. In this manuscript, we study the spatiotemporal propagation of the COVID-19 virus and discuss the differences between China and other countries.",

Furthermore, we find strong correlation between the number of infected individuals in each province and the population migration from Hubei to this province. This correlation suggests that the disease propagation is due to human mobility [13, 14] which has been suggested to follow a L\u00e9vy-flight pattern [15] [16] [17] . A reasonable explanation for this correlation can be the strict quarantines applied in most of the cities in China after the shutdown of Wuhan traffic [18, 19] . These quarantines were effective and probably prevented infected individuals to further spread the disease to other cities. Hence, the number of infected individuals is highly correlated to the population migration from Hubei before the shutdown, Fig. 2 .",

Indeed, our results suggest that many cities in China experience a two-stages process of the disease. At early times (of order of few days), the disease was undetectable due to the incubating period and the disease was spreading within the city. At later times, the infected individuals have been quarantined and the disease started to decay approximately exponentially in many cities. The quarantines have been effective to extinct the disease inside a city and reach a stable state with close to zero infection rate. Since quarantines were applied almost at the same time in most of the cities in China, we find that the decay stage of the disease starts almost at the same time for most of the cities no matter if they are large central cities, small cities or even Hubei province cities. For the same reason most of the cities experience a similar 10-20 days characteristic time of the disease drastic reduction. Note that usually quarantines are applied on a city scale, thus, studying the disease decay on a country scale might lead to uncertain conclusion regarding the disease situation since the disease may propagate in one city and decay in another.",

The approximately constant infection rate in early times represents the real infection rate of the disease before quarantines were applied to control the disease while the exponential decay in later times represents the efficiency of quarantines to the infected rate. The smaller the parameter \u03c4 indicate more efficient restrictions. The constant value t x is very similar in different cities in China due to the similar emergency response of other provinces with respect to the epidemic outbreak (see SI). If indeed the decay is exponential and not power-law it indicates that quarantines are efficient to tame the disease since exponential decay has characteristic time and indeed, in the last days the infection rate is zero and no new cases are found as seen in Fig. 3 . While the latency period is assumed to be l = 4 when calculating P (t), it seems that changing this value does not change the general behaviour and only slightly changes \u03c4 and P 0 (see SI).

            "text": "The COVID-19 is spreading world-wide but stopped spreading in China. Since the spread of the disease is highly related to population migration, it follows a L\u00e9vy flight behavior which is characteristic of human mobility [20] . The long incubating period together with the L\u00e9vy flight long jumps makes the disease very hard to control and raise the alarm for the other countries. By the time that infected individual is being detectable, one can already perform a long-distance trip and further spread the disease. In fact, the strong relation of population migration and the disease spreading indicates that early quarantine of Hubei province could prevent the worldwide spreading. This is the reason why quarantines are so critical not only for infected persons, but also for others that were nearby infected individuals. The lifetime of the disease in a city is characterized by two stages, uncontrolled infection in early times and decaying stage at later times once quarantines are being performed. These two stages can explain the disease situation in China and predict the situation in other locations in the world if similar strategies will be adopted. The stage of the disease in China is almost stable although it is the country with most of infection cases (as for 18 of March 2020). The reasoning is that most of the infected cities in China applied strict quarantine measures, leading to exponential decay of disease. However, in other locations around the world, most of the cities are still at the early stages at which the disease is less controlled and may lead to another or even worse outbreak at high risks.",
