This system was applied to develop a quantitative measurement of cell-cell fusion using hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease and a secretion-blocked EGFP-4A/4B-SEAP (EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; 4A/4B: a decapeptide substrate of NS3/4A protease; SEAP: secreted alkaline phosphatase) fusion gene. Both genes were transiently expressed in either of the CHO cell lines, followed by fusion treatment. Significant SEAP activity could be detected in the culture medium only after cell-cell fusion occurred. Cell-cell fusion provides an environment in which the protease encounters its substrate 4A/ 4B, thereby releasing SEAP from the fusion protein. In this study, we developed a simple, sensitive, and quantitative assay to study the membrane fusion process by measuring the extracellular activity of SEAP.",

            "text": "The use of hepatitis C virus NS3/4A and secreted alkaline phosphatase to quantitate cell-cell membrane fusion mediated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus S protein and the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 Cellular membrane fusion is an essential process for cell physiology in a eukaryotic system. It is crucial for intracellular trafficking, cell secretion, exo-and endocytosis, and the entry of enveloped animal viruses. In cell biology, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) 1 have been implicated in membrane fusion for more than a decade [1] and have been greatly elucidated. Correspondingly, enveloped viruses, such as human immunodeficiency, influenza, herpes, vaccinia, and hepatitis C viruses, have been widely studied for the mechanisms of their cellular entry. Each of these viruses can unload its genome into the host cytoplasm through the virus-cell membrane fusion process to initiate the viral replication cycle. The entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a recently identified human coronavirus [2] , is also a membrane fusion-dependent event mediated by the virion surface spike (S) protein and its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 0003-2697/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2007 Elsevier Inc. All (ACE2) [3, 4] . As demonstrated in our previous study, the cellular surface expressions of both recombinant proteins can be used to mimic the membrane fusion process and provide a safe and simple assay for characterizing the abilities of anti-S monoclonal antibodies to block viral infection [5] . In the current study, we used noninfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and further develop this system to allow accurate quantification of the cell-cell membrane fusion process.",

            "text": "As a highly sensitive reporter with low background from the endogenous alkaline phosphatase, secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) secretion into the culture medium was used for quantitative analysis of membrane fusion without interfering cellular activity. The secretion could be blocked when SEAP was tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the N terminus. A protease substrate linker between EGFP and SEAP was designed for releasing the phosphatase, whereas the linker (a decapeptide 4A/4B at the boundary of hepatitis C virus [HCV] 4A and 4B genes) is accessible to the protease. HCV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus; its genome encodes a unique polyprotein precursor that must be processed by proteases to produce individual viral proteins. HCV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), a serine-type protease, and the cofactor NS4A [6] are required for the cleavage at junctions of NS proteins (except of NS2/3) within the polyprotein [7] and were used to unblock the tagged SEAP by cutting the linker 4A/4B. In this study, the quantitative method was developed by expressing the protease NS3/4A and the EGFP-tagged SEAP in different fusion partner CHO cells. When two CHO stable cell lines (CHO-SG and CHO-ACE2 are constitutively expressing either S or ACE2 fusion modulators) were transiently transfected, mixed, and treated with trypsin, the formation of syncytium was observed. The extracellular activity of SEAP could be measured due to the accessibility of NS3/ 4A protease to its recognition sequence.",

C2C12, 293 and Cos7 (ATCC) cell lines were cultured at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1 g L \u00c01 glucose, 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 streptomycin, 100 U ml \u00c01 penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone), in addition to 1 mg ml \u00c01 G418 (Gibco/BRL) for the stable cell lines. The constructions of CHO-SG and CHO-ACE2 were described previously [5, 8] . The HCV E2 gene (the ectodomain of E2 protein from HCV polyprotein amino acid sequence 364-673) was amplified from the template HCV-S1 [9] (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] accession no. AF356827) with primers E2F (5 0 -GCAGATCTGCCACCatggtggggaactgggctaag-3 0 ) and E2R (5 0 -GCatttaaatTCTGCCACTCTGTCGTAGAC-3 0 ). The PCR fragment was double digested with BglII/SwaI and inserted into the plasmid pEGFP-N1-S-EGFP [8] with the same treatment. The ectodomain of S-EGFP was replaced with the ectodomain of E2 to produce E2-EGFP, and the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains plus 20 amino acid residues in the outward juxtamembrane region of S protein were fused with the E2 protein. Stable cell lines of CHO-E2G, C2C12-E2G, and C2C12-SG were established by using lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as the transfection reagent and G418 for the selection. High-yield clones were selected by using a fluorescence microscope fitted with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter.",

GS and its leucine mutants, GSK and GSR, all expressed near the basal level of extracellular SEAP activity, indicating that the 4A/4B linker might not be readily accessible to the protease, probably because it is too close to the hydrophobic core of the SEAP signal peptide or the hydrophobic region at the EGFP C terminus (Fig. 4) . Indeed, when NS3/4A was cotransfected with GDS, a significant amount of SEAP activity that was detected in the culture supernatant was contributed by the extra octapeptide. Cotransfection of NS3/4A with the leucine mutation GDS derivatives, GDSG, GDSE, and GDSR, also yielded significant levels of extracellular SEAP activities, but the levels were lower than those with GDS. The cleavage activity of NS3/4A to GS or GDS was determined using Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B) ; the protease presented partial activity to GS, whereas the digestion to GDS was nearly completed. The expression levels of GS and GDS were also different, with the loading of GS samples in Fig. 3B being five times less than that of GDS samples.",

In Fig. 5 , the SEAP activity from GS or GDS cotransfected with NS3/4A or GDS alone was compared among CHO, 293, and Cos7 cells. SEAP released from GDS by NS3/ 4A in CHO cells was significantly greater than that in 293 and Cos7 cells. Therefore, CHO-ACE2 and CHO-SG cells expressing NS3/4A and GDS, respectively, were chosen for the development of a quantitative assay of the cellcell membrane fusion process (see below). In GSK/R constructs, the fourth amino acid residue X indicates mutations from leucine to lysine or arginine. In GDS/X constructs, the X represents glycine, glutamic acid, and arginine. GDS construct was intercalated with an octapeptide (DEDEDEDE) upstream of 4A/4B. CHO-SG or CHO-E2G cells transfected with NS3/4A. A high level of extracellular SEAP was detected in the culture supernatant from the mixed cultures of CHO-ACE2 (+ GDS) and CHO-SG (+NS3/4A) after trypsin treatment (Fig. 6) , indicating that the fusion between CHO-ACE2 and CHO-SG (see Fig. 1 ) allowed the NS3/4A protease to access and cleave the 4A/4B linker in GDS. As would be expected, there was no significant secretion of SEAP into the media from the mixed cultures of transfected CHO-ACE2 with either the negative control (NS3/4A transfected CHO-E2G) or NS3/4A transfected CHO-SG cells without trypsin treatment. This result indicates clearly that NS3/4A and GDS could be used for the quantitative measurement of cell-cell membrane fusion.",

The sequence of GS was analyzed using the TMpred service (www.ch.embnet.org) for predicting possible transmembrane regions. The signal peptide (MLLLLLLLG LRLQLSLGI) of SEAP was strongly indicated as a transmembrane domain that may affect accessibility to the linker sequence for protease digestion. On the other hand, a range of 19 amino acid residues (219-237) at the EGFP C terminus was also suggested as a possible transmembrane domain; although EGFP is known as a cytoplasmic protein, its behavior may be different as in a fusion protein. To increase the accessibility of the linker to protease activity, we first tried to make a minimum modification by mutating one amino acid residue in the SEAP signal peptide to abolish the putative transmembrane domain while maintaining the signal peptide. An analysis of the 18 amino acid residues comprising the signal sequence using the program SignalP 3.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/ services/SignalP) suggested changing the fourth residue, leucine, to either lysine (GSK) or arginine (GSR). However, these modifications did not increase the extracellular SEAP activity; in fact, they could only hinder the process by decreasing the secretion efficiency of GDSG, GDSE, and GDSR (Fig. 3A) .",

Because there are four negatively charged amino acid residues in 4A/4B, a negatively charged octapeptide was designed by composing Asp and Glu amino acid residues for limiting the interaction with 4A/4B and for making extra distance between 4A/4B and the hydrophobic region of EGFP. The Protean program in DNASTAR was used to compare the predicted hydrophilicity and surface probability of GS, GSK, and GDS (Fig. 4) ; the inserted octapeptide in GDS indeed increased the computed profiles for the region and possibly increased the protease accessibility. The result of cotransfected (GDS and NS3/4A) CHO cells supports our view of the accessibility; however, the octapeptide might not be the optimum. Some CHO-GDS stable clones still expressed a basal level of extracellular SEAP while they were transfected with NS3/4A (see Supplementary  Fig. 3) , and the secretion of SEAP from GDS and NS3/ 4A cotransfected 293 and Cos7 cells was insignificant. The parameters of the octapeptide could possibly be changed in length or modified with other hydrophilic amino acid residues. The cellular fusion between CHO-ACE2 and C2C12-SG cells is more drastic than that between CHO-ACE2 and CHO-SG cells, but the quantitation was limited by the low transfection efficiency of C2C12 cells. In addition, a promoter strong enough to drive the transient expression for either NS3/4A or GDS in C2C12 cells for the quantitative measurement is not available in our laboratory. We also established CHO-NS3/4A and CHO-GDS stable cell lines for the cell-cell membrane fusion quantitative studies, but the transient expressions of either S or ACE2 were not sufficient to perform the process significantly. By making use of the protease activity of the HCV NS3 protein and designing a novel EGFP-4A/4B-SEAP substrate, GDS, we have developed a quantitative assay for the membrane fusion process between SARS-CoV S and its cellular receptor, ACE2. Such a quantitative system could be useful for analyzing the fine details of this important step in the SARS-CoV life cycle and could also provide a safe and simple assay for high-throughput screening to identify inhibitors that can stop the virus at this crucial step. Similarly, the assay could be adapted for the study of the membrane fusion process for other enveloped viruses.",

The macrocyclic inhibitor BILN 2061 was identified using a substratebased approach to designing inhibitors of the HCV NS3 active site [13] , and subsequently identified inhibitors and NS3 mutants [13] [14] [15] [16] all were based on the studies using the replicon system. The quantitative method using NS3/ 4A and GDS could be used as the alternative way to screen for HCV NS3 inhibitors in vivo [10, 11] or to facilitate the studies of NS3 drug-resistant mutants by quantitative measurement. In this article, we have presented cell-cell membrane fusion mediated by two stable CHO cell lines expressing recombinant SARS-CoV S protein and human ACE2 individually. Moreover, the fusion process was used as a model for developing a quantitative measurement of extracellular SEAP via the transient expressions of HCV NS3/4A protease and GDS (secretion blocked SEAP) from these cell lines separately.",
