Although community associated disease has been described in the 80's, it is only in this decade that it has been recognised as an important cause of infectious diarrhoea in patients in the community. As C. difficile was mostly recognised as a nosocomial pathogen, the majority of studies of clinical C. difficile infections (CDI) have been conducted in acute care hospitals, and many have been performed during outbreak situations. The hospital environment has very specific characteristics which are likely to be important determinants of infectious disease occurrence and transmission, such as clustering of susceptible hosts, increased possibility of environmental contamination, physical proximity and multiple person to person contacts. Similarly, the demographics of hospitalized patients population also differ significantly from that of the community. In hospitals, the prevalence of antibiotic use is very high, and highly correlated with many other factors which could be important in the expression of CDI. Until recently antibiotics were believed to be a prerequisite for the development of CDI but studies of community acquired disease are consistently describing disease occurring in a high proportion of patients who have no such exposure. This has lead to research examining other risk factors. CDI appears to be increasing in the community especially in the elderly, but also in the pediatric population. As up to 50% of CDI in the community may not be precceded by recent antibiotic exposure particularly in patients without a recent hospitalization, many of the recommended diarrhea testing alogarithms will result in this diagnosis being missed or delayed. This could have important implications for patient care and control of outbreaks. Well designed studies of C. difficile in the community could improve our understanding of this disease and improve the ability to explore other risk factors and where antibiotic exposure maybe less confounded.",

Covalent modifications of histones through acetylation at Lysine residues strongly influence the structure and the function of the chromatin. Whereas acetylation of histones results in a relaxed chromatin structure that is associated with active transcription, de-acetylation of histones results in a compacted chromatin structure associated with repressed transcription. Global histone acetylation is regulated by the opposing actions of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Beside histones, non histones proteins are modified by reversible acetylation, among which a-tubulin, HSP90 and transcription regulators. Therefore, HDACs impact on many biological functions, primarily cell differentiation, growth and survival. HDAC inhibitors (HDIs) were originally developed for their powerful anti-cancer activity. Yet, recent preclinical studies suggest that HDIs possess antiinflammatory activity. Based on these observations, we postulated that HDIs could impact on innate immune response to microbial infection. Here we will discuss the results from our studies on the effect of HDIs on the innate immune system. We first performed genome-wide gene expression analyses to have a global view of the impact of HDIs on the transcriptome of resting and microbial product-stimulated primary macrophages. We then studied the influence of HDIs on key parameters (activation of the intracellular signal transduction pathways, production of cytokines and chemokines, expression of co-stimulatory and chemokine receptors..) of macrophages, dendritic cells and whole blood activated by a broad range of microbial products. Finally, we analyzed the impact of HDIs in preclinical models of non-severe bacterial and fungal infections, toxic shock and severe sepsis.",

Nowadays IA diagnosis is based on extensive use of galactomannan (GM) and high-resolution chest tomography (HRCT). Despite the fact positive GM has prompted an earlier treatment of IA, mortality is still high in this population showing that other diagnostic approaches should be taken into account. Detection of nucleic acids, PCR-based methods mainly, appears to be an option to assess although to date there are many doubts as to the profitability of this type of methods. Diagnostic PCR must be considered an additional test that is being developed and that is used in some reference laboratories. Its lack of standardization should be stressed, since different laboratories use different approaches in terms of extraction, probes, primers, PCR conditions, and measurement. Furthermore the benefit of detecting DNA of Aspergillus fumigatus depends on the clinical sample used. PCR techniques have shown high diagnostic reliability in tissue biopsies and respiratory samples with high negative predictive values and discreet positive predictive values, but lower diagnostic reliability has been obtained in blood samples. Those high negative predictive values could be useful to rule out the presence of infection. Newer approaches such as serial determinations of Aspergillus DNA in serum or blood, and detection of fungal DNA in higher volumes of blood have shown a greater diagnostic applicability, which increases when combined with GM quantification and high-resolution chest tomography. Those approaches have had higher rates of both sensitivity and specificity and improved the early diagnosis of aspergillosis.",

Meis (Utrecht, Nijmegen, NL) Our understanding of causative agents of fungal diseases has changed considerably during recent years. This is mainly due to the large scale introduction of molecular studies, in which one or more stretches of DNA are compared across a wide range of fungi, including human and animal pathogens. One of the most striking discoveries was the recognition of Pneumocystis as a fungus, as this organism was considered previously to belong to the parasites. In many cases traditional 'species' turned out to represent species complexes and many of the newly recognized clinically relevant species may differ in the susceptibility to commonly used antifungals. Therefore, correct identification of these new pathogens is important for proper patient management. A brief overview will be presented of these developments in fungal taxonomy and their implications for the clinical practice. Examples will be given from the main lineages of the fungal kingdom, namely Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes (Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Candida spp.) and Basidiomycetes (Malassezia, Trichosporon and Cryptococcus spp.). Due to our own experience with the basidiomycetous yeasts we will give more in depth information on these fungi. The number of recognized species is rapidly increasing due to the application of molecular systematics and the availability of a large database of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences, most notable the D1/D2 domains of the LSU rDNA and the ITS 1 and 2 regions. Only a few species are generally recognized as important pathogens for humans and animals, including Cryptococcus neoformans and Cr. gattii, several Trichosporon species and Malassezia spp. However, several non-conventional basidiomycetous yeast species can cause infection or are otherwise involved in health problems, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We will present data on the involvement of these emerging basidiomycetous species, such as C. adeliensis, C. diffluens, C. flavescens and C. laurentii in human diseases. Emphasis will be on the Cr. neoformans-Cr. gattii and Malassezia species complexes, especially the role of the newly recognized species in disease, virulence, and susceptibility to antifungals.",

Several molecular typing techniques have been developed for fungi. Ideally, typing results should be accurate, reproducible, and easy to interpret. Importantly, methods should be transferable to other settings. Many typing methods such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, restriction fragment length polymorphism, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and amplified fragment length polymorphism yield fingerprint profiles that are difficult to reproduce in different settings. In contrast, two methods have emerged for clinical applications as providing reliable, portable and easy to obtain data: microsatellite markers and Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). Microsatellites, or short tandem repeats, are defined as tandemly repetitive stretches of two to five nucleotides. After amplification, PCR products are analyzed based on amplicon length. The present limitation of microsatellite typing is transferability. A straightforward and universally applicable method to achieve such a calibration is through the use of allelic ladders. MLST is based on sequencing several housekeeping genes. Active MLST schemes are publicly available (http://www.mlst.net/) for yeasts. The main advantage of MLST is the ability to provide indisputable data based on sequencing. However, MLST is laborious, based on the quality of the sequences, has a long turn-around time and is associated with significant costs. The nosocomial acquisition of invasive infections has been investigated. The conclusion are disappointing for invasive aspergillosis but unambiguous for invasive candidiasis. However, genotyping itself is not sufficient. Sampling, collection of clinical and epidemiological data are compulsory to reach a meaningful conclusion. Another interesting point is the propagation of a given clone with a resistant phenotype. This has already been investigated for Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida tropicalis.",

Nevertheless, long-term outcomes secondary to HIV infection are now serious concerns, like non-infectious cardiovascular complications including cardiomegaly, pericarditis, myocarditis and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The lung is the most frequent target organ for disorders associated with HIV infection, and the cardiopulmonary vascular system can be sometimes involved; indeed, HIV-related pulmonary arterial hypertension (HRPAH) affects more HIV-infected individuals (i.e. 0.5%) than uninfected (i.e., 1 to 2 cases per million people). The average age of HRPAH patients is 33 years, although the range can span from infancy to old age. There is no trend between HRPAH and HIV viral loads or CD4+ T cell counts but is more severe in AIDS patients. Shortness of breath is the most common symptom, and a clinical, cardiological, radiological work up is required for diagnosis. Cardiac catheterisation is the gold standard for the final diagnosis, and is mandatory to characterize the disease and exclude secondary causes.",

However, viral proteins and its interactions with molecular partners in the infected host are strong candidates for cause-effect relationships because they may promote apoptosis, growth and proliferation. At least three of the HIV proteins are implicated in the pathology of PAH: the HIV envelope glycoprotein-120 (Env), the HIV protein Tat and HIV Nef (negative factor). Nef impairs vasomotor functions in pulmonary artery cells, decreases the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and increases oxidative stress, suggesting a strong role in the formation of plexiform lesions in the lung vasculature. The role of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HRPAH is still debated. From a literature review, survival rates are 69% and 38% among patients treated or not with ART and specific therapy for PAH, respectively (p = 0.02), thus suggesting that specific therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension should be strongly recommended in these patients. The role of the combination treatment with antiretrovirals in influencing the outcome of HRPAH is controversial, even if some evidences seem to indicate a beneficial effect in the clinical course of the disease.

Dengue sero-prevalence: Acute seroconversion for dengue virus infection was demonstrated in 4/324 (1.2%) of travellers tested. This translates to an incidence of 4.17 dengue virus infections per 10,000 days of travel (95% CI 1.7-10.7). A further 13 travellers (4%) were positive for dengue IgG prior to travel indicating past exposure. Travellers with acute dengue infection had travelled to China (n = 2) India (n = 1) and Thailand (n = 1), and two of these travellers had received the JE vaccine. Influenza seroprevalence: 4/324 (1.2%) had evidence of recent influenza infection. The incidence of influenza virus infections is 4.17 per 10,000 days of travel (95% CI 1.7-10.7). JE sero-prevalence: There was no acute JE seroconversion in this cohort. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective study estimating the incidence of both respiratory and arboviral infections in travellers. For travellers to Asia, the risk of acquiring dengue in an inter-epidemic period is low (incidence density 4.17 infections per 10,000 days of travel). The risk of acquiring influenza in this well vaccinated cohort was equally as low and no JE infections were observed. These findings have important implications for practitioners advising prospective travellers.",

Extensive data from the molecular characterisation of intestinal protists are necessary if PCR-based diagnosis is to detect all genetic variants of intestinal parasites especially if the eventual aim is for it to substitute for morphology-based methods. Diagnostic PCRs are very often based on amplification of the Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, partly due to the fact that this gene is present in a high-copy number.

Since a timely and appropriate therapy is needed for severe P aeruginosa infections, clinicians should be aware of the risk factors associated with this pathogen and with multidrug resistance. There is still debate if a combination or a monotherapy should be instituted for Ps. aeruginosa infections. The use of combination therapies for Ps. aeruginosa pneumonia has been a long-advocated practice, but the potential increased value of New horizons in the diagnosis of bacterial sepsis S13 combination therapy over monotherapy remains controversial. However, empirical combination therapy maximizes the chances of bacterial coverage, especially in severe infections, and likely exerts a lower resistance selection pressure. Upon confirmation of Ps. aeruginosa infection, treatment should be given according to the site of infection, the pathophysiology of the patient, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of the antimicrobials, and the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, including the MIC values. For strains that are resistant to all antimicrobials but colistin, this antimicrobial is advocated as the choice option either in mono-or in combination therapy. Indeed, since there are no novel antibiotics in the drug development pipeline for multidrug-resistant Ps. aeruginosa, old antibiotics, such as the polymyxins (ie, colistin, also known as polymyxin E and polymyxin B), have re-emerged as the last resort therapy. However, current clinical use of colistin is largely informed by inadequate and, in some cases inaccurate, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. Rifampin, sulbactam, carbapenems, fosfomycin are all possible options for combination treatment, due to their in vitro synergistic effect. Among carbapenems, doripenem seems to possess a lower potential for resistance selection and a more favourable pharmacokinetic profile. Newer anti-pseudomonal antibacterials are expected to be available in the near future.

However, alternatives are needed because carbapenem-resistance due to carbapenemases and other mechanisms are increasing worldwide. For the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis due to ESBL producers, observational studies showed high cure rates with oral fosfomycin, nitrofurantoine, and amoxicillin-clavulatane when a susceptible isolate was involved. Mecillinam, which is stable against ESBLs, is also a potential option. For patients with other types of infections including complicated urinary tract infections, the options are more limited. Some isolates may show low MIC to specific cephalosporins depending on the type of ESBL produced; PK/PD data suggest that these infections can be treated with these cephalosporins (particularly cefepime) using appropriate doses, but this practice is not recommended for empirical therapy because the MIC cannot be predicted. Adding an aminoglycoside to a standard regimen is a reasonable option for selected patients at low risk of renal toxicity in areas where prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance among ESBLproducers is low. The efficacy of combinations of cephalosporins with b-lactamase inhibitors (as cefoperazone-sulbactam, or as the combination of a cephalosporin and amoxicillin/clavulatane) and temocillin are to be studied in different clinical settings. However, the worldwide spread of the multi-drug resistant clones of E. coli and K. pneumoniae further reduce the therapeutic options, for which only carbapenems, tigecycline and colistin might be active. While older drugs, such as fosfomycin (probably in combination), merit being investigated in systemic infections, new drugs active against these organisms are clearly needed.

Giamarellou\u00b0(Athens, GR) Resistance to carbapenems due to the production of metallo-b-lactamases (MBL) or KPC enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae is an increasing international public health problem. An MDR or even an PDR phenotype is associated with carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, because these strains usually harbor mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycosides and quinolones, as well. Nevertheless, some of these strains often exhibit low-level resistance to carbapenems with MICs remaining in the susceptible range rendering the therapeutic role of carbapenems questionable. The armamentarium against PDR Gram-negative microorganisms has almost been exhausted. The only options left are colistin, an antibiotic introduced in the 1950s, and tigecycline, a modified minocycline. Monotherapy or combination therapy with colistin is most often used but recently, the emergence of colistin-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae has limited our therapeutic options even further. There is accumulated evidence on the in vivo activity of tigecycline against MDR Enterobacteriaceae but the low levels of the drug achieved in blood indicate the necessity of a higher dose in case of bacteraemia. Some of the MBL or KPC producing Enterobacteriae are in vitro susceptible to fosfomycin. Clinical experience in the setting of serious infections by carbapenemase-producing bacteria is still limited. Finally, combination regimens have very often been used empirically in clinical practice although scientific evidence on the advantages of combinations is usually scarce with the exception of carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae, for which clinical data suggest that the combination of meropenem and gentamicin could be active in vivo, in the case of meropenem MIC 2 mg/ml. The emergence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae highlights the \"end of antibiotics\". Concentrated efforts are needed to preserve and wisely use the few options available.

PCR-assays can also be used for direct detection of pathogens in blood. Such PCRs can be aimed at specific pathogens, or be more broad-range, in which case the PCR is followed by sequencing of the PCR product for identification. PCR can also be used for quantification of the amount of bacterial DNA in blood; several studies point to the value of the bacterial DNA load (BDL) in blood as a marker of severity of infection. This has been shown for pneumococci and meningococci in particular, and there is anecdotal evidence that BDL also correlates with severity of infection in staphylococcal infections. Interpretation of the results of PCR applied directly on blood samples needs further study, however, because several aspects of the kinetics of the presence of bacterial DNA in blood during infection are still unknown. In particular, we must be aware that it is difficult to define the best gold standard for bacteraemia, that PCR detects DNA, rather than living pathogens, that there is always a risk of contamination, and that little is known yet about background bacterial DNA in blood.",

Early diagnosis of sepsis followed by prompt appropriate treatment improves the prognosis of septic patients. It has been suggested that nucleic-acid-based technology such as PCR is more sensitive and can also shorten the time to result when compared with conventional blood culture techniques. To date, however, little is known about the kinetics and the clinical and therapeutic relevance of bacterial DNA present in the blood of patients with sepsis over time in the course of an invasive blood stream infection. The recent introduction of more standardized new PCR-based diagnostic assays including tests that provide a more exact quantitative measurement of DNA, therefore, may open a window of opportunity for a better understanding of the kinetics and clinical significance of microbial DNA circulating in the blood of patients during a blood stream infection. In fact, the potential influence of bacterial DNA on the severity and outcome of blood stream infections is underlined by the findings of recent clinical and laboratory studies suggesting that procalcitonin plasma levels and SOFA scores were significantly higher, length of ICU and hospital stay were longer, and survival was clearly decreased in subgroups of septic patients revealing positive findings in both PCR testing and blood culture. Whether a better insight into the clinical significance of DNAemia will indeed contribute to more rapid initiation of better-tailored therapy and improved management of septic patients in conjunction with other laboratory markers, however, awaits further evaluation of in laboratory studies and interventional clinical trials.

Similarly, most of the polyarticular non infectious arthritis may appear as monarticular. In many clinical situations extra-articular manifestations may differentiate infectious from non infectious arthritis. The recent development of new technology for culture and molecular biology has permitted to recognise virus or bacteria into the joints of degenerative, inflammatory and of course, in infectious arthritis. Reactive arthritis (ReA) is the conceptual ground somewhere between septic arthritis and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The fact that some arthritis (Whipple, SAPHO etc) now have been recognised as infectious arthritis and may respond to antibiotic treatment, as prompted to treat a number of patients with arthritis of \"unknown aetiology\" with antimicrobials. Form a practical point of view the answer to the question \"When are arthritis real infections?\" may be \"When we can treat and cure the infection\". Three aetiologies are involved in most or the patients with acute monarticular arthritis; mechanical, infections and microcrystallines. Inflammatory arthritis may also present as monarticular arthritis. But besides that, more than 20 different non infectious diseases can produce acute arthritis (\"pseudoseptic\" arthritis\"). The tools for the diagnosis of arthritis are limited. As a matter of fact in Rheumatology the \"pattern\" of the disease is particularly important; what joints are involved, what is the sequence, the accompanying symptoms or even the duration of the disease. There are no definitive laboratory markers (except crystals and cultures in the synovial fluid).

            "text": "The hypothesis of an infectious origin for autoimmune diseases has received great attention during the recent years. Microbial agents or viruses can induce autoimmune diseases by a variety of mechanisms. For example, proteins of certain infectious agents can act as polyclonal activators on unique lymphocyte subsets. Viruses can preferentially infect/destroy a particular T cell subset, leading to an imbalance in the immune response. In other instances, infectious agents can up-regulate Th1 cytokines, thereby increasing selected expression of molecules such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins, as well as activation of costimulatory molecules. Several microbial agents have been found to encode superantigens that can selectively activate subsets of T cells. Microbes can also direct the release of cytokines and chemokines, which can act as growth, differentiation, or chemotactic factors for different Th populations and regulate expression of MHC class I and class II molecules. On the other hand, the healthy immune system is tolerant to the molecules of which the body is composed of. However, one can find that among the major antigens recognized during a wide variety of bacterial viral and parasitic diseases, many belong to conserved protein families, sharing extensive sequence identity or conformational fits, with host's molecules, namely molecular mimicry. Antigenic similarity of either molecules' linear amino-acid sequences or their conformational structure between antigens of infectious agents and host tissues might trigger an immune response against the shared determinant. As a result, the tolerance to autoantigens breaks down, and the pathogen-specific immune response that is generated cross-react with host structures to cause tissue damage and disease. In this presentation, the cases of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and the antiphospholipid syndrome, among others, will be reviewed as clear examples of autoimmune diseases where an infectious origin is postulated.",

This reflects the success of both innate and adaptive host responses to pneumococci. The presence of a variety of virulence factors including polysaccharide capsule and pneumolysin challenges the host response. Epithelial cells sense microbial products and release cytokines in response to pneumococci in the lower respiratory tract. Soluble factors, including complement factors, activated through both the classical and alternative pathway, play an important contribution to host defence in the lung. Alveolar macrophages play a critical role as the resident phagocytes in the lung clearing bacteria from the lung and orchestrating the inflammatory response. Once resident defence becomes compromised an inflammatory response including the recruitment of neutrophils becomes essential to microbial control but comes at the potential cost of compromising lung homeostasis. The regulation of this process also requires macrophage competence to ensure a limited inflammatory response which results in bacterial clearance but without lung injury. During the evolution of pulmonary infection a number of critical transition points occur when specific molecules and host responses are critical in determining how the infection evolves and what the outcome of infection will be. The infectious inoculum, the virulence of the pathogen and host susceptibility determines the position of these transitions and the relative role of key host defence strategies. There is increasing recognition of the role of T-cells, B-cells and dendritic cells in the pulmonary response to pneumococci. The integration of these various host responses to pneumococci, in most cases, represents a paradigm which provides a template for successful host responses to pathogenic pulmonary bacteria.",

Barocchi (Siena, IT) S. pneumoniae is part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora but it can become pathogenic causing a variety of diseases, which range from otitis media and sinusitis to pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. Due to its intimate relationship with the human host, S. pneumoniae has evolved a series of strategies to vary its genetic repertoire to evade the host immune response. Using their ability to recombine DNA acquired from the environment, S. pneumoniae strains are able to renew their dispensable genome (i.e. those regions of the genome that are not shared by all isolates). Dispensable genes are frequently acquired and lost, causing a loss of correlation between the phylogenetic history of strains and the presence of genes encoding proteins with antigenic properties. As a consequence these organisms have access to a genetic repertoire \u2212 the pan-genome \u2212 that is larger than the genome of any component strain. At the species level the pan-genome of S. pneumoniae grows as the number of sequenced strains increases due to the influx of genetic material from closely related species, and the mode of this growth positions the pneumococcal species on the edge between open and closed pan-genome. A second strategy for antigenic variation is shown by the evolution of pili, long filamentous appendages involved in adhesion to host cells. Pili are encoded in the rlrA islet, a 12 kb genomic region, that consists of the rlrA transcriptional regulator, rrgA, rrgB and rrgC, coding for LPXTG proteins forming the structure of the pilus, and srtB, srtC and srtD, coding for sortase enzymes catalyzing the pilus polymerization reaction. Due to their exposure to the host immune response, rrgA and rrgB are under positive selection that causes an increased rate of fixation of new alleles, and exist in three distinct clades that correlate with the MLST designation of the strains. Instead the rrgC, srtB, srtC and srtD genes, coding for proteins not directly exposed to the host immune system, are not under positive selection. In the region containing these genes, there is evidence of homologous recombination, and 4 major recombination hotspots can be identified. Due to the homogenizing effect of recombination these genes, differently from the major structural components of the pilus, are well conserved at the sequence level. In addition, piliated strains of Pneumococcus have been associated with multi-drug resistance cassets that may provide S. pneumoniae added fitness.",

WHO estimates that annually at least one million children under 5 years of age die of infections caused by this pathogen. The more than 90 different capsular serotypes make it difficult to design a preventive strategy with universal pneumococcal coverage. In 1983, a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine was marketed, being effective against invasive pneumococcal bloodstream infections in adults. Unfortunately, this vaccine proved low immunogenic in children due to it's T-cell independent type of immuneprotection. In 2000, a new 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed in the USA, protecting very well against invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) caused by vaccine serotypes, also in infants and young children. However, within the years following implementation of PCV7, in addition to a serious drop in vaccine serotype diseases, a significant increase in IPD caused by non-vaccine serotypes was observed. The impact of this so called 'replacement' disease on the total incidence of IPD seems to vary by population and country. Recently, two extended pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been approved for use in children and adults, covering most of the currently 'emerging serotypes'. In this presentation, the following topics will be addressed; What most likely causes 'replacement' disease: vaccine pressure, 'unmasking' of non-vaccine serotypes, secular trends or a combination of those? Do we expect the new extended conjugate vaccines to solve the issue of 'replacement' disease? Do we expect in addition to shifts within IPD causing serotypes also shifts in diseases caused by other respiratory bacteria? What are potential new vaccine candidates, and what do we expect of those vaccines with respect to impact on pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal diseases?",

Postmortem studies showed a continuum between S16 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations bronchitis and pneumonia in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The progression from colonization to VAT, and in some cases to VAP depends on quantity and virulence of the bacterial pathogen, and host lung defenses. VAT is common in mechanically ventilated patients. Its incidence ranges from 3\u221210% of ICU patients. Definition of VAT is matter of debate. Our group defined VAT using all the following criteria: fever (>38\u00baC) with no other recognizable cause, purulent sputum production, positive culture of respiratory specimen at significant threshold, and no radiographic signs of new pneumonia. Portable chest radiograph is inaccurate in diagnosing new infiltrates in mechanically ventilated patients. Therefore, differentiating VAT from VAP could be a difficult task in ICU patients. VAT is frequently caused by Gram-negative bacilli, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although several studies investigated risk factors for VAP, few have evaluated risk factors for VAT. However, risk factors for these infections appear to be similar. Age >60 years, COPD, prior antimicrobial treatment and surgery were identified as risk factors for VAT. Tracheobronchitis is characterized by lower respiratory tract inflammation and increased sputum production. These factors may generate weaning difficulties, resulting in longer duration of mechanical ventilation. In a large cohort of mechanically ventilated patients, VAT was significantly associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Beneficial effects of antimicrobial therapy were recently reported in VAT patients. In a randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial, aerosolized antibiotics significantly reduced the incidence of subsequent VAP. Further, aerosolized antibiotics increased weaning from mechanical ventilation, reduced usage of systemic antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. The impact of systemic antibiotics on outcomes of VAT patients was evaluated in a randomized unblinded controlled study. Antibiotic treatment increased mechanical ventilation free days, and reduced the incidence of subsequent VAP and ICU-mortality. Future studies should confirm these promising results, and determine the best duration of antimicrobial therapy in VAT patients.",

Both CMV and HSV are highly prevalent and ubiquitously distributed. In the immunocompetent adult host CMV and HSV infections usually have a benign course. As is the case with other herpesviruses, the initial infection is followed by a lifelong latent infection from which reactivation can occur. In immunocompetent individuals, asymptomatic viral shedding may be detectable in respiratory materials such as saliva or sputum in case of both HSV and CMV and also in urine in case of CMV. This viral shedding in patients without active viral disease makes it difficult to diagnose active disease in patients, especially since the symptoms of CMV and HSV infection (excluding typical skin lesions) are often non-specific. In immunocompromised patients CMV can lead to severe disease varying from retinitis and pneumonitis to generalized CMV disease. Occasionally, HSV may cause pneumonia as a result of immunosuppression, with a high mortality. However, critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are considered immunocompetent. Studies performed in ICU patients have shown these patients to be at risk for severe infections with CMV and HSV. In case of CMV, results from previously conducted studies point towards reactivation from latency as the most likely explanation rather than primary infection in ICU patients. Recent studies suggest that active CMV infection is quite common in ICU patients, with a prevalence up to 35%, depending on the sub-group of patients studied. Furthermore, an association between the presence of a CMV infection and increased mortality in critically ill patients was found. In recent years, the interest in HSV as a causative micro-organism in ICU patients has increased, especially as a cause of pulmonary infection. Recent reports detected HSV-1 in respiratory samples from ICU patients not considered to be primarily immunocompromised. In all studies a significant adverse effect of HSV-1 shedding in the respiratory tract on clinical outcome was established. Two studies showed an association between a high load of HSV present in the respiratory tract and increased mortality. At this moment it is not clear whether the association of both CMV and HSV with increased mortality is due to the micro-organism itself or that it is just an indication of the deteriorating physical condition of the patients leading to reactivation of the virus.",

Typhimurium showed significantly decreased overall survival in comparison to wild-type (median area under the curve (AUC) of 1.49\u00d710 6 versus 1.43\u00d710 5 , statistically significant at the 1% level). In most experiments, there was a log difference in bacterial concentration (cfu ml-1) between the wild-type and resistant strains at all timepoints. There was not a significant difference between the wild-type and reverted strains or between the reverted and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. To determine whether there was a difference in intracellular replication, data were analysed as a percentage of the bacterial concentration at t = 0 (that is, 90 minutes after infection). There was not a statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.96). Conclusions: Fluoroquinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium showed decreased survival in murine macrophages. Further work is needed to identify the genes responsible for this change, since the mutants were not isogenic. S18 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations O81 Binding and activation of plasminogen on Fusobacterium necrophorum P. Kuusela\u00b0, N. Friberg, H. Jarva, P. Mattila, R. Soliymani, M. Baumann (Helsinki, FI) Objective: Many bacteria have plasminogen (Plg) receptors (PlgR) on their surface. Binding to PlgRs enhances activation of the bound Plg to active enzyme plasmin and leads to protection of surface-associated plasmin against physiological plasmin inhibitors. Surface-associated plasmin is thought to play a pathogenetic role in various infections. In this work we have studied Plg binding and activation on Fusobacterium necrophorum (Fnec), an important Gram-negative rod-shaped anaerobe causing Lemierre's syndrome characterized by sepsis and internal jugular vein thrombosis preceded by an oropharyngeal infection. Methods: Plg binding was monitored by incubating bacteria isolated from clinical samples with I125 Plg alone or in various combinations with lysine analog epsilon-amino-caproic acid (EACA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and alfa2-antiplasmin (alfa2AP), the physiological plasmin inhibitor, followed by counting of the bound radioactivity or by analyzing the bound Plg with SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Plg activation was recorded by following the breakdown of the chromogenic substrate S-2251 in various reagent combinations. Tentative fusobacterial PlgRs were identified by means of ligand blotting of bacterial outer membrane proteins with Plg and by subsequent MALDI-Tof analysis. Results: Fnec (n = 11) bound significantly better iodinated Plg than F. nucleatum (n = 14). Binding was inhibited by EACA and lead to enhanced activation by tPA. Formed plasmin was protected against inhibition by alfa2AP. Additionally, SDS-PAGE analysis of the bound plasmin revealed trimming of the formed Glu-plasmin to a slightly shorter Lys-form of the enzyme. Ligand blotting/MALDI-Tof analyses revealed that acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was a predominant Plg binder among the fusobacterial outer membrane proteins.",

A random miniTn5 transposon mutagenesis created a library of randomly inserted knock out mutants in an AAHC patient isolate of K. oxytoca. The mutant library was screened for loss of cytotoxicity. The transposon insertion sites of toxin negative mutants were identified through isolation of adjacent chromosomal DNA via a plasposon rescue protocol followed by DNA sequencing. Finally, specific deletion mutants of the identified genes were generated and complementation of the cytotoxin negative phenotype was performed. Structure and regulation of cytotoxin production genes and the cytotoxin's chemical nature are under investigation. Cytotoxin positive and -negative K. oxytoca strains will be screened furthermore for distribution of those genes. Results: So far screening the mutant library revealed two toxin negative mutants. The insertion sites cluster in the same region, indicating an operon. Three functionally related putative genes could be identified: a non-ribosomal peptide synthase, a DAHP synthase and a Xaa proline amino peptidase. The genes are involved in the non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis and are not conserved in other Klebsiella species. Conclusion: The clustering of mutations leading to a cytotoxin negative phenotype suggests that the non-ribosomal biosynthesis pathway is essential for cytotoxin production. The substance family known to be synthesized through that pathway in other organisms includes numerous fungal and bacterial effector substances, including antibiotics, cytostatics and siderophores.",

Results: We observed significantly more KC and IL-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage of Lcn2\u2212/\u2212 mice 6 hours after infection. This resulted in significantly increased neutrophil influx after 6 hours leading to improved bacterial clearance after 48 hours.

Finally, Lcn2KO mice displayed a significant survival advantage over wild type animals. Conclusion: Lcn2 is detrimental during murine pneumococcal pneumonia.

In contrast, apoptosis identified by annexin-V staining was induced by bacteria (25\u00b16%) and to a lesser extent by GFD (16\u00b17%) and TNF-a (17\u00b13%). Vulnerability to apoptosis peaked at 7d when stem cells and immature neurons were specifically susceptible for caspase-3 dependent apoptosis induced by GFD 10\u00b111% and 17\u00b112% and by TNF-a 13\u00b117% and 28\u00b112% respectively ( Figure 1B) . Conclusions: In a novel in vitro system of hippocampal neuronal differentiation, GFD and TNF-a induced caspase dependent apoptosis while bacteria induced caspase independent apoptosis. Stem cells and immature neurons are specifically vulnerable to undergo apoptosis in paradigms of BM. These results suggest that hippocampal injury in BM includes apoptosis of stem cells. The compromised regenerative potential of the hippocampus may contribute to the persistence of neurological deficits after BM. Objective: Streptococcus suis type 2 is an important swine and human pathogen responsible for septicaemia and meningitis. We demonstrated that in the brain of infected mice with S. suis, microglia expressed increased levels of different pro-inflammatory genes. To expand our knowledge of the interactions between S. suis and microglia, we evaluated the signalling pathways underlying S. suis-induced proinflammatory events. Methods: Mouse microglia line BV-2 was infected with a virulent wild type (WT) strain of S. suis or a panel of mutants altered at the capsule (CPS-mutant) or cell wall levels. Phagocytosis was quantified by an antibiotic protection assay. Cell supernatants were used to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines by ELISA and nitric oxide (NO) by the Griess reaction. Analysis from cell lysates, to evaluate inflammationassociated intracellular signalization pathways, was carried out by western blot using specific antibodies against iNOS, p-PKC, p-Tyr and mitogen-activated proteine kinase (MAPK) members p-JNK, p-ERK 1/2 and p-p38. Specific inhibitors of MAPK were used to confirm their participation in cytokine production. The involvement of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB was monitored by EMSA. Results: Phagocytosis and cytokine studies showed that the CPS was the only relevant virulence factor modulating bacterial interactions with microglia. The CPS helped bacteria to resist phagocytosis and regulate the inflammatory response as it hides pro-inflammatory components from the bacterial cell wall. S. suis induced iNOS expression and further NO production from microglia. Cells infected with the CPS-mutant showed stronger phosphorylation profiles for PKC, Tyr and MAPK. Likewise, pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK abrogated TNF-a and MCP-1 production from infected cells. Finally, S. suis-induced NF-kB translocation was faster for cells stimulated with the CPS-mutant, suggesting that bacterial cell wall components are potent inducers of NF-kB. Conclusions: Our data help to better understand the mechanisms underlying S. suis induction of inflammation in the brain, that in time would be useful to design more efficient anti-inflammatory strategies for meningitis. 19/30 (63%) of the ASP were not limited to a specific clinical area of the hospital and could be considered \"hospitalwide\" programs. Most of these ASP (70%) have been working for more than 5 years. The most frequent principles of ABX stewardship implemented in these programs were: 1) ABX streamlining or de-escalation and 2) intravenous to P.O. switch, both present in 23/30 of the surveys followed by 3) monitoring of \"strategic\" ABX (22/30). 26/30 (86%) of respondents stated that any physician could initially prescribe all of the antimicrobials included in the formulary. The most frequently activity carried out in the setting of Spanish ASP was 1) ABX restriction 80% followed by 2) conferences (74%) and 3) therapeutic audit and feed-back TAFB (68%). Asked for the antimicrobials that should be closely monitored, carbapenems (26/39), linezolid (11/30) and fluoroquinolones (11/30). A majority of respondents (72%) was highly pleased with this task. The most efficacious activity in the setting were thought to be the TAFB (68% considered them highly efficacious) and automatic reminders of antimicrobial duration of therapy. Conclusions: A minority (41%) of the surveyed hospitals in Spain has an ongoing ASP and large geographical variations were observed. Few of the ASP (30%) have been implemented in the last 5 years. TAFB was perceived as the most useful intervention in the setting of ASP. Carbapenems, linezolid and fluoriquinolones were considered the ABX most suitable to be monitored. The interventional policy by an AMT, based on the development of agreed upon prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial regimens, regular educational activities and microbiological and pharmaceutical monitoring significantly improved not only the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescription in this high-risk setting, but also the economical costs of antimicrobial acquisition.",

Five months after AS restriction, the MRSA incidence significantly decreased from 3.4 to 1.4 cases. The final model explained 42% of the incidence of MRSA over time, showing, conversely, that an increase of 1 DDD/100 PD of antibiotics increased the incidence of MRSA isolates from current level, i.e. 0.043 for ceftriaxone (significant impact at lag 2 and 3), and 0.012 for levofloxacin, at the same time. Conclusion: This study shows that modelling antibiotic use can either drive a more appropriate empirical and targeted antimicrobial therapy, or inform policy makers about negative adverse effects of certain antibiotic agents on selection of MRSA, and may ultimately control and prevent the misuse of antimicrobials. Restriction of several broad-spectrum antimicrobials might positively impact on MRSA, even if case-mix and the huge inhomogeneity of patients in general ICU may negatively affect the overall fitness of the model.",

A temporal effect between resistance in community isolates and outpatient use of ciprofloxacin (immediate and time lag, 1 month) and moxifloxacine (time lag 4 months) was observed, explaining 52% of the variance over time. The incidence of cefepime resistance in E. coli, as surrogate marker for ESBL, was correlated to ciprofloxacin use in the inpatient (lag 1 month) and outpatient (lag 4 months) settings and to the use of ceftriaxone (lag 0 months), piperacillin / tazobactam (lag 3 months) and cefepime (3 months) in the hospital (R2, 51%).

Methods: The first isolate of all Gram-negative organisms recovered from blood cultures, sputum and urine of hospitalised adults, between January 2008 and August 2009, were included. The proportion of isolates reported susceptible, before and after the policy change, were compared by c 2 test; DDD before and after were compared using independent t-test. The association between DDD prescription and susceptibility was tested using Pearson correlation and linear regression. Results: Ciprofloxacin use decreased (p < 0.001) and aztreonam use increased (p = 0.03) following policy revision. There was no change in meropenem, ceftriaxone or pip-tazo use. In all, 5445 isolates were evaluated; the proportion susceptible to ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001), aztreonam (p < 0.001), and pip-tazo (p = 0.049) increased. A significant inverse linear association between ciprofloxacin use and susceptibility was detected (p < 0.001; correlation p < 0.001). Furthermore, pip-tazo, aztreonam and meropenem susceptibility were inversely correlated with ciprofloxacin use (univariate pip-tazo r = \u22120.39 p = 0.045; aztreonam r = \u22120.69 p < 0.001; meropenem r = \u22120.53 p = 0.008), with a linear relationship apparent (pip-tazo p = 0.089; aztreonam p = 0.001; meropenem p = 0.016). Surprisingly, there was a significant positive linear association between aztreonam use and susceptibility (r = 0.61 p = 0.004). Conclusions: These data suggest that an antibiotic policy revision, successfully reducing ciprofloxacin use, correlated with an increase in ciprofloxacin susceptibility among Gram-negative organisms. Furthermore, this was also associated with an increase in susceptibility to B-lactam antibiotics, in spite of increased use of aztreonam. Therefore, reducing quinolone exposure within a population appears to exert a favourable effect on both quinolone and B-lactam susceptibility of Gramnegative organisms. Conclusions: Implementation of a fluoroquinolone ban has proved challenging, but has rewarded with a reduction in cases of CDI and fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli. Such an intervention may be a useful adjunctive measure in the management of outbreaks of infection due to Clostridium difficile ribotype 027. Of concern, is the increased use of broad spectrum agents such as meropenem. Further effort is required to limit the use of such agents, particularly in the context of the recent emergence of carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae and the lack of new anti-Gram-negative agents. O94 Do published studies provide accurate estimates of the association between antibiotic exposure and acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria? M. A. Cataldo, G. De Angelis, M. Cipriani, R. Cauda, E. Tacconelli\u00b0( Rome, IT) Objectives: Antibiotic stewardship is usually included in a multifaceted approach to combat the spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) into the healthcare setting. Numerous papers have demonstrated that prior antimicrobial drug exposure is a strong risk factor for infection due to ARB. However, the association between antibiotic therapy and the acquisition of ARB is still unclear and it is often confounded by scarce data on antibiotic usage. Our objectives were to define major limits of the available evidence and to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Methods: Two meta-analyses were performed to determine whether antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for the isolation of ARB. Target bacteria were: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenems-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB). The I2 test was calculated to assess whether results varied no more than might have been expected by the play of chance. The subgroup analysis was performed by stratifying sampling frame for inclusion, definition of case subjects and controls, study design, geographic area of the study, presence of adjustment of covariates and length of time in which antibiotic exposure was detected. A significant heterogeneity was considered for I2 > 50%. Results: Seventy-eight studies (60 related to MRSA and 18 studies to CRAB) were considered eligible for inclusion. All studies were cohort, case-control or prevalence survey. Patients who had taken antibiotics had a risk increased by 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7\u22121.9) and by 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2\u22121.4) fold of acquiring MRSA and CRAB, respectively. Significantly heterogeneity was detected for study design, definition of controls, sampling frame for inclusion, endemic / epidemic setting, adjustment for covariates. A regression analysis revealed that the heterogeneity was linked to the length of time in which antibiotic exposure was detected before isolation, selection of the control group, and sampling frame for inclusion. Conclusions: Our analysis confirms that the quality of the evidence available on the association between antibiotic therapy and the acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is poor. Specific guidelines focused on methodological issues to address the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant infections are urgently needed.",

            "text": "Methods: Based on earlier observations, a questionnaire was constructed, modified to account for habit strength (2). After pilot testing, the survey was distributed among physicians in a major teaching hospital. Results: Out of 393 contacted physicians, 195 completed questionnaires were received (50.5% corrected response rate). Using multivariate analysis, habit strength (b = 0.186; P = 0.022) and PBC (b = 0.171; P = 0.036), were significant determinants for overall intention. A moderator effect of respondents' position (staff member vs. resident) was found with staff members' intention influenced by habit strength (b = 0.281; P = 0.038), and residents' intention by PBC (b = 0.220; P = 0.040) only. Other factors were not significant. Looking for specific issues, education on antibiotics and guidelines was rated unsatisfactory. Conclusions: These divergent origins stipulate different approaches for improvement. With staff members experiencing a high influence of previous routine and habits, preferred interventions for this group are education, focused on changes in prior antibiotic practice and their causes, and reminders. Residents' intention is guided mainly by external influences and the amount of self-confidence, making feedback, convenient guideline formats and thorough guideline familiarization more suitable. Reference(s) [1] Results: Out of the 19 potential participants, 14 (74%) responded. Four of the non-responders withdrew officially indicating 'panel used for research' (n = 1) and 'assay not offered' (n = 3). The majority of datasets were generated by PFGE (n = 11), with the remainder generated by AFLP (n = 2) and spa typing (n = 2). Seventy-three percent of participants typed all samples correctly, all with PFGE. Results obtained from spa-typing and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) were found to be less discriminative than those obtained with PFGE. Discussion: We present the first EQA programme for the genotyping of MRSA. PFGE was implemented by most of the participating laboratories. However, most protocols proved to be suboptimal, resulting in inferior resolution in the higher or lower fragment regions. This suggests that further assay optimisation is required. The lack of resolution was most evident with the closely related MRSA strains in the panel. Results generated using AFLP and spa-typing showed less discriminatory power compared to PFGE. Participants reported a range of criteria for determining genotype and subtype. (Figure 1 ), and thus allowed the rapid and accurate discrimination of the investigated serotypes. Conclusion: HRM analysis is a new single-step closed-tube screening method for fast mutation detection and can therefore be used to discriminate even genetically closely related samples. HRM analysis has the potential to complement the classical serotyping of Salmonella isolates due to its discriminatory power and simplicity.

As a consequence, primer and probes are designed to cover the most common SCCmec types encountered in clinical MRSA isolates. Considering the enormous diversity of SCCmec sequences, rational primer selection can only be a best compromise between the coverage of as many SCCmec variants as possible and loosing analytical sensitivity due to primer multiplexing problems. Therefore incusivity rates may differ among the various PCR assay concepts. Methods: Three commercial PCR tests targeting the SCCmec-orfX junction were evaluated for analytical sensitivity, time-to-result and for their performance to cover animal-associated MRSA strains of the clonal complex CC398 next to human epidemic MRSA strains. Results: With exception of MRSA strains harboring \"uncommon\" SCCmec elements, all of the investigated human epidemic and animalassociated MRSA strains were detected by the Roche LightCycler MRSA Advanced Test, but the latter strains presented with a different Tm-value in melting curve analysis. DNA sequencing revealed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the S. aureus orfX region characteristic for MRSA CC398 strains, which are obviously covered by the proprietary sensor hybridization probe of the assay. All MRSA strains covered by the LightCycler MRSA Advanced Test also tested positive in the BD GeneOhm MRSA and the Cepheid Xpert MRSA test, but either these real-time PCR tests had no option to perform Tm-analysis or viewing of melting curves. Conclusions: As a practical application of the newly identified SNPs, we present the use of this commercial real-time PCR test for the direct detection and simultaneous identification of animal-associated MRSA strains. All of the investigated MRSA CC398 strains harbored at least one of the novel SNPs in the SCCmec-orfX junction \u2212 represented by a characteristic Tm of 55.5\u00baC in subsequent melting curve analysis. Since such a Tm-shift was not observed with any non CC398 MRSA strains yet, it may serve as a molecular marker for the presence of MRSA CC 398.",

            "text": "Bacterial resistance to quinolones is related to decreased permeability, active efflux, drug modification, target modification or target protection. Recent studies indicate that certain genes (recA, recC, tolC, fis, ruvC, xseA, xseB) also contribute to the intrinsic resistance of E. coli to quinolones. Microbiological and clinical aspects of low level quinolone resistance have been more often studied in enterobacteria. In these organisms, a single gyrA mutation causes resistance to nalidixic acid and MICs of fluoroquinolones as low as 0.125-0.25 mcg/ml (still higher than MICs of <0.008-0.06 mcg/ml for wild-type isolates). This mechanism favours the appearance of additional mutations in gyrA or in other topoisomerase-encoding genes, finally resulting in high level resistance. Target protection by Qnr proteins (often encoded by plasmid genes), decreased permeability by porin modifications or active efflux of chromosomal (particularly RND transporters) of plasmid (QepA proteins, OqxAB) origin also determine low level quinolone resistance. The Aac(6 )-Ib-cr enzyme modifies quinolones with a piperazinyl substituent. Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest that these additional low-level mechanisms may also represent an initial step for acquisition of increased resistance. Low level resistance mechanisms may be difficult to detect because they translate into MICs below current EUCAST or CLSI breakpoints. Interestingly, plasmid-mediated mechanisms may not sufficiently compromise the activity of nalidixic acid, which results in decreased susceptibility or low-level fluoroquinolone resistance in the absence of nalidixic acid resistance, which is in contrast with the usual consequences of mutations in topoisomerase genes. As quinolone efficacy is related to Cmax/CMI and AUC /CMI parameters, small variations (of even only 2\u22124 dilutions) due to low-level resistance mechanisms may contribute to therapeutic failure. Animal models and clinical data suggest a poor outcome of patients with severe infections caused by Salmonella, Klebsiella (and presumably other enterobacteria) with low level fluoroquinolone resistance. Because of these reasons, it would be important to know actual MICs of quinolones for clinical isolates, and to obtain additional information on quinolone resistance mechanisms. This will allow a better knowledge of risk factors for acquiring low level resistant strains, and a better definition of the actual therapeutic relevance of these organisms.",

Vancomycin is currently a cornerstone in the treatment of bacteraemia and infectious endocarditis (IE) due to this pathogen, but evidence linking vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4\u22128mg/ml to a high failure rate of vancomycin has led to the susceptibility breakpoint being considered when the MIC is 2mg/ml. However, vancomycin treatment failure is not uncommon even when MRSA strains are fully susceptible (MIC 2mg/ml), and studies have described a reduction in vancomycin efficacy against MRSA strains with high MIC but within the susceptible range. The presentation will deal with the different methods for determining the vancomycin MIC and discuss the implications of understanding the relationship between vancomycin MIC and vancomycin efficacy. (6 )-Ib-cr genes were found in 26% and 8% isolates, respectively. Qnr was mostly present in Klebsiella pneumoniae, while aac(6 )-Ib-cr was found exclusively in Escherichia coli. QepA was not found. Both genes were localized on plasmids and could be both transformed and trans-conjugated in acceptor strains. MIC of fluoroquinolones on these acceptor strains indicated a 20-100 increased resistance due to the plasmid-mediated mechanism. However, high-level resistance to fluoroquinolone in the wild-type strains was due to the additional presence of topoisomerase mutations in strains presenting both ESBL and PMQR. AmpC were detected on 5.5% isolates of Enterobacter spp. and Proteus mirabilis. Carbapenemases were found in 3% isolates of E. aerogenes, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Carbapenemases were subsequently genotypically characterized as IMP, VIM, OXA, KPC CMY or SME types. Conclusions: Emerging resistance mechanisms were found in ESBLproducing strains, with PMQR being the most frequent. While genotypic assays implement phenotypic testing of AmpC and carbapenemases, they are the only methods available up to date for detection of PMQR. Hence, both phenotypic and genotypic methods should be employed to rationally direct the pharmacological treatment. were screened by specific PCRs and sequencing analysis. M13 fingerprint typing method was used to compare this isolate with others K. pneumoniae isolates found in this hospital. Results: K. pneumoniae 2564FF was isolated from a blood culture of a patient with leukemia at Santa Maria Hospital, Lisbon. The MIC for imipenem, aztreonam and to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was 32 mg/L. The resistant phenotype was unchanged by EDTA but the inhibition zones for imipenem, aztreonam and to extended-spectrum cephalosporins were increased with boronic acid. K. pneumoniae 2564FF produced a restrict b-lactamase SHV-1 and the carbapenemase KPC-3. The blaKPC-3 gene is part of a plasmid and no amplification was observed after PCR for detection of transposase, resolvase, and putative insertion sequences (IS) elements located upstream of blaKPC gene, suggesting that the blaKPC gene in K. pneumoniae 2564FF was included in a different genetic environment like Tn4401. M13 fingerprinting analysis revealed that this genotype had not been detected in the hospital previously. Also the sequence type ST11 was not detected in others K. pneumoniae KPC-producing strains described worldwide. Conclusions: This is the first report of K. pneumoniae KPC-3 clinical isolate in Portugal. Our findings should alert medical authorities to implement stringent methods for the detection and spread control of emerging KPC carbapenemases.

Charbonnier, M. Gras, L.A. Ligeon, N. Guichard, N. Girard, R. Quentin the RHC Study Group (Tours, FR) Objectives: Epidemiological study involving the teaching hospital, 20 general hospitals, 7 local hospitals, 16 private clinics, 12 rehabilitationcare centers, 5 psychiatric clinics, 30 nursing homes (NHs) and 19 in town-clinical laboratories (for outpatients), to document the diffusion of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) into the region (2.8 millions unhabitants). Methods: During 15 days, all MRB isolated from diagnostic clinical samples were documented and strains were centralized. After identification control, antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed (standard procedures). Genetic diversity of strains was studied (PFGE). 56% from urine (1.5% of urine samples), 23% from superficial pus (0.6% of pus), 9% from respiratory tract (5% of respiratory tract samples), 5% from deep pus, 4% from blood and one from intravenous devices. MRB belonged to 14 species. S. aureus (36%) and E. coli (31%) predominated, followed by E. cloacae (9%), P. aeruginosa (8%), K. pneumoniae (5%) and A. baumannii (2%). Vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecium were not recovered. Diversity was the highest in healthcare institutions (HCIs). By contrast, S. aureus predominated in NHs, E. coli among outpatients. 70% of MRSA strains were nonmultiresistant (usually named CA-MRSA). 79% of ESBL-producing E. coli strains were CTX-M. MRSA and ESBL-producing E. coli strains were (1) mostly resistant to fluoroquinolones (93 and 60% respectively), (2) genetically diverse and distinct from clones classically spreading into HCIs, (3) widely spread in HCIs, NHs and outpatients, (4) responsible for rare outbreaks, but in NHs. E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and A. baumannii were the most involved in outbreaks into HCIs, and were associated with a lower genetic diversity. Conclusion: MRD are unfrequent, but their diffusion is large, especially for recent MRSA and ESBL-producing E. coli clones. Prevalence is the highest into HCIs, but MDR diffuse now out of HCIs, and especially in NHs. We suggest that an effective alert system to detect emerging and/or epidemic phenomenon should involve MDR survey in HCIs, NHs and in town-clinical laboratories. Objective: To examine differences in antibiotic susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria and in antibiotic consumption in a Tertiary Hospital, within 7 years of operation. Methods: All clinical samples from inpatients. Identification and susceptibility testing, using the Wider \u00ae semi-automated system with CLSI breakpoints. Antibiotic consumption expressed as Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per patient-day. Objective: Metallo-b-lactamases are powerful resistance mechanisms that can generate insensitivity to virtually all b-lactam antibiotics.",

Plasmid analysis on A subset of transconjugants (20) was performed by replicant typing and S1 PFGE and subsequent probing. A/C plasmid analysis was further performed using a set of 12 primers designed to amplify sections of the backbone of A/C plasmids and DNA probing with A/C probes. Results: All isolates from the North of India were Klebsiella pneumoniae and carried A/C plasmids of size 50kb (9), 80\u221290kb (2), or 118kb (11). However, in the south of India isolates were of various enteric species and gave numerous different pulsed field gel restriction types. Furthermore plasmids found in the isolates from the south were of many different sizes ranging from 100kb to 375kb in size. Probing indicated that most plasmids carrying blaNDM-1 were of rep A/C type (19/20) only 1/20 tested were found to be carried on the F plasmid. Transconjugants were selected for all strains except the small plasmids from the North of India. Transconjugants gave plasmids of mostly the same size but examples were found of size changes following transconjugation including both increasing and decreasing size. PCR on transconjugants and parents indicated differences in the A/C plasmid backbone. Conclusions: blaNDM-1 emergence in enteric organisms in India is linked mostly to A/C plasmid types of varying sizes ranging from 50kb to 375kb.",

            "text": "Objective: E. coli is the most frequent cause of bacteraemia in the UK, and increasing antimicrobial resistance could severely compromise current therapeutic approaches. Objective: Atypical Mycobacteria can cause disease in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals. They can rarely cause disseminated infections. Nevertheless infections in immunocompromised patients by atypical mycobacteria are described. Results: We report a case of a 54-year-old man with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) stadium III E B of the stomach, proximal duodenum, axillary, inguinal and cervical lymph nodes after six cycles R-CHOP 14 and one cycle R-DHAP chemotherapy received via central venous catheter (CVC) who develops leucopenia and anemia. Blood culture reveals Mycobacterium fortuitum. On admission to our hospital several days later a blood sample reveals leucocytosis (10.97\u00d710 9 cells/litre), low hemoglobin level (9.8 g/dl) and thrombocytosis (517\u00d710 9 platelets/litre). The C-reactive protein level was 43.9 mg/l. The patient has no fever. Blood cultures taken simultaneously peripherally and via CVC reveal both Mycobacterium conceptionense (Mycobacterium fortuitum group). The CVC is removed, but routine culture is negative for Mycobacteria. Because of a sustained bacteraemia for more than ten days and an underlying immunocompromission antibiotic treatment with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) and amikacin (15 mg/kg once daily) is done for two weeks in accordance with the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS). A repeat blood culture after therapy is sterile. Conclusion: In literature there are only few descriptions of invasive infections with rapidly growing Mycobacterium fortuitum. In a setting of underlying immunocompromised disease we treat bloodstream infection, advocate a duration of two weeks after having removed the catheter and review literature for the necessity for antibiotic treatment. \u2022 To assess underlying risk factors for infection \u2022 To assess treatment given, incidence of side effects, treatment cure and relapse rates Methods: In this retrospective study 2000-2007, we examined pulmonary NTM infections south London hospital. Cases were identified through the microbiological database and case notes records. Inclusion criteria were: culture positivity for Mycobacterium kansasii (MK), Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI), Mycobacterium xenopi (MX) and Mycobacterium malmoense (MM); >18 years old; HIV negative; meeting the ATS (American Thoracic Society) clinical criteria. Radiological reports were made by a radiologist. Statistical analyses were made on SPSS v15, using t tests and Mann Whitney U as appropriate. Results: Of 211 patients identified with NTM isolates, 57 met inclusion criteria. Males (76%) with a median age of 60.5 years predominated. Predisposing factors were smoking (76.1%), alcohol (30.4%) and COPD (39.1%). Radiologically, cavitation (63.6%) and pulmonary infiltrates (31.8%) were common findings. 47 patients were treated, 10 not treated and 5 died. The predominant organism was MK, 35 of 47 cases (74.5%). Of the MK infections, there was a 100% cure rate with a 10% relapse rate over a 3 year follow up period. Treatment courses differed from British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, most patients receiving triple therapy of rifampicin, ethambutol and usually clarithromycin or ciprofloxacin for >9 months. Side effects were common, occurring in 30% of treated infections. The statistically significant predictors of a poor outcome were a low pre-treatment weight and absence of fever. Conclusions: M. kansasii is the predominant NTM organism in London. Optimal treatment regimens are unclear. In this study many patients were treated with 3 agents, in counterpoint to BTS guidelines. However, adding a third agent to the treatment regimen for MK did not appear to reduce the relapse rate, but did increase the risk of side effects. Objective: Between May and September 2009 9 patients were referred to our infectious diseases outpatient clinic because of skin lesions and suppurative lymphadenitis after permanent make-up of the eyebrows. We present the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the patients and the results of the outbreak investigation. Methods: All but one patients had at least a lymph node fine needle aspiration, whereas skin biopsy of the eyebrow was performed only in 4 cases. Microscopic examination for mycobacteria, culture and broadrange mycobacterial PCR (16 S rRNA) were performed. Diagnosis of the first case was established using broad-range mycobacterium PCR. As PCR was positive for M. haemophilum, special culture was performed. After notification to the public health authorities, an investigation was started and all possibly contaminated material was examined for mycobacteria. Results: All patients presented with an inflammatory lesion of the eyebrow associated with ipsilateral lymphadenitis located within the parotid gland. The lesions appeared 2\u22126 weeks after permanent makeup of the eyebrows. Fine needle aspiration and skin biopsy of the eyebrow were positive for mycobacteria in 8 and 1 case, respectively. Microscopic examination showed acid-fast bacilli in 6 cases whereas broad-range PCR was positive for M. haemophilum in 5 cases. Culture was positive for 7 patients after 14-70 days (median 44 days) and the microorganism was identified as M. haemophilum. All patients were treated with various combinations of ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and either rifampin or rifabutin. Parotidectomy, local eyebrow excision and partial neck dissection were performed in 3 cases. Three patients were in complete remission following surgical intervention, one patient was in partial remission after two months of conservative treatment. The remaining 5 patients were stable after 2\u22126 weeks of antibiotic therapy (still ongoing). Outbreak investigation showed that all makeup procedures were performed by the same tattoo artist. PCR of the the make-up ink was positive in 6 out of 19 samples for M. haemophilum, cultures are still negative after 5 weeks.",

PCR analysis of mycobacterial 16S rRNA is an effective tool for early diagnosis and for appropriate selection of culture method. Optimal management of the infection requires further studies. Protection studies on immune mice intraperitoneally infected with GBS. Results: All DNA samples from 85 GBS strains tested by PCR and hybridization were found to carry cspA gene. Two portions of scpB and two portions of cspA (pB1, pB3 and csp2, csp3) encoding for a helical regions of C5a-ase and CspA were amplified and cloned. Resultant proteins PB1, PB3 and CSP2, CSP3 (M.M. 12 kDa, 10 kDa and 42 kDa, 12 kDa, respectively) were successfully expressed in E. coli followed by purification with Ni sepharose. All polypeptides under study generated humoral immune response in mice and rabbits. The antisera were examined for their opsonizing ability against GBS strains of six different serotypes employing mouse peritoneal macrophages. The data demonstrated significant opsonizing effect of anti-PB1, anti-PB3, anti-CSP3 immune sera over the control. Mice preliminary immunized with the polypeptides were studied for development of GBS infection. As result obvious GBS clearance from the spleens of mice immunized with PB1, PB3 and CSP3 in comparison with control group was determined. In contrast anti-CSP2 antibodies were found to possess neither opsonizing ability nor protective activity in above mentioned experiments. Conclusion: 1. DNA from 85 GBS strains comprised cspA gene. 2. PB1, PB3 and CSP3 with high a helix structure displayed the immunogenic and protective properties that allowed proposing them as vaccine components against GBS.",

They lead to significant mortality and morbidity in humans as well as live-stock and are a big burden for healthcare providers. With fast rising antibiotic resistance rates among clinical ExPEC isolates preventive vaccination against these pathogenic E. coli is greatly desired. Methods: Based on genome analysis data and in vivo transcription studies we selectively target virulence factors expressed during the course of infection such as iron acquisition systems. Immunogenic regions as well as the unknown three dimensional structure of these proteins were analyzed in silico. MHCI and MHCII epitopes as well as proteasome cleveage sites were also taken into account. Based on this data two synthetic modular vaccine proteins were designed each bearing eight epitope rich subfragments. For each a fully synthetic gene was constructed and optimized regarding sequence and codon bias. We used and evaluated two application routes in the mouse model. First we used purified vaccine proteins for intranasal application. Second we used a novel Salmonella based bacterial antigen delivery system which is simply administered orally. As it translocates the vaccine directly into the cytoplasm of immune cells in vivo, T-cellular response is greatly enhanced. Results: Specific immune responses were evaluated with IFN-g ELISpot, flow cytometry and sub-class sensitive antibody ELISA. Intranasally immunized mice demonstrated massive increases of specific serum IgG as well as vaginal fluid IgA antibodies against the recombinant vaccine protein as well as against purified full length virulence factors of ExPEC. Expansion of vaccine specific IFN-g secreting T-cells could be proven in both immunization routes. In the challenge model of peritonitis a significant reduction of bacterial load could be achieved in immunized mice, demonstrating the first successful combined T-cell vaccine against ExPEC in the mouse model.",

            "text": "Combined T-cell and antibody stimulating vaccines containing multiple epitopes are effective against ExPEC in the mouse. Further evaluation is needed to elucidate the potential for use in humans. Since 1990s, vaccination strategies against toxoplasmosis mainly used DNA vaccine, purified recombinant proteins showed variable protection because vaccine candidate antigens were almost always selected randomly and targeted tachyzoite form which invades the host cell abruptly and immediately embeds itself in a protective parasitophorous vacuole which keeps away the host immune response. Currently, there is substantial evidence about T. gondii oocysts (contains sporozoites) as being the cause of water related outbreaks. After classification of T. gondii oocysts in category B bioterrorism agents as a water safety threat, the demand for a protective vaccine against toxoplasmosis has increased. The present study aims to generate first time a DNA vaccine containing a sporozoite specific surface antigen \"SporoSAG\" to block the sporozoites as they are released from the oocysts in the intestine. To increase the efficacy of the vaccine, antigen specific-CD8 response inducing antiapoptotic Bcl-xL gene was inserted to the dual expression DNA vaccine. Methods: During the construction of the dual expression DNA vaccine, SporoSAG was inserted after CMV promoter and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL were inserted in frame with EGFP after IRES (pIRES2EGFP-SporoSAG-Bcl-xL). In vitro transfection of BHK-21 cells was performed to show the expression of SporoSAG and Bcl-xL. The functionality of Bcl-xL was demonstrated by Casp3 flow cytometry. Humoral and cellular immune response (CD4/CD8, IFN-g) were analyzed from sera and spleen cells of vaccinated BALB/c mice by western blot and flow cytometry using purified recombinant SporoSAG protein ( Figure 1 ).",

O152 Assessment of a new DNA vaccine candidate against urinary tract infection J. Fallah Mehrabadi\u00b0, M. Hoseini Moghaddam, S. Najafi, N. Khoramabadi, M. Mahdavi (Tehran, Zanjan, IR) Objective: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common infectious diseases and the major agent of UTI is Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Most of the time, it has affinity to attached to the vaginal and urinary tract mucosa tissue. UPEC has intracellular propagation, when do invasion of bladder epithelial cells. Therefore, cellular immune response is so important in this case. In our research, a genetic construct for inducing of cellular immune system was designed and immune response of immunized mice was evaluated. Materials and Methods: Chromosomal DNA extracted from E. coli 35218 as a positive type I pili strain and fimH gene amplified by using this template in PCR. The PCR product inserted to pBluescript cloning vector and sequenced. Then, the fimH gene sub cloned to pVax eukaryotic expression vector. The recombinant vector sequenced again. COS7 cell line transfected with a complex of pVax/fimH and ExGen 500 poly cationic polymer. Three groups of BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant DNA construct. The first group injected intramuscularly (i.m) with two doses (100 mg for every injection during two weeks) of purified pVax/fimH. The second group injected with the same amount of pVax vector and the third group injected with PBS as negative control. All mice challenged, one week following the second injection, with uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 35218. Moreover, lymphocytes isolated from spleen of immunized mice and cultured for cytokines assay. Results: The sequence of E. coli 35218 fimH gene in our research showed more than 97% identity to other fimH sequence reports in GenBank. Expression of fimH gene in transfected COS7 was confirmed by RT-PCR. The result of challenge showed 100 times reduction of E. coli colonization in bladder tissue of first group mice. Additionally, IFN-g titer got rise in first group on compression with others groups. Discussion: fimH gene has a little variation among type I pili positive strains but it has less variation on amino acid sequences. Hence, it was detected more than 97% identity of E. coli 35218 fimH sequence with others. Expression of fimH in pVax/fimH cassette was confirmed by RT-PCR. Consequently, induction of cellular immune response was showed by increasing of INF-g titration in immunized mice. So, DNA vaccination has a potential candidate for limiting recurrent urinary tract infection.",

Khawplod, U. Thisyakorn, V. Sitprija (Bangkok, TH) HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ T lymphocyte had a poor Nab response to conventional pre-and post-exposure rabies vaccination. Our previous reports revealed that HIV-infected patients with CD4+ counts <200 /mL did not respond well to conventional intramuscular (IM) post-exposure vaccination or multiple-site intradermal (ID) vaccination. We conducted a prospective study of the Nab response after doubling the IM doses of WHO IM regimen (ESSEN) and aluminium-adjuvanted tetanus toxoid (TT) in AIDS persons. Fifteen AIDS patients (age range, 30\u221246 years) without active opportunistic infections who presented with possible or proven rabies exposure were enrolled. Four patients had severe exposure (WHO category III). All patients had a history of AIDSrelated conditions such as opportunistic infections or CD4+ counts <200 /mL, Only 5 patients did not received antiretroviral therapy. All patients were given the post-exposure rabies prophylaxis. They received doubling the doses of IM regimen (2\u22122-2\u22122-2\u22120) with purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (doubling the IM doses of vaccine in 1\u22121-1\u22121-1\u22120 ESSEN-IM regimen) but one of the two rabies vaccines on day 0 was dissolved in 0.5-mL dose of aluminium-adjuvanted TT. Blood samples were obtained on days 0, 7, 14, 28, 90, 180 and 360 after vaccination for rabies Nab. CD4+ counts were determined from all patients before vaccination. Blood was drawn for determination of HIV-RNA level on days 0, 28, and 90 after vaccination. There was no serious adverse reaction among all patients treated. No death as a result of rabies during the next 1 year was reported. Seven AIDS patients with CD4+ counts <100/mL (range, 1\u221299 /mL) had a poor or even undetectable Nab response. Eight AIDS patients with higher CD4+ counts (>250 / mL) had good Nab responses as our previous studies. We also observed that HIV-RNA level did not increase significantly after rabies vaccination. Conclusion: At present, cleansing the wound, vigorous wound injection with immunoglobulin, and determination of Nab response in AIDS patients who had very low CD 4 + T lymphocyte count after postexposure rabies vaccination are the most important post-exposure measures that can be offered to AIDS and moderately or severely rabiesexposed patients. Patients were further stratified to 4 groups according to CD4+ count when primary PCV was administered: group 1, CD4+ <200 cells/mL; group 2, CD4+, 200 to 349 cells/mL; group 3, CD4+, 350 to 499 cells/mL; and group 4, CD4+ 500 cells/mL. All patients were given 1-week diary to record any discomfort after vaccination. All statistical analyses are performed by STATA statistical software. Results: 407 HIV-infected patients were vaccinated with PCV during the study period: 206 patients received two doses and 201 patients one dose. After first dose vaccination, 372 (91.1%) patients who returned their oneweek diary for recording side effects were assessed. Among these 372 HIV-infected patients, 124 (33.3%) patients reported discomfort after the vaccination that included injection site soreness (22.85%), pain (8.60%), redness (1.08%), swelling (1.62%), fever (1.62%), headache (1.88%), fatigue (4.30%), cough (1.34%), rash (0.53%), rhinorrhea (0.27%), sneezing (0.27%), and insomnia (0.27%). None of these patients reported severe adverse events that prompted medical attention. The only factor that was found to be associated with occurrence of side effects was high nadir CD4 counts (P = 0.04) before vaccination. The associated factors for injection site soreness, the most common side effect after vaccination, included high nadir CD4 counts (P = 0.01) before vaccination and high HIV viral load at vaccination (P = 0.01). None of the patients who received two doses PCV reported aggravated discomfort after second dose vaccination. Conclusions: We conclude that vaccination with 7-valent PCV among HIV-infected patients was generally safe and high nadir CD4 counts before vaccination were associated with increased risk for injection side reactions.

Methods: Two pilus-like structures (PI-1 and PI-2) have been recently recognized in pneumococci. These have been implicated in virulence and suggested as potential vaccine targets. However these pilus-like structures are not universally distributed among pneumococcal strains. We had previously demonstrated that carrying PI-1 was a clonal property of S. pneumoniae and that only 27% of the invasive strains carried the rlrA islet. Furthermore, 83% of these piliated strains expressed vaccine serotypes. Similar findings were reported for the PI-2 islet which was shown to be present in 16% of a convenience sample of strains. PI-2 positive clonal complexes were associated with serotypes 1, 2, 7F, 19A, and 19F. The introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) resulted in changes in serotype frequency that can also affect pili prevalence. To evaluate this effect we determined the presence of PI-1 and PI-2 among a collection of 475 invasive isolates recovered from children after PCV7 introduction (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) . The results were analyzed in terms of pilus islet association with antibiotic resistance, serotype, pulsed-field gel electrophoretic profile (PFGE) and multilocus sequence type. Results: Overall, 46.7% of the strains presented one of the pilus islet.",

PI-2 islet was found to be present in 37% of the pneumococcal strains and was identified mainly among serotypes 1 and 7F. Conclusion: A decrease in the presence of the rlrA islet among invasive pneumococcal strains was observed after PCV7 availability. This change is associated with the decrease of vaccine serotypes since the majority of the strains carrying PI-1 expressed vaccine serotypes. In contrast, PI-2 islet was more prevalent due to the predominance of serotypes 1 and 7F. Since most of the strains carrying pili presented serotypes that are included either in current or future conjugate vaccine formulations, their potential use in a vaccine would offer limited additional benefits.

            "text": "We organised a network of 106 laboratories capable of isolating C. difficile strains in 34 European countries. In November 2008, 1\u22127 hospitals per country, depending on population size, tested stool samples of patients aged >2 years who were suspected of CDI, or who had developed diarrhoea after 3 days of hospital admission. CDI was defined by a positive enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile toxin A and/or B, a positive cytotoxicity test, or positive culture of a toxigenic strain. Each hospital collected detailed clinical data of the first 10 CDI cases, and sent stool isolates of C. difficile for PCR-ribotyping and characterization of toxin A, toxin B and binary toxin genes. After 3 months, follow-up clinical data were collected. Results: CDI incidence varied across hospitals (mean: 5.5 per 10,000 patient-days per hospital; range: 0 to 36.3). Detailed information was obtained on 509 patients and 395 isolates of these patients were available for characterization. Sixty-two different PCR ribotypes were found, among which 014 (15%), 001 (10%) and 078 (8%) were most prevalent. The prevalence of PCR ribotype 027 was 5%. Most patients had the previously identified risk profile of an elderly patient with co-morbidity and recent antibiotic use. At follow-up, 22% of patients had died and in 40% of these deaths CDI played a role. In multivariate analysis, age 65 yrs, use of macrolides and infection by PCR ribotypes 015, 018 and 056 were significantly associated with death to which CDI contributed. Ceftazidime use and having recurrent CDI at inclusion were significantly associated with recurrences during follow-up. Conclusion: In this pan-European, hospital-based study, the incidence of healthcare-associated CDI varied widely between hospitals. The overall and attributable mortality were high. Dominant PCR ribotypes were 014, 001 and 078, whereas 015, 018 and 056 were associated with a complicated disease course. These data emphasise the importance of multi-country surveillance and indeed that PCR ribotypes other than 027 are prevalent causes of CDI in Europe. In AC, 1,045 CDI-patients were reported; CDI incidence was 2.18 cases per 10,000 pd (1.05 case per 1,000 admissions). By origin, 686 (66%) cases were healthcare-associated (HA), 598 (87%) of which were acquired in the reporting HCF; 294 (28%) community-associated (CA); 65 (6%) of unknown origin (UO). Among 734 CDI-patients diagnosed in HCF actively following them up for a month, 100 (14%) were severe cases and 25 (3%) died from their CDI. In RLTC, 251 CDI-patients were reported; CDI incidence was 1.31 cases per 10,000 pd. By origin, 231 (92%) cases were HA, 204 (88%) of which were acquired in the reporting HCF; 8 (3%) CA; 12 (5%) of UO. Among 186 CDI-patients diagnosed in HCF actively following them up for a month, 4 (2%) were severe cases and died from their CDI. Last, 237 C. difficile strains were sent by 54 HCF to the NRC; their characterisation and typing are underway. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this survey confirm that CDI incidence in France is much lower than reported in other European countries, and suggest that CDI are adequately controlled in French HCF. However, the high proportion of CA cases reported in AC wards suggests the need for further studies. Final results from this survey will be presented in April.",

Conclusion: Although public health relevance of Clostridium difficile contaminated food is yet to be clarified, these preliminary results prompt to consider that ground beef and pork do not represent a risk factor for human infection in North-East of Italy. Our findings are supported by those of Von Abercron (2009), who found a low prevalence (2%) of Clostridium difficile contaminated ground meet in Sweden.

These apparently conflicting results may be due to different prevalence of Clostridium difficile at fatted calf and swine primary production or to different hygiene both at slaughterhouse and at retail outlets. The hypothesis should be further investigated. In the overall logistic regression model, length of stay, transfer from another NHS hospital, number of different antibiotics, number of days of quinolone antibiotics, degree of comorbidity and number of days of nitroimidazole antibiotics were identified as risk factors (see figure) .

Therefore, studies on the correlation between the incidence of C. difficile and antibiotic consumption were limited to toxic strains in the past. The aim of this ecological study was to analyse the association between unit-specific antibiotic consumption and the incidence of toxigenic and non-toxigenic C. difficile in hospitalised patients. Methods: Unit specific antibiotic consumption data and the incidence of C. difficile in 19 units over 5 years were analysed at the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. Stool samples were tested for toxin A/B and simultaneously cultured. In a second step, positive cultures were tested for toxin production. In order to analyse specific antibiotics, unit specific length of stay and antibiotics showing a significant association in univariate analysis were entered in a multiple linear regression model. Results: Over 5 years, a total of 165 first isolates of toxin producing C. difficile and 413 first isolates of C. difficile were detected. The incidence of C. difficile overall and of toxin producing C. difficile was 0.39 and 0.15 per 1000 patient days, respectively. The correlation (figure) is highly significant in both analyses (p < 0.001), but a higher correlation results when all C. difficile strains are included in the model (R = 0.80 vs. R = 0.63). In a multivariate analysis explaining more than 80% of the variance of the incidence of C. difficile (R2=0.82), only piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and the aminoglycosides were found to be statistical significant risk factors.",

Overall antibiotic pressure as a risk factor was previously underestimated due to restriction to the toxin producing strains. Our results underline the importance of the overall pressure of antibiotics that explains the majority of the variance rather than the importance of a single group of antimicrobial agents such as quinolones. Therefore, interventions to reduce the overall antibiotic consumption might be more successful in controlling C. difficile incidence than interventions focusing on certain groups of antibiotics. Figure. Correlation between unit-specific antibiotic consumption and incidence of C. difficile. Conclusions: Impaired immune function, a high comorbidity burden, advanced age, and the presence of other infections were seen as risk factors for HO-HCFA CDI. Antibiotic therapy has been known to play a central role in the pathogenesis of CDI but the observation of tigecycline exposure's protective effect is unexpected. Additional research is needed to better understand the differential risks and benefits of various broad spectrum antibiotics among patients at risk for HO-HCFA CDI. . In a multivariate analysis after adjustment for age, sex and geographical region, the relative risk was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0\u22122.4). Conclusion: An identical mortality was seen for patients with CD strains possessing the binary toxin \u2212 irrespective of the PCR ribotype (CD027 or CD non-027). The mortality for patients with CD A and B strains was significantly lower than among patients with CD027 and CD non-027 but higher than among unselected patients. The results suggest that the binary toxin either is a marker for more virulent CD strains or contributes directly to the virulence of these strains. Furthermore, the data confirms that criteria used in the Danish CD surveillance programme ensure molecular characterisation (genotypic toxin profiling and PCR ribotyping) of the most virulent strains enabling detection of emerging hyper virulent strains.",

We studied the prevalence of C. diff carriage, selection for C. diff and development of C. diff infection (CDI) in patients (pts) hospitalized and treated for LRTI and compared the different treatment regimes. Methods: Pts receiving antibiotic treatment for LRTI in one university medical center and an affiliated teaching hospital were prospectively followed for 30 days with careful monitoring of the development of diarrhoea. Of all patients, stool samples collected on admission, day 5, day 3 after discontinuation of antibiotics and day 30 were cultured for C. diff using selective plates. Cultured isolates were further characterized for toxin production and typed by PCR ribotyping. CDI was defined as the presence of diarrhoea and a positive faeces toxin test. Results: Of 107 pts included, 45 (41.1%) pts were treated with moxifloxacin, 47 (43.9%) with b-lactam monotherapy and 15 (14.0%) with b-lactam/macrolide combination therapy. The endemic rate of CDI in the participating hospitals is 0.6/1000 pts a year. In total, during the study period, C. diff was cultured in 18.7% (n = 20) of pts. 6 (30%) isolates were toxin positive. On admission, baseline prevalence of C. diff carriage was 10.4% (n = 10). Of those, one patient had mild CDI and persistent positive cultures for C. diff during the study period. The overall acquisition rate of C. diff carriage after antibiotic treatment for LRTI in our population was 10.3% (n = 11). Acquisition rates of C. diff carriership were 11.1% (n = 5) in moxifloxacin, 10.6% (n = 5) in b-lactam and 6.7% (n = 1) in b-lactam/macrolide treated pts (p = NS). Tests for faeces toxin production were negative in all pts who acquired C. diff. No acquired CDI or relapse of previous CDI occurred during the study period. Risk factors for C. diff carriership at any time were intravenous antibiotic treatment >7 days (OR 3.89, 95% CI 1.3-11.8) and hospitalization the past 3 months (OR 4.08, 95% CI 1.4-11.9). Conclusions: In a setting with a low endemic rate, acquisition rates for C. diff during antibiotic treatment for LRTI were 10% and did not lead to CDI. Moxifloxacin was not associated with increased acquisition rates for C. diff as compared to other antibiotics classes prescribed for LRTI.",

In such cases, antibiotics could decrease the duration of the disease, enable a faster recovery and shorten the carrier state. Azithromycin proved effective in the treatment of acute infectious gastroenterocolitis. Two studies involving US military personnel in Thailand indicated that a single azithromycin dose (1 g) or a 3-day regimen (500 mg/day) were comparable or superior to ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin in empirical treatment of acute diarrhea.

Worldwide, b-lactamase production accounts for the majority of H. influenzae ampicillin resistance. Mutations in penicillin-binding proteins are another b-lactam resistance mechanism. These H. influenzae strains are called b-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant or BLNAR. BLNAR strains are less susceptible to ampicillin but also to amoxyclavulanate and to second-or third-generation cephalosporins. BLNAR strains were, until now, rare and increases in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were limited, making use of aminopenicillins in high doses still warranted. This situation is changing. Most notably, for example, BLNAR strains have increased significantly in Japan. Similarly, in some European countries (Spain and France), an increasing prevalence of BLNAR is also seen. Some of these strains have increased MIC values that make treatment with aminopenicillins or second-or third-generation cephalosporins ineffective. A further increase of BLNAR strains might challenge our current guidelines for treatment of RTI that advocate use of amoxy-clavulanate or second-generation cephalosporins as first-line treatment options.

A total of 10,081 H. influenzae infections were reported between 2000 and 2006;2 of these, 2836 (28%) were due to Hib and 4466 (44%) to non-typeable H. Influenza (NTHi). It was found that the incidence of NTHi was almost twice that of Hib (0.28 versus 0.15 per 100,000 cases) and that both Hib and NTHi infections were more common in infants and the elderly. Moreover, the incidence of NTHi was much higher than Hib in the first month of life (11.4 versus 1.2 per 100,000 cases) and infections were more likely to occur in the first week of life, suggesting vertically acquired infection. Overall, however, the median age at disease was higher for NTHi infections than for Hib (58 years versus 5 years, p < 0.0001). NTHi infections were also associated with: a higher case fatality ratio (CFR; 366/3172 [11.5%] versus 88/2005 [4.4%]; p < 0.0001), particularly among infants (17.4% versus 2.9%; p < 0.0001); and a higher proportion of NTHi infections among women of child-bearing age. In addition, one-third of reported meningitis cases were due to NTHi. The CFRs for Hib and NTHi meningitis were similar in EU-IBIS data (4.1% versus 4.2%) but in England and Wales, the CFR was much higher for NTHi meningitis (17% versus 5%). The reasons for this are unclear. In conclusion, there is a need for continued, largescale, clinico-epidemiological surveillance to collect data on clinical presentations of NTHi, risk factors, management and NTHi-attributable death.

Candida and Aspergillus species are the predominant pathogens. Candida bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic critically ill patients. Risk factors associated are diverse and include exposure to broad spectrum antimicrobial agents, mucosal colonization, indwelling vascular catheters, surgery and cancer chemotherapy. Differences in geographical epidemiology are emerging, in particular regarding a shift towards non-albicans species. This shift has been correlated with routine fluconazole administration. Aspergillus spp. can cause a wide spectrum of diseases in humans, including allergy, superficial infection, and invasive disease. Invasive aspergillosis has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The most important species are Aspergillus fumigatus followed by Aspergillus flavus. Contemporaneously, infections with rare molds are on rise. Zygomyzetes, Trichosporon, Fusarium, Alternaria, Pseudallescheria and dematiaceous fungi are recognized more frequently. The emergence of these organisms is multifactorial and can be related to more intense immunosuppression, the prolonged survival of patients, and the selective pressure of broad spectrum antifungal agents used for prophylaxis or therapy. Among these rare mould infections, the zygomycetes are the most commonly encountered, and appear to be associated with the use of voriconazole. Aspergillus terreus, a species that is resistant to amphotericin B, and less frequently, A. ustus and A. lentulus, have been noted increasingly as causes of invasive aspergillosis in some tertiary care centres. Scedosporium with innate resistance to many antifungal agents have emerged as major causes of disseminated infections, followed by infections due to Fusarium species. Dematiaceous, or brown-black, fungi, most often associated with chronic localised infections, are now increasingly reported as a cause of disseminated infection in immunosuppressed hosts. Watchful surveillance, rapid detection of disease, adequate treatment and effective control measures are highly warranted in the optimal management of these difficult to treat fungal infections.",

The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae Empiric antibiotic coverage for these resistant organisms should be considered in community patients presenting with sepsis involving the urinary tract especially in patients with certain risk factors such recent antibiotic use, residence in a longterm care facility, recent hospitalization, males older than 65 years and recent travel to a high-risk area. Failure to initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy from the start appears to be responsible for higher patient mortality. Studies from different parts of the world shows that that up to 5 percent of the population in the community can be rectally colonized by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae but the large scale introduction of these bacteria into the hospital setting has not yet been demonstrated.

On the other side, there are new opportunities following the introduction of new techniques such as PCR, MALDI-TOF and in particular the availability of automated inoculation and plate reading systems to replace manual labour. Reactions to these challenges differ, ranging from outsourcing to non-hospital based specialized microbiology labs to various forms of cooperation between smaller labs. This cooperation can exist in centralizing a part of or almost all activity in a central hospital-based lab or can be a network with a division of labor between collaborating labs. All these solutions share one factor. By increasing size, they seek to increase cost-efficiency and facilitate the introduction of new, specialized and expensive techniques. Outsourcing is often rejected because it risks reducing microbiology to a purely analytical activity with little microbiologist-dependent added-value. Concentrating smaller microbiology labs in one central lab or networking may not always be possible for practical reasons and will again increase the distance between clinical microbiologists and some of the microbiological tests. A solution that can assure a sufficient lab size even in mediumsized hospitals without the need for collaboration with other labs or outsourcing is integration of the microbiology lab with other pathology labs such as clinical chemistry or clinical hematology. This kind of integration can combine economy of scale with conserving the microbiological activity within the hospital and thus the close link between microbiology and infectious disease and infection control specialists. Integration of laboratories in its simplest form can exist in sharing of machines and lab space. It can also lead to an integration of all diagnostic activity according to common workflows. An example is an integrated unit for molecular testing performing all nucleic acid based testing; microbiological, hematological but also human genetics or forensic medicine. This integrated lab demands new ways of organizing lab activity. Essential to the integrated lab is a separation of medical and technical expertise and medical and organizational responsibility.",

Our first approach is to isolate viral and fungal antigen reactive T lymphocytes from donor blood and expand them ex vivo before infusing them into the stem cell recipients. We have generated T lymphocytes that are specific for common viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus, and engineer them to expand efficiently in vivo. They have proved effective at preventing and treating serious virus illness in the target patient populations and we are now extending this approach to the treatment of fungal disease. Our second approach is to remove alloreactive T cells from donor PBM and infuse these depleted T cells to produce broad immune reconstitution. As a further safety measure to prevent GvHD from the infused cells, we incorporate a new suicide gene composed of a modified caspase 9 that can be activated by a small molecule drug. Early clinical results show high safety and efficacy of the approach. We have also developed tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, using both native and chimeric receptors directed to tumor associated antigens. We express the chimeric receptors in virus specific T lymphocytes, thus gaining the benefit of both an antiviral and an antitumor response from the same infused T-cells. These approaches appear to be extremely cost effective and to have a high margin of safety.",

It has been shown recently that HEV can lead to chronic infection in solid-organ transplant recipients. Liver fibrosis progression in this population can be very rapid, leading to liver cirrhosis within a few years after infection. Virological tools are crucial not only for diagnosis but also for determining the incidence of HEV infections in solid-organ transplant recipients. Although the sensitivity of EIA tests for detecting anti-HEV antibodies among immunocompromised patients may be poor, the performances of the anti-HEV IgM assays appear to be useful for identifying a recent HEV infection.

Schwab, C. Geffers, M. Behnke, P. Gastmeier (Giessen, Berlin, DE) Objectives: To evaluate the incidence densities (IDs) of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and screening and control measures in intensive care units (ICUs) participating in the German Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (KISS). Methods: The surveillance module for multidrug-resistant bacteria in ICUs (MDR-KISS) collects data on all MRSA cases in participating ICUs with the aim to provide a national reference and a tool for monitoring and evaluation of infection control management. The median IDs of MRSA cases per 1000 patient-days (pd) with the interquartile range (IQR) are calculated for all MRSA cases and for the subcategories of imported and ICU-acquired cases from the pooled data of all ICUs as a reference for comparison with local MRSA IDs. In 2008 a detailed questionnaire regarding ICU structure, microbiological diagnostics, MRSA screening procedures, MRSA control measures, infection control education and implementation of surveillance was sent to all participating ICUs. The association between questionnaire results and high MRSA IDs (>75% percentile) was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Results: 186 ICUs with 298631 patients and 1064246 pd had submitted data on 4730 MRSA cases for 2007-2008 and had completed the questionnaire. Median MRSA IDs in these ICUs were 3.23 (IQR 1.19-5.68), 2.05 (IQR 0.62-4.22) and 0.61 (IQR 0.14-1.35) per 1000 pd for all cases, imported and ICU-acquired cases, respectively. Routine screening for MRSA was performed in 142 (76.3%) ICUs, with conventional MRSA detection methods used in 74 ICUs (39.8%), PCRbased screening in 11 ICUs (5.9%) and both methods in 57 ICUs (30.6%). The most relevant screening procedures and control measures are shown in table 1. Of all variables derived from the questionnaire only the variables general admission screening of all patients (odds ratio 8.2, p < 0.001) and screening of admitted patients at regular intervals (odds ratio 4.9, p < 0.001) were independently associated with high MRSA IDs. Conclusion: Considerable differences exist in MRSA incidence densities, screening and control measures in German ICUs. MRSA screening procedures have the most important impact on MRSA incidence densities. ICUs decide to perform a general admission screening probably because they have realized their MRSA problem. Objectives: Screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) became mandatory in the UK for all elective and day case admissions from April 2009 and will be mandatory for all emergency admissions from April 2011. Data to assess the effectiveness of this strategy at an individual hospital level are lacking. We analyzed our screening programme data to determine the number needed to test (NNT) to detect a colonised patient across a range of clinical specialties, and develop a risk assessment strategy for MRSA screening. Methods: MRSA screens of nose and groin were performed using chromogenic agar, with additional sites such as wounds and catheters included when present. In our hospital, MRSA screening data were resolved prospectively to individual patient level as opposed to a commonly utilized approximation using matched census (admission) data. Screening data were mapped to a patient administration system database containing relevant speciality codes. Mismatches where no screening results existed for individual patients were investigated weekly and included identification of patients in specific categories excluded from screening. Screening efficiency by specialty was fed back weekly to clinical teams to drive improved performance. Rates of MRSA positivity and NNT to detect a positive patient were determined for each specialty. Results: For the 12 months from October 2008, the laboratory performed >160,000 MRSA swabs on 51,855 individuals costing 600,000 Euros. Screening efficiency for elective admissions improved from 60% to 99% (2228/2249) and for emergency admissions from 76% to 97% (2996/3077). Overall, 1.2% of hospital admissions were MRSA positive, with 1.6%, 0.7% and 0.6% being MRSA positive in emergency, elective and day case cases respectively. The highest MRSA positivity rates were seen in emergency cases in hepatology (4.3%), interventional radiology (3.7%) and vascular surgery (3.3%). 1.5% of elective vascular surgery patients were MRSA positive. The lowest MRSA positivity rate was in day case orthopaedics where 1,006 patients were screened without detecting a single positive patient. NNT to detect a positive ranged from 24 to >1,006 depending on clinical speciality and admission type. Conclusions: Accurate data on results of MRSA screening can be used to assess both risk for individual patient admissions and the cost effectiveness of screening in specific patient groups, and to enhance the efficiency of the screening process. [1995] [1996] was 0.56 and 0.10, respectively. Neither the level nor the trend chenged after In1. Rates were significantly reduced to 0.28 and 0.04 after In2, and to 0.07 and 0.02 after In3, respectively, and were kept in those levels since 2008. There was no significant changes in the rate of bacteraemia due to methicllinsusceptible S. aureus. The results cannot be explained by changes in the case-mix or antibiotic consumption. The segmented regression model is shown in the table. 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations and the expected value of perfect information on the parameters was high (~\u00a310,000). Conclusion: With no microbial resistance to decolonisation agents, all decolonisation strategies were cost-effective, particularly decolonisation of MRSA positive admissions identified through PCR screens. These models allow uncertainty in decision making to be quantified and highlight parameters on which more information is needed to ensure cost-effective decisions, in this case the probability of progressing from colonisation to infection for decolonised and 'un-decolonised' patients.",

In the management of bacterial infections, identification of the pathogen following growth remains essential to propose as soon as possible the most appropriate treatment before the availability of antibiotic susceptibility. The strategy for most common pathogens requires Gram staining, the results of simple tests such as determination of oxidase and catalase activity and appropriate phenotypic tests using commercial identification kits and/or automated systems. A new proteomic strategy is progressively changing this strategy by identifying bacterial or fungal species grown on plates within minutes. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-offlight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) of intact bacteria yield reproducible spectrum depending upon strain or species. Using whole viable bacteria we describe here the application of MALDI-TOF-MS to the identification of bacterial pathogens isolated in routine clinical microbiology laboratories. Our aim was, once a primary isolate of a bacterium has grown onto a plate, to identify spectral prints, in the MALDI-TOF spectrum, that can be used to recognize the genus or the species. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed using bacteria obtained from one isolated colony. Over 400 clinically relevant bacterial species were selected. For each of these species one or several references strain was (were) selected to establish spectral prints. For each strain, only peaks that were conserved in the spectra of all 10 isolated colonies and with a relative intensity above 0.1 were retained, thus leading to a set of 3 to 30 selected peaks per strain. For each group of pathogens the database was validated using a set of isolates identified using mostly 16S RNA sequencing. The use of this strategy to identify bacterial species in clinical microbiology laboratories will be presented.",

Illnesses from food-borne pathogens are avoidable if technologies are used to maximize safety of food and water, populations are educated in self-care, and medical therapies are advanced for early diagnosis and treatment. Since selfcare strategies require alteration of usual cultural and habitual behavior, education efforts have limited success with the elderly. Why is it difficult to teach the elderly how to handle food safely and what are the consequences for failure to heed professional advice? Medically, when is a person elderly? When does the body begin senescence and susceptibility to opportunistic infections increase? The aging immune system is the primary reason for susceptibility to food-borne pathogens in the elderly. Natural, senescent immunity is exacerbated by the immune insufficiency of chronic disease and pharmacological therapies common in the population. Immune insufficiency associated with malnutrition becomes a causative factor as the physical and mental capacity of the aging individual deteriorates. Poor hygiene, failure to handle and store foods safely, and inability to distinguish between safe and tainted food may all be consequences of diminished mental or general health. For those in group housing, failure of care staff to heed food handling guidance could affect the health of multiple residents due to wide-spread exposure and immune insufficiency. Yet, acceptance of well-meaning advice to change poor health habits is limited due to lack of trust in the efficacy of the information, information that is contrary to cultural and traditional practices, or the failure to recognize and accept the decline of physiological and mental health. The challenge to the health professional that is providing food safety guidance is to recognize the social, health and mental barriers that control the ability of the individual to act on the advice. The goal is no food-borne illness in the world, but reality is that when preventative care is no longer possible, palliative care must take its place. ",

            "text": "Herpes Zoster (shingles) is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus. It is characterized acutely by a painful rash, and 10\u221220% of patients experience prolonged pain (postherpetic neuralgia), which in rare cases can last for years and be debilitating. Both the incidence and severity of zoster increase with age. Treatment options for zoster and post herpetic neuralgia are limited and costly. A shingles vaccine was licensed in Europe and the United States in 2006 following the completion of the Shingles Prevention Study, a randomized controlled trial of 38,546 healthy adults; vaccination decreased both the incidence and severity of zoster over a median of 3 years. Primary efficacy was measured by a burden of illness score which combined incidence, duration and severity of pain. The vaccine decreased burden of illness by 61%, but the effects varied by age. Efficacy in preventing acute zoster declined with age at vaccination, and there was minimal efficacy past age 80 years. Vaccination reduced the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia at all ages by 66%. This was achieved by preventing acute zoster among patients aged 60\u221269 years, and attenuating disease in patients aged 70 years. Side effects were mild, but serious adverse events were more common in the vaccination group (1.9 percent vs. 1.3 percent, P = 0.03). Debate about the use of the vaccine revolves not around the effectiveness, but the cost-effectiveness, as the vaccine is expensive (\u20ac136 per dose). Published analyses have found incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from \u20ac18,500 to \u20ac76,500 per quality-adjusted life year. The vaccine appears to be most cost-effective among 65-to 70-year-olds, as the incidence of disease in this age group is high, but vaccine recipients are still able to mount a satisfactory immune response. Despite recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control that all adults aged 60 years receive the shingles vaccine, uptake in the US has been slow. Barriers to vaccination include difficulties with vaccine storage, variable insurance coverage, and competing priorities for primary care doctors. Since licensure, the cost of the vaccine has increased by 30%. Moreover, studies of willingnessto-pay suggest that current vaccine pricing is not acceptable to patients.",

Deforges, J.M. Le Glaunec, N. Launay, R. Vergne, A. Minaret, M. Marzouk, M. Marmiesse\u00b0, N. Finnstr\u00f6m, P. Legrand (Creteil, Maurens-Scopont, FR) Objectives: GeneXpert (Cepheid) is an automated real-time PCR system which is very easy to use and suitable for emergency use. The principle of the Xpert MTB/RIF test, running on GeneXpert, is to detect M. tuberculosis complex and mutations in the gene rpoB that cause resistance to rifampicin. This is done directly from at minimum of 500 ml of a respiratory sample. After 15 min treatment of the sample all stages of the sample preparation and PCR takes place within the instrument in 1 h30. Some restrictions of use led us to validate this system on various types of samples. Methods: Respiratory samples were decontaminated with NACl/NaOH and 500 ml of decontaminated product added to 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (provided with the Xpert product). For non-respiratory nondecontaminated samples (CSF, pleural liquid and biopsies) the sample volume was sometimes too low. In these cases distilled water was added up to 500 ml before addition of lysis buffer. For solid culture one colonie was resuspended in 500 ml of distilled water, for liquid culture 500 ml of medium were centrifuged prior to addition of lysis buffer. Fifteen decontaminated respiratory samples (PPD) and 24 nonpulmonary samples ( Objectives: Although leprosy is treated by multidrug therapy since 1982, resistance to the first-line drug (dapsone, rifampicin) is described for 30 years and resistance to second-line drug as fluoroquinolones is described since 1997. Since Mycobacterium leprae is not growing in vitro, its susceptibility testing (one year experiment in the mouse footpad) is rarely done. Molecular methods are thus necessary to detect antibiotic resistance in leprosy and are so far in house methods requiring sequencing. Our aim was to provide a commercially based molecular test able to detect for antibiotic resistance in leprosy. Methods: M. leprae strains contained in biopsy skin samples were studied for resistance to dapsone, rifampicin and ofloxacin by the reference drug susceptibility method (the mouse footpad method). DNA was extracted and regions involved in resistance to the three drugs (rpoB gene for rifampicin, gyrA gene for ofloxacin and folP1 gene for dapsone resistance) were amplified and sequenced. The new DNA strip test, GenoType \u00ae LepraeDR, was applied blindly. Results were compared to those obtained by the genotypic method (PCR sequencing) and the phenotypic reference method (mouse footpad).",

Objectives: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is known as the etiological agent of paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) in ruminants. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory gastrointestinal tract disease in humans, presenting with similar symptoms and pathological changes in the gut as Johne's disease in cattle. Therefore, it was suggested that MAP could be one of the etiologic factors of the disease. The aim of the present study was to develop a MAP-specific real-time PCR assay providing the additional possibility of detecting viable MAP. Methods: A real-time PCR assay based on amplification of the specific Mptb52.16 target was designed including an internal amplification control to identify false negative results. The detection limit was established in artificially contaminated raw milk samples and the optimized assay applied to 96 naturally contaminated raw milk samples. The potential of the real-time PCR assay to detect viable MAP was explored by assessing expression of the Mptb52.16 target in raw milk samples and inoculated Dubos broth.",

In a survey of naturally contaminated samples obtained from dairy herds with a known history of paratuberculosis, 47.8% pre-milk and 51.9% main milk samples tested positive. Real-time PCR-derived MAP-specific bacterial cell equivalents (BCE) ranged from 1\u00d710 0 to 5.1\u00d710 2 BCE/51.44 ml; the majority of samples had less than one BCE per ml milk.

Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine whether the activation of a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cell-mediated response during pre-emptive therapy controls further replication episodes without valganciclovir administration in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients at high risk for CMV infection. Methods: SOT recipients at high risk for CMV infection, those that are seronegative and receive a seropositive graft, were followed for 18 months after transplantation. CMV viral loads (VL) were determined by real-time PCR, and the CMV-specific immune response was characterized by flow cytometry by the detection of CD4+, CD8+ and CD3+ T cells expressing CD69 and secreting IFN-g and IL-2. Preemptive treatment was administered when VL reached 1,000 copies/ml. Once a CMV-specific immune response was detected no treatment was administered and patients were closely monitored. Results: Eleven patients with a median age of 53 years were included. Between 2 and 7 weeks after transplantation, all patients experienced CMV replication episodes that ranged from 787 to 1,432,217 copies/ml. All of them were resolved after administration of valganciclovir. Between weeks 10 and 20 post-transplantation a CMV-specific immune response was detected in all patients. After this, 33 replication episodes were detected, 32 of which (97%) were controled by the host immune system without the administration of treatment (VL ranging from 10 to 31,317 copies/ml). Furthermore, although the number of positive PCR results was similar before and after the acquisition of immunity, VL levels were significantly lower (p = 0.017) after immunity than before with median values of 1,696 copies/ml and 20,110 copies/ml, respectively. From week 39 to week 51 all replication episodes were 1,000 copies/ml and no new replication episodes were detected after week 51.",

Most HHV-6 reactivations are asymptomatic, but symptoms such as encephalitis, hepatitis or graft dysfunction have been described. The clinical experience on antiviral therapy is very limited, but based on in vitro studies, the current antiviral drugs effective against cytomegalovirus (CMV), have also activity against HHV-6. However, ganciclovir is less effective against HHV-6B than HHV-6A. The aim of our study was to investigate the efficiency of antiviral prophylaxis, given to the CMVseronegative risk patients receiving the graft from the seropositive donor, in preventing HHV-6B reactivation. Methods: Of 232 consecutive adult liver transplant patients 36 belonging to the CMV high risk group received valganciclovir (or ganciclovir) prophylaxis up to 3 months after transplantation. The patients were frequently monitored for CMV by real-time quantitative PCR and HHV-6 reactivations were demonstrated by the antigenemia test in PBMC by using indirect immunoperoxidase staining and monoclonal antibodies against HHV-6B and HHV-6A. Intragraft HHV-6 infection was demonstrated in liver biopsies by using the same antibodies and immunostaining. Results: During antiviral prophylaxis, no break-through CMV infections were recorded. On the contrary, HHV-6 antigenemia was detected in 13/36 (36%) patients appearing mean 12 days (range 7\u221222 days) after transplantation. All reactivations were caused by HHV-6B.

Results: Eleven renal transplant adult recipients were identified as having Caliciviridae infection, including 10 NoV and 1 SpV. All of them were given an induction immunosuppressive therapy relayed by a triple maintenance therapy. The median time from transplantation to symptoms and from then to diagnosis were 21 months (range: 1\u221283) and 30 days (range: 9-154), respectively. All patients had protracted diarrhea, requiring hospitalization and IV rehydration. Vomiting and fever were present in 5 (45%) and 2 (18%) patients, respectively. All but one experienced weight loss with an average loss of 4.5\u00b12.2 kg, 8 (72%) of them presented with acute renal failure. Patient-to-patient nosocomial transmission was very likely in two patients who shared the same hospital room and in whom the same variant was identified.

Objectives: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection may cause significant morbidity and mortality in the immuno-compromised patient. VZV vaccine induces both humoral and cellular immunity. However, there is no clear correlation between IgG antibody titers and protection against infection. Antibody protection is a function of both concentration and affinity (=chemical binding strength). Avidity is a measure of functional affinity. It has been suggested that studies of vaccine efficacy should incorporate analysis of avidity, since high avidity is a marker of memory priming. The present study was designed in order to answer the question as to whether solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients have a lower VZV IgG antibody avidity, despite having protective IgG antibody levels after vaccination, or not. Methods: The serum samples of SOT recipients were evaluated for IgG antibody levels against VZV and IgG antibody avidity. Twenty-eight patients were included in the study (20 had had liver transplantation, 3 heart transplantation, 5 kidney transplantation) and had received a single dose of Varivax (Aventis Pasteur, Lyon, France) prior to transplantation. The control group consisted of 50 healthy children, 36 of whom had had clinical and serological confirmed varicella infection after wild-virus contact and 14 of whom had varicella vaccination with a single dose of Varivax. Results: Median IgG antibody levels were 800 U/ml in wild-virus infected controls, 810 U/ml in vaccinated controls and 630 U/ml in SOT recipients. Median relative avidity index (RAI) was 89% for wild-virus infected controls, 94% for vaccinated controls and 82% for transplant recipients (p = 0.01 compared to wild-virus infected controls, p = 0.002 compared to vaccinated controls). Conclusions: In conclusion, IgG antibody avidity in SOT recipients may serve as a substitute marker to evaluate humoral immunity against VZV. This is of particular importance in the clinical setting of exposure to VZV when considering VZV-specific immunglobulin and/or acyclovir treatment in order to prevent clinical relevant re-infection and varicella-caused complications as a result of exposure to VZV after transplantation. However, the role of humoral protection against VZV has to be evaluated in long-term follow-up, since also cellular immunity may play a crucial role in defence against viral infections. (32%). Gram-positive organisms were the most frequent aetiological agents overall (43%). Gram-negative organisms were the primary aetiological agents in the early postoperative period (<1 week). In week one post-OLT, 73% (8/11) of BSIs were due to Gram-negative organisms (85% abdominal source). Grampositive organisms predominated after the first post-operative week, causing 70% (7/10) of BSIs. Crude mortality of BSIs was 33%, being highest in the early post-operative period. Among the Gram-positive isolates, 8% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci and there was no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated.

            "text": "Critical care is widely acknowledged as an important predisposing factor, with a third of candidaemia episodes occurring in the ICU. This is chiefly because ICU patients are exposed to many of the risk factors, which include compromises to natural barriers of infection; Candida colonisation and alterations in normal flora; and the presence of debilitating diseases or immunosuppression, particularly neutropenia. Invasive Candida infections also occur outside the ICU, as the cardinal risk factors are present in a variety of patient types, including patients undergoing major abdominal surgery; bone marrow and solid-organ transplant patients; and patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Although risk factors for invasive Candida infections are well characterised, definitive diagnosis remains problematic due to the long lead times associated with blood culture and histopathology. Targeted treatment, i.e. selection of an antifungal agent tailored to a particular Candida species with known antifungal susceptibility, is rarely possible initially. Consequently, pre-emptive and empirical strategies, which make use of the limited information available to guide treatment decisions, are commonly employed. Patients with invasive Candida infections are often severely ill prior to developing a fungal infection. Therefore, rapid initiation of therapy is vital, as the risk of mortality increases significantly with any delay in treatment. However, it is also important to consider carefully the choice of agent, as differences exist in microbiological and clinical efficacy. Many cases of invasive Candida infections are caused by species that are potentially resistant to older antifungals, particularly fluconazole. Therefore, if the causative agent is unknown, or is suspected to be a fluconazole-resistant species (i.e. C. glabrata or C. krusei), a broadspectrum antifungal agent should be selected first-line, with recent guidelines recommending echinocandins as the best overall choice. Differences also exist between the echinocandins, particularly with regard to their suitability for use in certain patient populations. Therefore, careful assessment of individual cases is the optimal basis for selection of therapy. Micafungin, which was evaluated in an extensive clinical trial programme and has to date been administered in 600,000 patients worldwide, is a recognised treatment option.",

The IDSA and other guidelines highlight ongoing clinical challenges, which more recent antibiotics are helping to address. For example, clinical evidence of reduced MRSA susceptibility to vancomycin has prompted the IDSA to recommend daptomycin* in institutions where vancomycin MICs >2 mg/ml are common. Bacteraemia caused by vancomycinresistant enterococci is also of increasing concern. Therapeutic options are limited and recent novel antibiotics may be helpful in these cases. Haemodialysis patients have particular risk factors for catheterassociated bacteraemia. Catheter removal may pose logistical problems; however, failure or delay in removal increases the risk of haematogenous spread. Compared with catheter retention, removal of S. aureus-infected catheters is associated with a more rapid response to therapy and/or a higher cure rate. Furthermore, success rates for catheter salvage using adjunctive antibiotic lock therapy are lower for Gram-positive pathogens, such as S. aureus, enterococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis, than for Gram-negative infections.

Mortality is significantly worse in patients with primary or secondary BSI compared with catheter-related bacteraemia and also in those infected with MRSA vs MSSA. Furthermore, inappropriate empiric treatment for patients with Gram-positive bacteraemia increases mortality risk. Treatment guidelines for bacteraemia are primarily based on specific infection foci, such as IE and catheter-related infections. Empiric treatment for bacteraemia should take account of the likely pathogen and local susceptibility patterns, in addition to presenting symptoms, patients' general heath status and medical history (including risk factors for MDR involvement), comorbidities (e.g. renal impairment) and concomitant medications. When the infection focus is not a vascular catheter, management should also address the risk of complications, particularly related to S. aureus, and the need for some patients to receive prolonged therapy, potentially with initial hospital treatment followed by continued antimicrobial therapy post-discharge. Daptomycin* is one of the few antibiotics with efficacy and safety in the treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia, including that associated with IE.

            "text": "Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and osteomyelitis (OST) are difficult to eradicate and remain an ongoing challenge for treating physicians. Until recently, prosthetic surgery was usually approached as either a two-stage exchange, separated by a long interval (6\u22128 weeks), or lifelong antibiotic suppression therapy. The first approach is associated with prolonged hospitalisation and risks of secondary complications; the second has a low probability of success. Antimicrobials effective against slow-growing, stationary growth-phase and adherent microorganisms are needed to eradicate biofilm infections. This presentation will discuss novel treatment concepts and their impact on long-term outcomes and also recently updated treatment guidelines for PJI and OST. The choice to retain or remove an implant depends on the patient profile: in specific groups, implant infections can be cured by early debridement and long-term treatment with antibiotics that have good biofilm activity. Antimicrobial type, doses and duration of therapy will be discussed. Potentially, newer antibiotics such as daptomycin* may prove to be valuable options in implant-associated methicillinresistant staphylococcal and enterococcal infections. Treatment protocols of phase II studies with daptomycin with or without rifampin in PJI and OST will be reviewed as well as the use of higher doses of daptomycin. Common pitfalls and reasons for treatment failure will be outlined. Empiric antibiotic therapy should not be administered before microbiological diagnostic confirmation, which is difficult when antibiotics are administered for a draining wound overlying an implant. In addition, the risk of development of antimicrobial resistance is high, particularly for rifampin. Therefore, rifampin should be avoided if there is contact between the body surface and the implant (e.g. open wounds, wound dehiscence, fistulae, vacuum-assisted closure foam or drainage). Other common mistakes are insufficient duration and/or dose of antibiotics and switching from intravenous to oral agents with insufficient bioavailability or inactivity against biofilms. *Daptomycin is licensed in Europe for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infection (cSSTI) at a dose of 4 mg/kg od and for Staphylococcus aureus right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) and S. aureus bacteraemia when associated with cSSTI or RIE at a dose of 6 mg/kg od. Recent years have witnessed dramatic shifts in the prevalence and nature of antibiotic resistance. Key changes include: (i) the rise and, in some countries, subsequent decline of MRSA, also (ii) the rise of quinolone and cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli and Klebsiella spp., with CTX-M ESBLs increasingly the dominant source of the cephalosporin resistance, (iii) the proliferation of A. baumannii with OXA carbapenemases and (iv) the 'loss' of fluoroquinolones against gonorrhoea, with resistance rates as high as 90% in China. Treatment shifts predicated on these problems are now exerting their own selection pressure, favouring the spread of yet further resistances. The greatest concern for hospital medicine is the emergence of Enterobacteriaceae with acquired carbapenemases, including the IMP, VIM, and NDM metallo-types, the class A enzyme KPC and the class D enzyme, OXA-48. At present, Enterobacteriaceae with these enzymes are proliferating in different parts of the world: NDM in India, OXA-48 in Turkey, VIM in Greece and KPC in the US \u2212 but the stability of this distribution is unpredictable, in view of migration and medical tourism. In general, the IMP, VIM and NDM enzymes are spread by plasmids, whilst accumulation of K. pneumoniae isolates with KPC enzyme largely involves dissemination of the ST258 clone. 'Loss' of the carbapenems against Enterobacteriaceae would be a public health catastrophe, in view of the lack of alternative therapies for infections due to multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria. A shift that should be of greater concern than it is presently receiving is the erosion of the antigonococcal activity of cephalosporins. Owing to changes to PBPs, porins and efflux it is increasingly common to see N. gonorrhoeae isolates with cefixime and ceftriaxone MICs of 0.12\u22120.5 mg/L, representing the edge of treatability, again with a lack of convenient alterative therapies. Future risks are harder to predict but potentially include transferable resistance to new anti-Gram-positive agents, and it is notable here that many soil streptomycetes can degrade daptomycin. Such organisms were the sources of several other resistance genes that have spread to mobile DNA and into clinical pathogens. But, as the saying goes, 'Prediction is very hard, especially when it concerns the future' and only two things are certain: that neither evolution nor resistance surprises have stopped yet.",

Studies of antibiotic use patterns consistently demonstrate frequent inappropriate prescribing and low adherence to antibiotic prescription (ABP) guidelines, a factor likely to increase the emergence of resistant organisms. Behavioural aspects of the antibiotic prescription remain largely unknown. We explored beliefs and perceptions associated with measured knowledge about ABP in two French university hospitals. Physicians in charge of ABP in inpatient hospital wards were asked to participate. Volunteers completed in a same meeting (less than 1 hour): (i) 4 case vignettes presenting infectious situations and exploring 4 aspects: whether hospitalization was needed, initiation and choice of AB, re-evaluation at day 2\u22123, and treatment duration and (ii) a self-reported questionnaire to collect data about their own belief and perception regarding ABP.

LRTIs comprise a continuum of different severities of infections ranging from typically self limiting acute bronchitis, to more severe acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and to life-threatening bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Clinical signs and symptoms, and traditional laboratory parameters are unreliable to distinguish viral from bacterial LRTI. As a consequence, up to 75% of LRTI are treated with antibiotics, despite their mainly viral origin leading ultimately to emergence of bacterial resistance. To limit antibiotic overuse, rapid and more accurate differentiation of clinically relevant bacterial LRTI from other causes is key. A novel approach to estimate the probability of a bacterial origin of LRTIs is meas-urement of serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels. PCT increases rapidly upon infection (3\u22126 hours) and decreases upon recovery. PCT correlates with severity and has prognostic implications. Its kinetics makes it a good marker for assessing the effectiveness of treatment, which is a prerequisite for safe guidance of antibiotic therapy. PCT levels can be used to guide antibiotic therapy in individual patients as a surrogate biomarker. Antibiotic stewardship based on PCT cut off ranges has successfully been implemented in patients with LRTI in different clinical settings. Thereby, initiation or continuation of antibiotics was more or less discouraged (<0.1 ug/L or <0.25 ug/L) or encouraged (>0.5 ug/L or >0.25 ug/L) (Figure 1 ). If PCT values are increased and antibiotics therapy is initiated, repeated PCT measurements are recommended and antibiotics can be discontinued using the same cut-off ranges. This clinical algorithm was prospectively tested in different intervention trials in the emergency room, in the intensive care unit, in primary care and recently, this concept has been externally validated in a large Swiss nation-wide multi centre trial including over 1350 patients. Overall, PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship reduced antibiotic prescription rate by 40\u221250% in patients with acute bronchitis or AECOPD; in CAP, it reduced the initial prescription rate by about 10%, but importantly shortened the duration of antibiotic therapy by 65% with a similar outcome in patients with all severities. Similarly, PCT guidance safely reduced antibiotic exposure by more than 75% in primary care patients with upper and lower RTI9. Thereby, PCT guidance significantly reduced antibiotic-related side effects, especially diarrhoea and nausea.",

Molecular epidemiology studies suggested that the sudden worldwide increase of multi-resistant CTX-M-producing E. coli (especially CTX-M-15) is mostly due to a single clone named ST131 and that foreign travel to high-risk areas such as the Indian subcontinent might play in part a role in spread of this clone across different continents. Clone ST131 that produce CTX-M ESBLs (i.e. most often CTX-M-15 but also CTX-M-3 and CTX-M-14) is associated with IncFII and IncI1 multi-resistance plasmids and certain virulence factors such as malX, ompT and usp.

However, variants of TEM-1 and SHV-1 that can hydrolyze extended spectrum cephalosporins have evolved in clinical isolates over the last two decades, which has limited treatment options. These evolved enzymes, termed extendedspectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs), contain from one to five amino acid substitutions that result in increased catalytic efficiency of the enzymes for hydrolysis of extended spectrum cephalosporins. Sitedirected and random mutagenesis studies have revealed that the amino acid substitutions commonly found in the evolved variants increase the catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of extended spectrum cephalosporins and, in some cases, stabilize the evolved enzymes.

Direct smear of exudates from ulcerated lesions in situ, or fine needle aspirates (FNA) from nonulcerated lesions, or biopsy specimens 2. In vitro cultivation of M. ulcerans from exudates, FNA or biopsies. 3. Gel-based or quantitative real-time PCR targeting IS2404. 4. Histopathologic examination (important in both BU diagnosis and differential diagnosis). Numerous other infectious and noninfectious diseases and neoplasms are diagnosed among clinically suspected cases of BU. Tropical phagedenic ulcer is the most common diagnostic problem. Options for therapy for BU are surgery, antibiotics, or combinations of both. Antibiotic therapy for all forms is gaining acceptance. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends, if not contraindicated, the directly observed use of at least an 8-week course of oral rifampin and streptomycin by intramuscular injection. This antibiotic treatment may also be combined with surgery. Other antibiotic regimens, especially those administered completely orally, are under evaluation. Severe ZN positive lesions (large ulcers and disseminated forms) should receive specific antibiotherapy and should be surgically treated without delay to avoid deterioration of lesions and possible bone dissemination. Objectives: Mesotherapy is an increasing used technique involving subcutaneous injections of minute quantity of various medical drugs for cosmetic or rheumatism purposes. This practice was already reported to be related to infection risk.",

Artemisinins have become the most essential class of antimalarials, their impact comparable only to that of chloroquine in the mid 20th century. Spreading artemisinin resistance could therefore have a devastating impact on malaria control efforts throughout the malaria-endemic world. In the current situation losing a single class of antimalarial drugs to resistance may severely impact the ability of many countries to treat falciparum malaria. The concept of artemisinin resistance has been a contentious one for many years, with some authorities suggesting that it was unlikely to arise in the first place. However, recent data indicate that the first cases of genuine artemisinin resistance have already emerged in western Cambodia. We may already be losing artemisinins in selected parts of the world. Our data showing individual parasite isolates resistant to high doses of artemisinins, prolonged parasite clearance times, and reduced in vitro drug response indicate that this phenomenon is as yet limited to a relatively small proportion of the parasite isolates and probably also to a relatively small area in Southeast Asia. Once it starts spreading, resistance to artemisinin derivatives, currently the most essential antimalarial drugs, could very well be the most devastating event in the history of malaria control in the 21st century. Artemisinin-resistant malaria is a new emerging disease that will require new treatment and control strategies to limit the impact and spread of resistance to the rest of the malaria-endemic world.",

Pneumocystis colonization is defined as detection of the organism or its DNA without signs or symptoms of pneumonia. Sensitive molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction are frequently utilized to identify colonization. Accumulating evidence suggests that colonization with Pneumocystis may be an important clinical phenomenon. The clinical significance of colonization is not yet fully understood, but it may be important for several reasons. Colonized persons may be at risk of developing Pneumocystis pneumonia. Even if colonized individuals do not themselves develop Pneumocystis pneumonia, they might transmit the organism to others. Exposure to Pneumocystis-colonized animals leads to colonization of normal animals and to the development of clinical disease in immunosuppressed animals. Colonization in persons receiving long-term anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis may also lead to the development of mutations that have been associated with drug resistance. Furthermore, Pneumocystis may play a role in progression of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The presence of Pneumocystis in the lungs, even at low levels as seen in colonization, produces inflammatory changes similar to those seen in COPD, with increases in the numbers of neutrophils and cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. Colonization with Pneumocystis has been demonstrated in HIV-infected subjects, and HIV-infected smokers are particularly susceptible to Pneumocystis colonization regardless of CD4 cell count or use of Pneumocystis prophylaxis. Pneumocystis colonization is also increased in non-HIV-infected patients with COPD and is directly related to the severity of the disease. Models of Pneumocystis colonization in mice with smoke exposure and in non-human primates infected with an HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus chimera demonstrate the development of COPD-like changes. These studies suggest that treatment or prevention of Pneumocystis colonization in at-risk populations may be a novel therapy for COPD.",

            "text": "Epstein-Barr virus is a human herpesvirus that is known to infect and efficiently drive the activation and proliferation of resting B cells in vitro. It achieves this through the expression of nine latent proteins. However, in vivo EBV persists in a benign, dormant state in resting memory B cells. The link between these two observations is that in vivo EBV uses its latent proteins to activate newly infected cells in lymphoid tissue so that the cells can then differentiate through the germinal center to become resting memory cells. In doing so the virus infected cells mimic the normal process whereby antigen activated B cells become long term memory cells. At each stage of the process EBV uses different combinations of latent proteins. If at any stage the infected cell is unable to progress into the resting memory state it is at risk of becoming a tumor expressing the pattern of latent proteins characteristic of its particular stage of infection. Thus EBV is associated with several human malignancies including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, immunoblastic lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. Each of these tumors expresses a different pattern of latent proteins reflecting their origins from specific stages of the viral life cycle. Recently it has been shown that EBV also expresses~40miRNAs in latently infected cells. miRNAs are thought to play critical regulatory functions in normal and malignant cells but the roles of the EBV miRNAs remain unclear. It is also unknown if they are expressed in a tumor specific pattern like the latent proteins. In this presentation I will: 1. Discuss the mechanism of how EBV establishes persistent infection in memory B cells including recent evidence on how EBV usurps the germinal center process to gain access to the memory B cell compartment. 2. Detail how the model of EBV persistence explains the origin of the EBV associated tumors especially the lymphomas. 3. Demonstrate tumor specific expression profiles of miRNAs and a possible functional significance of these expression patterns.",

The inflammatory potential of PVL was tested on alveolar macrophages using mciroarray profiling, PCR and ELISA. Signaling pathways were investiagted using western blots and electromobility shift assays. The in vivo role of PVl was then studied in a murine pneumonitis model, in which lung tissue and lavage fluid was assessed for cell-influx and cytokine/chemokine release.

Under experimental conditions, conducive to optimal LTA stimulation, we found no differences between the immunostimulatory capacity of delta lgt LTA and wt-LTA arguing for a limited contribution of possible lipoprotein contaminants to wt-LTA mediated immune activation.

Conclusion: Our results not only suggest a novel mechanism for delta lgt-LTA mediated immune activation in human blood cells that involves an opsonization-dependent uptake and recognition process of LTA but also provide a conclusive explanation for the controversial findings obtained in previous experiments comparing the immunostimulatory capacity of delta lgt-LTA and wt-LTA.",

In this study we have investigated the effects of hypoxia on the activity of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB in alveolar epithelial cells in response to stimulation with P. aeruginosa. Methods: A549 lung epithelial cells were incubated with heat inactivated P. aeruginosa or specific TLR ligands (TLR2: Pam3CysSK4, TLR4: LPS, TLR5: flagellin) at 21% and 1% atmospheric oxygen. Activation of NF-kappaB was determined by immunoblotting of nuclear of p65 (NF-kappaB family member) and cytosolic Cox2 (target gene of NF-kappaB) as well as by luciferase activity, wereby A549 cells were transfected with a NRE-luciferase plasmid beforehand. Results: Incubation of cells with heat inactivated P. aeruginosa clearly increased nuclear p65 protein level and luciferase activity in a manner that was profoundly amplified by either epithelial cell hypoxia or hypoxic bacteria. Stimulation of innate immunity in alveolar epithelial cells is largely mediated by three toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5).

In order to address these discrepancies, we investigated host defense against disseminated candidiasis in knock-out mice defective in the various components of the inflammasome. Methods: Mice deficient in caspase-1, ASC, Nalp3 or P2X7 were infected intravenously with C. albicans. Survival, fungal outgrowth in the organs, histology, and modulation of cytokine production were compared in these mouse strains with the wild-type C57/Bl6 control mice. PBMCs from healthy volunteers with or without reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor and PBMCs from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) that are deficient in ROS production were stimulated with C. albicans. Results: Caspase-1\u2212/\u2212 mice and ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice had a decreased survival during disseminated candidiasis (50%) compared to the control mice (87%). Caspase-1\u2212/\u2212 mice had a 100-fold increase in fungal loads in the kidneys of the deficient animals and showed preferential growth of hyphae in the pyelum of the caspase-1\u2212/\u2212 mice accompanied by remarkbly little inflammation (Figure) . In contrast, ASC\u2212/\u2212 mice did not have higher fungal loads, but they showed a significantly stronger inflammatory reaction in the kidneys. ASC\u2212/\u2212splenocytes showed a higher TNF production after Candida stimulation. NLRP3\u2212/\u2212 and P2X7\u2212/\u2212 did not display an increased susceptibility to disseminated candidiasis. Local bioactive IL-1b and INFg in vivo was only affected in the caspase-1\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not in the ASC\u2212/\u2212, NLRP3\u2212/\u2212 or P2X7\u2212/\u2212 animals. In addition, caspase-1 was constitutively active in ROS deficient monocytes and C. albicans induced IL-1b production was not reduced in the absence of ROS. Conclusions: Caspase-1-dependent processes are important in antifungal host defense during Candida sepsis. In contrast to current thinking, these process are not dependent on the inflammasome components, ASC, NLRP3 and the ATP receptor P2X7. These data confirm previous studies in human monocytes showing that caspase-1 activation during Candida infection does not require pathogen-mediated in flammasome activation. ASC plays an important role in disseminated candidiasis, but unexpectedly seems to have a different function in vivo, specifically by regulating TNF production and local inflammation in the organs. Finally, ROS did not play a critical role in inflammasome activation and Candida-induced IL-1b production. Objectives: Amphotericin B (AmB) is an antifungal drug widely used for the treatment of fungal infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis, which is caused by the encapsulated fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. AmB binds to ergosterol and forms pores at the membrane, resulting in cell death. However, other reports indicate that AmB also acts as an oxidant. In this work we have studied the effect on AmB on C. neoformans. Methods: We have compared three viability methods: XTT assay, prodium iodide staining, and colony forming units enumeration. XTT is reduced in the mitochondria by living cells, producing a compound that is quantified spetrophotometrically. Propidium iodide is a DNA-binding fluorescent compound that only penetrates in the cells once they lose the membrane integrity. Finally, CFUs enumeration estimates the ability of the cells to replicate and form viable colonies. Results: While AmB inhibited the formation of colonies at concentrations above 0.5\u22121 mg/L, the cells did not become permeable to propidium iodide in the same conditions, suggestin that AmB has other effects on C. neoformans different than pore formation. When viability was measured using the XTT assay, a correlation with the CFUs results was observed, confirming that AmB exerts its killing effect intracellularly. However, we also observed a \"paradoxical effect\" in which cells treated with high AmB concentrations (4\u221216 mg/L) produced higher levels of reduced XTT than cells treated with intermediate AmB concentrations (0.25\u22121 mg/L). Since this \"paradoxical effect did not correlate with CFUs appearance, we argued that it might reflect an induction of the electron transfer in the mitochondria, as a consequence of an increased oxidative burst induced by AmB. So we measured the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells using dihydrofluorescein, a compound that when is attacked by free radicals releases fluorescence. Our results demonstrated that AmB induced a strong release of ROS in the cells, which correlates with the metabolic inactivation measured by the XTT assay. Conclusions: Although AmB can bind to ergosterol and produce pores at the membrane, our results indicate that this antifungal drug induces killing in C. neoformans mainly through an induction of a strong oxidative burst. These findings confirm that Am B has multiple effects on the cells, which suggests an explanation for the low antifungal resistance to this compound observed among clinical isolates. Objectives: The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the aetiological agent of Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, which affect near 20 million people with severe consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. The host's ability to generate a parasite-specific immune response plays an essential role in the control of the evolution and the severity of the disease. In particular, efficient CD8+ T cell responses are required for the immune control of the infection. Heat shock proteins have been characterized as immunodominant CD8+ antigens in several bacterial infections and tumours, but not still in parasitic diseases. The aim of this work is to know whether T. cruzi HSP70 is processed and presented to CD8+ T lymphocytes during natural infection. Methods: Peptides containing HLA-A*0201-binding motifs were selected using bioinformatics, and their binding affinity were evaluated using T2-binding assays. HSP70-immunized or T. cruzi infected C57BL-A2/Kb transgenic mice were used to predict immunodominant epitopes within the protein by cytotoxicity assays. The recognition of candidate peptides by circulating lymphocytes from chagasic patients were assessed through IFN-g secretion tests.",

The reason for the discrepancy in efficacy of live and killed vaccines is not yet known, in vivo and in vitro studies on T-cell function against live/killed stimulatory effect might provide valuable information. Methods: Nine leishmanin skin test (LST) positive donors with history of self healing CL (HCL) and seven healthy LST negative donors were included in this study. CD4+/CD8+/CD14+ cells were isolated from peripheral blood. 5,6-carboxyfluoescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeled CD4+ or CD8+ lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of 1:10 of mitomycin treated autologous monocytes and 100 micro g/ml killed Leishmania lysate (KLL) or 2.5\u00d710 5 /ml live Leishmania major (LLM). Cells were harvested after 7 days of incubation at 37\u00baC and analysed for proliferation using flow cytometry. Culture supernatants were collected on day 3 for IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-g titration using sandwich ELISA method. Results: In HCL volunteers, upon stimulation with KLL, the number of proliferated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (at division 4) was significantly more than unstimulated cells (P < 0.001) or LLM stimulated cells (P < 0.05) or cells from controls (P < 0.05 for CD4+ and P < 0.001 for CD8+ cells). Cells from HCL donors showed a significantly higher IL-10 production to LLM stimulation compared with KLL stimulation (P < 0.001 for CD4+ and P < 0.0005 for CD8+ cells) or comparing controls (P < 0.05 for CD4+ and P < 0.001 for CD8+ cells). Stimulation of CD4+ T cells with LLM (P < 0.001) or KLL (P < 0.05) induced a significantly higher IFN-g production compared to cells from controls, but LLM induced significantly more IFN-g than KLL (P < 0.05). On the CD8+ compartment, a significantly higher IFN-g production was observed when the cells were stimulated with LLM (P < 0.05). Results: Dectin-1 Y238X SNP was strongly correlated with Candida colonization in HSCT patients: 34% of the individuals bearing the wildtype allele were colonized with Candida, compared to 85% of the individuals bearing the mutant allele (p < 0.005), necessitating more frequent use of fluconazole treatment (p < 0.01). Functional assays demonstrated a loss-of-function phenotype of the SNP, as shown by the decreased cytokine production by immune cells bearing this SNP.",

Objective: Resistance to tuberculosis has been proposed as a mechanism for selection for high rates of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency. Mechanistically, low levels of this pattern recognition receptor may lead to relatively lower degrees of phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and protect against TB however evidence to date has been conflicting. We aimed to systematically review published literature on the effect of MBL2 genotype and/or MBL levels in tuberculosis infection, and perform meta-analysis considering its effect on susceptibility to infection. Serious Gram-positive infections are becoming increasingly difficult to treat because of the escalating incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In order to improve clinical outcomes and to select the most appropriate therapy, it is essential to consider pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters, such as PD targets and their relation to dosing and the use of PK parameters as measures of exposure. In addition, AUC/MIC ratios should be used to predict clinical efficacy, and the relationship between MICs and dosing requirements should be considered.",

IFI is an important cause of complications and mortality among hospitalised patients, especially among immunocompromised patients in the haematology setting. The potential of voriconazole (VORI) as primary and secondary prophylaxis for IFI has recently been evaluated in clinical trials in patients with haematological disease having undergone allogeneic transplantation. Methods: In the primary prophylaxis study IMPROVIT (A), patients 12 years were randomised to receive oral VORI or oral itraconazole (ITRA) from the day of transplantation, for 100-180 days; the primary composite endpoint was success of prophylaxis at Day 180 (i.e. survival without developing proven/probable IFI or discontinuing prophylaxis for >14 days during the first 100 days). In the secondary prophylaxis study VOSIFI (B), patients 18 years with proven/probable IFI in the previous 12 months received VORI 4 mg/kg/12 hours IV or 200 mg/12 hours PO within 48 hours post-conditioning chemotherapy, for 100-150 days; the primary endpoint was the incidence of proven/probable IFI during the subsequent 12 months. Results: In A, the success of prophylaxis was significantly higher in the VORI group (n = 234) compared with the ITRA group (n = 255) at Days 100 (55% vs 41%; 95% CI: 6%, 24%; p = 0.0007) and 180 (49% vs 35%; 95% CI: 7%, 24%; p = 0.0004). Significantly more patients treated with VORI than ITRA (54% vs 40%; p = 0.0014) had sufficient days of prophylaxis (median: 97 vs 68 days). While the incidence of IFI was low in both arms (VORI: 1.3%, ITRA: 2.4%), 3 patients receiving ITRA developed IFI compared with none on treatment with VORI. In B (n = 42), 3 cases of IFI occurred: 1 recurrent Candida albicans candidaemia, 1 recurrent Scedosporium prolificans fungaemia (fatal) and 1 new case of zygomycosis, at Day 3, 16, and 66 after transplant, respectively (incidence: 7%). The most common VORI-related adverse events were hepatotoxicity, nausea, headache and hallucinations/visual impairment (<15%). In A, there was no difference in 180-day survival (85% in each treatment group); in B, 11 patients (24%) died (median: 136 days post-transplant) but only 1 from IFI. Conclusion: Based on the results of these prophylaxis studies, VORI is an effective and safe option for both primary and secondary prevention of IFI after allogeneic transplantation.",

Besides Helicobacter pylori and some parasites there are mostly viruses for which a causative relation to malignant diseases has been demonstrated. Establishing such a link depends on the epidemiologic profile of the disease and the putative causal infectious agent as well as its biologic properties in experimental cell culture and in vivo models. Often one of the classical Koch's postulates (isolation of the putative agent from the affected tissue) cannot be fulfilled and, in some instances, not even traces of the microbe (i.e. its nucleic acid) can consistently be found in the tumor. The reason might be that cancer is the late and rare consequence of a chronic infection where replication of the infectious agent does no longer take place and gene functions are not required for maintenance of the tumor growth. Therefore a combination of observational and experimental strategies has to be applied to collect sufficient evidence and to initiate attempts for preventive measures that target the infectious agent such as development of vaccines.

Prior to that time, results for b-lactams were reported according to the test result, and specific detection of acquired narrow spectrum b-lactamases such as TEM-1 was not sought. With the arrival of ESBLs, detection and confirmation was considered very important, and the default position arose that the presence of an ESBL in a test clinical strain, whatever the MIC of the organism, required the reporting of the organism as resistant to cephalosporins of all types. Many susceptibility testing methods recommended the use of ESBL screening and confirmation tests on a routine basis. However, a number of issues have emerged routine use over the years: 1. The problem of defining an adequate number of substrates to ensure sufficiently sensitive screening. 2. The lack of simple and reliable phenotypic methods to detect ESBLs in species with inducible AmpC b-lactamases. 3. The failure of current ESBL detection methods to provide advice on the interpretation of a positive screening test but a negative confirmation test, especially if the isolates are \"susceptible\" to extended-spectrum cephalosporins using method-recommended breakpoints. 4. Animal model data showing that the response to treatment of ENTB (measured as in vivo killing) is correlated with the MIC of the strain, and not the presence or absence of an ESBL. A range of recent studies has suggested that failures of treatment with extended-spectrum cephalosporins are likely when strains of ENTB have MICs elevated above the wild-type. Further, application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles to the most widely recommended dosing schedules of cephalosporins have shown that the susceptibility breakpoints recommended by many methods have been too high. Lower breakpoints for injectable cephalosporins are now published by CLSI and EUCAST, with recommendations to optionally conduct specific ESBL tests, for instance if there is an epidemiological need. These newer cephalosporin breakpoints put us in a position where almost all ESBL-producing and plasmid-borne AmpC-producing ENTB will be detected and reported as I or R with the new breakpoints, and specific b-lactamase testing will not be required. This is appropriate for clinical reports whose major purpose is to guide therapy in individual patients.",

Proponents of this view contend that it is unnecessary for clinical laboratories to edit susceptibility data on the basis of resistance mechanisms and that these should only be sought, if at all, for purposes of epidemiological surveillance. Several outcome studies support this view (though others do not) and it would have great merit in a perfect world where routine MICs were rapidly and precisely determined for clinical isolates. The reality is very different. MICs, if measured at all in clinical laboratories, are determined, late, on a geometrical scale with four-fold run-to-run variation tolerated for control strains. Often zone diameters are used as a proxy for MICs and, as anyone who has ever run a multicentre discbased survey discovers, these are prone to disturbingly wide site-to-site variation. In this imperfect reality an ESBL producer with a cefotaxime MIC of 1 mg/L (probably responsive to cefotaxime in vivo) cannot be reliably distinguished from one with an MIC of 4 mg/L (probably not responsive) and it is simpler and safer to follow the precautionary approach of seeking the ESBL and, if this is found, reporting the isolate as resistant. A further advantage of seeking mechanisms is that \u2212 using selective primary culture media or chromogenic tests \u2212 they can be found by 24-h post specimen, as against 48-h for a precise MIC. This differential, which is only likely to increase with the coming of molecular methods to detect resistance mechanisms, may be critical, allowing the association between early effective therapy and reduced mortality in severely-ill patients. Objectives: As there exists still some concern about the potential relationship of Abacavir (ABC) and myocardial infarction (MI), and some authors has postulated that the increase in the risk of MI might be caused because of pro-inflammatory state, as increase and decrease of the risk follows quickly the start and resume of ABC, we decided to longitudinally evaluate Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), a widely accepted marker of vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease during ABC therapy in HIV patients due the lack of accuracy of other markers as IL6, IL8, hs-CRP or TNFalfa. Methods: Eleven consecutive HIV-positive patients starting ABCcontaining HAART were sampled at 0, 6 and 12 months after the start of ABC. Eleven HIV-positive patients on ABC sparing HAART were individually matched for other potential cardiovascular disease markers as hypertension, sex, age, smoking status, cholesterol and diabetes, and were sampled as controls.",

Objectives: Although there has been an increase in available antiretroviral for pretreated patients, their high cost and short time since approved make nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) to be the most widely used backbone. However, since pre treated patients usually harbored mutations in reverse transcriptase, frequently tenofovir (TDF) and abacavir (ABC) are the only NRTI available.

Methods: A single clinic retrospective study including all HIV-1 infected pretreated patients >18 years of age starting ABC-TDF irrespective of their prior HAART. The effectiveness was evaluated in an ITT analysis. Results: Forty-six patients, 31 men (67%) with a mean age of 43 years (28\u221265) and median CD4 cell count of 447 .

We performed QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube (QFT-G) in blood and CSF at all patients. Results: From a total of 46 children enrolled, 21 cases has been diagnosed with TB meningitis and 25 patient was in the control group; B:F = 18:10; mean of age was 9.75 (age range 6 months to 17 years). The symptoms and physical examination at the admission may suggest TB meningitis: fever, headache, vomiting and neck stiffness at 17 patients, cranial nerve palsies at 2 patients, hemi paresis at 3, altered mental status at 13 and seizures at 6 subjects. TST was positive at 13 patients in the first group and at 6 in the second. The CSF analyses were suggestive for TB at 16 patients: pleocytosis 300 elements/ml, high CSF protein level and low CSF glucose. All patients had negative smear and only 7 (33.3%) had positive culture. The mean time interval required for QFT-G results was 48 hours and for cultures was 25.6 days. In the first group, the results of QFT-G in blood samples were: 15 (71.4%) subjects had QFT-G positive, 5 (23.8%) had QFT-G negative and one indeterminate (4.7%). In CSF, 16 (76.2%) patients had positive results, 3 (14.3%) had negative and 2 (9.5%) indeterminate. In group of non TB meningitis, 23 (92%) patients had negative results in blood and 2 (8%) positive; in CSF, 19 (76%) subjects had negative results and 6 (24%) indeterminate. The sensitivity of QFT-G in CSF was 84.2% and 75% in blood; specificity 100% in CSF and 92% in blood; the positive predictive value of QFT-G was 100% in CSF and 88.2% in blood; negative predictive value was 86.3% in CSF and 82.1% in blood. The sensitivity of TST was 61.9% and specificity 76%. The sensitivity of the culture from CSF was only 33.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of QFT-G was higher than TST and culture and better in CSF than in blood.",

Objective: Treatment of latent tuberculosis (LTBI) in HIV+ patients reduces the incidence of TB. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) may be more specific in diagnosing LTBI than the tuberculin skin test, but their sensitivity at lower CD4 counts has not been established. We studied the effect of CD4 count on IGRA results. Methods: T-SPOT.TB \u00ae ELISPOT assays, incorporating ESAT-6 and CFP-10, and Quantiferon 3G \u00ae ELISA assays, incorporating ESAT-6, CFP-10 and TB7.7, were performed in HIV+ patients with CD4 counts <250\u00d710 6 /L (n = 72, median CD4 count = 124\u00d710 6 /L) and HIV+ controls with CD4 >250\u00d710 6 /L (n = 160, median CD4 count = 460\u00d710 6 /L). Active TB was excluded in all patients. ELISA and ELISPOT responses were related to patient characteristics. Results: ELISA responses were positive in 21% (n = 15) of patients with CD4 < 250\u00d710 6 /L and 31% (n = 49) of those with CD4 > 250\u00d710 6 /L, (difference of 10%, 95% CI \u22122-22%, p = 0.15). ELISPOT responses were positive among 8% (n = 5) of patients with CD4 < 250\u00d710 6 /L and 15% (n = 22) of those with CD4 >250\u00d710 6 /L, (difference of 7%, 95% CI \u22122-16%, p = 0.13). However; when multivariate regression analysis was used to adjust for LTBI risk factors such as origin from countries of high TB prevalence, ELISA and ELISPOT results were independent of CD4 count. Migration from countries with a high prevalence of TB (COHP) was associated with positive results on multivariate analysis: in those from COHP the OR for positive ELISA was 2.7 (95% CI 1.5\u22125), p = 0.03; and OR for positive ELISPOT was 4.0 (95% CI 1.6\u221210), p = 0.003. Injection drug use, incarceration and homelessness were not associated with positive results. Significantly, 17% (7/41) of individuals with no risk factor for LTBI had a positive ELISA, and 5% (2/41) had a positive ELISPOT. 30% (70/232) of patients had one or more positive IGRA result, of whom only 32% (21/70) were positive on both tests. Agreement between the two IGRAs was moderate, Cohen's kappa = 0.37. There was no association between inter-test agreement and CD4 count. Origin from a COHP was associated with a higher level of agreement between positive tests. Conclusions: ELISA and ELISPOT responses were independent of CD4 count. Disagreement between the tests is frequent, and not related to CD4 count. Discordant results are more common in patients with lower pretest probability of LTBI and, given the high rate of positive results in those with no risk factor for LTBI, may represent false positive results.",

IGRAs may also offer an attractive option for assisting in diagnosis of active TB. Several studies have been published comparing IGRAs with conventional diagnosis. As part of on-going assessment of TB diagnostic approaches we assessed the reliability of IGRA within our cohort at the regional Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit (TIDU Objectives: Reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is a major complication of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a treatment. Thus, screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is mandatory before starting anti-TNF therapy. The TST has 2 main disadvantages: the low specificity with false positive results in BCG vaccinated subjects and lower sensitivity in presence of immunosuppressive therapy resulting in false negative results. Diagnosis of LTBI may benefit from new interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA). The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) assay and its agreement with TST in the screening of LTBI in patients with an immune-mediated inflammatory diseases candidate for anti-TNF therapy. Methods: We consecutively enrolled 215 patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis (n = 77), psoriatic arthritis (n = 38), psoriasis (n = 64), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 8), Crohn's disease (n = 22), and Behcet's disease (n = 6) were enrolled. Screening included: clinical evaluation, chest X-ray, TST and QFT-GIT. 106 patients were on corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive drugs and 20 were BCG-vaccinated. Results: Of the 215 patients, 34 (15.8%) had a positive, 152 (70.6%) a negative, and 29 (13.4%) had an indeterminate QFT-GIT result. In 122 (65.5%) patients the TST and QFT-GIT were both negative, in 30 (16%) patients both the tests were positive, while 34 (18%) had discrepant results between TST and QFT-GIT. Agreement between two tests was 81.7% (k = 0.53). A diagnosis of LTBI was considered in 38 cases (17.6%). By univariate analysis, we observed an association between BCG vaccination and discordant QFT-GIT-/TST+ (OR = 6; 95% CI: 2.3-37.1; p < 0.001) and between the immunosuppressive therapy and an indeterminate QFT-GIT tests (OR = 2.79; 95% CI: 1.06\u22127.6; p < 0.02).",

The performance of QFT-GIT seems to not be affected by immunosuppression in our patients. IGRA appears to offer a better chance than TST for monitoring TB infection during anti-TNF-a therapy. Objectives: Genotypic detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) resistance to antivirals is based on thymidine kinase (UL23) and DNA polymerase (UL30) gene sequencing. The interpretation of results requires distinguishing resistance mutations from natural interstrain sequence variations. The objective of this work was to assess extensively the natural polymorphism of pUL23 and pUL30 among HSV strains. Methods: Three laboratory strains (KOS, G-HSV-2, MH2) and 54 clinical isolates (27 HSV-1 and 27 HSV-2) were studied. Forty strains were collected from patients who had not received any previous anti-HSV treatment, and 14 strains exhibited acyclovir and foscarnet phenotypic susceptibility using a plaque reduction assay. The entire open reading frame of UL23 and UL30 genes was sequenced. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with that of reference strains from Genbank: accession numbers X14112 (HSV-1 strain 17) and Z86099 (HSV2 strain HG52). Results: The interstrain identity of UL23 gene ranged from 99.3% to 100% at the nucleotide level in the 57 HSV strains investigated. There were 19 and 11 variant nucleotides for HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains, respectively. Overall, 19 amino acid changes were identified for HSV-1 strains and 7 amino acid changes for HSV-2 strains (that is, 5.1% and 1.9% of the total codons of the protein, respectively). The analysis of UL30 gene showed >99.5% interstrain identity among all HSV strains. Surprisingly, in HSV-1 strains, 113 variant nucleotides were evidenced, of which 72% produced silent mutations, whereas in HSV-2 strains, only 28 were evidenced, of which 32% produced silent mutations. Thirty and 18 amino acid changes distributed across UL30 DNA polymerase were described for HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains, respectively, corresponding to 2.4% and 1.3% of the total codons of the protein. Of note, one HSV-2 isolate harboured a deletion at codons 1106-1111 in the C-terminal region of pUL30. For both viral proteins, 71 out of 74 amino acid changes identified lied within nonconserved regions.",

Kearns\u00b0, M. Ganner, I. McCormick Smith, C. Perry, B.D. Cookson, M.J. Ellington (London, UK) Objectives: Whilst the role of PVL in staphylococcal disease remains contentious, the association of PVL-positive S. aureus (PVL-SA) with recurrent skin and soft tissue infections is compelling. Following the introduction of initiatives for enhanced ascertainment of PVLrelated disease in England, we sought to investigate the clinical and epidemiological features of pyogenic skin infections cause by PVLpositive versus PVL-negative S. aureus. Methods: Isolates of S. aureus submitted referred to the national Staphylococcus Reference Unit (SRU) recovered from pyogenic skin infections (boils, abscesses, carbuncles etc) from patients throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland during 2008 were included for study. Isolates were characterised by toxin gene profiling (including PVL), mecA testing and DNA fingerprinting by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Patient demographic data and clinical features including the site of the lesion(s) and recurrence of infection were analysed. Results: During 2008, a total of 1230 isolates of S. aureus from pyogenic skin infections were submitted to the SRU for characterisation. Of these, 835 were MSSA and 395 were MRSA (68 and 32% respectively). Patients were aged 0 to 95y (median 30y); the male:female ratio was 1:1. A total of 800 (65%) isolates were PVL-positive; the majority of which (523; 65%) were MSSA. Comparison of cases according to PVL status showed PVL-SA were recovered from younger cohorts (median 26y) and were commonly associated with buttock, thigh and/or axilla lesions (50% cases). In contrast, PVL-negative SA were associated with older individuals (median 38y) with lesions from a wide range of body sites, the commonest sites being breast or back (11% each). Recurrent infections were more apparent among the PVL group (30 vs 20% cases). A multiplicity of strains/lineages was identified. Of 10 different clones of PVL-MRSA identified, 3 lineages (USA300, European and South West Pacific clones) predominated. Conclusion: PVL-SA from pyogenic skin infections predominantly occurred in younger individuals, most commonly affecting the buttocks and/or axillae; a third of infections were recurrent. These data have important implications for recognising, diagnosing and managing such infections in the community. O343 Concomitant prevalence of community-and healthcareassociated MRSA among residents and staff of long-term care facilities in northern Israel M.J. Schwaber\u00b0, S. Masarwa, S. Navon-Venezia, Y. Kandlik, I. Chmelnitsky, G. Smollan, R. Glick, G. Neria, Y. Carmeli (Tel Aviv, Safed, IL) Background: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are important reservoirs of MRSA. We determined the prevalence and molecular characteristics of MRSA among residents and staff of LTCFs in northern Israel. Methods: Nasal swabs were obtained from residents and staff at 6 LTCFs during February-May 2009. MRSA was identified via growth on CHROMagar\u2122 MRSA plates, and coagulase production. Definitive identification and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by VITEK \u00ae 2. Genetic relatedness of strains was determined by spa-typing, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). SCCmec typing was performed via multiplex PCR, and the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) gene was tested for by PCR. Results: A total of 191 residents (30% male, median age 85) and 132 staff members (20% male, median age 49) were screened. MRSA was isolated in 14% of residents and in 11% of staff members. The major MRSA strain carried among residents (24/27 isolates, 89%) in 5 of the 6 institutions was a healthcare-associated (HA-) MRSA strain: ST5, t002, SCCmec type II. This HA-MRSA strain was also carried among staff (5/14 isolates, 36%) in 2 of these institutions. HA-MRSA (ST5, t002, un-typable SCCmec) was found as well among staff (2/14 isolates, 14%) in an additional institution in which no residents were MRSA carriers. An additional MRSA strain prevalent among staff (3 institutions, 6/14 isolates, 43%) was a community-associated (CA-) MRSA strain: ST8, t008, with an un-typable SCCmec in 5 of 6 isolates grown. This CA-MRSA strain was detected in only one resident (1/27 isolates, 4%), from an institution in which this strain was found among 4 of its staff members (Table) . All MRSA isolates lacked the pvl gene. Conclusions: MRSA is highly prevalent among residents and staff in LTCFs in northern Israel. Contrary to a priori assumptions, molecular analysis revealed little connection between MRSA among staff and that among residents, arguing against transmission between them. The MRSA strain ST8, t008, with a CA-MRSA phenotype, was prevalent among staff but rare among patients. Two grams of soil/compost were suspended in 5 ml 0.2 M NaCl-1% Tween and 100 ml plated on Sabouraud agar and 50 ml on each of 4 RPMI-1640\u22122% glucose agars containing itraconazole (4 mg/l), voriconazole (1 mg/l), posaconazole (0.5 mg/l) and no antifungal, respectively, and incubated at 37\u00baC. Identification of aspergilli was based on standard micro-and macro-morphological criteria. Aspergillus isolates which grew on the azole containing agars underwent susceptibility testing using EUCAST E.DEF 9.1 microdilution method for itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole and b-tubulin sequencing unless they were able to grow at 48\u00baC. The promoter and entire coding sequence of the cyp51A gene were sequenced for azole resistant isolates. Objectives: The emergence of multi-drug resistant Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) causing invasive aspergillosis has raised the question of whether the evolution of azole-resistance has an impact on virulence and therefore on clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to determine whether acquired azole resistance in fungi through mutations in CYP51A or other unknown genes comes with a cost in fitness.",

In vitro growth rates were determined using a previously -Ollivier AAC 2008, 52:3092) , were analyzed by sequencing the hotspot regions of the FKS genes. Initial isolates were also analyzed when available and serial isolates were genotyped using polymorphic microsatellite markers. All medical charts of patients harbouring such isolates were reviewed. Results: For the 14 episodes involving isolates with reduced susceptibility to caspofungin, patients (sex ratio M:F = 10:4, mean age: 44y) were diagnosed with candidemia (n = 8), other invasive infections (n = 4) and oropharyngeal candidiasis (n = 2). Underlying diseases were hematological malignancies (n = 6), solid organ transplant (n = 2), HIV infection (n = 1), and other conditions (n = 5). Candida species were 7 C. albicans, 6 C. glabrata, and 1 C. krusei. All 14 isolates have been recovered after the patient was treated with caspofungin for a duration ranging from 10 days to several months. All had mutation in FKS genes. Among 10 patients for whom a previous isolate was available, paired isolates shared identical genotypes. Furthermore, for each pair, the isolate recovered before caspofungin treatment had higher susceptibility (MIC < 0.25 mg/ml) to caspofungin than the second ones, and had wild-type FKS genes. Conclusions: Caspofungin resistance in Candida spp. was always associated with prior exposure to the drug in severely ill patients. Further analysis should uncover if other factors such as treatment's duration influence its occurrence. Invasive infections due to various species of Candida spp. with acquired reduced susceptibility to caspofungin deserve attention.",

Simons (Maastricht, Utrecht, Nijmegen, NL) Objective: Candida yeasts are the fourth most common source of nosocomial bloodstream infections. Especially during the last decade, the prevalence of opportunistic Candida infections has increased and has become a serious threat to high risk patients. To date, most molecular diagnostic tools are based on ribosomal regions. Although broadly applied, these target genes have difficulties discriminating closely related species, causing misidentification and underestimation of polymicrobial infections. This results in an urgent need of high discriminatory and accurate detection methods for clinical purposes using novel probes. The aim of this project is to improve molecular diagnostics of yeastrelated infections. Methods: A novel DNA based diagnostic system using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technology serves as our platform for molecular diagnostics using newly developed diagnostic probes. A Candida-MLPA assay containing probes for C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, and C. lusitaniae has been developed. Results: The specificity of the assay was validated on 50 Candida/non-Candida spp. from CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre. In addition, 95 clinical isolates were screened with the MLPA assay and the results were compared with AFLP profiles. In case of any discordance the identity of the strain was established by sequencing the ITS region. Furthermore, the total screening encompassed phylogenetically related species, including 31 Candida spp., 4 Pichia spp. and S. cerevisiae. The Candida-MLPA assay showed a 100% concordance with the ITS sequences. The analytical sensitivity of the Candida-MLPA assay was established on 100 fg gDNA, which represents less than two yeast cells. Conclusions: We demonstrated that an assay based upon the MLPA technology was able to identify 8 Candida spp. in one reaction. Multiple infections, up to 7 species in one sample, could be identified. Due to the nature of the MLPA technology highly complex assays are possible providing room for additional probes like a generic Candida probe or probes for other emerging species. The specificity and sensitivity of this multiparameter assay shows great potential for a fast and comprehensive screening approach for clinically relevant Candida spp. in a diagnostic setting.",

Trimmed sequences were then aligned with sequences in the NCBI nr/nt database using BLAST. Filamentous fungi and yeast from 33 genera and 55 species were included in the study. Results: For 64 of the 133 isolates sequenced, the morphological identification matched the sequence based identification. Morphologic and sequence based identification were disparate in 38 cases. For 31 of the isolates, the sequence-based identification was equivocal; that is, the morphologic identification was found in the top ten \"hits\" in the sequence database, but the morphologic identification was not the first choice or there were other choices that were equal probability matches. Sequence identification performed well for most yeast species, and for some filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus, Scedosporium and Fusarium spp. Sequence identification was not as accurate for identification of dermatophytes, Zygomycetes, and dematiaceous moulds. Conclusions: Use of the NCBI sequence database for identification of clinical isolates of fungi may result in incorrect identification and administration of appropriate antifungal therapy.

            "text": "With a declining arsenal of antibiotics to treat infections, it was increasingly clear that the traditional orientation toward control of HAIs (hospital acquired infections) needed to shift to one where preventing the occurrence was the priority throughout the institution. There has to be a global capacity for the political, financial, managerial, and technical support needed for worldwide initiatives. These considerations were all addressed when diseases like smallpox, polio, measles, dracunculiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, Chagas disease, and Hansen disease were targeted for eradication. This model doesn't exactly work for HAIs, because we deal with many different organisms and types of infections, humans are not the only reservoir, many of the organisms are normal flora, and relatively limited scientific and operational resources have actually been dedicated to preventing HAIs. New technologies and procedures, more virulent pathogens and increasing resistance will continue to challenge the healthcare community in its efforts reduce HAIs. If one looks theoretically at all of the infections that occur, one could divide them up into two main groups; some that are preventable and some that are not. The ones that are preventable are preventable through the implementation of practices, behaviors and procedures, and following a very strict clinical pathway. Others are not probably preventable, and that is the irreducible amount. The 'getting to zero' movement is the product of three forces: the expansion of external pressures on infection control programs, the intrusion of suboptimal evidence, and the convergence of quality improvement and infection control. The 'zero' obsession has a number of worrisome, unintended consequences. It sets up unrealistic expectations on the part of the public and healthcare administrators, leading to unreasonable demands on infection control programs. It fosters a punitive culture, since someone must be at fault for causing infections. It separates infection control from safety and quality, when infection control concerns trump other important safety issues. It has shifted the development of interventions away from an approach based on local risk assessment to the promotion of a one-size-fits-all approach. Healthcare workers and hospital epidemiologists have become demoralized when the expectations for getting to zero persist but the elusive zero has not been attained. The concept of \"targeting zero HAIs\" is controversial, because many people believe it sets unrealistic or impossible expectations that all HAIs are preventable and that any HAI that may occur was due to an error or a broken process. Targeting 'zero' is problematic, because it does not address the variation in the risk of HAIs in different patient populations or settings, it does not address the denominator or time frame that is necessary to understand rates of infection, and it inherently seems scientifically unrealistic.",

We have evidence demonstrating that influenzavirus genes migrate across continents and animal species, and assemble themselves in combinations which are a threat to animal and human health, resulting in panzootics like H5N1 or pandemics like H1N1 2009. The latter contains a unique combination of genes from three species and two hemispheres. In a globalized environment, mapping gene movement across species and national borders and identifying mutations and gene constellations with pandemic potential or virulence determinants is essential to enact prevention and control strategies at a global level. This is in line with, and possibly the best example of, the 'One Health' vision: a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to improve the health of humans, animals and the environment endorsed by the UN Food & Agriculture Organisation, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organisation. Vast improvements in capacity building have been achieved as a result of the H5N1 global crisis. Thousands of viral isolates with zoonotic potential have been obtained through surveillance efforts, although the genetic information has not been exploited fully. In addition, the circulation of influenzaviruses in certain species including dogs, pigs and horses has been neglected. Time has come to invest in a novel approach to influenzavirus infections, abandoning prefixed compartments linked to geographical origin or species of isolation, and analyse the influenza gene pool as one entity. We propose capitalising on existing achievements and investments to develop an international network and a permanent observatory which will improve our understanding of the dynamics of the influenzavirus gene pool in animals and humans. This will generate essential information to support both public and animal health. The \"One Flu\" initiative would result in international synergies, bridging gaps between medical and veterinary scientists, permanent monitoring of virus evolution and epidemiology and the best exploitation of investments in capacity building. Above all it could be a challenge and opportunity to implement the \"One Health\" vision, and possibly act as a model for other emerging zoonotic diseases. ",

Results: MICs for isolates with KPC carbapenemases were from 16\u221264 mg/L (geom. mean 40 mg/L) and introduction of a KPC+ plasmid into E. coli only raised the MIC from 8 to 16 mg/L; by contrast MICs for isolates with metallo-b-lactamases were >128 mg/L in 22/36 cases, and introduction of plasmids coding NDN carbapenemase (the commonest MBL in the UK) into E. coli DH5a raised the temocillin MIC from 4 to >64 mg/L.

We describe 3 cases of IFI with H. aspergillata occurring within one year on the hematological ward at the University Hospital Basel. Methods: Patients were hospitalized in single rooms with special highefficiency particle air filters. Surveillance fungal cultures of air filters were carried out regularly. No primary mold prophylaxis was performed. Screening for mold infections was performed by twice weekly measuring serum galactomannan and weekly pulmonary CT scans. Sabouraud agar was inoculated for fungal cultures. The identification of H. aspergillata by culture was molecularly confirmed. Susceptibility testing was performed by Etest. O365 How to improve microbial documentation in febrile neutropenia? Impact of implementing an automat in the ward and addition of DNaemia detection C. Pautas\u00b0, Y. Hicheri, S. Bastuji-Garin, C. Corbel, S. Bretagne, L. Gregoire, E. Sbidian, S. Maury, C. Cordonnier, E. Cambau (Creteil, Paris, FR) Objectives: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is the most frequent complication of high-dose chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Only 30% of FN episodes are microbiologically documented by routine procedures, mainly by blood cultures (BC). We wondered whether shortening the time before incubation could improve this figure. In addition, we searched microbial DNA by the Septifast \u00ae test. Methods: Adult patients were eligible at their 1st FN episode if they were neutropenic (PMN < 0.5\u00d710 9 /L), febrile ( 38\u00ba3 or twice 38\u00ba within 8 h), and had a central venous catheter (CVC). At onset of fever, we collected 4 BC bottles (2 aerobic and 2 anaerobic)sampled through the CVC. They were immediately incubated in the ward (BacT/Alert3D \u00ae ). Septifast was performed on 1.5 ml of blood sampled at the same time. In parallel, 2 standard BCs (1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic bottles) were routinely sampled (1 CVC and 1 peripheral) and sent to the laboratory for incubation. Each patient was assessed for microbial documentation in the blood, either BC positivity or DNA detection; and the time elapsed between blood sampling and documentation, when this latter was positive. Pairwise analyses were performed using the McNemar test for documentation rate and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for times for positivity. Results: 120 consecutive FN episodes were included from Feb 2008 to Mar 2009: 97 (80%) acute leukemia/myelodysplasia, 26 (17%) lymphoid malignancies and 4 (3%) others with 18 (15%) episodes in allogeneic and 16 (13%) in autologous stem cell transplantation. The rate of BC positivity was 30% (36 episodes) in the study process and 28.3% (34 episodes) in the routine process (McNemar's c 2 = 0.67, p = 0.41). In the microbiologically documented episodes, the time elapsed between incubation and positivity was significantly shorter for the BC bottles incubated in the ward (median rank: 12 h25 min [7 h55\u221225 h37]) than for the routine BC bottles (median rank: 13 h03 min [9 h31\u221243 h33]) (p = 0.002). The Septifast test was positive in 9 episodes (7.5%) that were positive also by the BC testing. In 8 additional episodes, the Septifast \u00ae test showed low DNA content out of the threshold, which was nevertheless concordant with positives BCs. Conclusion: Immediate incubation of blood cultures in the ward and detection of DNaemia with the Septifast test did not improve the rate of microbial documentation for FN episodes when compared to BC routine process. However, it reduced the time to positivity.",

The mean age was 58.8 years (from 20 to 85) without differences in distribution by genders. The prevalence of infection was 0.5 cases per 100.000 inhabitants year. Seventy per cent of patients had a chronic underlying disease: cirrhosis of the liver (30%), hematologic neoplasms (25%), chronic debilitating conditions (23%), collagen vascular disease (13%) and solid neoplasms (11%) were the most common underlying conditions. Only 1 pregnant woman was seen. Primary bacteremia (56%) and meningoencephalitis (44%) were the most common presentations. In addition, 10 patients developed focal infecci\u00f3n such as bacterial peritonitis (4), endocarditis (3) and brain abscesses (3). Although most infections were communityacquired, 17 episodes (26%) developed within the hospital after more than 72 h of admission. Nosocomial outbreaks were not detected. Ampicillin (34%) alone or in combination with gentamicin (44%) and cotrimoxazol (16%) were the antimicrobial regimens most frequently used. We did not find differences in the mortality rate among patients on monotherapy (32%) and combined therapy (35%). Cotrimoxazol was successfully used in 9 out of 10 patients treated. Nineteen patients (39%) died within 30-days of diagnosis. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with hematologic or solid neoplasms than in those with cirrhosis or other underlying debilitating disorders (64% vs 36%, p < 0.05). All the patients without comorbidities survived the infection. Conclusions: Human listeriosis is a severe disease still producing high mortality particularly in immunocompromised hosts with hematologic and solid neoplasms and other debilitating conditions. Despite synergistic in vitro activity, the combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin did not determined survival benefits. Cotrimoxazol may be a useful alternative for the antimicrobial therapy of human listeriosis. Taiwan , and cellulitis (4.1%). The mean Pitts bacteremic score was 1.58 (range from score 0 to score 9).

Fungal culture: The cerebral fungal burden declined over time in all animals including untreated ones. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between controls and treated animals. 3. GM: GM peaked later than the CFU counts in all treatment groups except L-AmB. There were no significant differences in GM indices regarding treatment and time. 4. Cytokines: At 2d after infection both IFN-g and TNF-a [Fig. B ] levels were significantly higher in animals treated with L-AmB alone (135.8\u00b193.9pg/mg and 25.8\u00b122.2pg/mg) compared to CAS (24.1\u00b120.8pg/mg and 6.3\u00b18.4pg/mg; p < 0.001), and VCZ (13.8\u00b18.0pg/mg and 2.0\u00b11.9pg/mg; p < 0.001). No differences were found for IL-1a and IL-10. IL-6 was undetectable in most animals but elevated in severe disease. Conclusion: In this lethal model of cerebral aspergillosis mortality is not determined by the antifungal drug's effect on cerebral fungal burden but by its modulation of the host's immune response. Treatment groups consisted of 10 mice. The test groups were treated with clavulanate (100 mg/kg) alone, imipenem (100 mg/kg) and meropenem (100 mg/kg) alone or combined with clavulanate whereas a positive control group was treated with isoniazid (25 mg/kg) and a negative control group was held without treatment. At the end of treatment, surviving mice were sacrificed and lungs harvested. Treatment efficacy was assessed on survival rate, spleen weights and lung CFU counts. Results: at the end of the 4 weeks, the mortality rates were the following: untreated 60%, isoniazid 0%, clavulanate 30%, imipenem 10%, meropenem 30%, imipenem+clavulanate 0%, meropenem+clavulanate 0%. The combination of imipenem or meropenem plus clavulanate significantly improved survival (p = 0.01 vs untreated mice). On the other hand, imipenem and meropenem combined with clavulanate did not prevent splenomegaly (591 and 573 mg) whereas isoniazid did (304 mg) (p > 0.05). Among groups of mice with 100% survival, only isoniazid reduced lung CFU counts (\u22121.2 log 10 CFU vs D0), the penem+clavulanate combinations did not prevent bacterial growth (+0.9 to 1.4 log 10 CFU vs D0). Conclusion: although less active than isoniazid, the combinations of imipenem or meropenem and clavulanate improve survival of mice infected with M. tuberculosis and should be further evaluated.",

The colonising ability was tested by colonisation of the large intestine of streptomycin treated mice. Different colonisation, competition and inoculation procedures were tested in this model. Results: Both IBD strains had increased growth rate compared to the E. coli from the healthy person and the E. coli Nissle strain. Likewise, the IBD strains had an increased adhesion capacity in the cell adhesion assay. In the animal model all strains were able to colonise the gastrointestinal tract in high levels when inoculated alone. In competition with the probiotic Nissle strain both IBD strains co-colonised, though to a log higher (in CFU/g faeces) than Nissle, when inoculated in equal high levels. When E. coli Nissle was inoculated in high levels compared to IBD strain in low levels the strains also co-colonised at the end of the experiment. The E. coli strain from the healthy person also co-colonised with E. coli Nissle in intestine of the mice, but stabilised at a log lower than Nissle strain, when inoculated in equal high levels and two logs lower when inoculated at a lower level than E. coli Nissle. Conclusion: IBD strains had increased growth rates and adhesion abilities compared to E. coli isolated from a healthy person and E. coli Nissle.

In vivo efficacy was evaluated against a CTX-M-15-like-producing E. coli strain using a lethal peritonitis sepsis model in neutropenic ICR mice. Survival was monitored for seven days after infection. E. coli inocula ranged from 2.5\u00d710 6 to 5.0\u00d710 6 cfu/mouse (2\u22125 X LD50) and BAL30072 was administered intraperitoneally 3 times daily for 3 days (doses of 100 mg/kg down to 12.5 mg/kg) following infection. Saline was administered to the untreated control group and meropenem was administered to the treated control group. Results: MIC50/MIC90 of BAL30072 for wild type, and ESBLproducing E. coli were 0.125/0.5, and <0.0625/1 mg/L, respectively (ranges <0.0625\u22121 and <0.0625-256 mg/L, respectively). The MIC of BAL30072 against the ESBL-E. coli used in the mouse model was <0.0625 mg/L. In vivo experiments in mice infected intraperitoneally with various E. coli inocula showed that, at doses from 100 mg/kg down to 12.5 mg/kg, BAL30072 conferred protection similar to meropenem (90-100% survival). Survival in the placebo group was 0\u221233%. Conclusion: BAL30072 is an effective antibacterial agent against clinical isolates of E. coli, including ESBL-producing strains.

The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of novel antimicrobial agent (NI02) against a range of pathogenic bacteria and against a clinical isolate Staphylococcus epidermidis that displays methicillin resistance and a biofilm phenotype. Methods: The deferred antagonism method was used to assess the range of activity of NI02 against a selection of pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

MBL producers commonly exhibit resistance not only to a broad-spectrum of b-lactams but also to a variety of non-b-lactam agents owing to association of MBL genes with those affecting different groups of antibiotics. The IMP and VIM enzymes are the most common acquired MBLs. These enzymes were first reported in Japan and Europe but are now broadly disseminated in many countries of all populated continents. Production of acquired MBLs is most often observed in P. aeruginosa, with VIM-2 being the most ubiquitous enzyme, and less frequently in Acinetobacter spp. and in Enterobacteriaceae, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae, with VIM-1 or VIM-4 being the most typical variants in the latter species. MBLs of other genetic groups were either identified in isolates causing sporadic infections and local outbreaks (e.g. GIM-1, SIM-1, KHM-1, AIM-1) or as endemic types in some geographic areas (e.g. SPM-1 in Latin America). However, the recent reports of the international importation of SPM-1 from Brazil to Switzerland and of NDM-1 from India to the UK provide continuing evidence of the increasing complexity of MBL epidemiology. The prevalence of MBL-producers varies significantly among different countries and their epidemiology now ranges from sporadic monoclonal outbreaks to polyclonal endemicity. Furthermore, MBL-producing strains are no longer confined to nosocomial environment but are being identified also in residents of long-term-care facilities and even in patients with community-acquired infections. The association of MBL genes with mobile genetic platforms (e.g. Tn402-like transposons in the case of blaVIM genes), broad host range plasmids and highly epidemic clones (e.g. P. aeruginosa clonal complexes CC235 and CC111) were apparently implicated in the rapid spread of these important resistance determinants.",

            "text": "Class D b-lactamase-mediated resistance to b-lactams has been increasingly reported during the last decade. Those enzymes also known as oxacillinases or OXAs are widely distributed among Gram negatives. They do usually possess a narrow spectrum b-lactam hydrolysis profile, but some of them do possess the ability to hydrolyse carbapenems, even at a low level. They have been named Carbapenem-Hydrolysing class D b-Lactamases, or CHDLs. CHDLs are known to be intrinsic in some Gram negative rods, including Acinetobacter baumannii (OXA-51-like enzymes) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OXA-50-like enzymes), but usually play a minor role in the natural resistance phenotypes. Besides those naturally-occurring CHDLs, others have been identified as acquired. They have been mostly identified in Acinetobacter spp. (mostly in A. baumannii), and belong to four distinct groups according to their amino acid sequences, namely the OXA-23, OXA-40, OXA-58, and OXA-143 groups. The genes encoding those CHDLs in A. baumannii are either plasmid-or chromosome-encoded. Interestingly, the blaOXA-23 progenitor was shown to be Acinetobacter radioresistens, a nonpathogenic and environmental species. Despite their weak ability to hydrolyse carbapenems, those CHDLs are responsible for high level resistance to those compounds when their expression is associated with other mechanisms such as efflux overepression, penicillin-binding protein modifications, or porin loss. Another CHDL, OXA-48, distantly related from those CHDLs identified in A. baumannii, has been identified in several enterobacterial species, and mostly in Klebsiella pneumoniae. The blaOXA-48 gene which has been found to originate from Shewanella spp. is plasmid-mediated, increasingly reported in different countries, and responsible for resistance to carbapenems when associated with permeability deffects. Acquired CHDL encoding genes have been mostly identified in association with insertion sequences that are either responsible for their expression and their acquisition. In particular, both the blaOXA-48 and blaOXA-23 genes have been identified inside composite integron structures (IS1999-and ISAba1-made, respectively).",

As with other Gram-negative species, carbapenem resistance has been attributed to multiple mechanisms, including reduced permeability through loss of outer membrane proteins, altered penicillin-binding proteins and overexpression of weakly carbapenem-hydrolyzing b-lactamases, but the major mechanism is carbapenemase production. Diverse carbapenemases have been reported in A. baumannii, differing in their regional prevalence: isolates with IMP or VIM metallo-enzymes are globally scattered; those with SIM-1 are associated particularly with the Far East, while NDM-1 has been observed only rarely. OXA class D enzymes are the dominant carbapenemases in A. baumannii, with 5 phylogenetically distinct groups identified. OXA-51-like enzymes are intrinsic to the species, and are only associated with carbapenem resistance when up-regulated by an adjacent insertion sequence, usually ISAba1. By contrast, OXA-23-like, OXA-40-like, OXA-58-like and OXA-143 carbapenemases have all been acquired via horizontal gene spread. These enzymes usually confer clinically significant carbapenem resistance, although the MICs for individual isolates are influenced by the particular gene present, its copy number, and presence of accessory mechanisms (e.g. loss of the CarO porin). The blaOXA genes may be located on the chromosome, as part of large resistance islands, or on plasmids. Local outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii typically include a predominant strain, and strains from epidemiologically unlinked sites may show sufficient similarity to be regarded as the same clone. There are two dominant carbapenemresistant clones in the UK, 'OXA-23 clone 1' has OXA-23 enzyme, and the 'South-east clone' has ISAba1-up-regulated OXA-83 enzyme; both have affected >50 hospitals and belong to sequence group 1 (based on ompA, csuE and blaOXA-51-like alleles), which is European clone II. In other countries there may be greater evidence for horizontal gene spread in addition to strain spread, as observed for OXA-72 (an OXA-40-like enzyme) in a Taiwanese hospital. There are few therapeutic options for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant strains other than a polymyxin or glycylcycline and effective infection control remains essential to control their spread and impact.",

The advent of new, more accurate markers of infection presents an opportunity to re-evaluate our conventional understanding of the host-pathogen relationship in tuberculosis, including the natural history and epidemiology of tuberculosis infection. The application of interferon-gamma release assays in epidemiologically well-defined tuberculosis outbreaks and longitudinal cohorts points towards a new class of host-pathogen interaction in a subset of tuberculosis contacts that likely involves a transient, self-resolving infection. This entity was not previously appreciated and has significant implications for our understanding of the host-pathogen interaction in tuberculosis infection which will be discussed. T cell-based testing for tuberculosis infection has also uncovered a role for BCG vaccine in preventing infection despite M. tuberculosis exposure. The implications of this phenomenon for the design and evaluation of new tuberculosis vaccines, as well from tuberculosis control, will be discussed. Newer biomarkers, measuring multiple facets of the host response to tuberculosis infection and disease, have recently been developed and may enable discrimination between the several stages in the natural history of tuberculosis infection, eg differentiating between active and latent tuberculosis infection. These new types of biomarkers will be reviewed as well as the the new insights they could provide for our understanding of the host-pathogen equilibrium in tuberculosis infection.",

Using genetics and biochemistry, we identified the enzyme decaprenylphosphoryl-b-D-ribose 2'-epimerase as a major BTZ target.

While case reports have identified many important problems, they have drawbacks, including unknown sensitivity for detecting events of interest and inability to provide the quantitative estimates of risk that are needed to make informed decisions about the balance of benefits and risk. Quantitative information about risks and also about benefits is becoming increasingly available through the secondary use of electronic health data \u2212 both electronic medical records and administrative data \u2212 collected during the routine delivery of health care. Among the earliest examples is the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's Vaccine Safety Datalink, which performs both active, near real-time, surveillance for vaccine-associated adverse events, and retrospective epidemiological studies. These methods are being modified to work in groups of health plans with tens of millions of members, and to address the sequelae of exposures to drugs as well as vaccines. An important feature of these methods is that they require minimal sharing of confidential personal information, because there is no need to create large pooled datasets in order to identify signals of adverse events. The presentation will illustrate these issues using the current experience evaluating the safety of the H1N1 influenza vaccine and others. It will also address the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's plan to create a Sentinel Network, which will use information from electronic medical records covering 100 million people to perform routine safety evaluation of marketed medical products.

Higher troughs are needed in order to achieve a higher AUC/MIC ratio which is thought to be important for serious infections like complicated bacteremia, infective endocarditis and pneumonia. Additional factors that affect antibiotic performance include the ability to reach the site of infection (barriers to penetration) and conditions at the site of infection such as pH, protein binding and inoculum.

Methods: Between October 2007 and June 2009 blood cultures were collected from children admitted to the Agogo Presbytarian Hospital located in the rural area of the Ashanti \u2212 Akim North District with a population of about 135,000. Peds Plus\u2122 bottles and the BacTec\u2122 9050 system were used and detected strains were identified by Gram staining, selective subcultures, biochemical testing and specific agglutination tests. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of isolated Enterobacteriaceae and production of extended-spectrum-b-lactamases (ESBL) was determined by the Etest\u2122 method. Results: In this study isolated Enterobacteriaceae (n = 178) were nontyphoid Salmonella enterica (NTS) (113), Salmonella Typhi (39), Escherichia coli (15) Klebsiella sp. (9), Shigella boydii (1) and Enterobacter sp. (1) . NTS were highly resistant to ampicillin (80.5%), cotrimoxazole (82.3%), chloramphenicol (83.2%), and tetracycline (10.6%). No strain was resistant to ciprofloxacin, but one strain had reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone. The majority of S. Typhi strains were also resistant to ampicillin (69.2%), cotrimoxazole (60.0%), chloramphenicol (66.7%), and tetracycline (60.0%), but all were completely susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. All E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin and 20% produced ESBL. Resistance to cotrimoxacole (93.3%), tetracycline (86.7%), chloramphenicol (53.3%) and ciprofloxacin (26.7%) was frequently detected. All Klebsiella strains were resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline and 77.8% produced ESBL. Only one strain was susceptible to cotrimoxazole, 77.8% were resistant to chloramphenicol and one third to ciprofloxacin. The Enterobacter strain procuced ESBL and was only susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The Shigella boydii isolate was susceptible to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. Conclusion: The study indicates that the majority of Enterobacteriaceae causing bacteraemia in children in the study area are resistant to the majority of local available antibiotics. Moreover this massive emergence of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and ESBL producing E. coli and Klebsiella strains in clinical isolates indicates a serious medical and economic burden for African healthcare systems.

Pascual (Seville, ES) Objectives: The means of transmission of ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBLEC) isolates in the community are poorly understood. We previously reported that the prevalence of faecal carriage with ESBLEC was higher in relatives of patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by these organisms.in 54 households The aim of this study was to analyse the molecular relationship of the ESBLEC within families settings and the plasmids identified. Methods: We studied 72 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates (34 CTX-M-14, 31 SHV-12, 3 CTX-M-9, 3 CTX-M-15 and 1 CTX-M-32) from 19 families of patients with UTI caused by ESBLEC where at least other faecal carrier within the family was identified (19 patients with UTI and 23 relatives). All isolates were evaluated by XbaI PFGE; the molecular the relatedness was determined by the UPG method using the Dice similarity index on Fingerprinting 3.0. Phylogenetic groups were assigned by multiplex PCR. Transfers of bla genes were carried out by conjugations experiments and transformation by electroporation into J53 and DH10 E. coli, respectively. Plasmids were compared by size using S1 nuclease digestion and by the patterns resulted of southern hybridation of HindIII-digested plasmid DNAs from transformants or transconjugants. Results: A total of 44 different PFGE patterns were identified distributed among phylogenetic groups A (23%), B1 (34%), D (32%) and B2 (11%). Nine relatives (39%) from 7 families (37%) carried the same pulsotype and ESBL than the patient with UTI in their family. In 10 families (53%), the isolates from different members yielded different pulsotypes harbouring the same enzyme; among them, the ESBL was located in similar RFLP plasmidic patterns in 5 families (3 with CTX-M14 and 2 with SHV-12). The CTX-M14 bla gene hybridazed with a single 20 kb hybridation band in 9 plasmids, whereas SHV-12 bla gene was located in fragments with different sizes in 13 plasmids. Conclusions: Common source or horizontal transmission of the same ESBL-producing strain or plasmid was found in 63% of the families with ESBL-producers carriers. The acquisition of different clones producing different ESBL enzymes by members of the same household was less frequent in our study, but denote other routes of spread in the community. Results: Of 262 enrolled persons, 231 submitted faecal samples and questionnaires before and after travel and were included for analysis. Before and after travel, 9 (4%) and 73 (32%) persons were colonised by ESBL-PE, respectively. No KPC were found. E. coli was the most commonly found species. Gender, age, use of oral cholera vaccination or antibiotics and duration of travel were similar among persons acquiring ESBL-PE during travel (travel associated (TA)-carriers, n = 69) and persons never colonised by ESBL-PE (non-carriers, n = 154). TA-carriers more often reported diahorrea (54%) or other abdominal symptoms (25%) during travel, compared to non-carriers (38% and 13%). Business was a more common cause for travelling among TA-carriers (12%) than non-carriers(6%), whereas TA-carriers more often reported travelling as \"backpackers\", 16% vs. 8%. The frequencies of TA-carriers after travel to the most visited countries (>10 travellers/country) were: India 82%, Egypt 57%, Peru 36%, Thailand 37%, South Africa 27% and Tanzania 24%, respectively. Conclusions: Travel increases the risk of faecal colonisation by ESBL-PE. Acquisition of ESBL-PE during travel is associated with abdominal symptoms such as diahorrea. Objectives: Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) is a worldwide public health problem. Few data are available on ESBL in Egypt. The aim of this study was to compare the fecal carriage of ESBL-producing enterobacteria (ESBL-E) in patients admitted to the hepatology department of 2 hospitals specialized in liver diseases, Theodor. Bilharz Research Institute (TBRI) in Cairo (Egypt) and Beaujon hospital (Bj) in Clichy (France). Methods: All patients admitted during May-June 2009 for more than 24 h in the hepatology department in TBRI and in Bj were screened at admission with a rectal swab for detection of ESBL-E digestive carriage. CTX-M groups were identified by PCR and TEM and SHV derivatives with the check point system. Phylogenetic groups of E. coli were determined by multiplex PCR and clone ST131 by PCR of gene pabB.The following demographic and clinical data were collected: gender, age, previous hospitalizations, underlying diseases and ascites. Results: During the study period, the prevalence of patients with ESBL-E was 77.6% (45/58) in TBRI and 6.5% (13/199) in Bj. A previous hospitalization was more common (p = 0.003) in Bj patients (93%) than in TBRI patients (45%). The 2 populations also differed with regard to the underlying diseases (p = 0.0003). We studied 49 ESBL-E from TBRI and 14 from Bj because 4 and 1 patients, respectively, had 2 ESBL-E. Of the 49 ESBL-E of TBRI, 90%, 8% and 2% were E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae, respectively. Of the 14 ESBL-E from Bj, 72%, 14%, 7% and 7% were E. coli, E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, respectively. The species distribution did not differ between the 2 countries. In TBRI, 59%, 29% and 12% of ESBL were enzymes of groups CTX-M-1, CTX-M-9 and SHV, respectively, whereas in Bj, 79%, 14% and 7% were of groups CTX-M-1, TEM and SHV, respectively.

The aim of our study was to determine whether admission to an ICU room previously occupied by a multidrugresistant Gram negative bacilli (MDRGNB) carrier increase the risk of acquiring these bacteria by subsequent patients. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study performed in a 30-bed ICU during a 1-year period. All patients hospitalized >48 h were eligible. Patients with MDRGNB at ICU admission were excluded. MDRGNB were defined as MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistant to imipenem or to ceftazidime), Acinetobacter baumannii, and extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing GNB. All patients were hospitalized in single rooms. The infection control policy included isolation techniques, routine screening of MDR bacteria (MDRGNB and MRSA), written antibiotic treatment protocol, and continuous surveillance of nosocomial infections. Isolation techniques were used for all patients at ICU admission, until receipt of screening results. In addition, these techniques were used for patients with MDR bacteria, and for all immunosuppressed patients. Routine screening of MDR bacteria (nasal, and anal swabs; and tracheal aspirate in intubated patients) was performed for all patients at ICU admission and weekly thereafter. Conclusion: Admission to an ICU room previously occupied by a MDR P. aeruginosa or an A. baumannii carrier is an independent risk factor for acquisition of these microorganisms by subsequent room occupants.",

Rectal carriage with GNB was determined twice weekly during ICU-stay. For each patient-day the status of intestinal GNB colonization was determined, creating patient-days with and without intestinal GNB colonization. Incidence densities of ICU-acquired GNB bacteremia were calculated for 1,000 patient-days with and without intestinal GNB colonization. Results: 730 patients (7762 patients-days at risk) were included and 650 (89%) had >1 episode of rectal GNB colonization during ICU-stay. 23 patients (3.2%) had >1 episode of ICU-acquired GNB bacteremia. Incidences of ICU-acquired GNB bacteremia were 6.1 and 1.9 per 1,000 patient days for the periods with and without intestinal GNB colonization [relative risk 3.78 (95% CI 1.66-8.61)].

Conclusion: Intestinal colonization with GNB during SDD is associated with an almost 4-fold risk of developing GNB bacteremia. 78% of ICUacquired bacteremia occurred after day 4, indicating that this association seems not to be influenced by cefotaxime use.",

In a point-prevalence study in post-acute-care facilities (PACFs), we previously identified type of ward, prolonged length of stay (LOS) and infection control policies as ecological factors associated with CRKP colonization. It is important to distinguish between ecological and individual-level risk factors in order to direct interventions appropriately. Here we extended our analysis to assess individual risk factors for colonization among residents without history of CRKP carriage. Methods: A point-prevalence study was conducted in 12 PACFs. Rectal swabs were obtained from residents without a history of CRKP carriage in 33 wards. Suspicious colonies growing on CHROMagar\u2122 KPC plates were speciated and tested for carbapenem susceptibilities by VITEK \u00ae 2, supplemented by Etest \u00ae . We used a nested, matched case-control study design to assess individual risk factors for colonization. Cases were defined as patients with positive rectal screening. Controls were selected from patients with negative rectal screening, matched to cases by ward. Patient data collected from medical records included demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, presence of skin lesions, presence of invasive devices, antibiotic exposure, number of colonized roommates, and PACF LOS. Results: Of 1004 residents without history of CRKP, colonization was detected in 119 (12%). Covariates entered into the matched multivariable model included: Norton score, antibiotic exposure during the past 3 months, skin lesions, receipt of amoxicillin-clavulanate during the past month and colonization with other resistant pathogens. Independent risk factors for CRKP colonization were: antibiotic exposure during the past 3 months (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.03\u22122.6, p = 0.04) and colonization with other resistant pathogens (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.06\u22122.6, p = 0.03). Conclusion: This nested, matched case-control study identified an important modifiable risk factor for CRKP colonization not identified in the ecological analysis: antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic control programs may have an important role in decreasing the burden of CRKP in PACFs.",

Methods: Monthly data on ESBL producing strains were collected retrospectively at two large university hospitals in the Southwest and Northeast Germany. For the analysis we focussed on E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca for consistency both between the two settings and during the study periods. Multivariate time-series analyses were carried out to explain variations in the monthly incidence densities of ESBL cases (E. coli-and/or Klebsiella-related ESBL cases per 1000 patient days) in the two settings (Berlin and Freiburg). For the final models, we were able to incorporate variables for the ascending linear trends and other variables representing the average monthly temperature. Results: Our models show that in general all the incidences of ESBL cases show an increasing trend. In addition, all incidences of ESBL cases responds positively to the average temperature, meaning that in summer when the temperature is high more ESBL cases were detected than during winter months (See Figure for details) . The study methodology was also applied to the incidences of MRSA in the two settings, but an association with the average temperature could not be detected.",

The risk for invasive Candida infections in cardiothoracic ICU patients was calculated using the following determinants: severe Candida colonization, leukocytosis or leucopenia, highest SOFA score >8, redo surgical procedures >2 and additional GIT surgery. Conclusion: Cardiothoracic ICU patients are at risk for invasive Candida infections at the presence of severe Candida colonization, leukocytosis or leucopenia, a SOFA score >8, additional GIT surgery and when undergoing multiple cardiothoracic interventions >3. Objectives: Candida bloodstream infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. While clinical and microbiologic factors affecting prognosis have been identified, the impact of immune responses, mediated by cytokines, on outcomes of infection remains to be studied. The present study assessed the role of genetic variation in cytokine genes on susceptibility and/or clinical outcomes of candidaemia. Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six cytokine genes (IFN-g, IL-10, IL-12B, IL-18, IL-1B, IL-8) and one cytokine receptor gene (IL-12RB) were genotyped and analyzed with logistic regression in 365 patients with candidaemia and 351 non-infected controls. In addition, the presence of these SNPs and measured concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines were further analyzed for association with persistent fungemia ( 5 days of positive blood cultures) in 325 Americans with candidaemia. Other variables were assessed including type of Candida spp. identified, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), dialysis dependence, malignancy, immunocompromised state, renal/liver failure. Variables with p < 0.10 on univariate analysis were further analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: None of the SNPs examined were associated with susceptibility to candidaemia. Mean age of candidaemia patients was 55 years (\u00b121.3), with 44% female, 32% African American, 58% immunocompromised, 31% active malignancy, 10% neutropenic, 43% recent surgery, 21% receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), 12% dialysis, 25% liver disease, and 49% ICU residence. The following species were identified: C. albicans (43%), C. glabrata (27%), C. parapsilosis (17%), C. tropicalis (12%), C. krusei (3%), >1 Candida species (6% In addition, significantly lower pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured in serum from patients with persistent fungemia. Conclusions: SNPs in IL-10 and IL12B were associated with persistent fungemia in candidaemia patients, which also associated with low serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This may provide insights for future targeted management strategies for patients with this high mortality condition.",

In recent clinical trials of CBSI, treatment with an echinocandin resulted in higher success rates. However, superiority has not been demonstrated. Given similarities in trial design and definitions, data from these trials can be combined in a metaanalysis. We compared the efficacy, measured as global clinical success at the end of intravenous therapy, of an echinocandin vs. a comparator AF agent in the treatment of CBSI. Methods: We used standard metaanalysis methodology and a random effect model. We conducted a literature search to identify all randomized, controlled, trials (RCTs), assessing the efficacy of an echinocandin (caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin) in CSBI. To evaluate whether the comparator (fluconazole or amphotericin preparations) success rates were consistent with previously published data, we conducted an additional literature search of all RCTs in which these agents were evaluated. Articles were reviewed independently by 2 reviewers. The corresponding authors and sponsors were approached for additional data. Results: 8 RCTs were included: 3 comparing an echinocandin to comparator antifungal (CAF), 1 comparing two echinocandins, and 4 comparing amphotericin preparations to fluconazole. The summary odds ratio for global success was 1.58 (95% CI 1.07-3.54) in favor of echinocandin therapy. The removal of a high-recruiting center that had a high anidulafungin response-rate had an insignificant impact on the results (OR 0. 1.46 95% CI 1.10-1.94). Global success rates observed in all included RCTs of fluconazole (5 treatment arms), amphotericin (4 arms) and the echinocandins (5 arms) were 62%, 73%, and 83%, respectively. In the echinocandin trials, success rates observed in the CAF arms were consistent with prior published trials. In an additional analysis that included only CBSI caused by C. albicans, echinocandin therapy resulted in higher success rate vs the CAF (74%; 95% CI 69\u221278% vs 59%; 95% CI 51\u221266%).",

Methods: This is a retrospective analysis from a candidemia study conducted between January 2001 and June 2005 at an oncology cancer center in Brazil. Eligible patients were those whose catheters were eventually removed. We excluded patients who died within 72 h after the candidemia onset or had catheters in place for 48 h. Early catheter removal was defined as those catheters withdrawn 72 h after the onset of candidemia. Results: We enrolled 164 patients with a 10.4% overall mortality rate. Multivariate analysis revealed the temporary nontunneled central venous catheter type (OR, 5.06; 95% CI 2.16-11.83) as the only variable independently associated with early removal. Among the 82 episodes not catheter related, 52 catheters (63%) were removed at doctor's discretion due to the urgency for cancer treatment continuance. Most of these removal (n = 46) occurred within 3 days of the index blood culture. No differences in the overall mortality rates were seen among patients with early or delayed catheters removal (P > 0.05).

This, combined with the lack of development of new antimicrobials, necessitates a review of current treatment strategies. Strategies which will be discussed in this symposium will include the benefits of appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment for serious infections, and more rational ways of administration (higher doses and varying infusion times) of some antimicrobials. Resistance development is well monitored in Europe, with resources such as the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS), and additional country and local surveillance (e.g. PEG-surveillance in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). Data will be presented on resistance profiles and evolution rates within the intensive care unit, where the challenge is to contain and prevent the spread of resistance. These data are critical for the rational choice of adequate empirical antibiotic treatment which will not lead to failure. This can be achieved using broad-spectrum, potent agents, which are least likely to select for resistance, before changing to a more targeted therapy (de-escalation) once susceptibilities have been determined. These methods allow us to use our limited armamentarium effectively. If this approach is not followed, the risk of failure and increased mortality associated with initial inadequate antibiotic treatment, the emergence of resistant strains while on therapy, and their subsequent spread to others, are the main consequences. The number of new antibiotics to treat multidrugresistant pathogens in the pipeline are too few, particularly those against Gram-negative bacteria and those with new mechanisms of action. New strategies are needed to close the gap between the burden of infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria and the development of new antibiotics.",

Dr Livermore will discuss current resistance issues from a microbiological perspective. The concept of potency and how it relates to minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and breakpoints will be covered, with particular reference to carbapenems and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where simple mutations leading to loss of the 'carbapenem-specific' porin OprD can confer frank resistance to imipenem whereas resistance to meropenem or doripenem additionally requires some upregulation of efflux. For reasons that remain obscure, these latter combinations of mechanism usually have a lesser effect on doripenem MICs than those of meropenem. In these circumstances there is potential for the dosing of carbapenems to affect the likelihood of resistance development, though any practical significance remains to be confirmed in clinical studies, particularly for the meropenem / doripenem comparison. In contrast to P. aeruginosa, carbapenem-resistance in Acinetobacter spp. is due to OXA-carbapenemases. Some low-level producers may remain marginally susceptible to imipenem (not meropenem or doripenem) but there seems little general scope to overcome resistance by dosage adjustment for any of the compounds. Among Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem resistance can arise either via combinations of porin loss together with production of extended-spectrum or AmpC-lactamases or via the production of true carbapenemases. The former mechanism, mostly seen in Klebsiella or Enterobacter spp. affects ertapenem more than any other analogue and this compound therefore seems most likely to act as a selector; the true carbapenemases \u2212 including IMP, VIM and NDM (New Delhi Metallo) zinc-enzymes as well as the KPC and OXA-48 serine types affect all carbapenems, and it seems unlikely that any could be overcome by dosage adjustment, though some might, in the future, be overcome by carbapenem/inhibitor combinations.",

Evidence from Monte Carlo simulations, animal models and clinical studies have led to realworld recommendations, such as using extended infusions and other strategies to maximise efficiency of b-lactams. Prolonged and continuous infusions can give better efficacy, can lower the likelihood of resistance developing through higher trough levels and eliminate or at least reduce the need to increase the dose. b-lactam antibiotics that can be dosed via continuous/prolonged infusions include penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. However, data should be assessed for each antimicrobial. For example, doripenem exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and does not accumulate with repeated dosing over 7 days, which supports its use as a prolonged infusion. Dr Pea will compare differences between carbapenems and classic b-lactams. Dosing strategies for different carbapenems will be discussed, including their stability and safety profiles. Practical considerations for prolonged infusions include having knowledge of the relationship of serum levels to target organ levels for different antimicrobials and an awareness of differences in PK and PD parameters among diverse patient groups. Dr Pea will conclude with a discussion on which particular patient populations, such as those with Pseudomonas infection, may benefit most from continuous infusions.

Children may shed the virus in saliva and urine for months or years, but the relative portion of this kind of horizontal transmission from children to children or from children to adults is unknown. Also the horizontal transmission among adults, besides sexual intercourse, is not well descript, but unlikely. In medical care, HCMV can be transmitted by blood products or organ transplantation. As with all other herpesviruses, HCMV has the ability to establish latent/silent infection in the host after primary infection. Activation from silent infection can occur under immunosuppression, during pregnancy and during lactation. Individuals can be infected with multiple strains, meaning secondary infection as exogenous reinfection or endogenous reactivation may occur. HCMV disease with various symptoms can result from either primary or secondary infection, also in primary infection disease is more severe and more frequent. The outcome of congenital HCMV infection is variable. About 10\u221215% of infected newborns exhibit clinical symptoms at birth such as CNS sequelae with hearing loss, cognitive impairment and cerebral palsy. Remarkably from 85\u221290% of HCMV infected newborns who are asymptomatic at birth will later develop hearing loss in about 15%. In both symptomatic and clinical asymptomatic newborns, sequelae often are not apparent in the first months or years of life.

However, equivalent studies are yet to be reported for the species formed when carbapenems associate with class A carbapenemases. Using X-ray crystallography we have now studied the interactions of the carbapenem meropenem with a model class A carbapenemase (SFC-1 from Serratia fonticola) in which we have used directed mutagenesis to trap the substrate and acylenzyme complexes. These structures show that SFC-1 binds carbapenems in a single well defined orientation where, in contrast to carbapenem-inhibited enzymes like SHV, the b-lactam amide nitrogen remains close to the active site Ser-130. We propose that this model represents productive binding of substrate and is likely to apply to other class A carbapenemases, including KPC enzymes. One approach to combatting carbapenemase-producing organisms is to combine b-lactams with an appropriate b-lactamase inhibitor. However, available b-lactamase-inhibitor combinations are variably effective against carbapenemase producers.

Even carbapenems lose activity when confronted with class C lactamases if the organism also has restricted outer membrane permeability. For example, loss of the OprD outer membrane porin of P. aeruginosa, which is essential for the rapid entry of imipenem into the periplasm, will lead to high-level resistance if a class C b-lactamase is expressed. In the last decades, a number of AmpC enzymes have been mobilized on plasmids or other genetic elements and have spread to organisms such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae that did not usually express AmpC. Carbapenem-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae that have altered porin expression and a plasmid-encoded AmpC b-lactamase have been reported from several countries. In general, class C lactamases are not well inhibited by the clinically available b-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam.

The observation of acyl-enzyme complex with the K70C mutant by X-ray crystallography also suggests that the deacylation step is rate limiting but the acylation step is also affected for the lysine mutants. Indeed, the values of the acylation constants (k2) are clearly lower than with the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic efficencies of the V117T mutant decrease for all substrates tested. The structure of the V117T OXA-10 mutant indicates that the Lys-70 is partially carboxylated at pH 8.0 in monomer A whereas monomer B contains a non-carboxylated Lys-70. This confirms that the valine residue in the hydrophobic core is important to promote the carboxylation of the Lys-70. It has been reported that class D b-lactamases are inhibited by chloride ions. Interestingly, in we could show that the inhibiton is due to the replacement of the side chain carboxylate group of the modified lysine by chloride ion.

In Europe there is great clonal diversity and new types are continually being reported, including the pigassociated ST398 strain (usually PVL\u2212) that is common in Denmark and the Netherlands but now spreading elsewhere. Although new CA-MRSA clones continue to appear, successful older ones are being introduced into new geographical areas by travellers and immigrants. CA-MRSA pneumonia is uncommon worldwide but increasing. It may follow influenza in previously healthy people and may cause fatal necrotizing disease, usually associated with PVL-producing CA-MRSA. PVL-positive staphylococci produce necrotizing pneumonia in animal experiments but the role of PVL in human disease is still under debate. Although PVL+ USA300 is the most frequent strain causing pneumonia, this may be because it is common; it remains to be seen whether other types of CA-MRSA, including PVL\u2212 strains, also have this ability. With the continuing spread of CA-MRSA and the on-going influenza pandemic, we can expect the incidence of severe CA-MRSA pneumonia to increase. HA-MRSA pneumonia in ventilated patients is well recognised and has a poor prognosis. CA-MRSA is now spreading in hospitals and becoming increasingly multi-drug resistant (MDR). Physicians should be aware of the threat of hospital-acquired pneumonia with virulent, PVLproducing MDR CA-MRSA and national and international organisations should provide appropriate surveillance systems for CA-MRSA.",

            "text": "Many patients require a central venous catheter or an arterial line. Although indispensable and of benefit, vascular access devices pose a potential risk of complications due to central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). The risk for CLABSI varies between 1 to 7 episodes or more per 1000 catheter-days depending on ward-type, institution and socio-economic status of the country. Most successful CLABSI prevention strategies are multimodal and include a combination of effective single intervention measures. Some measures are \"procedural\", such as using maximal sterile barrier precautions at catheter insertion, avoiding the femoral site, strict hand hygiene and applying a non-touch technique for catheter handling, opening hubs on antiseptic-impregnated pads, change of tubing only when indicated, and avoiding unnecessary access to the system. Furthermore, any indication for a central line insertion must be justified and catheters should be removed as soon as possible. Other intervention measures are more \"technical\", such as chlorhexidinecontaining products for skin antisepsis, chlorhexidine dressings at the catheter insertion site, impregnated catheters with antibiotics or chlorhexidine and silver-sulfadiazine, access devices coated with silver particles, and closed infusion systems. A promising approach in CLABSI prevention is the use of lock-solutions consisting of taurolidine-citrate, ethanol, EDTA or citrate/methylene-blue/paraben. Although there is evidence that some intervention combinations or bundles are effective, no specific combination should be considered superior to another. However, effort, complexity and costs may limit the possibility to apply all measures together. Even more important, infection prevention measures, and especially procedures, are of no use if they are not respected in daily practice. Most episodes of CLABSI are identified in the intensive care unit where care is complex. In such an environment, attention may be drawn away from infection control measures. Thus, infection control measures must be simple and easy to integrate into daily practice. Furthermore, it is indispensable to promote an infection control culture among nurses and physicians to ensure that prevention measures are observed under stress conditions. Although technical devices may be of help in stress situations, the failure to adopt a safety culture cannot be replaced by the use of impregnated catheters, chlorhexidine dressings or lock solutions.",

            "text": "Antimicrobials against biofilm-based catheter-related infections: new perspectives. In the last decades, different strategies have been developed to prevent microbial colonization of intravascular catheters through surface adsorption or incorporation in the device polymer matrix of antibiotic/antifungal agents. However, the currently available medicated catheters have shown to inhibit microbial biofilm formation for relatively short periods, mainly due to the massive release of the loaded antimicrobial agents in the first 24 h followed by a slow release at sub-inhibitory concentrations until drug exhaustion, this phenomenon involving the risk of emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. To overcome these limitations, we focused our research efforts in developing different experimental approaches to prevent microbial colonization of central venous catheters based on the adsorption of antimicrobial agents to synthesized and properly functionalized polyurethanes with the aim to control drug adsorption and release. Firstly, we have impregnated appropriately functionalized polyurethanes with two antibiotics with different mechanisms of action, rifampicin and cefamandole nafate, along with pore forming agents such as albumin and polyethylene glycol. This in vitro model exhibited a good polymer/antibiotic affinity and the ability to obtain a controlled release of large amounts of antimicrobials for up to 23 days. These results suggest that the entrapping of antibiotic molecules and pore-formers in properly functionalized polyurethanes may represent a promising approach to prevent catheter colonization and onset of bacterial resistance. Other antibiofilm strategies we are dealing with concern: i) the development of antimicrobial polymers by the use of polyurethanes able to coordinate metal ions (Ag+, Zn2+, etc); ii) the exploiting of the biofilm matrix-degrading enzyme, Dispersin B, to allow a better penetration of antibiotics through the microbial biofilm, thus improving their activity; iii) the development of a magnetic nanoparticles-based targeting system to fight catheter-related infections by an in situ, on demand, antimicrobial treatment.",

As in all travellers, a detailed travel, exposure and immunisation history is essential, combined with knowledge of patient comorbidities that may predispose to acquiring certain infections. In general, malaria is less likely to be the cause of fever than other infections, contrasting strongly with the differential diagnosis in travellers arriving from Africa. However, recent increases in malaria transmission in tourist areas such as Goa remind us of the need to maintain a high index of suspicion and continually to review pretravel advice on prevention. The emergence of artemesinin resistance in the Thai-Myanmar border area is a concern for the future.",

Importation of scrub typhus is less common than is tick typhus in travellers from Africa. Leptopirosis is associated with fresh water activities popular with tourists in South East Asia, such as white water rafting and \"tubing\", but imported schistosomiasis from this area is rare. Eosinophilia is more likely to be due to other enteric or systemic helminth or fluke infections. Enteric fevers are common in travellers from the Indian subcontinent, with recent predominance of paratyphoid A, which is often resistant to fluoroquinolones and multidrug resistant to other first line agents. Empirical treatment while awaiting culture results and resistance data should avoid such agents and include a third generation cefalosporin and/or azithromycin. Antimicrobial resistance is common in infections imported from this area, including extended spectrum b-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria, and multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Respiratory infections are common in any traveller, and influenza has been demonstrated to be the most frequent vaccine preventable infection acquired by tourists in South East Asia. Recent experience with SARS and ongoing concerns in the region about avian influenza remind us of the continued risk in this region of the emergence of novel virus infections spread by the respiratory route.",

Van den Ende\u00b0(Antwerp, BE) Kabisa, a computer based tutorial for tropical medicine, has been developed since 1992, the first version in foxpro, the second in C++, the third in MS Access XP, and the last in Delphi. (Van den Ende et al. 1997a ) For developing countries it is a didactic tool that challenges the student with cases electronically assembled from a randomly generated disease and randomly chosen related presenting symptoms. The student should find the diagnosis with a set of disease characteristics, available in the context of a hospital in developing countries. The logical engine is based upon both pattern recognition and Bayesian logic. For a Western context the programme offers also an expert system for imported fever, based on a prospectively generated database of over 2000 patients. The expert module is innovative with the suggestion of new tests based on the data already provided by the user. In this suggestion, a threshold driven logic is followed: (Pauker & Kassirer 1980) for the highest ranked diagnosis strong excluders are asked for, once this diagnosis is worked out less probable hypotheses are examined also. Ranking of suggested tests takes into account power, feasibility, risk and cost. During the session, real examples will be played and the application of the logic shown. If wanted, detailed explanation of the programming can be given. Participants are invited to bring their laptop; the program will be installed and distributed for free. Reference(s) [1] Pauker, S.

These data will represent a valuable tool both for surveyed facilities, in order to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and for European authorities, providing an \"on-the-field\" evaluation of European hospitals' capabilities in dealing with HIDs. , Greece (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), Latvia (n = 1), Luxemburg (n = 1), Portugal (n = 2), Slovenia (n = 2) and Spain (n = 1). Observations were performed by trained research nurses at random dates, times and bed spaces during 6 months using a standardized protocol derived from the WHO \"5 moments\" method. No feedback of results or training of staff was allowed. A standardized test was used to assess inter-observer variation. Results: The mean bed occupancy rate was 85% (58\u221299%) and ICUs had on average 13.11 (9\u221221) beds, with 61% of patients being ventilated (43\u221281%). The average nurse-to-patient ratio (per occupied bed) was 0.52 (0.34-0.91). HHC rates varied from 7% to 88% (mean: 48%). Nurses' HHC was higher than physicians' HHC (mean: 51 vs 39%) in all but two centers. Auxiliary nurses and other healthcare workers had intermediate HHC (42% and 44%, respectively). When separated per indication category (i.e. hand hygiene before and after actions that require hand hygiene), HHC was higher in the latter group (43 vs 57%, p = 0.003). 45% of missed hand hygiene opportunities involved the use of gloves, mainly before performing an aseptic task or after possible body fluid contact.

It became clear that in line with the improved quality of life of the elderly population in industrialized countries, the treatment of G1 is more comparable to that of younger adults. Importantly, future analyses on AM use should take several age groups of the elderly population into consideration. In 20 NH no residents received AB. In the total NHpopulation 4% (0\u221257%) had an urinary catheter, and of these, 17% received an AB. Wounds were present in 10% of the population (0\u221275%) and AB were prescribed in 15% of them. Vascular catheters were uncommon (0.78%) but 36% of this sub-population used an AB. Among residents with AB, 24% had a recent hospital stay. In total 1757 AB molecules were used.

Conclusion: Strong differences in AB-prevalence and device-use were observed in EU NH. Both micro (case-mix)-and macro determinants (cultural differences) partially contribute to these differences. The high proportion of AB-use for urinary tract, especially the important part of uroprophylaxis, was surprising and needs to be explored. A median of 9.7% (11.7% mean) of all NH residents (n = 26,063) was diagnosed with an undefined wound. Among residents treated with ABs (n = 1734), 24% had a wound.

Of the AB using residents 2.5% was treated (i.e. prophylactic, empirical or documented) for a wound infection (WI). Among AB using residents with wounds 7% was treated for a WI.

The purpose of this report is to increase awareness of the usefulness of the programme and provide a ten year trend analysis of antibiotic consumption. Material and Methods: The data on antibiotic consumption based on the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system were collected from 64 Swedish ICUs and entered into the database using the web application. Antibiotic consumption was expressed as defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 occupied bed day (DDD1000). We used the annually updated DDD calculated by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology as the average maintenance dose per day in adults for the main indication of the drug(http://www.whocc.no/atcddd). Data were analysed using the non-parametric test for trend across ordered groups and Spearman's rank correlation using STATA/SE 9.2(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) and SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Trend analyses of usage of different classes of antibiotics were performed and showed increased carbapenem, triazole and piperacillintazobactam consumption (p < 0.001). There was no significant change in consumption of cephalosporins for the ten year period but a trend towards decreased consumption the last two years. No significant correlation between antibiotic consumption and standardised mortality rate was shown. Conclusion: The high antibiotic consumption concurs with figures from European and US ICUs in general, but like a few ICUs in our programme, relatively low antibiotic consumption has been reported from Switzerland. The lower antibiotic consumption suggests that it is possible to reduce antibiotic consumption in the critically ill, but it has to be accompanied with a quality control system to make sure that it does not compromise patient outcomes.",

The lack of an appropriate pharmacy information technology and inadequate education and training on antimicrobial consumption data collection and reporting are some of the main issues of concern. Results from the evaluation of the consumption trends demonstrate the need to monitor hospital-wide and individual speciality wards/units separately. Limitations of the ATC/DDD system have been identified and taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Conclusion: Variation exists in the methods of collecting and reporting for antimicrobial consumption. The study has shown that setting up of antimicrobial consumption databases expressed in DDD/100 beddays can be done at a local level. An antimicrobial consumption database should be available in all hospitals to facilitate the close monitoring of antimicrobial consumption, frequent feedback reporting to the prescribers and also to supplement the surveillance of microbial resistance. Results: Out of a total of 5,733 patients antibiotics were prescribed in 3,732 (66.3%). These prescriptions contained 1\u22123 antibiotics, with a mean of 1.28 antibiotics per prescription. Indications were respiratory tract infections (32.2%), vaginal discharge (26.3%), urinary tract infections (16.3%), skin and soft tissue infections (15%), diarrhoea (9.2%) and prophylaxis (1%). Quinolones were the commonest group prescribed. Antibiotic prescribing was 37% less in academic hospital (P < 0.001). Prescribing peaked in rainy season with 70% of patients prescribed antibiotics. The independent predictors of antibiotic prescribing were seasons (2nd winter > 1st winter), facility (for profit > academic), age groups (adults > children), education level (illiterate > more educated), productive cough at presentation, ear discharge, pneumonia and dysentery. The number of patients per diagnosis, prescription rate with commonest prescribed antibiotic group with DDDs/ TPD per group is shown in table. Conclusions: Statistically significant association between antibiotic prescribing and seasons, for profit hospital, age groups, education level, symptom of productive cough at presentation, ear discharge, pneumonia and dysentery was found. High use of quinolones is a cause of concern.",

The most commonly prescribed antifungal was fluconazole, accounting for 60% of all antifungal therapy followed by caspofungin (10%). The most frequently used antifungal-antibacterial combinations included fluconazole plus either a quinolone or a b-lactam, mainly for medical prophylaxis. The proportion of parenteral use within the total antimycotic prescriptions was 47%. The oral route accounted for 60% of fluconazole prescriptions. In 38% of cases the site of infection was undefined whilst the most common sites were respiratory (20%), gastro-intestinal (16%) and ENT (4%). The medical specialty accounted for the majority (69%) of antifungal use. Hospital acquired infections represented 46% of all the indications followed by medical prophylaxis at 30%. Conclusion: These ESAC-PPS results showed minimal variation in treatment for fungal infections. This was mainly observed in the predominance of fluconazole. However, high use of fluconazole can increase the prevalence of other fungi, e.g., Candida glabrata, and therefore increase the need for newer antifungals which are active against inherently resistant pathogens. Ongoing surveillance will enhance efforts to limit the extent of antifungal use and resistance. Antifungal prophylaxis in the immunocompromised host needs further exploration.

Conclusion: Resistance rates in hospital-acquired lower respiratory isolates are broadly similar to those in bacteraemia, but may differ substantially in some cases. More data and analysis are needed to clarify the influence of factors such as patient age and treating speciality on these apparent differences in resistance between respiratory and blood isolates. Direct surveillance of resistance in specific infections is preferable to extrapolation from data obtained in bacteraemia, when possible.",

Melo-Cristino (Lisbon, PT) Objectives: Although S. pyogenes is universally susceptible to penicillin, in the treatment of complicated Group A Streptococci (GAS) infections such as necrotizing fasciitis or STSS, the association of penicillin with clindamycin has been advocated. Resistance to the latter has been described in GAS, associated with resistance to macrolides. The aim of this work was to evaluate the resistance of GAS invasive isolates to several antimicrobial agents and to further characterize the macrolide resistance isolates. Methods: A total of 306 invasive GAS isolates recovered in Portugal during 2000-2008 were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and linezolid by disk diffusion. Intermediate susceptibilities were confirmed by MIC determination using E-test strips. Resistance genotypes were determined by PCR. Results: All the 306 GAS isolates were susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and linezolid, and only two (0.7%) presented reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin (MIC = 3 and 4 ug/ml). A total of 32 isolates (10.5%) were resistant to erythromycin. Of these, 20 were also constitutively resistant to clindamycin (cMLSB phenotype, 62.5%), whereas 12 presented the M phenotype (37.5%). The cMLSB phenotype was associated with the presence of the erm(B) gene, whereas the M phenotype was associated with mef(A). Non-susceptibility to tetracycline was found in 42 isolates (13.7%), of which 8 also expressed the cMLSB phenotype and 1 the M phenotype. Conclusion: Erythromycin resistance among invasive GAS isolates in Portugal did not vary significantly during 2000-2008, contrarily to what has been reported for isolates causing pharyngitis, whose macrolide resistance decreased from 1999 to 2006. The macrolide resistance observed in this study for invasive GAS isolates (10.5%) is in line with reports from other countries, as well as with the overall rate reported for pharyngitis isolates in Portugal during 2004-2006 (13.2%) .",

In this period 730 revisions were reported to NAR from these ten hospitals. The total number of reported revisions was 1443 from all Norwegian hospitals. In this study we included operations with one or more positive sample. The bacteria were tested against different antibiotics at different hospitals and in different time periods. We used the c 2 test for linear trend to evaluate changes in distribution of sensitive, intermediate and resistant (S, I, R) bacteria over time.

The heteroresistance to metronidazole in fresh isolates were detected by disc diffusion and Etest methods. Resistance molecular basis was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Results: 16 different PCR ribotypes were identified with a dominant clone 017 accounting for 37.3% of the isolates, followed by 001 and H. Ribotype 027 was not found but one isolate belonged to ribotype 078. All the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, 18 of 78 (23.1%) isolates were found to be transient heteroresistant to metronidazole. Resistance to moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, rifampin, rifaximin and fusidic acid was found in 61.8%, 100%, 66.4%, 85.3%, 88.1%, 62.7%, 29.1%, 29.1% and 8.2% of the isolates, respectively. The isolates of common PCR ribotypes were more resistant than the uncommon ribotypes. The prevalence of resistance genes and mutations among the resistant isolates was as follows: ermB, 69.1%; tetM, 97.1%; gyrA mutation, 63.2%; gyrB mutation, 4.4%; gyrA and gyrB mutation, 32.4%, rpoB mutation, 100%, respectively. The fusA mutation was only found in one isolate with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 mg/L. The genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae comprises about 70 different virus species, many of which are arthropod-borne and transmitted to their vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes or ticks. Among those, the most important human pathogens are yellow fever virus, dengue viruses types 1 to 4, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Depending on specific and different natural host systems, these viruses differ with respect to their areas of geographical distribution but \u2212 at least in some instances \u2212 have the potential to emerge as new pathogens in previously non-endemic regions. Flaviviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that have a lipid envelope and only three structural proteins, designated C (capsid), M (membrane) and E (envelope). Non-infectious, immature particles \u2212 containing a precursor of the M protein (prM) \u2212 are formed intracellularly and the proteolytic cleavage of prM by the cellular protease furin generates mature and infectious virions shortly before their release from infected cells. With respect to their structure, flaviviruses are among the best-studied enveloped viruses. The atomic structures of E proteins of several flaviviruses have been determined using X-ray crystallography, and the architectures of both immature and mature virions are known from cryo-electron microscopic studies. Through the combination of structural and immunological investigations, we have gained a detailed understanding of the effects of antibody-binding to the virus and its different antigens. This includes the definition of virus neutralization and antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) of infectivity at a molecular level. The latter phenomenon has been proposed to play an important role in the immunopathology of severe forms of dengue virus infections (hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome) in the course of sequential infections with different dengue serotypes. All of these structural insights have also shed new light on the different degrees of cross-reactivity between flaviviruses, including the existence of cryptic epitopes that are recognized by broadly flavivirus cross-reactive Nocardia infections S109 antibodies without leading to neutralization. The current picture of antibody interactions with flaviviruses will be presented in the context of their biological significance. Treatment of invasive aspergillosis: pharmacokinetics vs. resistance S496 Clinical impact of azole resistance P. Verweij\u00b0 (Nijmegen, NL) The class of the azoles have become the most prominent class of compounds for the management of invasive aspergillosis. The clinically licensed triazoles with activity against Aspergillus include itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole. The azoles are also the only drugs that can be administered orally. The azoles interact with the biosynthesis of ergosterol, which is an important component of the fungal cell membrane. Intrinsic resistance to azoles has been documented for A. calidoustus, but the vast majority of species are susceptible in vitro.",

It appears that resistance may develop during azole therapy, especially in patients with chronic therapy including patients with chronic infection and aspergilloma. Another route of resistance development may be exposure of Aspergillus to azole fungicides that are used in our environment. Patients would then inhale azole-resistant conidia and develop azole-resistant aspergillosis. The consequence of this route of transmission is that azole-resistant disease may occur in patients without previous exposure to azole compounds. Azole resistance is commonly due to mutations in the Cyp51A-gene and is associated with different phenotypes. Isolates may be resistant to a single azole compound, but more commonly a cross-resistant phenotype is observed. Several cases of azole-resistant aspergillosis have been reported and commonly these patients failed to respond to azole therapy. Azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates remain virulent and are capable of causing invasive disease in patients at risk. The efficacy of azole compounds against azole-resistant isolates, with different resistance mechanisms, has been investigated in experimental models of invasive aspergillosis. These indicate that the minimal inhibitory concentration has major impact on the efficacy of the azole. Elevated MICs are associated with loss of efficacy of the azole compounds in vivo. The use of azoles should be avoided in patients with azole-resistant aspergillosis, if possible. Alternative agents such as lipid-formulations of amphotericin B or caspofungin appear to retain their efficacy against azole-resistant isolates. A significant problem is the early diagnosis of azole-resistance as in the majority of cases an isolate is not obtained and, if an isolate is cultured, in vitro susceptibility testing causes delay in treatment with effective agents.",

Many ID have successfully been eradicated through vaccination and the course of some infections has changed due to improved standard of life. On the other hand, changes in life style and longer life expectancy have promoted the emergence and spread of new ID. In spite of rigorous attempts to control hospital care associated infections these infections are becoming a growing problem in modern medicine. The appearance of multiply resistant organisms and the shortage of new antibiotics in the pipeline have placed further demands on developing expertise in the difficult field of antibiotic stewardship. Therefore, the profession of an ID doctor in the 21st century is a very complex one. He or she should have good skills and knowledge in recognizing traditional infectious diseases even those that are believed to be eradicated or not frequent in the area of practice. However, over the past decades infectious diseases with typical clinical presentation and a well defined pathogen have been to a significant extent replaced by infections whose symptoms overlap with the symptoms of the underlying diseases in the same patient or can not be easily differentiated from other causes of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Therefore an ID doctor has to have good communication skills in dealing with other colleagues of different specialties and should be used to work in a team, appreciating different skills brought by different disciplines. From a clinical microbiologist point of view an ideal infectious disease specialist should recognize that the field of clinical microbiology (CM) has undergone the same transformation from mostly research and public health oriented microbiology towards microbiology at the patient bedside. In many patients only individual approach and team work will produce satisfactory diagnosis and treatment of infection. The fact that skills and competencies of modern ID and CM doctors overlap to a greater extent than with other specialties makes a solid ground for a close collaboration and partnership between these two professions. This is important in the field of clinical practice as well as in the field of research. There is a growing number of literature related to infectious diseases and anyone involved in the management of such patients should have a basic knowledge in research methodology and be competent in practicing evidence based medicine.",

The number of cases reported in the literature is increasing. This might be due to an absolute increase in the number of immunocompromised patients but also to improvement in laboratory techniques to detect nocardiosis. Host resistance to nocardial infection depends on neutrophils in early lesions and then the cell-mediated immune response. The most common predisposing factors to opportunistic nocardia infections are long-term steroid usage, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neoplastic disease, and human immunodeficiency virus infection. Clinical manifestations of nocardiosis range from cutaneous infections caused by traumatic inoculation in normal hosts to severe pulmonary and central nervous system diseases in immunocompromised hosts. The genus of Nocardia is rapidly expanding and the species distribution varies with different geographical locations. Previous studies also emphasized the importance of determining the species of Nocardia, because different species and isolates vary in their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Sulphonamides have been used in the treatment of nocardiosis since the 1940s and are still the drugs of choice and the most common antimicrobials used to treat these infections. Sulphonamide monotherapy, however, was associated with mortality rates of almost 50% for patients with central venous system (CNS) nocardial infections. In addition, patients with non-CNS infections who had overwhelming or disseminated disease had a high mortality rate when treated with sulphonamides alone. However, currently available therapeutic alternatives are scarce and only comprise amoxicillin/clavulanate, carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem) and amikacin. Resistance to previously administered drugs, the toxicity and intolerance of the antimicrobials and even therapeutic failure necessitate the search for alternative agents.",

Yet, data regarding their effectiveness in reducing influenza complications are scarce. Methods: We evaluated the effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing influenza complications and mortality of patients with seasonal influenza, by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus databases, comparing neuraminidase inhibitors with placebo. Results: Eleven RCTs (10 double-blinded. 1 with an open-label design) were included; 8 involved adults and adolescents. In total, 5315 patients were included; 3491 (65.7%) with confirmed infection. Total influenzarelated complications occurred significantly less likely in otherwise healthy patients with confirmed infection treated with antivirals versus placebo [7 RCTs, 2621 patients, OR (odds ratio)=0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.58-0.87]. This finding was more pronounced in highrisk patients (4 RCTs, 475 patients, OR = 0.26, 95% CI=0.15-0.47), compared with otherwise healthy patients (p < 0.01). In the comparisons regarding other respiratory complications, a trend in favour of antivirals was observed. Regarding acute otitis media specifically, a significant difference was observed. Significantly fewer antibiotics were also administered in patients with confirmed infection treated with antivirals versus placebo (6 RCTs, 1921 patients, OR = 0.77, 95% CI=0.62-0.96). No differences were found in the comparisons regarding the safety outcomes of our meta-analysis. Mortality data were scarcely reported. No deaths were reported in the respective trials. Conclusions: Neuraminidase inhibitors appear to be effective in reducing total influenza-related complications both in otherwise healthy with confirmed infection and high-risk patients. They also reduce additional antibiotic consumption. ; solid tumors, 6 (25%); lymphoma, 6 (25%); multiple myeloma, 3 (12%) and chronic leukemia, 2 (8%).

No patients had laboratory-documented bacterial infections at the illness onset, however all received antibacterial agents at presentation. Seventeen patients developed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and severe hypoxemia was present in 15 cases (88.2%). Of these, 11 underwent mechanical ventilation. Twenty-two patients were treated with oseltamivir and, in 37.5% of them a double dose was prescribed. Median time from admission to antiviral therapy start was 5 days (range: 0\u221220 days). Antiviral therapy was started within 48 h of symptoms in only 10 patients (22%). Main reasons for therapy delay were the lack of specificity symptoms in neutropenic patients and the initial difficulty to obtain antiviral drugs. Five patients died (21%), and two of them never received oseltamivir. In the other 3 cases, the therapy was only started 8, 9 and 15 days after hospital admission.",

Blot\u00b0( Ghent, BE) Objective: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit. Reducing inoculums of oral pathogenic microorganisms by adequate oral care could prevent VAP. Methods: A systematic review of the literature concerning oral decontamination with chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine on intubated patients, and subsequent meta-analysis evaluating the effects of oral decontamination on the incidence of VAP was performed. Relevant articles were searched for in electronic databases as PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and CENTRAL and supplemented by manual searches of reference lists. Only randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of oral care with use of chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine vs. oral care without use of an antiseptic on the incidence of VAP in adult intubated patients were included. Data were extracted as dichotomous variables. Data analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0. Statistical analysis was conducted according the Mantel-Haenszel model to obtain the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi-2 test. Results: Eleven studies were included in the analysis (n patients = 1971) of which 9 that investigated the effect of oral care with use of chlorhexidine (n patients = 1862) and 2 that assessed the effect of oral care with use of povidone-iodine (n patients = 109). The use of an antisepticum resulted in a significant reduction of the incidence of VAP with a RR of 0.63 (95% CI 0.50-0.81; p = 0.0002). These results are valid for chlorhexidine (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53-0.88; p = 0.004) and povidone-iodine (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.19-0.75; p = 0.005). Among studies important differences exists concerning concentrations of the antiseptic used, frequency of oral care, and study methodology and diagnostic criteria for VAP. Clinical heterogeneity was confirmed statistically and was moderate (c 2 = 43%; p = 0.08) for the trials using chlorhexidine and high (c 2 = 66%; p = 0.09) for those assessing povidone-iodine. Subgroup analyses revealed most beneficial effects with concentrations of 0.12% and 2% chlorhexidine and 10% povidone-iodine, and in a population of cardiac surgery patients.",

Thirteen patients (completers) received 3 infusions and 4 patients (non-completers) received 1 infusion. The study drug was safe and well tolerated. Panobacumab revealed a pharmacokinetic profile similar to a native IgM. Panobacumab could be detected in BAL samples collected after treatment indicating the antibody to reach the inflamed lung tissue. Clinically the initial mean CPIS and APACHEII score were 8.53 (7\u221211) and 18.2 (6\u221233) with an expected mortality of 29.6%. The overall observed mortality within 30 days after starting treatment was 17.6%. Despite an APACHEII score of 18.5 and expected mortality of 30.6% all completers survived within the first 30 days while non-completers showed a survival rate of 25%. Resolution of pneumonia was achieved by 9 out of 13 completers in 9.9\u00b14.3 days (mean\u00b1SD) including two patients which were initially inadequately treated.

Safety: 87% patients had Objectives: Osteomyelitis (OM) is a complicated and diverse disease and long term efficacy and safety of an antibiotic is an important determinant in selecting the optimal therapy. This is the first report of a large series of OM cases treated with daptomycin (DAP) across many countries in Europe. Methods: Data were collected as part of the European CUBICIN \u00ae Outcomes Registry and Experience (EU-CORE) program, a retrospective, non-interventional, observational, multicenter study designed to describe the clinical use of DAP. All patients (pts) who had a diagnosis of OM were selected from the database. Pts who were treated with at least one dose of DAP and for whom any safety parameter was assessed were included in safety population. Efficacy population was a subset of the safety population where clinical outcome (cure, improved, failure, or non-evaluable) was assessed by the investigators. Pts enrolled from Jan 2006 to Aug 2009 were included. Results: Of 2581 pts enrolled 161 (58.4% male, 42% 65 years) were diagnosed with OM. 90 (56%) cases of OM were non-prosthetic device related, 50 (31%) were permanent prosthetic device related, 21 (13%) were temporary prosthetic device related. For 103 pts (64%) primary pathogens have been reported. S. aureus (45/103) was the most frequent species, with MRSA (n = 19) as significant subset. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (41/103) ranked second. Most pts received DAP doses 6 mg/kg (76%). Median duration of DAP outpt therapy was 29 days (range: 4\u221282), and inpt therapy was 14 (range: 1-246). Overall clinical success (cured or improved) was seen in 73% (118/161) of pts and failure in 9% (14/161). 18% of pts were non-evaluable (29/161). In subgroup analyses, clinical success was observed in 72% (65/90) of pts without devices, 72% (36/50) of pts with permanent devices and 81% (17/21) of pts with temporary prosthetic devices. Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values were reported in 68% (109/161) of pts during DAP therapy. In 86% of pts (94/109) CPK levels remained within normal range. Discontinuation of DAP due to treatment failure was reported for 2 pts (1%) only. Serious AEs were reported in 3% (5/161) of pts. AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in 5% (8/161). Conclusion: DAP at doses 6 mg/kg once daily was the most frequent dose regimen used for osteomyelitis in Europe. DAP was well-tolerated also for longer treatment duration. These promising results warrant confirmation in additional studies. Objective: Treatment recommendations for invasive enterococcal infections advocate synergistic combinations such as ampicillin plus gentamicin. In case of resistance to one or even both of the drugs, vancomycin therapy is proposed, albeit it is poorly bactericidal. The Swiss surveillance program reports resistance of Enterococcus faecium to aminopenicillin and high-level gentamicin to be as high as 82% and 49%, respectively (www.anresis.ch). This leaves the clinician with a therapeutic conundrum since no established therapeutic regimen exists. Daptomycin is approved for complicated skin and soft tissue infections with Gram-positive bacteria and showed efficacy against E. faecium in the experimental endocarditis model. Methods: We report a case series of 11 patients with severe E. faecium infections treated with daptomycin at the University Hospital Basel between 2007 and 2009. All strains were resistant to ampicillin (MIC > 8 mg/l), but susceptible to vancomycin. 7/11 strains were also highly resistant to gentamicin (MIC > 500 mg/l). Results: All patients were treated with multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to isolation of E. faecium and had severe underlying diseases: Five had haematological malignancies, two had repeated episodes of cholangiosepsis, two suffered from severe atherosclerosis after multiple vascular surgical procedures, one had undergone liver transplantation and one had colon cancer. Foci were mainly blood stream infections or cholangitis. The reasons for daptomycin treatment were renal failure (n = 3), vancomycin failure (n = 4) despite vancomycin susceptibility (MIC 4 mg/l), outpatient parenteral therapy (n = 2) and uncontrolled infection (n = 2). With one isolate from a patient with persistent bacteremia, in vitro killcurves were performed, showing a bactericidal effect of daptomycin (loss of >3 log/CFU/24 h with 2 mg/l and 10 mg/l of the drug). In contrast, 10 mg/l of vancomycin was bacteriostatic. Daptomycin was used in a dose of 6 mg/kg/d. 7 patients recovered, 4 patients died. Death was related to uncontrollable infection in only one case, the other deaths were attributable to the underlying diseases. Conclusion: Our case series suggests that salvage therapy with daptomycin was likely to be efficient in 7/11 patients with refractory invasive infections due to multi-resistant E. faecium. Thus, daptomycin might be a safe option in such cases. Objective: Outbreaks of pandrug-resistant (PDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) have emerged in Singapore. Combination therapy is often the remaining viable option until new antibiotics are available. While polymyxin B (P) may remain a viable treatment option, heteroresistance has become a major problem. We evaluate the efficacy of P, rifampicin (R) and tigecycline (T) combined against PDR AB isolated from our local hospitals. Methods: PDR AB isolates from all public hospitals in Singapore were collected from 2006\u221207. MICs were determined according to a modified CLSI broth-dilution method. Time-kill studies (TKS) were then performed with the maximum, clinically achievable, unbound concentration (mg/L) of P (2), R (2) and T (2) alone and in combination against the PDR AB isolates. A hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) was used to validate our quantitative assessment of combined killing against 2 isolates (selected based on the unique genotype that represents the PDR AB population). Resistance selection of the 2 isolates against P alone in the HFIM were quantified using drug-free and selective (P at 3x MIC) media. Results: Among 361 non-repeat AB isolates screened, 29 PDR AB isolates found were susceptible to P (MICs 1\u22122 mg/L) and resistant to all antibiotic classes whereas R MICs ranged from 2\u221216 mg/L. In TKS, P, R and T alone was bacteriostatic with regrowth by 24 h in all isolates. P+R, P+T and R+T achieved >99% kill from baseline in 15/29, 14/29 and 8/29 isolates with no regrowth at 24 h. These assessments were consistent with observation in HFIM studies where we observe bacterial killing up to 120 h with P+R. Pharmacokinetic validation of the HFIM studies were satisfactory. Minimal killing of the 2 isolates was seen when exposed to P alone. Regrowth was seen at 24 h due to selective amplication of resistant sub-population(s) on P supplemented plates. Repeat MIC testing of the resistant isolates confirms P resistance (MICs 32-128 mg/L). Conclusions: We have shown that our PDR AB has the propensity to exhibit heteroresistance and combination therapy with P is needed. P+R may be a potential antibiotic combination as therapy for PDR AB infections. The in vivo relevance of our results warrants further investigations. As no data is available about antibiotic activity against intracellular P.a., we have developed a 24-h infection model using THP-1 cells, a human cell line known to be permissive for infection by several important human pathogens. This model has now been used to test for the activity of 4 antibiotics representative of 4 classes of drugs used in clinics to treat pseudomonal infections. Methods: Phagocytosis of bacteria (opsonized with human serum) was allowed for 2 h (bacteria/macrophage ratio: 10), extracellular bacteria were eliminated by washing and incubation for 60 min with gentamicin at 50 x MIC, and Infected cells (5\u22127\u00d710 5 CFU/mg cell prot.) incubated with antibiotics (0.01 to 100 \u00d7 MIC). Activity against bacteria in broth (1\u00d710 6 CFU/ml) was determined in parallel (same conc. span). Activity was expressed as change from the initial inoculum after 24 h, and the data used for fitting a concentration-response curve (Hill equation) and for calculation of the Emax and Cstatic pharmacodynamic parameters (AAC 2006; 50: 841\u221251) .",

In addition, CST and TOB showed a 6 to 9 fold decrease of relative potency (higher Cstatic) when comparing intracell. and extracell. bacteria. Conclusions: The model shows that, as for other intracell. bacteria, antibiotics are considerably less active and, for 2 classes, less potent, against intracellular forms compared to bacteria in broth, irrespective of their mode of action.

Objectives: To develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for delafloxacin (DFX) and use that model to estimate pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic (PK-PD) indices in Phase 2 patients treated for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI). Methods: Data from 3 Phase 1 studies (1 single dose, two multiple dose) and 1 Phase 2, cSSSI study were pooled to develop a population pharmacokinetic model. All doses were administered by IV infusion; doses ranged from 50 to 600 mg. The Phase 2 study employed doses of 300 or 450 mg BID. Intensive PK sampling was employed in all Phase 1 studies while Phase 2 patients contributed 4\u22125 samples at steady-state over one dosing interval. Population PK modeling was performed using Monte Carlo Parametric Expectation Maximization as implemented in S-ADAPT 1.5.6. Two and 3 compartment models were explored using linear and/or nonlinear elimination. Steady-state AUC and Cmax estimates were calculated using individual PK parameter estimates for Phase 2 patients and indexed to observed pathogen MICs to calculate PK-PD indices. Previous animal studies have indicated that free-drug AUC:MIC ratios (fAUC:MIC) of 9.3 and 14.3 are associated with net bacterial stasis and 1-log10 CFU reduction, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. Results: The final analysis dataset included 103 subjects (86 from Phase 1, 17 from Phase 2) and 2273 plasma concentrations. A 2 compartment model with a mix of linear and nonlinear elimination provided the most robust fit to the data (r 2 = 0.965, observed=1.02*fitted \u2212 0.032). All parameters were estimated with excellent precision; interindividual variability in the parameters that define clearance (linear clearance, intrinsic clearance, and Michaelis-Menten constant) ranged from 24\u221270%. Twelve patients had requisite MIC data to calculate a PK-PD index, all fAUCss:MIC estimates were above 100 (range: 108-3754); all 12 patients were classified as clinical and microbiological cures. The median (min \u2212 max) fCmax:MIC ratio was 191 (18.8-565). Seven patients had MRSA as their primary pathogen; MIC values were universally low (0.004-0.06).",

O520 Pharmacokinetics and penetration of ciprofloxacin into bronchial secretions of critically ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease P. Kontou\u00b0, K. Chatzika, G. Pitsiou, A. Boutou, P. Argyropoulou, I. Kioumis (Thessaloniki, GR) Objective: Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is one of the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of severe exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Antibiotic penetration into the site of infection is critical for obtaining an optimal clinical outcome. Since in COPD patients the infection develops within the airway lumen, it is important to know the drug concentrations that are achieved in bronchial secretions (BS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate CIP's pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in plasma and penetration into BS of mechanically ventilated COPD patients, when administered at the currently recommended dose of 1200 mg per day. Methods: Ninenteen critically ill COPD patients received a 1-hour infusion of 400 mg CIP q8 h. They all had a respiratory infection as well as risk factors for Ps. aeruginosa and they were intubated. Serial blood and BS samples were obtained at steady state. Concentrations were determined by a validated HPLC assay. Penetration ratio was calculated by dividing the 24 h area under the curve (AUC 0\u221224 ) of BS by the AUC 0\u221224 of plasma. The pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters for CIP were also calculated. Results: Mean\u00b1SD values for volume of distribution, clearance, halflife and AUC 0\u219224 were 174.31\u00b185.42 L, 27.32\u00b19.53 L/h, 5.5\u00b12.34 h and 47.58\u00b118.07, respectively. The mean peak (C max ) and trough levels in plasma were 5.32\u00b11.76 and 1.05\u00b10.59 mg/L respectively. In BS, a mean C max of 3.11\u00b11.27 mg/L was achieved in 3\u00b11.03 hours and the penetration ratio was 1.17\u00b10.61. Thirteen patients demonstrated penetration equal to or even more than 100%. The PD target of AUC 0\u219224 /MIC 125 in plasma, that has been shown to be predictive of efficacy for Gram-negative infections, was attained in all patients and in the majority of them (74%) at MICs of 0.125 and 0.25 mg/ml respectively but in only 3 patients and in none at higher MICs (0.5 and 1 mg/ml). Slightly better results were obtained for the PD threshold of C max /MIC 10. Conclusions: CIP exhibits excellent penetration into BS. There is wide interindividual variability in its PK parameters in critically ill COPD patients and inadequate PD exposure against bacteria with MICs 0.5 mg/ml. Our data confirm the need for combination therapy against pathogens with high MICs such as Ps. aeruginosa, as well as the institution of therapeutic drug monitoring for individualizing antimicrobial dosing in order to optimize the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in the ICU.",

This is usually not a problem for acute infections since the bacteria are readily obtained by swapping or sampling the infected area. For chronic infections it is usually more problematic. An exception is cystic fibrosis (CF) in which the easy accessible purulent sputum coughed up by the patients on a regular basis harbor the bacteria. For the other chronic infections routine sampling has been either using a swab, a scrape or a biopsy, however all might fail to sample the bacteria. In a chronic wound the swab will only collect bacteria on the surface not the bacteria embedded in the wound bed. On the other hand, since the bacteria are very heterogeneously distributed chances are that a biopsy fails to contain any bacteria. Also for implant and catheter related infection diagnosing the bacteria prove difficult. Five to 10 years ago the bacteria on these surfaces and biofilm in general were considered unculturable. Here the problem is surface adherence, the bacteria simply attach extremely well to the surface of the foreign bodies. It is not that they are unculturable, they have to be released from the surface, and vigorously vortexing or even mechanical scraping is not enough. The implant or catheter has to be treated with ultra sound (sonication) to release the bacteria. The problems of diagnosing the bacteria in these chronic infections are far from solved. Today bacteria can be detected by: culturing, PCR, microscopy or diagnostic imaging. Each method has its advantages and limitations. For culturing, the problem is to collect the bacteria, either next to the surface, which is sampled, or from the catheter or implant. PCR will detect even tiny amounts of available DNA or RNA available in the sample. Additionally, just because a bacterium is present does not necessarily indicate that it contributes to the pathogenesis of the infection. Microscopy such as Gram-staining or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) enables direct visualization of the infecting bacteria and the surrounding tissue and inflammatory cells. Again the bacteria need to be present in the collected sample, which means many biopsies need to be analyzed for a correct diagnostics of e.g. a wound. On the other hand if only a few bacteria are present they might be very hard and statistically impossible to observe using traditional staining such as Gram.",

The drug of choice for streptococcal infections treatment still remains penicillin. In fact, the ability of penicillin and its related antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin) to kill group A streptococci has not changed in more than 50 years and, to date, there has never been a report on a group A streptococcus resistant to this class of antibiotics. On the other hand, macrolide resistance has been showing an increasing trend, with resistance rates which vary considerably in different countries, reaching up to almost 30% in some part of Europe. Effective treatment is of utmost importance, even for streptococcal pharyngitis, as it is primarily aimed at preventing non-suppurative and suppurative complications and decreasing infectivity. Even if not frequently, S. pyogenes infections may fail to respond to antibiotic therapy leading to persistent throat carriage and recurrent infections. Such failures cannot always be explained with the occurrence of antibiotic resistance determinants. It was first suggested that erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes may escape antimicrobial treatment and the host immune response through invasion of epithelial cells. Later, as GAS have recently been shown to be able to form biofilm, and being such character known to provide organisms with an improved antibiotic resistance besides supporting colonization and persistence, biofilm has been suggested as possibly responsible for unexplained treatment failures and recurrences due to susceptible microorganisms. Preliminary data have shown that biofilm may be produced, and/or upregulated, in S. pyogenes in response to either antibiotic treatment, other therapeutic molecules or environmental stimuli. In particular, subMIC antibiotic concentrations appear to stimulate biofilm formation; such phenomenon is being observed with increasing frequency for a number of microorganisms, both for biofilm and other virulence factors. The latest findings on what it is known on biofilm produced by S. pyogenes, its possible role in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections, and on the interactions between antibiotics and other therapeutic molecules and streptococcal biofilm, will be examined.",

Unfortunately, a complete and lasting equilibration between blood and tissue cannot always be taken for granted. Drug distribution processes may be characterized by a high intertissue-and intersubject variability and target site drug levels may substantially differ from corresponding plasma levels. Suboptimal target site concentrations may have important clinical implications, as it is a potential explanation for therapeutic failures. In particular for antimicrobial agents knowledge of drug tissue distribution is of primal importance as tissue drug exposure has been shown to be directly related to outcome of therapy. Therefore, determination of drug tissue penetration plays an important role in antimicrobial drug development. Positron emission tomography (PET) is nuclear imaging method, which can be used to study the tissue distribution of drugs labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides, such as carbon-11 or fluorine-18, non-invasively. These types of studies have been termed PET-microdosing studies, as the amount of drug administered in a PET study is usually less than 100 microgram. Due to low administered drug doses, the potential toxicological risk to human subjects is very limited. Consequently regulatory authorities require reduced preclinical safety testing as compared to conventional phase 1 studies. In the present talk, recent applications of PET-microdosing in antimicrobial drug development will be reviewed.",

The preclinical PK assessment provides the input for in vitro and in vivo PK/PD (pharmacodynamic) models that evaluate exposure-effect relationships. Such PK/PD models are powerful tools for dose selection for the clinical phases of drug development. If phase 1 PK data are available, population based PK/PD models support effectively dose selection for late stage clinical trials. Moreover, a PK/PD guided approach can provide decision support for susceptibility breakpoints as well as strategies to mitigate resistance development.

            "text": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in immune suppressed transplant recipients is a frequent and potential life-threatening complication. EBV causes B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, collectively named PTLD, which may lead to malignant lymphoma if left untreated. The incidence, clinical appearance and severity of PTLD may be quite variable, requiring appropriate risk-stratification at onset and accurate and standardized diagnostic monitoring approaches in the post-transplant period aiming at early identification of EBV involvement and distinction from rejection and other (infectious) complications. The biology and pathogenesis underlying PTLD in solid organ (SOT) and stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients has different features, with implications for diagnosis and treatment. Primary infection in the SOT and nearly all (re)active EBV infections in SCT pose the highest risk for fatal complications. A distinction should be made between early and late-onset PTLD, the former being directly EBV driven and frequently reversible by simple therapeutic intervention. The latter should be seen as a consequence of misdiagnosed early EBV-driven B-cell amplification, allowing additional genetic defects to accumulate, thereby increasing the malignant phenotype, which frequently require more severe intervention strategies, including chemotherapy. Early PTLD can be recognized by dynamic increases of EBV-DNA load in blood over relatively short time intervals. In SOT this EBV load is usually cell associated, whereas in SCT both cell and plasma DNA loads are observed. Whole blood may be a preferred well standardized sample for diagnostic monitoring. Dependent on the type of transplant, therapeutic intervention may vary from a (mild-moderate) reduction of immunosuppressive treatment (IST), via use of Rituximab (rtX) to infusion of ex vivo activated EBV-reactive T-cells. A persistent decrease of EBV-DNA load may be taken as a sign of therapeutic efficacy, and monitoring EBV-reactive T-cells by tetramer FACS or ELISPOT tests may provide information on patient's immune capacity to conquer EBVdriven B-cell proliferation and restore EBV latency on the long term. Treatment failure is indicated by persistent increases of EBV-DNA over time, and should be taken as sign for more drastic intervention. During early PTLD EBV-infected cells frequently disseminate via the circulation, and thus becomes easily detectable, whereas late PTLD may be confined to tissue with little circulating cells. EBV transcription profiling has revealed differences EBV gene expression in biopsy material and circulating EBV-carrying cells in patients with early PTLD, suggesting transcription regulation in affected lymphoid tissues. Furthermore analysis of EBV gene expression in PTLD lesions at the single cell level, reveals heterogeneous EBV gene expression, reflecting more complex underlying pathogenic events rather than simple proliferation of latency-III (growth program) expressing B-cells. Infrequent measuring of EBV DNA loads is not considered a proper diagnostic approach, because mere EBV DNA levels may vary between patients. These generally have no clinical implication when being stable over time. It is suggested that frequent (weekly) measurement of changes in EBV-DNA load at early times post-transplant using sensitive and standardized techniques, coupled to appropriate and timely EBV loadguided therapeutic intervention may reduce and even prevent PTLD in the transplant setting.",

A few of these HAdV types (1, 2, 5 and 31) are clearly associated with infections of immunosuppressed patients as for example haematopoietic stem cell recipients. These HAdV types are not typical opportunistic agents but also cause less severe diseases in immunocompetent patients. HAdV can persist for several months to years after an acute infection even in immunocompetent hosts and are more prevalent in children than in adults. Complications due to HAdV in haematopoetic stem cell recipients may originate from HAdV persistence and de novo infections. Due to HAdV persistence, diagnosis of HAdV disease cannot be made by mere detection of HAdV DNA. In case of organ related HAdV diseases, diagnosis is feasible by HAdV detection at the putative infection site, e.g. in case of cystitis by HAdV detection in urine. HAdV infection can also lead to potentially fatal disseminated HAdV disease. Main risk factors are young age, lymphopenia, T cell depletion and high dosage of immunosuppressive drugs. Diagnosis of the disseminated HAdV disease has been simplified by HAdV load testing in peripheral blood samples using quantitative HAdV PCR. High virus loads (>1e6 genome equivalents/ml) were clearly associated with disseminated disease whereas low virus loads (<1e4 genome equivalents/ml) can be observed in case of HAdV latency. However, a precise threshold HAdV load value has not yet been determined. Disseminated disease may be predicted in case of rapidly rising HAdV loads in blood. Pathophysiology of HAdV disseminated disease includes massive virus replication in affected organs as for example the liver which may be infected by interaction of HAdV capsids with clotting factor X. Furthermore binding of HAdV capsids to platelets, formation of immune complexes with preformed HAdV specific antibodies as well as induction of cytokines may contribute to the pathophysiology of disseminated HAdV disease. An antiviral treatment for HAdV disease has not yet been established.",

            "text": "Identification of microbial isolates by MALDI-TOF MS of whole cells gains more and more acceptance in clinical microbiology. The reliability of this technology depends largely on the reference database and the algorithm for spectral comparison. Most simply, a sample's spectrum is directly compared to spectra of reference strains and as a result a rated list of matches is provided. A more elaborate approach is realized in the (Spectral Archive and Microbial Identification System (SARAMIS). SARAMIS uses a comprehensive database of mass spectral data of reference strains for automated identification. Two types of spectral data are contained in the database: so called SuperSpectra for fully automated first-line identification (including result transmission) and Reference Spectra for semi-automated second-line identification. The concept of SuperSpectra has been developed in consideration of the natural, intra-specific diversity encountered in all microbial species. This diversity is also reflected in mass spectral fingerprints of individual isolates as variations in peak patterns, which complicates the selection of appropriate reference data. To compute SuperSpectra, spectral fingerprints of a number of 10\u221220 isolates of a species are searched for conserved mass signals that are summarized in a consensus spectrum. In a second step, each mass in the consensus spectrum is compared to the entire reference database to establish its specificity at different taxonomic levels. By doing so, mass signals can be selected that are specific at a desired taxonomic level, e.g., species-specific. By excluding masses from the consensus spectra that are specific only at higher taxonomic levels, the pattern of the remaining masses is highly specific. This makes random matches highly improbable, practically excluding false identifications. The SARAMIS database contains at present 2700 SuperSpectra, representing 900 microbial species. Since SuperSpectra by definition represent typical isolates of a species (not to be confused with type strains), a certain percentage of isolates of a given species will not be captured in automated routine analysis. In this case, the second-line identification starts that applies a direct comparison to all 35,000+ Reference Spectra in the database (representing 1500 species). By this two-step approach basically all clinically, most veterinary and, increasingly, environmental isolates can be reliably identified by a largely automated procedure.",

Results: A total of 3,695 isolates (1,095 from blood, 2,600 from urine) were included. 71.8% of the isolates showed fully agreement on specieslevel, for another 9.7% fully agreement on genus-level was achieved. 15.7% of the isolates could not be identified by MALDI-TOF using the 95% identification-score.

Fast and accurate species identification of microorganisms after signalling of growth is of fundamental interest. Currently, the identification takes up to two days because of the necessity for sub-cultivation and biochemical identification. The presented simple protocol has the potential to shorten the identification time to minutes. Methods: Blood cultures spiked with bacteria or yeast were used for method establishment, inoculated blood cultures and routine samples to optimize and validate the protocol. 1ml of a blood culture was mixed with 200ml of lysis solution followed by vortexing and centrifugation. Thereby, blood cells were disrupted but bacteria and yeast survived. Supernatant was removed and the pellet carefully suspended in wash solution. After centrifugation supernatant was removed and bacteria from the pellet were transferred to a MALDI target directly or after a short extraction procedure. Species ID was achieved by measurement in a MALDI-TOF MS mass spectrometer followed by analysis with the MALDI Biotyper software. The method was optimized by varying volumes and ratios of blood culture liquid and lysis solution. Results: Positive blood cultures showed an average cell density of about 10 7 cfu/ml and a high number of blood cells. The presented protocol was able to remove blood cells extensively without significant loss of microorganisms. Therefore, resulting MALDI-TOF spectra were of high quality. Different bacterial species (enterobacteria, Gram negative non-fermenting bacteria, staphylococci, enterococci, streptococci, Haemophilus sp.) could be identified with the procedure, reliably. Also yeasts which could not be detected with previously published protocols were identified. In some cases an identification was possible even 1\u22122 h before blood cultures were flagged positive by the automate, showing the high sensitivity of the method. Mixed cultures in most cases lead to non-identification or observation of only one species. Work on bioinformatic algorithms will improve this.",

Rapid identification of etiological agent of such severe infections is pivotal to guide antimicrobial therapy. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) allows the identification at the species level in few minutes of bacteria by measuring molecular masses of proteins from whole bacterial extracts. We applied a simple procedure for lysing erythrocytes from positive blood cultures and prepared a bacterial pellet for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Methods: Pellets from positive blood culture vials detected by Bactec 9240 (Becton Dickinson) were prepared by using an ammonium chloride lysing solution and centrifugation steps. Pellets were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF either by direct deposition on the target plate or after a formic acid:acetonitrile extraction step. Mass spectra were acquired using the Microflex MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics). The identification was considered as valid at the species level when the score value was >2, as valid at the genus level when the score value was >1.7 and <2 and as not valid when the score was <1.7. The identifications obtained with MALDI-TOF MS analysis were compared with biochemical identification. Results: 122 monobacterial positive blood vials from 76 patients were analyzed. 96 (78.7%) bacterial identifications were obtained by MALDI-TOF MS analysis, of which 69 (56.6% of 122) exhibited a score value >2 and 27 (22.1%) a score value >1.7 and <2. Regardless of the score value, 95 (98.95%) of the 96 bacterial identification obtained with MALDI-TOF MS were correct at the species level and 1 correct at the genus level only. In 26 (21.3%) of cases, no reliable identification was obtained (score value <1.7). 21/26 bacteria (80.8%) were Gram positive, mainly streptococci (n = 13) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 5). Most unidentified streptococci were Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among the 5 Gram negative bacteria with a score <1.7, 4 were of encapsulated species (2 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2 Haemophilus influenzae). Conclusion: The use of an ammonium chloride-driven hemolysis before analyzing directly positive blood cultures by MALDI-TOF MS is a very promising new method allowing fast, accurate and inexpensive identification of the etiological agents of life-threatening bloodstream infections.",

After incubation, 500 ml aliquots from the positive vials were pipetted onto a 100 ml Ficoll-Paque Plus cushion and centrifuged (5 min at 15000 g in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf cup). Supernatant was discarded and part of the pellet transferred onto a MALDI target, air dried, overlayed with matrix solution (HCCA), again air dried and subjected to identification by mass spectrometry using the MBT system. This approach was compared to our standard workflow: plating the urine on 2 Petri dishes in a quantitative way, MBT identification of colonies after over night incubation at 37\u00baC. Results: A bacterial count above 10E4 CFU was obtained for 77 of the 161 samples. These patients where considered to have a bacterial infection. The bacterial count was identical to a large extend with both methods. However, MBT identification was only possible in 63 of the samples incubated in the HB&L. Here, the results matched those of the standard protocol. This was due to the presence of more than one pathogen (as shown by the standard workup) which the current identification software of the MBT can not resolve. Conclusion: This protocol enables reliable bacterial identification together with a bacterial count in few more than 3 hours in cases of mono-bacterial infection using the standard protocol of the HB&L. Ongoing improvement to the MBT identification algorithms will resolve the problem of poly-bacterial infections. Further extension of this approach to usually sterile body fluids, tracheal secretions and pleural aspirates also here may lead to a dramatic reduction in turnaround time of microbiological labs for identification and subsequent AST-testing.",

The pellet was dried well and extracted using 35% formic acid/50% acetonitrile. 1ml of the extract was spotted onto a MALDI target, dried on air, and overlaid with HCCA matrix. Mass spectra were acquired in the linear mode, mass range 2000 to 20000 Da, using a microflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen). Spectra were analysed using the flexAnalysis software, reference libraries were created and bioinformatic analyses were performed with the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 software (Bruker Daltonik).

These samples facilitated a successful protein extraction by a simple, short standardised method. Mass spectra generated based on the novel sample preparation method were reproducible and contained many characteristic peaks, thereby leading to a significantly improved identification security. Further, the higher quality of spectra increased the differentiation power of the method and could highlight subspecies differences.

All isolates were also identified by Phoenix TM automated microbiology system (BD Diagnostic Systems, USA) as well as by MALDI Biotyper technique (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany) which is based on fingerprinting of mass spectra acquired from fresh bacterial cultures. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed as confirmatory approach for discordant cases. Results: Clinical isolates from 31 regions of the Russian Federation were investigated including 101 isolates presumably identified by conventional microbiological methods as coagulase-negative staphylococci and 200 isolates reported as S. aureus. A discordance between conventional methods of identification and the other tested technologies was found in 9 (2.9%) cases for MALDI Biotyper technique, and in 29 (9.6%) ones for BD Phoenix TM automated system.

The Biotyper 2.0 software generates a list of species matches ranked by a log score value. In this study we accepted the score value of 1.7 and higher if the duplicates matched each other. Results:36 different anaerobic species were identified. Proportion of isolates identified correctly according to species group compared to 16s rDNA sequencing are presented in table 1. Generally MALDI-TOF MS performed better than the 2 automated systems, although short comings were present for some species. Of the two automated systems the VITEK2 Anaerobic and Corynebacteria identification card performed marginally better than the BD BBL Crystal TM Anaerobe ID kit. Conclusion: The automated systems for anaerobic identification show limited performances. Although the MALDI-TOF MS performed better, significant shortcomings are also present. The latter could be explained by database limitations of the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 software, i.e. several subspecies of Fusobacterium nucleatum have been described but are not included. At present time 16s rDNA sequencing remains the gold standard but may be somewhat replaced by MALDI TOF MS in the near future depending on further development of the database. The 2 automated identification systems can be used in adjunction to more conventional identification. Objective: Despite the identification of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats in China, the evolutionary and possible recombination origin of SARS-CoV remains undetermined. To better define the epidemiology and evolution of bat-SARS-CoV in China and their role as recombination origin of SARS-CoV in civet, a four-year study on coronaviruses in Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong and Guangdong province of southern China was conducted. Methods: Respiratory and alimentary samples were collected from 1401 Chinese horseshoe bats captured in Hong Kong and Guangdong province of southern China over a four-year period and were detected for coronaviruses by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Five hundred and eleven bats from Hong Kong were also tagged to study the migration pattern of bats and viral persistence. The complete genomes of 10 strains of bat-SARS-CoV obtained at different time were sequenced and compared to the previously characterized genomes.",

Bats carrying the viruses appeared healthy, with viral clearance occurring between two weeks to four months. Tagging exercise showed that migration distances of Chinese horseshoe bats in Hong Kong range from 1.86 to 17 km. Complete genome sequencing of 10 strains of bat-SARS-CoV revealed frequent recombination between different strains, especially among the bat viruses in China. Recombination was detected between bat-SARS-CoV Rp3 from Guangxi and Rf1 from Hubei in the possible generation of civet SARS-CoV SZ3, with breakpoint at nsp16/spike region. Conclusion: Bat-SARS-CoV causes acute, self-limiting infection in horseshoe bats which serve as reservoir for recombination between virus strains from different geographical locations within reachable foraging range. Civet SARS-CoV is likely a recombinant virus arising from bat-SARS-CoV strains closely related to Rp3 and Rf1. Such frequent recombination in these animals may have accounted for the cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS.",

            "text": "O544 Epidemiology and control of Q fever in the Netherlands, 2007 -2009 Objectives: Q fever is caused by Coxiella burnetii. Sheep and goats are frequently described as the source. Humans are usually infected through inhalation and half of the infected show symptoms. Before 2007, Q fever was a rare disease in the Netherlands. Since 2005, Q fever emerged in small ruminants and subsequently in 2007 in the human population leading to the largest Q fever outbreak recorded up to date. Methods: Analysis of data from public health facilities, regional laboratories, the Animal Health Service and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment to describe the Q fever outbreak occurring in the Netherlands. Results: In the spring of 2007, Q fever occurred in a village in the province of Noord Brabant with 168 cases. In 2008 and 2009 increasingly larger outbreaks occurred in an increasingly wider area. By November 2009, more than 3000 cases have been notified. Six patients have died. The number of chronic cases is not known. So far, contact with hay/manure and a house location close to an infected dairy goat farm have been identified as important risk factors for human Q fever. In the affected area dairy goat farming is common and goat density per square kilometre is the highest in the Netherlands. Since 2005 and preceding the human outbreaks, abortion waves caused by C. burnetii have been noticed on 27 dairy goat farms and 2 dairy sheep farms in the regions where most of the human cases occurred. Sampling of incriminated farms, animals and surroundings resulted in detection of C. burnetii. Preliminary MLVA analysis points at spreading of a single clone in goats, however the presence of this clone is not yet widely confirmed in humans. Control measures including mandatory veterinary notification as well as hygiene measures during spread of manure, lambing season and mass vaccination of goats and sheep are being implemented. Preliminary results of the monitoring of vaccination indicate a decrease of the abortion rate in the vaccinated groups to zero and a drop in bulkmilk levels of C. burnetii DNA. Conclusion: The Q fever outbreak starting in 2007 in the Netherlands is still on going. It is mainly restricted to the south of the country in an area with intense dairy goat farming. However the epidemic has been expanding to other areas in 2009. The effect of control measures is still to be awaited. Epidemiological data point towards the intensive dairy goat farming as the main source of the outbreak. Objectives: An outbreak of Q-fever with over 3300 notified cases is ongoing in the Netherlands. Since 2007, immunofluorescence assay (IFA) has been the cornerstone of Q-fever serology in our hospital. IFA, however, is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability.

Eckburg\u00b0, H.D. Friedland, J. Lee, L. Llorens, I. Critchley, D. Thye (Oakland, US) Objectives: Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common pathogen and there are growing concerns about the rising incidence of resistant or highly virulent pathogens, such as multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae (MDRSP) and community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Ceftaroline (CPT), a novel, parenteral, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against common Gram-positive organisms, including MDRSP and MRSA, as well as common Gram-negative pathogens, was evaluated for the treatment of CABP (Clinical Trials ID NCT00509106). Methods: Hospitalized adult patients from 84 centres in 14 countries with moderate to severe CABP (PORT Risk Class III or IV) requiring intravenous therapy received CPT 600 mg q12 h or ceftriaxone (CRO)1 g q24 h for 5 to 7 days (randomized 1:1). Clinical and microbiological responses and adverse events (AEs) were assessed. The primary objective was to determine non-inferiority (pre-specified CI margin of \u221210%) in clinical cure rate of CPT compared with CRO at the test-of-cure visit (8 to 15 days post-therapy) in the clinically evaluable (CE) and modified intent-to-treat efficacy (MITTE) populations. Secondary objectives included evaluation of clinical cure in the microbiologically evaluable (ME) and microbiological modified intent-to-treat efficacy (mMITTE) populations. Table. Both CPT and CRO were well tolerated; most common AEs for CPT were diarrhoea (3.8% vs 2.9% for CRO), headache (3.5% vs 1.6%), and insomnia (3.2% vs 2.6%). AEs led to study drug discontinuation in 5.1% and 4.2% of patients treated with CPT and CRO, respectively. Conclusions: CPT demonstrated non-inferiority to ceftriaxone in treating patients hospitalized with moderate to severe CABP in the CE and MITTE study populations of FOCUS 2. Clinical cure rates in the 2 co-primary populations and in patients with a confirmed bacterial infection were numerically higher for CPT compared with CRO. CPT had high clinical cure rates and was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to ceftriaxone. CPT has the potential to be an effective, welltolerated treatment option for CABP.",

This is in keeping with observations that PPV is incompletely protective against IPD. Of the 23 isolates serotyped, 14 (61%) were covered by PPV but not PCV7.

            "text": "In a prospective, observational study in 22 Dutch hospitals, patients ( 18years) admitted to the ER with a clinically suspected CAP were included between January 2008 and March 2009. Recent hospitalization (<2 wks), stay in long-term care facilities, known bronchial obstruction or a history of post-obstructive pneumonia, primary or metastatic lung cancer, AIDS/ PCP/ TBC and unconsciousness were exclusion criteria. History taking, physical examination, biochemical and hematological blood testing, blood-and sputum cultures and BINAX pneumococcal urinary antigen testing were performed in all patients. All pneumococcal bacteremia isolates were serotyped (at the Netherlands Reference Laboratory Amsterdam). Pneumococcal CAP was defined on the presence of clinical criteria for CAP, radiographic confirmation by a radiologist and isolation of S. pneumoniae from blood or sputum (if dominant flora) or positive antigen testing in urine. Results: Of 1631 included patients, 1115 had radiographically confirmed CAP and 210 (18.8%) had pneumococcal CAP, diagnosed on isolation of S. pneumoniae from blood culture (n = 82, 7.3% of all bloodcultures), sputum culture (n = 24), or positive urinary antigen test (n = 151). 75 bacteremia isolates were serotyped. Serotypes 14 (n = 9), 1, 7F, 19A and 22F (n = 8) were most common. Potential vaccine coverage was 28% for the 7-valent, 67% for the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and 93% for 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PS). Conclusion: Based on bacteremia isolates vaccine coverage would be 67% with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that is currently investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in the Netherlands.

Henriques Normark (Stockholm, SE) Objectives: To investigate pneumococcal serotype-specific mortality risk correlated to the serotype invasive disease potential among patients with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Methods: In Sweden it is mandatory to report IPD and isolates are collected for serotyping and molecular typing. Of 4195 episodes of IPD among adults reported between Jan 2007 to Oct 2009 a total of 3692 isolates were serotyped (88%). A questionnaire study was performed to obtain clinical and socio-demographic information about patients with serotyped IPD [obtained for 1657/3692 patients (45%)]. In a preliminary analysis of the 1657 patients we assessed the absolute serotype-specific 30-day mortality risks and relative risks using regression modeling on group level according to previously defined invasive disease potential [high (serotypes 1 and 7), medium (serotypes 4, 9, 14 and 18) and low (serotypes 3, 6A, 6B, 8, 15, 19, 33 and 38) and for individual serotypes. Risk estimates were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Pneumococcal serotype prevalence ranged from 0.05% for serotype 5 to 13.4% for serotype 14 and was stable over the observed period. Absolute mortality risk was highest for serotypes with low invasive disease potential (12.8%) followed by serotypes with medium-(8.6%) and high (4.9%) invasive disease potential. Serotypes with low invasive disease potential were associated with increased mortality risk in unadjusted but not adjusted analyses [relative risks 2.62 (95% CI 1.38-5.00) and 1.61 (95% CI 0.84-3.09) respectively] and a test for trend according to invasive disease potential was significant in unadjusted (p-value: 0.001) but not adjusted (p-value: 0.10) analyses. Patients infected with serotypes of lower invasive disease potential were older, more likely to be diagnosed with meningitis, suffer from chronic disease and immunosuppression (all p-values <0.003). Serotype 3, 6B, 11A, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F were associated with increased mortality risk in crude analyses but only serotype 6B and 11A were associated with increased mortality risk in adjusted analyses.",

Ho (Taipei, TW)    Objective: Polyomavirus-associated allograft nephropathy(PVAN)   frequently results in allograft dysfunction in renal transplant patients in the era of powerful immunosuppressive agents. BK virus (BKV) is the dominant causal agent whilst JC virus (JCV) accounts for the rest. Although renal biopsy is considered as the diagnostic standard for PVAN, a less invasive surrogate method is helpful. This study evaluated the clinical utility of urinary decoy cells and urine and plasma BKV/JCV real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the diagnosis of PVAN in renal transplant recipients with allograft dysfunction. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, 22 renal transplant patients with allograft dysfunction and with renal biopsy results were evaluated. All patients received real-time PCR assays for BKV and JCV for their plasma and urine samples within one week of renal biopsy. The biopsy results included 7 renal-allograft recipients with pathological diagnosis of PVAN (5 BKV-and 2 JCV-associated) and 15 patients with pathological diagnosis other than PVAN. Urine cytology was evaluated for decoy cells within 1 week of renal biopsy in all patients. Results: In the 7 PVAN patients, exclusive BKV viruria was detected in all patients with BKV-associated PVAN and exclusive JCV viruria was detected in 2 patients with JCV-associated PVAN. BKV viremia exceeded the cut-off threshold value (10 4 copies/ml) was found in all 5 BKV-associated PVAN patients. JCV viremia was found in one JCVassociated PVAN patient. The use of decoy cells as a marker of PVAN had a sensitivity of 85.7% and negative predictive value of 93%. The use of polyomavirus viruria in aiding the diagnosis of PVAN had a sensitivity of 100% and negative predictive value of 100%. The use of polyomavirus viremia in aiding the diagnosis of PVAN had a specificity of 93.3% and positive predictive value of 85.7%. Conclusions: BKV and JCV real-time PCR methods may help in the diagnosis of PVAN among renal transplant patients. BKV viremia (>10 4 copies/ml) is highly associated with BKV nephropathy whilst the cut-off value for JCV requires further investigation.O246 Norovirus-related severe and chronic diarrhoea in renal transplant adult recipients D.

Zuber (Paris, Dijon, FR) Objectives: Noroviruses (NoV) and Sapoviruses (SpV) are two separate genera in the Caliciviridae family. NoV are an increasingly recognized cause of transient gastroenteritis in immunocompetent individuals and have been recently implicated in chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised patients. However, clinical and epidemiological spectrum of Caliciviridae infections in renal transplant recipients is still poorly defined. Methods: We undertook a single-center retrospective analysis of the clinical and virologic features of Caliciviridae infection, diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from July 2008 to September 2009. Genotypes and variants were identified by genome sequencing. Other infectious agents were ruled out.",

Other CTX-M variants have been amplified locally, such as CTX-M-9 and CTX-M-14 in Portugal and Spain, CTX-M-3 in eastern countries associated to specific plasmid families. TEM-52 and CTX-M-1 disseminated prevalently on IncI1 plasmids among E. coli of human and animal origin.

Deplano, C. Nonhoff, R. De Ryck, R. De Mendon\u00e7a, M.J. Struelens (Anderlecht, BE; Stockholm, SE) Objectives: Healthcare-associated strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) are endemic in Belgian hospitals for two decades. Recently, PVL-positive community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) and livestock-associated MRSA ST398 strains (LA-MRSA) have been identified in Belgium. We determined the relative frequency of MRSA strains by genotype in patients in acute-care hospitals as part of an ongoing surveillance program since 1995. Methods: All hospitals were invited to collect three consecutive, nonduplicate MRSA isolates from hospitalised patients in 2005 and 2008 (five isolates in 2003). MRSA were confirmed by PCR for nuc and mecA genes and genotyped by spa-and SCCmec-type. MLST was performed on a subset of strains (n = 20). Results: Of MRSA isolates from 315 patients in 109 hospitals, 53% were detected on admission or 48 hours after admission, compared to 36% in 2005 and 2003. Five PVL-positive strains (1.6%) of ST80-SCCmec IV (n = 4) and ST5-SCCmec IV (n = 1) were detected. PVLpositive MRSA represented 1.2% and 0.2% of MRSA from hospitalised patients in surveys of 2005 and 2003, respectively. Two patients with LA-MRSA ST398 (0.6%), showing spa-type t011, were identified. LA-MRSA isolates were found in 0.9% and 0.4% of MRSA in 2005 and 2003, respectively. Conclusion: The proportion of patients with MRSA that are imported in hospitals was over fifty percent in Belgium in 2008.

Florquin, P.P. Nawroth, A. Bierhaus, T. van der Poll (Utrecht,  Amsterdam, NL; Heidelberg, DE)    Objective: The development of active tuberculosis after infection with Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis is almost invariably caused by a persistent or transient state of relative immunodeficiency. Multidrugresistant strains are on the rise and the frequent occurrence of coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus makes the treatment and outcome of tuberculosis even more worrisome. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a promiscuous receptor that is involved in pulmonary inflammation and infection. We here aimed to investigate the role of RAGE in tuberculosis. Methods: RAGE deficient (RAGE\u2212/\u2212) and normal wild-type (Wt) mice were intranasally inoculated with live virulent M. tuberculosis.Results: While lungs of infected Wt mice expressed RAGE, in particular on endothelium, M. tuberculosis pneumonia was associated with an enhanced expression of pulmonary RAGE. Lung inflammation was increased in RAGE\u2212/\u2212 mice, as indicated by histopathology, percentage of inflamed area, lung weight and cytokine and chemokine levels. In addition, lung lymphocyte and neutrophil numbers were increased in the RAGE\u2212/\u2212 mice. RAGE\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed higher mycobacterial loads in the lungs after 3 weeks of infection, while they showed similar loads S84 20th ECCMID, Oral presentations in the liver at 3 and 6 weeks. Finally, RAGE\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed body weight loss and a worsened M. tuberculosis induced mortality(Figure). Conclusion: These data suggest that RAGE plays a beneficial role in the host response to pulmonary tuberculosis.O371Imipenem or meropenem plus clavulanate combination improves survival of mice infected with M. tuberculosis N. Veziris\u00b0, C. Truffot, J. Mainardi, V. Jarlier (Paris, FR) Background: Due to the emergence of extensively drug resistant strains (XDR) of M. tuberculosis, new antituberculous agents are desperately needed. Although b-lactam antibiotics are not considered as antituberculous drugs, it has been recently shown in vitro that the combination of meropenem and clavulanate has synergic activity against M. tuberculosis. Objectives: We wished to evaluate in the murine model of tuberculosis the activity of penems alone and combined with clavulanate against M. tuberculosis.

Novak\u00b0(Vienna, AT)    Background: BC-3781 and BC-3205 are two new antimicrobial agents of the pleuromutilin class, which are both in an early stage of clinical development for intravenous and/or oral treatment of skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). BC-3781 and BC-3205 exhibit excellent antimicrobial activity against a range of relevant bacteria frequently identified in SSSI and CAP including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Invasive severe infections caused by MRSA, particularly those involving persistent bacteraemia and necrotizing pneumonia are associated with high mortality. Since treatment with currently available antibiotics is often unsatisfactory novel antibacterials with improved efficacy against severe MRSA infections are urgently needed. Methods: Murine pulmonary infections caused by MRSA were established in neutropenic female BALB/c mice. Mice were grouped (n = 6) and subcutaneous therapy using BC-3781, BC-3205, linezolid or vancomycin started 2 h post infection (1.5\u00d710 7 ) with a single dose and continued for two days with a bid dosing regimen. Lungs of mice were dissected on day 3 after start of infection. The bacterial burden in pulmonary tissues was determined using standard plating techniques. Untreated animals died on day 2. An Emax dose response model was used to obtain the bacteriostatic dose levels and the maximum killing potency of all tested compounds. Results: BC-3781 and BC-3205 showed excellent efficacy with a reduction of 3\u22124 log10 CFU/lung being achieved with doses of 160 mg/kg BC-3205 and BC-3781, respectively. For the same reduction of viable MRSA in lungs a dose of 240 mg/kg/day linezolid was required. The maximum killing potency of vancomycin was only~1.3 log10 CFU/lung at a dose of 480 mg. BC-3781 and BC-3205 ensured 100% survival already at daily doses greater than 20 and 40 mg/kg, respectively. Doses of >60 mg/kg/day linezolid and >240 mg/kg/day vancomycin, were needed for 100% survival. Conclusions: Both compounds, BC-3205 and BC-3781, demonstrated excellent efficacy in a murine pulmonary infection caused by MRSA. Both compounds, BC-3781 and BC-3205, showed superior efficacy compared to the standard of care antibiotics linezolid and vancomycin.O376 BAL30072, a new sulfactam with excellent in vitroand in vivo activity against Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum b-lactamases S.Navon-Venezia\u00b0, O.

This policy banned the use of cephalosporin and quinolone antibiotics unless released by the microbiologist. Hospital pharmacists upheld the policy on the wards and stocks of restricted agents were removed from all wards except intensive and emergency care. Methods: The policy was introduced following a brief educational campaign aimed at all doctors. From six months before, until 14 months after the policy began, we calculated the monthly consumption of all antibiotic classes in defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 patient-occupied bed-days (1000 pt bds) for the whole hospital.Conclusion: A restrictive antibiotic policy had a profound effect on the number of cases of hospital-acquired C. difficile (reduction of 40%), less effect on ESBLs (reduction of 23%) and little effect on MRSA (7% reduction). Whilst it is important to reduce antibiotic consumption as far as possible, it is clear that additional infection control interventions are required for hospital-acquired infection, particularly MRSA.

Vandenesch for the French AEPEI Study Group on infective endocarditis Background: The changing epidemiology of staphylococci worldwide, with the emergence of community-acquired MRSA called for a thorough analysis of the S. aureus isolated during the French national survey on infective endocarditis (IE) conducted in 2008. Methods: We analyzed 131 non-duplicate staphylococcal isolates collected during the 2008 IE French survey. Genomic identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing and search for mecA gene were performed. MRSA strains were subjected to population analysis for determination of glycopeptide heteroresistance. All S. aureus were spatyped and 114 MSSA were analyzed by a DNA microarray covering 185 distinct genes (300 alleles), including genes encoding virulence factors and resistance genes. Results: MRSA: 17 MRSA (13%) belonging to only 5 spa-types and 3 sequence-types (ST) were detected demonstrating a high clonality. They were frequently resistant to levofloxacin (88%), kanamycin and tobramycin (47%), and to erythromycin (35%). Four of the MRSA were categorized as hVISA by population analysis. No strain belongs to any CA-MRSA clone. MSSA: The 114 MSSA isolates were seldom resistant to erythromycin (16/114, 1.4%) and almost fully susceptible to all other antibiotics. Phenotypic results were highly correlated with genomic data from microarray. All MSSA isolates were assigned to 19 ST. Their ST diversity evaluated by the lamba modified Simpson was not different when compared to a set of 114 S. aureus invasive isolates collected throughout France during the EARSS study in 2006-2007 (88.31% vs 91.09%). Surprisingly we noticed that 8 isolates belonged to ST398. Genomic DNA microarray comparison of the 114 MSSA IE isolates with 152 MSSA nasal carriage isolates highlighted that several specific determinants or gene alleles (e.g., bone sialoprotein, elastin binding protein, modulins) were preferentially harbored by MSSA IE isolates. Conclusions: The genetic diversity of S. aureus strains from IE suggests that there is no specific background strain associated with IE; however some virulence traits are highlighted; it remains to be determined whether some specific genetic traits of the human host favor the occurrence of S. aureus IE.

Positive samples were genotyped by use of a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)-ompA sequencing technique. Isolates were cultured from the positives where possible. Results: Of the 162 samples, 86 were fully typed by VNTR-ompA. Only one mixed infection (E & F) in one sample was confirmed. The commonest genotypes were D, E & F, comprising 20%, 45% and 15% of the genotyped positives respectively. Within each of these genovars there were multiple VNTR sub-types. 69 of the swabs yielded culturable isolates able to passage multiple times. Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive fine molecular epidemiology genetic typing survey of C. trachomatis in the UK. Amongst the common genotypes, there are a significant number of defined sub-types, which may reflect backgrounds of particular demographics relating to age group, geography, high-risk sexual behaviour, and sexual networks.

January-June 2009, newly admitted children were screened at admission and twice weekly. 51 ESBL-E. coli isolates were detected in 26 children, of which 6 later were found to carry isolates of several PFGE-types. The 51 isolates were typed by PFGE, multiple-locus-variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), a \"mini\" multiple-locus-sequence typing (mMLST) method (fumC, purA and dnaJ genes) and by Phene Plate (PhP) biochemical fingerprinting. MLVA generated the same strain differentiation profile as PFGE. mMLST accurately detected the same STs of PFGE-types as detected by standard MLST (http://mlst.ucc.ie/mlst/dbs/Ecoli), although it did not differentiate ST 131 isolates of different PFGE-types (A and C). PhPtyping differentiated isolates such that little correlation was observed with PFGE. By monitoring resistance patterns of isolates we could not predict the identity of isolates. Conclusion: If transmission is ongoing for an extended time period, several types of ESBL-producing bacteria may be detected in an outbreak and all isolates, including screened as well as repeat isolates, should be typed to identify affected patients. Only genetic methods gave satisfactory typing results in investigating this outbreak. MLVA generated identical results as those of PFGE and is, thus, attractive, being faster, less-costly and producing results that are easier to communicate.

Kluytmans, A. Troelstra, M. Bonten on behalf of the Dutch Rapid MRSA Diagnostics Study Group Objectives: The Dutch MRSA screening strategy requires sampling of multiple sites and with rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) conventional cultures are mandatory as back up. We determined cost-effectiveness of a less extensive screening regime using RDT without back up cultures in a prospective multi-center study. Methods: All patients at risk of MRSA colonization and fulfilling the criteria for pre-emptive isolation in 14 hospitals between 12/05 and 06/08 were eligible. In addition to conventional cultures, BD GeneOhmTM MRSA PCR ('IDI', BD Diagnostics) or the Xpert MRSA assay ('GeneXpert', Cepheid) was performed directly on patient material. In a nested cohort study the chromogenic agar MRSA-ID (bioM\u00e9rieux) was tested. Cost-efficacy is determined assuming isolation measures would have been based on single site testing of the nares without back up cultures. Isolation of MRSA at any site tested using broth enrichment culture was the gold standard. Results: 1764 patients (mean 48 years, 56% male) were enrolled. 3.3% carried MRSA: after hospitalization abroad 1.6% (20/1225), contact with pigs 15.0% (29/193) and contact screening related to MRSA positive patients 2.8% (8/289). The sensitivity of screening of the nares using IDI PCR, GeneXpert and MRSA-ID was 69.2%, 56.3% and 61.5%, respectively with negative predictive values >98.4% for all tests. Costs per patient tested were \u20ac56.62, \u20ac70.92 and \u20ac8.06 for IDI PCR, GeneXpert PCR and MRSA-ID, respectively. Isolation days avoided were 2.3%-5.2% higher with single site testing compared to multiple site testing because of higher specificity (and lower sensitivity). Test costs per isolation day avoided were \u20ac25.00, \u20ac34.48 and \u20ac4.91 for IDI PCR, GeneXpert PCR and MRSA-ID respectively. Although the recommended multiple site sampling strategy has a higher sensitivity than \"nares-only\" screening without back up cultures, our results demonstrate that in a low endemic setting the benefits of such a strategy are limited, and the costs are high. Financial consequences of the missed MRSA patients have to be determined to draw definite conclusions.

Barnett, J. Edgeworth, R. Batra, B.S. Cooper (London, UK; Brisbane, AU; Bangkok, TH) Objectives: To use transmission dynamic models to assess the costeffectiveness of defined screening and decolonisation strategies in the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methods: We developed a dynamic transmission model of MRSA in intensive care units (ICUs) to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening and topical decolonisation (both nasal ointment and body wash-based antiseptic protocol). The model was parameterized using evidence from multiple sources (data, literature and expert opinion) including full parameter uncertainty. Thirteen strategies were compared, including decolonisation of all admissions, decolonisation of patients identified as MRSA positive through screening (comparing conventional cultures, chromogenic agars and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques) and targeting interventions to high risk patients. Incremental costs and health benefits of the alternatives were evaluated under different settings of prevalence, proportion of high risk patients and ICU size. Results: Compared to a baseline strategy of decolonisation of clinical infections only, all other strategies were cost-saving and gave increased health benefits. Decolonisation of all patients was the most cost effective option, saving \u00a360,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. For screening, and decolonisation of identified MRSA positives, PCR had the greatest ability to reduce MRSA transmission (giving a 94% reduction in infections per 100 admissions, compared to 64% with conventional culture). Including parameter uncertainty, the best decision depended on the decision maker's willingness to pay for health benefits: at a value of \u00a320,000\u221230,000 per QALY, admission screening with PCR combined with decolonisation of identified positives was the best strategy. However, there was uncertainty in this decision, reflecting parameter uncertainty,",

Oliveira Filho (Caxias do Sul, BR)    Objective:In July 2009, a respiratory illness outbreak caused by influenza A virus (H1N1-2009) was identified in Caxias do Sul, Brazil. The aim of the study is to determine the impact of influenza A H1N1 2009 on the viral etiology of pneumonia among children admitted at General Hospital of Caxias do Sul from July 01 to August 31, 2009. Methods: Retrospective medical chart reviews on the pediatric hospitalized patients diagnosed with acute respiratory infection between July and August 2009. We evaluated demographic data, clinical and laboratory findings. Nasopharyngeal aspirates for detection of respiratory viruses were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) and realtime polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: A total of 53 children were hospitalized for severe acute respiratory disease, according to the criteria established by the Health Ministry of Brazil. Most patients were male (60.3%) and had less than one year of age (35.8% with less than 6 months and 26.4% between 6 and 12 months). Comorbidities were identified in 9.4%. Fifteen patients were referred for the intensive care unit, and one third of them required mechanical ventilation. No deaths occurred. Six patients (11.3%) had S49 confirmed influenza A (H1N1) and in 27 children (50.9%) were identified respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as the etiologic agent of pneumonia. Conclusion: As in previous years, respiratory syncytial virus has remained as predominant agent in the etiology of viral pneumonia in spite of the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) experienced in 2009. O216 Norovirus infection in hospitalized Australian children A. Kesson\u00b0, N. Benwell, E. Elliott (Westmead, Sydney, AU) Objective: Norovirus, previously the Norwalk agent, is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis. We determined the incidence and relative impact of norovirus in children with acute diarrhoea admitted to a tertiary paediatric hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Methods: Faecal samples were collected from children presenting to our Hospital with episodes of acute diarrheal illness over a 12 month period (2007). The viral pathogens, rotavirus and adenovirus were detected using immunochromatography and norovirus was detected using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results: During this 12 month period, faecal samples were collected from 3962 children who presented with diarrhoea to our Hospital and viral pathogens were detected in 294 of these children who required hospital admission. 231 of 294 (78.5%) children with gastroenteritis required a hospital stay of one week or less, median 1 day and 212 had a single viral stool pathogen detected of which 63 (30%) were norovirus, 56 (26%) were adenovirus and 93 (44%) were rotavirus. Dual viral infections were detected in 19 (8%). Norovirus infections most commonly presented in spring (September-November, with an October peak) in infants (age less than 12 months). Of the 63 patients with a hospital stay greater than one week, 28 (44%) had norovirus infection, 16 were non-oncology patients who developed nosocomial infection after admission for another condition. The 25 oncology patients were older and had a longer hospital stay (median 11 days) than non-oncology patients and 7 (28%) had nosocomial infection due to norovirus. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the impact of community-acquired norovirus gastroenteritis and the high frequency of nosocomial norovirus infection in a tertiary paediatric hospital. With the advent of rotavirus vaccination, norovirus may become the major viral pathogen causing gastroenteritis in Australian children. O217 Impact of rapid PCR detection of enteroviruses in spinal fluid in children with meningitis K.M. Huizing\u00b0, C.M. Swanink, A.M. Landstra, A.A. van Zwet, P.A. van Setten (Arnhem, NL) Objectives: We hypothesized in this study that the use of a rapid PCR on enteroviruses in spinal fluid significantly reduces the duration of hospitalization, and use of antibiotics. We expected that these reductions would lead to lowering of hospital costs. Methods: The study group comprises children admitted to the hospital from April 2009 until November 2009 with confirmed enterovirus meningitis. Since 2009 we performed the PCR on enteroviruses in spinal fluid in our hospital. The results are available within 3 hours. This study group was compared to a historical control group that consisted of children who were admitted in 2007 and 2008 with confirmed enterovirus meningitis. In the historical control group, results for enterovirus PCR tests were available after 3 to 7 days. We analyzed both groups for clinical and laboratory parameters, length of hospital stay, use of antibiotics and estimated overall costs. Results: The study group and historical control group were comparable with respect to clinical and laboratory data. A significant difference was found between the groups in length of hospital stay (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our data show that in children with enterovirus meningitis the use of a rapid PCR results in a significant reduction of hospital stay and duration of antibiotic treatment. Subsequently, it also leads to an important reduction of hospital costs. The rapid enterovirus PCR is an important diagnostic tool in daily management of children with meningitis. Early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is essential to prevent severe complications and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Objective: To develop a predictive model for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Methods: This case-control study was conducted in QSNICH, Bangkok. Data were derived from the medical records of 45 sepsis and 135 non-sepsis neonates for early sepsis, and 52 sepsis and 156 non-sepsis cases for late sepsis, during the period 1 October 2004\u221230 September 2007. Potential predictors consisted of risk factors, clinical conditions, laboratory data, and treatment modalities. The models were developed based on multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: The incidence of early and late proven neonatal sepsis was 1.27 and 1.46%, respectively. For early neonatal sepsis, the equation and score consisted of 5 variables: length of stay pre-sepsis, poor feeding, abnormal oxygen saturation (<92%), thrombocytopenia (<150,000/mm 3 ), and leucopenia (<5000/mm 3 ). For late neonatal sepsis, the model had 6 variables: poor feeding, abnormal heart rate (outside the range 100-180 x/min), abnormal temperature (outside the range 36-37.9\u00baC), abnormal oxygen saturation, abnormal leucocytes(according to Manroe's criteria by age), and abnormal pH (outside the range 7.27-7.45). The area below the ROC curve were 87.8 and 95.5% for early and late neonatal sepsis, respectively. Validation used subsets of the original data-set, twice for each model, and produced areas below the curve of 82.2 and 86.2% (for the early group) and 96.3 and 93.6% (for the late group). For early sepsis, score 1 had a sensitivity of 73.3% and specificity of 84.4%. For late sepsis, score 2 had a sensitivity of 88.5% and specificity of 90.4%. Conclusion: 2 predictive models were developed, one for proven earlyonset and another for proven late-onset neonatal sepsis. Derivation and preliminary validation produced good results. O219 Failure of oral colistin to prevent colonization with extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing enterobacteria in newborns hospitalized at a neonatal intensive care unit V. Strenger\u00b0, T. Gschliesser, G. Zarfel, G. Feierl, A.J. Grisold, L. Masoud, B. Resch, W. M\u00fcller, B. Urlesberger (Graz, AT) Objectives: Colonisation and infection with extended-spectrum b-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E.) is an emerging problem at Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). ESBL-E. often show additional antimicrobial resistance. Colistin is reported to be effective in treatment of infections with multiresistant enterobacteria as well as for selective digestive decontamination (SDD). Over the last years several outbreaks of ESBL-E. colonisation occurred at our NICU. Methods: For prophylaxis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) all term and preterm born neonates hospitalised at the NICU of the Medical University of Graz routinely receive gentamicin orally (15 mg/kg/d). Patients are routinely screened at least twice a week for ESBL-E. in stool specimens. ESBL-E. colonised patients subsequently are cohorted. From May 2005 through September 2007, gentamicin was replaced by colistin (8 mg/kg/d) administered orally during ESBL-E. outbreak situations. We retrospectively analysed all neonates colonised with ESBL-E. from May 2005 through September 2007 regarding influence of colistin on colonisation with ESBL-E.. Genetic relatedness of strains was assessed by using repPCR-technique. Results: During the study period 3 ESBL-E. outbreaks were observed and 30 (2.02%) out of 1488 neonates have been colonised with ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kp, n = 22) or Klebsiella oxytoca (ESBL-Ko, n = 8). 12 out of 22 pts. colonised with ESBL-Kp and 1 out of 8 pts. colonised with ESBL-Ko had received oral colistin at time of colonisation with ESBL-E. Four different clones of ESBL-Kp and 2 different clones of ESBL-Ko were isolated indicating occurrence of patient-to-patient transmission. Conclusion: Despite administration of Colistin during outbreaks of ESBL-E. colonisation, additional colonisations (including patient-topatient transmission) were observed. Thus, oral colistin (8 mg/kg/d) does not prevent colonisation with ESBL-E. Further analyses are needed to assess its usefulness for SDD. Containment of a nationwide outbreak of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae via a centrally-coordinated public health intervention. Background: Since 2006, Israeli hospitals have faced a clonal outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, producing the serine carbapenemase KPC-3. Locally-implemented infection control measures in affected hospitals failed to contain spread. A nationwide intervention was launched to contain the outbreak and introduce a strategy to control future dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in healthcare facilities. Methods: In March 2007, the Ministry of Health issued guidelines mandating physical separation of hospitalized carriers of carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and dedicated staffing, and appointed a professional task force charged with containing the spread of the epidemic strain. The task force paid site visits at acute care hospitals, evaluated infection control policies and laboratory methods, supervised adherence to the guidelines via daily census reports on carriers and their conditions of isolation, provided regular feedback on performance to hospital directors, and intervened additionally when necessary. During 2008, the intervention was extended to long-term care facilities, and in June 2008 national guidelines for active surveillance were issued. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of nosocomial CRE cases diagnosed by clinical culture in acute care hospitals. Results: By March 2007, over 1200 patients were affected in the nation's acute care hospitals.Prior to the nationwide intervention, the monthly incidence of noscomial CRE climbed steadily, peaking at over 180 cases. Crude 30-day mortality was >30%. With the intervention, the continuous rise in incidence of CRE acquisition was halted, and by the end of the 14-month initial intervention period the number of new monthly cases was reduced to 46. Following the introduction of active surveillance guidelines, monthly incidence fell further, reaching a low of 24 as of October 2009. A direct correlation was observed between compliance with isolation guidelines and success in containment of in-hospital CRE transmission.Conclusions: A centrally-coordinated public health intervention has succeeded in containing a nationwide outbreak of CRE in Israeli hospitals after local infection control measures failed. The intervention demonstrates the importance of strategic planning and national oversight in combating antimicrobial resistance.",

            "text": "Classical phenotypical identification of yeasts is often tedious and needs up to 3 days for optaining a reliable result. A further obstacle is the limited databases of commercially available systems and test results with variable outcome for a given species. Genetic identification by in situ hybridization or by sequence analysis is relative expensive in terms of consumables per test. After initial introduction of mass fingerprinting for species identification of bacteria by Claydon et al. 1996 availability easy-to-handle instruments and equiped with sophisticated analysis software facilitated use of this technique also for identification of yeasts in the last years. Qian et al.(2008)described the use a fixation step by using alcohol as an essential prerequisite for obtaining improved mass signatures in case of yeasts. In a comparative studyMarklein et al. (2009)  could show that usage of a commercial MALD-TOF MS-based microbial identification system (MALDI BioTyper System, Bruker Daltonics) was superior to a phenotypic based identification system in case of clinical yeasts. We could successfully demonstrate that addition of user defined reference spectra to this database facilitates a reliable discrimination of members of the Candida parapsilosis clade. VonBergen et al. (2009)  used this system for the otherwise difficult-to-achieve identification of potentially pathogenic Prototheca spp., a group of algae with a yeast-like cultural appearance.

T\u00f8njum\u00b0(Oslo,  Bergen, NO)    Objective: Our aim was to compare the use of DNA amplification by two polymerase chain reaction(PCR) tests for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis directly in human respiratory and extrapulmonary specimens. For this purpose, the sensitivity and specificity of culture and smear diagnostics as well as the Cobas Amplicor PCR test and the Cobas TaqMan MTB real-time PCR test were compared in a trial study. Methods: The PCR assays employed was the Cobas Amplicor M. tuberculosis test and the real-time PCR Cobas TaqMan MTB test (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland), which use the 16S rDNA as the target template. Eight hundred and seventy-eight samples from 763 patients submitted to our clinical microbiology laboratory were processed by enriched culture analysis, direct microscopy and PCR. Rifampicin susceptibility testing was performed with culture-based MGIT assays and rpo sequence analysis. Results: Out of the 878 clinical specimens, 120 were from TB-positive patients. In comparison with culture, the sensitivity of the real-time PCR test Cobas TaqMan MTB test and the Amplicor M. tuberculosis test were 99.0% and 95.5% for smear-positive samples and 83.0 and 72.1% for smear-negative samples, respectively. Interestingly, 15 specimens from TB-positive patients were real-time PCR positive and Amplicor PCR negative. These specimens included 8 airway samples and 7 extrapulmonary samples. A single TaqMan MTB test positive and culture negative specimen was found. The specificity of the M. tuberculosis PCR tests were challenged with DNAs and cultures from strains of Mycobacterium ulcerans and M. marinum, which are the mycobacterial species most closely related to the M. tuberculosis complex, resulting in negative PCR test results. Less than 2% of the isolates were rifampic in resistant, reflecting the low level of M. tuberculosis drug resistance in Norway. Conclusions: A comparison of two M. tuberculosis-specific PCR tests was performed, and the sensitivity of the real-time PCR test Cobas TaqMan MTB test was clearly superior to that of the Amplicor M. tuberculosis PCR test. The improved sensitivity, rapidity and less labour-intensive format of the Cobas TaqMan MTB test make this a valuable tool in routine tuberculosis diagnostics.

Results: Twelve PPD of 15 were negative in Xpert MTB/RIF and the COBAS TaqMan MTB Test. Culture was also negative for 10 of these. In two samples atypical mycobacterium was isolated. 3 PPD were positive in Xpert and COBAS and showed no mutations in rpoB. The culture confirmed M. tuberculosis sensitive to rifampicin in these 3 cases. 20 PNP of 24 were negative by both PCR techniques and culture. Four of 24 (1 CSF, 1 pleural, 2 lymph node biopsies) were positive by both techniques and showed no mutations in the rpoB gene. The culture confirmed M. tuberculosis sensitive to rifampicin in these 4 cases. Nine culture isolates tested were identified as M. tuberculosis by Xpert and GenProbe. One isolate was determined resistant to rifampicin in Xpert. This was confirmed by susceptibility testing. Conclusion: These preliminary results obtained on a limited number of samples show a perfect match for Xpert MTB/RIF with conventional laboratory tests irrespective of the nature of the sample tested.O236 Evaluation of the GeneXpert\u00ae MTB/RIF assay for the rapid detection of rifampicin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates C. Cavusoglu, A. Nazli\u00b0(Izmir, TR) Introduction: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most significant causes of death from an infectious agent. The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in Turkey is nearly 27.9 per 100,000 populations. The proportion of multidrug resistant tuberculosis among new cases is 2.9% and among previously treated cases is 15.5%. DNA sequencing studies demonstrate that 95% of rifampicin (RIF)resistant M. tuberculosis strains has a mutation within the 81-bp hotspot region of the rpoB gene. The GeneXpert \u00ae MTB/RIF Assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California) is a novel real-time PCR-based method for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and rapid detection of RIF-resistance in clinical specimens. However, there is a limited data about the performance of the GeneXpert \u00ae MTB/RIF Assay to detect different rpoB gene mutations. Objectives: We aimed to determine the performance of the GeneXpert \u00ae MTB/RIF Assay for detection of the mutation within the 81-bp hotspot region of the rpoB gene in RIF-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. Methods: A total of 37 M. tuberculosis isolates (27 RIF-resistant, 10 RIF-susceptible), were included in the study. Drug susceptibility testing for RIF had been previously performed with the proportional method on 7H10 medium due to the criteria of the CLSI. Mutations in the rpoB gene for each isolate had also been determined by DNA sequencing. The GeneXpert \u00ae MTB/RIF was able to detect the mutation within the 81 bp of the rpoB gene in 26 of the 27 RIF-resistant strains. However, one isolate had 490-CAT mutation outside the 81 bp of the rpoB gene was identified as susceptible by GeneXpert \u00ae MTB/RIF. The assay also correctly identified 10 RIF-susceptible isolates. Conclusion: GeneXpert \u00ae MTB/RIF correctly identified RIF-resistance, except one isolate which had a mutation outside the hot-spot region. In conclusion, this assay can be useful for the prediction of RIF resistance in clinical specimens and also for rapid screening of RIF resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. Table 1. Comparison of GeneXpert \u00ae MTB/RIF System with DNA sequencing data of RIF-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis (n = 27) O237 Detection by genotype MTBDRsl test of complex resistance mechanisms to second-line drugs and ethambutol in multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis F. Brossier, N. Veziris, A. Aubry, V. Jarlier, W. Sougakoff\u00b0(Paris, FR) Objectives: The Genotype MTBDRsl test aims at rapid detection of resistance to ethambutol, fluoroquinolones and second line aminoglycosides (amikacin, kanamycin) and cyclic peptide (capreomycin) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Methods: A set of 41 MDR (multidrug-resistant) and 8 XDR (extensively drug-resistant) Mtb strains has been tested by MTBDRsl and DNA sequencing of the resistance-determining regions in gyrA and gyrB (fluoroquinolones), rpsl (streptomycin), rrs and tlyA (aminoglycosidescyclic peptide) and embB (ethambutol). Results: The values of sensitivity/specificity of the MTBDRsl test were as follows: fluoroquinolones 87/96%, amikacin 100/100%, kanamycin 77/100%, capreomycin 80/98% and ethambutol 57/92%. Analysis of the discrepant results indicated that 3 FQ-resistant strains (including one XDR) with mutations in gyrB were missed by MTBDRsl, and that one FQ-susceptible strain, identified as resistant by MTBDRsl, had a double mutation T80A-A90G in GyrA not conferring resistance to FQ. Five strains (including 2 XDR) without mutation in rrs were mono-resistant to aminoglycosides or cyclic peptide and were missed by MTBDRsl. Finally, 16/28 ethambutol-resistant strains had a mutation at codon 306 in embB while 2/24 ethambutol susceptible strains had such a mutation. Conclusions: MTBDRsl efficiently detects the most common mutations involved in resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides-cyclic peptide and ethambutol and accurately assesses susceptibility to amikacin. However, due to mutations not included in the test (particularly in gyrB) or yet-uncharacterized resistance mechanisms (particularly those related to ethambutol and to aminoglycosides-cyclic peptide monoresistance), the wild-type results yielded by the MTBDRsl test need to be confirmed by drug susceptibility testing when the prevalence of resistance is high. Objectives: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, with high mortality rates and serious long-term consequences. Accurate and early diagnostic confirmation is essential in patient management. The purposes of this study was to, retrospectively, evaluate the performance of a molecular test for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in cerebrospinal fluid specimens (CSF), compared with culture and microscopy, and correlate the results with clinical findings. Methods: Between November 2005 and September 2009, 118 CSF specimens were sent to the Molecular Biology Unit of Centro Hospitalar do Porto, with requests for M. tuberculosis molecular detection (MTD, GenProbe), with mycobacterial culture (MGITTM and Lowenstein-Jensen) and microscopy examination performed in the Microbiology laboratory. MTD test was performed as described by manufacturer, but after mechanical cell lysis, nucleic acid purification was carried out in EZ1 BioRobot (Qiagen). Presence of amplification inhibition was verified in every sample. MTB diagnosis was based in laboratory results and clinical criteria, such as patient response to anti-bacillary therapy. Results: 118 samples from 107 patients were studied. Molecular detection of M. tuberculosis complex was positive in 5 cases, which were confirmed by cultural methods. Microscopy revealed acid-fast bacilli in one sample. MTB diagnosis (laboratory and clinical criteria) was established in 17 cases, 12 being presumptive. All 17 patients showed altered cytology with pleocytosis. Protein level was elevated in 16 samples (0.55-10.5 g/L). Compared with MTB diagnosis, MTD showed a sensitivity value of 30%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 89%. Conclusion: Our results suggest the potential role of molecular methods in confirming diagnosis of MTB, with short turnaround time results (2.5 h), high PPV, and similar sensitivity as culture (30%). Results must be interpreted in parallel with clinical findings and conventional microbiology methods. The use of molecular tests should not exclude a diagnosis of MTB (NPV-89%).

Herrmann (Uppsala, Gothenburg, SE) Objectives: To determine the sequence of the rnpB gene, coding for the ubiquitously present ribonuclease P RNA, and develop a real-time PCR for detection of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and atypical mycobacteria. Methods: The rnpB sequences of 17 Mycobacterium spp. were determined. Based on obtained rnpB sequences, two quantitative realtime PCRs for detection of the M. tuberculosis complex (Mytu PCR)and atypical mycobacteria (Myat PCR) were developed and combined into a single tube format. The analytical sensitivity of the PCR assay was determined with serial dilutions of target DNA. The specificity of the duplex PCR assay was tested with 21 mycobacteria species (55 strains), and 35 bacteria species other than mycobacteria. The PCR assay was evaluated on 10 samples from a quality control panel (QCMD) and on 442 clinical samples. The results were compared with the results of culture, direct microscopic examination and the Roche Amplicor PCR. Results: Obtained rnpB sequences showed hypervariable regions enabling species specific identification and PCR design. The analytical sensitivity for detection of the M. tuberculosis complex was <50 copies/reaction, while for atypical mycobacteriae it was 500 copies/reaction. The assay was specific and did not detect any of 35 non-mycobacterial bacteria spp.The Mytu PCR specifically detected all four species of the M. tuberculosis complex and the Myat PCR detected all tested 17 atypical mycobacteria species, except 2 of 7 strains from the M. avium complex. The PCR assay correctly detected all 10 samples from QCMD quality assurance panel. In analysis of 442 clinical specimens M. tuberculosis was detected in 40 cases (9%) by Mytu PCR, in 38 cases (8%) by the Roche PCR, in 46 cases (10%) by culture and in 23 (5%) cases by direct microscopic examination. The atypical mycobacteriae were detected by Myat PCR in 18 (4%) cases, in 11 (2%) by culture cases, and in 8 cases (2%) by direct microscopic examination. Conclusions: Sequence determination of the rnpB gene is useful for Mycobacterium species identification. Our duplex real-time PCR was shown to detect strains from both the M. tuberculosis complex and tested atypical mycobacteria strains.The PCR assay has a broader detection range of mycobacteria than commercial standard PCR method and has a sensitivity similar to culture.O240 Molecular differentiation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex members from non-tuberculous mycobacteriaM.Slany\u00b0, J. Svobodova, I. Pavlik (Brno, CZ)    Objective: Most mycobacterial infections are still caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) members; however, infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasing, particularly among immunocompromised patients. NTM are ubiquitous in the environment and are responsible for several diseases in humans known as mycobacterioses. More than 128 mycobacterial species are currently described. Conventional species-specific identification and proper patient management are delayed due to the slow-growing nature of mycobacteria, their biochemical properties and antituberculotic drugs sensitivity testing. We propose simple molecular based method using multiplex PCR (mPCR) for rapid detection and differentiation of NTM from MTC followed by sequence analysis used for NTM identification. Methods: In the frame of study were have analysed: 50 MTC and 57 NTM isolates collected in 2009 in the Czech Republic; 14 non mycobacterial (non myco) reference strains. Bacterial supernatant applied as DNA template for the mPCR reaction targeting rpoB gene was used for detection and differentiation of isolates as MTC or NTM. One amplicon of 235 bp from MTC members or a single amplicon of 136 bp from NTM are expected. NTM identification was archieved by DNA sequence analysis of the species-specific 16S rRNA gene region.Results:The mPCR reaction with template DNA from mycobacteria yielded the expected amplicons. We assume that proposed mPCR is specific for mycobacteria because analysis of non myco strains resulted in any amplicons. Detection limit for proposed mPCR was 50 copies per reaction, which faciliated its use for analysis of DNA extracted directly from clinical samples (sputa or biopsies). DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene confirmed the status of analysed bacterial isolates and enabled precise isolate identification to the species level. Different NTM(Table 1) causing mycobacterial infections in humans were detected using this approach.Conclusion:The mPRC used in this study allowed rapid detection and differentiation of primary cultures as MTC, NTM or non myco. Specific NTM identification is possible in second step by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene, thus helping in timely institution of specific mycobacterial therapy.

A Poisson model was used to estimate change in carbapenem defined daily doses/1000 patient days (DDD) over time. A rate ratio (RR) was calculated to compare carbapenem usage between 2003 and 2008 with a 95% confidence interval. Results: P. aeruginosa susceptibility to I, PT, C, and T remained the same over 5 years and improved in year 6. An overall c 2 test (p = 0.010) indicated a difference in percentages over time. The Mantel-Haenszel test for linear trend (p = 0.004) indicated an increasing trend in percentages over time. 91% ESBL K. pneumoniae and 100% ESBL E. coli and K. oxytoca isolates tested to E were susceptible MIC < 2.

Mera\u00b0, J. Suaya, H.A. Madsen, C.S. Hogea, E. Lu, C. Acosta (Durham, Philadelphia, Upper Providence, US) Objectives: To describe the role of Community-Acquired (CA) MRSA in inpatient and outpatient staphylococcus aureus infections over a 10 year period in the US. Methods: The study used the TSN Network \u00ae surveillance database (Eurofins Medinet) for the period 1998 to 2007. The database contains information on isolate source, setting (ambulatory or hospital), geographic region, and demographic characteristics such as gender and age. Identical CLSI breakpoints were used for all the time points. CA-MRSA phenotype was defined by a resistance profile that includes the absence of gentamicin/cotrimoxazole resistance, and the absence of ciprofloxacin/ clindamycin/ erythromycin co-resistance. Using multivariate logistic regression, we computed adjusted phenotype prevalences and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The study consisted of 824,307 S. aureus isolates. MRSA prevalence continuously increased over the 10 year period from 32.7% in 1998 to 53.8% in 2007 (OR 2.4, 95% CI 2.3\u22122.5). CA-MRSA represented an increasing proportion of MRSA from 22.3% in 1998 to 66.1% in 2007 (OR 6.7, 95% CI 6.5\u22126.9). Changes in CA-MRSA prevalence were observed for all age-groups, isolate sources, inpatient or outpatient settings, and across all geographic regions of the US. However, a comparatively larger statistically significant temporal increase of CA-MRSA occurred in children and young adults as compared to the elderly, and in abscess and wound isolates when compared to blood and sputum. By 2007, 81.5% of all MRSA isolates were categorized as CA-MRSA among children, while CA-MRSA represented 48.9% of MRSA isolates from the elderly. In 2007, out of all MRSA, CA-MRSA represented 85.7% of all abscess, 75.4% of wound, 43.6% of blood and 30.4% of sputum isolates, as well as 84.5% of outpatient and 40.8% of inpatient isolates. Conclusion: In the study period, MRSA isolates have become a growing proportion of all S. aureus isolates.

Lykas, A. Panopoulou, I. Patikas, A. Spathi, I. Tsouma,  S. Demeridou, E. Kouskouni (Athens, GR)    Objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered a \"high-risk\" pathogen responsible for severe intensive care unit (ICU) \u2212 acquired infections. In an era of increasing resistance, nosocomial infections caused by P. aeruginosa are very common despite the application of preventive measures in ICU leading to prolonged hospital stay, increased morbidity, mortality and treatment cost. Very often, in the last years, clinicians are left with very few antimicrobials as therapeutic options. Therefore, we aimed to study the susceptibility profile of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates against an extended panel of antibiotics in the last 2 years. Methods: Beginning January 2008 to October 2009 all strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from surgical patients in the ICU were studied. In order to identify aerobic microorganisms we inoculated the specimens on blood agar, MacConkey, Mannitol Salt and Sabouraud Dextrose agar, and then incubated the plates at 37\u00ba C for 24 hours, whereas anaerobic cultures were carried out on Wilkins-Chalgren agar at 37\u00ba C for 48 hours. The identification of isolated strains and their susceptibility test to antibiotics using an extended panel of antibiotics were carried out with the automated system VITEK 2 (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Results: A total of 52 isolates from 21 patients in 2008 and 49 isolates from 19 patients in 2009 were studied. An increased resistance in all antimicrobials studied (except for colistin), was observed. The most active antimicrobials against P. aeruginosa isolates during 2008 and 2009 were piperacillin with 15% and 32% resistance, respectively, piperacillin/ tazobactam 8% and 17%, gentamicin 21% and 50%, amikacin 18% and 43%, tobramycin 18% and 47%, ceftazidime 29% and 46%, and ciprofloxacin 26% and 49%, respectively. Thirty-six percent of the isolates were resistant to imipenem in 2008 and 37% in 2009 while for meropenem the resistance was 31% and 40%, respectively, and for tigecycline 36% and 58%, respectively. Finally, colistin was the least resistant among all antimicrobials tested (9% in 2008 and 2% in 2009). Conclusion: The development of resistance must be carefully monitored in hospitals. Due to an increased use of tigecycline in our ICU, an emerging resistance to this new and promising antimicrobial was observed. Colistin maintained significant in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa isolates and should be considered in critically ill patients with difficult-to-treat infections. O486 Surveillance of drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis patterns in clinical sputum samples C.D. Kalunga\u00b0, M. Tembo (Lusaka, ZM) Introduction: Testing for first line anti tuberculosis drugs formed the back bone of the study based on routine drug susceptibility testing since these drugs are widely used in the world and tested for in rounds of proficiency testing among reference laboratories. Therefore the need to determine the susceptibility and resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 641clinical samples for diagnosis and from retreatment samples in the period between 2000 and 2009. Objective: To determine the drug resistance patterns for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples. Methodology: This was a retrospective descriptive study conducted at chest diseases laboratory. 641 Tuberculosis positive cultures by proportion methods. Data of the drug resistance survey conducted during this period was excluded. Results: The total number of strains examined was 641, showing drug resistance to one, more drugs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. The trend seen in the study period shows that proportions of resistance to Rifampcin and Isoniazid was increasing suggestive of secondary drug resistance. The resistance to streptomycin was high at 8.4%. Isoniazid resistance trend was at 3.5%. Ethambutol 0.04%. Conclusion: out of 641 positive cultures tested for drug susceptibility, 228 were resistant to one, two, three and four drugs. Multi drug resistance (6.3%) showed a rising trend and threatening to be a problem. Streptomycin resistance was highest (8.4%) may be because it is used for treatment of other infections. Mono resistance to Isoniazid (5.1%) was in rising proportions due to its use in preventive administration. Resistance to Rifampicin (1.09%), Ethambutol at 0.47% respectively. O487 Four major drug-resistant mycobacterial strains isolated between 2001-2008 in Konya, Turkey I. Tuncer, H. Turk Dagi, G. Solgun, S. Yuksekkaya, O. Akkaya, U. Arslan\u00b0, D. Findik (Konya, TR) Objectives: In our study, we aimed to detect the presence of M. tuberculosis with the BACTEC 460TB system (2001-2006) and the BACTEC MGIT 960 (Mycobacteria Growth Indicat\u00f6r Tubes, Becton-Dickenson) system (2007-2008) in clinical samples containing suspected pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis and also to determine the resistance of the isolated M. tuberculosis strains against four major antimicrobial drugs. The study period was between 2001 and 2008. Methods: From 2001 to 2006, antimicrobial susceptibility tests to isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (SM), ethambutol (EMB) and rifampin (RIF) on 635 Mycobacterial strains were performed using the radiometric BACTEC 460TB system. From 2007 to 2008, antimicrobial susceptibility tests on 270 Mycobacterial strains were performed with the BACTEC MGIT 960 SIRE kit. Results: Of the 1039 M.tbc spp., antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on 905. We observed that 84.8% (767/905) were susceptible to all 4 antibiotics, 15.2% (138/767) were resistant to at least one of the 4 antibiotics. Mono resistance rates to INH, SM, RIF, and EMB were 4.4, 1.3, 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. Total monodrug resistance was observed in 6.7% of 905 the Mycobacterial isolates. Resistance to two drugs was observed in 48 (5.3%) isolates, to three drugs in 24 (2.7%) isolates and to four drugs in 5 (0.5%) isolates. The prevalence of MDR (Multidrug Resistance) in 905 Mycobacterial isolates was 4% (36/905).Conclusions: According to these results it could be concluded that, drug resistance which requires immediate solution, continues to be a major problem in our region.Figure.

Duval (Paris, Bron, FR)    Objective: Evaluation of oseltamir-zanamivir combination efficacy and tolerance is of interest given the (H1N1) 2009 virus pandemic. Methods: A randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study was conducted during the 2009 seasonal Influenza epidemic to evaluate oseltamivir-zanamivir combination. Adults with influenza like illness for less than 36 hours and a positive Influenza A rapid test diagnosis were randomized to oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily plus zanamivir 10 mg by inhalation twice daily (OZ), oseltamivir plus inhaled placebo (O) or zanamivir plus oral placebo (Z). Virological success was defined by a nasal viral load (RT-PCR) J2 <200 copies genome equivalents (cgeq) / ml. Clinical response was assessed by time to allevation as symptoms. Results: Overall 541 patients were included (OZ, n = 173; O, n = 192; Z, n = 176). In the intention-to-treat analysis conducted in the 447 patients with confirmed Influenza A, the virological response was 46%, 59%, and 34% in OZ, O and Z arms (p = 0.025, p = 0.028 for OZ/O and OZ/Z comparisons). Mean viral load decrease D0-D2 was 2.14, 2.49, and 1.68 log10 cgeq /mL (p = 0.060, p = 0.016 for OZ/O and OZ/Z comparisons). The time of disappearance of symptoms were 4, 3, 4 days (p = 0.030, p = 0.77 for OZ/O and OZ / Z) The combination was well tolerated. Conclusions: Monotherapy of oseltamivir remains the first line antiviral strategy for the ongoing Influenza pandemic. The lesser effect of the oseltamivir-zanamivir combination should be further investigated.O502 Effectiveness and safety of neuraminidase inhibitorsin reducing influenza complications: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials M.

Barcarollo, V. Mari (Caxias do Sul, BR)    Objectives: In July 2009, a respiratory illness outbreak caused by influenza A virus (H1N1-2009) was identified in Caxias do Sul, Brazil. The aim of this work is to describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of hospitalized patients at a public university hospital for viral pneumonia who had laboratory confirmed H1N1-2009 infection. Methods: Retrospective medical chart reviews on the hospitalized patients between July and August 2009. H1N1-2009 infection was confirmed in specimens with the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction assay. Results: From July 1 through August 30, 2009, a total of 40 cases of confirmed H1N1-2009 pneumonia were identified among 124 patients hospitalized for acute respiratory illness at the Caxias do Sul General Hospital. More than half of the 40 patients were between 20 and 49 years of age, and only 10 had preexisting medical conditions. All patients had fever, cough, dyspnea or respiratory distress, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and lymphopenia. Thirty-seven patients required mechanical ventilation, and five died. Conclusions:In 2009, our region had the coldest winter season in many years. Influenza infections are common cause of respiratory diseases in our city, but on this year there was an increase of visits to doctors for influenza-like-illness and also flu-related hospitalizations. Comparisons with seasonal influenza suggest that pandemic influenza A (H1N1-2009) disproportionately affects younger ages and causes generally mild disease, but during the outbreak we noticed that H1N1-2009 infection had caused severe pneumonia and death in many previously young to middle-aged healthy persons.O504 Hospitalized cancer patients with severe infections due to the novel influenza A (H1N1) inBrazil E.

Kim (Seoul, KR)    Objectives: Since the first outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1) in May 2009, the virus has been spread throughout local communities. More than 4,000 diagnosed cases are being reported daily as of November 2009. One of the major infection routes is the educational institutions, so children and teenagers have very high risk of viral exposure. Recently, mass outbreaks were reported from 870 schools within one week. Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) is operating nationwide monitoring system for severe hospitalization cases. The objective of this study is to highlight demographics, infection risk factors and clinical courses. Methods: Novel influenza A (H1N1) patients who were hospitalized in intensive care unit or had pneumonia in needs of intubation were categorized as severe pediatric patients. Between June and October, total of 22 cases under the age of 18 were identified as severe patients. After the medical chart review, we had an interview with the doctor in charge. All the patients were laboratory-confirmed novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction. Based on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the patients with high-risk medical conditions were defined as having higher risk for influenza complications. Result: Among the reported 22 severe cases, 15 were male and 7 were female. Ages ranged from 2 months to 18 years old (median 7, standard deviation 5.4). Fourteen patients (63%) had high-risk medical conditions patients have expired. Patients took anti-viral agent (Tamiflu \u00ae ) average 2 days after onset. Thirteen patients received ventilator care, 7 did not and 2 were unsure. Viral pneumonia was the most common complication (17 cases, 77%) and 3 patients exacerbated into acute respiratory distress syndrome. Initial symptoms were fever and cough (18 cases, 81% each).There were 11 leukocytosis, 3 leucopenia and 3 thrombocytopenia cases on complete blood count. Conclusions: Half of patients with high-risk medical conditions have expired. Considering current situations, we need to maintain high-risk medical conditions category and to have continuous tracking for severe pediatric patients with novel influenza A (H1N1).Table 1.

Vanhems (Lyon, FR) Objective: The aim of this study was to describe trends of ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP) incidence in 12 intensive care units (ICU) by taking into account of individual major risk factors of VAP. Methods: A prospective surveillance in 12 ICUs participating in the national nosocomial infection surveillance network in South-East France between 1995 and 2006 was done. The VAP was defined base on clinical, radiological and bacteriological findings, according to the national protocol. Yearly incidences of VAP were described. The risk of VAP by time was modelled using a Cox proportional hazard model with the year of admission in ICU as the main exposure. The tested covariates were age, gender, and SAPSII.",

A total of 1,936 VAP were observed. The mean incidence was 16.4/1 000 patient-days. The mean age was 56 years (Standard deviation = 32), and the mean SAPSII was 43 (Sd =19). Variations over time were observed for VAP incidence (P < 0.001), age (P < 0.001), and SAPSII (P < 0.001), significant by the Pearson khi square test. After multivariate analysis, VAP risk per year decreased between years 1996 to1998, increased continuously until 2001 and stabilized between 2002and 2006, compared to 1995; 95% CI [0.81-1.14]). Conclusion: Despite of an increase of risk factors as age and SAPSII scores of ICU patients by time, we observed that the adjusted VAP risk between 2002 and 2006 were stable. These results should be a consequence of the implementation of specific prevention measures related to ICUs practitioners.Objective: To investigate whether ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a true cause of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of available data obtained through search of PubMed and relevant bibliographies without time restrictions. A conservative DerSimonian-Laird random effects model was employed to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Out of 968 retrieved reports, 44 papers fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Presence, as opposed to absence, of VAP was associated with higher mortality in the ICU setting (OR: 1.96, 95% CI:[1.26, 3.04]). This result persisted when matched case control studies (OR 1.73, 95% CI:[1.23, 2.45])  or studies in which VAP was microbiologically confirmed in all patients (OR: 2.20, 95% CI:[1.01, 4.81]) were evaluated separately. VAP was still associated with higher mortality when the impact of immunosuppresion was controlled (OR:1.74, 95% CI: [0.95, 3.16]); a finding that did not reach statistical significance. Though, presence of VAP was not associated with higher mortality in the subgroup analysis of studies including patients who received appropriate initial antimicrobial treatment(OR 1.64 [0.68, 3.96]). Conclusion: Presence, compared to absence, of VAP seems to be associated with higher mortality in critically ill patients. Appropriateness of initial antimicrobial treatment in such patients may moderate this association.",

The treatment choices are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of tigecyline in MDR A. baumannii pneumonia. Method: This study was performed at a tertiary-care educational university hospital with an active respiratory diseases ward with 100 beds, 8 of which are in ICU. We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of adult (>18 years old) patients with culture proven MDR A. baumannii pneumoniae treated with tigecycline between January 2009 and November 2009. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, predisposing factors, as well as information on response to treatment and outcome were obtained from each patient's hospital records.Results: There were a total of 34 cases (18 male, mean age 66.79\u00b114.84 years) fulfilling our inclusion criteria. On the admission 17 cases were diagnosed as community-acquired pneumonia and 12 were diagnosed as chronic obstructive lung disease. 27 cases (79.4%) had comorbidities and the most common comorbidity was atherosclerotic heart disease (8 cases) followed by diabetes mellitus (5 cases), cerebrovascular disease (5 cases), respectively. When A. baumannii was isolated from respiratory samples 19 were considered as ventilator-associated pneumonia and 15 were considered as hospital-acquired pneumonia. All isolates were sensitive to tigecycline, whereas all were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime, 74%, 56%, 41% and 24% were resistant to imipenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, amikacin and netilmicin, respectively. Tigecycline was used for a mean duration of 9.6\u00b15.2 days. Microbiologic eradication (on day 3 and 7) was observed in 21 cases (61.8%). Tigecycline was combined with cefoperazone/sulbactam in 12 cases, with netilmicin in 6 cases and with amikacin in 3 cases. Nine of 21 cases with microbiologic eradication were lost whereas mortality was 100% in the other 13 cases (p = 0.0006). Mortality and microbiologic eradication rates were not different in combination vs monotherapy (p > 0.05). Mortal cases were elder than the survivors (71.1\u00b112.6 vs 58.9\u00b115.9, p = 0.02). Toxicity developed only in one case as liver toxicity. Conclusion: Our findings show that microbiologic eradication rate of tigecycline in MDR A. baumannii is not very low. However this microbiologic eradication rate did not result in good clinical results in terms of mortality probably due to comorbidities. Daptomycin \u2212 clinical experience O511 Daptomycin for the treatment of infective endocarditis: results from European Cubicin \u00ae Outcomes Registry and Experience (EU-CORE) P. Dohmen\u00b0, A.

Chaves (Berlin, DE; Lancashire, UK; Rome, Naples, IT; Zaragoza, ES; Glasgow, UK; Madrid, ES; Basel, CH) Objective: Randomized controlled trials are scarce in endocarditis and might not be representative for the general patient population. The aim of this registry was to describe the clinical experience with Daptomycin (DAP) for the treatment of infective endocarditis (IE) in Europe. DAP is approved in Europe for the treatment of right-sided endocarditis due to S. aureus at a dose of 6 mg/kg once daily. Methods: In this multi-centre, retrospective, non-interventional registry, the outcome data were collected in patients (pts) who were diagnosed with native or prosthetic valve IE and treated with at least one dose of DAP. Clinical outcomes were assessed at the end of DAP treatment by the investigators using standard definitions (cured, improved, failure, non-evaluable). Success was defined as the sum of cured or improved outcome rates. Results: Of the total 2581 pts in the EU-CORE registry from Jan 2006 to Aug 2009, 276 pts (68% male and 53% 65 years of age) had IE. A total of 117 (42%) pts received DAP in an ICU, congestive heart failure was present in 31 (11%) pts and cardiac arrhythmias in 59 (21%) pts. Right sided endocarditis was observed in 66 (24%) pts, left sided endocarditis in 191 (69%) pts, and right plus left sided endocarditis in 19 (7%) pts, respectively. The most common primary pathogen was S. aureus (n = 73, 26%), of which 25 were reported as MRSA. 180 (66%) pts received concomitant antibiotic therapy, most commonly aminoglycosides (71, 26%) or carbapenems (46, 17%). The majority of pts received DAP doses of 6 mg/kg (62%) or higher (21%). The clinical outcome per IE type were: Right sided endocarditis, success 92%, failure 5%, non-evaluable (NE) 3%; Left sided endocarditis, success 76%, failure 9%, NE 14%; Right plus left sided endocarditis, success 89%, NE 11%.The proportion of pts with low Creatinine clearance (<30 mL/min) improved from 17% (46/276) initially to 13% (35/276) at the end of DAP treatment. Serious AEs were reported in 34 (12%) pts and 20 (7%) pts discontinued the study drug due to AEs.Conclusions: Daptomycin appears effective and well tolerated against a variety of clinical presentations of infective endocarditis. Success rates and adverse event profile, including renal safety were comparable to those observed in the pivotal trials. Further clinical studies on infective endocarditis e.g. on the impact of DAP at higher doses might be warranted.O512 High-dose daptomycin for infective endocarditisR.Kullar\u00b0, S. Davis, C. Crank, J. Segreti, S. Cosgrove, J. Zhao,  D. Levine, M. Rybak (Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, US)    Objective: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious infection associated with high morbidity and mortality. IE due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci including vancomycinresistant strains (VRE) has been associated with high failure rates. Daptomycin (DAP) has activity against both MRSA and VRE strains. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of high-dose (HD) DAP ( 8 mg/kg/day) for MRSA and VRE IE. Methods: Consecutive patients treated with HD DAP for 72 h, excluding dialysis, were retrospectively reviewed at 4 academic medical centres. This subset analysis included all patients with IE defined by modified Duke criteria. Charts were reviewed for demographics, comorbidities, antimicrobial therapy, microbiologic cultures, clinical outcomes, and adverse events.Results: 45 patients were identified. Baseline characteristics: Median age 53 years (range 24\u221293), APACHE II 7 (0\u221228), 57.8% hospitalization 1 year, 22.2% MRSA infection 1 year, 57.8% injection drug use, 28.9% diabetes, 22.2% renal disease. 23 (51.1%) patients had rightsided IE (RIE), 20 (44.4%) patients had left-sided IE (LIE), and 2 (4.4%) patients had both RIE and LIE.

Data for alternative management in these cases is lacking, particularly with daptomycin (DAP). Methods: We conducted a case-control study evaluating treatment with VAN or DAP for MRSA-B with a VAN MIC of 1.5 or 2 ug/mL. Patients were matched 2:1 by risk level of source, APACHE-II score at onset of infection and age. Respiratory infections were excluded. Failure was a composite of: 30-day mortality, microbiologic failure (positive cultures >10 d from index culture) and/or recurrence of MRSA-B within 30 days of end of tx. Results: DAP treated patients (n 37) were compared to VAN treated patients (n 74). VAN MIC was 1.5 (46 v 85%) and 2.0 (54 v 15%), p < 0.01. Source of infection was similar between groups including endocarditis (27 v 24%), skin (38 v 32%), catheter (19 v 19%), device (8 v 11%) and other (8 v 14%). Age, comorbidities, APACHE II score (14 v 14) and requirement of ICU admission (24 vs 21%) was similar between groups, p > 0.05. Immunosuppression (24 v 7%) was more common in the DAP group, p < 0.05. Factors significantly associated with failure; ICU at onset of infection, nursing home residence, CV disease, DM, and ARF, p < 0.05. IVDA was significantly associated with cure, p < 0.05. Factors associated with 30 day mortality; Caucasian race, ICU at onset of infection, NH residence, ARF, p < 0.05. Hemodialysis was significantly associated with survival, p < 0.05. VAN MIC by Etest had no association with failure or mortality. There was a trend toward less failure (14 v 28%) and lower 30-day mortality (3 v 16%) in the DAP group, p = 0.06. Between groups, baseline comorbidities, risk level of source and APACHE-II scores were similar, although immunosuppresion and isolates with VAN MIC=2 were greater in the DAP group. This study shows that DAP may be associated with better outcome of infection as compared to VAN, and trended toward lower 30-day mortality, particularly in subjects with MRSA endocarditis.O515 Daptomycin against highly resistant Enterococcus faeciuminvasive infections C.Rosin\u00b0, C.

Carnevale, G. Iotti, G. Accetta, M. Langer, M. Regazzi (Pavia, Milan, IT) Objectives: Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are a growing clinical problem and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We evaluated colistin concentrations at steady-state in plasma samples and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of critically ill patients admitted to our ICU. Methods: Nineteen patients (16M, 3F) aged 20\u221270 years and affected with ventilator-associated pneumonia were enrolled. Six patients received 1 million IU of colistin methanesulphonate (CMS) intravenously every 6 hours; thirteen patients received 2 million IU every 8 hours for at least 2 days. Blood samples were collected from each patient at baseline (predose) and at time intervals after the end of CMS infusion. BAL was performed in all patients at 2 hours post-infusion. Colistin plasma and bronchoalveolar concentrations were measured using a selective and sensitive high performance liquid chromatography assay with fluorescence detector. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by non-compartmental analysis using Innaphase Kinetica\u2122 4.0 software. Results: Patients receiving 1M IU/6 h had mean [\u00b1SD] Cmax and Cmin plasma concentrations at the steady-state of 1.57 [\u00b10.57] and 1.10 [\u00b10.43] mg/ml, respectively. Mean [\u00b1SD] AUC(0\u22126 h), t1/2 and Vd were 6.40 [\u00b12.32] mg\u00b7h/ml, 8.36 [\u00b14.94] h, and 220.46 [\u00b176.61] L/h, respectively. Patients receiving 2M IU/8 h had mean [\u00b1SD] plasma Cmax and Cmin levels at steady-state of 2.21 [\u00b11.08] and 0.98 [\u00b10.70] mg/ml, respectively. Mean [\u00b1SD] AUC(0\u22128 h), t1/2 and Vd were 11.54 [\u00b16.20] mg\u00b7h/ml, 5.87 [\u00b12.56] h, and 143.24 [\u00b1116.47] L/h, respectively. Cmax/MIC and AUC(0\u221224 h) /MIC ratios (MIC = 2 mg/ml) were 0.79 [\u00b10.28] and 12.79 [\u00b14.65], 1.1 [\u00b10.54] and 17.30 [\u00b19.30], after administration of 1M IU and 2M IU, respectively. Colistin was undetectable in BAL under both regimens. A complete eradication of bacteria was observed in 12/13 of our patients with the 2M IU/8 h dosing schedule. Conclusions: In critically ill patients, the 2M IU/8 h dose regimen provided higher Cmax and AUC than the 1M IU/6 h schedule: this may be a therapeutic advantage because the AUC/MIC and Cmax/MIC ratios are strongly associated with efficacy. Further studies are needed to provide important clinical answers, from individualising treatment to optimising dosage and reducing adverse effects.",

Kilpatrick, S. Bagheri Nejad, W. Graafmans, D. Pittet (Geneva, CH) Objective: The WHO First Global Patient Safety Challenge \"Clean Care is Safer Care\" (CCiSC) recognises the importance of nationally coordinated activities in achieving its goal of reducing healthcareassociated infection (HAI) through improved hand hygiene in healthcare. A baseline survey of existing hand hygiene national/sub-national initiatives was conducted in 2007 and repeated in early 2009 to assess current status and to generate information on factors contributing to their success. Methods: Campaigns and programmes promoting hand hygiene in healthcare were identified through WHO regional offices and experts in the field. An online survey using a structured questionnaire was conducted during March-April 2009 . Results: In 2009 , 38/38 campaigns/programmes identified (18/20 in 2007 completed the survey. Of the 38, 29 were active national/subnational level initiatives from all WHO regions, except for Africa; 21 (72.4%) were initiated after the launch of CCiSC in October 2005. The main targets of hand hygiene promotion were general, district and university hospitals, with increasing coverage of long-term care facilities and primary care. The scope varied from awareness raising to well scaled-up activities with ongoing evaluation. Most activities (20/29) obtained funding from multiple sources with governments among the main funders; governments were responsible for initiating 25/29 (86.2%) campaigns/programmes. Through the 2009 survey, the facilitator role played by CCiSC in initiating activities and the support with tools and recommendations emerged very clearly. Barriers were identified, but the perceived significance of specific barriers varied considerably. Those related to commitment (priority and support) and resource availability were important across all regions. A range of indicators to measure the impact of the initiative was reported with process indicators being more common. Conclusion: Hand hygiene is being promoted in healthcare in several countries at national/sub-national level with clear objectives, strategies and governmental support. Such embedding through policies and resource allocation is important for sustainability. Actions to improve commitment from different stakeholders are needed. Indicators for measuring impact need to be more uniform and more widely implemented. Further actions to initiate coordinated activities across the world, including countries with limited resources, are required.O466 Effect of a multifaceted intervention on adherence to hand hygiene among healthcare workers: a cluster randomized trial D. Mertz\u00b0, N. Dafoe, S. Walter, K. Brazil, M. Loeb (Hamilton, CA) Objectives: Compliance with hand hygiene among health care workers (HCWs) is widely felt to be a key factor in reducing the spread of nosocomial infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a multi-faceted intervention to increase adherence of hand hygiene among healthcare workers (HCWs) and assess the effect on the incidence of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted from June 2007 to May 2008 in 30 units of three tertiary care hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Study units included eight medical, four general surgery and eight intensive care units. Following a three month baseline period of data collection, 15 units were randomly assigned to the intervention arm (performance feedback, small group teaching seminars, posters) and 15 to usual practice. Hand hygiene was observed during randomly selected fifteen-minute periods on each unit and the incidence of MRSA measured using surveillance specimens. Results: 3812 (48.2%) of 7901 opportunities for hand hygiene in the intervention group resulted in adherence compared to 3205 (42.6%) of 7526 opportunities in the control group (P < 0.001). However, there was a significant increase of adherence compared to baseline adherence (15.4% in the control and 16.2% in the intervention group) for both groups ( Figure) . There was no reduction in the incidence of nosocomial MRSA in the intervention group. Conclusion: Among HCWs in Ontario tertiary care hospitals, adherence to hand hygiene significantly increased with a multi-faceted intervention. Moreover, there was a marked increase in adherence to hand hygiene in both study groups. No resulting difference in MRSA rates between patients in the two study groups could be observed. Figure. Mean adherence rates to hand hygiene in the control and intervention group.",

Stone\u00b0(London, UK) Objectives: WHO guidelines stipulate that gloves are required for specific clinical procedures, but warn that they are not a substitute for disinfecting or cleaning hands. It has been suggested previously that wearing gloves could be a barrier to good hand hygiene compliance but the literature is divided as to whether healthcare workers (HCWs) are less likely to clean their hands when wearing gloves. We carried out a large multicentre study to determine whether wearing gloves was associated with poorer hand hygiene compliance. Rodriguez-Villalobos, A. Guisset, A. Deplano, T.D. Huang, B. Lissoir, R. Cartuyvels, A. de Moreau, Y. Glupczynski (Yvoir, Brussels, Gilly, Hasselt, BE) Objectives: Worldwide emergence and spread of multidrug resistant A. baumannii (AB) is a matter of concern. We studied the microbiologic, epidemiological and molecular characteristics of GES-like producing AB isolates (GPAB) recovered from 5 different Belgian hospitals. Methods: Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by agar disk diffusion, VITEK2, and Etest MIC determination. ESBL, carbapenemase coding genes and their genetic environment were analyzed by PCRsequencing. OXA-51 and ADC-like coding genes were also characterized and the isolates were typed by PFGE. b-lactamase activities were analyzed by IEF. Results: Between april 2009 and September 2009, 9 patients with GPAB isolates were identified in 5 Belgian hospitals. Isolates were recovered upon admission from wound infection, and one empyema. Index patients (pts) were transferred from Turkey (n = 2), Egypt (n = 2) and Gaza Strip (n = 1). One pt was at the origin of a nosocomial outbreak (n = 4 pts) in a burn unit requiring the closure of the unit for outbreak control. Overall 3 pts dead but no attributable mortality to GPAB was observed. Not common origin could be established between the index pts of the 5 hospitals neither by epidemiological data nor PFGE analysis. Phenotypic resistance profile was difficult to distinguish from OXA-carbapenemase producing-AB. All isolates showed multiresistance including carbapenem (MICs to imipenem and meropenem ranging from 12 to >32 mg/L). Doripenem showed better activity with MICs from 3 to 32 mg/L. Only colistin remained susceptible in all isolates. Three different alleles (blaGES-11 from Turkey, Gaza and Egypt; blaGES-12 from Egypt and a new blaGES-14 from Turkey) were detected as part of an identical Class I integron including also aac6 Ib and dfrA7. No other ESBL or carbapenemase genes were detected except OXA-51-like which was present in each isolate but not downstream to ISAba1. By IEF, a band inhibited by clavulanic acid and corresponding to GES was visualized at pI of about 6. Conclusion: AB harboring blaGES-11 and blaGES-12 alleles were detected recently in France and in UK but were not yet reported elsewhere. The blaGES-14 variant is reported here for the first time in a pan-resistant AB isolate. This event further highlights the potential of acquisition of resistance genes by AB and the risk of travel import of multi-resistant bacteria with the possible subsequent inter/intra-hospital spread in acute care hospitals. Current emerging bacterial and viral infections S123 renders serology less suitable for diagnosing early disease. Alternative diagnostic approaches include an ELISA for IgM phase II antibodies as screening assay (M II screen). In addition, IS1111 PCR on serum samples is capable of diagnosing acute Q-fever before antibodies appear. In 2009, we introduced a diagnostic algorithm (figure) for acute Q-fever with the M II screen as initial step. Subsequently, IFA and/or PCR were performed depending on outcome of M II screen, date of onset of disease and inpatient or outpatient setting. When diagnostics were inconclusive a 14-day follow-up serum sample was requested. Here, we evaluated the value of the algorithm in an outbreak setting. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated outcome of Q-fever diagnostics according to the new algorithm in all patients referred between May 15th and 31st, 2009, with date of onset of disease unknown or <3 months. Results: In the 17-day period, 825 patients were tested. The diagnosis acute Q-fever was made in 256 patients (31%) \u2212 in 197 patients on the first serum sample, in 59 patients on the 14-day follow-up serum sample. A negative M II screen was obtained in 669/825 first serum samples resulting in reduction of IFAs performed by more than 80%. Ninety-two M II screen negative patients were diagnosed with acute Q-fever by positive PCR. Cross-reactivity was documented in 4% of patients with a positive M II screen. Almost 50% of physicians did not list date of onset of disease. Requested follow-up serum samples were not received from 306 patients leading to inconclusive outcomes. Conclusion: Introduction of the M II screen significantly reduced the number of IFAs performed, while introduction of PCR allowed for diagnosis of acute Q-fever in a substantial number of seronegative patients. Pitfalls to the presented algorithm are the poor communication by many physicians of the first day of disease, which is a critical component in the algorithm, and the suboptimal response to requests for follow-up serum samples implying that cases of acute Q-fever might have been missed. Objectives: To evaluate a new test that detect C. difficile \u2212enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase antigen (GDH) and toxin A/B in one step using the culture, like reference method; and to propose an algorithm for the routine diagnosis of CDAD. Methods: CDAD study was performed to 970 stool samples of patients more than 1 year old, between February and October 2009. It was studied: -Detection of GDH and Toxin A/B by ICT Techlab \u00ae C.diff Quick chek Complete (Inverness Medical) -Culture on CLO plates (Biomerieux). When GDH(+), toxin(\u2212) and culture(+): direct toxin detection from culture was performed. When GDH(+), toxin(\u2212) and culture(\u2212): spore selection by alcohol treatment was performed and cultured on CLO plates. Results: The 90.2% of samples were (\u2212) to GDH, toxin and culture (875); and the 3.4% (33) (+) to those parameters. The 4.8% (47) were GDH(+), toxin(\u2212) and culture(+), being the 48.9% (23/47) of those samples toxin(+) when direct toxin detection from culture was performed. The 1.3% (13) were GDH(+), toxin(\u2212) and culture(\u2212), recovering by alcohol treatment the 46.1% (6/13) of those samples, being the 15.4% (2/13) toxin(+). The 0.1% (1) was GDH(+), toxin(+) and culture(\u2212); and the 0.1% (1) GDH(\u2212), toxin(\u2212) and culture(+). The prevalence of toxigenic CD was 6.1%. The S, E, VPp and VPn of GDH compared to culture were: 98.7%, 97.9%, 81.6% and 99.8%. The algorithm purpose is: ",

Results: Among 2047 isolates, the four predominant types were 001 (n = 162; 8% of all isolates), 014 (n = 217; 11%), 027 (n = 305; 15%) and 078 (n = 205; 10%). Patients with types 014 and 078 were younger (age <65 years 39% and 35%, respectively) than patients with types 001 and 027 (26% and 22%, respectively). Type 027 patients less frequently had community associated (CA) CDI than patients with any of the 3 other types (8% vs. 19\u221225%). Use of clindamycin was a specific risk factor for type 001, when compared the other types (31% vs. 6\u22127%). Type 078 patients with complicated CDI were younger (<60 years) than patients with types 001, 014 and 027 (19%, vs. 0%, 9% and 11%, respectively).

CCHF virus possesses a negative-sense RNA genome consisting of three RNA segments: the large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments. For an arthropod-borne virus, the genomic plasticity of CCHF virus is surprisingly high. It seems likely that genetic reassortment may primarily occur during coinfection of ticks due to the transient nature of vertebrate infections relative to the long-term persistent virus infections seen in ticks and their obligate need to obtain blood meals at metamorphic junctures. Substantially, movement of genetic lineages of CCHF virus, particularly over greater distances and between regions not linked by livestock trade, likely also involves migratory animals or birds that are either infected or are carrying virus-infected ticks. Consequently, however migratory birds those mediate genetic lineages of CCHF exist critical point for CCHF struggle such as avian influenza, ticks should be targeted at first. Especially, fields with high risk should be out of order for pasturing and disinfected with repellent medicines.

The higher incidence of infection in men seems to be caused by the way of transmission and corresponds with other rodentborne zoonoses. Gender or pre-existing conditions did not influence the clinical presentation. Thrombocytopenia precedes organ failure and severe courses were associated with lower platelet levels. Platelet levels are therefore predictive for severe organ failure and, already early after the onset of first symptoms, a useful marker for identifying patients at risk for severe disease. Conclusion: Gender or pre-existing conditions did not influence the clinical presentation in hantavirus infected patients, however severe courses might be predicted for patients with low platelet levels. Objective: To study the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of broadspectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella oxytoca strains with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems isolated in an intensive care unit from a 200-bed community hospital. Methods: Nine K. oxytoca isolates recovered from clinical (4) and surveillance (5) cultures during a 3-month period were studied. Susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution and disc diffusion (CLSI). Phenotypic b-lactamase characterisation included screening and confirmatory test for ESBL, modified Hodge test for suspected carbapenemase production (CLSI), and isoelectrofocusing (IEF). b-lactamase genes were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. The clonal relationship among isolates was determined by PFGE with XbaI and cluster analysis was conducted by using UPGM with tolerance 1%. Results: All isolates were intermediate or resistant to b-lactams (amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and aztreonam), quinolones, trimethoprimsulphamethoxazole, tobramycin and tigecycline. Susceptibility was retained only to gentamicin, amikacin, colistin, and carbapenems (MIC of imipenem: 2 mg/L; MIC range of meropenem: 0.5\u22121 mg/L; MIC range of ertapenem: 1\u22122 mg/L). The nine isolates showed a negative double disc test for ESBL detection and a positive modified Hodge test for carbapenemase detection. IEF showed two bands per strain, one with pI slightly higher than 6.5 and another with pI of 8.2. All isolates showed an indistinguishable profile by PFGE (100% similarity). The gene encoding the metallo-b-lactamase IMP-8 was found in all isolates. In addition, all strains presented a G-to-A transition at position 5 of the \u221210 hexamer of the blaOXY promoter, which has been associated to an increased amount of b-lactamase produced (OXY-hyperproduction), explaining the resistance to aztreonam displayed by all strains. Conclusion: An outbreak caused by multi-drug resistant K. oxytoca in ICU patients from a community hospital was microbiologically characterised.

            "text": "Background: Worldwide emergence and spreading of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) is a matter of clinical concern. In Italy, a single KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolate was reported until now (Florence University Hospital, October 2008). Here we report the multifocal detection of KPC-positive nosocomial isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae obtained from inpatients admitted to different Italian hospitals during 2009. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using the VITEK2 system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and confirmed by the Etest method (bioM\u00e9rieux). Synergy tests based on EDTA and boronic acid were performed to screen for different carbapenem resistance mechanisms. Carbapenemase production was first studied by the modified Hodge test and then confirmed by PCR using primers specific for the detection of blaKPC-type alleles. Molecular typing was also performed to assess clonal relationship. Results: From May to October 2009, KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were detected in 5 Hospitals located in Northern Italy. Isolates showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype, including (in addition to b-lactams), fluoroquinolones, amikacin, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. MICs of ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem were 8 mg/L. Susceptibility was retained only for gentamicin, colistin, and tigecycline. Molecular typing showed the occurrence of few clones, although most of strains were clonally related. Epidemiological analysis revealed that two patients had been transferred among hospitals causing inter-hospitals transmission. Intrahospital diffusion was also observed. Conclusions: Following the first case reported in 2008, KPC-producing K. pneumoniae strains appear to be emerging in Italian hospitals. Due to the ability to rapidly spread, the multifocal detection of these strains is a finding of major concern. Monitoring and epidemiologic surveillance are therefore needed. From a therapeutic point of view, KPC-producing K. pneumoniae represent a new challenge for physicians and microbiologists. Based on in vitro results, colistin and tigecycline could represent therapeutic options for treating infections caused by these MDR pathogens.",

Nordmann (Le Kremlin Bicetre, FR) Objectives: KPC-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) are increasingly reported worldwide, mostly in the USA, Israel and Greece, and are associated with higher patient mortality. We report here the first nosocomial dissemination of KPC-Kp isolates mediated by a contaminated duodenoscope. Methods: KPC-Kp isolates were characterized by standard biochemical methods, by susceptibility testing, by PFGE, plasmid analysis, MLSTand transposon Tn4401-typing. Antibiotic resistance genes were sought by PCR and sequencing. Results: A 85-year old patient with bladder cancer, (hospital K-Bicetre, France) admitted for severe gastro-intestinal bleeding, underwent endoscopy to stop bleeding. Five days later, he was screened positive for KPC-Kp, resistant to all available antibiotics except gentamicin and colistin. Despite increased awareness and reinforced hygiene precautions, MDR screening of hospitalized patients in the same surgical unit identifed two KPC-Kp(+) patients. Concommitantly, a patient from a neighbouring hospital that underwent endoscopy at the same gastroenterology ward was diagnosed KPC-Kp positive. These patients had endoscopy on separate days (two weeks apart) but with the same endoscope. Bacterial cultures from this endoscope revealed KPC-Kp.Retrospective analysis of all the patients that had gastroscopy with the same endoscope, identified a Greek patient with KPC-Kp feacal carriage that was directly transferred from the hospital of Chania (Crete, Greece) two months earlier. Since this patient, 17 patients, being mostly from regional hospitals and out-patients, underwent gastroscopy with the same endoscope. Out of 10 patients that could be screened, 6 were KPCpositive and 2 got infected (one bacteriemia and one bilioma) with KPC-Kp. Conclusion: Although the risk of endoscopy-related infection is low, changes of endoscope reprocessing by replacing glutaraldehyde decontamination bath by automated per-acetic acid washers (to prevent Creutzfeldt-Jacob), may have been deleterious to this endoscope. This report identified he spread of a panresistant enterobacterial isolate in our hospital, and at a regional level in Paris. No combination of qnrD with other plasmid-mediated determinant of quinolone resistance was found. All qnrD genes were cloned by heat-shock in E. coli DH5a. They were all located in a conjugative plasmid, which was transferred into the E. coli J53 host strain and selected with 100 mg/ml of Na-azide and 0.5 mg/ml of ciprofloxacin. The ciprofloxacin resistance of the qnrD-producing clinical isolates carrying the plasmid-mediated determinants widely ranged between 0.06 and 256 mg/L. Conclusions: QnrD genes have so far been reported only from China, detected for the first time in Salmonella enterica and, subsequently, in E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This is the first report of the qnrD gene in Europe, as well as the first detection of this gene in isolates of the tribe Proteeae (namely P. mirabilis and M. morganii). This is also the first time that any qnr determinant is found in M. morganii.",

Other b-lactamase families were also identified, such as CMY-2 (n = 1), TEM-type (n = 60) and SHV-type (n = 35). IEF confirmed strains as ESBL producers. The association of blaCTX-M genes with other bla genes in the same isolate, namely blaTEM-1 or blaSHV-1, was observed. Multidrug resistance was presented especially with aminoglycosides family (72%). PMQR genes were detected only in 4 quinolone non-susceptible isolates: 3 K. pneumoniae strains had the aac(6 )-Ib-cr gene and 1 M. morganii strain had the recently described QnrD determinant. PFGE analysis revealed a high clonal heterogeneity (>80% similarity) among K. pneumoniae strains (23 unique profile types forming 6 clusters), S. marcescens (5 unique profiles types distributed by 2 clusters), and 2 S. typhimurium strains belonging to the same cluster.Conclusions: This study revealed the first report of a qnrD gene from an Algerian Hospital. Our work confirms also the geographic spread in Algeria of CTX-M-type b-lactamases, mainly CTX-M-15, and suggests the horizontal transfer of blaCTX-M genes, mediated by mobile elements.

We examined all 16S rRNA methylase containing Enterobacteriaceae from the Asia-Pacific region (2007) (2008) for the presence of PMQR and CTX-M-types, which are already known as a world-wide problem. Methods: Enterobacteriaceae collected from 10 countries as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program during [2007] [2008] showing elevated aminoglycoside resistance (amikacin MIC 64 mg/L, and gentamicin and tobramycin 16 mg/L) were tested for the 16S rRNA methylase genes (armA, rmtB, and rmtC) by real-time PCR. Isolates positive for 16S rRNA methylase genes were also screened for presence of PMQR genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6 )Ib-cr, qepA), and CTX-M encoding genes, using real-time PCR. Results: 16S rRNA encoding genes were detected in 209 of 4,161 isolates from 5 countries: China (107, 6.9%); India (71, 10.5%); Hong Kong (3, 1.5%); Korea (17, 6.1%), Taiwan (11, 5.0%), among 9 species. armA was found in 136 strains and rmtB in 60 strains; each were observed in all 5 countries. rmtC carrying isolates (n = 13) were only from India, observed in 5 species, where previously only described in Proteus mirabilis. 91.4% of all 16S rRNA methylase containing isolates also had either PMQR genes: qnr (n = 79, 38%); aac(6 )Ib-cr (n = 66, 32%); qepA (n = 20, 10%), or CTX-M genes (n = 158, 76%). qepA was found in India and China, exclusively with rmtB and predominantly in Escherichia coli. Multiple PMQR resistance mechanisms was surprisingly frequent, with 32 (15.3%) isolates containing two PMQR genes, predominantly qnr in combination with aac(6 )Ib-cr. Close to 50% of all 16S rRNA methylase containing isolates also harboured a PMQR gene in combination with CTX-M types. Conclusion: These results highlight the increasing problem of multipledrug resistance among clinical isolates in the Asia-Pacific region, and the importance of vigilant surveillance programs to monitor emerging resistance trends.",

Dionisi (Rome, Macerata, IT) Objective: Salmonella infantis represents the third serovar isolated in human infections in Europe, with the majority of strains susceptible to drugs. In Italy, since 2004, it is the fourth serovar isolated, and during 2005-2006 multidrug resistant strains emerged in a region of central Italy. In particular strains with R-type ACSSuTKmSxt were isolated in human, environment and food of animal origin. The aim of this work was to evaluate the clonal origin of multiresistant S. Infantis strains isolated from different sources; in addition with the purpose to analyze the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance, resistance gene cassettes were identified and their localization investigated. Methods: Seventy-two S. infantis strains, isolated between 2002-2008, both susceptible or resistant to antimicrobial drugs, were tested by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) according to Pulse-net protocol. Cluster analysis of PFGE profiles was performed using Bionumerics software. Strains with R-type ACSSuTKmSxt have been tested by PCR for the presence of the following gene cassettes: blaTEM, tetA-B-C-G, sul2, strA-B and class 1 integron. Conjugation experiments have been performed in order to establish the location of resistance genes. Plasmids from parental and transconjugant strains were assigned to incompatibility group by PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). Results: Cluster analysis performed on PFGE profiles showed a main cluster (genetic similarity >90%) including 49 strains, of which 27 with R-type ACSSuTKmSxt. All the 27 strains showed the following resistance genes: blaTEM, tetB, strA-B, sul2, conferring resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin and sulphonamides. In addition they harbour a class 1 integron of 2.2 Kb, including folA, catB3, aadA4, sul1 gene cassettes, which confer resistance to trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, streptomycin/spectinomicyn and sulphonamides. Conjugation experiments showed a unique plasmid harbouring all the resistance genes and belonging to HI1 incompatibility group. Objectives: Salmonella enterica is the most common etiological agent of food borne salmonellosis worldwide. Ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of these infections. Until date, fluoroquinolone resistance remains uncommon in this bacterium. However, the incidence of nalidixic acid resistance is increasing with isolates showing decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. We have screened a large collection of Salmonella strains to determine the incidence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and to further characterize the genotypic and phenotypic mechanisms that contribute to this MDR. Methods: From 2002 From -2009 Salmonella strains from Colombian foods and exotic animals were obtained from the University of Cordoba (Colombia). The serovar and the susceptibility profile of each strain were determined. Antibiotics representative of 8 different classes were tested and strains that demonstrated resistance to nalidixic acid (NA) were further characterized. PCR was performed to determine the presence of qnr genes. Additionally, efflux activity was evaluated by the EtBr-agar cartwheel method. Ex vivo studies were conducted to assess potential differences on the infection and adherence ability of the isolates.",

Thirteen isolates were resistant to NA (and/or other antibiotics). Four strains showed increased efflux activity when compared with the controls. This was further confirmed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration of NA in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor: phenylalaninearginine-b-napthylamide (PAbN). Resistance to quinolones was confirmed by PCR through the identification of the qnrB19 gene that confers low-level resistance to this class of antibiotics. Ex vivo assays were useful to clarify the infection and adherence potential of the isolates. Conclusion: In this study, a large collection of Salmonella isolates obtained from food and exotic animals were resistant to NA and/or other class of antibiotics. These isolates showed different serovars and increased efflux activity along with the presence of the qnrB19 gene. The ex vivo assays contributed to clarify the infection and adherence potential of the isolates. These data highlight the importance of intrinsic and acquired mechanisms of MDR in Salmonella. 2006-2007 (n = 787) were tested for MBL production using EDTA-double-disk synergy test and PCR assays for blaVIM and blaIMP genes. All MBL-producing isolates were typed by automated fluorescent MLVA; selected isolates of different MLVA clusters were typed by MLST. Structures of class 1 integrons carrying MBL-gene cassettes were analyzed using Taq I restriction endonuclease digestion of PCR fragments generated using outward primers internal to blaVIM or blaIMP genes and primers to 5 (intI1) and 3 (qacEdelta1 or tniC) conserved integron sequences. The obtained PCR-RFLP profiles were compared to those of the known integrons. Results: A total of 48 (4.6%) and 158 (20.1%) isolates collected, respectively, in 2002-2004 and in 2006-2007 were found to produce MBLs. During the first and second study periods MBL producers were identified correspondingly in 3 of 21 and 12 of 26 cities surveyed. By MLVA analysis, all MBL-positive isolates were distributed into two genetic clusters: the predominant one encompassing 23 related MLVA types and corresponding to sequence type (ST) 235 and a minor one comprised of 6 related MLVA types and corresponding to ST234. Isolates of the predominant genetic cluster carried 4 different MBL-integrons whose RFLP profiles matched those of the known integrons harboring blaVIM-2 (GenBank acc. nos. DQ522233 (n = 190), DQ522234 (n = 1), DQ522235 (n = 3)) and blaIMP-1 (DQ522237 (n = 3)). Isolates of the minor genetic cluster carried the blaVIM-2-containing integron (GenBank acc. no. DQ522236; n = 9). VIM-2-producing isolates of the two genetic groups have concomitantly increased in prevalence (ST235: from 4.5% to 18.1%; ST234: from 0.1% to 1.0%) and geographic distribution between the two study periods. (23), transthoracic needle aspiration specimen culture (5) and pleural fluid culture (1). b-lactamase production was detected in 25 (13%) of H. influenzae isolates. Patients with CAP due to H. influenzae were older (69.7 vs 65.9 years; p = 0.016), more often male (75% vs 68%; p = 0.033), had more commonly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (52% vs 26%; p 0.001), smoking history (67% vs 56%; p = 0.001) and were more frequently classified into high-risk pneumonia severity index (PSI) classes (group IV-V) (69% vs 57%; p = 0.001) than the remaining patients. They also had received more frequently prior corticosteroid therapy (10% vs 6%; p =.039) and pneumococcal vaccine (<5 years) (24% vs 15%; p = 0.001). Previous hospitalization (<1 year) for pneumonia was more common among patients with CAP due to H. influenzae (13% vs 7%; p = 0.002). Conversely, they were less likely to had pleural effusion (12% vs 18%; p = 0.049) and empyema (1% vs 4.3%; p = 0.028). No significant differences were found regarding time to clinical stability, length of hospital stay, and ICU admission. Early (0.5% vs 2.3%; p=.1) and 30-day mortality rates (4.7% vs 7.8%; p=.11) did not differ significantly between groups. Multivariate analysis identified COPD (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.8-3.5) and high-risk PSI classes (OR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.02-2.17) as independent risk factors for H. influenzae pneumonia. Conclusions: CAP caused by H. influenzae occurs mainly in patients with COPD classified into high-risk PSI classes and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.",

Although urinary antigen testing has facilitated the microbiological diagnosis during the acute-phase, only 52 of 99 microbiologically verified LDcases from a large outbreak in our region in 2005 tested positive. Previous attempts to design a clinical score have yielded conflicting results. The aim of our study was to assess clinical and biochemical predictors of Legionella pneumonia using outbreak patients. Methods: All patients with CAP referred to the regional hospital during a period of five weeks in May/June 2005 were included in the study. A clinical protocol was initiated during an early phase of the outbreak. Clinical and laboratory data on entry from patients with Legionella pneumonia and non-Legionella pneumonia were compared. Results: Complete data sets were present for 91 and 90 patients in the LD-group and non-LD group, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression Legionella pneumonia was associated independently with high levels of C-reactive protein (OR 1.009, 95% CI 1.005-1.013), presence of muscle pain (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.9), low serum sodium concentration (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98), and high body temperature (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.00-2.11). The continuous variables were dichotomized according to the optimal cut-off value. A simple predictive score was derived by assigning one point for each variable (CRP > 175 mg/L, presence of muscle pain, serum sodium <134 mmol/L, temperature >38.5 centigrades) resulting in a maximum of 4 points. The area under the receiver operator characteristic of the combined score was 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.90), which was better than each parameter alone. The median predictive score was higher in the Legionella group (2 (IQR 2-3) vs. 1 (IQR 1-2), p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of a score of 3 points was 65% and 92%, respectively, with corresponding values of 86% and 66% for a score of 2 points. In the subgroup of LD patients with negative Legionella urinary antigen test (n = 45), a score of 3 points and 2 points yielded nearly unaltered sensitivity of 67% and 82%, respectively. Conclusion: A simple score including four routine clinical and biochemical parameters can be used to predict Legionella as aetiological agent of pneumonia, including patients with a negative urinary antigen test. This score will be validated in an upcoming prospective CAP-study.",
