            "text": "In 2015, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reached the Republic of Korea, resulting from nosocomial transmission, and was the largest epidemic outside of the Arabian Peninsula. To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, there are only limited therapeutic options available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis in the primary assay, and selected 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-ofaddition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that eight and four therapeutics act on the early-and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the early acting drugs, three therapeutics with a TI greater than 100 were cardiotonic agents. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treatment of MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.",

Utilizing a Korean MERS-CoV patient isolate, we screened 5,406 compounds containing United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, bioactives, kinase inhibitors, and natural products; our library included 60% of all FDA-approved drugs (1,247 out of 2,069 total) (Fig. 1A) . Compounds were tested for their anti-MERS-CoV activity by determining the levels of the viral spike (S) protein expression of infected Vero cells by immunofluorescence analysis (IFA). Screening was conducted in two-times independently (screen 1 and screen 2) using chloroquine as a reference inhibitor at 100 \u03bcM for the maximum inhibitory concentration (IC90 = 93 \u03bcM) (De Wilde et al., 2014) . The calculated Z'-factor of >0.78 indicated a good separation of infected cells treated with the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control and chloroquine (Fig. 1B) . Two independent HCS analyses were further conducted (R 2 = 0.91) to select for hits that demonstrated a high degree of correlation between the two replicates. (Fig. 1C) .

In previously reported studies, small molecule libraries, including approximately 300 drugs with FDA-approval or in clinical development, were screened against MERS-CoV (De Wilde et al., 2014; Dyall et al., 2014) . Here, our screening included 1,247 FDA-approved drugs, which covers approximately 60% of all FDA-approved compounds. As a result, we identified drugs that were not found in previous studies, indicating that there are still opportunities for identifying novel FDAapproved drugs and bioactives by screening larger compound libraries. Moreover, we corroborated four previously identified hits, including emetine dihydrochloride, ouabain, cycloheximide, and nelfinavir mesylate. This strongly suggests that despite the use of different viral isolates, both our HCS assays and previously published screens reproducibly identified drugs that could be repurposed as potential therapeutic options for patients suffering CoV infections (Dyall et al., 2014) .",

Notably, however, glycosides have also been reported to possess antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus and human cytomegalovirus (Bertol et al., 2011; Kapoor et al., 2012) . Consistent with these previous studies, our data indicate that the cardiac glycosides, ouabain, digitoxin, and digoxin, efficiently inhibit MERS-CoV infection. Ouabain, in particular, has been found to block the entry stage of coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, through Src kinase signaling (Burkard et al., 2015) . Based on these data, we speculate that cardiac glycosides may generally act as anti-MERS-CoV agents through blockage of viral entry. However, more experimental work will be required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which this occurs.",

Therefore, Vero cells were treated with each drug at a concentration higher than its IC90 value, at 1 h prior to, or at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h post-infection (hpi). Viral infection was then quantified by IFA, as previously described (infected cells treated with 0.5% DMSO were normalized to 100% infection). Chloroquine, which was used as an early stage inhibitor control inhibited MERS-CoV infection up to 30% until 3 hpi but had no significant effect when administered at 4 hpi (Fig. 3) .

Drug concentrations were higher than the 90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) values of the drugs, and chloroquine was used as an early stage infection inhibitor control. Example images of MERS-CoV inhibition in Vero cells. The doseresponse curve (DRC) graph for lanatoside C is shown as a representative example to illustrate inhibition of MERS-CoV in Vero cells (A).
