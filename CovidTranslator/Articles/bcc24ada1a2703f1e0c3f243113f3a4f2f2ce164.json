            "text": "In recent years, many studies have drawn attention to the important role of collective awareness and human behaviour during epidemic outbreaks. A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources-Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive-to quantify populationscale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks. Data Availability Statement: Data are available from the Zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10. 5281/zenodo.3603916). data, and we compare it with mentions of Zika in US news outlets and TV shows. We also compare the collective attention received by the outbreak with the incidence of Zika reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in each state. We find that the attention dynamics was highly synchronized across states, irrespective of the local risk of transmission of the virus. By building a linear regression model, we show that the dynamics of collective attention is highly predictable, even at state level, only based on the national media coverage received by the outbreak.",

A 2013 study [2] found that 59% of U.S. adults had looked for health information on the Web in the previous year and that about one in three U.S. adults use the Internet to figure out what medical condition they have. The fruition of news sources, either traditional such as television, radio and newspapers, or digital such as Web news or online social networks, has become crucial in how health information is delivered and it can play a fundamental role in shaping opinions, awareness and behaviours. In the past ten years, several studies have addressed the impact of awareness and information spread during epidemic outbreaks and it has been reported that the degree of public attention and concern induced by an epidemic threat might affect the disease transmission dynamics [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, modeling efforts have been mostly theoretical and a large-scale empirical characterization of the adoption of health protective behaviours, either induced by information spread or media exposure, and its interplay with the disease dynamics during an epidemic outbreak has been elusive so far due to the lack of available data [8] .",

Infection is mostly asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms [9] but it can lead to serious and sometimes fatal neurological defects in neonates born to ZIKV infected women. In particular, following the association between ZIKV and a cluster of microcephaly cases in Brazil [10] , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ZIKV epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on February 1st, 2016 [11] . The emergency lasted until November 18th 2016, when the WHO declared the PHEIC to be over [12] . As of March 2017, ZIKV has spread worldwide to 79 countries where there has been evidence of an ongoing vector-borne virus transmission. The most affected region has been the American continent with 47 countries or territories reporting local ZIKV transmission, due to the extensive presence of Aedes mosquitoes in almost all the region's countries [13] . In such epidemiological context, the ZIKV epidemic has posed peculiar communication challenges to the public due to its association with microcephaly in newborns, its transmission modalities, and its prevalence in areas where the virus was never detected before and that was suddenly characterized by intense international travel due to the 2016 Summer Olympics [13] [14] [15] .",

The novelty of the disease and the lack of previous knowledge of it in the affected areas make the 2016 ZIKV epidemic an ideal case study to characterize collective attention patterns, identify their drivers and test traditional modeling assumptions. Intuitively, mass media coverage represents the main driver of public attention during an epidemic. Indeed, several peculiarities of media narratives around public health hazards [18] and infectious diseases [19] have been elucidated, but a general and quantitative comprehension of how the public opinion responds to media exposure during an emerging epidemic threat is still lacking. The majority of modeling studies assume that media exposure is driving behavioural changes, hence media exposure effects are incorporated into some kind of media function that modulates individual behaviors and may affect disease dynamics [20] [21] [22] . The general assumption is that as the number of cases increases and is reported by mass media, the susceptibility of individuals will decrease due to increasing awareness and the associated behavioral changes [21] . However, for most disease outbreaks, such modeling assumptions have never been supported by direct empirical evidence.",

The daily timeline of Wikipedia pageviews ( Fig  1A) highlights two distinct peaks of attention in 2016: the first, in the beginning of February 2016, corresponding to the international alert raised by the WHO and by the CDC at national level; the second, in August 2016, corresponding to the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which attracted significant attention due to the health concerns for athletes and the related risk of case importation. Such spikes of attention visibly correspond to similar spikes in the media coverage profiles, both in the TV coverage of the epidemic ( Fig 1B) and in the Web news coverage of Zika ( Fig 1C) . The three time series are indeed highly correlated, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.74, (p < 10 \u22124 ), for the Wikipedia pageviews and the Web news time series, and r = 0.80, (p < 10 \u22124 ), for the Wikipedia attention and the TV coverage (see S2 Table in the Supporting Information) .",

The number of new ZIKV cases in the United States reported by the CDC every week (Fig 1D) gradually increased from the beginning of 2016 until the summer, with a peak between the end of August and the beginning of September. Notifications of new cases declined afterwards. Summer 2016 was also characterized by the first reports of local ZIKV transmission in Florida and in Texas, events that were also responsible for an increased news coverage of Zika. However, the surge of reported ZIKV cases in the United States did not result in an increased level of attention with respect to the initial spike observed at the beginning of the outbreak. The epidemic profile is indeed not correlated with the timeline of Wikipedia pageviews (r = \u22120.15, p = 0.26) or the media coverage profiles (r = 0.04, p = 0.80 for TV and r = 0.10, p = 0.47, for Web news). Such dynamics of public attention can be ascribed to the initial novelty of the outbreak, which was presented as a novel and serious health threat even in the presence of a small number of imported cases. As the extension of the outbreak and the associated risks became clearer to the public, the interest of Americans in looking for additional information on Wikipedia faded over the course of the year, with relatively smaller increments linked to important events such as the Olympics. Such observation is consistent with the presence of a memory effect in the dynamics of Wikipedia pageviews: individuals retain information for some time before their attention toward a topic is elicited again by novel events or anniversaries [24, 25] .",

Although the relative risk of case importation and local transmission varied significantly from state to state, being the Southern States more at risk due to vector's presence and abundance [26] , the Wikipedia pageview timelines were all highly correlated, as shown in Fig 2. The Pearson correlation coefficient of the cross-correlation matrix of Wikipedia pageview time series by State ranges from r = 0.77 (p < 10 \u22124 ) for Delaware and Montana, to r = 0.99 (p < 10 \u22124 ) for New York and New Jersey. Overall, the correlation of the Wikipedia pageviews in each state with the national timeline was always higher than r = 0.88 (p < 10 \u22124 ), indicating a high degree of spatial uniformity across the country. Given the above mentioned correlation of Wikipedia pageviews with the TV coverage of the epidemic and the mentions of Zika on the Web, the attention patterns at State level were also highly correlated with the national media coverage suggesting a fundamental role of news exposure as a driver of public attention at all geographic scales.",

We tested these hypotheses by comparing Wikipedia pageview counts in each state to Web news mentioning the word \"Zika\" and the name of the state, and to the local ZIKV incidence profiles. Attention profiles in each state were generally positively correlated to Web news mentioning the name of the state, however the degree of correlation ranged from r = 0.004 (p = 0.98) in Wisconsin to r = 0.75 (p < 10 \u22124 ) in Texas, showing significant spatial differences across the country (see S3 Table in the Supporting Information) . Interestingly, ZIKV incidence in each state could explain such geographic variations as a negative driver of attention. On the one hand, local patterns of attention in each state were generally not correlated with disease incidence, with the exception of Montana (r = 0.33, p = 0.02), as shown in S4 Table of the Supporting Information. On the other hand, Web news covering Zika in each state were positively correlated with the local incidence profiles (r > 0.20) only in 13 states out of 50 (see S5 Table  in the Supporting Information) and, at the same time, these states showed the smallest degree of correlation between news and attention. A direct comparison of the 50 states ranked by degree of correlation between news and ZIKV incidence, and between news and attention, showed a negative rank correlation: weighted Kendall's \u03c4 = \u22120.25 [27] . Overall, in those states where local news were following more closely the local epidemic patterns, the dynamics of public attention was not driven much by news. Instead, local attention patterns followed more closely the state news where the latter was more similar to the national one and less correlated with the local ZIKV epidemiology.",

To answer this question, we examined the attention to ZIKV in 788 cities of the United States with a population larger than 40,000 and compared it to their total Wikipedia viewership. By ranking the U.S. cities based on their total volume of Wikipedia pageviews in 2016, and comparing such ranking with the one based on pageviews of Zika-related articles only, we identified locations where the attention to ZIKV was higher than expected. As shown in Fig 3A, cities on the East Coast of Florida showed the highest relative attention to ZIKV, when compared to their overall Wikipedia activity. Other relevant outliers with high attention were cities in Texas and in the Northeast. On the contrary, the lowest attention to ZIKV was observed in cities in California, and in the Midwest (Fig 3B) . These results suggest that increases in public attention at city level may be explained by risk perception due to the presence of the vector (as in Florida and Texas). However, the high level of attention in other places, such as Union City, NJ, can not be easily explained by epidemiological risk factors and it may be due to specific events, such as one or more case importations, that do not appear in our dataset.",

Despite its simplicity, this equal-time linear regression demonstrates that both media signals, taken independently, are already quite informative of the Zika populationrescaled pageview time series: using exclusively TV close captions we obtain R 2 = 0.61 and r = 0.80, while using only Web news we obtain R 2 = 0.52 and r = 0.78.

Collective attention to the ZIKV outbreak thus seems to have been mainly driven by news exposure and much less by the disease transmission dynamics, although the epidemic profile of ZIKV infections varied significantly from state to state and the risk of local transmission was not uniform across the country. Such picture describes a scenario where the awareness of the epidemic in the country is globally present, while local effects, as those due to the local spreading of awareness, play a less important role, following the terminology first introduced by Funk et al.

The impact of media exposure on the collective awareness and risk perception during epidemic outbreaks has been investigated in previous works [18, 19, 33] , however, only a few studies have attempted to quantitatively measure the effect of media engagement on epidemic awareness using empirical data from Web sources on a large scale [22, 34, 35] . While previous studies have focused on newspaper coverage of epidemics [36] , we investigated the relationship between the exposure to TV coverage and online news, and the attention to Wikipedia pages. Our study confirms the high sensitivity of Wikipedia searches to breaking news and official announcements, in particular in the case of disaster events, as found by previous studies [37, 38] . On the other hand, the temporal dynamics of Wikipedia pageviews during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic showed a nonlinear dependence with media coverage: the Wikipedia pages activity was high in the initial phases of the outbreak, but it declined more quickly than media coverage. This can be explained by the fact that information on Wikipedia is rather static, and users will view Wikipedia pages immediately after the news breaks but they will not return in the next days, unless more recent events renew their attention [37] . Although assuming that collective attention follows media coverage is rather plausible, a Granger-causality analysis did not evidence a preferential causal relationship between pageviews and news sources. On the other hand, our data support an instantaneous causal relationship between Wikipedia readership and media coverage, suggesting that nowcasting Wikipedia pageviews based on the volume of media coverage is feasible.",

In general, media coverage was influenced by several factors, and only to a lesser extent by the progression of the epidemic. Although from a journalist's perspective, it may be expected that news did not necessarily follow the number of ZIKV cases, such result highlight the limitations of several behavioral epidemic models that incorporate media effects. Indeed, choices made by journalists regarding newsworthiness of specific aspects related to ZIKV infection affected the level of knowledge and familiarity in the US population [39] . Also, the media narrative around ZIKV evolved over time, as found in a recent study by Yotam Ophir [40] . The content of the ZIKV news coverage shifted from focusing on scientific themes, at the beginning of the outbreak, to the description of social disruptions during the Summer Olympics. Since we did not examine the textual content of news items in our dataset, further research should identify specific themes emerging from media outlets that are most significantly associated to Wikipedia viewership during epidemic outbreaks. Also, we relied on the automatic tagging system provided by GDELT to identify news items mentioning Zika. However, the classification algorithm may have limitations and some items could be less relevant than others. Further research should assess the quality of the GDELT news tagging algorithm in the specific case of epidemic outbreaks [41] . Another limitation of our analysis is that we considered the content of mass media outlets only, and did not look into other news sources, such as online social networks. However, social media often provide an amplification channel for traditional media sources and online users consume information that is not very different from what appears on mass meda [42] .",

Previous studies have used TV viewing data to infer the behavioral response during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic in Mexico [58] . More recently, Poletto el al. [35] showed that an increased collective attention was correlated to changes in the hospital management of MERS-Cov patients, reducing the time from admission to isolation. Further research is needed to infer causal patterns between collective attention and behavioral responses, and to identify the most suitable approach to integrate them into disease-behavior models.",
