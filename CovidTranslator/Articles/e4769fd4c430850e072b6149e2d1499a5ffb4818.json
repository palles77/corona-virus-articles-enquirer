In recent years, reestablishment of PV circulation in countries where PV was previously eliminated has occurred because of decreased herd immunity, possibly due to poor vaccination coverage. To monitor the vulnerability of countries to PV circulation, surveillance of neutralizing-antibody titers against PV in susceptible populations is essential in the end game of the polio eradication program. In this study, we have developed a PV neutralization test with type 1, 2, and 3 PV pseudoviruses to determine the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV in human serum samples. With this test, the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV could be determined within 2 days by automated interpretation of luciferase signals without using infectious PV strains. We validated the pseudovirus PV neutralization test with 131 human serum samples collected from a wide range of age groups (ages 1 to >60 years) by comparison with a conventional neutralization test. We found good correlation in the neutralizing-antibody titers determined by these tests. These results suggest that a pseudovirus PV neutralization test would serve as a safe and simple procedure for the measurement of the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV.",

In the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Polio Laboratory Network, PV isolation and identification have been performed at WHO national polio laboratories in a cell culture system (18, 19) , followed by differentiation of the isolates into oral PV vaccine (OPV)-related PV, vaccine-derived PV (VDPV), and wildtype PV isolates by several methods at WHO regional reference laboratories (12, 19) . Surveillance of PV is essential for monitoring the progress of PV eradication in countries where PV is endemic (4 countries as of 2011) and for the maintenance of the polio-free status of countries where PV is not endemic by preventing circulation of imported PVs or VDPVs from countries where PV is endemic through proper vaccination campaigns.",

In laboratories, the neutralizing-antibody titer has been determined by a conventional PV neutralization test (cPNT) using a susceptible cell culture system and infectious challenge virus (20) . Characteristic requirements for a cPNT are as follows: (i) use of infectious virus (usually OPV strains are used), (ii) expertise of personnel (for observation of cytopathic effect [CPE] in inoculated cells), and (iii) extended time for results (5 to 7 days of culture). In Japan, surveillance of neutralizing antibody against PV has been performed every 2 or 3 years since 1974 for serum samples from healthy volunteers (about 1,100 to 1,800 individuals in 6 to 8 prefectures) in a wide range of ages (0 to \u03fe40 years) based on cPNTs in prefectural laboratories (http://idsc.nih.go.jp/yosoku /Polio/Year-P2009.html) (9) . Considering the biosafety and expertise required for the test, a PV neutralization test that is safer and simpler than cPNT would be desirable in the end game of the eradication program.",

Different titers of PV pseudoviruses (200, 400, and 800 IU) were incubated with standard anti-PV sera (monkey antisera containing 13 units of neutralizing-antibody titer in 5 l against type 1, 2, or 3 PV Sabin strains). Neutralization was performed at 4\u00b0C overnight according to the conditions used in cPNT. Standard anti-PV sera showed specific neutralization of corresponding types of PV pseudovirus in the range of titers of PV pseudoviruses. Similar neutralization curves were observed in a range of titers of PV pseudoviruses for all the serotypes. The neutralizing activity of the standard serum against type 1 PV pseudovirus was lower than those against type 2 and type 3 PV pseudoviruses. Luciferase signals in the inoculated cells with 200, 400, and 800 IU of PV pseudoviruses were 1.2 \u03eb 10 7 to 1.5 \u03eb 10 7 cps, 2.7 \u03eb 10 7 to 3.3 \u03eb 10 7 cps, and 4.7 \u03eb 10 7 to 5.4 \u03eb 10 7 cps, with standard deviations of 13 to 15%, 7.5 to 14%, and 8.4 to 12% of the means, respectively. In this range of titers of PV pseudoviruses (200 to 800 IU), consistent results were obtained in the specificity and neutralization curves. Therefore, we determined that 400 IU of PV pseudoviruses was the optimal titer to give consistent results in pPNT. A summary of the procedure of pPNT with interpretation is shown in Fig. 2 .",

Threshold values for each type of PV were determined by comparison with the results obtained by cPNT to give the anti-PV neutralizingantibody-positive rates of samples (the percentage of samples that showed neutralizing-antibody titers of \u05468) closest to those determined by cPNT (Fig. 3A) . The background signals in the tests corresponded to approximately 0.83% PV pseudovirus infection (standard deviation, 0.72%). Therefore, we could not set the threshold values below 2.5% PV pseudovirus infection for type 2 PV because of the high fluctuation near the background level.

Pseudotyped viruses, especially enveloped viruses that require a high biosafety level for containment (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV], lyssaviruses, Nipah virus, and highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses), have been widely used in neutralization tests because of their safety (6, 7, 16, 17, 21) . The advantages of pPNT compared to cPNT are as follows: (i) biosafety (pPNT uses non-self-proliferating PV pseudovirus versus infectious PV strains), (ii) simplicity of procedures (automated luciferase assay and interpretation versus observation requiring expertise), and (iii) shortened time to results (2 days versus 5 to 7 days). Moreover, pPNT requires less human serum than is required for cPNT (25 l versus 200 l) and thus could contribute to saving precious human serum resources to be used for biological tests. In the end game of the polio eradication program, biosafety and reduced burden in laboratory tests would have more importance than in areas where polio is endemic.",

            "text": "We observed good correlation in the overall results obtained by cPNT and pPNT for all types of PV. For pseudovirus neutralization tests, threshold values arbitrarily set in a range of 10 to 50% generally gave results that had good correlation with those obtained by conventional tests, especially for determining the neutralization-antibody-positive rates (6, 16, 17) . Finetuning of threshold values might have benefit for linking the results obtained by different neutralization methods (e.g., suppression of CPE that could arise from 1 infectious unit of virus versus overall suppression of pseudovirus infection to threshold values). Therefore, we set the threshold values of pPNT in a range of the values examined for each type of PV to give antibody-positive rates closest to those obtained by cPNT (Fig.  3 ). PV pseudoviruses with capsid proteins derived from different strains in the same serotype (e.g., capsid proteins of the Sabin strain versus those of wild-type strains) might have different fine-tuned threshold values, in part depending on the variation in antigenicity and on the properties of the set of human sera examined without an absolute standard neutralizing antibody. The herd immunity required for PV elimination has been predicted to be about 80 to 97% from a circulation model, depending on the level of hygiene (5) (10) . A neutralizing-antibody titer of \u05468 is considered to have a protective effect against paralytic poliomyelitis (reviewed in reference 13). Therefore, a wide range of threshold values (5 to 30% for type 1 PV, 2.5 to 10% for type 2, and 5.0 to 20% for type 3) in pPNT could be practically acceptable to estimate antibody-positive rates with an accuracy within 10% of those determined by cPNT. We used type 1, 2, and 3 PV pseudoviruses that have capsid proteins of PV1 Mahoney , PV2 MEF-1 , and PV3 Saukett A , respectively, for pPNT. These PV strains are virulent and are currently used as antigens of inactivated PV vaccine (IPV) (11) . PV consists of 3 serotypes (14), although some antigenic variation could occur within each serotype after long circulation (for \u03fe10 years) (3). Therefore, to evaluate the neutralizing antibodies to wild-type PV strains, these PV pseudoviruses would have more benefit than using infectious PV vaccine strains. For neutralizing-antibody titers for type 1 PV, the overall results were consistent between cPNT and pPNT (Fig.  3) . However, there was an age-dependent difference in the distribution of the titers: lower titers for the younger group and higher titers for the elderly group by pPNT (Fig. 4) . In Japan, poliomyelitis outbreaks caused by wild-type strains mainly occurred before 1962 (\u03fe90% of the total reported cases from 1947 to date), before the introduction of OPV in 1961. Therefore, it is plausible that sera from the elderly group (\u054660 years old; birth years before 1950) have higher neutralization activity against wild-type strains than vaccine strains. The low titers against type 1 PV observed by pPNT in the younger group Neutralization curve of PV pseudoviruses with a human serum sample. The threshold levels for determination of the neutralizing-antibody titer are shown by the dotted lines (\u054520%, 2.5%, and 10% for type 1, 2, and 3 PV, respectively), with neutralizing-antibody titers circled (64, 32, and 128 for type 1, 2, and 3 PV, respectively). (Bottom) Original data for the neutralization curve shown at the top. The wells that showed the highest dilution below the threshold values in two lines of measurement are circled. The wells that showed the highest dilutions below the threshold values in the measurement are indicated by arrows for each type of PV pseudovirus. suggested that antibodies induced by OPV apparently have higher titers for the vaccine strain than the parental PV1 Mahoney strain or other type 1 attenuated strains (CHAT) (4, 8) . Standard serum (monkey antisera raised against each Sabin strain) also showed relatively low neutralizing activity against type 1 PV pseudovirus compared to those against type 2 and 3 PV pseudoviruses (Fig. 1) . Different levels of neutralizing-antibody titer against type 1 PV strains might have arisen The neutralizing-antibody-positive rates of the samples were determined for each threshold value and are shown above the graphs. The threshold values that showed neutralizing-antibody-positive rates closest to those obtained by cPNT are highlighted with color for each type of PV (green, 20%; blue, 2.5%; and red,10% for type 1, 2, and 3 PV, respectively). (B) Scatter plots of neutralizing-antibody titers obtained by cPNT and pPNT. The threshold values used in pPNT were 20%, 2.5%, and 10% for type 1, 2, and 3 PV, respectively. The numbers of the serum samples in the corresponding spots are visualized by the sizes of the circles, along with the number of the sample for each spot when more than one sample was in the same spot. The regression line (red), 95% confidence interval (green), and 95% prediction interval (blue) of the analyses are shown.",
