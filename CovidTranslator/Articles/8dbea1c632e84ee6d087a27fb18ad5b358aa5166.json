It has emerged in the past 20 years in the European Endangered Species Program (EEP) cheetah population and represents a serious threat to a sustainable captive European cheetah population. 28 To date, more than 60 cases have been registered in at least 16 different locations in Europe and in Dubai (United Arab Emirates), resulting in the euthanasia of numerous cheetahs that were part of the EEP breeding program. This disease accounts for 25% of all deaths in the European cheetah population and represents a limiting factor in the growth of the European captive population. Cheetahs of every age group are affected, and often several or all cheetahs of the same litter will eventually develop the disease, either simultaneously or successively over several months or years.",

Further characterization W orldwide, cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in captivity develop a number of health problems rarely observed in free-ranging cheetahs and unusual in other species, especially felids. These include diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) as well as non-CNS diseases. Among the neurologic diseases, cheetah ataxia, caused by a degenerative spinal cord disorder affecting young and adult cheetahs, represents a serious threat to a sustainable captive cheetah population in Europe. Furthermore, several cases of feline spongiform encephalopathy have been diagnosed in European cheetahs. Although the disease has been reported in several large cat species, the relatively high incidence in cheetahs suggests that they may be more susceptible than other zoo felids. In North America, leukoencephalopathy is an emerging neurologic disease of unknown cause and has had a major impact on the Species Survival Plan (SSP) captive breeding program through loss of important founders.",

The proper fascicle usually is largely spared, and the dorsal tracts are affected only in a few cases, generally older animals. The degenerative lesions are characterized by ballooning of myelin sheaths, either devoid of axons or containing intact or fragmented axons or macrophages (gitter cells, myelinophages). On the longitudinal sections, intact or slightly swollen axons are often seen within dilated myelin sheaths. Spheroids are observed rarely. Depending on the severity and duration of the lesions, myelin sheath vacuolation is associated with varying degrees of astrogliosis, characterized by gemistocytes and proliferation of fibrous processes. Considering the presence of intact axons within dilated myelin sheaths, the lack of features typical for early axonal degeneration, and the excess of myelin loss compared with axonal degeneration, the white matter lesion has been classified as a primary myelin disorder. 26, 29 However, based on ultrastructural studies, other authors suggest that demyelination must be considered secondary to axonal degeneration. 14",

Considering that the cheetah myelopathy has never been reported within the North American, South African, or Japanese populations, and in view of the similar genetic base of these cheetah populations, extrinsic factors, either related to the management or the environment, must be considered.

Additionally, the pattern of incidence does not indicate a genetic basis for this disease. However, a genetic component to general disease predisposition and response cannot be ruled out, and anticipation of multifactorial inheritance might play a role. 2 In view of the phenotypic similarities of the diseases in the EEP cheetah population with human mitochondrial DNA-associated diseases, the cheetah mitochondrial genome was analyzed to investigate a possible extrachromosomal genetic basis for the myelopathy. One heteroplasmic and two homoplasmic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mitochondrial complex I of cheetahs with and without neurodegenerative diseases were identified. However, a correlation between these SNPs and the myelopathy could not be demonstrated. 4 Known nutritional myelopathy entities include swayback and enzootic ataxia in sheep and goats caused by copper deficiency, 31 equine degenerative myelopathy due to a presumed vitamin E deficiency, 23 degenerative myelopathy related to vitamin B 12 deficiency in humans 8, 15 and cat, 20 and hound dog ataxia associated with possible methionine deficiency. 21 As noted earlier, the first cases of cheetah ataxia were described in South Africa in 1981, 3 then later in two litters in The Netherlands. 32 The disease was ascribed to copper deficiency, based on the copper measurement in the organs and because one cheetah completely recovered after copper supplementation. It is not clear from the description of the cases, however, whether pathologic lesions were similar to the later outbreaks. This copper deficiency hypothesis could not be confirmed by other authors or in my experience. Although a significant difference in liver copper level has been shown between cheetahs and dogs and cats, there was no significant difference in the serum copper level. 29 Again, this difference in the liver copper levels could be explained by the domestic animals mainly being fed with supplemented industrial food.",

FSE has been reported in several nondomestic cat species, including cheetah, puma, ocelot, tiger, lion, and cougar, but the relatively high prevalence in cheetahs suggests that they may be more susceptible than other zoo felids. To date, nine cases of FSE have been diagnosed in cheetahs. 1, 10, 11, 17, 25 All affected cheetahs were older than 5 years, and with the exception of two cheetahs born in France, all were either born in the United Kingdom or imported from there. Clinically, chronic progressive ataxia initially involves the hind limbs but later progresses to involve the forelimbs. Further clinical signs appear with variable frequency and include postural difficulties, hypermetria, muscle tremors (particularly affecting the head), changes in behavior (e.g., increased aggressiveness, anxiety), hyperesthesia and hyperreaction to sounds, ptyalism, prominent nictitating membranes, and blindness. The clinical signs usually develop over about 8 weeks. One affected female had a litter when the clinical signs appeared, but she continued to suckle the cubs throughout the disease period until she was humanely euthanized. One of the three cubs later developed the disease at age 6 years. The diagnosis of FSE requires histopathologic examination of the brain and the finding of characteristic vacuolation. It is broadly accepted that FSE is the result of BSE infection in felids, and the incubation period appears to be 4.5 to 8 years in cheetahs. However, the occurrence of FSE in the offspring of an affected cheetah in France raises the possibility of vertical transmission.",

A preliminary pedigree analysis showed that all affected cubs have common ancestors. However, a pure genetic cause is unlikely because the same ancestors also appear frequently in the lineage of unaffected snow leopards in other institutions. 7, 18, 19 The first spinal cord disorder was diagnosed in a snow leopard litter at a French zoo. At age 3 to 5 weeks, the three cubs of the litter showed clinical neurologic symptoms characterized by head and body tremors and swaying gait, followed by inability to stand and paresis of the hind limbs. Additional clinical findings were loss of body weight and a shaggy hair coat. Because of the progression of the neurologic signs, all three cubs were euthanized at age 9 to 11 weeks and submitted to necropsy. Histopathologic investigations of the nervous system revealed lesions characterized by chromatolytic neurons in the spinal cord, predominantly in the proprioceptive nucleus thoracicus in the proximal lumbar segments. Distinct myelin sheath dilation and axonal degeneration were observed in the corresponding thoracic and cervical ascending spinocerebellar tracts. No changes were seen in the brain, spinal ganglia, and peripheral nerves. The cause of this spinal disorder remains unknown, and no further ancillary procedures were performed.

            "text": "The etiology of this second spinal disorder remains unknown, but it seems important to note that the snow leopards in the Swiss zoo and in the two French institutions were fed with chicken only. Two of these institutions changed the diet to a variety of different meats, supplemented with vitamins and trace elements. The cubs born in these zoos after the diet change did not develop neurologic signs, whereas at the third zoo, which continued to feed chicken, the cubs born were again affected. This may be indicative of a vitamin B or other nutritional deficiency as the cause of the degeneration of the spinal cord in the snow leopard cubs in these facilities.",

The necropsy revealed a compression of the spinal cord by a mycotic abscess at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. Microbiologic culture performed on the abscess material revealed the growth of Cladophialophora bantiana. Neurologic diseases resulting from fungal infection are uncommon in human and domestic cats, but further cases of saprophytic infection involving the CNS have previously been reported in snow leopards. Extramedullary thoracolumbar fungal abscesses, caused by Scopulariopsis brumptii, were diagnosed in two young snow leopards, 5 and an Aspergillus terreus meningoencephalitis was reported in a neonatal cub. 16 It has been suggested that snow leopards may be more susceptible to infectious agents present in more temperate climates, because of a relative lack of exposure to infectious organisms in their natural habitat. 30 ",
