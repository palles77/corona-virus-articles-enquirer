This result shows that a plot of the mass fractions could be used to observe relative concentrations directly from the ratios. Furthermore, instrument parameters and response factors appear to have less influence than expected. However, previously it was shown that with a similar instrument, larger species give more intense signals [1] . Also here, the tested nsp's (~9.5-15 kDa) may have different ion efficiencies than larger species, e.g. nsp7-10 and M pro (~59 kDa and ~69 kDa), and should therefore not be compared directly.

The ratio of mass fraction (MF) is the SR ratio, corrected for all non-covalent complexes (AVG.\u00b1SD, N=3; 23\u00b13%, 26\u00b13%, 24\u00b13% and 28\u00b13%). Figure S 9: Gas-phase dissociation pathways of nsp7+8(2:2). Two alternative dissociation pathways of SARS-CoV tetramer and interaction of subunits within the tetramer as concluded from CID spectra. Main pathway (top): Initially, nsp7+8(2:2) dissociates into nsp7 and nsp7+8(1:2), suggesting a peripheral positioning of nsp7 within the complex. In a follow-up dissociation, nsp7+8(1:1) is detected at elevated collisional energy. Alternative pathway (bottom): At higher collisional energy, dissociation into nsp8 and nsp7+8(2:1) is preferred. nsp8 dimers appear as well. Interaction map: Subunit interactions as concluded from CID-MS results. Symbols illustrate molecular ions from different mass species found as dissociating ions in CID. Black arrows indicate for the ejected ions. Dashed arrows indicate for unobserved dissociations that most likely follow up. Charge states labelled taken from dissociating ions found in CID of SARS-CoV nsp7+8 (2:2) (+14) and when combined match the charge state of the precursor ion.",
