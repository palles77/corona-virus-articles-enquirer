Biological recognition is dominated by intermolecular interactions and it is generally accepted that not only steric but also complementary electronic properties of the involved species play a distinctive role in this process. 1, 2 Whereas steric information can be provided by various methods, for example, by the determination of the molecular structure from a conventional X-ray diffraction experiment using the spherical independent atom model (IAM ), electronic properties can be ob-tained from high-resolution X-ray data at low temperatures followed by an aspherical electron density modelling of the structure. For aspherical atom modelling, the Hansen and Coppens multipole formalism is commonly used that describes the asphericity of an atomic electron density by a sum of spherical harmonic density functions. 3 In addition to intramolecular atomic and bonding properties, experimental electron density (ED) distributions contain information on weak intermolecular interactions in the crystal. For example, the electrostatic potential can be derived, being one of the most important properties in the study of molecular reactivity and the analysis of molecular association, which follows the so called principle of electrostatic complementarity. 1,4-6 ED properties in the crystal can serve in a first approximation as a model for the interactions under biological conditions, since the same types of effects as the ligand-target interactions should exist in this environment (e.g., steric, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, van-der-Waals effects), and these are expected to be comparable in size. 2, 7 In this respect, experimental ED properties are much better suited to simulate physiological conditions than those from theoretical gas phase calculations on isolated molecules. 2 Several experimental advances have taken place in ED research in the last decade. 8 Since the ED of a chemical structure consists of 0968-0896/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To meet these demanding experimental conditions the appearance of CCD area detectors in the mid-1990s and the availability of an increasing number of highly intense synchrotron beamlines of the third generation have contributed substantially. 9 Nevertheless, there still exist some limitations for a broad application of experimental ED work in the life sciences, where at least two major problems have to be addressed.",

            "text": "(i) In medicinal chemistry, especially in drug development, it is common practise to screen over a large number of compounds to identify their potential activity. This makes also ED studies on series of molecules in short time periods necessary. (ii) Important biological molecules are macromolecules (proteins, polynucleotides), of which ED studies are known only in extremely rare cases. [10] [11] [12] [13] The above mentioned experimental advances have led to a dramatic reduction of X-ray exposure time to a few hours or even minutes per data collection so that in combination with methodical and computational developments the examination and quantitative analysis of series of ED distribution seems feasible already at present. 14 For macromolecules, a generally lower crystal quality, ubiquitous disorder, large amount of solvent in the crystal structure, cause altogether limited diffraction properties, so that these compounds are still an experimental challenge. As one approach to overcome these shortcomings, various activities have been initiated in the last few years to establish data bases of aspherical ED fragments obtained either from experimental or theoretical investigations. [15] [16] [17] One concept is to replace the IAM by the invariom formalism, 18 an aspherical scattering model which assigns fixed multipole populations from theoretical calculations (stored in an invariom library 19 ) to each atom of a structure to calculate nonspherical scattering factors. Following the transferability and additivity concept expressed in Bader's Qtaim theory, 20 the data base entries are then applied to the building blocks of a given macromolecule to generate additively the ED of the entire molecule.",

We calculate the Hirshfeld surface according to this condition and map the non-spherical ED on this surface by a colour code. This allows the amount of density at a given site to be visualized.

To meet the two questions raised before (accuracy of the protein structure, choice of the substructure), this quality test was applied to the progesterone receptor as it provides the most complete packing around the substrate molecule. On the one hand, a random generator was used to 'jiggle' the atomic positions. This was done in two steps. First, the amount of displacement in atomic coordinates was chosen to be in the range of the experimental uncertainties of the protein structure. In a second step, the atomic displacements were chosen significantly beyond the experimental errors. On the other hand, the substructure was reduced to half of its size, carrying then 20 amino acids in the protein pocket. For the jiggled structure the multipole populations of the original combined assignment/refinement were applied. For the new smaller substructure, the above presented procedure ( Fig. 1 ) was followed from its second step, which means, a DFT single point calculation was performed, followed by a calculation of theoretical structure factors and subsequent assignment/refinement of multipoles. For these modifications of the progesterone receptor substructures, reactive surfaces were generated and the topology of the intermolecular interactions was derived for the smaller substructure. The results are described in Section 3.4. and in parts in the Supplementary data.",

For the replication of this virus, its main cysteine protease M pro (molecular mass 33.8 kDa per protomer) is essential since it releases the key proteins in viral replication. As a therapeutic approach towards anti-SARS drugs, the inhibition of M pro by aziridine or epoxides was considered. The mechanism is displayed schematically in Figure 6 . A nucleophilic attack from the cysteinic sulphur of M pro takes place at a carbon atom of the epoxide inhibitor. This causes a ring opening and a covalent bond is formed between the cystein S c and the attacked epoxide carbon atom, so that an irreversible inhibition of M pro results. For the application of the procedure described above to the M pro inhibition procedure, we have made use of two corresponding macromolecular structures reported by Lee et al. 39 One is the unbound M pro structure (PDB code 2A5A, resolution 2.08 \u00c5), the second one is a complex of M pro with an azapeptide epoxide (APE) substrate (R 1 = Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln, R 2 = COOEt, (3), see Fig. 6 ), PDB code 2A5I (resolution 1.88 \u00c5). After extraction of the active site subfragment (41 residues) we have obtained ESP's in these regions, which are shown in Figure 7 (top left) for the case of the unbound protein and in Figure 7 (top right) for the active site of the complex where the interaction with the substrate is taken into account. In addition, Figure 7 (bottom left and right) shows the ESP of the substrate before and after ring opening has taken place. While in the unbound active site pocket a more or less balanced distribution of positive and negative ESP sites is seen, the interior of the pocket is dominated by negative ESP in case of the complex which is in accordance with the mostly positive ESP surface of the substrate. Figure 8 shows the Hirshfeld surface of the APE substrate with the electron density mapped as colour code on this surface. As mentioned before, deeply coloured regions show high electron density concentrations being generally indicative for strong intra or intermolecular interactions. We note that the strongest ED is found just at the site where the covalent bond with the S c has been established.",

Recent evidence also supports a role for progesterone in modulation of bone mass. Progesterone effects are mediated by its nuclear receptor, which is a dimer composed of two receptor progesterone binding proteins, PR A and PR B. [40] [41] [42] The crystal structure of a progesterone-bound ligand-binding domain of the human progesterone receptor was published at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution (PDB code 1A28) by Williams and Sigler. 43 The interactions of the hormone with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) were discussed in details based on steric considerations.

Considering the fact that in a first step the mutual recognition takes place via the surfaces of the involved molecules, we have developed a procedure to generate and display molecular surfaces and selected ED surface properties of biomolecules. The present limitations to obtain ED information for macromolecules are diminished by reducing the macromolecular protein structure to a region around the active site, so that the computational effort becomes affordable. The use of two data bases is needed. Experimental X-ray structural information is provided by the protein data base (PDB), while atomic electron density data are supplied by the Invariom data base which allows then the additive generation of the ED of the entire system following Bader's transferability and additivity concept. 20 The procedure is easy to apply with the presently existing software and provides surface properties that allow the identification of sites and strengths of intermolecular interactions. This was shown for the ESP surfaces in protein active site pockets and corresponding substrates and on Hirshfeld surfaces, on which interactions directly become visible in terms of ED concentrations.",

If, for example, docking or fitting techniques for substrate-target systems are carried out based on steric considerations, the obtained geometry can then be entered into the procedure described here to examine also the electronic complementarity. In addition to the possibilities to determine drug-receptor interactions, also potential sites at the receptor can be identified which can preferably be attacked by drugs. These findings can be helpful for the design of chemical structures as new agonists/antagonists on a specific receptor.",

However, the considered examples have shown that even the quantitative analysis of hydrogen bonding in the chosen substructure systems follows the progression developed by Espinosa et al. 47 on the basis of accurate small molecule crystal structures. Furthermore, the analysis of the additional model systems introduced for the progesterone receptor active site (see Section 3.4), the jiggled structure on the one hand and the smaller pocket on the other hand, reveal that the results presented in this study are stable to a high degree. The ESP is virtually identical for the original and the jiggle 0.05 \u00c5 pockets and only slightly different for the smaller 20 residue model. The latter one also shows minor changes in the Hirshfeld surface as well as in the topology of the hydrogen bonds (see Supplementary data). So we are confident that as long as fine details of the atomic structure are not considered, the surface properties are robust enough to provide reliable hints for the recognition and interaction of biomolecular species.",
