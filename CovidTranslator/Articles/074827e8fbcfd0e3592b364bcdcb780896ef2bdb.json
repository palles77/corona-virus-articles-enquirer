Three clones (174, 160, PG78), selected in the cDNA library, including a large portion of the nucleocapsid (N), matrix (M) and peplomeric (S) protein genes, were used as probes for a slot blot hybridization assay. Two probe labelling techniques were compared, radiolabelling with 32p and enzymatic labelling through covalent linkage to peroxidase and chemiluminescence detection. The radioactive probe 174 detected as little as 1 to 3 pg of viral RNA, while the less sensitive enzymatic probe could not reveal more than 100 pg of RNA. No significant detection amplification was achieved when a mixture of the three probes was used. Probe 174 allowed specific identification for BECV. No hybridization was noticed either with rotaviruses or even with other antigenically unrelated members of the family Coronaviridae such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus. The test proved valid for detection of BECV in the supernatant of infected HRT-18 cells: genomic RNA could be detected after direct spotting of samples, but prior nucleic acid extraction after proteinase K treatment improved virus detection. BECV diagnosis in faecal samples using enzymatic probe was compared with conventional diagnostic methods.",

            "text": "A major problem regarding coronavirus infections is the tack of suitable diagnostic techniques for a specific and rapid identification of the virus in biological samples. Among the methods used for routine diagnosis, electron microscopy (EM) of faecal samples [4] is time-consuming. It has also often proved difficult to differenciate pleiomorphic coronavirus particles from the fringed bodies normally found in faeces. Immunofluorescent staining of intestinal sections can only be used for post mortem diagnosis [14] . Alternative methods using the haemagglutinating activity of BECV, such as haemadsorption-elution-haemagglutination assay (HEHA) or haemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI), lack specificity and sensitivity [22, 23, 27] . Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been developed for the detection of BECV in faeces. The first of them employed polyclonal sera with low specificity [20] . Better results were obtained with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies coated on microplates for antigen capture [5, 7] , but very little information on this has been made available yet. Recently, radioactive cDNA probes have been reported to be sensitive and specific for the detection of the Mebus strain of BECV by molecular hybridization [25, 29, 30] . This paper describes investigations for the development of a highly specific and sensitive slot blot hybridization assay to detect the F15 strain of BECV by means of radioactive and enzymatic cDNA probes. The enzymatic probe, labelled through covalent linkage to peroxidase using the \"enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) gene detection system\", was chosen because of its longterm stability and also of its sensitivity reputed to be practically as great as that of a radioactive probe. The ultimate aim was to use the enzymatic probe for routine epidemiological investigation. An attempt has been made to determine the optimal conditions for virus detection in biological samples.",

Preliminary assays conducted by applying genomic R N A samples to nitrocellulose filters by manual dot blot had previously indicated that the radioactive probe detects viral RNA at a concentration of 11 ng (data not shown). It appears therefore that if a slot blotting apparatus is employed, whereby samples can be concentrated on a small slot membrane area, the sensitivity increases significantly and the detection limit is lowered about 5 x 103 times. With the enzymatic probe 174 (Fig. 2 II, column A), less sensitive than the radioactive one, detection is limited at 100 pg of genomic RNA, i.e., 109 genomes. The result is obtained on hyperfilm-ECL after a very short exposure time (1 to 2 min). If exposure time is increased to 5 to 10 min (or more), the sensitivity of the hybridization assay is not improved and some background noise appears which may confuse results (data not shown).",

On examination, the following points seem worth mentioning. (/) The sensitivity of the hybridization test using enzymatic probe and chemiluminescence detection is sufficient to allow BECV diagnosis in diarrhoeal neonatal calves. (ii) The proteinase K-SDS-phenol method is well adapted to the treatment of faecal samples, the interpretation of results is not hindered by any background signal. (iiO Comparison between the slot blot hybridization test and other diagnostic methods reveals that the best correlation is found a Faecal material was treated with proteinase K-SDS-phenol method as described in Materials and methods. Hybridization was performed at 42\u00b0C for 16h with enzymatic probe 174. Time exposure on Hyperfilm-ECL was 2rain.

The lower correlation observed with E M m a y be due to difficulty to differentiate true coronaviruses f r o m the coronavirus-like particles frequently observed in faeces. Alternatively, as molecular hybridization was performed several days after E M , it is conceivable that the viral R N A should have been degraded by nuclease in faecal specimens and therefore left undetected by the probe.

A possible explanation is the presence of overlapping sequences in inserts 174 and 160, which may foster the reassociation of DNA fragments in solution at the expense of hybridization to the nitrocellulose filter. Such reassociation probably occurs more easily with the radioactive probe, as labelling does not change the DNA configuration, than it does with the DNA probe covalently linked to peroxidase. This may account for the very small signal amplification obtained with the enzymatic probe.",

No detectable binding was observed with the heterologous nucleic acid of rotavirus and non-infected HRT-18 cells. It is expected that the probe 174 which specifically identifies the F 15 strain of BECV will also identify the Mebus strain, as in both BECV strains the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding for M and N proteins display almost 100% homology with only minor changes [6, 24] . The probe 174 does not allow the identification of all the members of the family Coronaviridae, as no detectable binding is observed with TGEV. This can easily be explained by the small percentage of homology (under 50%) existing between these two viruses [1 t, 25] . For the same reasons, similar results could probably be obtained for RNA detection of avian coronavirus IBV with which homology is also small [26] . This observation is to be linked to the fact that these coronaviruses belong to three separate antigenic subgroups and it opens the way for a possible use of the hybridization test to identify coronavirus subgroups.",

With it, it is no longer necessary to prepare RNase-free glassware and buffers, whereas this is compulsory for the particularly delicate extraction of viral RNA. It is true, however, that the extraction of nucleic acids by using the proteinase K-SDS-phenol method greatly increases sensitivity. Some of these nucleic acids get lost in the process, but viral RNA binding is improved when proteins and macromolecules competing with viral RNA on the binding sites of nitrocellulose are eliminated. Moreover this process does not produce any false positives when the enzymatic probe is employed. Although it is more time-consuming, the proteinase K-SDS-phenol method has proved preferable to direct spotting for BECV detection in faecal samples. The latter are loaded with various debris which may stop the wells of the slot blotting apparatus and prevent viral RNA binding.",
