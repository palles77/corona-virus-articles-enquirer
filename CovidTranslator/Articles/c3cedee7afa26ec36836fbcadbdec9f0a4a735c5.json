One of the key routes by which the virus can infect populations of animals is by aerosol transmission. This study explored the relationship between number of infected pigs and the probability of detecting influenza virus RNA in bioaerosols through the course of an acute infection. Bioaerosols were collected using a cyclonic collector in two groups of 7 week-old pigs that were experimentally infected by exposure with a contact infected pig (seeder pig). After contact exposure, individual pig nasal swab samples were collected daily and air samples were collected three times per day for 8 days. All samples were tested for influenza by real-time reverse transcriptase (RRT)-PCR targeting the influenza virus matrix gene.",

The temporal dynamics of influenza virus detection in air samples was in close agreement with the nasal shedding pattern in the infected pigs. First detection of positive bioaerosols happened at 1 day post contact (DPC). Positive bioaerosols were consistently detected between 3 and 6 DPC, a time when most pigs were also shedding virus in nasal secretions. Overall, the odds of detecting a positive air sample increased 2.2 times for every additional nasal swab positive pig in the group. In summary, there was a strong relationship between the number of pigs shedding influenza virus in nasal secretions and the generation of bioaerosols during the course of an acute infection.",

A recent survey in the United States concluded that at least 22% of herds, regardless of farm type (e.g. breeding, nursery or finisher), reported having problems attributed to influenza 1 . Influenza is considered endemic and widespread in many countries and regions around the world (Brown, 2000) . Because influenza has no species barrier and continues to be a significant zoonotic infection (Myers et al., 2007) , understanding how the virus spreads within and between populations is crucial.",

There are reports on the detection of swine pathogens (bacteria and virus) in air samples (Bourgueil et al., 1992; Torremorell et al., 1997; Stark et al., 1998; Hermann et al., 2008; Weesendorp et al., 2008; Dee et al., 2009; Verreault et al., 2010) . In addition, studies conducted in pigs to understand the regional spread of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSv) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae confirmed that viable pathogens could travel between 3.5 and 9.1 km from the presumed source of infection Otake et al., 2010) . However, there is still a gap in our understanding of the dynamics of bioaerosol generation and transmission and what role this route of transmission may play in inter-species transmission. This is particularly important for swine influenza virus where porcine species with a relatively low residual respiratory capacity (compared to larger species), might be weakly susceptible hosts (Alexandersen et al., 2003) , but nevertheless can also be strong pathogenic excretors or can be managed under housing conditions where relatively limited aerosols become significant. Hence their contributions to inter-species transmission can be important.",

Aerosol transmission of influenza viruses is poorly understood but this route may be significant in large pig populations in areas of high pig density (Maes et al., 2000; Poljak et al., 2008) . In addition, understanding the risk of airborne transmission is important since infected pigs may pose a risk to other populations, including humans (Van Reeth, 2007) .

Additionally, our logistic regression model identified a relationship between number of positive pigs and influenza detection in the air. The odds of detecting an influenza positive air sample increased 2.2 times per each additional nasal secretion positive pig. This suggests that the risk of aerosolization, and perhaps aerosol transmission, increases as the number of acutely infected pigs increase. More studies are needed to determine whether this relationship is maintained in endemically infected influenza pig populations but it has been described for other viral diseases (Alexandersen et al., 2003; Dee et al., 2009; Pitkin et al., 2009; Verreault et al., 2010) .",

Similar sensitivity has been reported for the detection of other viruses via the cyclonic collector (Pitkin et al., 2009 ). Additionally, cell culture titration of air samples from the experimentally generated aerosols also proved that the device may be a good candidate for collecting viable viral particles. However, in this study influenza virus was not isolated from air samples originating from experimentally infected pigs. Although influenza virus isolation from air samples was not possible here, other studies have demonstrated that the cyclonic collector is capable of recovering viable pathogens including influenza virus (Corzo et al., 2012) , PRRSv and M. hyopneumoniae ).",

Further studies are needed to determine the relationship between detecting the virus in the air and the risk of influenza transmission under field conditions. Understanding the significance of detecting influenza virus in aerosols is crucial to assess the risk of influenza transmission pigs and the risk of transmission from pigs to other species including people.
