This had led to the calling of a national emergency on March 13 th in the United States. Many hospitals, healthcare networks, and specifically Departments of Surgery are asking the same questions of how to cope and plan for surge capacity, personnel attrition, novel infrastructure utilization, and resource exhaustion. Herein, we present a tiered plan for surgical department planning based on incident command levels. This includes Acute Care Surgeon deployment (given their critical care training and vertically integrated position in the hospital), recommended infrastructure and transfer utilization, triage principles, and faculty, resident and advanced care practitioner deployment.",

The clinical syndrome from the virus, now termed COVID-19, can consist of mild respiratory symptoms and fever, to ARDS and death in severe cases. This has led to the disease being officially classified as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and The Unites States Declared a State of Emergency on March 13, 2020. 1 At the time of this writing (March 19 th ), there are over 220,000 confirmed cases worldwide, 9,415 cases in the US with 150 deaths. 2 Many countries states and cities have instituted school, gathering, restaurant, and travel bans to mitigate its spread. Patients at older age and with medical comorbidities are at the most risk of requiring hospitalization, ICU care, and at risk for death. In one of the largest epidemiologic studies to date from China with widescale testing, 81% of all infected may have mild symptoms (fever, cough, malaise), 19% required hospitalization, and 5% required critical care; with an overall case-mortality rate of 2.3%. However, age \u226580 years was associated with a 14.9% case-fatality rate, 8% in 70-79 decade, and 49.0% in critically ill patients. 3 As surgeons watching this even unfold in the US, we urge everyone to be prepared and to create a surgical department action plan in conjunction with key stakeholders and content experts vital to institutional response such as: Emergency Medicine, Anesthesia, Pulmonary Critical Care, Infectious Disease, Internal Medicine, facility and nursing management, and ultimately coordinated under the Incident Command System. 4 Implementing screening by symptoms and exposure risk and mitigating healthcare personnel exposure to COVID-19 patients who require surgery is a key first step. Experience out of China 5 and Singapore 6 have demonstrated that screening by symptoms and routine testing, use of appropriate personal protective equipment Ross et al. Tiered Surgical Response to COVID-19 March 19, 2020 4 (PPE), as well as a coordinated plan involving all aspects of peri-operative care is essential.",

These types of discussions are usually reserved for organ allocation and in cases that require ECMO. Even in a normal situation where your hospital only has one ICU bed, one ventilator, or one ECMO circuit left, the default is to still give it to the first patient that needs that resource. However, more complex in our current Pandemic scenario, is that the ventilator you are allocating today to the person with a poor chance of survival may deprive that resource tomorrow to the patient with a moderate chance of survival. Several schemas have been created in the past to rationalize the choices that are now in front of many healthcare providers, some of which are to maximize number of life years (favors the young), social value (favors occupations that are deemed valuable in preserving society infrastructure and culture), and instrumental value (those that would have impact on the current outbreak like physicians and nurses). 16 Currently in Italy, reports in over capacity facilities describe making hard decisions to not intubate patients over 65, and no ICU care to patients over 80. 17 This type of rationing is unthinkable to most Americans with the perception that all aspects of healthcare are an inherent right up to and escalating towards death. While many practitioners in the US will rightly not want to set hard limits like this, the withholding of surgery with recognition of futility is readily decided upon. Surgeons inherently understand futility in end-stage cancer, overwhelming sepsis, and advanced age and comorbidities. COVID-19 patients, with progression to ARDS and multiple risk factors, will have similarly dismal potential for survival. Therefore, in the vein of justice and maximizing benefit to all of society, advanced triage criteria based on individual risk factors should be performed before resources become exhausted to ensure that the next salvageable patient has the opportunity to benefit where the current patient likely will not.",

If a patient was determined not to need a virtual or physical visit, a telephone call was used to discuss the appointment and manage patient expectations. This tool evaluated not only if they had medical issues requiring evaluation, but also screened for potential COVID infections, utilizing the institutional infectious disease risk screening questions, embedded within the screening tool (eDocument 2). Utilizing this risk tool allowed a patient that was high risk to be directed to a COVID-19 testing site. All patients designated for upcoming clinics are assessed the week prior to the clinic appointment and determined to: 1. Not need to be seen physically nor virtually and their situation is evaluated by a clinic nurse phone conversation. 2. Be an ideal candidate for a virtual clinic visit or 3. In need of objective data, such as a radiograph or laboratory blood work prior to clinic so the type of clinic visit can be determined. Due to the limited socio-economic resource of most of our patients, many of our patients only have access to Android or Apple smart telephones, if any, so a computer video platform is not always viable.",

After reviewing the previously completed screening tool on a patient, an ACS physician or APP perform the virtual visit utilizing a standard virtual exam template (eDocument 3).

On arrival to the clinic if a patient has any active symptoms of a COVID-19 infection, they are directed to a testing site appropriate for their symptoms per institution protocols. Only 1 nurse and 1 attending can evaluate the patient. Utilizing these methods, in the first week of implementation, out of 21 scheduled ACS clinic patients, we have already identified 19 patients able to be managed by virtual or telephone visits (91% reduction in clinic visit exposure). Contact has been completed and they are being managed virtually revealing a potential 91% reduction in clinic visits. Objective data is being obtained for 2 patients (chest radiographs and laboratory values) in order to determine whether they will require a physical clinic visit.

The goal is to allow social distancing while protecting our patients from potential issues that could require hospital admission.1. Designated acute care surgery (ACS) attending and advanced practice provider (APP) will review both the upcoming trauma and emergency general surgery (EGS) clinic appointments and review patient on electronic medical record (EMR). In addition, the Attending will handle requests phoned into the nurse line that may be able to prevent a clinic visit. 2. Patients not needing follow up will be notified by nurse staff. 3. Patients deemed appropriate for virtual visit will be listed for virtual visit screening by nursing staff. (See Virtual visit screening tool) a. If patient has virtual access, then appointment scheduled b. ACS attending or APP will call patient using technology device deemed appropriate from screening tool i. All x-rays and labs will be determined prior to call and patient to get labs and xrays performed at closest AH site. ii. Medications and supplies and therapies will be ordered as outpatient and an EMR note will be completed. 4. If patient deemed a physical appointment presence is needed (either from screening or from virtual appointment): i. The patient and ONLY one family member are allowed to attend clinic appointment ii. COVID-19 screening will be done at triage front desk. If screening is positive, they will be asked to get testing for COVID-19. iii. If still need to be seen that day due to emergency, a mask will be worn by family member and patient and a dedicated room will be used. iv. Only 1 nurse and 1 physician/APP will examine patient using appropriate PPE and N95 mask v. After completion, PPE will be discarded in red-bag and room wiped down per AH protocol 5. If patient calls into clinic number with a problem, they will be screened by nurse and referred to dedicated ACS clinic attending to be handled immediately via virtual device or phone call to prevent need for physical appointment.Notes: 1. If a patient or family member is suspected of having COVID-19 they are sent for testing 2. This is a dynamic process and process may change. The goal is to protect patients and staff by allowing safe social distancing while identifying complex issues early so they may be handled 3. We will attempt to use virtual visit capture via \"whatsapp\" or SKYPE IF patients have access.If not, we will use dedicated I-phone or Samsung video or pictures to evaluate patient and their wounds or concerns. 4. If a patient has staples or sutures, ask them to use the primary care physician. If not available, they can attend clinic appointment and be screened for COVID-19 infections. 5. If physical patient presence necessary, all trauma and EGS patients will be seen 6. All medications, dressing materials, and ostomy supplies will attempt to be handled as a virtual visit and home health scheduled appointments Have patient point to areas of pain and have them describe the pain: site, type, and level Ask patient to show anything else that they feel is important for your assessment Have patient palpate the area of concern and document ability to do so Evaluate any incision sites, redness, swelling, drainage and document Evaluate time frame of staples or stitches and document appearance and when they should be removed Evaluate drains and document amounts and appearances Assessment: Reconfirm with patient the reasons for \"distancing\" and supportive therapies as needed Reiterate with patient the limitations that clinic has using a virtual visit Discuss with patient any issues determined based on virtual exam Discuss any labs or radiographs or consultations needed Recommend any emergency evaluations if issues are noted Discuss with patient timing of staples, stitches, or drain removal Discuss with patient the plan, management, and any prescriptions needed Discuss with patient and/or caregiver timing of next visit",
