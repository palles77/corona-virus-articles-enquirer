            "text": "The sensitivity and specificity of various severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) PCR primer and probe sets were evaluated through the use of commercial kits and in-house amplification formats. Conventional and real-time PCR assays were performed using a heat-block thermocycler ABI 9600, the Roche LightCyclerk version 1.2, or the ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System. The sensitivity of all primers was between 0.0004 and 0.04 PFU with viral cell lysate and between 0.004 and 0.4 PFU in spiked stool specimen per PCR assay. The primer sets for real-time PCR assays were at one least 1 log more sensitive than the primer sets used in the conventional PCR. A panel of viruses including swine gastroenteritis virus, bovine coronavirus, avian bronchitis virus (Connecticut strain), avian bronchitis virus (Massachusetts strain), human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza virus (type III), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A were tested by all assays. All real-time PCR assays used probe-based detection, and no cross-reactivity was observed. With conventional PCR, analysis was performed using agarose gel electrophoresis and multiple nonspecific bands were observed. Two commercial extraction methods, magnetic particle capture and silica-based procedure were evaluated and the results were comparable. The former was less laborious with shorter time for completion and can easily be adapted to an automated system such as the MagNa Pure-LC, which can extract nucleic acid from clinical samples and load it into the sample capillaries of the LightCyclerk. As exemplified by this study, the continued refinement and evaluation of PCR procedures will greatly benefit the diagnostic laboratory during an outbreak of SARS. D",

The illness was introduced into Hong Kong in February 2003 and spread across 5 continents over a period of weeks because of international travel. Approximately 8500 people worldwide were diagnosed with probable SARS during the epidemic with over 900 deaths (National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health, 2003) . In Canada, the outbreak of SARS occurred mostly by means of nosocomial transmission in acute care settings. Culture, electron microscopy, serological tests, and RT-PCR were all used during the initial investigation of SARS outbreaks. The etiological agent has been identified as a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003; Guan et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Tsang et al., 2003) . Because of the severity and communicability of the illness, rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods are essential for timely and effective institution of infection control measures to prevent further transmission.",

Using end-point titration analysis, both Artus and Roche kits demonstrated a detection limit at the dilutions of 10 \u00c07 corresponding to 0.0004 PFU per amplification assay ( Fig. 2a and b, A top panels). As for the spiked stool samples, the end point was at 10 \u00c05 dilution PFU (0.04) per assay ( Fig. 2a and b , B top panels). There was approximately a 2-log decrease in sensitivity when the target RNA was extracted from the spiked stool samples by both assays. The internal controls present in both kits were added to each dilution of viral cell lysate spiked with stool for extraction and amplification to monitor the presence of inhibition. The size of the amplicons generated by the internal control primers as well as the target primers were the same. No inhibition was observed with any of the extracts derived from spiked stool samples. These 2 kits also provide sets of known standards that can be incorporated into the runs to quantify the number of RNA copies if required. The detection levels demonstrated by Artus and Roche kits were 0.5-1.5 and 25-30 copies of RNA per reaction, respectively, calculated based on the standards provided by the 2 kits. The bottom panels of Fig. 2a and b are gel analyses of the amplified products generated by the 2 realtime RT-PCR commercial assays. The size of the amplicon from the Artus and Roche kits are 92 and 180 bp, respectively. The amplicon generated by the internal control primers from the Roche kit has the same molecular weight as the target amplicon; therefore, the products could not be differentiated using agarose gel electrophoresis analysis. Multiple amplicon bands were produced from RT-PCR with RNA template extracted from spiked stool samples ( Fig. 2A  and B , B bottom panels) and viral RNA from the specificity panel ( Fig. 2A and B, C top panels). However, no crossreactivity was observed when the real-time curves were analyzed ( Fig. 2A and B, C top panels) because of the specificities of the probes used in both assays. Besides the 2 commercial kits described above, 3 other sets of primers (primer sets 5, 6 and 7) were designed for real-time amplification using the Roche LightCyclerk version 1.2 and the ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System (SDS) instruments. Primer sets 6 and 7 targeted the nucleocapsid gene sequence whereas primer set 5 was specific for the polymerase gene. With viral cell lysate, PCR end-point titration was at 10 \u00c07 for both primer sets 5 and 6 and 10 \u00c06 with primer set 7 (Table 1) . A similar 2-log drop in sensitivity with the above primers was observed when RNA extracted from the spiked stool samples was used with in-house real-time assays. No positive result was seen with non-SARS-CoV RNA from the specificity panel. However, when PCR products were subjected to agarose gels electrophoresis analysis, multiple bands were present, which M 10 -1 10 -2 10 -3 10 -4 10 -5 10 -6 10 -7 10 -8 10 -9 H2O M 10 -1 10 -2 10 -3 10 -4 10 -5 10 -6 10 -7 10 -8 10 - M 10 -1 10 -2 10 -3 10 -4 10 -5 10 -6 10 -7 10 -8 10 -9 H2O M 10 -1 10 -2 10 -3 10 -4 10 -5 10 -6 10 -7 10 -8 10 -9 H2O M 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 H2O a b Fig. 2 indicated that the hybridization probes had differentiated the products from the nonspecific amplicons (data not shown). Because no internal control has been designed to be included in these reactions, the presence of inhibitors causing a failure in the amplification would not be detected. The sensitivities of conventional block PCR assays for dilutions of viral cell lysate and viral cell lysate spiked stool samples with the different sets of primers are shown in Fig. 3 , panels A and B. The detection limit by agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of primer sets 1 and 4 was at 10 \u00c06 (0.004 PFU/PCR) with viral cell lysate and at 10 \u00c04 (0.4 PFU/PCR) With fecal spiked samples. The end-point titrations of viral cell lysate with primers sets 2 and 3 were at 10 \u00c06 and 10 \u00c05 , respectively. There was no change in sensitivity by PCR end-point titration with primer set 2 with fecal spiked viral cell lysate samples. As for primer set 3, there was a 1-log drop in sensitivity with fecal spiked samples, and the PCR end-point detection was at 10 \u00c04 . There was also weakly stained band observed slightly lower than the desired amplicon from 10 \u00c05 to 10 \u00c09 dilutions in Fig. 3 . The band was excised from the gel, and DNA was purified, sequenced, and compared with the SARS-CoV and other coronavirus sequences in GenBank. The sequence data showed no resemblance to the coronavirus genome. If the identification of the presence of virus was mainly based on agarose gel electrophoresis analysis without any further confirmation, this could have been mistaken as a weak-positive, assuming that it was because of a low viral load in the specimen, and thus a falsepositive result would be reported. Primer set 4 was the only exception that amplified one specific product with no other nonspecific products even in the presence of fecal material.",

The commercial kits from Artus and Roche contain internal controls that allow the monitoring of extraction and detection of inhibitory factors. This is extremely important in a diagnostic laboratory because clinical samples may contain inhibitors that might interfere with PCR resulting in amplification failure and the reporting of a false-negative result. PCR inhibition is not the only contributory factor to a false-negative report. The type and quality of the specimen and time of collection during the course of the disease play critical roles. Stool was chosen for the spiking experiments because of its heterogeneity, complexity, and that it is likely to contain the most diverse inhibitory factors; it was also one of the specimen types collected from SARS-CoV patients for diagnosis. Although no inhibition was observed with fecal samples spiked with SARS-CoV, it does not mean that inhibition problems associated with clinical samples have been eliminated by using silica-or magnetic-based types of RNA extraction. In Drosten et al.'s (2004) study, inhibition was seen with one PCR assay but not the other using the same extracted RNA; this might because of the types of enzyme and reagents used in the amplification assay (Wiedbrauk et al., 1995) . There was no available clinical sample in this investigation, but both Artus and Roche kits have improved detection of SARS-CoV, and the sensitivity in stool samples have reached 78-87% (Drosten et al., 2004) versus 58-63% reported earlier .",

By using an external preparation of standards recommended by WHO, Hourfar et al. (2004) found that linear measurement by the Roche assay was between 2 \u00c2 10 4 and 2 \u00c2 10 8 copies of the external standard RNA preparation per milliliter and that the Artus assay has a broader linear range from 1 \u00c2 10 2 to 1 \u00c2 10 7 copies of RNA/mL (Hourfar et al., 2004) . With the wide dynamic range of the Artus assay, even low concentrations of SARS-CoV can be measured quantitatively. Sensitivity calculated based on 95% probability limits was N 40,000 copies/mL for Roche assay and N380 copies/mL for Artus Assay (Hourfar et al., 2004) . The Roche assay is less sensitive as compared with the Artus assay and this might be because of the amplicon size and the enzymes used in these 2 assays. The amplified product of the Artus assay is 92 bp as compared with 180 bp in the Roche assay. A combination of 2 enzymes, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Taq DNA polymerase are used in the Artus assay, whereas the Roche assay applies the 1-enzyme rTth (Thermus thermophilus) DNA polymerase assay in combination with manganese ions for RT-PCR. The enzyme rTth is less susceptible to GC-rich genomes and inhibitors; however, the lack of sensitivity at low concentration of virus is most likely because of insufficient reverse transcriptase activity (Cusi et al., 1994) . Contrary to the observation by Hourfar et al. (2004) , in our study, results of the PCR end-point titration by the 2 kits were identical, and the detection level was at 0.004 PFU/PCR for viral cell lysate and 0.4 PFU/CPR with fecal spiked samples.",

            "text": "The design of the in-house primer sets included in this study was based on both the polymerase and nucleocapsid genes. The sensitivities of all these assays are comparable and confirm an earlier observation by Drosten et al. (2004) indicating the nucleocapsid gene is only in abundance in the early stage of viral infection in cell culture. Therefore, PCR assays with nucleocapsid gene as target would not likely to increase the sensitivity of detection in symptomatic patients. The conventional PCR assays were performed using the heat block format (ABI 9600, Applied BioSystem), and the real-time amplification assays were conducted on the Roche LC version 1.2 and ABI 7000 SDS instruments. Because the primers selected for conventional PCR and real-time PCR were not identical, no direct comparison of sensitivity could be made between the 2 types of assays. However, the primer sets for real-time PCR included in this study seemed to be at one least 1 log more sensitive than the primer sets used in the conventional PCR. According to Emery et al. (2004) , using real-time PCR with their published primers, the potential detection limit is less than 10 transcript copies per PCR and has a greater sensitivity than cell culture isolation and conventional PCR; lesser efficiency of amplification in the presence of clinical specimens was also observed. Our data also showed a drop in the sensitivity by 1-2 orders of magnitude with the addition of fecal material. The sensitivity of the amplification assays has shown improvement by increase in volume of specimen for extraction and real-time PCR coupled with modified extraction method (Poon et al., 2003a (Poon et al., , 2003b . The turnaround time for the conventional PCR required a minimum of 6 h because the cycling time was longer and also required gel analysis for detection. There were multiple nonspecific bands with variable sizes observed in the agarose gels after electrophoresis with some of the primer sets. Using primer set 4, we did not observe other nonspecific PCR bands with RNA extracted from spiked stool samples but this might occur with other clinical specimens submitted for diagnosis. There was insufficient data to show that there would not be any cross-reactivities with other submitted stool samples or any other clinical samples. Without probe hybridization, restriction digestion or sequencing of the amplicon as means of confirmation, there is the potential of reporting a false-positive, which has an important implication especially in an outbreak setting such as a SARS epidemic.",

Both kits performed equally well in the removal of inhibitors and was shown by the successful amplification of the internal control in the PCR assays of the Roche and Artus Assay kits. The completion and hands-on time for extraction is less, and fewer consumables are required for the MagaZorbk kit as compared with the NucliSensR kit. If the basic kit cost is identical for both, the choice of one over the other will depend on expenditures for labor and consumables. We have also found that specimens that were extracted by the MagaZorbk kit could easily be adapted to the MagNa Pure-LC, an automated nucleic acid extractor (Roche Diagnostics). Because this instrument can also dispense the extracted nucleic acid into the sample holders (capillaries) of the Roche LC Version 1.2, the extraction of clinical specimens for SARS can be moved to this automated platform with minimal technical requirement. This is extremely important in outbreak situation when automation and rapid turnaround time are parts of the critical factors for isolation of and treatment of patients.",

Another alternative is to refer an unopened aliquot of specimen to another laboratory that perform SARS-CoV amplification with target primers of equal sensitivity and specificity. For any positive results, it is also recommendable to request for follow up specimens not only for amplification but also for serology and culture. Although much emphasis has been on the utilization of RT-PCR as one of the diagnostic tool for SARS because of its sensitivity, the results obtained should be interpreted with caution because of the possibility of contamination. Therefore, it is important for laboratory personnel conducting these tests to have meticulous technique as well as physical separation for the different steps in the manipulation of clinical specimens.",

Further testing on different clinical specimens is required to confirm our observations of the performance of all these primer sets in their respective PCR assays.
