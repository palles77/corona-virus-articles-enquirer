In this study, we initially compared the protective immune responses elicited following immunization with recombinant Bm-ALT-2 protein regimen and Bm-alt-2 DNA regimen. These studies showed that protein vaccination conferred approximately 75% protection compared to DNA vaccination that conferred only 57% protection. Analysis of the protective immune responses showed that the protein immunization promoted a Th2-biased response with an increase in IL-4, IL-5 and IgG1 responses, whereas, the DNA vaccine promoted a Th1-biased response with profound IFN-\u03b3 and IgG2a responses. Since protein vaccination gave better results than DNA vaccination, we then wanted to evaluate whether a prime-boost vaccination that combined DNA prime and protein boost will significantly increase the protective responses induced by the protein vaccine. Our results suggest that prime-boost vaccination had no added advantage and was comparatively less effective (64% protection) than the Bm-ALT-2 protein alone vaccination. Prime boost vaccination generated mixed Th1/Th2 responses with a slightly diminished Th2 responses compared to protein vaccination. Thus, our results suggest that Bm-ALT-2 protein vaccination regimen may be slightly better than prime-boost vaccine regimen and the mechanism of protection appears to be largely mediated by a Th2-biased response.",

Clinically, disease is classified into distinct stages including microfilaraemic (MF) where individual is asymptomatic but microfilaraemic; chronic pathology (CP), where individual is with clinical evidence of lymphatic obstruction but amicrofilaraemic. In addition, individuals who are asymptomatic amicrofilaraemic and believed to be resistant to disease are designated as endemic normals (EN).",

However, these control methods have limited utility, because of several factors including the development of possible drug and pesticide resistance, high cost of chemotherapy programs and inaccessibility of many years of required drug treatment to infected population of poor regions (Molyneux et al., 2003) . Hence, development of control measures such as vaccination would be best additional strategy to eliminate filariasis. Previous studies showed that vaccination with recombinant paramyosin could offer partial protection to larval challenge (Li et al., 1993) . However, vaccine studies using BmVAL-1 (Murray et al., 2001) , heat shock protein 70, myosin, and \u03b11-type IV collagen (Peralta et al., 1999) did not yield encouraging results. Among all the recombinant vaccine candidates analyzed, ALT (Abundant Larval Transcript) family of proteins appeared to elicit significantly high protective responses against B. malayi (Gnanasekar et al., 2004; Gregory et al., 2000) . The expression of these proteins starts at late L2 stage and peaks at L3 stage. Thus, Bm-ALT-2 protein is abundantly synthesized in the infective stages of the parasite and believed to play a major role in the transmission and infectivity of the filarial parasite (Gregory et al., 2000; Gomez-Escobar et al., 2005) . Interestingly, sera from endemic normal individuals (EN), but not asymptomatic microfilaremic (MF) or chronic lymphatic obstruction/elephantiasis (chronic pathology, CP) patients, have significantly high levels of circulating antibodies against Bm-ALT-2 (Gnanasekar et al., 2004; Ramachandran et al., 2004) . Since EN subjects are considered as putatively immune individuals, several studies were conducted to evaluate the potential of Bm-ALT-2 as a potential vaccine candidate (Gnanasekar et al., 2004; Ramachandran et al., 2004) . These studies showed that immunization of mice or jirds with recombinant Bm-ALT-2 can confer over 70% protection. These findings coupled with the fact that there are no human homologues for Bm-ALT-2 suggests that Bm-ALT-2 may be an ideal candidate for vaccine development against human lymphatic filariasis.",

Heterologous prime-boost vaccination is one of the approaches in which after priming with DNA, a different agent like recombinant virus or protein is used in as a 'boost' dose to obtain enhanced protective efficacy (Ferraz et al., 2004; Santra et al., 2004; Vordermeier et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004) . Several studies show that the strategy of using DNA to prime the immune system and recombinant protein to boost immune responses could lead to better cellular and antibody response in vaccinated animals compared to homologous protein or DNA vaccination regimens (Jones et al., 2001; Letvin et al., 1997; Ruitenberg et al., 2000) . In the present study, we compared the degree of protective immunity conferred by Bm-alt-2 DNA prime-Bm-ALT-2 protein-boost vaccination (prime boost) regimen with DNA prime-DNA boost (DNA vaccine) or protein prime-protein boost (protein vaccine) regimens.",

Total RNA was extracted from cell pellets using Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Following preparation and subsequent washes with ethanol, RNA pellets were dissolved in diethyl-pyrocarbonate (Sigma) treated water. After treatment with DNase I, total RNA was quantified using spectrophotometer at 260 nm, and the quality of RNA was determined by the ratio of optical density at 260 nm to that at 280 nm. Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed using a ProtoScript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as per manufacturer's recommendations.

PCR amplification for 28 cycles was carried out to ensure that the products lie within the linear portion of the curve. PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Gels were scanned to determine band intensity of PCR products.

Bm-alt-2 prime-boost vaccine regimen induced significantly higher titer of antibodies compared to DNA vaccine alone (p < 0.05). Bm-ALT-2 protein vaccine induced the highest level of Bm-ALT-2 specific IgG titer.",

Furthermore, the antibody isotype also offers a good surrogate marker of Th1 and Th2 immune responses (Rizzo et al., 1992) . IgG2a levels correlate with Th1 and IgG1 levels correlate with Th2. Thus, we could also determine the relationship between Th1 and Th2 responses following various immunization regimens by calculating the IgG1/ IgG2a ratio (Fig. 3 ). An increase in the IgG1/IgG2a ratio suggests a Th2-biased response, whereas, a reversed IgG1/IgG2a ratio suggests a Th1-biased response. Animals vaccinated with Bm-ALT-2 protein alone had high IgG1/IgG2a ratio suggesting a Th2-biased response, whereas, animals immunized with Bm-alt-2 DNA alone had a low ratio of IgG1/IgG2a suggesting a Th1-biased response. Interestingly however, prime-boost vaccinated animals had high IgG1/IgG2a ratios comparable to Bm-ALT-2 protein vaccinated animals. These findings suggested that immunization with Bm-ALT-2 protein even as a booster dose increases the IgG1 titers in DNA primed animals pushing the responses to a Th2-biased pathway.",

Use of micropore chambers significantly alleviated the problem of recovering parasites from the peritoneal cavity and allowed us to count the exact number of larval death. Microscopic examination of worms recovered from micropore chambers revealed large numbers of macrophages and polymorph nuclear cells adhered to dead larvae. Numbers of dead and live larvae within the micropore chambers were counted and percent protection was calculated. Our results showed that immunization with Bm-alt-2 DNA alone could induce 57% protection in vaccinated animals (Table 2) . A comparison of the protective efficacy of the Bm-ALT-2 protein vaccine and the prime-boost vaccination regimen showed that Bm-ALT-2 protein vaccination alone was enough to elicit maximum protection levels. Jirds immunized with prime-boost vaccination had less than 40% live larvae, significantly less than that of animals immunized with DNA vaccine alone (57%, p < 0.05). Thus, more than 60% of protection could be achieved by prime-boost vaccination.

This Th2 bias might also be partially due to the alum in the preparation. It is well established that alum adjuvant preferentially stimulates a Th2-mediated immune response (Brewer et al., 1999) . Earlier studies showed that Th2-biased responses are associated with protective immune responses against various nematode parasites (Babu et al., 2000; Le Goff et al., 2000; Martin et al., 2000; Volkmann et al., 2003) . A role for IL-5 (Th2 cytokine) has been suggested in these protective responses. In the present study also, we observed an increase in IL-5 mRNA expression in animals immunized with protein vaccine. No such increases in IL-5 responses were seen in animals immunized with DNA vaccine alone. However, in prime-boost vaccinated animals there was an increase in IL-5 suggesting that this response might be mediated by the protein boost. Previous studies also suggest that IL-5 may be essential for vaccine-mediated protection in filarial infection in mice (Le . Increased expression of IL-5 in protein vaccinated animals suggests that IL-5 mediated responses may also have a role in jirds, a permissive host. DNA vaccination predominantly generated a Th1-biased response as evidenced by the high IgG2a levels, decreased IgG1/IgG2a ratio and high IFN-\u03b3. This response was slightly diminished in the prime-boost vaccination. In fact, the prime-boost vaccinated animals showed a mixed Th1-Th2 response. DNA component in the prime-boost regimen is probably responsible for the Th1 responses. The protein component in prime-boost regimen was responsible for the increased levels of Bm-ALT-2 specific IgG1 serum antibodies. Nevertheless, these responses were not sufficient enough to down regulate the IFN-\u03b3 induced by the DNA vaccine in the prime-boost regimen.",

However, further passive transfer experiments using various isotype of antibodies would be useful in determining the role of each isotype of antibodies, especially IgG1 in the vaccine-induced immunity.",

Analysis of the antibody and cytokine responses suggests that a Th2-biased response may be more important in the protection induced by the Bm-ALT-2 protein. Further studies to enhance the Th2 responses induced by the Bm-ALT-2 protein vaccination with other Th2 driving adjuvants might enhance the protective effect.

Optical density was measured at 405 nm. Antibody titer is defined as reciprocal dilution of the sera yielding a one-half maximal absorbance at 405 nm. Data represent mean titers (in logarithmic scale) and standard errors for each group of animals. Ratio of IgG1 titer to IgG2a titer in different groups. The ratio of IgG1/IgG2a was obtained by dividing the titer of IgG1 by that of IgG2a. Data presented are means (in boxes) and SD values. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to Bm-ALT-2. Spleen cells were collected from immunized animals and stimulated with Bm-ALT-2. Data shown are means \u00b1 standard deviations of stimulation index. Cytokine mRNA levels. Spleen cells were stimulated with 10 \u03bcg/ml of Bm-ALT-2 protein for 72 h. Cytokine mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. The actual densitometric values for each cytokine mRNA were normalized by using \u03b2-actin densitometry as the 100% reference, and all other values are expressed as percentages of \u03b2-actin. ",
