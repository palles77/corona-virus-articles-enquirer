Several small outbreaks in Micronesia and the Pacific Islands have been reported since then, and then ZVI started revealing its epidemic potential [3] . In 2015, the virus was associated with neurological disorders, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, microcephaly and still unknown abnormalities in newborns infants [4, 5] . It was and yet remains an event surrounded by many scientific uncertainties. In February 2016, mostly driven by the large numbers of Zika-associated microcephaly cases in Brazil, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Different research groups all over the world, as part of separate and collaborative research networks, made a concerted effort to understand the various factors required to cope with the epidemic of Zika virus infection, transmission, pathogenesis, treatment and control, as well as the social impact of severe forms of the disease [3] . During the outbreak, especially after WHO PHEIC, international funding and fast-tracking procedures for publishing scientific outcomes stimulated scientific research and publications. The fast increase in the number of basic researches on Zika from 2015 to May of 2016 has been attributed mainly to its association with microcephaly [6] . However, from then on, only a few core journals have published on Zika [7] .",

Some studies have adopted bibliometric or scientometric perspectives, analysing papers and other documents to discuss aspects such as co-authorship, cooperative networks and the innovative potential of the ZVI topic [7] [8] [9] [10] . In Maia et al [11] , a first study on the scientific networks organized around ZVI and their most influential researchers used Social Network Analysis to map the co-authorship networks of Zika papers published in 2015/2016. The study showed that, besides the number of publications, the prominence of a given researcher in scientific networks can be explained by the diversity of partnerships and the establishment of connections with the pioneers in the field [11] . Also, a recent study on Zika-related publications and patents from a scientometric perspective highlighted the strategic role played by the Latin America and Caribbean research network in terms of addressing the science and technology (S&T) challenges related to the outbreak [12] . The debate raised by such scientometrics studies applied to Zika enriches the discussion about the influence and centrality of certain groups, researchers and even countries.",

Overall, WoS provides a complete information for each article. For instance, information about authors' institutional affiliation country is not fully present in PubMed. Moreover, WoS provides summarized subject categories, and although Scopus also presents subject categories, they are not aligned with those of WoS. From that on, using only the WoS database, we performed two separate analyses, which we describe below: a descriptive analysis to understand how countries collaborate towards Zika knowledge; and, a textual analysis of research on Zika using knowledge mapping over time and space (i.e., countries). In order to summarize the findings in this manuscript, we present our results for the top ten countries with the most publications.",

The baseline assessment of research areas into clusters relied on the clustering algorithm of IRAMuTeQ v7.2 (Interface for Multidimensional Analysis of Texts and Questionnaires). The association process is obtained by testing if the frequency of a given word is statistically associated with another using Pearson Chi-square at a significance level of 5%.

To associate WoS categories with the abstract clusters defined by IRAMuTeQ, we first selected the ten most frequent categories (that is given by WoS) presented in our studied articles. Second, we analysed if the most significant categories for each one of the 6 clusters independently appeared with a high frequency or not. By doing this, we were able to better classify the clusters by the words which appeared in each one of them. Moreover, we used the categories defined by WoS for each article, based on the journal in which it was published to further evaluate if the clustering process and defined sub-areas of research were aligned.

Anther six categories, among the 10% most frequent, were not included in the top ten list, but were significant to categorize the clusters, these were: Entomology; Cell Biology; Health Policy and Services; Clinical Neurology; Pediatrics; and Diagnosis. Based on these sixteen categories, we associated WoS categories with the abstract clusters defined by IRAMuTeQ. We found the following results for Group A: Public Environmental Occupational Health category in the \"Epidemiology\" cluster (cluster 3); Parasitology category in \"Entomology\" (cluster 4); and Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine in both \"Diagnosis\" (cluster 2) and \"Entomology\" clusters. Considering that Diagnosis, Epidemiology and Entomology categories from WoS were in cluster 2, 3 and 4, respectively, each cluster was named after these categories. Cluster 1, \"Clinical Aspects\", had none of the top 10 high-frequency categories of WoS in it.",

The International Collaboration Index (ICI) and the International Collaboration Factor (ICF) helped us to gain insight into collaborations between countries, and to identify which countries have collaborated more extensively over time.

Among the possible reasons why the USA is such a prominent publication country and a central player in terms of international collaboration in Zika could be the fact that it is the top R&D funder for neglected diseases [20] and that several cases of Zika virus transmission were reported in 2016-17 in Florida and Texas [21] .

We believe that the position of Brazil is due to the country's role as the epicenter of the most recent ZVI epidemic, which boosted foreign scientific interest and made it a key partner in scientific publications focused on this topic. Also, the potential threat of a Zika epidemic could partially explain the increased country collaboration over time. When the first case of Zika virus infection was confirmed in the Northeast region of Brazil, in May 2015, an epidemiological alert by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO was released. The alert recommended Member States to establish and maintain a capacity for ZVI detection, clinical management and an effective public communication strategy [24] . In November 2015, Brazil declared ZVI a national public health emergency and three months later, the WHO declared it a PHEIC [25] . We suggest that a causal effect between the alert/emergency and the increased number of collaborations took place during this period considering the knowledge gaps in understanding ZVI. Brazil is a country with a vast scientific literature on dengue virus transmission, among other arboviruses. However, the results indicate that it had carried out almost no research on Zika virus before the start of the epidemic.",

This scenario gives an academic advantage to countries with a higher technological density.
