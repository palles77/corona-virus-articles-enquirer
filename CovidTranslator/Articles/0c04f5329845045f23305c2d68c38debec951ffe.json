In addition, the use of chromogenic substrates for the enzyme labels permits visual interpretation of test results in some cases. The only real disadvantages of EIA tests are the loss of antibody reactivity that may result from conjugation to enzymes, and the limits of substrate detection. For example, use of enzymes that have molecular weights higher than that of IgG molecules such as P-D-galactosidase (MW 540,000 Da) can cause steric hindrance of antibody activity (Herrmann and Morse, 1974) . With regard to limits of substrate detection, improvement of enzyme detection by use of fluorogenic, luminescent, or radioactive substrates (reviewed by Yolken, 1982) has been proposed.",

In situations where a given antigen does not readily attach, antibody to the antigen is applied first. For some antigens, nonspecific adsorbents such as poly-L-lysine have been used to enhance antigen adsorption, or the Clq component of complement to capture antigen-antibody complexes (Yolken, 1982) . Most of the assays described are of the noncompetitive type, although a number of competitive assays have been described. The disadvantage of many competitive assays for antigen detection is that they use labeled antigen, which is usually more difficult to prepare than labeled antibody. With the advent of monoclonal antibodies, competitive assays for specific antibodies are becoming more common. A number of different formats of EIA tests for antigens and antibodies are possible. These are discussed in Section II,C and D.",

Homogeneous assays are based on the reaction of antigen with an antibody-enzyme complex. This results in steric hindrance of the enzyme, which causes a decrease in product after reaction with enzyme substrate. The major advantage of homogeneous assays is that they do not require the separation and washing steps required in heterogeneous assays. The major disadvantage of this type of EIA is that it has been difficult to apply it to detection of high-molecularweight antigens with the degree of sensitivity required. Thus, the homogeneous assay has been used mainly for detection of hormones, drugs, and other low-molecular-weight substances. Means to improve the sensitivity of homogeneous assays have been devised (review by Yolken, 1982) but have not been widely used. Thus, the applications discussed below will be limited to EIA tests of the solid-phase type.",

The amount of immunoglobulin that can be immobilized on various plastics is given in Table I11 (Herrmann, 1981) . Increasing the amount of antibody bound to a solid-phase surface should result in increased sensitivity of the EIA. However, it has been noted that increasing the concentration of antibody for coating surfaces beyond 10 kg/ml does not give an increase in immunoassay sensitivity. This is apparently due to desorption of antibody from the plastic surface, and steric hindrance of antibody that is adsorbed. Solid-phase surfaces other than plastic tubes, beads, or particles, such as porous glass (Lynn, 1975) have been used to immobilize antibody. However, the majority of EIA tests for microbial infections use either plastic plates or beads. A more recent development mentioned above that may be applicable to a variety of microbial antigens and antibodies is the use of nitrocellulose membrane disks as a solid phase. This was successfully developed as a visual readout method for detecting adenovirus antigens and antibodies (Bode et al., 1984).",

The diluents used for antigen preparation can also alter the sensitivity. Disrupting microbial agents with detergents or other chemicals may increase the sensitivity of some assays but decrease others (Yolken, 1982) . A number of diluents not usually used in EIA tests was tested by Conroy and Esen (1984) for adsorbing a plant protein to polystyrene. These included detergents, acids, alcohols, and urea. Use of alcohols or urea in-creased the EIA substantially. Whether this would be applicable to microbial antigens remains to be tested.",

In a review by Hill and Matsen (1983) a sensitivity greater than 95% was reported for some assays, hut the sensitivity was as low as 50% in many others. Thus, each test must be carefully examined to determine how useful it is for a specific infection. In addition to problems with low sensitivity, the major drawback to many assays is the lack of standardization. Without the availability of standard serum samples for evaluation of assays, new assays require testing by a number of investigators before their validity can be assessed. In many instances, however, serological diagnosis is the only means available to many laboratories for diagnosing some of the more exotic diseases. For example, for diagnosis of Lyme disease, culture ofthe causative spirochete is possible, but is often ineffective. Use of an EIA test for specific IgM and IgG response in patients with proven Lyine disease was diagnostic in 11 of 12, and the EIA gave no false positive results in 40 control subjects (Craft et aE., 1984) . Early recognition of disease is another area where EIA tests for specific IgM and IgG may be the best or only method available to some, such as diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (Hernandez et al., 1984) , although new- Dittmar et al.

Premarket evaluation of this test on 416 patients showed the EIA had a sensitivity of 83% (63176) and a specificity of 94% (Jones et d., 1984) . In a larger study involving 2384 specimens the EIA had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 94% . Mycoplasma hominis may also be involved in sexually transmitted disease, and diagnosis by culture requires expertise. An antigen EIA has been developed (Miettinen et al., 1984) and was positive for six specimens positive by culture. More extensive evaluation is required to determine the utility of the assay as a screening procedure. Detection by EIA of bacterial antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and respiratory tract secretions has also been attempted, with good results for some antigens. Yolken et al. (1984) reported 100% sensitivity for detecting pneumococcal antigen in 25 CSF specimens, but others have found difficulty in differentiating pneumococcal antigens from meningococcal antigens in CSF by EIA . Use of monoclonal antibody for detecting group A meningococcal antigens has been described (Sugasawara et al., 1984) but was 84% as sensitive as polyclonal serum for detecting antigen in the same CSF samples. Detection of Haemophilous influenzae B by EIA has been shown to be effective in limited clinical trials. Drow et al. (1979) developed an EIA which was 100% sensitive on 11 positive CSF samples, , using a similar EIA system, detected 17 of 20 samples that were positive for Haemophilus by counterimmunoelectrophoresis or coagulation. There were 17 positive by culture. Antigen detection by EIA for respiratory infections has been described for Legionella pneumophila, tuberculosis, and streptococcus group A infection. The most extensive study for detecting L. pneumophila antigens in urine was done by Sathapatayavongs et al. (1982) , who obtained a 82.9% (39/47) sensitivity and a specificity of 100% in 178 urines from patients with other diseases. An inhibition EIA for detection of streptococcus group A antigen is throat swabs was also effective, giving a sensitivity of 97.0% and a specificity of 97.9% (Knigge et al., 1984) . Confirmed diagnosis of tuberculosis is difficult because of the long period required to culture the causative organism. Preliminary results of an EIA developed by Sada et al. (1983) , utilizing rabbit antibody to BCG, showed a sensitivity of 81.2% in 16 samples from patients with tuberculosis meningitis. Because antibodies to BGG may cross react with other mycobacteria, as well as with species of Nocardia and Corynebacterium, the test needs further evaluation for specificity.",

Sensitivity could also be increased by increasing the amount of detector antibody used in an EIA. However, because monoclonal antibodies react with only one epitope of a given antigen, more than one monoclonal antibody may be needed to achieve the desired sensitivity. In practice, monoclonal antibodies have been used successfully in latex agglutination tests and also in immunofluorescence techniques (Nowinkski et al., 1983) . Their use in EIA has been limited to date, but the number described for microbial antigens to date suggest that applications in clinical diagnosis will be increasing. The EIA tests that have been developed look promising. For EIA detection of adenovirus group antigens in stools, monoclonal antibodies were as sensitive as polyclonal ones, and were more sensitive for detecting noncultivatable adenoviruses (presumably enteric serotypes). All 12 stool samples positive by EM were monoclonal EIA positive (Anderson et al., 1983) .",

For detection of antibodies, the major problems are standardization of reagents and EIA methodology. This should improve when more reagents become commercially available, and when a standard method is selected from the variety of procedures now available. For detection of antigen, which offers a rapid and direct means of diagnosing microbial infections, the major problems has been lack of sensitivity. Increasing the sensitivity of polyclonal EIA tests by using more concentrated immunoreagents or more sensitive enzyme substrates has often resulted in a loss of specificity. From the reports available to date, it appears that use of the appropriate monoclonal antibodies may solve the problem of sensitivity for detecting many infectious agents in clinical samples. With the increasing number of monoclonal antibodies available for varius microbial antigens, we can expect that more of them will be utilized for EIA detection systems. If the affinities of monoclonal antibodies can be increased, the EIA tests may be sufficiently sensitive.",
