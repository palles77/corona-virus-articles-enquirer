            "text": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic viral disease with a disease fatality rate between 15% and 70%. Despite the wide range of distribution, the virus (CCHFV) is basically endemic in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Acute febrile illness associated with petechiae, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure are the main symptoms of the disease. With all these fatal effects, CCHFV is considered a huge threat as no successful therapeutic approach is currently available for the treatment of this disease. In the present study, we have used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV. Both the T-cell and B-cell epitopes were assessed, and the epitope \"DCSSTPPDR\" was found to be the most potential one, with 100% conservancy among all the strains of CCHFV. The epitope was also found to interact with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered nonallergenic as well. In vivo study of our proposed peptide is advised for novel universal vaccine production, which might be an effective path to prevent CCHF disease.",

            "text": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the causative agent of the hemorrhagic fever, which was first described in Cremia in 1945. 1 The virus consists of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA, and its tripartite genome comprises the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments, which encode the viral nucleocapsid (N), glycoprotein precursor, and polymerase-L proteins, respectively. 2 Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East are the hotspots of this viral infection, with a high fatality rate between 15% and 70%. 3, 4 In case of human infection, the progression of this disease is very rapid and it causes acute febrile illness, associated with petechiae, ecchymosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure. 5 A wide range of ticks that belong to the Hyalomma genus are considered the main vectors of this viral disease and the disease is spread through the bite of these ticks to humans or other domestic animals. 6 Due to inadequate hospital care, the disease is also spread nosocomially and a case reported that, in South Africa, about 33% medical personnel are infected through needlestick injury. 7 Alternate routes of infection, such as aerosol and droplet respiratory route of infection, were also suspected for several cases in Russia. 8 With a broad geographic distribution, Oany et al this virus already covers .30 countries across Africa, southeastern Europe, the Middle East, western Asia, and more recently, some places of southwestern Europe, particularly Spain. [9] [10] [11] The wide distribution of this virus indicates the ability of the tick hosts to adapt across different environmental and geographic regions. 12 Despite the outbreaks, there is no reliable vaccine or drug for the treatment of CCHFV infection in animals or humans. 13 As a single-stranded-RNA-containing genome and due to the error-prone nature of its polymerase, the CCHFV incorporates random mutations into the genome. The rate of recombination in its RNA is also very high. As a consequence, the development of a vaccine or antiviral drug against CCHFV is very difficult. 14 The design of epitope-based vaccines against some deadly viruses has gained much popularity due to its increased potency and safety. 15, 16 The application of bioinformatics in immunology, which is also termed immunoinformatics, is now widely accepted. Immunoinformatics can assist in designing new vaccines through the identification of potential T-cell epitope, B-cell epitope, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands. [17] [18] [19] This novel approach has proven its efficacy in the case of multiple sclerosis, 20 malaria, 21 human immunodeficiency virus, 22 and tuberculosis, 23 with desired results. In our present study, we have proposed the design of a potential conserved epitope candidate through the immunoinformatics approaches in order to minimize the fatal effects of the CCHFV, with the expectation of finding a novel candidate for the vaccine via wet laboratory validation.",

The ability of an epitope-based vaccine to stimulate an effective specific immune response with a minute structure and without any unexpected side effects has made it a good choice for vaccine development. 49 In this instance, we started with the preferable target, namely, the envelope glycoprotein, but failed to identify any unique conserved region ( Figure S1 ; multiple-sequence alignment of the envelope glycoprotein of CCHFV.) to design a peptide vaccine against the envelope glycoprotein. This was also revealed by phylogeny analysis, which is shown in Figure S3 ; phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary divergence among the different envelope glycoproteins of CCHFV. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a product of the L-segment of the genome, comprises a unique conserved region among all the available strains of CCHFV ( Figure S2 ; multiple-sequence alignment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV). This was the pedestal to think about a novel vaccine candidate. To ensure a firm immune response, we looked for the activation of both T-cell and B-cell immunity with a single epitope. 50 Antigenicity of the conserved peptides indicated their ability to provoke potential immune response and they were used for further analysis involving T-cell epitope prediction. Through the analysis of the output of both NetCTL and CTLPred, it was found that the epitope \"DCSSTPPDR\" would be the best candidate for the activation of T-cell immunity with potential antigenicity. Analysis of the MHC ligands for both type I and II revealed that the core epitope \"DCSSTPPDR\" would interact with the highest number of HLA molecules and that it would support the MHC molecules to present the epitope on the T-cell surface. The complete peptide for MHC-II restriction was FIACADCSSTPPDRW. The peptide DCSSTPPDR was also found to be the most potential candidate to raise B-cell immune response by amino acid-based B-cell epitope In order to see the exact location of the proposed epitope of the protein (shown spherically in Figure 6A ), the three-dimensional structure of the conserved peptide was modeled. This predicted model was validated with Ramachandran Plot (Figure 6B ), whereby 89.8% amino acid residues were found within the favored region. The disorderliness of the peptide remains outside of the proposed epitope region, which would secure the functioning of our predicted epitope (Figure 7) .",

            "text": "The most important feature of an epitope enabling its use as a vaccine is its conservancy. Conservancy analysis of the proposed epitope found 100% conservancy among all the available sequences. Another important criterion of the peptide vaccine is its allergenicity 51 ; our proposed epitope was examined in silico and found to be nonallergenic in nature. A recent study in designing a vaccine against CCHFV targeting the envelope glycoprotein showed a high success rate in a mouse model. 52 But because it is a structural protein, the rate of mutation is higher than that of nonstructural proteins such as RNA polymerase, 53 a phenomenon that has been evidenced in our study through sequence analysis. As our proposed epitope is shown to be 100% conserved among different CCHF strains, we suggest that it will be the best possible candidate for vaccine designing. Epitope-based vaccine designing is now becoming more popular and already has been established for rhinovirus, 54 dengue virus, 55 human corona virus, 56 and some others. This type of work has also been proven in vitro. 57 So, considering the above analysis,we predict that our proposed epitope would also trigger an immune response in vitro.",
