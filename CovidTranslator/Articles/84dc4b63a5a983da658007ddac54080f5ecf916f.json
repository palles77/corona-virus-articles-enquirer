Therefore, in this study, a GAM with a Gaussian distribution family (Hastie, 2017; was applied to examine the moving average lag effect (lag0-7, lag0-14, lag0-21) of mean temperature on daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. The model was defined as follows: According to the results from the GAMs, then we used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases in detail (Cheng et al., 2019; Duki\u0107 et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2008) . In the sensitivity analysis, we first excluded Wuhan city from our data because it was the worst-hit region in China and the number of confirmed cases was much larger than that of other cities. Second, we changed the maximum degree of freedom for the spline function to 3 to examine whether our main results were robust.",

Tan et al. (2005) found that the optimum environmental temperature related to SARS cases was from 16 \u00b0C to 28 \u00b0C based on data from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan. Moreover, Bi et al. (2007) reported that temperature had a negative relationship with SARS transmission in Hong Kong and Beijing in 2003. A laboratory study using surrogate viruses to investigate the effect of temperature on coronavirus survival on surfaces showed that viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 20\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C (Casanova et al., 2010) . Another laboratory study found that coronavirus on smooth surfaces was stable for over 5 days when temperature at 22 \u00b0C-25 \u00b0C, and virus viability was rapidly lost at higher temperatures (e.g., 38 \u00b0C) (Chan et al., 2011) . Van Doremalen et al. (2013) also observed that MERS-CoV was less stable at high temperature. In brief, most studies showed that there was an optimum temperature for coronavirus and high temperature was harmful to its viability. However, this paper could not observe a negative effect of high temperature on COVID-19 infection. A possible reason may be that the study period was limited in winter, with maximal mean temperature 26.9 \u00b0C. Further laboratory studies also need to be conducted to determine the underlying mechanism.",
