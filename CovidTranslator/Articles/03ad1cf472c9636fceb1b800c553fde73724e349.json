In particular, this study pays attention to formulating a mathematical model for MERS transmission dynamics and estimating transmission rates. Methods: Incidence data of MERS-CoV from the government authority was analyzed for the first aim and a mathematical model was built and analyzed for the second aim of the study. A mathematical model for MERS-CoV transmission dynamics is used to estimate the transmission rates in two periods due to the implementation of intensive interventions. Results: Using the estimates of the transmission rates, the basic reproduction number was estimated in two periods. Due to the superspreader, the basic reproduction number was very large in the first period; however, the basic reproduction number of the second period has reduced significantly after intensive interventions. Conclusion: It turned out to be the intensive isolation and quarantine interventions that were the most critical factors that prevented the spread of the MERS outbreak. The results are expected to be useful to devise more efficient intervention strategies in the future.",

            "text": "One of the most significant events in South Korea in 2015 was the introduction and diffusion of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It is a novel coronavirus which was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 [1] . After that, MERS-CoV exhibited outbreaks in several regions and the last one was in South Korea (at the time of writing). It is known as having a high fatality rate and having a resemblance in clinical features with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] , thus, it has drawn much concern both from the public health authority and the general public when the first index case was identified in May 2015, for the first time in Korea. In the case of the outbreak in South Korea, it is characteristic in that a single importation of the pathogen sparked a large cluster of infected cases, while sporadic importations did not lead to local outbreaks in other regions [3] . It was surprising because South Korea has been said to have one of the most advanced medical and public health systems in the world [4] , and it raises fears that the situation would be much worse in countries with less developed public health systems. Thus, the investigation of this study about the South Korean incidence is expected to give an invaluable lesson both to public health authorities around the world and the community of epidemiology researchers. Moreover, it might be able to provide a quantified result with mathematical modeling and statistical analysis, which is beneficial given that the studies about the South Korean case are largely comprised of epidemiological descriptions [4, 5] .",

Breban et al [11] compared the possibility of MERS-CoV being pandemic by comparing the basic reproduction number (Appendix) with that of SARS. Using MERS-CoV outbreak data, Chowell et al [12] delved further and calculated two reproduction numbers based on different epidemiological scenarios: one is when all reported zoonotic cases are severe and the other is not. Chowell et al [3] took a different approach that compared the reproduction numbers in SARS and MERS-CoV in large hospital clusters.",

First of all, whether some demographic characteristics, such as age or sex, and locations have influence on the possibility of being infected needs to be explored. Also, the transmissibility needs to be investigated with more detail. As done in some literature, transmissibility in hospitals and in general need to be calculated separately and it needs to be taken into consideration whether the transmissibility might change in time. Here, the SIR-type mathematical modeling is of great use, while there are very few in MERS-CoV studies. Its usefulness might be boosted if combined with real-world data, which will be done in the present study.",

In Chowell et al [12] , the actual data of the zoonotic case were gathered so they were able to take secondary cases as well as index cases into account.

The average age of MERS-CoV confirmed cases is 55 years and that of death patients is 69.8 years, while that of the total population in South Korea is 38.9 years in 2015. These differences were statistically significant and age is related both to susceptibility and mortality of MERS-CoV. Next, Chi-square test was conducted in order to investigate whether sex, region, and/or visited hospital had any relationship with mortality of MERS-CoV. The result shows that mortality was different by region and visited hospital, while it was not by sex. We also tested whether patients' sex was different by age, region, and/or category of patients (health workers, epidemiological survey, or visitor/family). According to the result, the sex of patients was not related to age and region, but it was significantly different by the category of patients. Finally, we investigated whether sex, region, and mortality are related to the number of cases by generation; in other words, it was investigated whether mortality increased or decreased as the disease spread further. The result of Chi-square test demonstrates that the number of cases by generation was not related to age while it was different by region and mortality (more details are given in Appendix).",

Since the primary case was exposed to MERS-CoV during their stay in the Middle East, the patient and his wife are assumed to be in the exposed class of our system before the confirmation day (May 20, 2015). In Figure 1 , the data of MERS-CoV incidence (+) and its best fit (solid curve) of incidence Eq. (1) are plotted from May 6, 2015 to July 4, 2015. The MERS-CoV incidence is defined as the number of newly infected individuals per day. The figure demonstrates that our fitted MERS-CoV model fits well to the reported incidence data. In the figure, we can see the trend of logistic curve; thus, we split up the time into two periods (May 6, June 7 and June 7, July 1) where the rate of change is in its increasing and decreasing trend respectively. Due to the implementation of intensive interventions at June 7, each period has its own remarkable trend, thus, parameters are estimated in each period. Two kinds of transmission rates are estimateddtransmission rate b and transmissibility of hospitalized patients ldbecause many MERS-CoV patients are infected in hospitals and it is assumed that the value of hospitalized transmissibility l is bigger than transmission rate b. Parameter values used for simulation are listed in Table 2 .",

This raises the importance of timely and accurate countermeasures. In order to devise efficient intervention strategies, it is critical to understand both the biological characteristics of the disease and the social response of the location where the disease spreads or is likely to spread. It is because these two aspects in combination determine the mode of diffusion of the infectious disease. In this regard, it is crucial to investigate the characteristics of MERS-CoV transmission in South Korea since it can demonstrate the current capability and the future potential of South Korea to resist infectious disease. This study tried to meet this need by examining which demographic group is more susceptible using incidence data and estimating transmission rates of general and hospitalized populations. The result of this study is expected to have theoretical and practical implications.",

Also, the role of the media in the spread of MERS-CoV in South Korea can be investigated.

The ongoing outbreak in South Korea began when the primary case developed respiratory illness on May 11, 2015 after returning on May 4, 2015 from the Middle East (April 24 th eMay 4 th ). Further epidemiological investigation showed that the primary case had also traveled to the Barain, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The first symptom, which included fever, muscle aches, cough, and dyspnea, was detected on May 11 th , 2015. On May 20 th , 2015, he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV, so the patient was isolated and treated in hospital designated by the Korea government. After that, MERS-CoV spread in South Korea from the man, and we currently have 186 confirmed cases including 36 death cases (July 7, 2015). Table A1 shows three kinds of characteristics of confirmed cases; age group, sex, and occupation. In occupation, infected patients are classified into three groups; Health Workers, Epidemiologic Survey, and Visitor/Family. We can derive the mortality rates by occupation from the numbers in the table, which are 2.6% in health workers, 25.6% in Epidemiologic Survey, and 17% in Visitor/Family, and we can see that the mortality rate is the highest in Epidemiologic Survey. Figure A1 presents the time, the location, and the number of infections by the primary patient until he was isolated, and Table A2 displays the number of infected cases by the hospitals that the primary patient had visited before isolation. As the table shows, while it was Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital where the primary case was confirmed, Samsung Medical Center was the location where the largest number of people were infected. It also draws attention that the number of cases decreases by the order of infection in Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital while it tends to increase in Samsung Medical Center. Figure A2 illustrates a transmission tree that MERS-CoV spread from primary case to 153 cases on June 15, 2015. The number of first-order infected cases is 39, that of second-order infected cases is 104, and that of thirdorder infected cases is seven.
