Virions obtained from these cultures showed the typical eoronavirus morphology by negative staining (3) . Human coronaviruses have been studied extensively by negative staining of cell and organ culture fluids but until recently have not been seen or described in clinical material (6) . UltrastructurM changes following replication of coronaviruses in cell cultures have been reported by a number of workers (15) . However, there are no similar reports which describe ultrastructurM changes following replication in human organ cultures. The present electron microscopical investigation was undertaken to study the morphology by negative staining of the newly described human enteric coronaviruses (5) and to compare them with two animal enteric coronaviruses, namely, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of pigs and neonatal calf diarrhoea virus. In addition observations were made on the ultrastructural changes associated with the replication of this human enteric coronavirus in human foetal intestinal organ cultures. Infection of the organ cultures with this non-laboratory adapted virus represents a model system as close as possible to the in vivo situation and it may be postulated that t, he changes which occurred in the organ cultures may also occur in the intact host.",

The virions had radiating projections (approximately 20 nm in length) giving the characteristic appearance of coronaviruses ( Fig. I A) . All of the virions had thin radiating projections which possessed spherical or tear drop-like dilations at the distal end. Some of the particles had a T-shaped structure ~ttached to the distal end of the projection (Fig. 1 B) . These virions were not as pleomorphic as those present in the faecal emulsions and the majority ranged in size from 100 to 200 nm (inclusive of projections). The projections on the surface of the virions were identical to those on the virions seen in the faecal emulsions with the exception that no T-shaped structures were observed (Fig. 1 C) . Some virions had lost many of the surface projections ( Fig. 1 D) . There was a dramatic increase in the number of extracellular virions present in the 24 hours post-inoculation fluids compared with the 6 hours post-inoculation fluids. At 6 hours post-inoculation 27 particles were counted in five squares of a 250 mesh grid, whereas at 24 hours post-inoculation there were 243 particles in five grid squares. A t~i c a t field of the 24 hours fluid is shown in Figure 2 . Of particular interest in the virions shown in Figure 1 C, D and Figure 2 was the consistent appearance of the central electron-dense area. This has also been reported with other coronaviruses. However the virus envelopes appeared to be completely collapsed in the particles seen in the faeces (Fig. t A, 1 B) . ",

The occasional non-membrane bound cytoplasmic inclusion bodies which were seen (Fig. 6 ) may represent viral precursors as suggested by OsHmo st al. (17) . The role of these tubular inclusions in the developmental cycle of the virus can only be ascertained by a sequential study. Figure 5A (arrowed) and 5B show densely staining tubular filaments found only in infected cells. The diameter of these filaments is larger than the diameter of cytoplasmic microfilaments commonly seen in non-infected and infected ceils (Fig. 6 arrows) , Furthermore they are much shorter in length. However, the diameter of these filaments (9--10 rim) is similar to that reported by APOSTOT,OV st al.",
