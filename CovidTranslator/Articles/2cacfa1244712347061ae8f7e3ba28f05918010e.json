Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was first described in the U.S. in 1987 [9] . A similar disease referred to as porcine epidemic abortion and respiratory syndrome (PEARS) was then reported in Europe [17] . PRRSV was first isolated in Europe and is believed to be widespread in swine population around the world [4, 21, 22] . All European isolates of PRRSV are antigenically and genetically related, whereas there are antigenic variations between US and European isolates as well as among US isolates [1, 16, 21] . The complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of LV has been determined [14] , but until recently limited information was available about the molecular structure of the genome of North American isolates of PRRSV [10] [11] [12] [13] . We have previously reported the cloning and sequencing of the ORFs 5 to 7 ofa U.S. isolate of PRRSV VR2385 of high virulence [12] . The 3' end of the genome of the VR2385 and the other U.S. PRRSV isolates showed a striking difference when compared to the European isolates [13] . In this study, we report on the cloning and sequencing of the ORFs 2-4of the U.S. isolate VR2385.",

The CRL11171 cells were infected with VR2385 virus at a M.O.I. of 0.1 and the total RNA from infected cells was isolated at 24 h post infection by using a guanidinium thiocyanate method [18] . Polyadenylated RNA was enriched, reverse transcribed and cloned into the )~ ZAP vector using the Uni-Zap cDNA cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A PCR probe generated by ORF 4 specific primers DP585 (5'GCTTTGCTGTCCTCCAAG 3') and DP586 (5'GATGCCTGACACATTGCC 3') [11] were used to screen the library. Plaques that hybridized with the probe were isolated and purified. The phagemids containing viral cDNA inserts were rescued by in vitro excision using ExAssist helper phage and E. coli SOLR cells (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA). Several recombinant phagemids with virus specific cDNA inserts with sizes ranging from 2.3 to 3.9 kb were selected and sequenced by Sanger's dideoxynucleotide chain termination method [19] with an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Universal, reverse and specific internal primers were used to determine the sequence. At least 3 independent clones representing sequence of the ORFs 2 to 4 were sequenced. The sequencing data was assembled and analyzed using Mac Vector (International Biotechnologies, Inc., CT) and GeneWorks (IntelliGenetics, CA) computer programs. The nucleotide sequence reported in this paper has been deposited in the GenBank with the accession number U20788.",

            "text": "Analysis of the nucleotide sequence identified three partially overlapping ORFs. The ORF 2 extended from nucleotide 28 to 795, ORF 3 from 651 to 1412, and ORF 4 from 1196 to 1729. There was an overlap of 144 bp between ORFs 2 and 3, and 216 bp between ORFs 3 and 4. Surprisingly, no overlap was found between ORFs 4 and 5. The start codon ofORF 5 was located 10 bp downstream of the stop codon of ORF 4. However, the ATG start codon of ORF 5 and TGA stop codon of ORF 4 overlapped by only t bp in LV [5, 14] . The sequence at the region of the ORF 4 and ORF 5 junction of LV is ATATGA. We sequenced the corresponding region of 5 additional independent clones of VR2385 and in all cases the sequence of this region of VR2385 was ATTTGA. The point mutation from A to T in VR2385 and probably some other unidentified changes in this region of VR2385 made the ORF 5 ATG start codon 10 bp downstream of the stop codon of ORF 4, and a 10 bp non-coding region appeared in the ORF 4 and 5 junction of VR2385. The characteristics ofORFs 2 to 4 of VR2385 are summarized in Table 1 . The ORF 2 encodes a 256 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted size of 29.5 kDa. The carboxy and amino terminus of the predicted protein are hydrophobic (data not shown) and there are two potential N-glycosylation sites in the ORF 2 protein. ORF 3 encodes a protein of 254 amino acids and contains 7 potential N-glycosylation sites. The amino terminus of the ORF 3 protein is extremely hydrophobic. ORF 4 encoded a 178 amino acid protein with a predicted size of 19.5 kDa. The amino and carboxy termini and 4 regions within the protein are highly hydrophobic. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of VR2385 and LV showed extensive variations. Nucleotide sequence identity between VR2385 and LV is 65% for ORF 2, 64% for ORF 3 and 66% for ORF 4. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of ORFs 2-4 of VR2385 and LV is presented in Fig. 1 . Amino acid identity between VR2385 and LV is 58% for ORF 2, 56% for ORF 3 and 67% for ORF 4. We also compared the sequence ofVR2385 ORF 4 with that of MN-lb, another US isolate of PRRSV [10]. The ORF 4 of VR2385 is 21 bp longer and shares an 88% nucleotide sequence homology with MN-Ib. The amino acid homology between the ORF 4 of VR2385 and MN-lb is 86% (Fig. lc) . Several deletions were found in the ORF 4 of MN-lb compared to VR2385.",

Our data indicates that the proteins encoded by ORFs 2~, of VR2385 possess characteristics similar to those of LV and probably are envelope or membrane associated glycoproteins because of their hydrophobicity and presence of potential glycosylation sites. Further work is necessary to determine the roles of these proteins. The variability found in the ORF 4 sequence between the two U.S. isolates correlate with the findings that ORF 4 protein of the MN-lb expressed in E. coli reacted with only 65% of PRRSV positive sera by Western blot analysis [10] .",

All subgenomic mRNAs contain a common leader sequence derived from the 5' noncoding region of the viral genome. The site of the leader-mRNA junction is similar and located upstream of the start codon of each ORF. The consensus leader-mRNA junction sequence of the six subgenomic mRNAs of LV was determined to be (U/A)(C/U/A)(A/ G)ACC [15] . Similar sequences were also found as leader-mRNA junction regions for LDV [3] . The potential leader-mRNAjunction motifs ofORFs 2 to 4 of VR2385 was proposed and compared with those of LV ( Table 2 ). The last four nucleotides of the motif for ORFs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 in LV are AACC, and for ORF 3 is GACC. The AACC motif has been found upstream of ORFs 6 and 7 of VR2385 [12] as well as ORFs 2 and 3. There are two potential junction regions for ORF 3, 83 bp and 35 bp upstream of the ORF 3 start codon, respectively (Table 1) . No AACC motif was found upstream ofVR2385 ORFs 4 and 5. However, the sequences UUGACC and CAGACC upstream of ORF 4, UUGACC and GAGACC upstream of ORF 5, may be the leader-mRNA junction regions for the mRNAs 4 and 5 of VR2385. Multiple potential leader-mRNA junction sites suggest that polymorphism of subgenomic mRNAs may exist among PRRSV isolates. Experiments to determine the exact locations ofleader-mRNAjunction regions are now in progress.",
