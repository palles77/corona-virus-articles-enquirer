The amplified PCR products of TGEV HB06 were cloned, sequenced, and compared with other TGEV strains genes selected from the GenBank. Then, the recombinant fragment in pMD18-T was subcloned into corresponding sites of prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1 after digestion with EcoRI and XhoI to construct a recombinant fusion expression vector pGEX-6P-M. Then, the verified recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rossetta (DE3), and the expression of M fusion protein was induced by using isopropylthio-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG) as inducer. The results showed that the gene fragment of M at a length of 789 bp was amplified and cloned into the vector pMD18-T successfully, and sequence comparison with that reported in GenBank revealed that the M gene complete sequence shares more than 94% homology in nucleotide. The result of SDS-PAGE showed that the recombinant membrane protein had a molecular mass of approximately 56 kDa, which was the same as the expected results. It was proven by Western blotting that the recombinant membrane protein had strong positive reactions with TGEV-specific antibody. Therefore, the expressed fusion protein has a good antigenicity. This work established a good foundation for further studies on the production of anti-TGEV vaccines.",

The disease is especially severe in newborn animals less than two weeks old, in which mortality approaches 100% (Siddell et al., 1983; Sturman and Holmes, 1983; Saif and Bohl, 1986) . Statistics showed that 39.8% of dead pigs in China died of diarrhea and 10.3% were caused by TGEV. Transmissible gastroenteritis has become one of the severe viral diarrhea diseases in young pigs that lead to severe economic loss in pig farming. However, because of the similarity between transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and porcine epidemic diarrhea in clinical signs and pathology, there is no effective method in the country to distinguish one from the other accurately.",

            "text": "The TGEV is a member of the Coronaviridae family, a family of pleomorphic enveloped viruses. It possesses a large 28.5-kb single-stranded sense RNA genome Laude et al., 1993; Vaughn et al., 1995) and is comprised of four structural proteins encoded by the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleoprotein (N) genes. The S protein, which has characteristics similar to those of spike proteins from other viruses, is the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies (Delmas et al., 1986; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 1986; Correa et al., 1988; Gebauer et al., 1991) . The M protein, however, differs markedly from other viral proteins in structure, processing, and intracellular transport (Sturman and Holmes, 1985) and induces antibody-dependent complement mediated virus neutralization (Delmas et al., 1986; Woods et al., 1987) . Although its function is unclear, the M protein is required for virus assembly and budding in contrast to the S protein, which is not essential for these activities as reported for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Rottier et al., 1981; Sturman, 1981; Sturman and Holmes, 1985; de Haan et al., 1998) . Numerous studies have shown that the M gene of TGEV is highly conserved. Therefore, the M gene will be an ideal candidate for cloning and expression in the development of TGEV diagnostic antigen.",

Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained. For Western blot analysis, the induced proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Towbin et al., 1979) by semidry blotting. The membranes were blocked at room temperature with blocking buffer (5% w/v bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T)) for 1 h, followed by three washings with PBS-T. All incubations were performed on a rocking platform and followed by three washings with PBS-T. The TGEVspecific antisera was diluted at 1\u2236500 in blocking buffer, incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-swine immunoglobulin (Ig)-specific polyclonal antibody (goat anti-mouse-IgG-HRP, Sigma, USA) diluted at 1\u22361000 in blocking buffer, and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The color reaction was developed using 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as substrates (Harlow and Lane, 1988 ).",

Considering the challenges of TGE treatment, it is desirable to develop a vaccine to prevent TGEV infection. The M gene of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus is very conservative when compared with other proteins, which have good antigenicity. A previous study showed that the M protein induces antibody-dependent complement mediated virus neutralization (Delmas et al., 1986; Woods et al., 1987) .
