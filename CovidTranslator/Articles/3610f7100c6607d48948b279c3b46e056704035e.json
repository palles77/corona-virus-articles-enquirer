The causative agent of SARS has been identified to be a new type of coronavirus, namely SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [5, 8, 14] . Shortly after the 1 st reported case in Guangdong, southern China, in late 2002 [2] , outbreaks of SARS spread to Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, and other areas, including Taiwan. As of June 30, 2003, 8,447 prob-K A R G E R able SARS cases including 811 deaths had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 32 countries or regions worldwide. The 1 st case of SARS in Taiwan, a 54-year-old male who returned from a business trip to Guangdong, was diagnosed and reported in early March 2003 [16] . Subsequently, a large outbreak took place in late April partly due to an unrecognized SARS index patient who made multiple visits to different hospitals and exposed many patients, visitors, and health care workers [9] , resulting in 678 probable cases and 84 deaths in Taiwan by the end of June [3] .",

Like other known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing three envelope proteins, namely membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, together with the viral RNA genome, presumably tbrms a helical core located inside the viral envelope. Based on the structure of all known coronaviruses, the M protein, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is the most abundant protein in the virus particle, while the E protein is present in a minute amount in the viral envelope. In some coronaviruses, the S protein has been shown to bind to cellular receptors on the host cell surface. Generally, the immune response against the S protein is believed to prevent viral attachment and entry into host ceils.",

            "text": "At the very beginning of the SARS outbreak, the case definition for SARS was merely based on clinical history and symptoms. However, after confirmation that SARS-CoV was the causative agent, laboratory methods, including viral isolation, nucleic acid tests, and serological tests, were quickly developed and were accepted as one of the categories for a SARS diagnosis [ 17] . Even though the RT-PCR or the real-time PCR is currently the most sensitive technique for detecting SARS-CoV, its positive rate for probable SARS cases is around 38% according to data of the Center for Disease Control of Taiwan (CDC-Taiwan). This is likely because specimens might not be obtained at an optimal time point during the course of the SARS-CoV infection, or specimens might be taken improperly, especially for nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat swabs. Thus, it was suggested that multiple and repeated collections of nasopharyngeal, throat, and fecal samples be taken in order to increase the positive rate determined by RT-PCR. In addition to nucleic acid tests, serodiagnosis of SARS is also important. Given that SARS is a new disease in humans, antibodies against SARS-CoV should not be detected in people who have not been exposed to the virus; an antibody occurring in sera would be a useful index for SARS infection. It was reported that IgG against SARS-CoV was detectable in convalescent sera using SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells as antigens in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [ 13] .",

Because humoral immunity displays different isotypes of antibodies, including IgA, IgG, and IgM, during the infection, we thus evaluated whether these antibodies could be used as diagnostic indices for SARS infection.

Noticeably, the antibody response of IgA to N protein was initiated as early as day 2 or 3 after illness onset, with a sevenfold increase which progressively increased to 15-fold within 1 month (fig. 4A ). The increased multiples of antibodies to N protein were significantly higher than those of M proteins and S proteins according to the paired t-test (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The responses of IgM and IgG to N protein were similar to that of IgA. However, they appeared on days 10 and 16, respectively, after the onset of illness. The M protein could be detected by IgA or IgG. The antibody response to M protein was much lower than that to N protein ( fig. 4A-C) .

These findings indicate that the recombinant proteins of N, M, $5, and $6 may be useful as antigens to detect specific antibodies against SARS-CoV. Moreover, large amounts of recombinant proteins can easily be obtained in an E. coli system which offer several advantages over the antigens prepared from virus-infected cells, such as decreasing the risk of infection and ease of performing the assay with standardization.",

The weak signal of IgM might have resulted from the characteristics of IgM itself, since the affinity of IgM to antigens is relatively low as compared with that of IgG or IgA. Therefore, the detectable sensitivity of IgM to SARS-CoV proteins is limited. The human respiratory tract has been proposed to be the major site of SARS-CoV infection in humans, and it is totally covered with mucosal surfaces. Not only do cellular immune responses result from mucosat infection by intracellular pathogens, but also secretory IgAs are produced to function as another important defense mechanism against invasion of deeper tissues by these pathogens [18] . Therefore, the synthesis of specific IgA antibodies in the early stage of a SARS-CoV infection is reasonable, and this phenomenon was also observed in other studies related to coronaviruses [4, I0, 12] . For example, Loa et al. [10] reported that the specific IgA antibodies against a turkey coronavirus were initially detected in serum 1 week after oral inoculation; these gradually increased and reached a peak at week 4 and finally declined at weeks 6-9. Furthermore, we noted that all three classes of immunoglobulins reacted with N and S antigens, but the antibody response of IgM to S antigen was much lower than that of IgA or IgG. Whether this phenomenon is significant for the immunological role of IgA, IgG, or IgM in SARS patients requires more detailed investigation. Table 4 illustrates that RT-PCR was more sensitive than WB during the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection. However, WB was more sensitive than RT-PCR, if sera were collected in the convalescent phase of the illness. In general, the combined use of RT-PCR and WB raised the positive rate from 48.1 to 72.2% for probable SARS patients. Taken together, our data indicate that the use of recombinant protein-based WB along with RT-PCR can increase the rate of confirmation of suspected SARS patients.",

Since the data were pooled from many patients, we do not know whether this pattern was truly significant or merely due to variations among different individuals. Nonetheless, it is still valuable to elucidate the trend of antibody responses in different classes of immunoglobulins against various SARS-CoV antigens during the course of the infection.In summary, our data suggest that WB using recombinant proteins N, M, $5, and $6 as antigens to detect various classes of immunoglobulins might provide an alter-native method for the early detection of SARS-CoV infection. In addition, detection of specific IgA antibodies at the very early stage of the illness may be valuable for monoclonal antibodies or vaccine development to combat the SARS-CoV infection.",
