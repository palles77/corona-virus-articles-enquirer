These infiltrates are almost indistinguishable in pattern and cell distribution from experimentally induced lesions of autoimmunized animals. Various models of experimentally induced autoimmune inflammation of the nervous system have been extremely informative for better understanding certain stages of MS.

Also in most cases where EAE was transferred, T lymphocytes of the T-helper/DTH effector phenotype were most probably the active cell [20] . Recently, a demyelinating disease could be transferred by T cells [18] .

Specific immune factors can be responsible for the destruction of the myelin sheath and myelinating cells. Thus, it has long been known that antibodies against myelin determinants can destroy myelin in vivo and in vitro. Autoantibodies against galactocerebroside and whole myelin, but not anti-MBP antibodies were predominant demyelinating immunoglobulins [26] . Much less clear is the contribution of myelin-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which potentially could demyelinate by directly attacking and lysing myelinated membranes. Experimental support for myelin-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes comes from the immunocytochemical demonstration of T lymphocytes with \"suppressor/cytotoxic T cell phenotype\" in EAE or MS lesions. Except for one study, where in actively induced EAE of strain 13 guinea pigs, MBP-specific cytolytic T cells were demonstrated lysing MBP-coated syngeneic macrophages [1] , little convincing evidence for the existence or role of myelin-specific cytolytic T cells has been provided so far.",

It cannot be ruled out that this phenomenon has also some role in vivo, but it should be emphasized that bystander demyelination would be confined to the immediate surrounding of the actual immune reaction, and therefore cannot easily account for formation of a whole demyelinating plaque. In addition, myelin can be destroyed by mechanisms not directly related to immune effector mechanisms. Thus, in autoimmune neuritis, it has been shown that the edema caused by the autoimmune infiltrations can raise the intraneural pressure to a point to cause local ischemia [22] . Ischemic demyelination would be a secondary effect of the EAN response.

It is typical for MS that some neurologic deficits occur so fast and subside so rapidly that demyelination and remyelination cannot account for them. Similar to acute EAE, where neurologic symptoms occur in the absence of demyelination, nerve conduction may be impaired be either physical effects of edema formation, or by factors formed within the inflammatory infiltrates. A so far unrecognized mechanism of inflammatory disturbance of CNS nerve conduction was recently noted by Yarom et al. [36] . They found that myelin-specific T line cells can interfere with conduction in optic nerve explants within a few minutes. This block was reversible: after removal of the T lymphocytes, optic nerve conduction was resumed. Furthermore, the interaction was immune specific. Only myelin-specific T line cells blocked optic nerve function, and they acted only upon syngeneic, Ia-compatible tissue. The mechanism of this novel effect of immune cells on nervous function, and its relevance for clinical disease are incompletely understood at present. It is, however, possible that similar effects actively contribute to the generation of symptoms in multiple sclerosis and autoimmune encephalitis.",

In the following years, Ben-Nun et al. succeeded in developing a tissue culture system which permits establishment of permanently growing, clonable T cell lines from Lewis rats at an unprecedented high yield [3] . The essentials of this technique are based on two principles: activation of the antigen-specific T cell clones with antigen by presenter ceils and their propagation using growth factors. Several selective pressures are applied. First, rats are immunized with MBP/CFA which leads to an in vivo increase of T cells specific for the antigen MBP, but also for the PPD component of the CFA. Second, lymph node cells of the primed animals are restimulated in vitro with MBP which leads to blast transformation, expression of receptors for growth factors (interleukin 2, I1-2), and proliferation of the specific T cells. Third, the activated specific T blasts are separated from the irrelevant nonstimulated T cells on discontinuous density gradients. Finally, isolated T blasts are cultured in the presence of IL-2 which keeps them in rapid proliferation. Due to gradual loss of the I1-2 receptor during this expansion period, the proliferation rate eventually slows down and the T blasts revert back to small resting cells. In this stage the cells can be restimulated with antigen on presenter cells. This cyclic interchange of restimulation and expansion not only yields rapid selection for and expansion of T cells specific for the priming antigen, but also is the basis for monitoring the specificity of the T cells. Table 1 illustrates, how after only a few restimulation cycles, the T cells become exclusively specific for MBP and completely loose reactivity to the PPD component in the priming step. T lines provide a powerful tool to in vitro manipulate T cell activation by varying antigen presenting cells, antigen subfractions, blocking antibodies, and genetic combinations. Even more important, the activated T blasts are highly encephalitogenic when injected into normal syngeneic rats. Thus, the effector part of the T cell mediated autoimmune reaction can be studied separately in a highly specific and experimentally accessible way. ",

It became clear that in order to elicit an immune response, any antigen must be presented on a cell surface, and there it must be recognized in the context of determinants of the major histocompatibility gene complex (MHC). T helper/DTH lymphocytes recognize antigen in the context of Ia (class II) MHC determinants, whereas cytotoxic T cells recognize antigen only along with transplantation antigen of class I. MHC restriction is imposed on conventional foreign antigens, as well as on autoantigens. In the case of encephalitogenic rat T line cells, it has been found that all cells are restricted by Ia antigens. This is not surprising as all T lines expressed the rat T helper/DTH marker W3/25, and not the marker for cytotoxic cells OX8. The role of Ia antigen in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease is highly complex. First and foremost, by their function as a restriction element in antigen presentation, Ia determinants are centrally involved in genetic control of autoimmune susceptibility. However, as will become clear later, Ia determinants seem to have further roles in intercellular interactions, which are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Consequently, as will be discussed later, manipulation of Ia determinants most probably will become a novel and promising approach to therapeutically influence autoimmune disease. As already mentioned, encephalitogenic MBP-specific T lymphocytes recognize their antigen, MBP, only in the context of self Ia determinants. This was demonstrated using antigenpresenter cells of different MHC-recombinant and -congenic rat strains (Table 2) .",

Immediately with morphologic activation the T line cells, which in the quiescent state do not express demonstrable Ia antigens on their surface, acquire significant amounts of membrane bound Ia. In fact, expression of Ia on T lymphocytes has been regarded as an activation marker in several species, including man and mice. In an attempt to determine the cellular origin of the newly expressed T blast Ia, T line cells were activated either by MBP presented on syngeneic presenter cells or by the polyclonal mitogen Concanavalin A (ConA) in the presence of syngeneic or allogeneic presenter cells. A cytofluorometric analysis using a suitable panel of monoclonal antibodies against monomorphic and polymorphic Ia determinants demonstrated that in each case, the Ia phenotype of a T blast corresponded to the genotype of the presenter cells, and not to the genotype of the T line. Therefore, the Ia antigens transiently expressed on activated T line cells must be derived from the presenter cells, rather than being the biosynthetic product of the T line cells themselves. The physiologic role of the Ia antigens on the T blast is obscure. Acquired Ia certainly does not determine specificity in the efferent phase of EAE generation. T blasts were \"disguised\" with allogeneic Ia antigens in ConA cultures containing allogeneic presenter cells. The blast were then transferred in rats which were genetically identical with either the T lines, or with their adopted Ia. The lines, without exception, transferred clinical EAE only to T line-compatible rats (unpublished observation).",

This is certainly the case in experimentally induced autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and neuritis (EAN) models, where autoantigen is inoculated subcutaneously into foot pads and where the activated autoaggressive T lymphocytes must find their way to the actual target tissue, i. e., CNS or nerves. Target homing is especially impressive in EAE and EAN transferred by autoimmune T line cells [ 13] . These T line cells are selected for recognizing one myelin component, and depending on the tissue origin of the myelin determinant, the line cells will selectively cause either peripheral EAN or central EAE. Target specificity is a programmed property of the cells, and is independent of possibly co-transferred exogenous autoantigen, since the specific target pattern will be formed irrespectively of whether the line cells were activated by the nominal autoantigen presented by syngeneic cells, or by a T cell mitogen presented by allogeneic or syngeneic presenter cells.",

Classical antigenpresenting cells like macrophages or dendritic cells are absent in the brain parenchyme, but recent experiments have shown that autoantigens could be presented by astrocytes on the peripheral side of the BBB. It has been found that astrocytes produce Interleukin 1 [81, a T cell coactivating factor, and that they can present antigen to T cells in vitro and thus enter in a complex reciprocal interaction with T cells which not only leads to an immunospecific activation of the T cells but on the other side to increased expression of Ia antigens on astrocytes [9] . (Discussed in more details by Fontana in this series.) It is thus conceivable that astrocytes with their tight mesh net of processes could activate the T cells which penetrated the endothelium and basal membrane in the perivascular cuff.

It should affect only the autoaggressive lymphocyte clones, whereas all the other lymphocyte clones should be left unimpaired. Immunospecific strategies have been designed experimentally using both humoral as well as cellular agents. Among the humoral approaches, anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against the antigen-binding sites of autoantibodies or autoaggressive T cells have gained wide interest as well as humoral suppressor factors which are secreted either by autoreactive suppressor hybridomas or by suppressor lines. Another, semi-specific approach to manipulate autoimmune disease has been developed by Steinman et al. [28] . It has been known for some time that several autoimmune diseases are linked to the HLA system, especially to determinants of the HLA-D region. It appears that HLA-D regionencoded immune regulation genes (Ir genes) are directly responsible for T lymphocyte-mediated autoimmunity. The autoantigen is recognized by autoreactive T cells in the context of Ia antigens of the disease-prone HLA-D phenotype. Thus, since most humans are heterozygous in their HLA-D region, treatment with anti-Ia antibodies against the disease-associated Ia haplotype should preferentially interfere with the autoimmune reaction. All immune reactions depending on corecognition with this haplotype would be interfered with in addition, whereas the Recent experiments by Steinman and McDevitt suggest that a number of different Ir-gene regulated autoimmune diseases in rodents can be manipulated using this approach [28] . The exact site where in vivo applied anti-Ia antibodies could act is unknown. The antibodies could act at the primary stage of antigen presentation by presenter cells to T lymphocytes. They could furthermore bind to freshly activated T cells, which express Ia on their surface, and they could disturb the homing pattern of these cells. Anti-Ia antibodies could also bind to endothelial Ia molecules, which were postulated to be involved in T cell homing, and finally, anti-Ia could disturb the effector interaction between T cells and the CNS target. It remains to be established to what extent treatment in vivo with anti-Ia antibodies affects those ceils which express either constitutive or inducible Ia antigen, e.g., dendritic cells, macrophages, B lymphocytes, endothelia, and epithelia.",

Furthermore, the effect of irradiated T cells is exclusively prophylactic and does not influence ongoing disease. The mechanism of the T line vaccination effect is unclear to date. It should be stressed that it is immunospecific. Only MBP-specific T lines will interfere with EAE induction. Irradiated activated T line blasts of different specificity, in contrast, are ineffective. Recently, Holoshitz et al. [11] have established a different autoimmune T line model, which involves transfer of arthritis with rat T line cells specific for a determinant of mycobacteria. They found that one subclone which was ineffective in transferring disease to hosts, was fully capable of transferring protection to recipient rats. Another clone-transferred disease in the unirradiated activated state, but did not protect the hosts after irradiation. The molecular basis for this divergent behavior is unclear, its evaluation will, however, be of the highest interest for designing forthcoming therapeutic strategies. The alternative and more direct approach to immunospecific therapy with autoreactive T lines is the use of functionally suppressive T lymphocyte lines.

Both strains share the key regions of their MHC (class I and class II antigens are identical). They differ, however, in a MHC-related sublocus which is apparently the correlate of the murine Qa locus. Although both strains are identical in their I region, BS is resistant to active EAE induction, which is in contrast to Lewis, the classical susceptible strain. Bs line cells can transfer a mild EAE to syngeneic BS rats. Lewis rats are, however, completely resistant. We found, moreover, that transfer of viable activated bs cells, which would transfer EAE to BS rats, protects Lewis rats from subsequent active immunization with MBP/CFA. This protective effect in so far resembles protection of Lewis rats with irradiated autoaggressive line cells. Bs cells protect, in addition, Lewis rats from supralethal doses of Lewis-derived encephalitogenic T line cells. Furthermore, bs line cells act not only prophylactically, but they are able to actively suppress the encephalitogenic effect of supralethal doses of Lewis line cells. A dose of 10 x 106 bs cells suppresses the lethal effect of 2 x 106 Lewis-derived L.BP cells. Finally, bs cells can influence the course of actively induced EAE by injection after immunization. Bs cells injected i.v. 4 days after immunization of Lewis rats with MBP/CFA delay the onset of disease by 3-4 days, and reduce the amplitude of clinical signs. To date, it has, however, not been possible to completely abrogate established clinical EAE.",

            "text": "As in the other therapeutic models, the exact therapeutic mechanism of the bs line cells is not understood. We know that the suppression is immunospecific and unique to line bs. Bs cells, which are specific for guinea pig myelin basic protein, protect Lewis rats from central nervous system localized EAE. They are, however, ineffective in peripheral nervous system EAN, which was transferred by T line cells specific for the P2 protein of peripheral nerve myelin. In addition, a BS strainderived line specific for PPD does not protect from EAE, nor does another BSderived MBP-specific T line, BS.BP. Bs and BS.BP both recognize MBP and transfer mild EAE to BS rats. They differ, however, in their fine specificity pattern. Bs cells recognize only intact guinea pig myelin basic protein, but surprisingly none of their protease cleavage products, nor rat basic protein. BS.BP behaves similar to the Lewis line L.BP, recognizing both intact GP-MBP, as well as the cleavage peptide P1, and less so P2 and P4. Finally, they can also be stimulated to a modest degree by rat BP. It is not known at present whether and how this difference in fine specificity can be related to the protective effect ofbs. It is, however, clear that protection is an active action of the injected cells. Irradiation before transfer completely abrogates the protective effect. Furthermore, activated bs blasts are much more effective than quiescent medium size line cells, which are kept for prolonged periods in growth factor medium. Certainly suppression of encephalitogenicity of L.BP cells by bs line cells is not due to direct suppressive interaction. When cultured in vitro, both cells coexist and react against antigen independently without interfering with each other. It should also be noted that both L.BP and bs lines do not differ in any phenotypic marker. Both express the W3/25 determinant and lack OX8, which qualifies them as either T helper cells, or as effector cells in delayed type hypersensitivity reactions.",

            "text": "Although the effector mechanisms which lead to demyelination in autoimmune disease of the brain are still incompletely understood, several lines of evidence suggest that autoimmune myelin destruction occurs in several steps and that T cells play a pivotal role at least in the critical stage of autoantigen-specific inflammation. In the actively demyelinating lesions the predomiant cells of the mononuclear infiltrates are T lymphocytes. Furthermore, in contrast to the normal CNS which lacks Ia positive cells, inflammatory brain lesions contain a large number and a wide variety of Ia-bearing cells. Ia antigens, which are the product of the MHC-linked immune response genes, are a prerequisite for immunogenic antigen presentation to activate T cellular immune mechanisms. Ia antigens act at the molecular basis of the genetic control of autoimmune susceptibility and thus provide one target structure for manipulating autoimmune disease with monoclonal antibodies. The CNS cells which can express Ia have not been positively identified so far in vivo. The candidate cells include microglia and endothelial cells. It is remarkable that, in addition, astrocytes can be induced to express Ia in vitro, and are highly effective in presenting antigens to T cells. Whether the so-called \"reactive\" astrocytes in early demyelinating lesions have a similar function is an attractive possibility.",
