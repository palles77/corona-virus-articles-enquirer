            "text": "During recent decades, the typical patient with chronic sinus complaints has changed dramatically. Instead of a patient with chronic, unresolving, purulent maxillary sinusitis requiring radical surgery, otorhinolaryngologists are nowadays more and more often faced with a candidate for endoscopic sinus surgery, namely a patient who claims to be suffering from recurrent bacterial rhinosinusitis episodes following each viral respiratory infection [1] . If the patient has an underlying illness, such as gross congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; congenital mucociliary disease (eg, primary ciliary dyskinesia); cystic fibrosis or systemic vasculitis; or granulomatous diseases, the reason for the increased risk of bacterial sinusitis is clear [2\u2022\u2022] . However, this is often not the case, and, when examined, these patients are found to have normal nasal endoscopy and no CT evidence of sinus pathology [3] . The information on the exact pathomechanism of bacterial sinusitis is still scarce. However, viral respiratory infection is thought to be the major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of bacterial sinusitis and, therefore, the association of viral upper respiratory infections and susceptibility to recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis, which this review is focused on, is important. Further knowledge would help us to plan proper diagnostic and therapeutic measures for these patients.",

Respiratory viruses spread from person to person by viruscontaminated secretions, either via inhalation or via direct or indirect contact with infected secretions [4] . Mucociliary action transports the viruses to the posterior nasopharynx where the viruses gain entrance to epithelial cells by binding to specific receptors [5\u2022\u2022] . Once the epithelium is invaded, viral replication starts. This evokes strong inflammatory and immune response by the host. Release of various mediators, a cellular infiltration, vasodilation, and an increased vascular permeability characterize this response. Increased concentrations of mediators such as kinins; leukotrienes; histamine; interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-8; t u m o r n e c r o s i s f a c t o r ; a n d R A N T E S ( r e g u l a t e d by activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) have been measured in the nasal secretions of patients with colds [5\u2022\u2022] . The nasal cellular immune response includes increased neutrophil counts in the early phase followed later by elevated numbers of lymphocytes and mast cells [6, 7] . In addition, cholinergic stimulation leads to increased mucous gland secretion and sneezing [5\u2022\u2022] . Although some viruses can cause extensive damage to the ciliated cells and respiratory epithelium (eg, influenza viruses and adenoviruses), others have not been linked with marked histopathologic changes (eg, rhinoviruses).",

The pathologic changes in the paranasal sinuses seen during viral colds indicate impaired sinus drainage and ventilation.

The cytokine and mediator profiles in viral respiratory infection and acute and chronic rhinosinusitis are presented to be similar, with the exception of a small increase of eosinophilic cationic protein in chronic rhinosinusitis [2\u2022\u2022]. I am not aware that the amount of cytokines and other mediators during viral respiratory infection would have been compared in the sinusitis-susceptible and healthy controls. We compared the structural and cellular changes in the nasal mucosa during acute natural colds and convalescence in patients with allergic rhinitis, patients with susceptibility to sinusitis, and healthy controls [36] . A delayed accumulation of intraepithelial T cells was seen in the allergic and sinusitis-susceptible subjects, indicating a prolonged inflammatory reaction. Moreover, the sinusitis-susceptible subjects had small numbers of mast cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes in convalescence, which may be related to their susceptibility to bacterial complications [36] . Reportedly, the immunologic contents of the nasal secretion have been abnormal in the sinusitis-susceptible subjects as well [37] .",

Although certain anatomic variations, such as concha bullosa, nasal septal deviation, and a displaced uncinate process may contribute to ostial obstruction, the equal prevalence of these variations in patients with chronic sinusitis and healthy controls has been thought to indicate that they are not marked risk factors for sinusitis. However, although ostiomeatal complex obstruction and bony variation were equally frequent in sinusitis-susceptible individuals and healthy controls in our series as well, their impact on the functioning of paranasal sinuses was evident in the patients with sinusitis history, which may be associated with the increased risk for bacterial sinusitis [40] .

Facial pain is a symptom that patients do not think of as being associated with common cold but rather with sinusitis. In our series, the sinusitis-susceptible patients were found to have sinusitis-like symptoms, such as facial pain, during viral colds significantly more often and more severely than healthy controls [39] . Facial pain thresholds have been shown to vary in different conditions. For example, subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome are reported to have lower pain thresholds over their maxillary, frontal, and ethmoid regions compared with normal subjects, the possible reason being different neurogenic responses [45] .",
