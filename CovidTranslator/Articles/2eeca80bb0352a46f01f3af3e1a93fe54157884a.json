The quality of the overall hospital environment relies on the air-conditioning design, such as the control of temperature, humidity, pressure, and indoor air quality (IAQ), etc. Special design of air-conditioning and ventilating systems to maintain negative pressure within isolation rooms must be employed to protect health care workers and other patients. The purpose of maintaining negative internal pressure is to restrain the air and bacteria within isolation rooms. Suitable control of internal pressure and airflow direction within isolation rooms can effectively isolate infected patients and inhibit the spread of air and bacteria.",

These studies generally focused on analyzing the indoor air distribution, turbulence characteristics, thermal comforts, IAQ, etc. [1, 2] . Two methods, including experimental measurement and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, were commonly adopted in these studies. Because experimental measurement required a lot of time and expense, CFD simulation became one of the most economic and efficient tools to investigate indoor air movement. In order to make the simulation results reliable and accurate, much effort [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] was put into (i) inspecting the influence of different turbulence models, and various numerical schemes and algorithms on the simulation results; and (ii) the verification of simulation and experimental results. Unfortunately, there is still no unique turbulence model, numerical scheme or numerical algorithm valid for solving all indoor air motions. Hence, choosing a reliable turbulence model, numerical scheme and numerical algorithm can increase the accuracy of simulating indoor air motion.",

For instance, Gan [8] the upward displacement ventilation yielded better IAQ than other systems. Gan and Awbi [9] adopted the concept of age of air to assess the performance of air distribution systems, including IAQ and ventilation efficiency. Chung and Rankin [10] performed both experimental and numerical studies to evaluate the ventilation efficiency in a model room. They focused on the effect of the relative positions between air supply and return as well as location of partitions on the contaminant decay within a model room. Lee and Awbi [11] also performed a similar study using experimental and numerical methods. Within a model room, Hyun and Kleinstreuer [12] used the CFD simulation to examine the influence of airflow from different directions on the spread of carbon dioxide exhaled by a standing human.

The volume of the isolation room is the same as that of the previous case and the anteroom has the volume of 4 m (X) \u00c2 2.5 m (Y) \u00c2 1.5 m (Z). Both rooms are connected only by a sliding door with the frontal area of 0.8 \u00c2 2 m 2 and the thickness of 0.1 m. Assume that there is no airflow exchange between the two rooms when the sliding door is closed. The static pressure of the anteroom is specified by 0 Pa. Other boundary conditions are the same as those of the previous case. To study the influence of the pressure difference between both rooms on room air distribution, the pressure differences of 2.5 and 8 Pa are used. In order to maintain negative internal pressure within the isolation room, the static pressures of \u00c02.5 and \u00c08 Pa are given at the air outlet, respectively. Each action of opening and closing the door lasts for 2 s and the time duration for one cycle of opening and closing door is 4 s. After one cycle of opening and closing door is completed, the door is closed until the flow field reaches steady state. Grid elements of 76,842 and time step of 0.1 s are adopted in the dynamic analysis.",

They indicate that the internal pressure within the isolation room rises suddenly at the instant of opening the door and reaches the pressure of the anteroom after one second of opening the door. Due to the action of opening the door, the negative internal pressure disappears quickly and the pressures of both rooms equate quickly. At the moment of closing the door, the internal pressure of the isolation room suddenly rises to a higher pressure than that of the anteroom. When the door continues to close, the internal pressure drops quickly and becomes negative again. At the instant that the door is closed completely, the internal room pressure is lower than the specified negative internal pressure and it then rises rapidly to achieve the specified negative internal pressure. At the rest time of numerical simulation, the internal room pressure remains constant after it returns to the specified negative internal pressure. From the above discussion, it can be seen that no matter what the specified negative internal pressure is, the transient variations of internal room pressures have the same trends.",

Transient velocity fields are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 for two kinds of pressure differences between both rooms, showing that larger pressure difference induces more airflow into the isolation room during the period of opening door. Figs. 10 and 11 display the transient pressure distributions for two kinds of specified pressure differences, showing that the results have similar trends as those of Figs. 6 and 7. Because a larger pressure difference causes more airflow into the isolation room, it has a greater effect on removing the contaminant. Therefore, during the period of opening door, the area of isocontour of C d \u00bc 1=1000 for the condition of DP \u00bc 8 Pa is smaller than that of DP \u00bc 2.5 Pa, as shown in Figs. 12 and 13. However, after the door is closed, the surrounding areas of iso-contours for both kinds of specified pressure differences are almost the same, revealing that the contaminant transport is not affected by the magnitude of the specified pressure difference.",

(2) The opening and closing of a sliding door has profound effects on internal pressure and velocity distributions. It induces airflow into the isolation room from the anteroom and causes sudden rises and drops of the internal pressure during the periods of opening and closing door. Moreover, no matter what the specified pressure difference is, the pressure variations within the isolation room have the same trends. However, contaminant transport is affected only by the magnitude of the specified pressure difference during the period of opening door.

The exhaled gases consist of carbon dioxide with a mass fraction of 0.03861825.Those data for contaminant source are similar to that in Hyun and Kleinstreuer[12]. To investigate the effect of different speeds of a moving person on room air distribution, three constant moving speeds of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 m/s are employed. The moving person walks away from air supply and toward air outlet with straight-line motion. He walks back and forth once and stops at the original placeARTICLE IN PRESSFig. 3.

Grid-independence test is performed by two grid densities, 72,158 and 133,567 cells. The differences between the local velocity and concentration fields based on the 72,158 and 133,567 cells are insignificant. The gridindependence test proves the numerical robustness of FLUENT in solving this problem and a grid density with 72,158 cells is employed for the production runs. Time steps of 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 s, corresponding to the conditions with the moving speeds of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 m/s, are adopted in the transient airflow simulation. The steadystate solutions with zero speed of the standing person are employed as the initial conditions of dynamic analysis. The dynamic simulation terminates when the flow field achieves steady state, that is, there are no changes in the velocity, ARTICLE IN PRESS",

When the moving speed is equal to 0.25 m/s, transient velocity fields shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b) indicate that the moving person slightly disturbs room air distribution and a weak vortex flow develops behind it. However, Figs. 3(a) and (b) show uniform pressure distribution in this case. When the movement is faster, the variations of velocity and pressure fields become obvious and stronger vortex flow forms behind the moving person, as depicted in other Figs. 2 and 3. Although faster moving speeds result in larger velocity and pressure variations, those changes disappear and the flow field returns to the original state quickly, which usually takes less than 30 s after the moving person returns to the original position. To investigate the contaminant transport affected by the moving person, isocontours of dimensionless CO 2 concentration C d equal to 1/1000 are presented in Figs. 4(a)-(f). From these figures, it is found that the iso-contour is concentrated only near the mouth of the patient, and not spread out, no matter what the speed of the moving person is. If the standing person remains motionless, the same iso-contours as those of Figs. 4(a)-(f) is displayed in Fig. 5, revealing that the range of contaminant transport is limited only to the surrounding ARTICLE IN PRESS Fig. 5.
