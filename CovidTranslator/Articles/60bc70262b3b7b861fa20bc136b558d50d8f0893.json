Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a widely studied model system for Coronavirus replication and pathogenesis. In this study, we created a MHV-A59 temperature sensitive (ts) mutant Wu\"-ts18(cd) using the recombinant vaccinia reverse genetics system. Virus replication assay in 17C1-1 cells showed the plaque phenotype and replication characterization of constructed Wu\"-ts18(cd) were indistinguishable from the reported ts mutant Wu\"-ts18. Then we cultured the ts mutant Wu\"-ts18(cd) at non-permissive temperature 39.5\u00b0C, which \"forced\" the ts recombinant virus to use second-site mutation to revert from a ts to a non-ts phenotype. Sequence analysis showed most of the revertants had the same single amino acid mutation at Nsp16 position 43. The single amino acid mutation at Nsp16 position 76 or position 130 could also revert the ts mutant Wu\"-ts18 (cd) to non-ts phenotype, an additional independent mutation in Nsp13 position 115 played an important role on plaque size. The results provided us with genetic information on the functional determinants of Nsp16. This allowed us to build up a more reasonable model of CoVs replication-transcription complex.",

The majority of these proteins are encoded in two 5 '-proximal overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, translated as polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are then processed by virus-encoded proteinases into Nsp16 [4, 28, 32, 34] . Many of the Coronavirus Nsps have been shown or are predicted to have enzymatic functions [5, 11, 18, 26] . Nsp16 is predicted to be a Sadenosyl-methionine-dependent 2'-O-methyl transferase which is involved in the formation of viral 5'-cap structures [9, 16] . Whereas the exact role of Nsp16 during CoV replication is still unknown, its functional importance is supported by mutagenesis experiments using a SARS-CoV replicon system. The deletion of the Nsp16 coding sequence blocked RNA synthesis, whereas a single mutation in the catalytic tetrad reduced replicon driven mRNA synthesis to about 10% of the level for the wild type [37] .",

The Wu\"-ts18 is a reported ts mutant of wild-type MHV-A59 which fails to form plaques or synthesize viral RNA when infection is initiated and maintained at the non-permissive temperature, and produces smaller plaques than the wt virus at 37\u2103; the ts defects responsible for Wu\"-ts18 RNA-negative phenotype are caused by a single point mutation at Nsp16 position 12.
