Despite this effort, however, pharmacological options for ARDS remain scarce. Frequently cited reasons for this absence of specific drug therapies include the heterogeneity of patients with ARDS, the potential for a differential response to drugs, and the possibility that the wrong targets have been studied. Advances in applied biomolecular technology and bioinformatics have enabled breakthroughs for other complex traits, such as cardiovascular disease or asthma, particularly when a precision medicine paradigm, wherein a biomarker or gene expression pattern indicates a patient's likelihood of responding to a treatment, has been pursued. In this Review, we consider the biological and analytical techniques that could facilitate a precision medicine approach for ARDS. We would like to thank Edward Cantu III",

Nonetheless, in observational studies 7,8 from across the world, the mortality of patients with ARDS remains high; about one in three patients diagnosed with ARDS will not survive 60 days. Pharmacological treatments for ARDS remain scarce, with only one drug (cisatracurium besilate) showing a potential, albeit probably nonspecific, benefit in a randomised trial of 340 patients. 9 The need for new therapies for ARDS is indisputable, yet numerous well conceived studies have been unable to identify an effective treatment. 10- 14 Drugs might have been ineffective because responses to, or the toxic effects of, therapy are nonuniform; because of problems with drug timing, duration, or delivery; or because of incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis or heterogeneity of ARDS. [15] [16] [17] A precision approach, whereby therapies are specifically targeted to patients most likely to benefit, might overcome such limitations and is broadly advocated for ARDS. 18, 19 In this Review, we consider tools and approaches that might facilitate the identification of novel and potential precision therapies for ARDS by identifying the mechanisms and therapeutic relevance of specific biological pathways, by identifying subgroups of patients likely to respond to a particular therapy based on their biology, or (perhaps ideally) both.",

            "text": "Although continued investigation of selected candidate pathways, identified from experimental and obser vational investigations of ARDS, does and should continue, a complementary approach is to use discovery methods independent of any understanding of the pathogenesis of ARDS. Such \"biasfree\" approaches include assessing largescale variation in genomic DNA, transcriptome (mRNA) expression, noncoding RNA, proteins, lipids, or metabolites and comparing patients with ARDS with atrisk controls. Generally, the goal of such approaches is to identify novel candidates that can then be investigated in more traditional hypothesistesting experiments (figure 1). We stress that discovery approaches are not inherently superior to hypothesisdriven, candidate investigations, but rather that discovery approaches can bring new candidates to the pipeline of investigation. Discovery approaches are not predicated on our current understanding of ARDS biology but rather on the investigator's ability to select representative biospecimens and populations of patients and unaffected controls. Thus, such approaches are free from the biases introduced by our current molecular understanding of ARDS, such as which pathways are activated and which molecules incite or perpetuate lung injury. We refer to discovery approaches as biasfree when they are also independent of known genetic or proteomic sequences; for example, sequencing is biasfree, whereas a wholegenome gene expression array requires knowledge about transcripts to design specific probes (table 2) . Although a sceptic might view discovery approaches as akin to a fishing expedition, the broad goal of these studies is not to merely identify the most discriminatory marker between samples, but also to expand our consideration of pathways and mechanisms not presently thought to contribute to disease and to explain why an unexpected marker might differ significantly between cases and noncases or between target tissues.

One genomewide association study of trauma associated ARDS has been reported; 41 no single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) achieved genomewide significance, although a replicating variant in the liprin\u03b1 gene that warrants further mechanistic investigation was identified. This first attempt at a genomewide association study of ARDS was instructive for highlighting its insufficient power despite including 600 patients with ARDS and more than 2000 healthy controls in a discovery population, followed by an additional 500 critically ill patients in a replication population. 41 Although a genomewide association study is a powerful tool with reasonable consensus about analytical strategy, additional consid erations might restrict its application to a trait such as ARDS.

Discovery approaches exist to interrogate transcript expression (socalled transcriptomics), DNA modifi cations (socalled epigenomics), proteins, metabolites, and microbiota. The key technological shift that facilitated the explosion of these 'omic fields was the ability to perform highthroughput feature capture and identification without apriori designation of which features would be sampled. In the case of tran scriptomics, in which mRNA is the feature under investigation, the field has progressed from whole genome arrays-ie, microchips coated with thousands of oligonucleotide probes specific to the complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of roughly 22 000 known genes-to RNA sequencing, whereby cDNA or occasionally RNA is sequenced using nextgeneration sequencing technology. 48 The main advantage of RNA sequencing compared with microarrays is that RNA sequencing does not rely on probes designed to capture cDNA variation based on previous knowledge of the genome, but instead applies sequencing to all cDNA captured from the sample. 49 As a result of RNA sequencing investigations, we are gaining insight into the regulatory roles of noncoding RNA and small RNA species, the potential for alleles that do not change protein sequence to affect expression, and the complexity involved in isoform determination. 50 The challenges involved in applying RNA sequencing to a phenotype such as ARDS are not trivial and can be summarised as obstacles facing the broad field of transcriptomics-including developing bioinformatic solutions to highdimensional data analysis, quality assurance, and achieving a consensus on significance testing-and burdens that might be unique to ARDS. Burdens unique to ARDS are fundamental questions about study design: which tissue(s) should be profiled by RNA sequencing to discover new markers and inform about ARDS pathogenesis? Lung tissue is so rarely available while the patient is alive with early ARDS, 51 so are alveolar macrophages an adequate substitute? Kovach and colleagues 52 reported the first microarray analysis of human alveolar macrophages collected from broncho alveolar lavage fluid samples from patients with early ARDS (days 0-4) and identified a pattern of relative immune tolerance distinguishing ARDSderived alveolar macro phages from those of healthy controls. Although the contribution of alveolar macrophages in lung host defence, injury, and reso lution is established, 53 it would seem unwise to ignore the potential contributions of lungresident neutrophils and lymphocytes, as well as the endothelial, epithelial, and stromal cells of the lungs. Attempts to characterise gene expression in wholeblood or circulating mono nuclear cells have also been done for ARDS 54, 55 and have implicated dysregulation in neutrophilexpressed genes and the ferritin heavy chain, although these findings await replication.",

Additionally, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have improved the accuracy and sensitivity of the identification of unknown proteins and metabolites. 56 A high dimensional proteomic analysis 57 of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with ARDS identified differential protein expression between ARDS survivors and nonsurvivors over the first 4 days of ARDS, with nonsurvivors manifesting decreased expression of proteins related to coagulation, iron homoeostasis, and immune activation and increased expression of proteins related to glycolysis, collagen metabolism, and the actin cytoskeleton. Highthroughput proteomic screening of plasma from patients with ARDS identified increased expression of glyco proteins and serum amyloid A and decreased expression of complement factor H and apolipoprotein A, B, and C compared with plasma from healthy controls. 58 However, discovery proteomics in lung injury has been hampered by several factors, including the complexity of the plasma proteome and overwhelming signals from highabundance plasma proteins (eg, albumin), which have limited the insights gained to date; 59 thus, most of the recent advances in this area have come from candidate marker analyses.

The gastrointestinal tract, and not the upper respiratory tract, was shown to be the source of sepsisinduced lung microbiome alterations for mice with sepsis from systemic insults, whereas this shift from typical lungresident microbes to gutassociated bacteria was not observed in mice exposed to intratracheal lipopolysaccharide to model direct lung injury. 63 In support of these findings, 63 sequencing of bacterial ribosomal RNA from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 68 patients with ARDS identified gutassociated Bacteroides species in 28 (41%) patients, compared with only one (3%) of 26 healthy controls. Enrichment of gut bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was associated with the plasma concentration of inflammatory markers. Thus, for nonpulmonary sepsisassociated ARDS, translocation of bacteria from the gut to the lungs might have a more prominent role than previously recognised, because traditional culture methods are relatively insensitive to anaerobic bacteria. Whether this mech anism can be targeted to prevent or treat ARDS, however, remains untested.",

How should this wealth of biological data, often coupled with extensive clinical data from the critical care setting, be analysed to maximise our potential insight into novel treatment approaches for ARDS? Even for candidate marker analyses, novel analytical approaches might be needed to maximise the insight gained and integrate with complex molecular and clinical data. Traditionally, biological data from human beings with ARDS have been analysed in one of two ways: by identifying the biological phenotypes most strongly associated with a clinical outcome of interest (often death), with the idea that targeting these pathways might thereby reduce mortality, or by dividing patients into categories based on clinically evident or pre supposed characteristics and then comparing their clinical and biological phenotypes to identify distinct subgroups that might respond differently to treatment.",

This approach is appealingly straightforward; it is intuitive and, at least in its simplest form, requires minimal advanced training in statistical analysis for either the investigator or the reader of the final product. Moreover, this approach has led to substantial advances in our understanding of the biology of human ARDS. Over the past three decades, studies ranging from small, singlecentre investigations to secondary analyses of large multicentre clinical trials have reported associations between poor clinical outcomes and biomarkers of key pathways of lung injury-for example, injury to the lung epithelium and endothelium-as well as numerous inflammatory pathways. Although a comprehensive review of these studies is beyond the scope of this Review, several of the key studies are cited in table 1. This approach is particularly well suited to confirming the human relevance of biological pathways identified in laboratory models of ARDS. This approach has most commonly been used to analyse candidate plasma proteins and genetic polymorphisms, although more recent investi gations have focused on unbiased discovery methods such as DNA and RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and proteomics. This approach also has notable limitations. First and most important is the old adage that correlation does not imply causation; put differently, biological markers associated with mortality in ARDS might not be Review causal drivers of ARDS mortality and, therefore, might not be good therapeutic targets. Studying these associations in the setting of a randomised trial, and incorporating analysis of the response of the biomarker in question to the randomly assigned therapy, might partially mitigate but not eliminate this issue. 21 Second, the regressionbased models typically used for these types of analyses do not mandate or necessarily facilitate analyses of heterogeneity within ARDS, so as to identify treatmentresponsive subgroups. Alternative analytical approaches are better suited than regression methods for this particular question.",

Other similar types of analyses have subdivided ARDS into diffuse versus focal radio graphic changes, or into subgroups based on clinical risk factors (eg, trauma vs sepsis vs other).

            "text": "Clusterbased methods encompass various analytical techniques that share the broad goal of identifying groups (clusters) of observations with similar characteristics. These types of methods, such as hierarchical clustering and \u03bameans clustering, have commonly been applied to genomic data, with the aim to identify clusters of patients with similar gene expression patterns. Once biological data has been used to identify patient clusters, the clusters can subsequently be analysed for differences in clinical outcomes, clinical phenotypes, or other variables of interest. Multiple examples exist of the use of these techniques in asthma, in which they have helped to identify the Thelper2high endotype in several studies. 69, 70 In critical care, clusterbased methods have been used to identify subclasses of paediatric septic shock. 71, 72 These methods have several advantages, including an explicit focus on reducing heterogeneity by identifying subgroups that are internally similar, an unbiased approach free from presupposition, and facile visual representation (ie, the classic heat map). Another advantage for use of clustering in ARDS is that it can be done on baseline characteristics without consideration of outcome. However, one notable disadvantage of clusterbased methods is that they will always identify clusters 73 and do not test a specific hypothesis regarding the number of clusters in a particular class. This parameter must be set externally and, as such, might be prone to bias regarding the number of clusters present, although methods exist to estimate the optimal number of clusters from the data. 74 Another advanced analytical approach, which, similar to cluster analysis, often falls under the rubric of machine learning, is classification trees, often referred to as classification and regression tree analysis. This approach is designed to identify unexpected cutpoints in a set of data that permit classification into subgroups that might not be readily apparent. This approach generates a branching treelike structure that branches at specific cutpoints of a given variable and ends in multiple terminal nodes, which are often distinguished by differences in outcomes. This method has the advantage of being able to identify patterns in the data that would otherwise be unapparent. However, classification trees are also notorious for overfitting the model to the data and, as such, mandate external validation in independent datasets. Treebased models have been used in hospital inpatients to identify predictors of clinical deterioration, 75 in adult septic shock to refine prognostic stratification based on plasma biomarkers, 76 and in ARDS to identify clinical features associated with poor outcomes. 77 These trees are constructed based on the association between the measured variables and a specific clinical outcome, so the caveats regarding outcomebased models also apply to these trees-ie, that the variables which identify the branches in the tree might not be causally related to the observed differences in outcomes. Similar to cluster based models, treebased models also require external and potentially arbitrary decisions regarding the number of branches and terminal nodes, although methods with resampling and crossvalidation have been developed to inform these decisions. 75 Latent class analysis is an approach derived from mixture modelling that is explicitly designed to identify hidden (socalled latent) subgroups within a larger group. Latent class analysis has been widely applied in Review psychiatric research and has been an important contributor to the study of asthma endotypes. 78, 79 One major strength of latent class modelling is that it can test the hypothesis that a certain number of classes (k) fits the data better than one fewer class (k -1), providing more objective confirmation of the optimal number of classes for a given dataset. In ARDS, use of latent class analysis has identified two distinct subphenotypes in independent analyses of three randomised trials. 15, 17 The two sub phenotypes were clearly distinguished in part on the basis of biomarker profiles, with one sub phenotype characterised as hyperinflammatory com pared with the other subphenotype, and by their responses to randomly assigned positive endexpiratory pressure and a fluidconservative management strat egy. When applied to trauma cohorts, latent class analysis also identified distinct subgroups of ARDS that were distinguished largely by time to ARDS development, but also by clinical characteristics and plasma biomarker expression. 80 One disadvantage of latent class analysis is that relatively large datasets (n>300 individuals) are typically needed to confidently fit latent class models.",

            "text": "If we consider that every biological process is, to some degree, controlled by our DNA, the genetic regulation of a plasma protein such as ANG2 is far less complex than that of ARDS, because the phenotype of plasma ANG2 concentration is regulated by fewer genes and has a stronger correlation between genetic variation and measured output (ANG2) than does a disease phenotype such as ARDS. Thus, the likelihood of finding genetic variants that explain a high proportion of variance in plasma ANG2 concentration is greater than finding variants that explain a large proportion of ARDS risk. 50 Furthermore, quantitative traits are statistically more powerful than dichotomous traits, such that statistically significant results might be detected with only 100 or 200 patients, rather than with the 1000s necessitated by traditional genomewide association studies, 85 and such sample sizes are far more achievable for populations of critically ill patients. Genomics can then be used to apply causal inference methods-techniques borrowed from the econometric and social science fields-to infer causality from observational data. The advantage of identifying causal biomarkers in ARDS, rather than markers that merely correlate with ARDS, is that modifying the causal intermediate is more likely to influence disease outcome. Experimental evidence from animal or in vitro models allows us to directly test whether intermediates have direct causal effects; however, it would be unethical to randomly assign people to receive doses of a potentially injurious marker. Thus, methods to infer the effect of a potential mediator-for example, a plasma marker such as ANG2, a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid metabolite, or a whole blood transcript-on ARDS risk or mortality are desirable. Once a marker is suggested to have a causal role, rigorous experiments in model systems should be done to more definitively show causality.",

            "text": "Mediation analysis is a formal method to explain the mechanism by which a potential explanatory variable influences an outcome via an intermediate, or mediator variable. Many quantitative traits have a strong genetic component; thus, mediation analysis can be applied to associations between SNPs and disease outcomes to test whether a significant portion of the association is mediated by change in a third variable, the quantitative trait. 86 If the intermediate trait (biomarker, transcript, or metabolite) mediates a significant portion of the observed risk, this provides good evidence that the marker might be mechanistically linked to the disease outcome. Wei and colleagues 87 used mediation analysis to address whether changes in platelet count might explain ARDS risk and mortality. They first identified genetic variants that strongly influenced baseline platelet count during critical illness and then assessed whether a SNP strongly associated with platelet count was also associated with ARDS risk; they found that a small but significant portion of the association between a SNP and ARDS was mediated indirectly through changes in baseline platelet count. In a related analysis, 88 the same group used this method to show that a decrease in platelet count mediates a portion of ARDS mortality. The associations between genetic variants and a quantitative trait such as a plasma marker can also be harnessed for instrumental variable analysis, whereby SNPs that are strongly associated with a biomarker are used to genetically predict the biomarker, and then the association between the genetically predicted biomarker and the outcome is assessed. This approach is sometimes called a mendelian randomisation analysis, because each individual is considered randomised by random assort ment of parental alleles to a genotype that might express high or low levels of a biomarker. Mendelian randomisation studies have provided strong support for the causal contribution of LDLcholesterol to risk of Review coronary artery disease; genetic variants associated with the plasma concentration of LDLcholesterol were also associated with coronary artery disease, and when the concentration of LDLcholesterol was predicted by genotype, genetically predicted LDLcholesterol was associated with this disease. 89 Furthermore, dissecting the genetic determinants of LDLC concentration has uncovered novel treatment platforms for coronary artery disease, 89, 90 offering an attractive template for ARDS genetic research if appropriate intermediates can be identified.",

One solution to this scarcity of tissue is to use human lungs that were declined for transplantation. Up to 80% of evaluated lungs are deemed unsuitable for transplant because of poor oxygenation, visible injury, or poor compliance, features that are common to ARDS. 92, 93 Furthermore, to better simulate conditions in vivo, these human lungs can be ventilated and perfused in an exvivo lung perfusion (EVLP) system for several hours (figure 2), allowing the observation of physio logical measures such as compliance, alveolar fluid clearance, and oxygenation and the sampling of lung tissue, perfusate, and alveolar fluid. 94, 95 Clinical trials (eg, NCT01365429) 92 are being done to test whether EVLP can increase the number of suitable lungs for transplantation while maintaining optimal transplant outcomes. However, these sophisticated systems can also be optimal ARDS preclinical models in which to screen potential ARDS therapies, 94,95 because they have the advantages of safety (no human exposure) and access to human lung tissue. By taking biopsy samples of the tissue and using pharmacological inhibitors or agonists, the mechanism of a drug's action can be investigated. The EVLP system can also be adapted to model a uniform injury by applying bacteria or endotoxin to the lung, making this an adaptable model for hypothesistesting for ARDS prevention and therapy. 95 Another potential therapeutic screening method uses microfluidic bioengineering and threedimensional cell culture to produce a microengineered lungonachip, complete with an alveolar-capillary interface, cyclic stretch to mimic breathing, and perfusion to model circulation (figure 3). 91 Although this system relies on human cell lines that are capable of persisting in long term culture, and thus, to date, alveolar epithelial cells derived from a lung cancer cell line rather than primary human alveolar epithelial cells have been used, drug induced permeability pulmonary oedema was modelled with this system and was shown to share many features with clinical toxicity from interleukin 2, including reduced oxygen tension and endothelial and epithelial paracellular gap formation. 91, 96 Most impressively, that model could be used to test whether coadministration of preventive agents-for example, angiopoietin1 or a transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 channel inhibitor-could block the inter leukin 2mediated permeability and, via immuno histochemistry, the mechanism of action could be evaluated. 91 The microfluidic lungonachip could also be adapted to study therapeutic applications and might Review be considered a more highthroughput method for drug screening than EVLP because it does not rely on the scarce resource of human lungs. Additionally, if a quantitative trait such as a plasma protein concentration was identified as having causal significance through causal inference modalities or endotype identification, then drug screening could proceed with the secreted protein as an outcome, improving efficiency. Although promising compounds would still need to be tested in both small and large animal models of ARDS before proceeding to human trials, both EVLP and lungona chip microdevices might help to select agents most likely to benefit patients.",

To date, CRISPR/Cas9 editing has been used to make mice susceptible to the coronavirus responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome, overcoming the relative species restriction that Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus exhibits and allowing the testing of potential vaccine and antibody treatments. 98 Future uses of this technology in ARDS could be to interrogate the functional significance of poly morphisms or genes identified through genome wide association studies or transcriptomic screens, to provide or refute evidence for pathogenic causality for ARDS biomarkers, and to potentially allow testing of a precision paradigm whereby a targeted treatment could be tested in different genetic backgrounds.",

            "text": "In this age of rapid technological and analytical advances, the promise of matching patients to therapies most likely to help, and least likely to harm, seems more attainable than at any previous point in history. Numerous challenges remain, however, particularly in identifying new drug targets and selecting patients most likely to benefit. The approaches reviewed here have already identified plasma biomarkers that could serve as prognostic enrichment factors; markers that identify patients more likely to experience ARDS or who are at an increased risk of dying if ARDS is present. 15, 19 Enrichment strategies that select such high risk patients should improve power for clinical trials by ensuring a population with sufficient outcomes to analyse a potential treatment effect. If causal inference methods or preclinical models of ARDS suggest that a marker has a causal role in the development or progression of ARDS, then the marker might actually identify a biological endotype of ARDS. Endotype defining markers might be useful for predictive enrichment, whereby a plasma marker could inform about a patient's likely response to a specific therapy. 15, 17 As a direct extension, one could then imagine clinical trials for which eligibility might be predicated on the potential patient expressing a specific plasma marker. This approach has been shown to be highly successful in cancer therapy, especially when using tumour gene expression profiles to select targeted therapy. 99, 100 In asthma, endotype recognition has similarly stimulated new therapies that might be more successful when restricted to patients predicted to benefit. 101 To realise the potential of biomarkerdriven clinical trials for ARDS, however, a few things must happen. 102, 103 First, markers must be rapidly available for hospital inpatients to inform potential trial eligibility. By contrast with cancer, a biopsy is unlikely to be available for ARDS and patients and providers cannot afford to wait long for potential genetic results. The technology to measure protein biomarkers by ELISA in real time is not a technical barrier, but such assays are generally not commercially available. Microfluidic cell separation coupled with multiplexed, colourcoded probes might eventually allow rapid gene expression tests at the bedside; 104 however, this technology has not been widely applied to critical illness. 105 Second, biomarkerdriven trials would require more knowledge about the performance of potential plasma markers over time during the natural course of ARDS, because the concentration of many markers is highly variable by time. 82, 106 Third, in many cases, biomarkerdirected trials would ideally be preceded by testing of potential therapies in preclinical models of ARDS such as EVLP or lungon achip, in addition to animal models of ARDS, to better predict whether an endotypedefining marker denotes a pathway that is modified by the potential therapy. We acknowledge that, even when a precision paradigm for ARDS is well supported by consistent findings across endotype identification, genomic or proteomic profiling, and even experimental designs such as EVLP, a potential therapy might not improve mortality if it has a deleterious effect on a comorbid condition during critical illness or if it has utility for ARDS prevention but not progression, particularly if ARDS develops rapidly. Well designed studies will be needed to selectively target ARDS prevention and therapy. Clinical trial considerations are addressed more comprehensively in a related review about this issue. 107 In summary, precision medicine is a realistic paradigm for ARDS that could begin to be tested in the near future. As 'omic methods, novel models of lung injury, and new analytical approaches improve the resolution of ARDS endotypes and suggest new mechanisms of treatment, pharmacological breakthroughs might be closer than we realise.",
