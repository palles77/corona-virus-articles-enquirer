Upon arrival, travellers may be asymptomatic, either in the incubation period or have a subclinical infection, have mild symptoms, use antipyretics to reduce fever, or may not report their symptoms. Because cases may be missed, entry screening has been described as ineffective and resource-intensive (13, (20) (21) (22) . However, the efficacy of border screening is difficult to evaluate (23) . One study has shown that entry screening may delay local transmission of a novel influenza strain by one to two weeks, time which could be used for further community preparation for an epidemic (21) . In addition, visible border screening and control may increase public confidence, awareness and compliance. While entry screening of travellers at borders has limitations, it is only one piece of PHAC's strategy to minimize the importation of communicable diseases into Canada.",

Many of the public health measures taken at points of entry are conducted under the umbrella of the IHR (2005), an international treaty that Canada has signed (18). The purpose of the IHR (2005) is to prevent, protect against, control and respond to the international spread of disease while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. Under the IHR (2005), Canada is obligated to take health measures at points of entry in order to limit the spread of public health risks. To determine whether Canada met IHR (2005) requirements at points of entry, the capacity to detect and respond to public health risks (including infectious diseases) was assessed at five points of entry. These points of entry were selected based on volume of travellers and geographic representation and included the Vancouver International Airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport, Montr\u00e9al-Trudeau International Airport, Metro Vancouver Cruise Ship Terminal and the Halifax Cruise Ship Terminal. These points of entry met WHO requirements and are therefore considered designated points of entry under the IHR (2005)",
