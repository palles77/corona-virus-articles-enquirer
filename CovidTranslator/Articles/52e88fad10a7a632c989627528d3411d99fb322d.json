Because of the vital role that these S proteins play, they represent a vulnerable target for the development of therapeutics to combat these highly pathogenic coronaviruses.",

These VHHs are capable of potently neutralizing MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses. The crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs block receptor binding. We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S, and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH is capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion. These data provide a molecular basis for the neutralization of pathogenic betacoronaviruses by VHHs and suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutics during coronavirus outbreaks.",

            "text": "Recent advances in cryo-EM have allowed researchers to determine high-resolution 25 structures of the trimeric spike protein ectodomains and understand how S functions as a 26 macromolecular machine (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Li et al., 2005; Walls et al., 2016; Wang et 27 al., 2013) . Initial cryo-EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-1 spike revealed that the RBDs 28 adopted at least two distinct conformations. In the \"up\" conformation, the RBDs could be 29 observed jutting out away from the rest of S, such that they could easily engage ACE2 without 30 causing any steric clashes. In the \"down\" conformation, the RBDs were tightly packed against 31 the top of the S2 subunit, preventing binding by ACE2 (Gui et al., 2017) . Subsequent 32 experiments have corroborated this phenomenon and similar dynamics have been observed in 33 MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S and in alphacoronavirus S proteins (Jones et al., 2019; 34 Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Walls, 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 35 2017) . Due to the relatively low abundance of particles that can be observed by cryo-EM with 36 three RBDs in the up conformation, it is thought that this conformation may correspond to an 37 energetically unstable state (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017) . These observations 38 led to the hypothesis that the CoV RBDs may be acting as molecular ratchets, wherein a 39 receptor-binding event would trap the RBD in the less stable up conformation, leading to gradual 40 destabilization until S is finally triggered to initiate membrane fusion. Recent experiments 41 characterizing RBD-directed anti-SARS-CoV-1 antibodies that trap the SARS-CoV-1 RBD in 42 the up conformation and lead to destabilization of the prefusion spike have lent support to this 43 hypothesis (Walls et al., 2019) . 44",

This interface does not, however, overlap with the ACE2 binding interface. Rather, ACE2 170 would clash with the CDR-distal framework of SARS VHH-72 ( Figure 3B ). This clash would 171 only be enhanced by the presence of an N-linked glycan at Asn322 of ACE2, which is already 172 located within the VHH framework when the receptor-bound RBD is aligned to the VHH-bound 173 RBD ( Figure 3C) . 174 SARS VHH-72 binds to the SARS-CoV-1 RBD by forming an extensive hydrogen-bond 175 network via its CDRs 2 and 3 (Figure3D-E).

When the MERS-CoV RBDs are all in the down conformation or all in the up 217 conformation, MERS VHH-55 would be able to bind all three of the protomers making up the 218 functional spike trimer without forming any clashes. However, if a down protomer was bound by 219 MERS VHH-55 and the neighboring protomer sampled the up conformation, this RBD would 220 then be trapped in this state by the presence of the neighboring MERS VHH-55 molecule 221 (Figure 5A). This conformational trapping would be even more pronounced upon SARS VHH-222 72 binding to the full-length SARS-CoV-1 S protein or the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein. 223 Due to the binding angle of SARS VHH-72, when a bound SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBD 224 samples the down conformation, it would form dramatic clashes with the S2 fusion subunit, 225regardless of the conformations of the neighboring RBDs(Figure 5B-C).

The possibility of administering these molecules via a nebulized spray is particularly 304 attractive in the case of respiratory pathogens because the VHHs could theoretically be inhaled 305 directly to the site of infection in an effort to maximize bioavailability and function (LariosMora  306   et al., 2018). Due to the current lack of treatments for MERS, SARS and COVID-19 and the 307 devastating effects associated with pandemic coronavirus outbreaks, both prophylactic and 308 therapeutic interventions are sorely needed. It is our hope that due to their favorable biophysical 309 properties and their potent neutralization capacity, MERS VHH-55, SARS VHH-72 and VHH-310 72-Fc may serve as both useful reagents for researchers and as potential therapeutic candidates. 311ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 312We thank members of the McLellan Laboratory for providing helpful comments on the 313 manuscript.

The 365 wells were then washed 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.05% Tween 20 and 366 blocked with SEA BLOCK blocking buffer (Thermo Scientific) in the first panning round and 5% 367 milk powder in PBS in the second panning round. About 10 11 phages were added to the coated 368 well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Non-specifically bound phages were removed 369 by washing with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (10 times in the first panning round and 15 times in the 370 second panning round). The retained phages were eluted with TEA-solution (14% trimethylamine 371 (Sigma) pH 10) and subsequently neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8. The collected phages were 372 amplified in exponentially growing E.coli TG1 cells, infected with VCS M13 helper phages and 373 subsequently purified using PEG 8,000/NaCl precipitation for the next round of selection. 374Enrichment after each panning round was determined by infecting TG1 cells with 10-fold serial 375 dilutions of the collected phages after which the bacteria were plated on LB agar plates with 376 100 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ampicillin and 1% glucose.377 Phages displaying SARS-CoV-1 directed VHHs were enriched after 2 rounds of 378 biopanning on 20 \u03bcg of SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein captured with an anti-foldon antibody 379 (generously provided by Dr. Vicente Mas) in one well of a microtiter plate (type II, F96 Maxisorp, 380 Nuc).

The individual colonies were inoculated in 2 mL of terrific broth (TB) 390 medium with 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin in 24-well deep well plates. After growing individual colonies 391 for 5 hours at 37 \u00b0C, isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1 mM) was added to induce 392 VHH expression during overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C.
