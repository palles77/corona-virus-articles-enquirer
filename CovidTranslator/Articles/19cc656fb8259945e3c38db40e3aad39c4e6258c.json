According to prevailing concepts, the main function of N-glycosidic oligosaecharides is to stabilize the polypeptide conformation and the loss of infectivity is caused only indirectly by the absence of oligosaccharides due to such secondary events as increased sensitivity to intracellutar proteolytic degradation or unspecific aggregation of underglycosylated viral glycoproteins (4) .",

Most likely the oligosaceharide constituent of tt~e HPA-binding HSV glyeoprotein is linked to the peptide via an 0-glycosidic bond between N-aeetylgalaetosamine (GalNAc) and a serine or threonine of the peptide (19, 20) . Such O-glycosidic linkages of HSV (19) , vaecinia (26) and coronavirus (7, 15) glycoproteins have been described recently. It is tempting to compare the HPA-binding I-ISV gtycoproteins with several biologically highly active glyeoeonjugates such as blood group substances and lymphocyte differentiation antigens which also demonstrate HPA-binding activities (8, 1i) . For these types of antigens it is likely that the carbohydrate itself mediates the biological activity, a phenomenon which contrasts to the less specific biological significance of N-glycosidic oligosaceharides. Recently, the function of so called stage-specific differentiation antigens have been blocked by addition of competing carbohydrate haptens (5) . Thus, the HPA-binding oligosaccharides of HSV glyeoproteins might constitute a carbohydrate structure with a more defined biological significance, probably as a recognition structure. In the present study the distribution of I-IPA-binding activity among I.ISV glyeoproteins was investigated, and it was found that only a subfraetion of gC contains HPA-binding oligosaccharides while the other fra.etion contains 0-glycosidic oligosaeeharide without affinity for ItPA.",

Immunosorbent purified gC was therefore fractionated by HPA affinity chromatography and the subfraction not binding to HPA subsequently subjected to treatment with alkaline NaBH4.

This diversity m a y be caused either solely by host cell glyeosyl transferases or by one or more virus specified or virus modified enzymes acting in concert with the cell specified glycosyl transferases. We have previously pointed out the changes of kinetic properties of glyeosyl transferases after HSV infection of cells (21) . Presence of competing glycosyl transferases leading to biosynthetic branching of a core structure into different types of otigosaccharides with and without blood group A activity has been demonstrated with 0-1inked carbohydrates of the sheep submaxillary mucin (24) .",

In fact gC was the only glycoprotein transported to and inserted into the plasmamembrane in significant amounts in presence of TM. The gC exposed on the cell surface lacked reactivity in the antibodydependent cell-mediated c)~otoxicity test a finding which suggests that presence of N-glycosidic oligosaccharides were essential for the ADCC reaction (16) . On the other hand the presence of 0-1inked carbohydrates seems sufficient for transport of glycoprotcins to the plasmamembrane and different functions of the two classes of oligosaccharidcs on the ItSV glycoprotcin gC might thus be discerneable.",
