In the early 1970s, Kapikian focused on this approach to the search for the elusive viruses believed to be responsible for nonbacterial gastroenteritis. It was not long before he identified the virions of the so-called Norwalk agent in a diarrheal stool from an adult volunteer who had been challenged with a fecal sample from a child ill during an outbreak of diarrhea. This virus and its soon-to-be-discovered close relatives (the so-called Norwalk-like viruses [NLVs]) proved to be important causes of explosive outbreaks of diarrhea in both children and adults.",

These agents proved to be the prototype for a new genus, the rotaviruses (RVs), members of which are infectious for humans and a wide variety of domestic animals. Rotaviruses, classified into Group A, are now recognized to be the major cause of severe diarrheal disease in infants and young children worldwide.",

            "text": "With the discovery of the enteroviruses (see Chapter 1) and the demonstration of their chronic presence in the stools of many of those who are infected, it was thought that the search for the cause of nonbacterial diarrhea would soon be over. But despite the presence of high concentrations of enteroviruses in the stools of both ill and healthy children, it shortly became apparent that these viruses were not common etiologic agents of enteritis, but merely nonpathogenic \"passengers'' in our digestive tracts. Other viruses such as members of many of the common serotypes of the adenoviruses similarly can often be found in the gut, but they too usually fail to cause disease. As an outgrowth of an enormous amount of laboratory work, it was ultimately concluded that the elusive viruses of childhood enteritis are sufficiently fastidious that they cannot be easily grown in tissue culture and in laboratory animals. Thus, in the early 1970s, investigators initiated attempts to identify viral particles in stool extracts using electron microscopy. To accomplish this, the background was stained (so-called negative staining), with the virions in startling contrast, that is, like stars in a dark sky. Should the virions be present in sufficient number, and should their morphology be sufficiently distinctive, infection could be established. By adding specific antibody (or serum from a previously infected patient) to the suspension, the virions would clump with the antibody and an antigenic identification of the virus accomplished. This also proved a means for assaying the relative concentration of antibody in the blood of those who were infected. The technique of negative-staining electron microscopy using clinical enteric specimens is an arduous art form that requires exceptional skill and attention to detail, clearly not a characteristic of many of our species. But, this painstaking approach has now yielded evidence to indicate that viruses of at least six families may contribute to enteric illness in children and in adult citizens whose immunity has waned (Figure 32.1, Table 32 .1). Studies in domestic animals have also shown that diarrheal disease of economic importance is caused by members of these same virus families, possibly by strains of virus that are host-specific. With the development of refined rnolecular and immunological tools, more sensitive and less laborious diagnostic approaches fortunately are now replacing negative-staining electron microscopy of stool specimens.

The etiological role of these viruses as a cause of intestinal disease was established by demonstrating a temporal association of naturally occurring infections (as demonstrated by stool examination using electron microscopy) with illness and by experimental induction of disease in both human volunteers and experimental animals (Hall et al, 1984) . The NLVs are provisionally divided for classification purposes into two distinct groups based on genetic analysis (Table  32 .2). The relative clinical importance of the viruses of the various groups listed in Table 32. 2 has yet to be established, but they are believed to be responsible for a substantial proportion of the nonbacterial outbreaks of acute vomiting and diarrhea that occur in families and institutions. Although survey information is incomplete, infections with NLV are thought to occur worldwide. In developing countries, the majority of children are infected during the first 10 years of life ( Figure 32 .2), whereas in North America infection is relatively uncommon in children, and by the fifth decade of life only 50% of the population possess serological evidence of past infection. It is not clear what proportion of these infections are accompanied by clinical illness, and we possess only limited information on the persistence of serum antibodies during convalescence from infection. Thus, NLV-related disease may occur more commonly than serological surveys of the population now suggest.",

Yet, because symptoms usually are m^ercifuUy short-lived (24 to 48 hr), the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is rarely a problem in otherwise healthy infants (Table 32 .4). In developing countries, however, the threat to life is more imposing, particularly since infections so frequently occur among the very young. Illness in adults is less severe (Table 32 .5), if it occurs at all. Indeed, 60 to 80% of infections in adults are asymptomatic. This may reflect age-related resistance (as documented in animals) (Ciarlet et al, 1998) or the acquisition of a spectrum of serotype-specific IgA antibodies in the gut resulting from previous natural infection. As the years pass, immunity may wane among the elderly, in part due to less frequent encounters with the virus in their home setting. Older folks more often develop severe diarrheal illnesses when infected with RVs, and deaths are reported (Hrdy 1987) .",

In calves, the lesions tended to be more prominent in the proximal small intestine, whereas in lambs the distal ileum was more severely affected.

In general, the sites of RV replication correlate with the pathological changes found in the intestinal mucosa (Snodgrass et al, 1977) .

At present, relatively few clinical studies have addressed these issues in detail. Involvement of the upper intestinal tract (duodenum and jejunum) may account for the vomiting that so frequently occurs in NLV infections. Diarrheal disease no doubt is consequent to the profound changes in the intestinal mucosa that occur during the acute illness. Reduction in the surface area of the gut mucosa and functional alterations in the individual enterocytes that line villi reduce absorption of fluids and solids beyond the capacity of the colon to compensate. The loss of disaccharidases in the mucosal cells of the small intestine increases the carbohydrate concentrations of the large bowel content, resulting in the generation of fermentation products.",
