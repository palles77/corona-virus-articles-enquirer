These include C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) localized to the cell surface or within endosomes and intracellular retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide oligomerization and binding domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and the Pyrin-HIN domain (PYHIN) receptors (5, 7, 8) . Each of these receptor types has multiple members, and individual members of a receptor type variously recognize pathogen-associated products or damage-associated molecular patterns, such as reactive oxygen species, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), or apoptotic/necrotic cells (9) .",

By contrast, the extent of the contribution of NLRs in the recognition of virus and virus-infected cells has only been appreciated more recently (10) . NLRs are a large receptor family including at least 20 members. NLRs play a dominant role in inflammasome activation resulting in the Caspase-1-dependent maturation and release from cells of the proinflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18. However, not all NLRs are proinflammatory. Engagement of certain members of this receptor family can downregulate pro-inflammatory signals generated by other PRR types (11) . In addition, several NLRs have been reported to regulate antigen presentation events associated with the MHC class I and II presentation pathways (12, 13) . In their review of the role of NLRs in antiviral immunity, Lupfer and Kanneganti (14) examine the role of specific NLRs in inflammasome activation and regulation during virus infection and the contribution of other NLRs to the regulation of inflammation and viral antigen presentation during virus infection.",

Type I IFNs were initially identified and named based on their antiviral properties. However, in addition to upregulating genes that inhibit virus replication, this class of cytokines has been appreciated to play an important role in orchestrating the adaptive immune response to virus infection. Recently, a new family of antiviral cytokines, the type III IFN family, has been identified. The type III IFNs (also known as IFN 1, 2, 3 or IL-29, IL-28A, IL-28B, respectively) appeared to activate the same antiviral pathways and transcriptional factors, e.g. IFNstimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), as the type I IFNs. However, the type III IFNs have little structural homology with their type I counterparts and engage a distinct heterodimeric receptor, which includes the IL-10R2 chain (15) . In their article, Durbin and coworkers (16) summarize the current understanding of antiviral signaling by type I and type III IFNs, with particular emphasis on the induction of these cytokines and the expression of antiviral activity of these two cytokine families at mucosal surfaces, notably the respiratory tract and gut following infection with influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or rotavirus (RV). They also summarize our current understanding of the immunomodulatory effects of these cytokines on the induction of the adaptive immune response through their effect on specific cell types, for example natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DCs) (17) , and the distinct signal transduction events associated with immune modulation by IFN.",

In their review on the impact of autophagy on CD8 + T-cell-mediated antiviral immunity, Perot and colleagues (20) review the complex interplay between viruses and three pathways of response to virus infection, that is autophagy, the innate immune response, and the adaptive immune response. In this article, the authors describe the subcellular constituents making up the autophagy response and strategies that viruses employ to either enhance or inhibit autophagy and the consequences of alterations in autophagy on innate and adaptive immune response induction. Of particular note is the recent evidence on the contribution of autophagy to viral antigen processing and presentation to CD8 + T cells. They further extend this analysis to evaluate the impact of autophagy on T-cell differentiation in the thymus in the process of lymphocyte activation in the periphery.",

This report examines the consequences of direct activation of DCs by virus infection as well as indirect or trans activation of DCs by products released by airway epithelial cells, themselves responding to engagement of their PRRs by virus or cellular stress. For example, IL-1 produced by respiratory epithelial cells following PRR engagement acts in an autocrine fashion to release DC-attracting chemokines as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to support DC recruitment and viability and factors involved in epithelial regeneration (IL-33). DC migration from the lungs to the draining lymph nodes is an essential step in the initiation of the antiviral T-cell response. Type I IFNs are the most potent inducers of DC maturation resulting in DC migration (22) . This report also reviews current findings on the role of individual DC subsets in orchestrating different aspects of the adaptive immune response, including the dominant role of the CD8a/CD 103 + DC family in cross-presenting viral pathogen to naive CD8 + T cells and the role of C-type lectins (most notably DNGR-1) in capturing viral antigen delivered by dying epithelial cells (23) . This report points to the 'division of labor' among DC subsets in the induction of antiviral effector responses and in the control of local inflammation at the site of infection, i.e. the respiratory tract.",

The article concludes with evidence suggesting that repertoire diversity and broadly cross-reactive polyreactive B-cell responses, as exhibited by B-1 and extrafollicular B-2 responses, may be more important than B-cell affinity maturation (in the germinal center) for effective B-cell immunity to pathogens like IAV, which can undergo rapid antigenic variation.",

However as the aforementioned description of B-1 B cells and polyreactive natural antibodies suggest, this apparent high degree of specificity was not always observed. In the case of T lymphocytes, there were multiple early examples of T-cell cross-reactivity for apparently unrelated antigens (30) . Perhaps this was best exemplified from the early studies of Welsh and coworkers (31, 32) demonstrating cross-reactive recognition of heterologous viruses by memory CD8 + T cells. Su and Davis (33) review the topic of T-cell receptor (TCR) cross-reactivity in the development of CD4 + memory T-cell responses in both the mouse and human. This detailed review covers topics ranging from the pre-immune T-cell repertoire and the structural basis of T-cell cross-reactivity for seemingly unrelated viruses to the functional consequences of TCR cross-reactivity and the contribution of the microbiome to regulating the T-cell repertoire and TCR cross-reactivity on the development on human disease and responsiveness to vaccination. (34) continue with the theme of the consequences of TCR engagement of peptide/MHC (pMHC) complexes with specific emphasis on the formation and in vivo significance of immunological synapse formation. They review the evidence for and against the need for the formation of a stable mature immunological synapse to transduce signaling events and to express effector activity in activated CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells. They employ intravital two-photon laser scanning microscopy (35) to obtain real-time information on the interaction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte TCRs with pMHC displayed on infected cells in the model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis infection in the central nervous system. Their most recent evidence suggests that effective interactions between T cells and virus-infected cell targets, resulting in virus clearance or in some instances immune-mediated injury, can be either stable (with mature immunological synapse formation) or transient [with 'kinaspe' formation (36) ] depending on the target cell type and the extent of pMHC formation.",

Wortzman and co-authors (37) review the role of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members in antiviral immunity, emphasizing five TNFR members that primarily serve a prosurvival role in antiviral CD8 + T cells but can in some instances limit the antiviral T-cell response, i.e. exhibit co-inhibitory activity when the receptor is engaged.

For more than a decade, memory T cells were subdivided into T-effector memory (Tem) and T central memory (Tcm) cells. Tem cells primarily circulate through nonlymphoid tissues, while Tcm circulate through and home to secondary lymphoid organs. More recently, analyses have identified a third memory T-cell subset, the T tissue-resident memory (Trm) cells (39) . Trm cells primarily localize to and are retained in peripheral tissues. The localization and retention at these sites require expression of specific chemoattractant and homing receptors. Shin and Iwasaki (40) categorize peripheral tissues based on the accessibility of these tissues in the resting or inflamed state to effector T cells or the several subsets of memory T cells. They review the mechanisms regulating the migration of memory T cells in the steady state and in response to inflammation in particular virus infections. They describe the factors that control the generation of Trm cells and the properties that distinguish Trm from the Tcm and Tem cell subsets. Finally, they explore the potential role of Trm cells in vaccination against pathogens that invade the body through peripheral tissues.",

Veiga-Parga and co-authors (41) focus on the CD4 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing the transcription factor forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) and the contribution of this regulatory T-cell subset to antiviral immunity. They describe the mechanisms by which viruses induce responses from natural (thymus-derived) Tregs as well as inducible Tregs, which are derived from naive virus-specific primary CD4 + T cells. They discuss the instances where Tregs limit antiviral T-cell responses or control excess immune-mediated inflammation. They explore in detail the potential role of Tregs in chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV and the potential therapeutic possibilities of harnessing Treg responses to manage the outcome of virus infection, particularly in the context of chronic inflammation and injury associated with persistent virus infection.",

Data obtained from this molecular profiling can be used to formulate hypotheses for traditional research analyses.

Studies such as these have begun to reunite the fields of vaccinology and basic immunology.

Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature myeloid lineage cells that were initially detected in the circulation and in the microenvironment of human tumors. At least two 'subsets' of MDSCs have been identified displaying properties of either immature granulocytes or immature monocyte/macrophage lineage cells. As their name suggests, they are potent suppressors of antitumor immune responses. In recent years, evidence has emerged that MDSCs may play a role in immune evasion by viruses, particularly viruses that can produce persistent infection. In their review, Goh et al. (44) discuss the mechanisms involved in the generation and accumulation and survival of MDSCs during virus infection and the critical targets of MDSC action including T cells, NK cells, and antigen-presenting cells. They go on to catalog the list of viral infections in which the activity of MDSCs has been reported and then explore MDSCs as targets for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of chronic virus infections.",
