The continuing appearance of new IBV variants is associated with the high rate of evolution, expressed as the accelerated rate at which viable mutations accumulate in the genome, which is due to a lack of proofreading enzymes seen in RNA viruses, nucleotide insertions, deletions, or point mutations in S1 as the result of the viral polymerase [15, 16] , as well as the high rate of replication of the virus.

Several statistical approaches were utilized in the analysis; including the Jukes and Cantor method [22] to estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions assuming equal frequencies of the nucleotides and accounting for the fact that more than one substitution can happen at one site, the Nei-Gojobory calculation to estimate the synonymous changes (nucleotide changes not leading to aa changes) and the number of non-synonymous changes (nucleotide changes leading to aa changes), a z-test for Darwinian selection to identify sequences favoring changes in aa sequence, a z-test for purifying selection to identify nucleotide changes not causing a change in the resulting aa sequence, and the Poisson correction distance to compare sequences on the aa level accounting for the fact that multiple substitutions can occur at one site.",

Group 2 contained variants with > 80% sequence similarity to the original IBV California variant submitted to GenBank, CA 85-633 (GB# AF004738) and 1013 (GB# AF027508), and included most of the more recent IBV variants and an isolate also first identified in 1988 (prototype CA/1215/88). Computer analyses of nucleic acid and amino acid sequences were performed using the MacDNASIS Pro version 3.5 (Hitachi) and Sequencher 3.0 (Gene Codes Corp.) programs. Aligned sequences were cropped to a length of 426 bp (starting at 135 bp; numbering is based on the Mass41 S1 protein sequence (GB# M21883) [25] ) to insure a consistent fragment analyzed within the genome segment sequenced. Two sequences (CA/96/01 and CA/627/01) were both included in the analysis despite an identical 426 bp sequence, because they showed distinct differences within the cropped portion of their sequences. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the computer program Clustal W version 1.7 [40] . Molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using computer program MEGA TM version 2.1 [29] . All evolutionary calculations were performed using the complete deletion option, due to sites involved in gaps that may evolve differently in different sequences. The sequence of CA/1215/88 was used as the prototype in this study because it was believed to be the first isolate identified as a California variant [2, 14] of IBV within the sampling period and also not showing the \u2265 6 bp deletion. Nucleotide mutations were calculated by dividing the number of nucleotide differences by the number of years between the isolation of the prototype CA/1215/88 and the individual variant noting that counted mutations/year is a non-linear relationship with time as some mutation sites may undergo repeated substitutions and mutation rate would be underestimated. The number of nucleotide substitutions was also estimated using the Jukes and Cantor method, which corrects for multiple substitutions at the same site [\u22123/4ln(1\u22124/3p), where p = proportion of sites with different nucleotides] [22] . The R-ratio of nucleotide substitution was defined as the number of transitions (a substitution of a purine for another purine, or a substitution of a pyrimidine for another pyrimidine) to the number of transversions (substitutions between pyrimidines and purines).",

After counting the number of differences (S d , N d ), these counts were adjusted by the number of potential synonymous/non-synonymous sites (p-distance; p S , p N ), and p-distances then were corrected by the Jukes Cantor method to account for multiple substitutions at the same site (d S , d N ).

This study documents different evolutionary patterns of IBV depending on the production type of chicken (layer versus broiler). The fact that 88% of all significant, directed evolutionary changes such as the conservation of aa as measured by purifying selection, and positive selection measured by a change of the aa, was found in variants isolated from layer-type birds suggests that IBV variants isolated from layer chickens show a higher potential and/or evolutionary need to respond to external pressures, whereas a higher number of mutations/year on the nucleotide level without subsequent amino acid changes were seen in IBV variants isolated from broilers. Mutations on the nucleotide level occur in IBV in poultry constantly, but the life expectancy of the two different production types is probably responsible for the different outcomes. In broilers, with an average life expectancy of only 6 weeks, there is not sufficient pressure placed on the virus to avoid immune surveillance. Therefore the mutations on the nucleotide level observed are most likely due to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses in general [15, 16] combined with limited transmission opportunity over the relatively short lifespan of the bird or flock. On the other hand, layers could be subject during their more than one year life span [11] to several IBV infections in addition to routinely administered IBV-vaccines, resulting in selective immune pressures toward evolutionary change expressed in aa changes and positive predictive antigenicity. Though the association between evolutionary conservation of aa in the sequenced S1 gene fragment and the production type of the chicken was not statistically significant in our analysis, the findings may be different with a larger sample size.",

These specialty birds are used as breeders and layers as well as for meat production, and therefore do not represent typical genetics or management practices seen in broilers or layers. The different genetic makeup, the multipurpose production type, and the different management type, including extended life span of this breed might explain why variants isolated from these birds were more closely linked to the IBV variants associated with layer-type birds. Interestingly those two variants form a possible independent branch in the unrooted tree, if tree reconstruction is based only on aa sequences in the HVRs (data not shown).

            "text": "Subgrouping of IBV variants using the phylogenetic tree is not necessarily consistent with GenBank grouping. The difference between the two methods is due to the small number of nucleotides per variant that the GenBank match was based on. Wang et al. showed that phylogenetic grouping of only the S1 HVR amino acid sequences provides similar results to those obtained from sequencing the entire S1 genome [41] . However, trends toward mutations or conservation of specific aa patterns found in HVRs cannot be generalized for the entire S1 gene based on our study, showing that even though HVRs are thought to function as the center of diversity, mutations in more stable parts of the sequence were also detected. Additionally, the ratio of aa changes to silent mutations and the significance of the hypothesis testing for aa changes was different for HVRs compared to the larger S1 sequence, suggesting that HVR2 is predisposed to alterations in the aa pattern compared to HVR1. We can speculate that the neutralizing epitopes associated with HVR2 might be more important for making the first virus contact with the epithelial cells in affected poultry. Predictive antigenicity in HVR2, found only in variants isolated from layer type chickens, was also significantly linked to an overall number of less than 7 mutations per year, not having a \u2265 6 bp deletion, and being located within the Subgroup A of the phylogenetic tree. These characteristics all distinguish sequences according to the production type of bird. This result also seems to emphasize the selective pressure on IBV isolates from layer-type chickens toward change. However, we did not find any significant associations between predisposition to altered aa in HVRs or in the entire sequenced area, and predictive antigenicity. We explain the missing association with the possibility that some antigenic determinants might not be correlated with hydrophilicity and would not be assessed with a predictive antigenicity evaluation based on the principle of the greatest local hydrophilicity [18] . The non-significant association between predisposition to altered aa and predictive antigenicity, and especially the fact that CA/516A/98 does not show a positive predictive antigenicity value despite a predisposition toward altered aa in HVR2, might be examples of evolution without increasing hydrophilicity. Further immunologic studies, including field trials are needed to confirm predicted antigenicity, and to evaluate the impact of changes in HVR1 and HVR2 on the three-dimensional structure of epitopes. Though the population of variants studied was too small to statistically evaluate clinical disease association (data not shown), there is an interesting trend toward increased severity of disease that deserves further evaluation.",

An observed high mean nucleotide number of 8 mutations/year in concert with the fact that only one variant tested positive for an altered aa pattern seems to be unusual for a genomic sequence including two HVRs. It would be expected, that a high number of nucleotide mutations per year does conform to higher predisposition to altered aa in the group 1 variants, which are predominantly from broiler type birds. Additionally, the AT richness in the 3 rd codon position can increase the apparent rate of non-synonymous substitution [20] and would favor a predisposition to altered aa, meaning that among the IBV isolates evaluated, fewer than five mutants might show true predisposition to altered aa. In the population studied, a period of slow evolution despite a rapid replication of the virus and a high mutation frequency was observed. Eigen et al. [10] explained this phenomenon by demonstrating that in constant environments selection for fit of the master sequence occurs. Such periods of relative stasis do not imply that the viruses are incapable of rapid evolution under different circumstances [17] . High numbers of nucleotide mutations per year that do not result in altered aa, as seen in IBV variants from broilers, suggest a neutral polymorphism [26] . Cavanagh et al., reported a low mutation rate (10 \u22124 /year) at the nucleotide level in British and French IBV isolates collected from both production types [6] , and associated the low mutation rate with a small immune pressure on the S1 protein to change. Our results demonstrate different findings depending on the production type of the chicken, with layer birds having evidence of more immune pressure to change.",

Though unexpected, our results are consistent with unpublished observations (J. Gelb, personal communication, 2002) . Most of the observed changes in the motif are radical changes [19] , increasing the polarity and/or the hydrophobicity of the sequence. Those changes might suggest an adaptation allowing improved, membrane fusion and attachment functions as well as increased ability to avoid neutralization [35] . The observation also allows the speculation that the CK4 primer does not detect all IBV variants.",

In fact, 2 sequences eliminated from this study that were very similar on the nucleotide level appeared to have had frame shift mutations, because no plausible protein-reading frame could be designated. It is also possible that other sequences might have multiple frame shift mutations that would not result in a stop codon, sequence mutations that occurred during passage of the virus in the laboratory [15] , or due to errors in the techniques [28] . An imperfection in the current study that should be corrected in future work is the addition of a housekeeping gene as an assay control.Additionally an unknown variable resulting from the choice of convenience sampling is the unknown time period flocks or the representative sentinel chickens were infected with the particular variants prior to isolation.",
