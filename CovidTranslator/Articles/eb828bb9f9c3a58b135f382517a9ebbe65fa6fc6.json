In emergency departments or intensive care units, POCTs are used to find test results immediately to help guide life-saving decisions.",

            "text": "In resource-limited settings, access to healthcare facilities is typically limited. In such settings, POCTs are beneficial in terms of their ease of use independent from the physical presence of a laboratory. 5 In primary care settings, POCTs are typically used to prevent unnecessary referrals to specialised or secondary care, to guide diagnostic and treatment decisions, and to provide reassurance to patients, for example by excluding an illness. The rapid analysis can also lead to improved clinical performance, since it eliminates the potentially long intervals between the patient's initial examination and the discussion of the test results. 4 The first major systematic review of POCTs in primary care was published more than 20 years ago by Hobbs et al, 6 who concluded that evidence in support of the general introduction of POCTs in general practice was low. Since then, the POC diagnostic market has grown substantially and continues to do so because of the increasing development of new (supporting) technologies such as novel biomarkers, wireless connectivity, nanoparticle techniques and information sharing capabilities. 7 It is expected that the global POC diagnostics market will reach $40.50 billion by 2022. 8 Despite this growing market, primary care clinicians generally are hesitant to implement POCTs in their practice. According to a study on POC blood tests by Jones et al, 9 this is mainly because of concerns about accuracy, over-reliance on tests and limited usefulness.",

            "text": "was a clear inconsistency between what is reported on in the identified evaluations and what GPs consider important. Certain determinants of the published list used in this review are not relevant to a POCT, but rather to the disease prevalence and the GP and his practice (frequency of use, room for innovation, risks).These determinants were, as expected, underreported. None of the evaluations addressed any aspect related to room for innovation, whereas only one evaluation assessed the risk aspect of the test. Frequency of use was addressed in five of the test evaluations. Reimbursement (n = 2) and legislations (n = 3) were also rarely reported on in the evaluations. This could be since the impact of these determinants will vary between countries and were therefore purposefully excluded from the evaluations. The most relevant inconsistency was with clinical utility. Although GPs perceive clinical utility as the most important aspect when it comes to POCT, it was rarely explicitly included in the test evaluations found in the review. Only 8% of evaluations incorporated some aspect of clinical utility in their analysis and/or discussion. Although the definition of clinical utility used in this paper was broad to ensure that it encompasses all aspects of clinical utility, it could be that certain aspects described in the test evaluations were not accounted for. One reason for the clinical utility of a test only rarely being mentioned, could be the fact that clinical utility is often implied rather than being described. For example by pointing out that current testing and decision making is sub-optimal without explicitly indicating how POCT would improve this. Furthermore, the turn-around-time of the test was reported in more than half of the evaluations (52.5%) even though it is not among the tenmost important determinants according to GPs. This could possibly be because of GPs expectations that user friendliness and short turn-around-time are evident properties of a POCT; which is why these properties are considered a high priority in the evaluation of POCTs. Technical performance is considered the second most important determinant among GPs and it was addressed by almost half of the evaluations (48.3%).",

With respect to the aforementioned tests, the earliest year that information regarding the AQT90 FLEX was found, was in 2010, with the one test evaluation in this review being from 2015. For the Nycocard\u2122 Reader II, the earliest information about the test is from 2008, with the 11 test evaluations in this review being from 2009 (n = 2), 2010 (n = 2), 2011 (n = 1), 2013 (n = 3), 2015 (n = 2).There are some POCTs that did not have as many evaluations in this review, for example INR testing. Although POC INR testing is used in some outpatient labs and anticoagulation clinics, the reference standard remains clinical laboratory testing.20 The use of POC INR testing has become popular for at-home testing, where patients can easily use the device to monitor their INR and report their results to a clinician (either in person or via telephone) who would then adjust their anticoagulant dose, if necessary. Another use is for patient self-management, where patients not only tests their INR themselves but can self-adjust their dose using a predetermined algorithm or protocol.21,22 While some of the POCTs may also be applied by patients themselves, the focus of this review was related to the application of these tests in general practice. If an evaluation was on self-testing, it was not included.It is worth mentioning, that a large number (n = 33; 39.2%) of the 84 identified tests are manufactured by only four companies, namely Alere (n = 13), Roche (n = 11), Quidel (n = 5) and pts Diagnostics (n = 4), whereas the remainder of the tests (n = 51) are manufactured by a total of 44 different companies. The POCTs manufactured by these four companies, also have the most test evaluations. In total, almost half (n = 71; 47.0%) of the 151 evaluations in this review were of tests manufactured by them, with 34, 19, 9 and 9 evaluations of tests manufactured by Alere, Roche, Quidel and pts Diagnostics, respectively. Although test evaluation studies are, in most cases, performed to collect (additional) evidence on test performance and added value, they may also serve the purpose to increase awareness of test availability amongst care professionals.The biggest limitation of this review was missing studies because of not reporting the names or manufacturer of the POCT being evaluated. Furthermore, devices that have been discontinued or renamed provided further reduced the evidence base. Both of these factors could cause bias in the conclusions. Additional bias could also be caused because of the limited test selection (only applied studies in primary care). It is possible that by excluding evaluations of devices in secondary care, some tests applicable to primary as well were missed. However, if a POCT is truly relevant to primary care, it is expected that at least one study evaluating it in a primary care setting would have been found. Some of the identified tests have, presumably, been available on the market for a longer period of time that others. This makes the absolute number of evaluations per test hard to interpret. The determinants investigated in this review was identified by 12 based on a review of existing literature. The relative importance of each determinant, however, could be specific to Dutch GPs and two specific POCTs were used as reference when assigning weights. It is therefore uncertain whether the determinants and their relative importance can be transferred to other POCTs and settings.This review showed that, despite the growing market and rapid development of new POCTs, studies evaluating such tests fail to report on some of the key factors in the adoption of important innovative diagnostics in primary care. To ensure that an evaluation of a point-ofcare test is useful to primary care clinicians, future evaluations should not only focus on the technical performance aspects of a test, but also",
