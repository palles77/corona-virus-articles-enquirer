On Western blot, HsPCFT migrates as a broad band (\u223c55 kDa), higher than predicted (\u223c50 kDa) in cell lines. Western blot analysis required that membrane preparations not be incubated in the loading buffer above 50\u00b0C to avoid aggregation of the protein. Treatment of membrane fractions from HsPCFT-transfected HeLa cells with peptidyl N-glycanase F, or cells with tunicamycin, resulted in conversion to a \u223c35 kDa species. Substitution of asparagine residues of two canonical glycosylation sites to glutamine, individually, yielded a \u223c 47 kDa protein; substitution of both sites gave a smaller (\u223c35 kDa) protein.",

Recently, a novel folate transporter (PCFT) was identified that recapitulates the properties of intestinal folate absorption [8] . Confirmation that this transporter is required for intestinal folate absorption came from the observation that loss-of-function mutations in HsPCFT are the genetic basis for hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) (OMIM 229050) [8, 9] , an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects in both intestinal folate absorption and folate transport into the central nervous system [10] .",

Likewise, a low pH folate transport activity, now attributed to PCFT, has been demonstrated in the intestine [1, 11] , liver [12] , kidney [13] , and in human solid tumor cell lines [14, 15] . HsPCFT mediated folate transport can be distinguished from RFC mediated transport: (i) The former has a low pH optimum (\u223c5.5) while RFC has a pH optima of \u223c7.4. (ii) HsPCFT has a high affinity for folic acid and other folates (K m 's range from 0.5 to 1 \u00b5M) at low pH which decreases as the pH is increased. RFC has a very low affinity for folic acid (K i \u223c 200 \u00b5M) which, along with its affinity for other folates/antifolates, is largely pH-independent over a pH range of 5.5 to 7.4 [16] .

Both N-or C-terminal HA tagged N58Q/N68Q-HsPCFT migrated at a single band at a MW of \u223c35 kDa ( Figure 6, lower panel) . These data exclude proteolytic degradation of wild-type or deglycosylated forms of HsPCFT as a basis for the lower than predicted molecular size observed on Western blot.

As indicated in Figure 7 , fluorescence was detected in all permeabilized cells with the exception of mock transfected cells. No fluorescence could be detected in cells that were not permeabilized. Hence, both wild-type and deglycosylated HsPCFT proteins localized to the plasma membrane and both N-and C-termini were accessible to the antibody only when cells were permeabilized under these conditions. These data are consistent with a cytosolic localization for both the Nand C-terminus and indicates that the lack of N-glycosylation has little or no effect on HsPCFT membrane targeting.",

            "text": "HsPCFT is a recently discovered carrier protein that mediates intestinal folate absorption and transport of folates into the central nervous system [8] . HsPCFT is expressed in other tissues as well and a low-pH folate transport activity, presumably HsPCFT, is present in most human solid tumors and likely contributes to transport of folates in these settings [8, 14] . The murine ortholog of HsPCFT was reported to be a heme carrier protein, (HCP-1, SLC46A1), responsible for intestinal folate absorption that functions independent of pH (over a pH range of from 6.5 to 8.0) and with a low affinity for heme (K m =125 \u00b5M for [ 55 Fe]hemin) [28] . However, in studies from this laboratory [8] , and in a recent report from another laboratory [29] , it is clear that this is a high-affinity folate transporter (influx Km's in the range of 0.2 -1.0 \u00b5M) with a low pH optimum. Additional confirmation that the major, if not sole, function of this carrier is folate transport comes from the observation that loss-of-function mutations in HsPCFT result in an autosomal recessive disorder, hereditary folate malabsorption. Individuals with this disorder show no evidence of iron deficiency and the metabolic consequences of the transport defect can be corrected solely by the administration of pharmacological doses of folate [8, 9] .",

            "text": "The data indicate that HsPCFT is highly heat labile; at temperatures above 50\u00b0C the protein aggregates, a condition that must be considered in the preparation of cell membranes for SDS-PAGE. The basis for this aggregation is not clear but may be due to the properties of specific hydrophobic regions of the carrier as reported for SARS-CoV membrane protein [30] . On SDS-PAGE the wild-type protein ran as three bands at \u223c55 kDa, \u223c 47.2 kDa and \u223c 35.1 kDa. The three independent approaches used to assess HsPCFT glycosylation status yielded a deglycosylated protein with an apparent molecular size of \u223c 35 kDa, 15 kDa smaller than predicted size for nonglycosylated HsPCFT (\u223c 50 kDa). Further studies using HsPCFT HAtagged on the N-and C-termini excluded the possibility that this discrepancy is due to degradation of the protein. This anomalous electrophoretic behaviour is quite common among polytopic membrane proteins and is similar to what has been reported for the human norepinephrine [31] and glycine transporters [32] . This could be due to (i) the highly hydrophobic nature and basic pI of the transporter [33] and/or, (ii) preservation of the native, compact conformation and decreased SDS binding due to the heating limitation resulting in incomplete denaturation of the HsPCFT protein [34, 35] . Decreased SDS binding may decrease the migration rate by reducing the net charge; alternatively, it may increase the migration rate by reducing the mass and frictional drag. The intact disulfide bonds, which usually result in less SDS binding of a more compact shaped protein, can also cause faster migration rates [36] . However, there was no difference in the HsPCFT migration pattern when membranes were prepared with or without DTT before loading onto the gel. Replacement of the seven native cysteine residues with serines has no effect on HsPCFT function; hence, disulfide bonds are not required for proper HsPCFT folding and function (Unal ES et al, unpublished) .",

This is consistent with a topological model in which the N-terminus is localized to the cytoplasm. This configuration was supported by immunocytochemical analysis of both wildtype and deglycosylated HsPCFT constructs HA tagged at the amino terminus, visualized at the plasma membrane only when cells were first permeabilized with Triton X100 [39] [40] [41] [42] . This data also supports a model in which there is an even number of transmembrane domains, requiring that the C-terminus is also localized to the cytoplasm.

The latter role of glycosylation has been reported for many transporters such as the human norepinephrine [31] , glycine (GLYT1) [32] , glucose (GLUT1) [48] , organic anion (OAT4) [47] and organic cation transporters [49] . In these cases the transport proteins are heavily glycosylated on three or more asparagine residues and the deglycosylated protein retains only a small percentage of wild-type activity. In contrast, HsPCFT is glycosylated only on asparagine 58 and 68 and the majority of HsPCFT transport function was preserved in the N58Q/N68Q-HsPCFT mutant. Indeed, the small decrease observed could be due to the amino acid changes per se rather than the absence of glycosyl moieties since, at a tunicamycin concentration sufficient to completely abolish glycosylation, no significant decrease in HsPCFT function could be detected.",

The prerequisite for this approach is a functional deglycosylated transporter [51] . The observation that the majority of function is preserved in deglycosylated HsPCFT indicates that glycosylation scanning mutagenesis can be used to further evaluate the secondary structure of this carrier and that bacterial systems can be used to produce large quantities of this transporter for structural studies.",

Lower panel; Western blot analysis of membrane proteins from HeLa cells transiently transfected with wild-type or deglycosylated HsPCFT fused with an HA epitope on either the N-or C-terminus. An equal amount of lysate (20 \u00b5g) was loaded and the blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. The numbers on the left indicate the molecular sizes in the protein ladders. Each blot is representative of three separate experiments. HeLa cells were stably transfected with cDNA of wild-type or deglycosylated HsPCFT fused with the HA epitope on either the N-or C-terminus, then exposed to Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Green fluorescence indicates localization of HsPCFT, while red fluorescence indicates nucleic acids counterstained by propidium iodide. The image is representative of at least three experiments. The left panel shows cells subjected to permeabilization with Triton X-100 before exposure to antibody. The right panel shows cells that were not permeabilized.",
