            "text": "There are many reasons for the widespread use of these viruses as model systems in cell biology . First, they are surrounded by a lipid bilayer, referred to as the envelope, which has a simple protein composition . Second, after infection protein synthesis of the host cell is usually blocked and mainly viral proteins are made . Third, the infected cells synthesize very large amounts of a relatively small number of proteins that are essential for the virus . 367 biochemical and morphological analyses . Fourth, the ease with which mutants can be made and expressed make these viruses ideal candidates for genetic studies . Fifth, viral proteins are usually highly antigenic which facilitates the production of high titre antibodies . The final and crucial point is that since the genetic capacity of these viruses is so limited they must follow the basic cellular mechanisms for cell entry (usually via endocytosis), protein synthesis (using the ribosome/ER synthetic and translocation machinery), glycosylation and other post-translational modifications, as well as for intracellular transport from the ER to the plasma membrane . In addition, since these viruses fuse with cell membranes during the infection process they are powerful tools to study membrane fusion : in this respect the haemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus has now become the best characterized of all fusion proteins .' In the case of viruses such as SFV, VSV or influenza, the viral membrane glycoproteins are synthesized and transported to the plasma membrane in a manner indistinguishable from cellular plasma membrane proteins . It is the accumulation of these proteins at the cell surface which is responsible for the viral budding . This budding event is a very accurate sorting phenomenon since essentially only viral proteins are included in the bud, and all host proteins are excluded . Budding is the result of a protein-protein interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of a key viral membrane ('spike') glycoprotein and the cytoplasmically localized nucleocapsid . The latter is usually composed of a single copy of the genomic RNA or DNA and, in the simplest cases, multiple copies of a single capsid protein . Since the cytoplasmic domains of the viral membrane proteins are, in principle, available for this interaction throughout the biosynthetic pathway from the rough ER onwards, it is not immediately obvious what restricts the budding to the plasma membrane . The answer, in part, appears to lie in the fact that a critical density of viral spike proteins is required for the interaction . A demonstration of this fact came from experiments showing that monensin inhibited transport of SFV spikes out of the Golgi complex . These proteins continued to be synthesized and accumulated as a result in vesicles that corresponded to monensin-induced alterations of medial Golgi cisternae . Under this condition the nucleocapsids could bind in high concentrations and even bud into the Golgi complex .8 However, for other viruses such as VSV the situation is more complex . When the G glycoprotein of this virus was allowed to accumulate in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) as a result of a transport block at 20\u00b0C there was no evidence for either the matrix (M) or the nucleocapsid (N) protein on the membranes of this compartment . 9 Although the majority of enveloped viruses normally bud through the plasma membrane, there are a number of viral families whose members bud naturally into intracellular compartments of the biosynthetic pathway .10,11 This behaviour reflects the fact that the viral proteins which mediate these budding events are endowed with targeting information that retains them after synthesis in a subcompartment of the ER or Golgi complex . Since these proteins essentially behave as resident markers of the compartments into which the viruses bud it follows that they are of interest for cell biologists .",

Our goal will be to highlight some features of these viruses, and in particular their membrane glycoproteins . Aside from the fact that many of these viruses bud into intracellular compartments, the assembly of some of these viruses involves unusual and unprecedented phenomena, many of which have not been extensively studied, let alone explained at the molecular level . These events include the loss of a membrane in the lumen of the ER (rota), the passage of the virions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by traversing the nuclear envelope (herpes) and the successive envelopment by several membranes giving rise to a four-membraned form of the virus (poxvirus) . It is a reasonable guess that a mechanistic explanation of these phenomena may give new insights into fundamental cell processes .

Isolation of these membrane-encapsulated intermediates has demonstrated that VP7 is translocated across the membrane during maturation . 21 The lipid bilayer as well as the NS28 is someho\u1e81 discarded' from the virus surface giving rise to the mature, non-enveloped virus particles in the lumen of the ER . Electron micrographs of sections of infected cells reveal the presence of membrane fragments in the lumen of the ER adjacent to mature virions during this process . 20 However, the mechanism of this remarkable event is still a mystery despite the fact that the key proteins involved have been extensively studied . One suggestion is that a calcium-dependent phospholipase activity might be involved . 20 Also enigmatic is the question how cytoplasmic VP4 enters the ER and ends up as a fibre on the outside of the mature virus particle . 22 A recent study using the baculovirus expression system, where both VP6 and VP7 were co-expressed in insect cells, showed that 'double-shelled' particles, very similar to the mature (non-enveloped) rotavirus particles, could be assembled . 23 This suggests that the VP4, is not critical for this assembly process . Both NS28 and VP7 behave as typical ER resident membrane glycoproteins ( Figure 3 ) . NS28 has a membrane spanning domain and a non-cleaved hydrophobic domain at the NH2 terminus that contains the N-linked glycosylation sites . 24-27 The available evidence suggests that the second of the three hydrophobic domains of this protein is responsible for its retention in the ER . 28 It has a 131 amino acid COOH terminus that, as mentioned, interacts with the inner shell protein VP6 . VP7 is a highly unusual protein . It is translocated across the membrane of the ER as a typical membrane glycoprotein that contains a cleavable signal sequence . However, the cleaved signal sequence must somehow interact with the rest of the protein since, when the signal sequence of influenza HA is substituted for the authentic one, the expressed protein is secreted into the medium . 29 It seems likely that the signal sequence is also somehow involved in maintaining the VP7 in a membrane-bound form . Recent unpublished data from Maass and Atkinson shows that three amino acids, Ile, Thr and, Gly, in positions 9-11 from the NH2 terminus of the mature protein, are essential for retaining VP7 in the ER membrane ; any conservative alteration or deletion of these three residues results in the protein being secreted (D .

The data of this group suggest that the calcium is essential for the VP7 to attain its correct conformation and that in the absence of calcium this protein is degraded much more rapidly, presumably by the ER degradative pathway . 35 A recent in vivo study by Poruchynsky et a1 20 showed that in the presence of a calcium ionophore the maturation of the membrane bound to the mature particles was blocked .

For herpes the dense plaques on the inner nuclear envelope (NE) are shown as well as the notion that the virus, once budded into the lumen of the nuclear envelope, fuses with the outer nuclear envelope, thereby releasing the capsid into the cytoplasm . The latter is then enveloped by a cisterna that is believed to be of Golgi origin . This form, like the vaccinia IEV is thought to fuse with the plasma membrane releasing enveloped, infectious viruses into the medium . For bunya and corona the viruses are widely believed to exit the cell via the vesicular transport pathway . For reference, the budding of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) at the plasma membrane is also shown . The intermediate compartment (IC) is shown as being continuous from the rough ER to the first morphologically recognizable Golgi cisterna . We emphasize that the available data do not allow an unequivocal distinction between this model, which we prefer, and the alternative idea of a physically separate intermediate compartment that would necessitate an extra vesicular transport step . The line/question mark is meant to indicate this point . The haemagglutinin protein, VP4, is also a unique protein whose role in the assembly is far from clear . It is apparently made on free ribosomes, lacks a signal sequence and is not glycosylated ; it is, however, a relatively hydrophobic protein which possesses a conserved 17 amino acid hydrophobic stretch that shows homology to the putative fusion peptides of the El proteins of SFV and Sindbis virus . 36 trypsin, VP4 is cleaved to VP5 and VP8, an effect which increases, and may even be obligatory for, viral infectivity . 41 This cleavage does not occur in the infected cell but rather in the intestine of the target organism prior to infection . 14 Rotavirus particles do not enter the secretory pathway and are only disseminated following cell lysis .

Diagram to show the topological models of the key viral glycoproteins known to be involved in the assembly of bunya, corona and rotaviruses . Note that the bunyavirus polyprotein in many cases also contains the non-structural protein NS M either preceding or in between G1 and G2, and is co-translationally cleaved (for more details see Matsuoka et a1 63 ) . The arrowheads indicate sites of proteolytic cleavages . The M glycoprotein of MHV contains only 0-linked oligosaccharides, which is quite unusual among viral membrane glycoproteins . They are formed by the sequential, post-translational addition of N-acetyl galactosamine, galactose and sialic acid to a cluster of four Ser/Thr residues which are directly adjacent to the N-terminal initiating Met . This Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr motif is identical to the 0-glycosylated amino terminus of glycophorin A . While the N-acetyl galactosamine residue is most likely added in the IC , 46 recent data using brefeldin A (BFA) argues that the subsequent additions of galactose and sialic acid occur in a Golgi compartment(s) proximal to the TGN . 54 Thus after treatment with BFA newly synthesized M acquires all three sugars whereas, under identical conditions, newly synthesized G protein of VSV acquired endo H resistance (in agreement with a previous study 57 ), and fucose, but did not acquire sialic acid on its Nlinked oligosaccharides . These data argue that the addition of sialic acid to O-linked oligosaccharides occurs in a BFA-'sensitive', pre-TGN compartment while sialylation of N-linked oligosaccharides occurs in the BFA-'resistant' TGN .",

Thus, on average, molecules of G2 spent considerably longer in the ER than G 1 . During the folding in the ER, G2 could be coprecipitated with Bip while both proteins formed a complex with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) . In contrast to these observations Chen and Compans 65 found the majority of both GI and G2 of PTV engaged in heterodimer formation between newly synthesized molecules . Already after a 3 min pulse labelling both glycoproteins could be demonstrated in oligomeric complexes . In addition, a small fraction of G2 also assembled into homodimers . This may be related to the observation that G2 is produced in excess over G1, as has been reported also for Rift Valley fever virus . 66 The precise mechanism of this independent synthesis of G2 is not firmly established but may involve internal translation initiation . 66 Recent expression studies using vaccinia virus showed that the two glycoproteins of another bunyavirus, the Hantaan virus, can only leave the ER when they are co-expressed, 67 possibly because the newly-synthesized proteins have to interact in order to acquire their correct conformation . In contrast, the G2 glycoprotein of PTV was found to be able to leave the ER and reach the plasma membrane when expressed by itself . 65,6 s Both after bunyavirus-infection and after coexpression of G1 and G2, the G1/G2 heterodimer clearly possesses information that is essential and sufficient for Golgi targeting and retention . 62, [69] [70] [71] This complex cannot be chased out of the Golgi complex, even after about 6 h of cycloheximide treatment, 70 unless released from the cell within virions . Morphological studies 72 as well as the analysis of the N-linked oligosaccharides of mature G 1 and G2 are consistent with their localization to a Golgi compartment prior to the TGN . 65,73 Thus, the mature proteins have negligible sialic acid . 65, 70 However, the small amount of these glycoproteins that are found on the cell surface (perhaps in fully budded virions) do contain sialic acid . 74 This argues that the lack of sialic acid on these proteins when they are resident in the Golgi complex does indeed reflect their pre-TGN localization .",

Whereas the UUK virus glycoproteins were retained in the Golgi complex, as expected, the SFV glycoproteins were glycosylated and transported (with a slight delay in the ER to Golgi step) to the cell surface . It seems clear that it is the site of accumulation of the G1/G2 heterodimers that is important for the bunyavirus assembly since in the presence of BFA the PTV assembles in the region of the ER . 76 Although the bunyaviruses normally bud into the Golgi complex, the Rift Valley fever (RFV) virus appears to bud both into the Golgi complex and out through the basolateral membranes of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes . 77 In the hepatocyte, recent data argue strongly that the pathway of newly synthesized plasma membrane proteins from the TGN to the apical membrane of hepatocytes obligatorily passes via the basolateral membrane . 78 In the case of RFV a significant fraction of the viral glycoproteins seems to escape the Golgi retention mechanism and presumably follows the same route to the basolateral membrane as the VSV-G protein in MDCK cells . 79",

Although the next step is not unequivocally established, the most likely scenario is that the enveloped form in the lumen of the nuclear envelope fuses with the outer nuclear envelope leaving the naked capsid free in the cytoplasm . 100, 101 If this pathway is correct, it would argue that it simply functions to transport the nuclearly synthesized, DNA-containing capsids into the cytoplasm ; it seems reasonable to expect that the capsid, which is about 100 nm in diameter, is too large to traverse through the nuclear pore, whose size limit is considered to be in the 10 nm range . 102 In the next step, which appears similar to the second envelopment of vaccinia virus to form the IEV (see above), the nucleocapsid appears to become engulfed by two cisternal membranes in the region of the Golgi complex . 103 The latter are enriched in viral glycoproteins such as gp350/220 (Epstein Barr virus), whose oligosaccharides are endo H resistant and rich in fucosyl residues, 98,104 consistent with their Golgi localization . This cisterna stains with the cytochemical marker acid phosphatase which, within the Golgi complex, is a marker of the trans-cisternae . 105 Together, these data suggest a model whereby herpesencoded envelope proteins would behave as trans-Golgi markers which could interact on their cytoplasmic domains with the nucleocapsids . The resulting enveloped form would be covered by two membranes . This envelopment step appears to be crucial for infectivity . It is blocked by BFA which also leads to a large accumulation of viral particles in the lumen of the nuclear envelope . 103 As for the vaccinia EEV, it is currently believed that the latter fuses with the plasma membrane releasing the mature virus with one envelope into the extracellular medium . 97",

For those viruses in which the nucleocapsid is fully assembled before the interaction with the membrane occurs it is still not clear, for example, whether the capsids bind a preformed patch of membrane receptors or whether they initially bind a few molecules and that this process then recruits and traps further copies of the membrane protein . 2 It is also far from clear why or how the viruses we have discussed have evolved the capacity to bud into intracellular organelles rather than out through the plasma membrane, the route taken by the majority of budding viruses . We can suggest two possible advantages of the intracellular budding route . First, at least some of the viral membrane proteins that, for most viruses, are exposed on the plasma membrane, are kept within the cell in the viruses discussed in this review . This could be an advantage in reducing the chances that the infected cell will be recognized by antibodies and killed by complement lysis before infectious viruses are produced . The second possibility to consider is that the intracellular budding route avoids the need for the nucleocapsids, or nucleocapsid precursors, to be assembled on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane . The zone beneath the plasma membrane is usually the site of a dense cortical network of cytoskeletal elements . These could, conceivably, provide a barrier for the nucleocapsids of some, but clearly not all, viruses to pass through . In other words, the viruses take advantage of the transport system that the secretory pathway provides from the perinuclear region to the plasma membrane .",

The last few years has seen an increasing use of the powerful perforated systems that enable easy access of membrane impermeable reagents into the cell while still maintaining a high degree of structural organization . Examples of this approach are the filter disruption method, 113 the use of mechanically broken cells114 and the use of streptolysin 0 .115 It is our belief that the time is now ripe for the use of both in vitro and perforated cell systems to study the assembly of the intracellular viruses discussed in this review .",

These data show clearly that a high affinity interaction exists between VP6 on the surface of the nucleocapsid and the cytoplasmic domain of the NS28 . For coronavirus an attempt is now being made (PR) to add purified nucleocapsids to membranes from cells double-expressing the S and M proteins . In the case of vaccinia virus (GG) we have started to develop a system to study the in vitro assembly of the IMV which takes advantage of the fact that rifampicin can be used to reversibly block the assembly of the IV . Thus, cells can be broken by gentle homogenization, the drug can be washed out and conditions are sought that enable, first the IV and subsequently the IMV to be assembled . For herpesvirus one could envisage setting up an in vitro system with isolated nuclei in order to follow the proposed pathway across the nuclear envelope . The attractive feature of these in vitro approaches with respect to the assembly of intracellular viruses is that a straightforward functional assay is available . The ultimate test and goal of such studies must be the production of infectious viral particles .",
