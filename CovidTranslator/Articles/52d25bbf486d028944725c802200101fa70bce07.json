These viruses comprise a functional, rather than taxonomic group, almost all of which are nonenveloped (lacking a lipid outer layer) and transmitted by the fecal-oral route. From an epidemiological perspective, human noroviruses (HuNoV) are now considered the most important of the foodborne viruses, causing 58% of foodborne illnesses of known etiology in USA. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is also important as it causes perhaps the most severe of the viral foodborne diseases. There are other important viruses that can be transmitted by foodborne routes, although their significance is less well characterized.",

They are tissue tropic (enteric viruses infect the gastrointestinal tract) and species specific, so human enteric viruses infect humans but not other animals, and vice versa. Enteric virus particles are shed in extremely high numbers in the feces of infected individuals, and hence their transmission is usually due to the fecal-oral route. However, epidemiological evidence suggests that NoV particles are also shed in vomitus and this may significantly increase transmissibility of these viruses, especially if virus particles become aerosolized during vomiting events. In general, enteric viruses are highly infectious and typically disease can be caused by a small number (perhaps 10-100) of infectious virus particles.",

Molluscan shellfishassociated outbreaks of hepatitis were also reported in the 1950s and 1960s. The cause of this disease was HAV, which was identified as an enterically transmitted infectious agent when Dr. Saul Krugman intentionally fed mentally disabled children purified fecal extracts prepared from symptomatic patients; the children subsequently developing classic hepatitis symptoms.

Particularly important was the nucleic acid amplification method polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was readily adapted to the detection of RNA viruses by preceding PCR with a reverse transcription (RT) step, hence the designation RT-PCR.

The Mead et al. (1999) publication, along with some high profile outbreaks in the late 1990s and early 2000s, also focused attention on foods other than molluscan shellfish as significant causes of foodborne viral gastroenteritis. In fact, we now know that foods such as salads, bakery products, and sandwiches are responsible for more NoV and HAV infections than are molluscan shellfish. Fresh produce (berries and green onions) have also emerged as important vehicles of infection. The association of disease with foods such as these suggest that the hands of infected food handlers are arguably the most common source of the virus contamination for many if not most foods. Recent epidemiological data continue to support the fact that viruses, particularly HuNoV, are the most common cause of foodborne disease of known etiology in USA.",

In healthy adults, the incubation period for NoV infection ranges from 24 to 48 h, with symptoms lasting 12-72 h. The disease is gastrointestinal in nature, typically presenting with vomiting (hallmark symptom), diarrhea, and abdominal cramps that may or may not be accompanied by fever. In certain at-risk groups, particularly the elderly, NoV infection can result in a much more severe disease, with symptoms lasting as long as 6 weeks.

This is largely because of poor sensitivity due to the lack of broadly reactive antibodies that will detect all HuNoV strains. The high degree of genetic diversity for the NoV has historically complicated the development of broadly reactive RT-qPCR methods. Four 'regions' of the NoV genome have been used for primer design (designated regions A, B, C, and D). These regions are generally conserved among HuNoV strains of the same genogroup. The ORF-1-ORF2 junction (just downstream of region B) seems to be the most conserved and is frequently used for genogroup-specific detection. For strain comparison (as might be appropriate in outbreak investigation), primers corresponding to the NoV capsid region (region D) are usually used. Commercial RT-qPCR method detection methods are available for use in the food and environmental sector, but in all cases, substantial sample preparation to concentrate the viruses and remove the sample matrix is required before the application of RT-qPCR for detection. Taken together, HuNoV detection in clinical, food, and environmental samples is not done routinely and there are wide regional variations in protocols. This highlights the need for standardized methods of detection and consistency of surveillance and disease reporting across countries.",

Human isolates of HAV comprise a single serotype, but sequence heterogeneity within the VP1/2A can be used to differentiate HAV into seven unique genotypes. Of these seven genotypes, genotypes I and III predominate in human disease. Transmitted primarily by contact with the blood of infected individuals or through male homosexual relations, only approximately 5% of HAV cases are foodborne, with transmission almost always in keeping with the fecal-oral route. Once infected, the disease incubation period averages 4 weeks (range of 2-6 weeks). Disease initially presents with a prodrome that includes fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms progress 1-2 weeks later into inflammation of the liver and jaundice. Hospitalization occurs in 31.5% of cases, with mortality rates estimated at 2.4%.

Within the fresh produce category, products such as raspberries, strawberries, lettuce, and green onions have caused outbreaks, some quite sizable. A good example is the 2003 US outbreak when green onions served at a single Pennsylvania restaurant resulted in more than 600 HAV cases, with 124 hospitalizations, and 3 deaths. Fresh produce most likely becomes contaminated by the use of human sewage-contaminated irrigation water, because of human defecation in production fields, and/or from the hands of infected food handlers during harvest or preparation phases of the farm-to-fork continuum. Still, the most common cause of HAV foodborne outbreaks in general is poor personal hygiene of infected food handlers.

Disease in humans is typically mild, except for the H5N1 virus, which has been responsible for a number of human deaths following outbreaks. The potential for spread of this virus through the food chain has been of concern because the virus appears to survive on imported meat. There is also concern for the risk of fecal contamination of water that is subsequently used in production agriculture or even for food preparation. However, it has been documented that HPAI is susceptible to thermal processes, meaning that the consumption of properly cooked food poses little risk for HPAI infection.",

The coronavirus that causes sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was first recognized as a human pathogen in 2002 in association with an outbreak in China. The virus was subsequently detected in more than 30 other countries, infecting more than 8500 people with a 10% mortality rate. Although generally thought to be spread exclusively by respiratory routes, there is evidence that SARS-CoV can replicate in the small and large intestines, causing diarrhea that results in fecal shedding of the virus. Thus, the fecal-oral transmission route cannot be excluded. However, SARS-CoV are sensitive to fairly mild heat treatment and commonly used disinfectants, suggesting that attention to proper food handling and preparation measures should control foodborne transmission of the virus. Taken together, the spread of SARS-CoV via contaminated food products remains possible but is now considered unlikely.",

The NORS system provides some important information that can be used relative to epidemiological attribution estimates, but it only reports on epidemic disease.

This is not surprising due to the mild nature of most infections and the lack of routine clinical diagnostics. Of particular interest is the proportion of HuNoV infections that are caused by contaminated foods as compared to other transmission routes. Getting at these estimates will undoubtedly require targeted epidemiological efforts such as active surveillance and/or case control studies, both of which are expensive and timeconsuming. Further, until standardized reporting at the country and international level is established, the true burden of foodborne viral disease will remain unknown.",

In general, if wastewater is adequately treated through primary, secondary, and tertiary steps, and including chlorination, the risk of viral contamination is minimal. When it comes to foods, many measures classically applied to control bacterial growth are not very effective against viruses. For example, exposure to extremes of pH (2.0-10.0) and water activity will have little or no effect on the infectivity of enteric viruses. Refrigeration and freezing actually help to preserve virus infectivity. The efficacy of standard thermal inactivation treatments is dependent on the food matrix and virus studied. As a general rule of thumb, NoV and HAV appear to be less sensitive to heat than are typical Gramnegative bacteria, and more sensitive to heat than spores. High hydrostatic pressure has been recognized as an emerging processing technology for inactivating viruses in molluscan shellfish, however, similar to thermal inactivation, the effectiveness of the treatment is variable and virus specific. Enteric viruses are also notably resistant to ionizing radiation.",

            "text": "It is for this reason, current control measures focus on the prevention of contamination, rather than treatments to inactivate viruses after a contamination event has occurred. The central tenets of control are good hygiene practices in food processing and handling environments, and prevention of contamination in the preharvest environments. Because the decontamination of hands and surfaces in food processing and preparation is critical to preventing virus contamination, an important effort is assuring effective hand decontamination. The best method remains the traditional soap and water wash followed by towel drying. Commercial alcohol-based hand sanitizers should not be used in place of adequate hand washing. Of course, hand washing compliance in retail, institutional, and home settings remains a challenge and must be continuously advocated. There has been interest in further promoting the need for infected food handlers to report illness symptoms and abstain from work during periods of time in which they are actively shedding virus. However, the latter may be difficult in light of emerging evidence suggesting that shedding of HuNoV may persist for weeks after symptom resolution. Adequate cleaning and disinfection of surfaces is also important to preventing virus contamination of foods, but the availability of disinfecting agents with specific activity against the nonenveloped enteric viruses is a pressing need. Also needed are better microbiological indicator systems that have a more direct correlation with virus contamination of water in production environments, as the fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli remain poor indicators for this application. This is particularly relevant for molluscan shellfish and fresh produce production.",

The development of molecular techniques during the 1990s, in combination with increased epidemiological surveillance, have raised awareness of the importance of viruses to foodborne illness. Although methodological advancements have been made, much still remains unknown. The lack of a culture system for HuNoV is probably the single most important limiting factor to studying and controlling these viruses. With availability of such a method, or in its absence, availability of better cultivable surrogates or more sensitive detection methods for complex sample matrices, scientists would be able to tackle the challenges associated with trying to control foodborne viruses. Likewise, the availability of routine clinical assays would result in greater awareness of these diseases and improvements in reporting and epidemiological surveillance. The field of food virology is set to grow rapidly in the coming years as scientists tackle these problems with the aid of developing technologies.",
