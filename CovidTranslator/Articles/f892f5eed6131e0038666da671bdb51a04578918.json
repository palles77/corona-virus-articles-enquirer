            "text": "Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization among both adults and children in the United States, accounting for more than 800,000 hospitalizations and more than 400,000 emergency department visits in 2014. 1, 2 It is among the most expensive conditions treated in US hospitals with national aggregate costs of $9.5 billion in 2013. 3 A causal pathogen is often not identified. A 2015 prospective, multi-center study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified a responsible pathogen in only 38% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults requiring hospitalization. 4 CAP is an infection of the lung parenchyma that is acquired outside of hospitals or extended-care facilities. 5 Viral pathogens were identified in 27% of cases and bacterial pathogens in 14% of cases. 5 In adults of all ages, human rhinovirus and influenza were the most frequently identified viruses. 5 Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causal bacterium. Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly more common among patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level care. 4 Other bacteria identified in CAP include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. 5 Less common bacterial causes include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These and other bacteria may be considered more likely in patients with certain risk factors ( Table 1) . 6 DIAGNOSIS A diagnosis of pneumonia should be considered in patients presenting with acute onset fever or chills and cough. The cough may be described as productive. Additional symptoms frequently seen include fatigue, anorexia, and pleuritic chest pain. Important components of a history include recent travel, history of underlying lung disease, and smoking history. 4,6 A study by Diehr and colleagues 7 found that history of alcoholism or bloody sputum have relative risk of 1, so the presence of these findings is not predictive of pneumonia. Physical examination findings frequently appreciated in patients with pneumonia include decreased breath sounds, rales, tactile fremitus, and crackles. 4, 8 Tachypnea and hypotension are more worrisome symptoms that may also be seen and require urgent evaluation. 4 It is imperative to maintain a high level of suspicion in immunocompromised or elderly and nursing home patients, because they frequently display fewer overt symptoms of pneumonia when compared with the general population. 8, 9 No individual component of the history or physical examination is useful in diagnosing pneumonia, but the presence of multiple findings is required ( Table 2 ). In adults presenting with acute cough, the baseline probability of pneumonia is only 5%. Absence of any vital sign abnormality (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate) reduces the predicted probability of pneumonia to 1%. 8 A chest radiograph should be ordered for any patient with abnormal vital signs defined as temperature higher than 100 F, heart rate higher than 100 bpm, or respiratory rate higher than 20 bpm. Imaging should also be obtained for physical examination abnormalities of crackles or decreased breath sounds in a patient without asthma. 10 Infectious Disease Society of America 2016 Guidelines recommend imaging with a demonstrable infiltrate to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia and to exclude other causes of cough and fever such as acute bronchitis. 11 Although X-ray imaging is a mainstay of diagnosis of pneumonia, the British Thoracic Society recommends the entire clinical picture should be considered when making a decision to treat. 12 A systematic review found that among patients who are sick enough to be admitted with a clinical diagnosis of CAP but have a normal initial chest radiograph, approximately 1 in 10 will develop radiographic evidence of pneumonia within 72 hours. 8 In such cases, it is appropriate to treat the patient empirically for pneumonia and repeat imaging in 24 to 48 hours. 11 Community resources and access to imaging may also affect decision to treat without imaging.",

            "text": "Routine blood and sputum culture testing is costly and often low-yield. 13 However, more extensive diagnostic testing should be considered in patients who are at risk for infection with unusual pathogens, who are not responding to treatment, or when additional testing is likely to change antibiotic management (Table 3) . 11, 12 It is reasonable to consider respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine viral causes of symptoms, so that inappropriate antibiotic use can be limited. Additional testing for M. tuberculosis should be considered in a patient presenting with persistent cough, particularly in the setting of weight loss, malaise, night sweats, or hemoptysis. Additional risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) include immigration from an endemic country, residing in a homeless shelter, intravenous drug use, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Persons who work with people at high risk for TB infection are also considered high risk. 12, 14 TREATMENT Most cases of pneumonia can be managed in the outpatient setting. Several severity assessment tools have been developed to help determine appropriate treatment settings. The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) considers 20 variables to stratify patients into 1 of 5 risk categories (I-V) based on risk of death within 30 days. 15 Given the number of parameters required, it is not frequently used in general practice. The CURB65 assessment tool was introduced in 2003 by the British Thoracic Society. 16 Similar to the PSI, it calculates risk of 30-day mortality, but instead only uses 5 variables (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age >65), with one point awarded for each if present, allowing for greater ease of use. 15, 16 The CRB65 can be calculated without blood urea and thus is useful in the outpatient setting. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found no significant difference in test performance when comparing the 3 severity tools. 15 It was noted that the PSI negative likelihood ratio suggests it may be superior in identifying low-risk patients, and the CURB65 and CRB65 may be superior in identifying high-risk patients. 15 A CURB65 or CRB65 score of 0 or 1 demonstrates low risk of mortality and suggests a patient can be managed in the outpatient setting. A score of 3 or higher should warrant hospital admission. It is always appropriate to consider a patient's social circumstances and treatment wishes when making treatment decisions 12,16 ( Fig. 1 ; CURB65 score 12 ). When available, treatment of CAP should be guided by local resistance patterns. In previously healthy patients who are appropriate for outpatient treatment, recommended first-line treatment is with a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin targeting the most common causal pathogen S. pneumoniae. Doxycycline is an alternative option. Patients with comorbidities such as diabetes; chronic heart, lung, renal, or liver disease; alcoholism; asplenia; impaired immune system; or recent antibiotic use within the last 3 months have an increased risk for drug-resistant S pneumoniae. As such, a respiratory fluoroquinolone or b-lactam plus a macrolide is recommended ( Table 4 ). 11 A 2014 Cochrane review found no significant differences in efficacy between antibiotic regimens, although there were differences in adverse effects when comparing antibiotics within a single class. 17 Patients appropriate for inpatient non-ICU treatment should also be treated with a respiratory fluoroquinolone or macrolide with b-lactam. Patients should be treated for a minimum of 5 days and should be clinically stable with resolving symptoms before treatment is discontinued. 11, 18 Patients with high severity of infection or with extrapulmonary manifestations may benefit from longer duration of therapy, such as 7 to 10 days or until improving. 11, 12 In recent years, there has been emerging data supporting the use of adjunctive corticosteroids in the inpatient treatment of CAP. As this is an area of research, multiple recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been published, some with conflicting findings. A 2011 Cochrane review that included relevant CAP studies through the year 2010 showed that corticosteroid use accelerates time to symptom resolution and clinical stability, with infrequent adverse effects. 19 Similarly, a 2015 systematic review by Siemieniuk and colleagues 20 included studies from 2011 through mid-2015. Their analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials found significantly decreased mortality in severe pneumonia, decreased need for mechanical ventilation, decreased occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, decreased time to clinical stability, and shorter duration of hospitalization. 20 Hyperglycemia requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with corticosteroids. 20, 21 The most recent IDSA and BTS guidelines do not make recommendations regarding the routine use of adjunctive corticosteroid for CAP. 11, 12 Given the variations in dose and route of administration, an optimal agent and dose is unknown. Further research is needed to determine steroid dosing and duration, as well as what patient populations are most likely to benefit from its use. 20, 21 There are a large number of studies assessing the role of the infection biomarker procalcitonin in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with bacterial infections. 22 A Cochrane 2017 meta-analysis in the primary care setting concluded that the use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment results in lower risks of mortality, lower antibiotic consumption, and lower risk for antibiotic-related side effects. 23 Procalcitonin values too low or too high usually exclude bacterial infection, but not always. 24 Per practitioner discretion and, depending on patient complexity and other comorbidities, a follow-up appointment after successful management in the primary care setting may be arranged. At this appointment, repeat X-ray imaging to confirm resolution of pneumonia is not indicated if the patient seems clinically well. In patients with persistence of symptoms or who have a high risk of lung cancer (age > 50, >30 pack year smoking history), repeat X-ray imaging or low-dose computerized tomography (CT) scan to screen for lung cancer can be considered. 12 ",

            "text": "Pneumonia is considered \"nonresolving\" if there is an inadequate clinical response despite antibiotic treatment. 11 The incidence of treatment failure is 6% to 15% and is associated with a 5-fold increase in mortality. 29 IDSA broadly classifies nonresponse into 2 different groups: (1) progressive pneumonia characterized by clinical deterioration and (2) persistent pneumonia with absence or delay of clinical stability. 11 Progressive pneumonia with deterioration is characterized by respiratory failure and/ or septic shock and typically occurs within 72 hours. Persistent pneumonia with absent or delayed response is typically considered after a time period of 72 hours, because this is often regarded as the median time required for clinical stability. 11, 29 Concern for nonresponse in a patient with pneumonia should initiate a systematic evaluation of possible causes. Host factors that may explain poor response should be considered, including high initial severity score, risk factors for infection with unusual organisms, underlying comorbidities, or risk factors for multi-drug-resistant pathogens ( Table 5) . 24 In areas with high prevalence of HIV or TB, testing is recommended. 30 Results of initial microbiological tests such as blood or sputum cultures should be reviewed, including any sensitivity data. Repeat blood cultures should be obtained in the setting of clinical deterioration. Additional laboratory testing for S. pneumonia and Legionella pneumophila via urine antigen testing may be performed, because they may remain positive for days after initiating antibiotic treatment. Additional imaging such as chest CT may be beneficial for assessing interval progression or improvement or identifying pleural effusions, lung abscesses, or pulmonary embolism. If pleural effusions are identified in a patient with treatment failure, thoracentesis should be performed to evaluate for empyema. In select patients, bronchoscopy with protected bronchial sampling or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be beneficial to provide diagnostic information for infectious causes and noninfectious mimics, such as pulmonary eosinophilia, drug-induced pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, or pulmonary fibrosis. 11, 29 Primary or metastatic neoplastic lesions obstructing the bronchus may cause accumulation of secretions distal to the obstruction, predisposing to infection. Both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma can present with lung involvement, with typical radiographic findings of hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, but may also have a presenting pattern that suggests infection. 31 ",

As in the United States, S pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. aureus are the dominant pneumonia isolates in developing countries. It must be considered that bacterial resistance patterns from different countries may differ in these otherwise commonplace bacteria. 34 Respiratory symptoms occur in up to half of patients with malaria, and the presentation may seem similar to that of pneumonia. Thus, in a patient returning from a malariaendemic area, blood smear testing for malaria should be performed. 35 Increased time spent at hotels or on cruise ships in a patient presenting with symptoms of pneumonia should increase suspicion for Legionella. 30 Travelers returning from East and Southeast Asia, as well as Australia, with a severe pneumonia may have been exposed to Burkholderia pseudomallei-the causative agent of melioidosis, which can cause severe necrotizing pneumonia and has 14% to 40% mortality despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. 30 Severe pneumonia may also be because of viruses such as influenza, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or hantavirus. A returned traveler with pneumonia with eosinophilia should raise suspicion for helminth infection. 30, 34 Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that is relatively common in North, Central, and South America and given its growth in bird and bat droppings is associated with activities such as cave exploration. Coccidioides immitis is endemic in the southwest United States and northern Mexico, as well as smaller areas in Central America. It is spread through inhalation of spores found in the soil. Fungal infection with H. capsulatum and C immitis are often asymptomatic but may also present as a flulike illness with fever, malaise, and dry cough 1 to 3 weeks after exposure. 34, 36 Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia",

Clinical acumen is key to successfully diagnosing CP. The universal symptom of CP is cough. Other symptoms may include chest pain, headache, arthralgia, nausea, and abdominal pain. 54 Most common signs to look for include fever, tachypnea, labored breathing, rhonchi, crackles, and wheezing. 54 Other physical signs to identify include grunting, nasal flaring, and chest retractions because these increase the likelihood of CP. 55 Diagnostic testing is usually performed, when available, and would include assessment of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, chest radiograph, complete blood cell count, respiratory microbial panel by PCR, ultrasound of the chest (when medically indicated), and cultures. Disagreement about whether blood cultures are warranted exists in the literature. As per a recent study, blood cultures have not been shown to assist with clinical management in children hospitalized with pneumonia. 56 The Infectious Diseases Society of America, however, recommends blood cultures for all hospitalized children with pneumonia. 57",
