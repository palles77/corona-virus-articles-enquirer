Our objective was to determine the compliance with respiratory hygiene of triage nurses at 2 university hospital centers and to identify factors influencing compliance to the respiratory hygiene principles of emergency health care workers. Methods: A 2-part, cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted at 2 training centers. An anonymous observation of compliance with respiratory hygiene by triage emergency nurses was performed. A selfadministered, voluntary questionnaire on attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge of respiratory hygiene guidelines was distributed to the health care workers at the emergency department of the 2 hospital sites. Results: Median objective compliance with respiratory hygiene measures of triage nurses was 22% (interquartile range [IQR], 11%-33%). Median perceived compliance of the health care workers was 68% (IQR, 61%-79%). Median actual knowledge score was 75% (IQR, 75%-100%). Overall, 91.9% of respondents believed that the mask was an effective preventive measure. The main obstacles toward mask wearing by the health care worker were \"tendency to forget\" (37.8%) and \"discomfort\" (35.1%). Conclusion: The compliance rate at our institution is very low. We identified a few factors affecting adherence to respiratory hygiene measures that are of potential use in targeting groups and formulating recommendations.",

            "text": "The limitations of vaccination can also be demonstrated with influenza. Every winter, influenza is a main cause of respiratory deterioration, admissions, and death. Although the rate of vaccination is better among at-risk individuals, the vaccination rate in the general population has been as low as 35% in 2005. 6 Furthermore, we know that, with the correct vaccine strain and healthy individuals, the efficacy reaches only 70% to 90%. 6 This is decreased in at-risk populations, such as children and the immunocompromised. 6 Because antiviral medication is not part of current preventive strategies in Canada, 7 respiratory precautions become very important in the control of seasonal as well as pandemic strains of influenza. 5 Many experts have reflected on nonpharmacologic preventive strategies. 8, 9 There is currently evidence regarding the use of handwashing. Despite this incontestable evidence, handwashing has only a 40% health care compliance rate around the world. 10 When it comes to respiratory infection transmission, the literature makes reference to respiratory hygiene as a mode of prevention. In particular, the department of Health and Human Services in the United States 11 emphasises 5 key measures: (1) education of health care professionals, patients, and visitors; (2) posted instructions for patients and visitors; (3) control measures aimed at the index patient (mask, tissues, and others); (4) hand hygiene; and (5) spatial separation between infected and noninfected patients. Patient and visitor education is vital because it has been shown that spread of infection often occurs even before patient has been seen by medical personnel. 1 Although respiratory hygiene care has been well defined, there are few studies with disappointing results regarding compliance to these measures. 12, 13 A health promotion model Predisposing, Reinforcing and Enabling Factors in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE) has been developed, 13 and the PRECEDE-PROCEED approach 14 can be used for the evaluation of public health measure efficacy. 9, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] As efforts regarding teaching and advocating infection control have been made at our institution, the objectives of this study were, first, to assess the compliance with respiratory hygiene by emergency triage nurses at our university hospital center and, second, to document the attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge of the health staff on respiratory hygiene working at the emergency department using a knowledge-attitudes-practices self-applied questionnaire.",

The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Community Health. First, a cross-sectional descriptive study was performed, consisting of an anonymous systematic observation of nurses in triage from 11th to 18th of February. Five students in medicine documented actual observance of respiratory hygiene by emergency triage nurses in the presence of a patient with fever and cough. The sample was a nonprobability convenience sample because all nurses meeting a patient with symptoms of respiratory infection between the 11th and 18th of February, during day, evening, and night shift, were part of our study (n \u00bc 115 observations). Nurse participation was voluntary, with only 1 refusal. They were also informed that the observations were designed to improve the quality of care.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Nine items (Table 1) regarding proper identification and isolation of respiratory infection were evaluated (observation tool available on request to corresponding author). If the patient was already wearing a mask or appropriately isolated before seeing the nurse, these facts were noted. Several opportunities could be reported for a single nurse. Because of ethical issues, all health workers chosen for observation were nurses because direct observation could be performed in the waiting room without disturbing patient care. We then conducted a second cross-sectional descriptive study with a knowledge-attitudes-practices questionnaire (questionnaire available on request to corresponding author), distributed on February 18 and 19 to health care personnel at the 2 emergency units. The questionnaire assessed knowledge, attitudes, and subjective compliance and was administered on a voluntary basis to all health staff members present in both emergency rooms (triage and observation rooms) on February 18 and 19, 2009, during different shifts (day, evening, night). The questionnaire was a combination derived from the literature. 13, 15, [19] [20] [21] [22] This tool allowed us to collect demographic data on (real or perceived) knowledge, attitudes, and practices collected in connection with the observance of the respiratory precautions. A 0 to 4 Likert scale was used for the following elements of the questionnaire: frequency of recommendation of wearing mask by patient, wearing mask by staff, hand hygiene before and after patient contact, as well as informing other colleagues of respiratory precautions. These elements were combined to calculate a score of perceived compliance. A perceived knowledge score was calculated with a 0 to 4 Likert scale using a question about perceived level of knowledge on respiratory precautions. The actual knowledge score was calculated by combining the following elements: the mode of transmission of infectious agents, the usefulness of hand hygiene, and the recommendation of the handwashing and droplet precautions. The attitudes section was rated using a modified visual analogue scale from 0 to 8 and evaluated the fear of acquiring infection respiratory, beliefs on effective protection by mask, and barriers to use of mask. In addition, vaccination against influenza in the year of the study was assessed. To verify the quality of the questionnaire, the clarity of the questions, and the length of the latter, we conducted a 10subject pretest on a population of medical students and nurses and subsequently reconstructed some of our questions.",

Bias because of the voluntary response may also affect our results. The overall response to the questionnaire was only 61% and could have resulted in a selection bias for workers being knowledgeable and feeling more concerned by the infection control. However, it is reassuring that obtained participation rate was slightly higher than in other similar studies. [26] [27] [28] We showed a difference of actual compliance between the 2 hospital sites that was not perceived by the employees. Again, this may relate to overestimation of compliance in the questionnaire. The actual difference in compliance between the 2 institutions may be due to the local culture of each hospital, including the strengthening of prevention practices. 22 At site 1, we noted significantly reduced compliance, and, in this same location, the inaccessibility of the required respiratory hygiene material (masks and tissues) was noted on the questionnaire as an obstacle to mask wearing. This is consistent with clear evidence in the literature between the accessibility of the equipment and the observance of a practice. 29 Surprisingly, we also found a difference in actual knowledge between our 2 sites. This may be due to a disparity in the quality of training or an unknown difference between populations. In keeping with recent American data, 26 only 25.3% of our workers received infection prevention training in the last year. Given that literature reports a correlation between the rate of training and observance, 19 we again have difficulty explaining the low actual compliance.",
