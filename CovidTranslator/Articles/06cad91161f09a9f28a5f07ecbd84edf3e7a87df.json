Respirable pathogen-carrying droplets provide a vector for the spatial spread of infection with droplet transport determined by diffusive and convective processes. An epidemiological model describing the spatial dynamics of disease transmission is presented. The effects of an ambient airflow, as an infection control, are incorporated leading to a delay equation, with droplet density dependent on the infectious density at a previous time. It is found that small droplets ( $ 0:4 mm) generate a negligible infectious force due to the small viral load and the associated duration they require to transmit infection. In contrast, larger droplets ( $ 4 mm) can lead to an infectious wave propagating through a fully susceptible population or a secondary infection outbreak for a localized susceptible population. Droplet diffusion is found to be an inefficient mode of droplet transport leading to minimal spatial spread of infection. A threshold air velocity is derived, above which disease transmission is impaired even when the basic reproduction number R 0 exceeds unity.",

Large-scale geographic models are typically implemented by superimposing a transportation network on local infection dynamics (Keeling and Rohani, 2002; Colizza et al., 2006) . Smaller scale models often implement reaction-diffusion equations to describe random movements within populations (Noble, 1974; Murray et al., 1986 ). Such models have been shown to exhibit traveling-wave solutions whose existence depends on the basic reproduction number R 0 (K\u00e4ll\u00e9 n et al., 1985; Mendez, 1998) . However, few models address the mode of disease transmission that underlies the spatial dynamics.",

All three modes result from the generation of respiratory droplets by an infected person during an expiratory event (e.g. coughing, sneezing). Droplet and contact transmission require relatively close contact between the infected and susceptible individuals for efficient disease transmission. Therefore, spatial spread via these routes of transmission must be driven by human movement. In contrast, the airborne spread of a pathogen may be attributed to the movement of both people and fine aerosol droplets suspended in the air and their associated airborne residence time and pathogen load. Furthermore, the airborne route is the primary mode of transmission for other respiratory diseases, such as tuberculosis, and its contribution to the spatial spread of infection is of paramount importance.",

            "text": "A zero-dimensional model for the temporal development of an epidemic driven by expiratory droplets (in particular, respirable droplets) was developed in Stilianakis and Drossinos (2010) . The model is built on the concept of an infectious cloud surrounding each infected individual, an idea also considered in Eichenwald et al. (1960) . In this work we investigate the airborne spread of an infection in a closed spatial environment within which the human population is confined for a prolonged period of time. For example, such outbreaks have been documented in public settings including prisons (Awofeso et al., 2001; G\u00f3 mez-Pintado et al., 2010) , boarding schools (Rose, 1980) , long-term care facilities (Dharan et al., 2009 ) and on board large cruise ships (Miller et al., 2000; Ward et al., 2010) . In the absence of intervention measures, such outbreaks can persist for many weeks. We extend the zero-dimensional model to include the spatial dynamics of airborne-droplet transmission (also known as aerosol transmission) and investigate how an ambient airflow can influence disease spread. Accordingly, we neglect transmission by droplet spray, a close-contact transmission mode that occurs via direct deposition onto a susceptible's mucous membranes, and by (physical) contact transmission. Furthermore, we consider transmission only by respirable expiratory droplets, droplets whose post-evaporation diameter is less than 10 mm, neglecting transmission by inspirable droplets, droplets whose post-evaporation diameter is between 10 and 100 mm. We follow Nicas et al. (2005) and take the droplet post-evaporation diameter to be half the preevaporation diameter. Inspirable droplets contribute to disease transmission by inhalation almost immediately after generation (e.g., during the first breath) as they are considerably larger than respirable droplets and they gravitationally settle very fast. As in the case of droplet spray, transmission by inspirable droplets occurs only at close contact.",

            "text": "where the minus sign is interpreted as the tendency of people to move from high density areas to low density areas and D p is the diffusivity of the human population. For real world situations, movement of the general population might also be modeled by including a convective term, whereby human motion would be faster and in a specified direction. However, movement in such facilities as prisons and long-term care facilities is more restricted and sporadic and a diffusive flux better models such a scenario. In addition, restricting movement to a diffusive process is more convenient to investigate if droplets can drive the transmission process. The droplet flux Q D depends on environmental characteristics. Droplets are generated through expiratory events (e.g. coughing, sneezing) with an initial velocity. Average expiration velocities are 11.7 ms \u00c0 1 and 3.9 ms \u00c0 1 for coughing and speaking respectively . For respirable droplets, the droplet relaxation time, the time required to adjust the droplet velocity to a new condition of forces, is of the order $ 10 \u00c07 \u00c010 \u00c04 s. Therefore, the droplet velocity rapidly tends to the carrier-gas (air) velocity. The exhaled air flow has been modeled as a continuous turbulent round jet (Wang et al., 2005; Parienta et al., 2011) . For a steady-state turbulent jet, small droplets, which follow the instantaneous fluid streamlines, may reach relatively large distances from the source (more than 8 m after 100 s). However, it was argued in Zhu et al. (2006) , where the air flow within a calm room was calculated via a Computational Fluid Dynamics software, that droplets smaller than 30 mm diameter would disperse within the room without significant influence of gravity or inertia. Accordingly, we consider that the initial velocity of the exhaled respirable droplets is the underlying fluid velocity, namely either the ambient air velocity or zero in its absence. For convenience, we henceforth refer to the ambient airflow as the ventilation. This airflow could be naturally induced (e.g. a draft through an open window) or be the result of an artificial indoor ventilation system. It follows that, in an enclosed space with no ventilation, airborne droplets will be transported by molecular diffusion alone and Q D \u00bc \u00c0D d @D=@x, where D d is the molecular droplet diffusivity. Molecular (Brownian) diffusivity may be safely ignored for droplets larger than 0:5 mm diameter. We retain it in the formal derivation of the flux equations to allow the simulation of nanodroplets, to allow for turbulent droplet diffusion in the presence of an external turbulent flow, and to render the numerical solution of the parabolic differential equations stable. In a ventilated environment airborne droplets will also be convected by the ambient airflow. The appropriate flux is Q D \u00bc vD\u00c0D d @D=@x, where D d is the turbulent diffusivity, and v the average, constant air ventilation velocity. The onedimensional droplet flux is an idealized approximation. In reality, the air flow is unlikely to be at a constant unidirectional velocity, and ventilation may simply mix droplet and air particles around within the domain. A higher dimensional spatial model is required to describe such complex flow characteristics. However, the onedimensional model can be a good approximation for environments where air is predominantly in one direction, for example a draft of air blowing through a room.",

Gravitational settling rates are size dependent and we take y d 1 \u00bc 28:8 per day and y d 2 \u00bc 0:39 per day (Drossinos and Housiadas, 2006) . This implies that, in the absence of other removal processes, a droplet with diameter d 1 \u00bc 4 mm will settle under gravity in a tranquil environment in approximately 50 min. Decreasing the droplet diameter by an order of magnitude results in the droplet remaining airborne for approximately 2.56 days. The pathogen inactivation rate m p , assumed to be independent of size, is taken to be 8.64 per day (Hemmes et al., 1960 ) and a droplet is effectively removed through pathogen inactivation in under 3 h. Therefore, pathogen inactivation is a crucial process for the removal of smaller droplets that could, theoretically, take days to settle under gravity alone. Taking both gravitational settling and pathogen inactivation processes into account, droplets remain airborne and infectious for 38.5 min (d 1 ) and 2.66 h (d 2 ). The inclusion of removal through inhalation, the last term on the right-hand-side of Eq. Droplet diffusivity will depend on the presence or absence of ventilation. In an unventilated environment, with v % 0 m s \u00c01 , the molecular diffusivity of droplets is calculated as D d 1 \u00bc 6:2 \u00c2 10 \u00c012 m 2 s \u00c01 and D d 2 \u00bc 8:34 \u00c2 10 \u00c011 m 2 s \u00c01 (Drossinos and Housiadas, 2006) . For an air-conditioned environment with standard wall-mounted air-conditioners a typical airflow velocity is v\u00bc0.2 m s \u00c0 1 (Zhu et al., 2006) and we take this to be constant throughout the entire domain. Under such conditions the flow will invariably be turbulent and the droplet diffusivity will be several orders of magnitude larger. We estimate the turbulent diffusivity of both droplet classes to be D tur d \u00bc 10 \u00c03 m 2 s \u00c01 . Human diffusivity, motion, can be crudely estimated from D p % x 2 =t, where x is a characteristic distance traveled in a time t. For the spatial spread of a disease through a geographically open population typical distances traveled per hour are in the range 18-42 m (Noble, 1974; Bertuzzo et al., 2010; Lou and Zhao, 2011) . We expect that movement would be more restricted in a closed environment, for example a prison or long-term care facility, and we estimate that people diffuse approximately 10 m per hour yielding D p % 10 \u00c05 m 2 s \u00c01 . Intuitively, we estimate the spatial size of such environments to be of the order 10 3 m and fix our domain length at l \u00bc2000 m.",

The dynamics are described by three different timescales (Table 1) , two of which, t r (droplet removal time scale) and t d (droplet diffusion time scale), are dependent on droplet size. The convective timescale t c represents the time it takes for the ambient airflow to carry the droplet the entire length of the domain. If l is of the order of 10 1 \u00c010 3 m then typical convection times are t c \u00bc O\u00f010 2 \u00c010 4 \u00de s and, clearly, convection is a fast process relative to the disease dynamics with t c 5 t t . Intuitively, this implies that lower ventilation velocities, which increase the convection time t c , result in greater disease transmission. The droplet-removal (droplet infectivity) time scale is the inverse of the size-dependent droplet removal rate a d with t r \u00f0d 1 \u00de % 38:46 min and t r \u00f0d 2 \u00de % 2:66 h. Thus, since t r \u00f0d 1 \u00de o t r \u00f0d 2 \u00de we have that n d 1 on d 2 and convection effects, for a constant airventilation velocity, are stronger for smaller droplets since they remain airborne longer and can be carried further from their point of origin. Furthermore, n is inversely proportional to the length l and convection will thus exert greater influence on droplet dynamics over shorter domains as droplets will be rapidly transported the entire length of the domain.",

            "text": "In an unventilated environment, with n \u00bc 0, the spatial spread of disease will solely depend on the diffusion of people or droplets. Droplet diffusion is a slow process, for example a 4 mm droplet will diffuse approximately 5.7 mm while airborne. In the same time a person could diffuse over 7 m. Therefore, the spatial spread of disease will be driven by the diffusion of people as droplets are essentially stationary relative to the human population. Mathematically, this observation follows immediately from the inequality Z d 5Z p . We first consider the disease spread when a localized infected density is introduced to a uniformly distributed susceptible population. We find that, for small times (t $ 5 % 3 h), droplet density rapidly increases until D\u00f0x,t\u00de % I\u00f0x,t\u00de and subsequently droplets and infected dynamics are indistinguishable. This occurs once droplet generation and removal processes are essentially balanced. This indicates that there is no separation between droplets and infected individuals and close contact is required for efficient transmission. At larger times the localized infectious peak is observed to grow in amplitude, Fig. 2(a) . An outbreak in a closed population could be expected to persist for many weeks. However, times in excess of t \u00bc 2000 % 53 days are unrealistic for an influenza epidemic. At such times the model predicts the formation of two infectious traveling pulses, propagating in opposite directions. Accordingly, the density of susceptibles evolves into a wave front slowly infiltrating the completely susceptible population ahead of the front, Fig. 2(b) . There are several reasons why this behavior is observed. Firstly, the idealized case of a homogeneous population, where the infected population is surrounded by a constant source of susceptibles is uncharacteristic of a true human population distribution. In the absence of susceptible individuals the density of infected individuals would rapidly decay, Fig. 3 . Secondly, once an outbreak is identified within the closed population, interventions such as isolation, quarantine or treatment would be imposed to limit the impact of the outbreak. Diffusion models used to describe the larger scale geographic spread of disease display such traveling wave behavior, with transportation networks simulated using larger diffusion coefficients and timescales of the order of years being considered (Noble, 1974; Murray et al., 1986) .",

As before, the droplet density rapidly approaches the density of infected individuals and the two densities are thereafter indistinguishable from each other. We find that, even with very close contact between the two groups, diffusion is too slow a process to effectively transmit infection. In the absence of a susceptible population, and since Z p 5 1, the density of infectious individuals at any point x \u00bc x 0 will decay via I\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc I 0 \u00f0x 0 \u00dee \u00c0lt -0 as t-1. The lifetime of the infected population is thus 1=l which (dimensionally) corresponds to the disease infectivity time scale t i of 5 days. The infected population recovers before diffusion has time to effectively transmit the infection, t i 5t p . To conclude, in the absence of an ambient airflow, diffusion is an inefficient mechanism for the spatial spread of disease which will, presumably, be driven by contact and droplet transmission during close contact events.",

However, we emphasize that this is an approximate value obtained for the relatively small diffusion of people and neglecting the possibility of contact and/or droplet transmission. In addition, the true air velocity will depend on the distance from the ventilation source, with larger velocities closer to the source. The unstable evolution of an arbitrary perturbation when v \u00bc0.01 m s \u00c0 1 is shown in Fig. 5 . An infectious pulse can be seen to propagate through the susceptible population in the direction of positive air flow. Droplet and infected densities are qualitatively similar and only slightly out of phase with each other, with droplets propagating ahead of the infectious pulse. Dynamically this implies that, for small air velocities, the dynamics of droplets and infectious individuals are closely coupled and only separate from each other at sufficiently high velocities. Finally, we consider the spatial transmission of infection resulting from a heterogeneous initial population distribution, where infected and susceptible populations are placed at separate locations in the domain, Fig. 6 . For small times, t $ 10 % 6 h, the infected population generate droplets which are subsequently transported in the direction of positive air flow. A secondary curve for infectious individuals forms when droplets encounter the susceptible population, t \u00bc 100 % 2:5 days. At later times these secondary cases produce droplets of their own and a secondary peak in the droplet curve can be observed, t \u00bc 500 % 13 days. The amplitude of the secondary curve for infectious individuals is obviously influenced by the initial distance between the infectious and susceptible populations. At large times, t \u00bc 1000 % 26 days, it is clear that the amplitudes of both curves for infectious individuals decay. This behavior results from the decay of the initial infectious population through recovery and the subsequent reduction in droplets being convected towards the susceptible region. This demonstrates that it is possible for infection to occur in the absence of an infected population and purely as the result of the airborne non-diffusive transport of aerosol droplets.",

Two droplet diameter values, d 1 \u00bc 4 mm and d 2 \u00bc 0:4 mm, were considered that are representative of experimentally determined droplet size distributions. Droplet dynamics are governed by generation and removal processes, the latter being dominated by gravitational settling and pathogen inactivation. Inactivation is a particularly crucial removal process for smaller droplets that could remain airborne for days. Smaller droplets are found to be a weak disease vector. Their relatively large generation rates do not result in greater transmission due to the small viral load and the associated duration required to transmit infection. Transmission is, thus, dominated by the larger droplets.",

In the homogeneous scenario and for long time scales, the model displays the classic infectious wave propagating through a susceptible population, following an initial transient state until a balance is achieved between droplet generation and removal processes.
