            "text": "The Hajj, an annual mass gathering of Muslim pilgrims, is known for its high morbidity and mortality rates. However, pregnant women sometimes participate in this pilgrimage, despite guidelines that discourage such an undertaking due to potential fetomaternal complications. This study aimed to evaluate fetomaternal outcomes among pregnant Indian Hajj pilgrims. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at two Indian Hajj Medical Mission (IHMM)-affiliated secondary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia during the Hajj periods of August-October 2015 and 2016 and July-September 2017. All female Indian pilgrims of reproductive age who underwent pregnancy screening at secondary care IHMM hospitals during this period were included in the study. Definitive obstetric care was provided at the Makkah Maternity & Child Hospital. Data regarding the pilgrims' obstetric characteristics, antenatal complications, management and fetomaternal outcomes were evaluated. Results: A total of 114 pregnant Indian pilgrims were identified during the study period. The most common antenatal complications were respiratory tract infections (51.75%), followed by iron deficiency anaemia (17.54%), hyperemesis gravidarum (14.04%), hypothyroidism (9.65%) and gestational diabetes mellitus (5.26%). There were 20 vaginal deliveries (17.54%), two Caesarean sections (1.75%) and 32 abortions (28.07%). The cumulative three-year birth rate was 24.60 per 1,000 females. Conclusion: During Hajj, pregnant pilgrims have a high risk of abortion, respiratory tract infections and various antenatal, perinatal and neonatal complications which may go unreported or untreated. Women should therefore be educated regarding the risk of adverse fetomaternal outcomes which may occur while undertaking a Hajj pilgrimage during pregnancy.",

            "text": "T he Hajj is an annual Muslim pilgrimage of more than 2.3 million people from all over the world. 1 Hajj forms one of the five pillars of Islam and is obligatory for all able-bodied men and women of requisite means. 2 Muslims consider Hajj to be the most important pilgrimage for spiritual enlightenment during their lifetime. However, the pilgrimage involves physically demanding rituals which take place over approximately 45 days in the desert climate of Saudi Arabia, sometimes without adequate nourishment, hydration or sufficient rest. 2 Furthermore, Hajj is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality due to various factors, including old age, chronic diseases, infectious disease outbreaks, accidents and disasters, all of which require appropriate surveillance and emergency response systems. [3] [4] [5] Mass gathering medicine is challenging due to the increased transmission of communicable diseases, limited healthcare accessibility, the often overwhelming number of patients and difficulties in evacuating patients during emergencies. Healthcare during Hajj is also affected by pilgrim diversity and vulnerability, despite yearly efforts to augment resources and enhance preparedness. [6] [7] [8] While the Holy Quran does not prohibit performing Hajj during pregnancy and air travel during this time is considered safe, the governments of several countries actively discourage women from undertaking Hajj while pregnant. [9] [10] [11] [12] Nevertheless, pregnant women regularly undertake this arduous journey, sometimes in the belief that giving birth in the holy cities of Makkah or Medina will confer spiritual benefit. Such pregnancies are often not declared and remain largely undetected prior to departure for Hajj. 10 The Indian Hajj Medical Mission (IHMM) caters to pregnant Indian women during their pilgrimage before transferring them to Saudi Arabian state-sponsored hospitals for appropriate fetomaternal care. 7, 8 The IHMM comprises a multi-tier network of medical outreach teams, mobile medical task forces, primary care clinics, tent clinics and two secondary care hospitals with 30-40 beds each. In addition, the IHMM has referral and evacuation capabilities in Makkah, Medina and Jeddah. 7, 8 To the best of the authors' knowledge, no data have yet been reported in the literature regarding pregnancy and neonatal outcomes during Hajj or in comparable mass gathering settings. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant Indian Hajj pilgrims over a three-year period from 2015-2017.",

In Saudi Arabia, maternal and child healthcare is sponsored for foreign Hajj pilgrims, which may tempt those who reside in countries where adequate obstetric and neonatal care is not accessible or affordable.",

Although most viral pathogens cause limited morbidity in healthy adults, they can pose significant risks to both mother and fetus during pregnancy. 17, 18 Cardiorespiratory compromise can adversely affect maternal haemodynamic stability, thereby affecting fetal nourishment. 19 In addition, viruses which are transmitted transplacentally can cause fetal viraemia, leading to multiorgan infections. 20 This is particularly worrying as the detection of such infections is limited in mass gathering settings. 21 Furthermore, the clinical presentation of certain respiratory infections may be non-specific, especially in cases of seasonal influenza and H1N1, thus increasing the burden of laboratory testing. During Hajj, the Saudi Arabian healthcare system has limited resources at its disposal, particularly when it comes to the sophisticated molecular tests required for the diagnosis and identification of novel respiratory pathogens. [21] [22] [23] While there are operational stringencies in place for the isolation of suspected cases of infection, there are no approved antiviral drugs for treating novel respiratory pathogens-the teratogenic effects of which would need to be assessed in any case-nor available guidelines for their specific monitoring, prognosis or follow-up. 21 Moreover, hospitalisation can further increase the transmission of respiratory pathogens. 24 Unfortunately, sociolinguistic and ethnocultural differences are barriers to proposed measures aiming to help prevent the transmission of respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims.",

Pilgrims routinely perform physically demanding religious rituals including tawaf (circumambulating the Kaaba) and sa'i (a religious ritual involving walking for long distances) along with trips to Mina, Muzdalifah and Arafat, often without eating or drinking properly or getting sufficient rest. Pregnancy can negatively affect the physiological status of the mother due to the increasing demands of the growing fetus. Physical exhaustion can lead to contractions of the lower abdomen, backaches, physical injuries and physiological compromise. 25 However, there is an incr-e360 | SQU Medical Journal, August 2018, Volume 18, Issue 3 easing body of evidence that women who participate in sustained and vigorous physical activity in the first and second trimester, such as high-performance sports and endurance training, have successful fetomaternal outcomes. [25] [26] [27] Nevertheless, pregnant pilgrims run the risk of the spontaneous onset of labour during Hajj rituals, resulting in unattended delivery. Furthermore, other complications like anaemia, pre-eclampsia, GDM and hypothyroidism can have adverse fetomaternal outcomes. Such complications require on-site antenatal management which may not be readily accessible; moreover, transportation to other facilities may not be possible due to overcrowding. 7, 8 Generally, pregnant women who travel for extended periods of time are likely to miss out on opportunities for breast feeding counselling, family planning, neonatal care and antenatal surveillance to detect gynaecological comorbidities.",

In addition, they should do their best to avoid crowds, wear comfortable clothes and shoes and maintain proper nutrition, hydration, rest and exercise. 28 Adverse symptoms like bleeding, abdominal contractions, headaches and watery vaginal discharge should be immediately reported. Moreover, pregnant women should avoid excessive physical effort during Hajj rituals and take advantage of allowances, such as using a wheelchair during tawaf and sa'i. Patients should also declare known pregnancies or their intention to conceive during Hajj to the Saudi Arabian medical authorities, thereby enabling the adequate provision of antenatal care.
