The central role of modelling is to estimate the basic reproduction number, R 0 , defined as the expected average number of secondary cases infected by a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population, as well as the effective reproduction number, R t , defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case during an epidemic. Different approaches [6, 7] have been taken for the purpose. A study on COVID-19 in Wuhan [8] is also reported. In rapid development of an infectious disease like COVID-19 in China and in the world, however, these approaches are very difficult in use, if not impossible, or lack of accuracy.",

We define the number of cumulative removed cases (R) as R = C + D, and the number of current infectives (I) as I = A \u2212 R.

For various reasons, reported numbers of cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei are comparatively less reliable. Particularly, there is a jump on February 12, seeing Figure 1 and Table 1 , due to the addition of clinically diagnosed cases (only applicable to Hubei province) to previously laboratory confirmed cases. On the other hand, numbers of cumulative confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths of other provinces on the Chinese mainland are quite reliable since January 20 when the National Health Commission started to daily report the epidemic situation.

The model depends purely on statistic data of categorised epidemic cases reported in public. We apply the model to the emergence of COVID-19 in China. Although the model is not yet perfect, it is effective, robust and consistent as long as there is no sudden change in control measures. Comparing with the classic SIR model, we extract the basic reproduction number, R 0 , and make predictions on the time when the effective reproduction number will become less than one and on the total number of confirmed cases in the end. Our study indicates that it is essential to take effective control measures as early as possible for curbing an infectious disease and it is important to report epidemic data precisely and timely for epidemiological modelling. In the era of globalisation, an infectious disease can spread as far as any individual can reach on the earth, that makes the whole world population to be susceptible. As COVID-19 has spread around the world, we anticipate our method can be adapted in modelling the spread and help public health authorities make policy decisions.",
