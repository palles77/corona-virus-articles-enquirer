It thus bears obligations under Article 12 of the covenant to take appropriate measures at the domestic level to realize the right to health in China. Accountability is an important component of the right to health. This article examines whether the Western concept of accountability, recently imported into China, has the potential to improve the protection of the right to health within China's existing political, legal, and cultural framework. In so doing, it reviews current Chinese institutional mechanisms and considers the use of less formal mechanisms by which duty-bearers might be held accountable in China. More specifically, this article provides an overview of a range of health-related accountability mechanisms, including judicial, political, administrative, professional, and social accountability arrangements. It concludes that although there is the basis of an accountability framework for the right to health in China, the effective operation of accountability mechanisms is hindered by longstanding cultural and political barriers.",

            "text": "On August 23, 2016, Philip Alston, the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, issued a statement at the end of his mission in China. Alston noted the extraordinary progress that China has made over the past three decades in bringing people out of poverty. In particular, he reported that \"[i]n 2003, only 10% of the population had health insurance\" whereas \" [b] y 2013, some 95% were covered, including most of the rural poor and vulnerable urban groups.\" 1 Additionally, between 2000 and 2012, the infant mortality rate fell by 60% and the maternal mortality rate fell by 49%, and between 1990 and 2012, life expectancy increased from 69 to 75 years. Alston, accordingly, concluded that there were lessons for other countries to be drawn from China's achievements. Significantly, he declared that \"genuine political will to alleviate poverty is arguably the most important ingredient of all.\" 2 On the other hand, Alston reported a number of challenges for economic and social rights, in particular the lack of genuine accountability mechanisms to enable rights-holders to seek remedies for violations of their human rights. The absence of \"effective options for seeking redress or letting steam off,\" he noted, often leads to violence both by and against petitioners and protesters. 3 Accordingly, the development of effective domestic mechanisms of accountability in China is a crucial issue. In this context, this article provides an overview of accountability mechanisms in China, focusing on the right to health specifically and revealing where such mechanisms are lacking and how they might be improved. Accountability may involve a broad range of mechanisms-such as litigation, elections, public hearings, town meetings, professional oversight, social actions, and media reports-and China is a large and complex country. The article, therefore, does not attempt to provide a comprehensive review and does not examine any particular mechanism in depth. Nonetheless, the overview and analysis have implications for accountability for the right to health and all economic and social rights in China.",

            "text": "China ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in 2001 and \"has consistently emphasized its commitment to guaranteeing these rights\" in its National Human Rights Action Plans. 4 Article 12 of the ICESCR recognizes the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (often referred to simply as the right to health). 5 It also establishes the obligations of states parties to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right to health by, for example, providing for infant and child health, improving environmental conditions and workplace safety, preventing epidemics and occupational diseases, and ensuring health care for all. Under Article 12, states parties are required to respect, protect, and fulfill the right to health, including the right to health care and the underlying determinants of health-such as nutritious food, potable water, and safe housing-by taking concrete and targeted steps to progressively realize the right. 6 Fulfilling these obligations involves complex processes and efforts on the part of the state. For example, it requires that the state implement a non-discriminatory and effective health system; that it guarantee the availability and accessibility of clean water and essential medicines; and much more. 7 Many state actors are involved in implementing these processes. In terms of the right to health, these actors constitute duty-bearers. Supervising and monitoring the actions of these actors in relation to their duties is essential. In this way, these duty-bearers can be held accountable if they fail to fulfill their respective obligations and responsibilities, or if they abuse their powers. Accountability is an important component in the realization of the right to health, and accountability mechanisms play crucial roles in the supervisory process required to enhance the realization of this right. 8 As this Western idea of accountability is a newly imported concept in China, this article examines how far, if at all, institutional norms and structures of accountability have been absorbed into or transformed to fit the existing Chinese legal, political, and cultural frameworks. In so doing, it reviews current Chinese institutional mechanisms and considers the use of less formal mechanisms by which duty-bearers might be held accountable for the right to health. More specifically, the article discusses judicial accountability, political accountability, administrative accountability, professional accountability, and social accountability. In short, it explores whether the Western concept of accountability has the potential to improve the protection of the right to health within China. The article concludes that there is a domestic accountability framework-although very different from that of Western democracies-operating at various levels in China with some capacity to protect the right to health. Nonetheless, this accountability framework involves largely top-down processes and fails to provide adequate avenues for rights-holders to complain and to seek remedies for violations of their rights. 9",

            "text": "Accountability for the right to health Accountability is a key component of human rights, including the right to health. In General Comment 9 on the domestic application of the covenant, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the body responsible for monitoring implementation of the covenant, stressed that the central obligation of states parties in relation to the ICESCR is to ensure that the rights recognized by the covenant are fulfilled. 10 Although the ICESCR adopts a flexible approach that enables governments to take into account the particularities of their own legal and administrative systems, governments must nonetheless use all the means at their disposal to realize the rights recognized in the covenant. 11 Accountability is crucial to ensuring that states parties meet their obligations under the covenant. Governments are required to provide appropriate means of redress to aggrieved rights-holders. 12 There are many types of accountability mechanisms, including judicial, quasi-judicial, administrative, political, and social mechanisms. 13 While the type may vary, the purpose of each mechanism is to ensure that governments are answerable for their actions or inactions regarding the right to health and that rights-holders have effective remedies when their rights have been violated. 14 There are a number of potential remedies for violations of the right to health. Restitution, compensation, and rehabilitation focus on addressing impacts of rights violations on individual right-holders or groups of rights-holders. 15 Satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition are remedies aimed at addressing rights violations at the systemic level. 16 Importantly, accountability is \"sometimes narrowly understood to mean blame and punishment, whereas it is more accurately regarded as a process to determine what is working (so it can be repeated) and what is not (so it can be adjusted).\" 17 In this sense, accountability for human rights also hinges on the notion of participation of people and groups in all health-related decision making. Governments ensure one kind of participation through the creation of accountability mechanisms and effective remedies. 18 In addition, individuals and groups are entitled to participate in meaningful ways in the development and design of health policies and in monitoring and evaluating the implementation of these policies. 19 In order to ensure avenues for meaningful participation, governments must create fair and transparent processes that are accessible to and inclusive of diverse groups. 20 Participation methods vary but could include regional or national conferences, local health committees, focus groups, budgetary oversight, and public meetings. 21 Effective monitoring and evaluation by government, civil society, and rights-holders also requires transparency. Governments have an obligation to provide the public with information about their efforts to realize the right to health. 22 Continuous monitoring of efforts and outcomes serves a number of purposes. First, it provides governments with valuable information about the impact of their efforts. 23 Second, it provides rights-holders with information they need to participate meaningfully in health-related decision making and to hold their government accountable for realizing the right to health. 24 Accountability mechanisms for the right to health in China The exact term \"accountability\" (wen ze) was first introduced into the Chinese political system in 2003. 25 The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome",

The newly adopted Western concept of accountability has the potential to play an important role in structuring mechanisms and systems that can be applied to various aspects of the right to health, such as policymaking, professional administration, and health care delivery. Accordingly, the concept of accountability presents a primary tool for translating abstract principles into specific standards for measuring progress and for developing efficient laws, policies, institutions, procedures, and mechanisms that ensure the delivery of entitlements and redress for rights-holders. 29 In this context, this article provides an overview of the evolving framework of accountability relevant to the right to health in China. It addresses five categories of accountability: (1) judicial accountability, the traditional human rights mechanism; (2) political accountability, including participation, as it plays a crucial role in justifying policy decisions; (3) administrative accountability, as health policies and strategies are carried out largely by administrative organs; (4) professional accountability, as quality health services must be delivered by qualified health professionals; and (5) social accountability due to the special value system in Chinese society.",

Although the original purpose of these laws was not s. qiu and g. macnaughton / papers, 279-292 to protect health as a human right, some aspects of the right to health have been indirectly protected in courts through litigation under these laws. Such health-related judicial cases have increased in recent years. One example is China's first public interest litigation on air pollution, initiated by the All-China Environment Federation, which was adjudicated in July 2016. The Dezhou Intermediate Court found that the defendant's air emission from its factory did not meet national standards and ordered the defendant to pay 21 million RMB (about US$3 million) to the government for air reparation. 36 Additionally, individuals have been surprisingly successful in contract lawsuits against commercial insurers for the denial of benefits and in malpractice claims against hospitals for the poor quality of health care provided. 37 While courts may hold these market participants to market norms, they have been less effective in holding state actors to account. 38 Moreover, as Christina Ho notes, \"[l]itigation is a relatively weak tool in China.\" 39 Because courts are expensive and answerable to political bodies, among other reasons, people often prefer alternatives such as mediation and arbitration. 40 Further, in keeping with the desire to maintain a \"harmonious society,\" the government has also preferred mediation over litigation and has encouraged courts \"to meet quotas for successfully mediated cases.\" 41 As a result of this pressure to pursue mediation, people may also be steered away from litigating in the courts. 42",

The right to health requires the government to set up an appropriate health system and remedy market failures through both regulation and resource allocation. A central concern of the right to health is participation in the development of laws, policies, and practices to realize the right to health. This concept of political accountability has its roots in Western democratic political systems, where it is understood that political accountability requires mass participation by individuals. 43 Whether meaningful political accountability can be achieved with a single party government like that in China is, as Alston states, \"[t]he most difficult and complex challenge.\" 44 Generally speaking, political accountability demands a democratic political framework carried out through mechanisms such as free and fair elections and the workings of parliaments; thereby, the party in power may be removed if it fails to satisfy the public. 45 By contrast, however, in China there is only one party governing the country. Nevertheless, political accountability in the broader Western sense is not entirely absent. In theory, the National People's Congress provides a mechanism similar to a parliament by which political power is monitored. According to the Constitution, the National People's Congress plays the legislative role, and the State Council, which practices executive and administrative power, is authorized and supervised by the National People's Congress. 46 The State Council is directly accountable to the National People's Congress for all its decisions and actions. In relation to the right to health, three forms of political accountability are reflected in the Chinese political system. These include accountability of the National People's Congress, which concerns supervision of political power in the process of decision making; accountability of the State Council, which concerns the use of available resources and the equal allocation of resources for the right to health; and accountability within the Communist Party, which has a unique form with particular Chinese characteristics.",

Moreover, this form of political accountability is rendered less effective by the fact that it is activated by the government rather than rights-holders. There is no procedure for rights-holders to trigger a process of accountability other than indirectly-for example, by reporting transgressions to the media.

However, if the national people's representatives are not satisfied with the report, or find that a distribution was not in compliance with the adopted policy, there are no concrete remedies available other than to criticize and request further review. 59 This creates a dilemma in that there is no effective mechanism to hold the State Council accountable for poor performance. The public is not able to obtain remedies for the council's failure to implement the approved governmental plan. Given that further revisions can be requested of the council, accountability functions well insofar as it relates to government planning, but it does not function for the review of performance, as no remedy or sanction is available if there is a failure.",

Each health authority is accountable to its corresponding government at the same level; and hospitals are accountable to the corresponding health department at that level. In this way, the government control system aims to ensure that health policies and plans are effectively enforced, especially in times of public health emergencies. Yet, the complex multilevel system often results in several governmental entities with overlapping responsibilities and functions for the same health issues. Beyond the health care authorities, the Ministry of Health also plays a role in monitoring and supervising a number of other actors through regulatory monitoring and enforcement. These actors include public health care providers at the central, regional, and local levels, as well as private health care providers. As an executive body, the Ministry of Health is not simply called on in its own right to meet accountability requirements but also demands accountability from other organs. Policy making and monitoring: For the purpose of policymaking and monitoring, transparency regarding information on budgets, regulations, quality of performance, achievement of targets, and so on is crucial. Paul Hunt, former UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health, recommended that states use a human rights-based approach to health indicators to assess the progressive realization of the right to health, the effectiveness of health policy, and the participation of individuals and groups in the development, implementation, and review of health policy. 64 This approach, however, has generally not been reflected in China's policymaking, implementation, and review process until recently. It is only in the past 10 years that the government has moved toward increasing transparency and public participation in health policymaking. 65 Government agencies at the national and local levels have published draft laws and regulations for public comment, and in some cases have considered the comments. 66 Nonetheless, China's move toward transparency and participation is not yet reflected in its monitoring of implementation of health policy. Notably, in 2014, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognized the absence of reliable statistics in China that would allow an accurate assessment of China's fulfillment of these rights. 67 In his 2016 report, Alston also expressed concern about the lack of transparency in the data collection process, allegations that unfavorable data were not published, and the lack of disaggregated statistics, which are necessary to determine who is being left behind. 68 Complaints mechanisms: In clinical practice, when malpractice occurs, the patient has the choice of seeking a remedy from the administrative mechanism, relevant health authority, or the courts. Similarly, when a health authority fails to fulfill its duties, such as failing to grant quality health care to individuals, the individual may seek a remedy through administrative procedures, the government at the next higher level, or the courts. 69 In practice, seeking administrative accountability is relatively inexpensive compared to resorting to the courts, but it is generally not a fruitful option. 70 Indeed, many claimants are prevented by local authorities from complaining to higher levels of government about inaction or abuse at the local level. 71",

However, due to information asymmetries between health professionals and their patients, not every patient is able to judge whether services and treatment they receive meet professional standards and are the most suitable for their needs. Examination of the quality of health delivery requires professional knowledge. Therefore, professional accountability mechanisms must rely upon experts in health care or operate through associations with professional knowledge. 76 In some countries, professional associations supervise and monitor health professionals through licensing requirements and codes of conduct. In China, there are medical professional associations, such as the Chinese Medical Doctors Association (CMDA), but these organizations are not in charge of training and regulating health professionals or establishing standards for practice. According to the Medical Practitioners Act of 1999, the qualification of health professionals is managed by health authorities at each level, but with the assistance of medical associations.

It may also investigate medical disputes in hospitals through its regional sub-associations under the authority of the Medical Administration of the Ministry of Health. The CMDA has no authority to issue licenses or put professional restraints on medical practitioners. However, it is obliged to provide professional opinions if requested by judicial or administrative organs. Suspension from medical practice must be made by an administrative decision or court ruling. Thus, patients cannot remove health professionals from their positions by means of professional accountability through the CMDA. The CMDA simply assists the courts by providing professional opinions. Despite this interlocking system of accountability, there are important areas where professional accountability of health professionals is absent. Due to the economic reforms that started in 1978, hospitals are no longer funded solely by public revenue. Even public hospitals have been driven to chase revenue by charging fees. 77 In many hospitals, doctors' income is linked to the quantity of their work, which includes the quantity of operations they perform and the quantity of medicines they prescribe. It is also common for doctors to get rebates from pharmaceutical companies for prescribing their medicines to patients. Moreover, hospitals share rebates from pharmaceutical companies with doctors. 78 These incentives lead to the unnecessary overprescribing of medicines, which wastes medical resources and is harmful to the health of patients. Whether a prescription or treatment is suitable or necessary, however, is difficult for individual patients to assess. It is also difficult for individuals with no professional knowledge to provide sufficient evidence to hold health care providers accountable. In this light, professional accountability mechanisms in China are not effective due to immoral incentives, the knowledge and power imbalances between health professionals and patients, and the absence of effective complaint mechanisms.",

On finding that her colleagues were providing light quantum therapy by using unlicensed equipment on patients, which was harmful to their health, Dr. Chen wrote to the hospital's professional supervisory board. However, she did not get a satisfactory answer from the board; instead, she was dismissed from her position. She then wrote to the local professional supervisory office, but here too failed to get a satisfactory response. Next, she decided to turn to the judiciary. However, relevant regulations allow only patients and their families to sue a hospital for malpractice. 79 It thus became difficult for Dr. Chen to hold relevant duty-bearers to account. As a last resort, she decided to pretend to be a patient in order to expose the truth. Although she was a healthy person, the hospital still accepted her as a patient, immediately providing her with illegal treatment. Through her undercover action, Dr. Chen was finally able to collect evidence and file the case before a court. 80 Later, the media reported her story, which pressured the Shanghai Medicine Administration Office into initiating a special investigation on illegal treatments in all hospitals in Shanghai.",

            "text": "Despite China's ratification of the ICESCR, the right to health is not directly justiciable in Chinese courts. Nonetheless, it is partially justiciable through other health-related rights that are directly justiciable. Political accountability in China has traditionally been performed through the National People's Congress, through the reporting of the State Council, and through supervision mechanisms within the Communist Party. Although there is an identifiable framework of political accountability, lack of public participation has rendered it a very weak mechanism by which to hold the government to account. It has therefore recently come to be practiced in combination with a new process of public censure through the media. Additionally, in recent years, the government has started to explore other means of public participation, such as a 2008 pilot of an online feedback system that invited individuals to comment on ongoing health care reforms. 81 By contrast, administrative accountability can be used to monitor and supervise officials who perform delegated duties. This process can be achieved by government action or through administration litigation. Nonetheless, administrative accountability has often resulted from the publicity of some scandal rather through a systematic procedure. In response to the failures of administrative supervision and litigation, in 2017 the Chinese government began piloting \"powerful\" supervisory commissions in Beijing, Shanxi, and Zhejiang. 82 Further, although there are statutes and regulations on medical professional standards, there is no distinct professional accountability mechanism. People must rely on administrative or judicial mechanisms in cases of professional incompetency. Because of information asymmetry and the lack of oversight through professional medical associations, it is difficult, however, to hold health care providers accountable through these mechanisms. In short, professional accountability, like political accountability, does not function independently but works together with other forms of accountability.",
