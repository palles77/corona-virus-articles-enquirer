This decrease in mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 is temporally related to an increase in the use of antiretrovirals (for prophylaxis or for treatment) during pregnancy and in delivery by cesarean before labor and before ruptured membranes (elective cesarean delivery). The European mode of delivery trial randomized HIV-1-infected women to delivery at 38 weeks to avoid the onset of labor and successfully halved the risk of mother-to-child transmission. 1 Based on the results of this trial and of an individual patient data meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies in North America and Europe, 2 both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Public Health Service have issued guidelines indicating that elective cesarean delivery is recommended for HIV-1-infected pregnant women with peripheral blood viral loads greater than 1,000 copies/mL irrespective of antiretroviral regimen. 3, 4 From 1994 to 2000, cesarean delivery rates increased among HIV-1-infected women in the United States from 20% to 50%. 5 Data from the European Collaborative Study suggest there may be some benefit of elective cesarean delivery even in pregnancies in which the viral load is undetectable (200 copies/mL or lower, depending on clinical assay). 6 Elective cesarean delivery is likely to remain an important tool in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in the United States and elsewhere.",

All neonatal respiratory morbidity data were reviewed by two study clinicians (E.G.L. and J.S.R.). For this analysis, only diagnoses reported to have occurred within the first 28 days of life were reviewed. Supporting clinical data (clinical course, radiologic diagnosis, culture results, need for supplemental oxygen, use of surfactant) of coded pediatric diagnoses of respiratory morbidities defined as outcomes for this analysis were reviewed.

This suggests that frequently cesarean delivery was done as a result of physician or maternal preference.

            "text": "There are several strengths of this study. P1025 is a large U.S. cohort of HIV-1-infected pregnant women and their infants. Approximately 1,200 mother-infant pairs were available for this analysis. These women were delivered from 2002 to 2008, after American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists-endorsed cesarean delivery for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 among women with detectable or unknown viral loads. 3 Strengths of this analysis include the large number of participants with prospectively collected data and high rates of cesarean delivery. Weaknesses include a lack of randomization to mode of delivery and a reliance on clinical diagnoses by different clinicians at multiple sites. Randomization of mode of delivery is unlikely to be studied in large numbers as a result of cost. The diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome is a generally accepted diagnosis with clearly defined symptoms making diagnosis by different clinicians unlikely to have affected results. Although several studies have been undertaken to evaluate effectiveness of cesarean delivery to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 and potential maternal morbidity, this is the first study to evaluate neonatal respiratory morbidity according to mode of delivery. 32 Published studies of morbidity among neonates of HIV-1-infected women are generally limited to infectious complications or antiretroviral medication side effects. 6, 33 There have been no published analyses specifically addressing neonatal respiratory morbidity according to mode of delivery among HIV-1-infected women. The U.S. Public Health Service guidelines for HIV-1-infected pregnant women recommend that cesarean delivery be done at 38 weeks of gestation by best estimated gestational age without amniocentesis. The guidelines point out that although there is a substantial increase in the risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome with earlier cesarean deliveries, this increased risk must be balanced with the risk of onset of labor or rupture of membranes before 39 weeks of gestation. 4 More systematic data collection is needed on neonatal morbidity associated with interventions for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. For HIV-1infected pregnant women to make informed choices for themselves and their infants related to mode of delivery, they need information regarding both benefits and morbidities associated with cesarean delivery for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. Although neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is readily treatable, especially among nearterm infants, it contributes to the morbidity and expense associated with the procedure. 21 With modern management, long-term sequelae of respiratory distress syndrome generally would be unlikely except in the very preterm infant. 34 For that reason, the benefit of cesarean delivery for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 should be weighed against the potential morbidities for the neonate and the mother. Prevention of iatrogenic prematurity is essential if cesarean delivery is to remain an intervention to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. The mother with an HIV-1 viral load higher than 1,000 copies/mL may decrease her infant's risk of acquisition of HIV-1 infection from 6% to 2-3%. 1 The benefit of cesarean delivery for prevention of HIV-1 transmission with an undetectable viral load is unknown. If vertically transmitted, HIV-1 infection would require lifelong treatment for the infant. This can be compared with a risk of respiratory distress syndrome at 38 weeks of 1-2%. Respiratory distress syndrome at this gestational age is readily treatable and unlikely to cause long-term problems but may require at least shortterm admission to an intensive care nursery.",
