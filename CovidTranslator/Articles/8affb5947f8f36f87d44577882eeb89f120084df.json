Prompt diagnosis of GAS can improve the quality of patient care and minimize the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Objective Our objective was to develop an alternative nucleic acid amplification method for the diagnosis of GAS. Method We developed and evaluated a strand invasion based amplification (SIBA) assay to rapidly and specifically detect GAS. The performance of the developed GAS SIBA assay was compared with an established GAS polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Results The GAS SIBA assay detected small amounts (ten copies) of S. pyogenes DNA within 13 min. The rapid detection time was achieved in part by optimization of magnesium concentration and reaction temperature. The sensitivity and specificity of the GAS SIBA assay for detection of S. pyogenes from clinical specimens were both 100%, and clinical specimens were detected within ~ 8 min of starting the reaction. Conclusion Because the GAS SIBA assay is performed at low and constant temperature, it can be used both in centralized laboratories and for point-of-care testing. Furthermore, given its short detection time and strong analytical performance, the GAS SIBA assay could help to improve patient care and minimize unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.",

GAS infection is a major healthcare burden, accounting for 5-15 and 20-30% of sore throat hospital visits in adults and children, respectively [3] . Untreated GAS infection can lead to life-threatening diseases such as acute rheumatic fever and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [4, 5] . Because S. pyogenes has remained fairly susceptible to broad-spectrum antibiotics, patients with GAS infections are often treated with antibacterial agents such as penicillin or amoxicillin [3] . However, the clinical signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis are similar to those of nonstreptococcal pharyngitis, particularly viral pharyngitis [6] . Consequently, clinicians rely on laboratory tests to confirm or exclude GAS, make appropriate treatment decisions, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics.",

Throat culture remains the most prominent method, but has a relatively long turnaround time (TAT) of 1-2 days. RADTs offer significantly shorter TAT and can be performed in low-resource or point-of-care settings. However, in comparison with the throat culture method, RADTs have inadequate sensitivity, between 70 and 90% [7] [8] [9] . According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations, children with negative GAS RADT results should be retested for S. pyogenes by throat culture [5] . Due to their superior sensitivity in comparison with RADTs, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), e.g., real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have recently been introduced for identification of GAS infections [10] . However, the TATs of NAATs are still significantly longer than those of RADTs, and are limited to specialized laboratories because of the requirement for sophisticated instrumentation. NAATs with a rapid TAT could aid in timely diagnosis of S. pyogenes, thereby improving patient care and treatment decisions.",

Our NAAT is based on a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method called strand invasion based amplification (SIBA) [11, 12] . SIBA utilizes a recombinase-coated, single-stranded invasion oligonucleotide (IO) to separate the target duplex. Gp32 and UvsX are key proteins required for performing SIBA reactions. Gp32 abolish the formation of secondary structures within the IO, enabling UvsX to cooperatively bind the IO. The UvsX-IO filament complex catalyzes the strand separation of the homologous target duplex enabling target-specific primers to bind and extend the target via DNA polymerase. These events subsequently lead to an isothermal exponential amplification of the target nucleic acid (Fig. 1) . The method was capable of detecting S. pyogenes within minutes and exhibited high analytical sensitivity and specificity.",

Consequently, timely diagnosis of GAS infection plays an important role in improving patient care and limiting the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Due to their short TAT and ease of use, RADTs have been used to facilitate rapid detection of S. pyogenes. However, due to their inadequate sensitivity, negative results obtained by RADT still require further confirmation by culture [5] . NAATs offer superior sensitivity over RADTs but have longer TATs. Furthermore, due to their requirement for skilled personnel and large instruments, the use of NAATs is often confined to large central laboratories. Rapid NAATs with high analytical performance could facilitate prompt diagnosis of GAS infection, improving patient care and clinical decision-making.",

Moreover, it could detect as few as ten copies of S. pyogenes DNA within 13 min of starting the reaction, significantly faster than previously reported NAATs. This short TAT was achieved in part by optimization of the magnesium concentration and reaction temperature. The GAS SIBA assay was functional at a wide range of magnesium concentrations (5-30 mM) . Magnesium ion is an important cofactor for the recombinase and DNA polymerase used in SIBA, and is also an important cofactor for the DNA polymerase used in PCR. The presence of trace amounts of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or other ions (e.g., calcium) originating from specimens or extraction inhibits PCR reactions [18] , either by chelating or competing with magnesium ions required by the DNA polymerase. In PCR, the optimal concentration of magnesium is usually between 1 and 3 mM, whereas higher concentrations can be inhibitory [19, 20] . Therefore, PCR reactions can easily be inhibited by specimens containing small amounts of chelating agents or competing ions. By contrast, because SIBA is tolerant to high levels of magnesium, residual amounts of chelators or competing ions would have minimal effects on the reaction. Thus, SIBA reactions may be more tolerant to inhibitors than the PCR method. Furthermore, because the GAS SIBA assay is functional over a wide range of temperatures (37-48 \u00b0C), highly accurate temperature-controlled instruments are not necessary for SIBA reactions.",
