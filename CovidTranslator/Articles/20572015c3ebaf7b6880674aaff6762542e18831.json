Bacterial meningitis was first described by Viesseux [1] in 1805. The fatality rate approached 100%. In 1913, Flexner [2] first reported some treatment success with the use of an intrathecal equine meningococcal antiserum. Since then much has changed; the use of antibiotics and the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine have decreased mortality rates as well as shifted the relative frequency of the various bacteria that are responsible for community-acquired bacterial meningitis [3, 4] . In addition, a dramatic increase in the median age of patients with bacterial meningitis has been observed. In less than a decade, the median age of presenting patients has soared from 15-month-old toddlers to 25-year-old adults [5] .",

Patients who are very young, elderly, or immunocompromised may present atypically and can have a paucity of these symptoms; however, studies consistently report that the vast majority will have at least one traditional finding [4, 8] . Other classic associations include Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs. The former is seen when the clinician flexes the patient's neck and this, in turn, causes the patient to flex his or her hips. The latter can be observed with the patient lying supine in hip flexion at 90 degrees. The patient will resist the clinician's attempt to fully extend the knee secondary to pain [9] . Patients can also present with photophobia, sore throat, and a rash [10] . A classic petechial rash is most commonly associated with Neisseria meningitidis but can also occur with Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria. The same is true for an often associated complication of meningococcal meningitis, the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. It manifests as meningococcemia (or pneumococcal meningitis [6] ) with hypotension and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. In general, an adverse outcome and increased mortality have been observed in persons aged more than 60 years and in patients who initially present with seizure activity or severely altered mental status [4, 5] .",

A definitive diagnosis is important not to satisfy one's own curiosity but to keep statistics current and to better allow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to analyze trends and make recommendations. Furthermore, empiric antibiotic regimens can and should be modified when a particular organism has been identified [11, 12] . There is ongoing debate over whether a CT scan should be performed before lumbar puncture [4] . In general, it may be advisable if the patient has focal neurologic signs, papilledema, or is in a state of coma. The yield of a CT scan is low in the absence of such findings [11, 13] .

Bacterial meningitis is a rapidly fatal infection; therefore, empiric intravenous antibiotic treatment is appropriate and necessary. The drawback is the increasing antimicrobial resistance, especially among pneumococci [11] . A better understanding of the pathophysiology and the involvement of inflammatory cytokines in the disease process has led to the use of corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment. Although early reports stated that steroids did not affect overall mortality, it was soon recognized that they decrease the rate of complications associated with bacterial meningitis, especially sensorineural hearing loss [3] . Other sequelae include brain damage, learning disabilities, and mental retardation [5, 14] . In 2007 the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews stated that the use of corticosteroids in community-acquired bacterial meningitis reduced mortality, hearing loss, and other neurologic complications in children and adults [15] . As a result, dexamethasone is the drug of choice to be given before or with the first antibiotic dose [12, 15] . Table 3 shows the current recommendations for antibiotic treatment in suspected bacterial meningitis cases [11, 12] . Antibiotic prophylaxis for close contacts of patients with meningococcal meningitis is currently recommended. Close contacts include members of the same household or day care center, and those with direct contact with oral secretions (may include emergency medical service or emergency department personnel). Current regimens for prophylaxis include single-dose ciprofloxacin, 400 mg orally, or rifampin, 600 mg orally q12 hrs for four doses. Respiratory isolation is recommended for all suspected meningitis patients [14] .",

In one case report, improvement was observed secondary to immunotherapy [26] ; however, the majority of patients in another study actually did worse when compared with patients who were not treated with any steroids or anticonvulsants [19] .

Reports have suggested a mortality rate of 30% to 70% despite aggressive treatment [35] TSS is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococcus. S aureus TSS has a strong association with tampon use, intravaginal contraceptive devices, nasal packing, and postoperative wound infections, whereas group A streptococcus TSS has been linked to minor trauma, surgical procedures, and viral infections, particularly varicella [36] . Of the total cases of S aureus TSS, 93% percent involve women [37] . Group A streptococcus TSS affects all ages and genders equally. The last active surveillance performed in the United States in 1987 by the CDC showed an annual incidence of 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 population in women aged 15 to 44 years; however, the current incidence is likely much lower after the withdrawal of highly absorbent brands of tampons from the market in the late 1980s. Cases of menstrual-related S aureus TSS accounted for over 90% of total TSS cases in 1980 and have significantly decreased to 59% in 1996, with a predicted annual incidence of 1 case per100,000 women [38] . The incidence of group A streptococcus TSS has maintained a consistent level of approximately 3.5 cases per 100,000 people since the 1980s [39] . Menstrual-related cases are more likely to occur in women who use higher absorbency tampons, who keep a single tampon in place for a longer period of time, and who use tampons continuously for more days in their cycle [40] . Nonmenstrual TSS is quickly gaining ground on menstrual-related cases. Women account for 76% of nonmenstrual cases, perhaps because many cases are related to postpartum wound infections and mastitis. Other causes include surgical wounds, sinusitis, burns, respiratory infections, and skin infections. The number of postsurgical-related cases increased nearly twofold from 1986 to 1996, now accounting for 27% of all cases of nonmenstrual-related TSS [37, 41] .",

In contrast to typical antigens, superantigens do not need to be processed by an antigen-presenting cell to produce the T-cell activation cascade, allowing them to activate many T cells at once and in a very short period of time [42] . S aureus produces TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1) and various enterotoxins, whereas group A streptococcus produces an assortment of pyrogenic exotoxins [43] [44] [45] [46] . The M protein of group A streptococcus is an important virulence factor and gives the organism antiphagocytic properties. Serotypes of group A streptococcus are based on their M type.

Despite the fact that studies suggest a decrease in the recurrence rate with antibiotics, episodes are shown to resolve without antibiotics [54] . Clindamycin has been used for the treatment of S aureus TSS since the syndrome was initially defined. Its use is hypothetically supported by its suppression of protein synthesis and, hence, toxin synthesis, and it has been shown to suppress TSST-1 synthesis in vitro by 90% even at levels below inhibitory concentrations [55] . The same study showed that beta-lactam antibiotics actually increased levels of TSST-1, most likely because of their mechanism of action on the cell wall leading to cell lysis or increased membrane permeability resulting in increased release of toxin. A more recent 2006 in vitro study showed that clindamycin and linezolid completely suppressed TSST-1, whereas maximum toxin production occurred with nafcillin and vancomycin [56] . The most appropriate treatment regimen can be selected based on culture and sensitivity results. Patients with suspected S aureus TSS should be treated empirically with clindamycin plus vancomycin or linezolid. If sensitivity results show methicillin-sensitive S aureus, vancomycin can be changed to oxacillin or nafcillin.",

            "text": "Antibiotic regimens for simple group A streptococcus infections are relatively simple because group A streptococcus remains nearly universally sensitive to penicillins. Unfortunately, complicated group A streptococcus infections are shown to have a high mortality rate despite aggressive antibiotic therapy, and penicillin has been shown to have limited effects if not initiated early in the disease. Studies suggest that penicillin loses its effectiveness once large numbers of group A streptococcus are present. This loss is attributed to the fact that penicillins and beta-lactams work best against rapidly growing bacteria. Once concentrations of group A streptococcus build up, replication slows down, reducing the effectiveness of the antibiotic [57] . Clindamycin is now used as an alternative to penicillin for several key reasons. First, clindamycin is not affected by the number of group A streptococcus or the stage of growth. Second, as mentioned previously, clindamycin suppresses protein synthesis, including toxins. Third, it allows phagocytosis of group A streptococcus by inhibiting M-protein synthesis [58] [59] [60] . In addition, clindamycin has a longer postantibiotic effect than penicillin and suppresses the production of tumor necrosis factor. Current guidelines for antibiotic regimens for group A streptococcus TSS are based on limited retrospective trials, which suggest use of a protein synthesis-inhibiting antibiotic (eg, clindamycin) with a cell wall-inhibiting antibiotic (eg, beta-lactams) [61] .",

During the 2003 to 2004 influenza season, the CDC received reports of severe pneumonia caused by S aureus and MRSA among previously healthy children and adults after influenza virus infection [75] . Of the 17 case patients identified, 5 died (median age, 28 years), and only 1 had underlying illness. Most died within 1 week of symptom onset. Most infections were caused by MRSA (76%), 85% had the PVL genes, and all were uniformly resistant to macrolides [75] . Another study of 10 cases of CA-MRSA pneumonia occurred in association with the influenza season in 2006 to 2007 [76] . Sixty percent of the patients who were co-infected died of their illness. Various mechanisms by which influenza interacts with S aureus to increase the risk of co-infection have been suggested. They include an influenza-induced increase in S aureus adhesion to the respiratory tract and an increase in S aureus proteases which leads to a synergistic increase in severity of both the influenza and S aureus infection [78] [79] [80] .",

Most antimicrobial studies are performed on hospital-acquired MRSA infections, making antibiotic decision making difficult for CA-MRSA pneumonia. Linezolid is a bacteriostatic choice with activity against MRSA that is relatively new to the market. Some studies suggest that linezolid and clindamycin are superior to vancomycin due to their ability to inhibit exotoxin production, specifically PVL [81] ; however, an open-label trial of linezolid versus vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia showed equivalent rates of clinical cure (75% versus 75%) [85] . A retrospective analysis of two prospective double-blind clinical trails of hospitalacquired pneumonia suggested that cure rates of linezolid were superior to that of vancomycin (59% versus 36%); however, no differences in outcomes for patients with concomitant bacteremia were appreciated [81, [86] [87] [88] . To date, no study has demonstrated superiority of linezolid over vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia; therefore, the choice remains one of physician preference. Other antibiotics, including trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and daptomycin, have undergone limited trials with poor demonstrable efficacy.",
