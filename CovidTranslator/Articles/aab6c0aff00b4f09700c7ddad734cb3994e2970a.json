            "text": "The innate immune system plays a central role in host defence against viruses. While many studies portray mechanisms in early antiviral immune responses of humans and mice, much remains to be discovered about these mechanisms in the cat. With the objective of shedding light on early host-virus interactions in felids, we have developed 12 real-time TaqMan \u00ae qPCR systems for feline genes relevant to innate responses to viral infection, including those encoding for various IFN\u2423 and IFN subtypes, IFN\u2424, intracellular antiviral factor Mx, NK cell stimulator IL-15 and effectors perforin and granzyme B, as well as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 8. Using these newly developed assays and others previously described, we measured the relative expression of selected markers at early time points after viral infection in vitro and in vivo. Feline embryonic fibroblasts (FEA) inoculated with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) indicated peak levels of IFN\u02db, IFN\u02c7 and Mx expression already 6 h after infection. In contrast, Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CrFK) cells inoculated with feline herpes virus (FHV) responded to infection with high levels of IFN\u02db and IFN\u02c7 only after 24 h, and no induction of Mx could be detected. In feline PBMCs challenged in vitro with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), maximal expression levels of IFN\u02db, \u02c7 and \u03c9 subtype genes as well as IL-15 and TLRs 3, 7 and 8 were measured between 12 and 24 h after infection, whereas expression levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene IL-6 were consistently downregulated until 48 h post inoculation. A marginal upregulation of granzyme B was also observed within 3 h after infection. In an in vivo experiment, cats challenged with FIV exhibited a 2.4-fold increase in IFN\u02db expression in blood 1 week post infection. We furthermore demonstrate the possibility of stimulating feline immune cells in vitro with various immune response modifiers (IRMs) already known for their immunostimulatory properties in mice and humans, namely Poly IC, Resiquimod (R-848) and dSLIM TM , a synthetic oligonucleotide containing several unmethylated CpG motifs. Stimulation of feline PBMCs with dSLIM TM and R-848 effectively enhanced expression of IFN\u02db within 12 h by factors of 6 and 12, respectively, and Poly IC induced an increase in Mx mRNA expression of 28-fold. Altogether, we describe new molecular tools and their successful use for the characterization of innate immune responses against viruses in the cat and provide evidence that feline cells can be stimulated by synthetic molecules to enhance their antiviral defence mechanisms.",

Presumably, the way of life of felids has driven over time the development of viruses with highly efficient viral transmission strategies and the potential to induce chronic or latent infections, thus increasing carrier populations and viral dissemination (Pontier et al., 2009) . It is today widely accepted that the initial antiviral immune response of the mammalian host plays an essential role in determining the outcome of viral infection. Although extensive studies have been carried out in mouse models, the antiviral innate immune system of the cat remains poorly understood, leaving open questions regarding initial responses to viral infection as well as the possibility of manipulating innate immune mechanisms in favour of the host. In order to illustrate the current status of research concerning innate antiviral defence mechanisms in cats, we will first give a short overview of general knowledge in this field.",

With respect to viruses, the host's intrinsic defence structures recognize mostly genomic nucleic acids and replication intermediates. Three main classes of PAMPs have emerged to date: double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and unmethylated CpG DNA. In turn, the detection of these PAMPs relies on a limited set of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Three classes of PRR molecules seem to survey various cell compartments for presence of PAMPs and promote intrinsic antiviral immunity: the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)like receptors (RLRs) and the cytoplasmic viral DNA sensors (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2010) .",

            "text": "TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins either expressed on the cell surface or retained in intracellular compartments. Among the 12 TLRs in mice and 10 TLRs in humans that have been identified to date (Tabeta et al., 2004) , three share the ability to bind nucleic acids, namely those expressed in endosomal compartments of various subsets of dendritic cells (DCs). Thus, upon phagocytic or endocytic events, TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 can sense viral dsRNA, ssRNA or unmethylated CpG-DNA respectively (Vaidya and Cheng, 2003) . TLR8, a structurally homologous variant of TLR7, seems to be non-functional in mice, but has been described in humans as recognising similar molecular patterns to TLR7 (Jurk et al., 2002) . To date, various synthetic ligands have been identified for these TLRs, among which the most popular include Poly IC, a synthetic double-stranded polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid, a well-known synthetic analogue to dsRNA and stimulator of TLR3 (Jiang et al., 2003) ; imidazoquinolines such as resiquimod (R-848), synthetic compounds that bind to TLR7/8 (Wagner et al., 1999) ; and synthetic CpG molecules, which trigger TLR9 (Vollmer et al., 2004) . Such Toll-like receptor agonists have not only been used extensively for research purposes linked to the understanding of innate immune mechanisms, but have also gained much popularity in the clinical field, as treatments for various types of disease and as vaccine adjuvants (Meyer and Stockfleth, 2008; Seya and Matsumoto, 2009) .",

            "text": "PAMP-triggered PRRs activate distinct signaling pathways that converge on the activation of specific transcription factors NFB, AP-1, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7, enhancing the expression of both proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF\u2423, and type I IFNs, the main players in eradication of replicating viruses in antiviral innate immunity (Schindler et al., 2007) . In humans, the large family of type I IFNs primarily include IFN\u2423, IFN\u2424 and IFN (Bekisz et al., 2004) . IFN\u2423 consists of a group of 13 structurally related proteins, each encoded by a separate intronless gene, while only one protein each for IFN\u2424 and IFN have been characterized. Type I IFNs are produced by almost all cell types, with IFN\u2424 being the main IFN secreted by fibroblasts in response to viral challenge. Essentially, the ubiquitous presence of IFN receptor complex composed of two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (Uze et al., 2007) and the pleiotropy of these cytokines enable IFNs to initiate potent antiviral responses. First, type I IFNs activate, in uninfected target cells, the production of intracellular effectors that can interfere with several steps of virus replication cycles. Well-studied examples of these antiviral proteins include myxovirus-resistance protein (Mx) GTPase, the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), the 2 ,5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and the interferon stimulated gene (ISG) 15 (mechanisms reviewed in Sadler and Williams, 2008) . The Mx protein, for instance, binds to essential viral components thus blocking their intracellular transport . Moreover, production of this protein is widely recognized as a marker for upregulation of type I IFNs . Through positive feedback processes, type I IFNs were additionally shown to enhance the expression of TLRs, further sensitizing cells to microbial recognition (Siren et al., 2005) . Finally, type I IFNs effectively bridge innate and adaptive immunity by promoting the differentiation and function of various immune cell populations such as DCs, NK cells, B cells, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations (Colonna et al., 2004) .",

Primary NK targets are host cells lacking MHC I molecules on their surface. As most viruses have evolved mechanisms to downregulate host cell MHC expression in order to avoid immune responses resulting from antigen presentation, virally infected cells are readily attacked by NK cells. In addition to type I IFNs, IL-15 was shown to support development and survival of NK cells as well as to stimulate their cytokine production.

Nakamura et al. cloned the first cDNA sequence for feline IFN in 1992 (Nakamura et al., 1992) . The purified protein was classified as omega-type (Ueda et al., 1993b) and rapidly shown to exhibit antiviral activity both in vitro and in vivo (Tables 1 and 2) . As a result, Nakamura's IFN became the first feline antiviral drug available on the market, currently sold both in Japan (Intercat \u00ae , Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan) and Europe (Virbagen \u00ae omega, Laboratoire Virbac, Carros Cedex, France) to treat feline calicivirus and canine parvovirus infections. Subsequently, therapeutic effects of this product as stand-alone or combinatorial agent were described in the context of a series of feline and canine diseases (Table 2 ). In recent years, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of many feline type I IFN subtypes have been characterized. In all, 13 subtypes each of the feIFN\u02db and feIFN\u03c9 genes have been cloned and the biological antiviral properties of the purified proteins were demonstrated in vitro (Table 1) . Studies concerning the structure of these IFN\u2423 and IFN subtypes have indicated that both protein families have high homology and that feline IFN is more similar to the IFN\u2423 than to the IFN of other animal species. Although the individual functions of all these IFN subtypes in the cat is unknown, the impressive number of type I IFN genes identified to date underlines the necessity of broad antiviral responses in felids (Table 1) .",

The physiological effects of oral or ocular treatment with this recombinant IFN were later assessed by local and systemic measurement of the feline Mx protein (Bracklein et al., 2006) , which had already been previously described (Horisberger et al., 1990) . More recently, stimulation of feline cells with recombinant IFN was shown to induce expression of feline ISG15. Molecular cloning of this gene enabled detection of the immunomodulatory properties of both cell-conjugated and free forms of this antiviral effector protein (Tanabe et al., 2008) . Altogether, these studies illustrate the breadth of IFN-induced antiviral mechanisms in the cat. The recent cloning and molecular characterization of the feline IFNAR2 (Xue et al., 2010) may support the study of further effector functions of type I IFNs in the cat.",

Primers for each system were first tested for the generation of amplicons of expected length in PCR assays comprising cDNA synthesized from ConA-stimulated PBMCs. The PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized using the Chemigenius 2 BioImaging System (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Only primers indicating appropriate specificity and amplification products of correct length were utilized for further optimization. Primer and probe concentrations for each system were optimized on five-fold serial dilutions of cDNA derived from ConA-stimulated PBMCs. cDNA was diluted in 30 g/ml salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) and quadruplicates of each dilution were tested simultaneously. Matched forward and reverse primer concentrations of 300, 600 and 900 nM were evaluated first with a probe end concentration of 250 nM. The performance of the assays was further optimized using the best primer concentrations combined with 3 different probe end concentrations, namely 50, 150, and 250 nM.

Type I IFN genes were upregulated as of 6 h post inoculation. Peak levels of 374-fold and 121-fold inductions in gene expression of IFN\u02db and IFN\u03c9 were achieved at 12 h post infection, while strongest induction of IFN\u02c7, namely by a factor of 114, was measured 24 h after FIV inoculation. Although maximal gene expression levels were slightly lower for the individual IFN\u02db subtypes tested (65fold, 67-fold and 24-fold for IFNs 3, 7 and 14 respectively), a similar pattern of stimulation was observed, with highest expression 12 h after infection. Mx and IL-15 genes were induced in a manner proportional to the type I IFN genes at all time points measured, with highest increases at 12 h post inoculation of 38-fold and 7-fold, respectively. During the first 48 h, FIV infection downregulated IL-6 expression attaining lowest levels within 6 h after inoculation, when a 60-fold decrease in expression was observed. Genes encoding for contents of NK cell cytotoxic granules appeared only marginally affected when their expression was measured in PBMCs. Both perforin and granzyme B mRNA levels were maximally increased 3 h post infection by 1.8-fold and 2fold, respectively. Similarly, the expression of TLR genes in PBMCs was only slightly influenced by FIV infection. Transcription of TLRs 3, 7 and 8 was however induced in a delayed manner when compared to the cytokines, attaining maximal levels 24 h after infection with induction factors ranging from 2 to 2.6. ",

Over the course of time, mammalian hosts have developed the capacity to counterbalance virus attacks through sensing of viral signatures by specialized immune cells and immediate activation of the type I IFN system. Within minutes to hours, this family of antiviral cytokines initiates an explosion of potent defence mechanisms, leading to the suppression of viral replication and protection of the host. These intrinsic immune responses remain poorly understood in felids, a species that seems particularly sensitive to viral infections, with sporadic viral outbreaks compromising endangered populations (Evermann et al., 1988; Roelke-Parker et al., 1996; Cunningham et al., 2008; Meli et al., 2010) . Until now, the appropriate tools for characterizing innate immune mechanisms in this species were unavailable. In order to better understand the early host-pathogen interactions occurring in feline viral infections, we describe herein the development of 12 real-time qPCR systems to measure the expression of feline genes related to innate antiviral defence mechanisms. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the possibility of monitoring key events in innate immune responses both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate the initiation of antiviral responses in feline immune cells upon stimulation with various IRMs.",

In these experiments, expression levels of IFN\u02db and IL-6 were systematically analyzed as indicators for the initiation of innate immune mechanisms. As Mx expression is strictly regulated by type I IFN (Holzinger et al., 2007) , biological functionality of the induced immune responses was assessed by simultaneous analysis of this factor. In all models of infection used in this study, we observed the characteristic transient expression of type I IFN genes, with a duration ranging from 6 to 12 h in CrFK cells and FEAs inoculated with FHV and FeLV respectively to 36 h in PBMCs infected with FIV. The presence of specialized cells for the production of type I IFNs in the blood is most likely linked to the longer expression of these innate cytokines in PBMCs (Colonna et al., 2004) . Moreover, IFNs \u02db, \u02c7 and \u03c9 were expressed at differential levels in feline cells upon infection; while PBMCs heavily upregulated expression of IFN\u02db and IFN\u03c9 genes, cell lines retaining epithelial and fibroblast properties preferentially increased production of IFN\u02c7 mRNA levels. Time points at which highest expression of antiviral genes was measured also greatly varied with cell type and virus. Although FEA cells responded to presence of FeLV within 6 h, induction of innate immune gene expression could only be observed after 24 h following FHV infection in CrFK cells. Peak antiviral response in PBMCs was measured 12 h after infection, with evidence for progressive development and rapid decrease of the response. Further experiments are necessary to determine the significance of individual properties of cells and tissues as well as virus-related factors such as source and infectious dose in these observations. Interestingly, although high levels of type I IFN expression were observed 24 h after FHV infection of CrFK cells, no induction of Mx was measured, indicating that this virus may have evolved mechanisms to interrupt IFNinduced host defence mechanisms in infected cells. Indeed, many viruses have evolutionarily acquired sophisticated strategies to counteract the IFN system (Katze et al., 2002) . Various members of the herpesvirus family have been reported to directly inhibit the proteins that mediate the antiviral state (Elia et al., 1996) , interfere with the expression of signaling molecules downstream of the IFNAR (Miller et al., 1998) , or hypothetically support the disassembly of nuclear structures to get rid of antiviral components (Van Sant et al., 2001) . These mechanisms have been linked to persistence of infections induced by some viruses of this family. Although there is no evidence for a specific viral inhibitor of Mx proteins so far, viruses can subvert the Mx system through exceptionally fast growth in host cells or by affecting signal transduction upstream of IFN-regulated gene transcription. The presence of other antiviral factors in FHV-infected feline cells could shed light on possible mechanisms linked to these findings.",

Consequently, we studied the effect of viral inoculation in PBMCs on the expression of all cytokines and receptors for which we had developed real-time qPCR systems. High levels of type I IFN expression were measured in response to infection, again most probably linked to the activation of professional dendritic cells producing extraordinary amounts of these cytokines (Colonna et al., 2004) . Similar expression patterns were noted for all IFN\u02db gene subtypes analyzed. Lower induction rates of IFN\u02db3, 7 and 14 subtypes are most likely due to the measurement of individual genes versus the simultaneous quantification of many subtypes with the real-time assay developed for the remaining IFN\u02db subtypes. Although the induction of type I IFN genes largely overlap, the array of IFN\u2423 and IFN subtypes produced upon stimulation seems to be determined by cell-specific levels of transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 (Sato et al., 2000) . Furthermore, the extent of biological activity conferred by each individual protein depends on a variety of factors. Thus, the differential affinity of each subtype to the subunits of the IFNAR, the surface expression level of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 in target cells, as well as the lifetime and stability of the ligand-receptor complex all play a role in the extent of the host response to infection (Genin et al., 2009) . Different pathogens may influence, in this way, the phenotype of the developing immune response by shaping the profile of IFN subtypes induced (Foster et al., 2004) . As previously shown for the human IFN system (Loseke et al., 2003) , the expression analysis of individual subtypes by real-time qPCR can provide valuable information on host innate immune responses to pathogens. We have initiated the development of appropriate tools to study these mechanisms in more detail in feline species.",

Toxicity of this product has long been acknowledged and studied both in vitro and in vivo (Homan et al., 1972; Lv and Bao, 2009) . Mechanisms by which cell death is induced remain unclear, however it has been suggested that pathways leading to the induction of type I IFN genes are uncoupled from apoptotic pathways (Han et al., 2004) . We measured high induction of Mx in Poly IC-treated PBMCs after just 6 h post inoculation. While the possibility that Mx proteins fulfil a cellular function involved in cellular trafficking and/or in stress responses has been postulated (Horisberger, 1992) it remains more likely that presence of this antiviral factor is indicative of IFN\u2423 function.",

Admittedly, innate immune responses may vary considerably between individuals of an outbred species; however, when purified PBMCs from 8 adult SPF cats were previously utilized in similar smaller experiments, only slight variation was observed in their response to IRM stimulation and FIV infection (data not shown). Studies with cells from cats in the field would most likely give relevant information about individuality in responses after IRM stimulation or infection.",
