With limited medical resources, the treatment priority is determined by the severity of patients. However, many mild outpatients quickly deteriorate into severe/critical stage. It is crucial to early identify them and give timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality. This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with potential malignant progression.",

All mild patients were categorized into groups with or without malignant progression. The clinical and laboratory data at admission, the first CT, and the follow-up CT at the severe/critical stage of the two groups were compared. Both multivariate logistic regression and deep learning-based methods were used to build the prediction models, with their area under ROC curves (AUC) compared.",

Pathological studies about COVID-19 reported extensive cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial lymphocytes inflammatory infiltrates 20, 21 . Thus, the decrease of albumin and lymphocytes, the following two risk factors, probably suggest they migrate from the circulation into affected alveoli and also resulting in an increase of consolidation on follow-up CT imaging. Elevated HCRP is an indicator of anti-virus inflammation, also served as a risk factor for malignant progression. The risk factors mentioned above are all in accordance with the results from observation studies [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Fibrosis on CT imaging is reported to be closely associated with the late outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia 27,28 . However, our study depicted the early presence of fibrosis on CT imaging is a protective factor for malignant progression, which might reflect early absorption of inflammation and the occurrence of the repair stage.",

Experimental results show that both of them have a significant reference value for this problem and can obtain more accurate prediction results. Furthermore, there is very little literature to date modeling the spatial information of the quantitative CT data and considering the time-series information of patients. This information has important reference value for the prediction of patients with potential malignant progression. Specifically, the quantified spatial CT data is converted into a two-dimensional matrix format according to the real distribution of lung areas. And then, the spatial CT data was combined with the disease course and other infection sign type features. Finally, the hybrid CT data was folded into sequences following the sequence of clinical and patient-specific information.",
