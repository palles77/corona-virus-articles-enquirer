In this study we demonstrate that the Q9392S940 peptide bond, located between the polymerase and Zn-finger regions of pp1ab (the POL2Zn site), is processed by the 3CLpro, albeit inefficiently. Mutagenesis of the POL2Zn site, as well as the previously identified HD123C site in the 1a region of pp1a and pp1ab, demonstrated that the amino acid residues at the P2 and P1 positions of the cleavage site, occupied by L and Q, respectively, were important determinants of 3CLpro substrate specificity. Finally, a direct comparison of the 3CLpro-mediated cleavages at the HD123C and POL2Zn sites was made by determining the rate constants using synthetic peptides. The results show that while a larger polypeptide substrate carrying the HD123C site was processed more efficiently than a polypeptide substrate carrying the POL2Zn site, cleavage of the synthetic peptide substrates containing these two cleavage sites occurred at similar efficiencies. This indicates that the overall conformation of a large polyprotein substrate is important in the accessibility of the cleavage site to the proteinase.",

            "text": "The family Coronaviridae is composed of a group of viruses that cause a variety of diseases in different animal hosts. The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), causes a range of diseases in mouse, including enteritis, hepatitis, encephalitis, and a demyelinating disease (Holmes and Lai, 1996; Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Lai, 1990) . Coronaviruses, along with the arteriviruses, are classified under the newly established order Nidovirales based on the similarities in their genome organization and replication strategy (Cavanagh, 1997; de Vries et al., 1997) . The name Nidovirales originates from the Latin word nidus, meaning \"nest,\" and refers to the 3\u0408 nested set of subgenomic mRNAs that is produced during viral infection (de Vries et al., 1997) . As with all positive-strand RNA viruses, entry of the viral genome into the cytoplasm is followed by the translation of the positive-strand RNA genome, resulting in the expression of viral proteins. The coronavirus genome is organized into seven genes that are separated by stop codons and intergenic sequences (Holmes and Lai, 1996; Lai, 1990) . Thus, translation of the viral genome results only in the expression of gene 1 proteins. The rest of the viral genome is expressed through subgenomic mRNAs that are transcribed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded in gene 1. Replication of the viral genome also requires the replicase proteins encoded in gene 1. Thus, for both viral replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription to take place, the expression of gene 1 products is essential.",

            "text": "The replicase gene (gene 1) ( Fig. 1) of coronaviruses, spanning 20-22 kb, is organized into two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b (Bonilla et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1991) . The expression of the downstream ORF1b is mediated by a ribosomal frameshift event that is aided by the formation of a pseudoknot structure within the overlapping region (Bredenbeek et al., 1990; Brierley et al., 1987; . Thus, two polypeptides, pp1a and pp1ab, are expressed from gene 1, with the translation of pp1ab being only 25-40% as efficient as that of pp1a in in vitro studies (Bredenbeek et al., 1990; Brierley et al., 1987) . Through a series of intricate cotranslational and posttranslational processing events, these polyproteins are converted into a functional complex that in turn is responsible for both genomic RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription (de Vries et al., 1997) . Responsible for these processing events are at least two or three viral proteinases encoded within the ORF1a region of gene 1 (Fig. 1) . Two of these proteinase domains, by sequence analysis, share similarities with the cellular proteinase papain. A third proteinase, resembling the poliovirus 3C proteinase, has also been identified (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991) . The coronavirus 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), flanked on either side by hydrophobic, possibly membrane-spanning regions (HD1 and HD2), is believed to be the prinicipal viral proteinase responsible for the processing events leading to the formation of the viral replicase complex, with as many as 11 potential cleavage sites identified throughout pp1ab (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991 ) (see Fig. 1 ). The presence of the 3CLpro is conserved in all coronavirus genomes studied to date (Bonilla et al., 1994; Boursnell et al., 1987; Eleouet et al., 1995; Lee et al., 1991) . The 3CLpro of MHV-A59 has been identified as a 29-kDa protein (p29) both in in vitro study and in MHV-A59infected cells (Pi\u00f1\u00f3 n et al., 1997) . reported a molecular weight of 27 kDa for the same polypeptide.) The catalytic residues of the MHV-A59 3CLpro, His3374, and Cys3478 have also been identified . Treatment of infected cells with E-64d, a known inhibitor of the 3CLpro, results in the inhibition of viral RNA replication in these cells (Kim et al., 1995) , demonstrating the importance of the action of the 3CLpro in the events leading to viral replication. Van Dinten et al. (1999) demonstrated the importance of 3CLpro cleavages using an infectious clone of the related arterivirus EAV; introduction of mutations into the candidate ORF 1b 3CLpro cleavage sites had drastic effects on RNA synthesis and virus replication. These fndings indicate that this proteinase is a good potential target for antiviral therapy.",

For all three strains, many of the cleavage sites in pp1a have been identified, including a noncanonical LQ2N site that had not previously been predicted Liu and Brown, 1995; Liu et al., 1997; Ng and Liu, 1998; Pi\u00f1\u00f3 n et al., 1997; Tibbles et al., 1996; Ziebuhr et al., 1995; Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999) . In addition, several of the processing sites in ORF1b have also been identified in both IBV and HCV-229E (Gr\u00f6tzinger et al., 1996; Heusipp et al., 1997a,b; Liu et al., 1994 Liu et al., , 1998 . However, for MHV, there has been greater difficulty in demonstrating processing by the 3CLpro at any of the predicted ORF1b cleavage sites. In this study we demonstrate processing by the 3CLpro at the putative ORF1b The following domains are shown: papain-like proteinase (PLP-1 and PLP-2), X domain (X), poliovirus 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), hydrophobic domains (HD1 and HD2), growth factor-like domain (GFL), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POL), zinc-finger domain (Zn), and helicase (HEL). The predicted 3CLpro cleavage sites are indicated by the numbers and the cleavage site sequences from the P5 to the P5\u0408 position are listed in table form (arrow indicates site of cleavage) (Bonilla et al., 1994; Bredenbeek et al., 1990; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991). cleavage site situated between the putative polymerase (POL) and zinc finger (Zn) domains (the POL2Zn site) (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, identification of this site allowed us to make comparisons between the efficiencies of processing at this ORF1b site and a previously identified site in ORF1a located at the junction between hydrophobic domain 1 (HD1) and the 3CLpro (the HD123C site).",

            "text": "We have previously demonstrated processing at an ORF1a site in MHV-A59, located at the junction between HD1 and the 3CLpro (HD123C), by a recombinant MHV-A59 3CLpro expressed as a fusion protein with the maltose binding protein (MBP) (Pi\u00f1\u00f3 n et al., 1997) . The plasmid pET21-NX.3C C3478A, encoding the carboxy-terminal 98 amino acids of HD1 and the inactivated 3CLpro, is in vitro transcribed and translated to yield a 40-kDa substrate NX.3C (Fig. 3A, lane 1) . As previously demonstrated (Pi\u00f1\u00f3 n et al., 1997), upon addition of the recombinant MBP-3CLpro, this substrate is efficiently processed into the 29-kDa proteinase (3C) and the 11-kDa HD1-derived product (NX) (lane 2). Other studies using similar methods have led to the identification of ORF1a cleavage sites downstream of the 3CLpro, including a previously unidentified, noncanonical LQ2N site . However, the demonstration of processing at ORF1b sites has proven to be difficult. Our work with papain-like proteinase 1 (PLP-1) showed that substrate length, and possibly substrate conformation, played an important role in the ability of a substrate to be cleaved efficiently by the proteinase (Teng et al., 1999) . We therefore created several substrates of various lengths, encoding different putative cleavage sites in ORF1b, in order to investigate processing by the recombinant MBP-3CLpro. Of these, only the substrate expressed from pET21-POL.Zn, encoding MHV-A59 ORF1b amino acids L714-Q1201, proved to be useful in our investigations. In vitro transcription-translation of the construct pET21-POL.Zn resulted in the expression of a 55-kDa full-length substrate, POL.Zn (predicted molecular weight 56 kDa) (Fig. 3B , lane 1). Upon incubation of this substrate with the recombinant MBP-3CLpro enzyme, cleavage between Q939 and S940, would give rise to two products, an N-terminal product with a predicted molecular weight (Bonilla et al., 1994; Bredenbeek et al., 1990; Lee et al., 1991) . The positions of the catalytic residues, His3374 and Cys3478, are shown. pET 21-HA-HD1.3C encodes MHV-A59 amino acids from S3149 to G3636 directly downstream of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag under the control of the T7 promoter (\u00c1). pET21-NX.3C encodes MHV-A59 amino acids from K3258 to Q3636. pMal-3C.wt encodes MHV-A59 amino acid sequences from S3334 to G3636 fused to the mal E gene encoding the maltose-binding protein (MBP). The construct pMAL-3C is used for the overexpression of the 3CLpro in Escherichia coli. (C) Enlarged map of POL and Zn region of ORF1b and schematic representation of plasmids derived from this region. The position of the Q9392S940 cleavage site at the junction between POL and Zn is shown. pET21-POL.Zn encodes MHV-A59 ORF1b amino acids from L714 to Q1201 under the control of the T7 promoter. of 26 kDa (POL) and a C-terminal product with a predicted molecular weight of 30 kDa (Zn). In Fig. 3B , lane 2, the addition of the recombinant MBP-3CLpro to the POL.Zn substrate resulted in the production of a 26-kDa protein which presumably corresponds to the N-terminal processing product. Mutagenesis of Q939 to K (lane 4) or R (lane 6) abolished this processing, suggesting that the cleavage is occurring at the predicted site and that, in view of the substrate specificity demonstrated, the observed processing event is in fact due to the action of the recombinant MBP-3CLpro.",

We observed that the L3332 and Q3333 residues, at the P2 and P1 positions, respectively, were most sensitive to mutations. Any mutation at either one of these positions inhibited the autocatalytic cis processing by the 3CLpro (Fig. 4 , lanes 6-10). In contrast, mutations at any of the other positions studied were tolerated and the expression of precursor proteins harboring mutations at these sites still resulted in the autocatalytic release of the 29-kDa 3CLpro. Exceptions are the S3334C substitution at position P1\u0408 (lane 12) and the G3335P substitution at position P2\u0408 (lane 14). These mutations also abolish the cis processing by the 3CLpro. The effect of the G3335P mutation, however, is expected since the introduction of a P at this site could result in a drastic change in the conformation at the cleavage site.",

The release of the 29-kDa 3CLpro from this precursor can only be accomplished by incubation with the recombinant MBP-3CLpro. Figure 5 showed that the effect of these mutations on trans cleavage paralleled the effects on cis cleavage. Those mutations centering around the P2 and P1 positions of the cleavage site (L3332 and Q3333, respectively) affected trans processing the most. For the POL2Zn cleavage site in ORF1b, similar mutagenesis studies were conducted in order to determine the cleavage specificity requirements at this site (Fig. 6) . Mutations from the P3 to the P1\u0408 position were introduced into the plasmid pET21-POL.Zn. The mutant substrates were expressed using an in vitro transcriptiontranslation system and then incubated with the recombinant MBP-3CLpro. The effect of the mutations on the production of p26 was assayed by SDS-PAGE and com-pared to the processing of the wildtype POL.Zn substrate (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2) . The results were similar to that observed with the ORF1a HD123C site in that the L938 and Q939 residues, at the P2 and P1 positions respectively, were most sensitive to mutations. The L938I mutation (Fig. 6 , lanes 5 and 6) resulted in the inhibition of p26 processing, indicating the sensitivity of this site to a conservative change. However, the L938M substitution (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8) did not abolish processing of p26. Mutation of Q939 to either K (lanes 9 and 10) or R (lanes 11 and 12) abolished processing at this site. Substitution of S940 with an A (lanes 13 and 14) was tolerated, whereas mutating S940 to the bulkier N (lanes 15 and 16) resulted in the inhibition of p26 processing.",

The substrates, NX.3C and POL.Zn, were incubated with a fixed amount of recombinant proteinase for increasing periods of time. We observed that the ORF1a substrate, NX.3C, is readily processed within 1 h, with the substrate completely converted into product by 20 h (Fig. 7A) . Processing of the ORF1b substrate, however, is not observed until after 4 h of incubation with the recombinant proteinase. Furthermore, cleavage of POL.Zn occurs at a much lower level and does not reach completion even after 30 h (Fig. 7B ). This inefficiency of processing of the POL2Zn site compared to the HD123C site may be explained in two ways. First, although the primary sequences of the two sites reveal no obvious reason why one is processed more efficiently than the other, it is possible that the subtle differences in the sequences of the two sites are enough to make the HD123C site a more efficient substrate than the POL2Zn site. Alternatively, the difference may not be inherent to the primary sequence of the cleavage sites, but rather to the conformation of the entire substrate as a whole. It is possible that the substrate conformation of NX.3C allows the recombinant proteinase better access to the cleavage site. In the POL.Zn substrate, the cleavage site may be more obscured, and in this manner the virus regulates both when and how much of its encoded proteins are produced.",

Molecular weight markers are indicated on the left. has been linked to the processing of several nonstructural proteins encoded in the 5\u0408 end of the viral genome (Baker et al., 1989; Bonilla et al., 1995; Denison et al., 1992; Hughes et al., 1995) . These cleavage products, p28 and p65, are not yet linked with any known viral function. However, those viral proteins with presumed functions in viral replication and viral RNA transcription, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POL) and the zinc-finger/helicase (Zn-HEL) proteins, are believed to be processed by the 3C-like proteinase of the virus. The 3CLpro is predicted to cleave at, at least, 11 sites in pp1ab. Many of the cleavage sites located in the 1a region of pp1ab have been shown to be functional cleavage sites and processing by the 3CLpro at these sites has been demonstrated in the coronaviruses IBV (Liu et al., 1997; Liu and Brown, 1995; Ng and Liu, 1998; Tibbles et al., 1996) , HCV-229E (Ziebuhr et al., 1995; Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999) , and MHV-A59 Pi\u00f1\u00f3 n et al., 1997) . Some of the mature viral products resulting from these cleavages have also been identified in infected cells (Liu et al., 1997; Lu et al., 1998; Ng and Liu, 1998; Pi\u00f1\u00f3 n et al., 1997; Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999; Denison et al., 1999) . According to computer predictions, further processing at the Q9392S940, Q15392C1540, Q20602S2061, and Q24342A2435 sites located in the 1b region of MHV-A59 pp1ab would result in mature viral products of 106, 67, 59, 42, and 33 kDa, respectively, corresponding to POL, Zn-HEL, and the three C-terminal-most cleavage products. In HCV-229E, viral products of 105, 71, and 41 kDa, corresponding to the POL, Zn-HEL, and the second C-terminal-most proteins, have been identified in infected cells and the role of the 3CLpro in the processing of these products has been authenticated in vitro (Gr\u00f6tzinger et al., 1996; Heusipp et al., 1997a,b) . Similarly, in the case of IBV, viral proteins of 100, 39, and 35 kDa have been identified in infected cells (corresponding to POL and the two C-terminal-most proteins) and cotransfection experiments have implicated the 3CLpro in the processing of these viral products (Liu et al., 1994 . For MHV-A59, however, demonstration of processing at any MHV cleavage site in the 1b region of pp1ab has lagged behind that of HCV and IBV. Here we report the first demonstration of processing at the site between POL and Zn in pp1ab by the MHV-A59 3CLpro.",

            "text": "The cleavage at the POL2Zn site is highly inefficient compared to the processing observed at the HD123C site, as evidenced by the time course assays illustrated in Fig. 7 . Phosphorimager analyses indicate that the POL.Zn substrate is cleaved fivefold less efficiently than the NX.3C substrate (data not shown). The differences in these efficiencies, however, could not be explained by the subtle differences in the primary sequences of the cleavage sites alone. In fact, when presented to the enzyme in the context of a 14-or 15-mer peptide substrate, there was no substantial difference in cleavage efficiency between these two peptides, an observation that would seem to contradict the results obtained with the larger polyprotein substrates. Recently, Ziebuhr and Siddell (1999) investigated the efficiency of processing at several HCV-229E 3CLpro sites located at the C-terminus of pp1a or the central region of pp1ab. They observed that several viral products were produced less efficiently than others, with reduced cleavage activity at two ORF 1a sites, between V-Q35462S3547 and L-Q38242N3825, compared with cleavage at the sites flanking the 3Clpro domain. The corresponding LQ2N site in MHV-A59 has also been shown to be less effi-ciently cleaved than the LQ2S sites flanking the 3CLpro domain . In the case of L-Q38242N3825 in HCV-229E, additional peptide cleavage data demonstrated that the properties of the cleavage sequence itself, rather than the overall conformation of the polypeptide and the accessibility of the cleavage site, contribute to the observed inefficiency of processing at this site (Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999) . While our results do not contradict theirs, they do demonstrate that, in vivo, the conformation of a larger polypeptide substrate is likely to be as important a determinant of cleavage as is the primary structure and sequence of the cleavage site. Our results clearly show that, at least with the case of the POL2Zn site of MHV-A59, the observed inefficiency of cleavage was likely due to the overall conformation of the polypeptide, which may directly translate into the accessibility of the cleavage site, rather than the primary sequence of the site. Taken together, both sets of results highlight important regulatory mechanisms employed by the virus to coordinate the temporal production and the accumulation of the various replicase proteins.",

            "text": "The substrate specificity of the coronavirus 3CLpro has been determined mainly through the identification of functional cleavage sites and a visual inspection of these cleavage site sequences. Mutagenesis has been done primarily to verify the authenticity of the cleavage site and most mutagenesis studies have not extended beyond the Q residue that is absolutely conserved at the P1 position in all 3CLpro cleavage sites identified to date. We have extended our mutagenesis studies to cover the P3 to P3\u0408 positions of the cleavage site sequence. Our results demonstrated that the substrate sequence specificity of the 3CLpro is primarily influenced by the amino acid residues present at the P2 and P1 positions of the cleavage site. Substitution of the Q residue at the P1 position with any other amino acid has resulted in substrates that could not be cleaved by the 3CLpro, demonstrating the importance of this residue in the substrate. We could not detect any processing in substrates containing mutations at this position (Figs. 4-6) . The P2 position of the cleavage site is most often occupied by an L; however, in some cleavage sites identified in HCV-229E, this position is occupied by a V or an I (Gr\u00f6tzinger FIG. 8 . Chromatograms of cleavage products of the synthetic peptides corresponding to ORF1a amino acids and ORF1b amino acids. A and B show chromatograms of ORF1a peptide (1 mM) and ORF1b peptide (1 mM), respectively, at 0 h and after 16 h of incubation with MBP-3CLpro (17.5 M enzyme) at 30\u00b0C. In both panels the chromatograms for t \u03ed 0 h are offset to allow comparison between the two time points. The asterisks (*) indicate the cleavage products that were used in peptide sequencing in order to confirm the sites of cleavage. Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999) , suggesting that this position is not as strictly conserved as the P1 position and may thus be able to tolerate some mutations. However, our results demonstrated otherwise, in that even a conservative change to I resulted in a reduction of cleavage , to below 20%, as measured by phosphorimager analysis (data not shown). This suggests that perhaps an I at the P2 position of the cleavage site can be functional only when compensated for elsewhere in the substrate sequence. The only change tolerated at this position was a change to M in the P2 position at the POL2Zn site (Fig. 6) . Interestingly, the JHM strain of MHV encodes an M instead of an L at this position (Lee et al., 1991) . Thus such a mutation resulted in a wildtype JHM POL2Zn site and a cleavage efficiency equivalent to wildtype levels. This provides indirect evidence that the POL2Zn site in JHM is a functional 3CLpro site. Although the S found at the P1\u0408 position of both the HD123C and POL2Zn sites is not as sensitive to mutations, we observed that some mutations, such as S3334C (in the HD123C site) (Fig. 4) and S940N (in the POL2Zn site) (Fig. 6) , are not tolerated. Additionally, both S3334A and S940A substitutions, though tolerated, resulted in a reduction, but not complete inhibition of cleavage , suggesting that the residue at the P1\u0408 position also plays a role in substrate recognition, although to a lesser extent than those at the P1 and P2 positions.",

(1996) . Briefly, E. coli TB1 cells transformed with pMAL-3C.wt were grown at 37\u00b0C in the presence of ampicillin (100 g/ml) until the A 600nm reached 0.8, at which point the cells were induced with isopropylthio-\u2424-D-galactoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mM for 4 h at 25\u00b0. Cells were harvested and then resuspended in 10 ml of column buffer [20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5)], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT] per gram of cells. The cell suspension was then lysed by sonication. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 9000g for 30 min. The crude lysates were diluted 1:5 in column buffer and then loaded onto an amylose column (bed volume 6 ml), preequilibrated with column buffer, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was then washed with 12 column volumes of column buffer and the MBP-3CLpro fusion protein was eluted with column buffer containing 10 mM maltose. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and those containing the 72-kDa recombinant MBP-3CLpro were identified by analyzing 10-l aliquots by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the recombinant proteinase were pooled and the concentration of the fusion proteinase was determined using the Bradford assay against known concentrations of bovine serum albumin. The recombinant proteinase was stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C in column buffer supplemented with 20% glycerol.",
