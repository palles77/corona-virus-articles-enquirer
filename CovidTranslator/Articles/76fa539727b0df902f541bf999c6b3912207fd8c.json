Specimens were obtained from archived samples received for routine diagnosis during 2014-2016. Sequencing showed that virus from Ireland clustered with virus sequences obtained in Europe within the D/swine/ OK/1334/2011 clade. I nfluenza D virus is a recently characterized addition to the family Orthomyxoviridae. This virus was originally detected in pigs in the United States (1); however, cattle are now believed to be the main reservoir species (2) . Evidence suggests that this virus plays a role in bovine respiratory disease, although experimentally, it caused only mild disease by itself (3). Influenza D virus has been found to be associated with respiratory disease in feedlot cattle (4) .",

            "text": "Two cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis occurred in Madagascar, 1 in 2015 and 1 in 2016. We report the characterization of the novel sequence type, 834, which carried the mrp+/sly+/epf+ virulence marker and a mutation G\u2192T at position 174, leading to a substitution mutS1 to mutS284.S treptococcus suis is a common pathogen among pigs that can be transmitted to humans, in whom it causes invasive infection. In recent years, cases among humans have been reported worldwide, and a large outbreak occurred in China in 2005 (1). In some areas, S. suis appeared as the most common etiology of adult meningitis (2) . Data from Africa were scarce until the recent report of 15 cases in Togo (3). We report 2 cases of S. suis meningitis in Antananarivo, Madagascar.In March 2015, a 24-year-old man (patient 1) was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Befelatanana Hospital (Antananarivo) seeking treatment for fever, headache, and unilateral sixth nerve palsy. One year later, in March 2016, a 60-year-old woman (patient 2) was admitted to the same unit with meningitis and sudden hearing loss. Patient 1 worked in a slaughterhouse and patient 2 as a cook; both were frequently exposed to pork meat. Both patients were febrile (temperature >39.9\u00b0C) and confused and had a score of <13 out of 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Laboratory results for lumbar puncture showed turbid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with increased cell numbers (446 cells/ \u00b5L, 56% neutrophils for patient 1; 1,180 cells/\u00b5L, 86% neutrophils for patient 2 [reference range <10/\u00b5L]); high protein levels (1.4 g/L for patient 1, 2.34 g/L for patient 2 [reference range 0.15-0.45 g/L]); and low glucose levels (0.28 mmol/L for patient 1; 0.73 mmol/L for patient 2 [reference range 2.7-4.2 mmol/L]). CSF Gram stain results showed gram-positive diplococci resembling Streptococcus pneumoniae. CSF samples inoculated onto chocolate agar showed microbial growth that was further found to contain optochin-resistant \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci. Inhouse real-time PCR on CSF and colonies, targeting the specific gene for S. pneumoniae, were negative. The colonies were finally identified as S. suis by using ApiStrep20 (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'\u00c9toile, France) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry with a log (score) value of spectra >2.3 (cutoff \u22652.0). Both patients achieved overall recovery after a complete course of intravenous ampicillin (patient 1) or ceftriaxone (patient 2), but a mild hearing deficit acquired during the infection remained for both patients.We retrieved only strain Ss1223, isolated from patient 2, for further investigation. By using slide agglutination with type-specific hyperimmune serum and specific multiplex PCR (4), we identified the Ss1223 strain as S. suis serotype 2. We performed whole-genome sequencing by",
