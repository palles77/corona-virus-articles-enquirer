The spike (S) protein, especially receptorbinding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, plays important roles in the prevention of SARS infection, and is thus an important component in SARS vaccine development. In this study, we expressed a 219-mer (residues 318-536) RBD protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (RBD219-CHO), and tested its immune responses and protective immunity in a mouse model. The results showed that this recombinant protein was correctly folded, being able to maintain intact conformation and authentic antigenicity. It could induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses and high titers of neutralizing antibodies in the vaccinated mice. RBD219-CHO protein elicited potent protective immunity that protected all vaccinated mice from SARS-CoV challenge. These results suggest that the recombinant RBD219-CHO protein has great potential for the development of an effective and safe SARS subunit vaccine.",

Transmission of SARS-CoV from humans to humans led to the global outbreak of SARS in 2003 (39, 44, 45, 52) . Though SARS is currently under control, it is necessary to develop effective and safe vaccines for the prevention of future SARS outbreaks that may arise from animal reservoirs or accidentally due to laboratory virus escape.",

A variety of SARS vaccines have been tested in animals, including monkeys, ferrets, mice, and hamsters (1, 7, 9, 20, 33, 48, 49) , and some of them have been evaluated in humans (42) . These vaccines may target different antigens of the virus, but most of them are based on the spike (S) protein. It has been reported that an adenovirus-based vaccine expressing S protein prevented pneumonia in ferrets after SARS-CoV challenge, and stimulated potent immune responses in macaques (36) . A recombinant SARS S-protein elicits neutralizing antibodies and protection in mice (29) . Specific humoral and cellular immune responses and=or protection could be induced by SARS S DNA vaccines via different vaccination routes (28, 55) . A SARS-CoV-like particle carrying the S protein protected mice from virus challenge (40) . These reports suggest that the S protein plays an important role in the prevention of SARS infection (3) .",

However, one potential disadvantage of this vaccine candidate is that the Fc tag, which was added to the C-terminus of RBD193 in the hope of increasing immunogenicity by binding Fc-tagged immunogen to the Fc receptor on antigen-presenting cells (5, 47, 57) , may cause adverse effects when used as a vaccine component in humans. When we expressed a recombinant 193-mer RBD (residues 318-510) without fusing Fc (RBD193-CHO) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells, it induced RBDspecific immune responses and neutralizing antibodies, but could not fully protect vaccinated mice from SARS-CoV challenge, with virus replication detected in two of five vaccinated mice (15) .",

The culture medium was replaced by fresh OPTI-MEM I Reduced-Serum Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) 10 h later, and the supernatant was collected 72 h post-transfection. Culture supernatant containing expressed protein was added to protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Applied Science) and purified using His columns (Promega, Madison, WI).

Viral titers were expressed as log 10 TCID 50 =g of tissue, with a lowest detection limit of 1.5 log 10 TCID 50 =g.

Splenocytes were stimulated with N50 and N60 peptides specific to CD8 \u00fe T (CTL) cells and CD4 \u00fe T (Th) cells, respectively, in the RBD of SARS-CoV (30) . For further detection of the cellular immune response, purified RBD protein was also used for stimulation with a final concentration of 1 mg=mL. As shown in Table 1 , RBD219-CHO induced RBD-specific CTL responses, with a particularly high frequency of IL-2-producing CD8 \u00fe (CTL) cells under the stimulation of the CTL peptide N50. Evaluation of Th-cell responses upon stimulation with the N60 peptide indicated that RBD219-CHO protein may elicit relatively higher levels of Th-1 response, as represented by the production of high numbers of IL-2-presenting T cells, in addition to the induction of Th-2 response, which was indicated by the presence of IL-4-secreting T cells in the spleens of vaccinated mice. The results in Table 1 also show that the cellular immune responses induced by RBD219-CHO protein stimulation were generally higher than those elicited by the CTL peptide N50 or Th peptide N60 stimulation alone, probably because the recombinant protein covering the RBD region contains much more CTL and=or Th epitopes. In contrast, only a background level of cellular response was detected in the splenocytes of mice from the PBS controls (Table 1) , or the cells stimulated with the supernatants of CHO culture only (data not shown). These data suggest that the expressed RBD219-CHO protein was able to induce a relatively high level of cellular immune response in the vaccinated mice.

            "text": "We previously reported that a recombinant protein containing a 193-aa RBD with Fc tag (RBD193-Fc) induced highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and protective immunity in vaccinated animals (14) . In order to eliminate any potential adverse effects that might be induced by RBD193-Fc when used as a vaccine component in humans, we have expressed several RBD proteins with the Fc tag removed in mammalian cells 293T (RBD-293T) and CHO-K1 (RBD193-CHO), insect cells Sf9 (RBD-Sf9),. and E. coli (RBD-Ec). Unlike RBD proteins expressed in 293T, Sf9, and E. coli, that may induce complete protection against live SARS-CoV challenge in vaccinated mice, the 193-aa RBD protein expressed in CHO-K1 cells (RBD193-CHO) protected a majority of the mice from virus challenge, with virus replication detected in two of five mice (13, 15) . When we expressed a 219-mer RBD protein in the same cell line of CHO-K1 (RBD219-CHO), the newly-designed protein elicited high titers of RBD-specific antibodies with potent neutralizing activity against both SARS pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV infection in cell cultures in vitro. Like rRBD proteins expressed in 293T, Sf9, and E. coli cells, RBD219-CHO was able to protect all vaccinated mice against SARS-CoV challenge in vivo (Fig. 5) . Similarly to other rRBD proteins expressed above, this mammalian cell CHO-K1-expressed RBD protein without the Fc fusion tag reacted with the majority of the mAbs specific for the conformational and linear epitopes in RBD, suggesting that it maintains intact conformation and proper antigenicity (Fig. 2) . Similarly to RBD193-CHO protein, a stable cell line could be established in the CHO-K1 cell lines for long-term expression of the RBD219-CHO protein (data not shown). The RBD219-CHO protein (residues 318-536) was expressed with an extension of 26 residues at the C terminus of the RBD193-CHO protein (residues 318-510). This extended fragment may assist RBD to refold into a more stable or more immunogenic conformation to induce more potent protective immunity in the vaccinated animals. Future comparison of the structure and immune responses and long-term protection of these two proteins is warranted.",

Both CTL and Th-1=Th-2 responses were detected in this study in RBD219-CHO-vaccinated mouse splenocytes, more evidence of the high immunogenicity and antigenicity of the expressed RBD protein when used as a vaccine candidate (Table 1) . Although both humoral and cellular immune responses are important for suppression of SARS-CoV infection, neutralizing antibodies may be the key factor for protecting mice from subsequent virus challenge (13, 14, 50) . Long-term protection mediated by neutralizing antibodies could be achieved by immunization of mice with a single dose of an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) recombinant bearing S protein (VSV-S) (34) . A recombinant secreted protein containing 14-762 residues of the S protein could provide sufficient neutralizing antibodies to protect against SARS-CoV infection (2) . The protective immunity seen in the mice vaccinated with an S protein-expressing DNA vaccine was mediated by humoral immunity rather than by a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism (55) .

High titers of neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity could be induced by subunit vaccines based on the RBD protein with or without fusion segments (14, 56) . However, RBD-based vaccines without the fusion tag would eliminate any potential adverse effects induced by fusion proteins when used in humans (13) . In agreement with our previous reports, the results of this study further confirm that the recombinant RBD protein without the Fc fusion fragment is able to induce potent neutralizing antibody responses and protection against infection by SARS-CoV, suggesting the possibility of the development of RBD subunit-based vaccines for SARS prevention.",
