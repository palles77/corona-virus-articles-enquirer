            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population. The most obvious symptom related to the disease is inflammation and deformation of the joints, caused by an inflammatory attack of cartilage. However, symptoms originating from cartilage tissue in the nose and throat are also present. Joints that are located in the area around the larynx (the cricothyroid and cricolaryngeal joints) are affected in some patients and in a thorough examination 60% of RA patients were found to present signs of laryngeal involvement [1] . In addition, reports of destruction of nasal cartilage causing saddle nose deformity or septal perforation have been demonstrated in seronegative as well as seropositive patients [2] [3] [4] . Nasal tissue has in several cases been analysed for vasculitis with negative result, despite signs of Raynaud's phenomenon in a few. Cartilage tissue, however, was never investigated. Septal perforation has also been reported in related entities such as psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease [4] . The nasal and tracheolaryngeal symptoms found in RA patients have been poorly investi-gated and the target antigen causing inflammation and/or cartilage destruction has not been defined. However, collagen type II (CII) has been proven in several publications to be involved in RA pathogenesis, as has collagen type IX (CIX) and type XI (CXI) [5] [6] [7] [8] . In addition, antibodies to CIX and CXI, but not CII, have been found in patients with cartilage graft resorption in nasal surgery, indicating that CIX and CXI have a role in nasal cartilage destruction [9] .",

Recent publications from our group also describe a prominent role for matrilin-1, both in animal models mimicking symptoms of relapsing polychondritis (MIRPmatrilin-1 induced relapsing polychondritis) [17] and in humans [18] .

In recent years pristane, a mineral oil (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane), has also been used to induce arthritis in mice and rats [20, 21] . It needs to be emphasized, however, that pristaneinduced arthritis in mice and rats are two different models with different induction requirements and different biology and therefore cannot be compared directly [21] . The pristane-induced arthritis model (PIA) in the rat has many similarities to the phenotypes found in CIA but differences have also been reported. In both models severe paw arthritis is induced with similar histology [21, 22] . T cells have been proven to be important in both models [23] as has the influence of both MHC and non-MHC genes; however, different MHC genes seem to be involved in disease susceptibility [21, 24, 25] . Anti-CII antibodies, a common feature of CIA, have so far not been detected in PIA. Similarly to PIA use of incomplete Freund's adjuvant (oil-induced arthritis), has been described to induce peripheral arthritis [26, 27] .",

            "text": "CIA and PIA are both established models for the human disease RA. However, some clinical and laboratory differences between these models have been reported. In this paper we present a major difference concerning target antigens and tissues. In CIA extra-articular cartilage as well as joint cartilage were affected, while pristane-induced cartilage inflammation was restricted to joints. In addition, rats with inflammation in the nasal cartilage generated significantly higher levels of antibodies to matrilin-1 and to CII than rats with no inflammation. We also show that nasal CII vaccination prior to CII immunization in rats affect extra-articular cartilage destruction as evidenced by lower antibody responses to matrilin-1. The presence of nasal and laryngeal inflammation when immunizing with CII is most probably induced primarily by CII, since we did not detect any matrilin-1 in the CII preparation used for immunization. Secondary to induction, and caused by cartilage destruction and release of fragments, we propose that matrilin-1 becomes an important target antigen and that anti-bodies to matrilin-1 further nourish the inflammatory process in extra-articular cartilage. Thus, CII immunization induces matrilin-1 antibodies, which most probably participate in the subsequent inflammatory process detected in nasal and laryngeal cartilage. The lack of inflammation in ear cartilage could be explained by the fact that this is an elastic cartilage without any easily accessible CII in the perichondrium and, in addition, the expression of matrilin-1 in auricular cartilage is very low [19] . Of the three rat strains investigated, LEW.1A was found to respond with the highest antibody levels to matrilin-1 at all time points. Antibodies to matrilin-1 were also detected in the LEW.1F strain, despite the lack of arthritis and a low anticollagen response, indicating the CII response in CIA to be high enough to induce subclinical inflammation in laryngeal and/or nasal tissue not detected by histology but which initiates a secondary response to matrilin-1. This hypothesis is likely, as mild arthritis in the joints have been found in 20% of LEW.1F rats when immunized with CII in a similar experiment in our laboratory (Lu, unpublished observation ). An alternative explanation could be that despite a negative Western blot, a minor contamination of matrilin-1 is present in the CII preparation. A transient antimatrilin-1 response was found in the DA rats supporting the role of matrilin-1 in the secondary phase of disease since DA rats do not respond clinically to matrilin-1 immunization while both LEW strains are susceptible [17] . The lack of significant findings in mice, histological or serological (antimatrilin-1 antibodies), could depend on species variations since different cartilage proteins might be present in different concentrations in the various cartilaginous tissues depending on the species examined.",

The method has proven successful in ameliorating arthritis in rats as well as mice [30, 32] . However, according to our results, care should be taken not to induce a response to new target antigens, such as matrilin-1, by the locally induced nasal inflammation. We have shown recently that the level of antibodies to matrilin-1 is increased in a subgroup of patients with relapsing polychondritis, especially in those individuals with severe respiratory distress [18] . On the other hand, we show in this study that the antibody response to matrilin-1 is significantly lower in the CIA rats treated with nasal instillations of CII than in the controls. This indicates a decreased inflammatory activity to extraarticular cartilage, which is also most probably of benefit to the patients, particularly those with a predisposition to develop nasal or respiratory symptoms. Consequently, titration of the nasally instilled protein and a thorough control of its local effects are of great importance.",
