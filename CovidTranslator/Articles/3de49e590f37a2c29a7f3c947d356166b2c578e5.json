Lubricating the eyes and hair around frequently immediately after birth until the hair grows in a more controlled manner can help.

The treatment of choice for dermoids is surgical removal via keratectomy, but given the thinness of the guinea pig cornea ( Table 2) , this treatment should be undertaken with great care.

They have also been noted to have an unusually low blink rate. 2, 5 This is compounded by their typical housing, in a bedded enclosure with straw and hay at eye level. In a survey of 1000 guinea pigs, 4.7% had conjunctivitis, which was frequently secondary to a traumatic injury from a foreign body. 11 This had also been seen in a previous survey of guinea pigs. 1 It has been theorized that the corneal vessels and lymphoid tissue unique to guinea pigs eyes were an evolved strategy over increased blinking and discomfort seen in other animals. That being said, foreign bodies should still be taken seriously and treated promptly. Per Williams and Sullivan (2010), these foreign bodies, along with congenital trichiasis, seemed to be the most irritating for the animals.",

The presence of chromodacryorrhea should not be ignored, as it is not a normal finding. As discussed, it may be caused by environmental stress, physical illness, or underlying disease. Furthermore, even when not hypersecreted, porphyrins are labile until photic energy. Exposure to high-intensity light induced necrosis of the glandular cells in a study on a research population of Wistar rats. 33 The injury appeared to be caused by the creation of free radicals within glandular cells, probably as a result of photodynamic action on the porphyrins in the gland.

Clinically, these opacities are subepithelial (associated with abnormal epithelial basement membrane, Bowman layer). They vary from a few punctate opacities only visible with a slit lamp to marked dense opacities covering a majority of the corneal surface (Fig. 5) . A thorough ophthalmologic and histopathological study was performed on Fischer-344 (F344) rats that demonstrated a high incidence of corneal basement membrane dystrophy. 34 In the most severely affected Ocular Surface Disease in Rodents strains, this correlated to a systemic basement membrane disorder. It was speculated that these opacities are relatively under-reported for several reasons, and in this study anywhere from 50% to 100% of rats examined from various breeders had corneal dystrophy. Thankfully, these opacifications did not appear to cause the animals discomfort or have an adverse effect on normal physiologic function. However, in people, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy is associated with recurrent corneal erosions. 35 F344 rat strains are also unusually prone to intraocular tumor, which may manifest as a pigmented opacity in the cornea. Orbital malignant schwannomas and amelanotic melanoma are reported. 36 ",
