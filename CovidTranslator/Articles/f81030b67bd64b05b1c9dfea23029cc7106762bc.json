Alzheimer disease shares many of the same inflammatory changes, although cause and effect are less clear. This chapter follows the pathways of Fig. 1 .2 further by examining the role of infections and inflammatory agents in vascular disease and Alzheimer disease and selected cancers. Pharmacologic interventions through NSAIDs and anti-coagulant drugs further establish the inflammatory mechanisms in vascular disease and may extend to Alzheimer disease. These examples are discussed in relation to Query II (Section 1.1) that inflammation causes bystander damage and Query III that environmental pathogens and inflammogens influence chronic diseases with inflammatory processes through bystander damage (Section 1.4).",

From epidemiologic and pathologic studies, chronic infections may be primary causes or co-factors of inflammation in vascular disease. This controversial concept has been discussed for a century or more (Frothingham, 1911) . The hypothesis of inflammation as a co-factor is strongest in human arterial disease, because prodromal microscopic foci of oxidized lipids and activated macrophages are present before birth (Section 1.5.3.1). The evidence for the role of infections in arterial disease, while considerable and supported by animal models, is still largely circumstantial for humans.",

Until about 1950, rheumatic fever from 'strep' infections was still an important cause of damage to heart valves. In particular, streptococcal A substrains cause high incidence of endocarditis and mitral valve scarring (Bispo, 2000; Stollerman, 1997; Wilson, 1940) . Rheumatic fever with mitral damage is life-shortening (Jones, 1956) . In the 1930s, for example, few survivors of childhood infections lived to age 40, and most died within 15 years of infection (Wilson, 1940, p. 272) . Rheumatic heart disease has become rarer in developed countries from public health improvements and, then after 1950, the availability of antibiotics. However, heart valves without rheumatic disease often harbor a diverse bacterial flora (see below).",

Among U.S. Civil War veterans, infectious disease in early adulthood has been associated with heart and respiratory problems after age 50 (Costa, 2000) .

Other examples are discussed in Crimmins and Finch (2006a) . Considered over most of the 20 th century, the associations of prior infections on later mortality may explain up to nearly 25% of the decline of both morbid and mortal conditions at later ages (Costa, 2000) . Relationships of early and later age mortality in birth cohorts are developed further below.

Peripheral arteries also show effects of infections. Children with acute respiratory infections had impaired regulation of the brachial artery endothelium, by the flow-mediated vasodilation test (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, or ALSPAC Study, Fig. 2.3) . The effects of infection may have persisted for a year in some individuals (the statistical significance was P<0.06) (Charakida et al, 2005) . Longitudinal follow-up continues.

Chronic endotoxin also required hyperlipidemia to accelerate atherogenesis (Engelmann et al, 2006) . The apoE-knockout (\u2212/\u2212) mouse is an important model, with greatly elevated cholesterol on non-atherogenic diets that promote progressive arterial lesions not found in normal mice. ApoE knockouts develop aortic plaques by 4 months, followed by vascular rigidity and aneurysms (Wang, 2005 , Wouters et al, 2005 . Moreover, the lipidemia-induced lesions depend on pathogen-signaling pathways via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) linked to MyD88, an adaptor that activates kinases (Laberge et al, 2005) (Chapter 5, Fig. 5.4 ). The double apoE and MyD88 knockout mouse had much small aortic lesions, with fewer macrophages and lower chemokines In apoE knockouts, 120",

Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; population-based study, Bristol UK region) evaluates environmental and genetic influences on health and development. Vascular endothelial function was evaluated sonographically by flow-mediated constriction (FMD) of the brachial artery diameter. Six hundred Ss aged 10 years were assessed for health; exclusions asthma and chronic infections, or use of antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs; acute infections (AI) were 93% upper respiratory. About 1 year later, there was a reassessment of 50 controls without infection; of 40, prior with acute infection, but without infection since first visit. The AI group FMD response was slightly lower on the second visit (P < 0.06), suggesting a subgroup with persistent endothelial damage. (Redrawn from Charakida et al, 2005.) C. pneumoniae caused rapid vascular endothelial damage (aortic contractility, 2-6 weeks after infection) (Liuba et al, 2000) . Subsequently, the arterial wall thickens with increased ROS production. The convergence of hyperlipidemia in infection and arterial disease through pathogen-activated pathways suggests that atherogenesis is bystander outcome of the indispensable host defense mechanisms. Future case control studies with longitudinal follow-up may be more conclusive. We may learn how to quantify effects of infections on vascular damage by the intensity and duration. There could be a threshold for acute infections of sufficient brevity that do not cause enduring damage. We may anticipate some dose-duration relationships in chronic subclinical infections and arterial disease that are like the 'pack-years of smoking' in relation to carotid thickening, as discussed below ( Fig. 2.6 ) and lung cancer. The pathogen burden is indicated by the scaling of vascular event risk to the number of seropositivities, discussed above (Espinola-Klein, 2002; Georges et al, 2003; Zhu et al, 2000) . Both research groups use similar terminology, 'pathologic burden' (Zhu et al, 2000) and 'infectious burden' (Espinola-Klein, 2002) , to represent seropositivities, which does not inform on whether infections are active. I suggest the alternative term inflammatory burden to more comprehensively represent these long-term inflammatory influences. Besides infections, the inflammatory burden includes non-infectious inflammogens such as smoke and other aerosols and dietary AGEs produced during cooking (see below). These complexities are well expressed by Stephen Epstein and colleagues:",

In rabbits, periodontitis induced by P. gingivalis increased aortic lipid deposits in proportion to the severity of periodontitis ( Jain et al, 2003) . P. gingivalis generally forms biofilms beneath the gingiva and can invade oral epithelia and vascular endothelial cells. Activation of Toll receptors by P. gingivalis is associated with increased IL-1, TNF\u03b1, prostaglandin E 2 , and leukocyte adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) (Choi et al, 2005a; Chun et al, 2005; Hajishengallis et al, 2004) . The associations with vascular disease are considered circumstantial (see the analysis of 14 studies) (Kolltveit and Eriksen, 2001) , because few studies measured infections by serology or bioassay (Danesh et al, 1999) ; smoking adds other confounds (Hujoel et al, 2000) . In ARIC, 68% were seropositive for one or more of 17 bacterial species associated with periodontal disease (Beck et al, 2005) . High antibody titers to \u22651 oral pathogen were associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease, particularly in never-smokers. However, there were no associations of periodontal disease with prevalent cardiovascular disease after adjusting for covariates. Prospective studies should include the individual histories of oral health, smoking, and other lifestyle covariates; multiple time samples of serology for the spectrum of major pathogens; and screening for genetic polymorphisms in IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which are associated with risk of periodontal disease (Lopez et al, 2005) .",

The gut epithelial cells in the crypts of Lieberkuhn have tight junctions (zona occludens) that maintain characteristic epithelial cell polarity as part of the barrier to the body cavity and prevent leakage of gut contents (Mullin et al, 2005) . Cholera and other pathogenic bacteria alter this vital tight junction barrier. In aging rats, tight junctions become leakier, as assayed by transcolonic epithelial permeability; these aging effects were greater on high fat diets (Mullin et al, 2002) (Fig. 2.5A ). The aging gut may have increased leakage, allowing entry of endotoxins into the circulation. As a precedent, CRP elevations are common in inflammatory bowel disease (Poullis et al, 2002) . At some threshold, leakage of endotoxins could cause elevations of blood CRP and other acute phase proteins (Section 1.7).",

Stem cell depletion may contribute to these aging changes. Epithelial cells in the crypts of Lieberkuhn proliferate throughout life and are extruded at the tips of the intestinal villi. The crypt stem cells (Potten et al, 2001; Potten et al, 2003) apparently become stochastically depleted during aging (Finch and Kirkwood, 2000, pp. 132-137; Martin, 1998) . Radiation and some carcinogens accelerate the loss of stem cells and increase the incidence of abnormal crypts (Magnuson et al, 2000; Martin, 1998) . Alternately, TNF\u03b1 can alter tight-junction permeability via NF-\u03baB activation, as implicated in Crohn's disease and other chronic intestinal inflammations.

Gut abnormalities in old worms (C. elegans).The width of the pharynx increases from packed wads of bacteria (black arrowheads), which shows cellular deterioration (white arrowheads). (Directly from Garigan et al, 2002.) OP50 is mildly pathogenic is now 40 years old (Croll and Yarwood, 1977; De Cuyper and Vanfleteren, 1982; Hansen et al, 1964) : \"The longer life span in the absence of bacteria suggests a possible toxicity of bacterial products in the monoxenic cultures\" (Hansen and Yarwood, 1964, p. 629) . Elimination of live bacteria from the diet increases life spans. A diet of UVkilled bacteria delayed the pharyngeal pack-up of bacteria (Garigan et al, 2002) and increased life spans up to 55%, without loss of fecundity (Gems and Riddle, 2000) . Moreover, axenic growth on sterile media supplemented with nutrients doubled the life span (Croll et al, 1977; De Cuyper and Vanfleteren, 1982; Houthoofd et al, 2002; Houthoofd et al, 2004) . The axenic cultures maintained the rate of pharyngeal pumping to later ages and increased stress resistance, but at the expense of lower fecundity (Croll et al, 1977; Houthoofd et al, 2002) . Switching from axenic to bacterial media after larval maturation eliminated the longevity benefit; conversely, raising larvae on bacteria followed by brief antibiotic treatment before transfer to axenic media increased longevity almost as much as growth on sterile media throughout life (De Cuyper and Vanfleteren, 1982) . However, these benefits are due not only to the elimination of bacterial toxicity, because this axenic medium was deficient in ubiquinone, a micronutrient obtained from the bacterial diet ( Jonassen et al, 2003; Larsen et al, 2002) .",

Even lab animal bedding materials can contain appreciable bacterial endotoxin and (1->3)-\u03b2-D-glucan from bacteria, molds, and plants. When inhaled, these common aerobiosols induce chronic inflammation (Ewaldsson et al, 2002) . Humans also experience varying exposures to bioaerosols according to occupation and income, which can be a factor in the strong socio-demographic gradients in longevity. Bioaerosols are now a major concern of industrial safety (Burrell, 1994; Menetrez et al, 2001) , but are still a hazard of agricultural workers. Workers in sewage plants and garbage collectors also suffer from inhalants that cause chronic systemic inflammation and elevated CRP (Rylander, 1977) . Farm workers entering a swine confinement building had rapid elevations of blood complement C3 peaking at 1 h, followed by peak CRP at 2 h (Hoffmann et al, 2003) . The smokers in this group had greater responses. Besides airborne live bacteria and fungi, non-viable bioaerosols may contain endotoxins of fecal origin. A specific role of LPS inhalation was shown by the induction of plasma CRP and other inflammatory responses with well-defined dose responses (Michel et al, 1997; Thorn, 2001) . The aerosol-vascular disease association is relevant to the historical increase of human longevity during the developments of public sanitation (Section 2.5) and to earlier phases of human evolution as population density increased and encountered increasing exposure to infections, inflammogens, and especially to domestic smoke for cooking and heating (Section 6.2). Genetic risk factors for resistance to domestic smoke and other types of air pollution may have evolved during this time. Curiously, European populations have a high prevalence of a null allele (GSTM1*0) of glutathione-S-transferase M1. GST makes the key antioxidant glutathione ( Fig. 1.11 ) and belongs to a superfamily of xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes with potential importance to human evolution (Section 6.4.2). The M1*0 homozygotes (equivalent to GSTM1 knockout) have impaired lung functions as children and a higher risk of asthma (Peden, 2005).",

As discussed in Section 1.4.2, advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) and advanced lipid oxidation endproducts (ALEs) are produced endogenously from chemical reactions of glucose and other reducing sugars with peptide lysine and arginine, which are proinflammatory, atherogenic, and carcinogenic (Kikugawa, 2004; Skog et al, 1998; Vlassara et al, 2002) . This saga began in 1912 with Louis Maillard's discovery of chemical reactions between amino acids and glucose that lead to the loss of lysine and the formation of brownish condensation products (Finot, 2005; Maillard, 1912; Nursten, 2005) . These reactions are the basis for browning of foods by broiling, or frying, which can increase AGE content 3-to 5-fold (Table 2 .1) (Goldberg et al, 2004) . AGEs and ALEs are also formed during food processing and storage. AGEs ingested from cooked foods are detected by immunoreactivity for the glycation adduct CML (N-carboxymethyl-lysine) ( Table 2 .1). In healthy adults, plasma CML strongly correlated with the dietary intake of AGE over a 3-fold range (Urribari et al, 2005) .",

The lesions of the high-AGE diet group had more arterial foam cells and receptors for AGE (RAGE) . In another mouse model, 6 months on a high-AGE/high-fat diet induced type-2 diabetes, with impaired glucose regulation and insulin insensitivity (Sandu et al, 2005) . The low-AGE/high-fat controls had normal glucose regulation despite similar adiposity. Plasma 8-isoprostane, a marker of lipid oxidation, was increased by the high-AGE diet.

One 'low-AGE' diet had 90% fewer AGEs than the 'high-AGE' diet, but this level still could be bioactive (Sandu et al, 2005) . Casein, a widely used protein in chows, yields AGEs during industrial preparation (Gilani et al, 2005) (Jing and Kitts, 2002) . Speculatively, low-grade, slow AGE side effects may lurk in diets containing casein and other milk-derived products as protein sources. The common nephropathy of aging F344 rats was greatly reduced by feeding on chows containing soy protein versus casein or lactalbumin (Shimokawa et al, 1993b) , and median life span was 15% longer (Iwasaki et al, 1988) . These findings point to an expanding role of dietary AGEs in atherosclerosis and diabetes, and support their designation as glycotoxins ' (Koschinsky et al, 1997; Vlassara, 2005) . Vlassara hypothesizes that dietary AGEs, possibly synergizing with tobacco and other environmental inflammogens, sustain oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. The AGE receptors (RAGEs) that activate signaling pathways with PI3K (Section 1.3.3) may link dietary glycotoxins to longevity pathways that involve insulin/IGF-1 signaling ( Fig. 1.3A ) and that are also implicated in vascular disease (Fig 1.3B ).",

Caramel coloring and flavorings have been added to commercial foods and beverages for more than a century (Chappel and Howell, 1992; Nursten, 2005) . These preferences may have been important in the development of cooking during the last half million years when early humans learned to control fire (Section 6.2). Cooking could have enhanced health by killing parasites and infectious organisms in animal tissues. Moreover, cooking increases the usability of many plants as foods by increasing digestibility and by inactivating toxins that are widely found, e.g., cassava and potatoes. (De Bry, 1994) suggests that early humans used Maillard products as olfactory cues to indicate when tubers with heat-sensitive toxins were sufficiently cooked. Nonetheless, evolution of the omnivorous human diet would have greatly increased exposure to toxins, implying the importance of detoxification mechanisms to enable these new foraging strategies (Sections 3.7 and 6.2.3).",

Anonymous reviewers of these papers questioned the importance of vascular disease in deaths before the modern era. However, all evidence points to vascular disease as ancient and ubiquitous \". . . its pattern has always been the same regardless of race, diet, and the stresses of survival\" (Magee, 1998, p. 663) . The 5,300 year old Tyrolean \"iceman\" of the Bronze Age evidenced carotid artery calcification (Murphy et al, 2003) , which is common in advanced atherosclerosis ( Fig. 1 .13) (Section 1.5.3.1) and is an independent risk factor of vascular mortality (Doherty et al, 2003; Sangiorgi et al, 1998) . Two millennia later, Egyptian mummies of the 18 th dynasty preserved calcified arteries and other vascular pathology (Ruffer, 1911) . Most large arteries (16/24) in this sample met criteria for atherosclerosis, with half of these specimens showing vascular calcification (9/16). By the European Middle Ages, anatomists were describing arteriosclerosis as \"natural to old age\" (Long, 1933) . Approaching the modern era, the records, scarce as they are, also show cardiovascular disease as a major cause of death in older adult ages. In 19 th and mid-20 th century England and Sweden, which had low life expectancy, cardiovascular disease was one of the two most important causes of mortality at the oldest ages (Preston et al, 1972; Preston, 1976) . For cohorts born after the first decade of the 1800s, the deaths recognized as due to cardiovascular diseases exceed those attributed to infectious conditions. From the earliest date in Sweden, deaths from cardiovascular disease are two times higher than from infectious conditions for those 70-74. For the U.S. Civil War, Fogel and colleagues compared doctors' reports of heart disease from Union Army veterans aged 65 and over in 1910 versus veterans of the same age in 1983. Heart disease was nearly twice as prevalent in the U.S. Civil War Veterans (76% vs. 40%, age-adjusted) (Fogel, 2004, p. 31) . William Osler's statement from 1892 still holds true today, \"Longevity is a vascular question, which has been well expressed in the axiom that 'a man is as old as his arteries.' To a majority of men, death comes primarily or secondarily through this portal.\" (Osler, 1892, p. 664).",

According to our 'cohort morbidity hypothesis,' exposure to infections early in life causes chronic infections that, in turn, promote vascular disease, leading to earlier mortality. Tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and other gastro-intestinal pathogens noted above are among many chronic infections that have recently diminished. The human environment in rural and urban areas alike was typically filthy by modern standards, with gross continuing exposure to human and animal feces. Running water was not available for convenient washing and bathing. Conditions gradually improved with national efforts in public hygiene even before the identification of infectious pathogens and development of immunization at the end of the 19 th century. Besides the infectious environment, it was difficult to keep clothes clean and free of ectoparasites, especially before the availability of cheap cotton for clothing, which is easier to wash than wool or leather. Improved nutrition was another major factor in resistance to infectious conditions, due to agricultural improvements and the development of national transport systems of canal and rail (Fogel and Costa, 1997; Fogel, 2004; McKeown, 1976) .",

As early age mortality declined, so did later age mortality in the survivors, seven decades later. The increased life expectancy at age 70 was clear in Sweden by 1850 ( Fig. 2.7C ). These findings support my early estimate that the steady historical increase in the adult age when mortality reaches 1% implies a slowing of aging processes (Finch, 1969, p.12 ).",

Infant mortality is largely attributed to infections. A key feature of this analysis is the comparison of birth cohort, followed throughout life, with the same ages in the corresponding periods. The results are consistent across these four countries: Most of the variance in old age mortality is explained by the early mortality in that birth cohort, 87-96%. The early and later mortality association of cohorts was much stronger than for periods. At a given year, the older adults in a population were born seven decades before the children and had experienced different environments that had a stronger effect on their mortality than in the current environment. Mortality of intermediate adult ages also did not predict old age mortality. The overall mortality curves shift downward quite uniformly as early mortality improves ( Fig. 2.7A ). Separate analysis of males and females also showed consistent associations in cohorts between early and later mortality (Crimmins and Finch, 2006b) . Many specific mechanisms can be considered in cohort morbidity through which recurrent exposure to acute infections or continiued chronic infections accelerates atherosclerosis as well as causing direct damage to heart valves and myocardium (focal lesions and diffuse fibrosis).

Infections and inflammation cause the reallocation of metabolic resources and energy from growth ( Fig. 1.2B) , as discussed in detail in Chapter 4. There are also associations of inflammatory genes with fetal growth (TNF\u03b1-308 G/G is more prevalent in lower birthweights) (Casano-Sancho et al, 2006 ) (Section et al 4.10.1).

Malaria and possibly other maternal infections can retard fetal growth and increase fetal cytokines (Moormann et al, 1999) (Section 4.5). Smaller babies may have lower resistance to environmental pathogens. These possibilities are not included in the Barker hypothesis of fetal origins that focused on maternal malnutrition as the main cause of the fetal retardation effect on later vascular disease (Barker, 2004) , discussed at length in Chapter 4.

B6 males had mean life spans of 18 m in 1948 -1956 (Russell, 1966 that gradually increased to the present range of 26-30 m (Finch, 1972; Kunstyr and Leuenberger, 1975) (Fig. 2.9.A, B) . Survival curves became increasingly 'rectangularized' and right-shifted: Sporadic deaths before 20 m decreased, while maximum longevity increased from 30 to 44 m (Finch, 1969; Tanaka et al, 2000; Turturro et al, 2002) . These right-shifts of mortality indicate reduction of infections and match those of human populations as health improved (Fig. 1.1A) . Unfortunately, the pathology of aging was not well documented for B6 mice during this transition. In modern colonies of B6 mice, the cumulative incidence of cardiomyopathy is about 40% by 24 m (Schriner et al, NYC,1966 NYC, -1971 ; sentinel cohort of retired male breeders). B. Survival curves of C57BL/6J male mice, from author's colony (Finch et al, 1969; Finch, 1972a) and the Jackson Laboratory (Russell, 1966) . Another striking example is the greatly improved longevity of dwarf mice with growth hormone deficiency. Thirty years ago, the Snell dwarf mouse was considered a model for accelerated aging because of short life span (< 6 m) and wizened appearance with gray hair, cataracts, and early onset tumors (Fabris et al, 1972 ) (Chapter 5, Table 5 .3, footnote c). However, in the past decade with improved husbandry, dwarf mice have 'switched teams' to become models of slow aging, with life spans over 4 y and delayed onset of tumors. Gray hair is not common in contemporary dwarf mice and, in any case, is not a general trait of aging in B6 mice or other strains (Finch, 1973b) . Husbandry improvements that enabled this remarkable transformation probably include reduced infections (see below) and better vivarium temperature control.",

In the 1960s, Wexler and colleagues documented in detail that repetitive mating can accelerate arterial degeneration in males as well as females (Wexler and Miller, 1958, 1960; Wexler and True, 1963; Wexler, 1964; Wexler, 1976) . These studies employed standard rat stocks (Holtzman, Long-Evans, Sprague-Dawley, Wistar) fed on low fat (4%) diets. Lesions developed in coronary and carotid arteries in proportion to the breeding experience. Heart valve damage was common. ACTH injections or restraint stress also accelerated spontaneous atherosclerosis. Wexler and colleagues postulated that the repetitive mating caused severe stress. It is impossible to define the conditions in Wexler's colony that caused this level of stress during reproduction. Myocardial fibrosis was also associated with the severe coronary artery changes. In current clinical practice, myocardial fibrosis is associated with arrhythmias and sudden death (Siwik and Colucci, 2004; Zannad and Radauceanu, 2005) .",

Coronary artery stenosis to varying degrees was concurrent with myocardial fibrosis. In the Edinburgh colony, occlusive CAD with intimal plaques was present in 60% of rats by 17 m on a low-fat diet, causing complete blockage of a coronary vessel in some rats (Humphreys, 1957) .

Improvements at the Jackson Laboratory occurred after 1959 when the Pedigreed Expansion Stock (begun in 1948) was moved to cleaner facilities (Russell, 1966) . Longevity increases were not the result of intentional selection for longevity, although routine culling of sickly pups should lower overall mortality by reducing the pool of infections. The lack of correlation between life spans of parents and offspring in these early B6 colonies (Gunther Schlager, in Russell op. cit.) can be considered evidence against genetic drift (crosses of B6 and other strains clearly show inheritance of life span) ( Jackson et al, 2002; Finch and Tanzi, 1997) . Cardiomyopathies, nonetheless, may arise more frequently in aging rats maintained on diet restriction with exercise (McCarter et al, 1997) (Section 3.4.2). Dietary fat could be a factor because fatty diets can shorten life span (Chapter 3). The fats fed the first longevity group at Jackson are not known: The composition of the commercial diet was then a 'trade secret' (Elizabeth Russell, pers. comm.) . In 1959, the Jackson Lab switched to Guilford Chow (11% fat, 19% protein), routinely given breeding females to enhance milk production. Chows with 4-5% fat are currently favored for aging studies (Finch et al, 1969; Turturro et al, 2002) .",

Some reported deaths from epidemic infections as merely 'accidental' (Robertson and Ray, 1920) . Until the 1970s, laboratory colonies were often infected with microbial infections and skin parasites. Numerous pathogens were gradually minimized or eliminated, including bacteria (Salmonella, Mycoplasma); viruses [coronavirus; ectromelia (mousepox), mouse hepatitis virus, Sendai virus]; and ectoparasites (mites, pinworms) (Bell et al, 1964; Cotchin and Roe, 1967; Flynn et al, 1965; Miller and Nadon, 2000) . Early colonies often had chronic respiratory disease (CRD) from endemic Mycoplasma 4 recognized by wheezy breathing and crusty noses. While minimizing infections and dietary fat could only increase longevity, we may never know the causes of the extensive myocardial and arterial lesions described above. The Wilens-Sproul colony rats had numerous abscesses ('suppurative lesions') in brain, ears, genitourinary tract, and lungs (Wilens and Sproul, 1938) .",

Chronic lesions of aging approximated those of other rat strains in modern colonies (Bronson, 1990 ) and in the same age ranges: glomerulonephropathy arose before cardiomyopathy and abnormal growths (Simms and Berg, 1957; Simms and Berg, 1962) , and arterial calcification was occasional.

SPF status with minimal mycoplasmas and other pathogens increases fecundity and post-weaning growth and lowers spontaneous mortality (Bell et al, 1964) . However, pathogen loads can fluctuate in SPF colonies with agents carried by humans and other adjacent lab animals (Taylor, 1974; Taylor and Doy, 1975) . Infections are still embarrassingly common within SPF colonies at major research institutions ( Jacoby and Lindsey, 1997). Although stricter barrier facilities can further reduce transmission of external infections, the expense and effort are prohibitive. Germ-free (axenic) animals lacking bacteria are problematic for aging studies: Their adaptive immunity is undeveloped, and their flaccid, grossly enlarged caecums develop fatal constrictions (volvulus) (Gordon et al, 1966) .",

Age-changes in skeletal muscle composition and function observed in 'dirty' colonies are negligible in aging rodents from SPF colonies of the same strains (Florini, 1989) . Moreover, age-changes in rat liver protein oxidation (carbonyl content) disappeared in a subsequent cohort of the same strain of rats obtained 10 years later; these differences were confirmed with stored samples (Stadtman and Levine, 2003) . Lastly, sporadic hippocampal neuron loss in aging may have Preface). The most common agent of CRD is Mycoplasma pulmonis, as finally proven in 1971 with germ-free mice (Cassell, 1982; Lamb, 1975; Lindsey et al, 1985; Nelson, 1967; Slauson and Hahn, 1980) . Other bacteria can cause CRD (Gay et al, 1972; Lamb, 1975) . Mycoplasma are insidiously transmitted in utero and among cage mates; latent infections can erupt in apparently healthy SPF colonies (Lane-Petter et al, 1970) , sometimes activated by Sendai virus, another sporadic scourge of aging colonies (Kay et al, 1979; Schoeb et al, 1985) . been common in early colonies (Landfield et al, 1977; Meaney et al, 1988) but is not obvious currently (Gallagher et al, 1996; Rasmussen et al, 1996) . Variable stress and infections may have been involved. Moreover, early reports of neuron loss (reduced density of large neurons) could be interpreted as neuron atrophy (Fig. 1.7A) .

CDV causes focal lesions of hypothalamic appetite centers with selective loss of leptin receptors, POMC and catecholaminergic neurons in the arcuate nucleus, and hyperplasia of adipocytes and pancreatic islets. Obesity is also induced in other animal models by infections with scrapie (prion disease), Bornavirus, the retrovirus (RAV-7), and AD-36 (human group D adenovirus) (Atkinson et al, 2005; Lyons et al, 2002) . In a recent study impressive for its large subject pools, AD-36 seropositivity was 3-fold more prevalent in obese adults (30% than controls, 11%; 502 Ss); moreover, in 28 twin pairs discordant for AD-36, the seropositive individual was fatter than the co-twin (Atkinson et al, 2005) . Curiously, AD-36 seropositive individuals had lower cholesterol and triglycerides. In vitro, AD-36 infections of adipocytes decreased increased glucose uptake and leptin secretion; these effects depend on transient expression of viral mRNA, but not viral DNA replication (Rathood et al, 2007) . Unlike CDV, no hypothalamic lesions have been found in AD-36 infected mice (Dhurandhar et al, 2000) . Another study of obese men who were otherwise healthy found inverse correlations between insulin sensitivity and seropositivity for common infections (HSV-1 and -2, enterovirus, and C. pneumoniae; AD-36 was not included in this panel) (Fernandez-Real, 2006) .",

However, responses to viral infections depend on many factors of host defense, including food intake and exercise (Chapter 3). Resolution of cause and effect in these associations is difficult because obesity and diabetes increase vulnerability to infections (Falagas and Kompoti, 2006) (Chapter 3). Nonetheless, these recent findings support the suggestion of (Lyons et al, 1982 ) that viral infections have roles in sporadic childhood and adult obesity. AD-36 infections that lead to obesity by causing hypothalamic lesions could be another, and milder example, of viruses that propagate by modifying behaviors, although how obesity could particularly favor AD-36 viral propagation is far from obvious.",

Causality is elusive because these infections are ubiquitous. Herpes virus infections occur widely. Postmortem, about 2/3 of all brains, normal and Alzheimer, have HSV-1 (Itzhaki, 1997). HSV-1 infections reside in some brain regions affected by AD (frontal lobe and hippocampus), as well as the trigeminal ganglion. At later ages, HSV-1 infections appear to be active by the presence of HSV-1 antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of about half AD and normal controls (Wozniak et al, 2005) . Clearly, AD can arise in the absence of active HSV-1 infections! However, in one sample, the apoE4 allele and HSV-1 co-occurred 10-fold more frequently in AD brains than normal elderly (PCR assay). ApoE4 carriers may have a greater risk of neurodegeneration from the activation of HSV-1 (Itzhaki et al, 1997). HSV-1 activation in the trigeminal ganglion causes shingles, which afflicts many elderly. A much rarer condition is herpes simplex encephalitis; survivors often have life-long cognitive impairments, possibly from neuronal apoptosis from HSV-1 (Aurelian, 2005). Other candidates are human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) seropositivity in Alzheimer (22% AD vs. 0% controls) (Wozniak et al, 2005) and CMV in vascular dementia (93% VascD vs. 34% controls) (Lin et al, 2001) .",

The formation of fibrillar A\u03b2 is puzzling because the mouse A\u03b21-42 protein differs from the human in three substitutions that reduce aggregation (Section 1.6.). Nonetheless, mice overexpressing TGF-\u03b21 (an inflammatory factor upregulated in Alzheimer brains) slowly developed fibrillar A\u03b2 deposits around cortical microvessels; these deposits were preceded by thickening of the basement membrane.

The effects of aging on responses to LPS were not examined by these transgenic studies, which used relatively young mice. In stroke models, LPS pretreatment increases subsequent brain damage from cerebral artery blockade (Becker et al, 2005) . Moreover, blood CRP is also elevated by LPS (Section 1.2) and elevated peripheral CRP increased damage from stroke in rats (Gill et al, 2004) . Thus, in populations with high levels of infection and inflammation, stroke may cause greater brain damage and higher mortality. It is unclear if systemic endotoxins cross the blood-brain barrier. In rodents, systemic LPS binds to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Section 1.2 and Section 2.2.2 above) on cerebrovascular endothelia, which may increase vascular permeability to some sugars (Singh and Jiana, 2004) .",

The average age at death was 43 years, which is two decades before amyloid deposits become generally common. Nearly 50% of 150 brains from AIDS victims had diffuse A\u03b2 deposits in the frontal cortex, most frequently near arteries (Green et al, 2005) . Neuronal A\u03b2 was also common, an early change in Alzheimer disease (Section 1.6.3). So far, AIDS brains have not shown two hallmarks of Alzheimer disease: compact neuritic plaques (Rempel and Pulliam, 2005) or neurofibrillary tangles (Green et al, 2005) . These findings with well-characterized monoclonal antibodies confirm smaller studies of AIDS brains, which also included younger ages (Esiri et al, 1998; Izycka-Swieszewska et al, 2000; Rempel and Pulliam, 2005) . Two mechanisms are noteworthy because of possible synergy: (I) induction of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neurons as an acute phase response during the brain inflammation of AIDS (Section 1.6.4) and (II) decreased degradation of A\u03b2 by neprolysin, an endopeptidase enzymatically inhibited by Tat peptides from the HIV-encoded protein (Daily et al, 2006; Rempel and Pulliam, 2005) . Both mechanisms should increase the production of oligomeric and solid A\u03b2. More information may be anticipated from HIV carriers who did not develop AIDS because of successful anti-viral therapy. ",

TTR amyloidosis was increased by exposure to enterobacteria and yeast, and decreased by anaerobic cocci.

The MacArthur Study of Successful Aging followed high performing elderly for 7 years in a carefully controlled analysis (Weaver et al, 2002) . Elderly in the highest IL-6 tertile had twice the risk of cognitive decline (Fig. 2.10A ). This subgroup may be < 25% of all elderly with elevated IL-6. Other studies show similar risks. In the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study of well-functioning elderly (African American and Caucasian) (Yaffe et al, 2003) , during 2 years, the top tertile of inflammatory markers showed a risk of cognitive declines in association with levels of CRP (OR 1.41) and IL-6 (OR, 1.34), but not for TNF\u03b1. During 5 years of observation, 23% had significant cognitive decline. Subgroups with both the metabolic syndrome (Chapter 1) and high inflammatory markers had 1.66-fold higher risk of cognitive impairment (Yaffe et al, 2004) . In the Helsinki Aging Study over 5 years, the risk of cognitive decline increased with CRP > 5 mg/L (OR, 2.32) and diabetes (OR 2.18) (Tilvis et al, 2004). However, the Longitudinal Aging Study (Amsterdam) found mixed associations: Cognitive decline was associated with elevated \u03b1 1 -antichymotrypsin (ACT), but not with elevations of CRP or IL-6 (Dik et al, 2005) . In the Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS) for those over 50 during 6 years, elevated CRP was associated with decline in only one cognitive test (word learning) (Teunissen et al, 2003) . The InCHIANTI study of aging in Tuscan communities documents the age-related increase of IL-6 and other acute phase proteins (Cesari et al, 2004) ( Fig. 1.21) and may soon report on cognition. Overall, the associations of acute phase elevations and cognitive declines are modest and may not generalize between populations. Some divergences may be due to different tests used.

Although these studies of normal aging excluded individuals with signs of dementia at entry, none was designed to identify the early, preclinical stages (CDR 0.5 or mild cognitive impairment) (Section 1.6.3). However, the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study of men clearly shows associations of blood CRP at middle age with Alzheimer and vascular dementia 25 years later (Schmidt et al, 2002) . Relative to the lowest quartile, the top three quartiles showed 3-fold higher risk of Alzheimer and vascular dementias 25 years later (Fig. 2.10B ). The risks did not scale smoothly with CRP levels, but are highly significant for each of the top three quartiles: for Alzheimer, for vascular dementia, and for mixed cases. These associations were independent of cardiovascular disease in this sample, which may represent selective mortality. However, InCHIANTI attributed most of the elevations of CRP and other acute phase proteins to cardiovascular disease (Cesari et al, 2004) . Seropositivity to C. pneumoniae was prevalent among the elderly and correlated with IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 (Blanc et al, 2004) . As noted in Section 1.5.4, vascular and Alzheimer disease share many risk factors including elevated acute phase proteins, elevated cholesterol, and hypertension. ",

During the life span, humans and other mammals show major shifts from naive T cells to memory T cells with progressively restricted repertoire (oligoclonality) (Sections 1.2.2 and 1.4.3). This aspect of immunosenescence can be accelerated by greater exposure to antigens. The 'hyperstimulation hypothesis' of naive T cell depletion is most strongly developed for the very common infections by cytomegalovirus (CMV). Deficits of memory cells and the presence of highly differentiated T cells with CMV-specificity are strongly linked to CMV seropositivity. These changes characterize an 'immune risk phenotype' with higher mortality in the elderly, observed in two European populations (Akbar and Fletcher, 2005; Huppert et al, 2003; Pawelec et al, 2005; Wikby et al, 2005) . Continued antigenic stimulation is hypothesized to drive clonal expansions of memory T cells and is predicted to eventually clonally deplete cells with the highest antigenic affinity. Moreover, the hyperstimulation by one antigen can have bystander effects that activate other T cell specificities due to local secretion of IFN\u03b1 and TNF\u03b1 (Fletcher et al, 2005) (Section 1.4.3) .",

In Ethiopians infected with HIV and nematodes, the plasma HIV load was correlated with the helminth load; successful de-worming treatment also decreased HIV viremia in 8/11 patients (Wolday et al, 2002) . Ethiopian immigrants to Israel have given unique opportunities to study the reversibility of age-like immunological changes after leaving a highly infectious environment (van Baarle et al, 2005) . About 60,000 Ethiopians of all ages arrived in two waves, 1984-1985 and 1991 . Immigrants were often infected with worms, but not with HIV, malaria, or TB. The immigrants were characterized by abnormally low proportions of naive CD4 + T cells and excess T memory cells ('broad T cell activation') (Borkow et al, 2000; Kalinkovich et al, 1998; Kalinkovich et al, 2001) . Nearly half had inverted CD4:CD8 ratios <1, not found in control groups that resemble the 'immune risk phenotype' of elderly northern Europeans (Section 1.2). T cell impairments included decreased activation of ERK2 kinases, \u03b2-chemokine secretion, and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH, memory T cell dependent). Effective de-worming restored the DTH (Borkow et al, 2000) , normalized the ratios of CD4:CD8 T cells, and almost normalized the T cell activation profile (Kalinkovich et al, 1998) . Evidently, elimination of the nematode antigen load partly regenerated a naive T cell pool, as occurs in HIV infections. Even when not infected with HIV or worms, by the age of 5, Ethiopians have abnormally high proportions of memory T cells, indicative of antigenic hyperstimulation (Tsegaye et al, 2003) . Nonetheless, their neonatal T cell proportions were normal, suggesting effective placental barriers to maternal infections (see Section 4.6.4). Their short life expectancy (about 40 y, like other pre-industrial populations, Fig. 1.1 legend) and high memory T cell profile suggest that some Ethiopians are exposed to conditions prevailing in 18 th century Europe where life span was also about 40 y (Section 2.4). These continuing studies promise unique insights on the rate of reversibility of immunosenescence after the transition to a 21 st century environment with greatly improved health care, hygiene, and nutrition.",

Moreover, normal intestinal flora also influence memory T cell clonal expansions, as shown with germ-free mice (Kieper et al, 2005) . We may conclude that the individual profile of aging in instructive immunity is closely linked to the cumulative antigenic experience that certainly begins at birth with the first full encounter to the germy world and may well begin earlier in the undocumented levels of prenatal infections. Internal sources of antigens also extend far beyond enteric and oral fauna to auto-antigens, possibly including AGEs accumulated on long-lived proteins. Lastly, the trends for increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines may also influence adaptive immunity, because IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, etc., modulate many aspects of immune progenitor cell differentiation, including stem cells.",

Neurogenesis was inversely correlated with the density of local microglia. Neurogenesis was restored by minocycline, an antibiotic that passes the bloodbrain barrier and suppresses microglial reactions in neurodegenerative disease models.

(II) The cytokine shift to increased IFN\u03b3 production by differentiated T cells may interact with the proinflammatory trend during aging.

About 15% of all cancers are attributed to infections, directly or indirectly (Herrera et al, 2005) . Links between aging, cancer, and endogenous inflammation are also hypothesized (Sarkar and Fisher, 2005) . Many cancers and abnormal growths are associated with local inflammatory cell responses that stimulate cell proliferation. In the mutational theory of oncogenesis, the mutagenic progression to malignancy begins with DNA damage. Mutations accumulate during DNA replication, which may be stimulated endogenously, e.g., by sex steroids in reproductive tissues or exogenously, e.g., ultraviolet damage, carcinogens, viruses. Inflammatory processes after initiation are illustrated by the ras pathway. Ras protooncogenes (H-ras, K-ras, N-ras) are often activated by mutations; e.g., 50% of colon cancers have mutations in ras (Bos, 1989) . Activated ras protein, in turn, induces IL-1 and IL-8 and other proinflammatory cytokines (Sparmann and Bar-Sagi, 2004; Liu et al, 2004) . IL-8 induction involves ERK-MAPK and PI3K pathways, which also influence longevity ( Fig. 1.3) . IL-8 mediates the recruitment of macrophages and other inflammatory cells that promote tumor vascularization (angiogenesis). Local inflammatory responses may also produce ROS that induce further mutations on the pathway to malignancy. Several examples are discussed in more detail that represent inflammation from infections (next) and from smoking (following section) and that further illustrate the importance of bystander damage during inflammation (Chapter 1.4).",

These links are much stronger than associations of H. pylori with vascular disease (Section 2.2). Most humans have submucosal infections of H. pylori: 76% in developing countries, 58% in developed countries (Parkin et al, 2005) . Infections are usually acquired early in life, and the risk is several-fold higher if parents are infected (Webb et al, 1994; Rothenbacher et al, 2002) . Fortunately, most carriers (85%) are asymptomatic. However, about 15% of carriers develop peptic ulcers, with 1% proceeding to gastro-intestinal cancers. As hygiene and public health improve, the prevalence of infections decreases. In successive birth cohorts of the Bristol Helicobacter project, cancer incidence has decreased correspondingly with H. pylori infections (Harvey et al, 2002; Lane et al, 2002) . This progression supports the general relationships of the early-life infectious load to later mortality in successive cohorts (Fig. 2.8 ) and is a benchmark example of by-stander effects in infections (Queries 1 and 2, Section 1.1).",

For example, cancer risk was 10-fold higher by the combined presence of a high-risk H. pylori virulence factor and high-risk IL-1 allele than in the opposite low-risk combination (Figueiredo et al, 2002) . Anti-inflammatory NSAIDs, which inhibit COX-2, are protective in H. pylori infections (more on this in the next section).

Oxidant stress from inflammation is a leading mechanism in colorectal cancer.

Each infection increases the risk about 20-fold, while co-infection may increase the risk >100-fold (Donato et al, 1998) . A substantial minority (5-20%) of HBV infections progresses from cirrhosis, within 5 y of diagnosis, to hepatocellular carcinoma (Imperial, 1999; Marcellin et al, 2005) . HBV-induced cancer is associated with increased inflammatory expression: Although the acute phase responses during HBV were not reported in detail, IL-6 elevation correlates with the clinical severity (Tangkijvanich et al, 2000) . Tumorigenesis depends on Hepatitis-Bx (HBx), a virally encoded signaling peptide that stimulates hepatocyte proliferation by activating NF-\u03baB after viral integration. Hbx also facilitates metastasis by inducing matrix remodeling through matrix metalloproteinases and COX-2 (Lara-Pezzi et al, 2002) . These latter inflammatory responses are all-too-familiar in atheromas (Section 1.5.3.1). COX-2 inhibitors suppress cell invasion in experimental models (Lara-Pezzi et al, 2002) , but their efficacy has not been reported for HBV or HBC. These examples of H. pylori and hepatitis virus in inflammation and cancer merely scratch the surface of a growing literature that links chronic inflammation to cancer and that shows promise for anti-inflammatory drugs (see below).",

These cross-over effects are consistent with shared anti-inflammatory effects of diverse drugs in heart disease and with evidence for the pervasiveness of inflammatory processes in \"normal\" aging and in Alzheimer and vascular disease.

Meta-analyses agree in the shared efficacy of quite different drugs in reducing the risk of vascular events, certain cancers, and possibly Alzheimer disease, with effects in the broad range of 10-60% (Table 2. 2). No single study can suffice, and there are many divergences between indications of efficacy from animal models and clinical effects. It is hard to interpret the drug literature on vascular disease and dementia (Baron, 2003) : Clinical end-points differ between studies, as do drug doses and durations. There is great heterogeneity in age, health status, ethnicity, socioeconomics, and education. Those taking aspirin and other drugs often modify their lifestyles, which reduces their risks independently of the drug candidate. Thus, the 'possible benefits' of the drugs in Table 2 .2 should be considered a moving target of continuing critical evaluation for complex drug interactions to identify subgroups by risk and benefit for remaining life expectancy. The pharmacology of anti-inflammatory drugs distinguishes two broad groups: steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAIDs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Hardman and Limbird, 2001; Vane and Botting, 2003) . NSAIDs alter production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, 'isoprenoids' that have diverse and broad roles in normal physiology and in disease, e.g. the thromboxane TXA 2 enhances local platelet aggregation, while blockers of TXA 2 can be protective against thrombosis. The ubiquitous isoprenoids are also referred to as 'autocoids' because they are produced from local membrane lipids. Arachidonic acid is an autocoid substrate of the cyclooxygenase enzymes, COX-1, -2, and -3. COX-1 products mediate normal functions of gastric mucosa and kidney, as well as coagulation: COX-2 is induced during inflammatory reactions, e.g., by LPS and other endotoxins. COX-1 and COX-2 are coded by distinct genes, whereas COX-3 is a new splicing variant of COX-1 with overlapping functions (Botting, 2003; Vane et al, 2003) . PI3-K, of the 'insulin/IGF-1 metabolic longevity' pathways ( Fig. 1.3) , mediates many NSAIDs' actions. For example, PI3-K is required for induction of COX-2 by endotoxin (LPS) in mesangial cells (Sheu et al, 2005) .",

Aspirin has anti-coagulant activities that reduce the risk of vascular events. At 160 mg/d, aspirin doubles the clotting time by irreversibly inhibiting platelet COX-1, which makes TXA 2 from arachidonic acid, an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Aspirin effects on clotting last up to 10 days, the life span (t1 \u2044 2 ) of blood platelets. Higher doses of aspirin are used for rheumatic inflammatory diseases, but often cause gastric bleeding due to blockade of COX-1 in the gastric mucosa. However, even after its acetylation by aspirin, COX-2 activity persists for certain PUFA \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 substrates, some of which are anti-inflammatory, e.g., 15 epi-lipoxin A 4 (Arita et al, 2005) . Ibuprofen and naproxen are non-selective for COX-1 and-2 (Cryer and Feldman, 1998) . Other NSAIDs were developed to target COX-2 without inhibiting COX-1, effectively reducing inflammatory responses with fewer gastric side effects, e.g., celecoxib, naproxen, and rofecoxib. COX-2 and prostaglandin production are also inhibited by synthetic glucocorticoids, as noted above.",

For example, a population-based case-control study in Finland showed that NSAIDs users had 40% higher risk of a myocardial infarct (OR, 1.40, 95% CI, 1.33-1.48) (Helin-Salmivaara et al, 2006) . The various types of COX-2 inhibitors had similar effects. An underlying mechanism may be that inhibiting COX-2 may induce both proinflammatory and prothrombotic homeostatic compensatory responses (Doux et al, 2005) . Homeostatic responses would be expected because of the importance of COX-2 to many normal cellular functions, e.g., celecoxib induced COX-2 in rat spinal cord (Hsueh et al, 2004) . Moreover, due to their short half-lives in circulation (e.g., t1 \u2044 2 11 h, celecoxob), there could be prothrombotic transients in prostaglandin conversion in the declining phase before another dose is taken. Withdrawal from chronic aspirin in stable cardiac patients, for example, may increase the incidence of thromboses (Senior, 2003) . These early observations merit full study.",

            "text": "Statin drugs were designed to lower blood cholesterol by blocking a ratelimiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis (HGM-CoA reductase). In addition, statins have many effects on inflammation (Balk et al, 2003; Halcox and Deanfield, 2004l; Kwak et al, 2003; Schonbeck and Libby, 2004; Stuve et al, 2003) , which may account for vascular benefits not directly linked to blood lipids. Cholesterolindependent pleiotropic effects of statins include the lowering of blood CRP (Albert et al, 2001) , inflammatory cell infiltration and cell death (Wierzbicki et al, 2003) , and impairing of lymphocyte proliferation (Palinski and Tsimikas, 2002b) . Some statin effects result directly from the decrease of mevalonate from the inhibition of HMG CoA reductase. Intracellular mevalonate is a precursor to the isoprenoids (farnesyl pyrophosphate, geranylgeranyl) that modulate enzymes with links to inflammation and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, e.g., the Ras and Rho kinases (Endres and Laufs, 2006; Kamiyama et al, 2003) . PI3K/Akt is also involved in the induction of nitric oxide synthase by statins (Walter et al, 2004) . Statins also increase circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (Urbich and Dimmeler, 2005; Vasa et al, 2001a,b) , which are implicated in vascular repair (Sections 1.5.3.4 and 2.5.2) and may modulate EPC cell senescence by suppressing Chk2, a DNA damage checkpoint kinase induced by telomere dysfunction (Spyridopoulos et al, 2004) . Cardioprotective effects of NSAIDs and statins involve neovascularization (Vagnucci and Li, 2003) , which may be important to both AD neuritic plaques and in vascular atheromas (Chapter 1, Table 1 .3).",

As discussed above, gastric cancer is strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori infections, which elevate mucosal prostaglandins (Laine et al, 1995) . In one mechanism, aspirin directly inhibits H. pylori growth (Wang et al, 2003c) . Breast cancer may also benefit by aspirin and NSAIDs (Zhang et al, 2005) , particularly for cancers that have both estrogen and progesterone receptors (Terry et al, 2004) . The optimum dose of aspirin for cancer prevention may be higher than for coronary disease (Chan et al, 2004) .

Contrary to assumptions, these activities do not require COX-1 inhibition and appear to modify amyloid production through direct allosteric effects on \u03b3-secretase, the enzyme complex that cleaves A\u03b242 from the amyloid-precursor protein. As noted above, COX-2 drugs are associated with increased risk of myocardial infarctions. Possibly, their withdrawal from general long-term use may also benefit the risk of dementia on two grounds: the shared prothrombotic risk factor of myocardial and cerebrovascular events and the increased production of A\u03b242 by these drugs.",

In a meta-analysis, statins reduced the risk of coronary events by about 60% and stroke by 17%, in association with lower LDL cholesterol (Law et al, 2003) . Among secondary prevention medications for cardiovascular disease, statins reduced cardiac mortality by 24% to 42%, i.e., at least as much as aspirin and blood pressure medications (\u03b2-adrenergic blockers, and ACE inhibitors) (Fonarow and Watson, 2003; Grobbee and Bots, 2003) . Statins also lowered cardiovascular mortality in patients with normal cholesterol in two major studies: the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study ('4S') and the Long-Term Intervention with Prevastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) trial (Fonarow and Watson, 2003) . Statins influence vascular plaque size by mechanisms that may be independent of effects of statins on blood cholesterol levels (Wierzbicki et al, 2003) . The FATS trial showed 75% decrease of cardiovascular events, despite the small improvement in stenosis (<1%) (Brown et al, 1993) . These authors suggested that statins selectively depleted unstable fatty plaques with large lipid cores ( Fig. 1.13 , type IV), thereby stabilizing the lesions and reducing thrombosis. Plaque shrinkage during statin use is documented by sonography (Sato et al, 2003) and magnetic imaging (Vigen et al, 2005) .",

However, the lower levels of isoprenoids had opposing effects by increasing production of APP and A\u03b242, which would be pro-amyloidogenic. This may be why lovastatin increased brain amyloid in a transgenic Alzheimer mouse (Tg2676), despite lower plasma cholesterol (Park et al, 2003) . Rebound effects are also observed in discontinuation of statins, which are associated with increased risk of stroke and mortality (Endres and Laufs, 2006) . Statin clearance after sustained administration suddenly activates rho and Rac-1, leading to oxidative bursts and decreased NO availability.

Sex differences in mortality are present throughout life with greater overall male vulnerability (Section 5.2): In developed countries during recent decades, age-specific death rates of adult women lag behind those of men and approximate those of adult men who are 5 y or more younger (Fig. 5 .2). After middle age, cardiovascular disease becomes the first or second main cause of death in most populations (Section 1.2.2, Fig. 1.4) . Mortality rate accelerations tend to be slightly faster for women than men, for both total and cardiovascular mortality (Horiuchi, 1997), but within the population average mortality rate doubling times of about 7-10 y (Section 1.2.1). The mortality accelerations are concurrent with menopause, which implies a role for the sharp decrease of ovarian steroid levels. However, behavioral and environmental risk factors vary widely between populations, making it is hard to resolve the contributions of age-changes in sex hormones to health and mortality after middle age.",

Transdermal estradiol differs from CEE in effect on inflammatory markers (see footnote 6). Equine estrogens (Premarin, from pregnant mare's urine; Wyeth-Ayerst) have been widely used since 1942, because of their availability from an abundant natural source that preceded industrial estrogen synthesis. The equine estrogens in Premarin include equilin and other compounds not made by human ovaries whose estrogenic activities are not well defined (Bhavnani, 1998; Dey et al, 2000; Rozovsky et al, 2002a) . Estradiol is a minority component of Premarin and varies widely between preparations over a 3-fold range, 4.5-12% (Bhavnani, 1998).",

This potentially important effect arises because the portal circulation carries, on the first circulatory pass, the estrogens absorbed from the gut directly to the liver, which is the source of most systemic CRP . Transdermal estrogens, however, are diluted by the venous circulation before reaching the liver. Fortunately, IL-6, fibrinogen, and other inflammatory risk factors in cardiovascular disease are not induced by oral estrogens. In a case control study of 492 older women within the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, the cardiovascular risk in the top quartile of CRP was independent of estrogen usage (Tice et al, 2003 ).",

The timing of replacement may be particularly important (Clarkson, 2002) . In WHI and several other trials, estrogen therapy was initiated at 10 or more years after menopause (age at entry averaged 63 y). This delay is important because early menopause accelerates 'subclinical' atherosclerosis, as does surgical ovariectomy (Stampfer et al, 1990) . The duration of estrogen deficits also influences carotid artery thickness in correlation with the time since menopause (surgical and natural) (Mack et al, 2004) : thickness increased by 0.0032 mm/y after menopause (age-adjusted), which is about 50% of the overall age trend of 0.006 mm/y (author's calculation). 7 In monkeys, estrogen replacement was most effective in suppressing arterial plaque growth if begun at ovariectomy; estrogen replacement was ineffective if delayed 2 y (equivalent human age 52) (Clarkson, 2002) .",

Dietary PUFA regulation of coagulation is attributed to the partial replacement of arachidonic acid (\u03c9-6) by eicosapentanoic acid (\u03c9-3) in platelet membranes, which lowers production of TXA2; e.g., 3 wk of increased fish consumption lowered TXA 2 (Mann et al, 1997) .

The same transgenic Alzheimer mice that responded to NSAIDs (see above) also show strong effects of dietary PUFAs (Calon et al, 2004; Calon et al, 2005) . Depletion of docosahexanoic acid (\u03c9-3) by an \u03c9-6 rich diet (safflower oil) caused huge deficits (>90%) in glutamatergic synapses (NR2A & -B) and in the PI3K subunit, p85\u03b1.

Drugs with antiinflammatory actions appear to show corresponding benefits. These strong bidirectional effects are consistent with the major role of inflammation in the progression of vascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. Query III (Section 1.1) is well answered with major evidence for inflammation in bystander damage in aging from infections and inflammogens in aerosols and diet. The acceleration of telomere shortening by inflammation may prove to be a major mechanism in immune dysfunctions during aging (bystander type III damage, Section 1.4.3). The molecular mechanisms may include PI3K/Akt signaling, which is on the insulin signaling pathway of many mutations that increase life span of laboratory animals ( Fig. 1.3A and Chapter 5). New drugs that selectively target PI3K isoforms for cancer (Kang et al, 2005; Osaki et al, 2004) and vascular disease (Walter et al, 2004 ) may have broader influences on longevity. Chapter 3 considers evidence that lower caloric intake and moderate physical activity can attenuate many of these chronic diseases and aging processes, in approximate parallel with the beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory drugs. The evolution of human longevity (Chapter 6) will further consider how humans became increasingly exposed to inflammation and the role of diet-aging-disease interactions.",
