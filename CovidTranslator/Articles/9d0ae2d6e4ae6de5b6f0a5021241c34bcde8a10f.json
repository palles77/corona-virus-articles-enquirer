Mammals, birds, reptiles, and probably amphibians are reservoirs or amplifying hosts for viral zoonoses. Frequently, these viruses cause little or no overt disease in their nonhuman vertebrate hosts. Some zoonotic viruses have very limited host ranges; others may infect a wide range of vertebrates. Human infection may vary from unapparent to fatal disease. Both new and old viral zoonoses are especially important in emerging and reemerging virus diseases. Transmission of zoonotic viruses may occur by a variety of routes. They include: \"direct\" (e.g., rabies virus) or \"indirect\" (e.g., hantavirus) contact; \"nosocomial\" (e.g., Ebola virus); \"aerosol transmission\" (SARS coronavirus); \"vertical\" (in utero) (Zika virus); and \"vectoror arthropod-borne\" (e.g., yellow fever virus and West Nile virus). Viral zoonotic diseases occur on every continent except, perhaps Antarctica. Some are found around the world, in a variety of ecological settings. Others are found only in very limited ecologic and geographic foci. Although hundreds of viruses are zoonotic, the importance of many of these viruses has not yet been established. Some of the more important viral zoonoses will be discussed briefly.",

Influenza A viruses are widely distributed in nature and infect humans along with a wide variety of birds, especially waterfowl, and mammals. Virus subtypes are classified on the basis of the antigenicity of their surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). To date, 18 HA and 11 NA genes are known to exist. Of these genes, only three HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two NA (N1 and N2) subtypes have circulated in the human population in the current and last century. The most catastrophic impact of influenza was the pandemic of 1918, also known as the Spanish flu (H1N1), which resulted in the loss of >500,000 lives in the United States and caused about 40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza B circulates among humans and is not considered zoonotic, although recent data suggests it can occur in seals. Influenza C occurs in humans and pigs, but is a very mild illness and is rarely reported. Influenza D occurs in cattle and has not been reported as a human pathogen.",

            "text": "The ability of influenza viruses to undergo antigenic changes is the cause of ongoing significant public health concern. New subtypes emerge when human virus captures genes from animal influenza viruses via reassortment; an event that can occur when both virus types simultaneously infect a host (antigenic shift). Although human strains of influenza A virus replicate poorly in waterfowl, and avian strains generally replicate poorly in human, both replicate well in pigs, making them the ideal \"mixing vessel\" for emergence of new strains of virus. The threat imposed by influenza virus has been further elevated with the recent introductions of avian influenza viruses into the human population. Avian influenza viruses were initially considered nonpathogenic for humans. However, this perception has changed since 1997, when 18 Hong Kong residents were infected by an avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype that resulted in six deaths. Over the next few years, several other cases of direct avian-to-human transmission were reported, including the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses in several Asian, African, and European countries. More recently, H7N9 strains of avian influenza have emerged and been associated with infections in humans having close contact with commercial poultry. Migratory waterfowl-most notably wild ducks-are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses, and these birds are also the most resistant to symptomatic infection. Domestic poultry, including chickens and turkeys, are particularly susceptible to epidemics of rapidly fatal influenza. Direct or indirect contact of domestic flocks with wild migratory waterfowl has been implicated as a frequent cause of epidemics. Live bird markets have also played an important role in the spread of epidemics. Viruses of low pathogenicity can, after circulation for sometimes short periods in a poultry population, mutate into highly pathogenic viruses. Quarantine of infected farms and destruction of infected or potentially exposed flocks are standard control measures aimed at preventing spread to other farms and eventual establishment of the virus in a country's poultry population.",

In the Americas, hantavirus can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), an infectious disease typically characterized by fever, myalgia, and headache and followed by dyspnea, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension, and shock. HPS has also been reported and confirmed in seven countries in South America: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Panama (Table 2) . A more severe clinical syndrome, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), shares many of the clinical symptoms of HPS but includes acute renal failure in the final stages. Hantaviruses are harbored by wild rodents which often live in close association with humans. Virus is shed in urine and other excreta. Outbreaks of HPS have been associated with ecological changes and invasion of human habitations by expanding wild rodent populations. More recently, outbreaks of HFRS have been associated with infections in commercial rat colonies. When hantavirus infections were first recognized diagnosis was complicated by the lack of efficient and sensitive isolation and serological methods. However, recent advances in molecular diagnostics has made clinical diagnosis much more efficient and practical. Rodent control and avoidance of exposure to rodent excreta, especially in dust, are the only methods available currently for prevention of transmission to humans.",

There are about 22 different arenaviruses in the Americas, but only four are associated with significant human disease. These pathogenic arenaviruses establish persistent infection in their rodent hosts, and the virus is shed in urine, infecting humans who live in close contact with these contaminated environments. LCMV has been documented to occur as a result of organ transplantation. Lassa fever is also transmitted nosocomially in rural hospitals to other people in contact with blood from viremic patients. Control of these diseases is attempted mainly by reduction of rodent populations. A live, attenuated vaccine has been developed for Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and a vaccinia-vectored vaccine has been developed for Lassa fever. Ribavirin is effective for treating arenavirus infection if given early in the course of infection and convalescent immune plasma has been administered with some success. ",

The virus exists predominately in a jungle (sylvan) cycle between nonhuman primates and mosquitoes. Humans or primates can transport the virus from densely forested regions to grassland (savanna) environments or urban areas, where a variety of mosquito vectors can transmit YF to humans. YF remains a disease of significant public health importance, with an estimated 200,000 cases and 30,000 deaths annually. The disease is endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America; nearly 90% of YF cases and deaths occur in Africa. It is a significant hazard to unvaccinated travelers to these endemic areas. Reestablishment of the major urban vector, Aedes aegypti, the recent spread of the Asian tiger mosquito (Ae. albopictus) as well as the rise in air travel has increased the risk of introduction and spread of the disease. YF is an acute infectious disease characterized by sudden onset with a two-phase development, separated by a short period of remission. The clinical spectrum of YF varies from very mild, nonspecific, febrile illness to a fulminating, sometimes fatal disease with pathognomonic features. In severe cases, jaundice, bleeding diathesis, with hepatorenal involvement is common. There is no specific treatment for YF, making the management of YF patients extremely problematic. YF can be diagnosed by virus isolation, detection of circulating antigens, demonstration of a significant rise in specific YF virus antibodies, and microscopic detection of viral inclusion bodies or antigen in tissues taken at postmortem examination. Insecticide spraying and elimination of breeding sites in homes can be used for vector control in epidemic situations. Disease can be prevented in humans by vaccination.",

The virus was first discovered in the West Nile District of Uganda in the 1937. Since then it has been found to be widespread throughout parts of Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia, and has been associated with numerous outbreaks among humans and horses. WNV first appeared in North America in 1999 with an outbreak in New York City producing high mortality in crows and other birds. Based on serologic surveys, most human infections are asymptomatic. However, around 20% of infected individuals experience a febrile illness characterized by malaise, myalgia and lymphadenopathy. <1% of patients show severe neurologic involvement manifested by focal paralysis, encephalitis, coma and death. Severe neurological involvement is most common in young children and the elderly. After 1999 the virus spread rapidly throughout North America, the Caribbean, Mexico, and into South America. WNV is now present in every state except Hawaii, and Alaska. Numerous bird and mosquito species have been are susceptible to infection with WNV but vary dramatically in their competence as reservoir hosts and vectors. Culex spp. mosquitoes seem especially important as vectors. There is no vaccine or antiviral therapy currently approved for humans.",

Since then there has been significant spread of infection throughout Central and South America and into the southern United States. Infection in humans is through Aedes spp. mosquitoes, mostly A. aegypti and A. albopictus. Sexual transmission can also occur and recent studies indicate that men infected with Zika virus can have viable virus present in their semen for up to 6 months or more. One of the most important complications of Zika virus infection is vertical transmission from mothers to infants either in utero or during delivery. Although most infections are subclinical, when symptoms do occur they mimic a mild form of dengue with fever, arthralgias, conjunctivitis and maculopapular rash. In infants the consequences are much more severe with many of them developing microcephaly and other severe brain malformations. There is no specific antiviral therapy for Zika virus. Prevention is based largely on avoidance of mosquito vectors in endemic areas and reducing sexual transmission to women of child bearing age from men recovering from acute infection.

Transmission can also occur from contact with infected animal blood and nosocomially through infected human blood and body fluids.

The epizootic/epidemic (VEE, IAB, and IC) virus variants are of greatest concern. In equines (horses, donkeys, and mules), the virus causes acute encephalitis, and case fatality may approach 80%. Survivors may have serious neurological deficits. Although the case-fatality rate in humans is low (<1%), the large numbers of acutely infected people that occur during an epidemic may completely overwhelm the local healthcare system. VEE, IAB, and IC viruses are maintained in northern South America, where they have periodically swept through Venezuela and Colombia in epidemic waves, with occasional extensions into Ecuador and massively through Central America into Mexico and South Texas. Epidemic spread depends on the availability of susceptible equine populations (the amplifying host) and abundant mosquito vectors of several species. The interepidemic maintenance systems remain undefined but is probably through infected birds, rodents and other mammals in forests and marshlands. There is evidence that the epizootic strains may arise by mutation of subtype ID enzootic virus. The enzootic strains are maintained in limited foci involving rodents and Culex (Melanconion) spp. mosquitoes from Florida to Argentina. With the exception of subtype IE, which has caused epizootics in horses in Mexico, these enzootic virus strains do not cause disease in equine animals, but can cause acute febrile illness in humans. The VEE complex viruses are in the genus Alphavirus of the Togaviridae. There is an effective live, attenuated vaccine for both human and equine use. Because the maintenance of equine herd immunity is costly, most animal health agencies do not carry out ongoing, intensive vaccination campaigns. Thus, the risk of reoccurrence of explosive outbreaks remains. Eastern (EEE) and western (WEE) equine encephalitis viruses occur in epidemic form in North America, but have also been found in Central and South America. Generally, EEE is maintained in eastern North America but has caused scattered epizootics and cases in the Caribbean, and in Central and South America. Both viruses are maintained in nature through bird-mosquito-bird cycles of infection but can infect humans and horses sporadically and during epidemics. The most important vector for EEE is Culiseta melanura, a mosquito that inhabits marshlands and is not prone for biting humans. For WEE the most common vector is Culex tarsalis, a common mosquito species in the western United States and one that frequently bites humans. EEE virus can be divided into a North American-Caribbean clade, an Amazon Basin clade, and a Trinidad, Venezuela, Guyana, Ecuador, and Argentina clade. In North America, WEE occurs in western and prairie states and provinces and along the west coast. WEE has caused sporadic cases of encephalitis in equine animals, but not humans, in Argentina and Uruguay. Both involve wild birds and mosquito vectors, with spillover into equine population and humans, causing clinical encephalitis and death. Central nervous sequelae may occur among survivors. Effective vaccines are available commercially for equine animals, and experimental vaccines are used for laboratory personnel. Effective mosquito abatement to control vector populations has been carried out in the West for many years. Insecticide application is used for vector control in epidemic situations.",

A major outbreak in East Africa began in 2006 in northeastern Kenya, and spread into southern Somalia and Tanzania. Cattle, sheep, and humans are affected. Abortion storms with febrile disease and bloody diarrhea occur in ruminant animals, and mortality may be heavy in young stock. Most infected humans develop febrile disease, with prolonged convalescence. A few individuals develop more severe disease, with liver necrosis, hemorrhagic pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, and retinitis with vision loss. The human case-fatality rate is <1%. RVF virus is in the genus Phlebovirus of the Bunyaviridae. In sub-Saharan Africa, RVF virus is closely tied to its Aedes mosquito vectors. RVF vectors transmit the virus transovarially and horizontally. The virus persists in mosquito eggs laid around seasonally flooded pools and depressions. When these pools flood, the eggs hatch and infected mosquitoes emerge and begin transmission. The vertebrate reservoir hosts of RVF virus are unknown. Field and laboratory workers need to exercise caution to avoid becoming infected by exposure to the virus during postmortem examination of animals or processing materials in the laboratory. Both live, attenuated and inactivated vaccines are available for animals, but the unpredictability of scattered, sporadic RVF outbreaks across sub-Saharan Africa has been a major obstacle for triggering implementation of extensive, cost-effective vaccination programs.

However, there have been some notable exceptions. Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, caused by Machupo virus, was controlled by reduction of its rodent hosts through intensive rodenticiding. The principal vampire bat reservoir of rabies, Desmodus rotundus, is being controlled by the application of warfarin-type anticoagulants.

Some preventive measures could be implemented by the people who live in the affected areas themselves, and at minimal costs, if they knew why and how they needed to do it. Public education and information is essential for control and prevention of zoonotic diseases; however, it takes more than civic action to deal with them. Delivery of public education, disease surveillance and diagnosis, and the technical materials and logistical support for control or preventive programs depend on national or international scientific and financial support. International technical cooperation and financial support are imperative.",
