They studied daily nasal wash samples from 19 infants and found that RSV load was significantly higher and RSV shedding more prolonged in those infants with lower respiratory illness. Similarly, Buckingham et al xxxii showed RSV viral loads to be higher in ventilated patients compared to non-ventilated hospitalized patients, a finding very recently mirrored by Scagnolari et al xxxiii .

HGF is produced in the lung by alveolar macrophages, endothelial cells, bronchial cells, and fibroblasts and signals via its receptor, c-Met, which is expressed on endothelial and epithelial cells xxxvi . Signal transduction by HGF promotes normal tissue regeneration and prevents fibrotic remodeling following injury xxxvii ,. The study of HGF in the context of viral lung infection is limited to the observations of Narasaraju et al xxxviii who demonstrated that immunologic blockade of CCL2 signaling during influenza infection resulted in impaired HGF expression and augmented lung injury, while treatment with exogenous CCL2 enhanced HGF expression resulting in reduced lung injury. The specific role of HGF over-expression during moderate and severe RSV infection remains to be defined, but the correlation between illness severity and HGF concentrations and the known biologic functions of this factor suggest that it is produced as a protective mechanism rather than contributing directly to disease pathogenesis. Similarly, while EGF is known to participate in lung epithelial cell growth and repair xxxix , and its receptor EGFR has been shown to interact directly with both RSV xl and influenza virus xli , its specific role during and following viral infection of the lung remains to be explored.",

This strategy has not been used in any of the previously mentioned reports on RSV illness severity, but mirrors a strategy that we have used in studying both adenovirus and parainfluenza virus pathogenesis 23, xlii . Our findings confirm that young age at hospitalization is a predictor of disease severity, and that the youngest patients are hospitalized for the longest durations. Moreover, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that RSV-A infections are more severe than those caused by RSV-B. We found a direct association between NP wash concentrations of 13 different inflammatory mediators and illness severity, five of which have not been previously reported in association with severe RSV disease. Finally, we report for the first time that HGF and EGF, factors known to be important for lung remodeling and repair are expressed in respiratory secretions at higher concentrations during more severe RSV disease, and specifically during infection with RSV-A, a finding worthy of further characterization.
