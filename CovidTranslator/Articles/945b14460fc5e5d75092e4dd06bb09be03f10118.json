This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Study participants were recruited from several constituent colleges of King Saud University and secondary schools in Riyadh. Data were collected using selfadministered, closed-ended questionnaires. Frequencies and proportions were computed for descriptive purposes. Chi square test was utilized to depict statistical difference between groups. Among the 1109 students who answered the questionnaires, 53.1% were male, and 46.9% were female. Level of knowledge about clinical presentation of MERS is generally similar among university and school students. The most frequently reported source of transmission is entering crowded spaces and being exposed to coughing and sneezing. Additionally, hand washing was the most commonly reported method of protection against the infection.

An epidemiological investigation of this study indicated close contact between infected humans and infected camels. Given that several investigations have offered compelling evidence of the association between exposure to camels and the increased risk of acquiring MERS-CoV, precautionary measures were advised for individuals working in close contact with camels such as farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. People were warned to take care when handling raw camel products such as milk and meat and advice issued to prevent cross-contamination of infected products with other food items (WHO, 2014) .",

Among university students, 297 (42%) were male and 399 (57%) were female. However, 292 (70.7%) of the school students were male as compared to 121 (29.3%) who were female. The mean age of the university students was 22.3 (SD: 3.17) whereas the mean age of the school students was 17.3 (SD: 0.97). Table 1 illustrates risk perception of MERS among the students. An attitude of concern about the disease can be generally observed whereas only a minority reported having no concerns. More males than females regard MERS as a very dangerous disease, although there is no statistically significant difference in risk perception between university and school students of either genders.",

However, female university students showed a slightly better understanding of clinical presentation of MERS when compared to male university students. This trend can also be observed among high school female students who showed a higher level of knowledge about the clinical presentation of the disease as compared to male students. The majority of students reported fever and shortness of breath as factors in the clinical presentation of MERS. Apart from reporting cough and nasal and throat congestion, knowledge about clinical presentation of MERS is generally similar among university and school students. Table 3 details knowledge about modes of transmission of MERS-CoV. There is a similar level of knowledge about mode of transmission among university and school students. The most frequently reported source of transmission is entering crowded spaces and exposure to coughing and sneezing. The proportion of students who think handshaking is a mode of transmission is lower than those who think touching surfaces might increase risk of infection. Moreover, only 40% of the participants believe camels are associated with the risk of MERS-CoV infection.",

Additionally, avoiding contact with an infected person was frequently indicated as a prevention method. Nevertheless, a higher proportion of students either questioned or were unaware of the importance of wearing a facemask as a protective method. Similarly, 30% of the participants did not suggest using tissues as a method of prevention. Unlike other components of measuring knowledge about the disease, university students appear to have a higher level of knowledge about protection methods weighed against school students. This notion was evident from responses relating to protection methods such as not touching mucosal membranes, usage of tissues and hand washing. Fig. 1 depicts how social activities are affected by knowledge of MERS. The activity most affected is visiting hospitals followed by traveling for the festivals of Omrah and Hajj. The social activity least affected is visiting family and friends. Apart from going for school, responses to affected activities are generally similar among university and school students.",

The findings suggest a good level of perception about the disease risk. Concern about MERS was shown by elements such as reporting fever and shortness of breath as evidence of clinical presentation of the illness. Indicating shortness of breath as a clinical presentation could be related to the orientation of the students about one of the serious consequences of acquiring MERS-CoV infection when compared to acquiring seasonal influenza. This perception could be treated as a tangible measure of the students' awareness about the seriousness of MERS.",

This is unsurprising given that no official statement was made confirming camels as a source of the virus. Furthermore, as most of the infections were declared to be acquired in healthcare settings, the majority of students preferred to avoid going to hospital indicating a perceived method of precautionary measures against the disease. According to our reading, this study is the first to attempt to measure the perceptions of school and university students about MERS. That being said, a study was conducted by Balkhy et al. (2010) on the Saudi public in order to measure knowledge about swine influenza during the pandemic in 2009 (Balkhy et al., 2010) . This study investigated precautionary measures against catching the disease such as hand washing practice, avoiding touching mucous membranes and using tissues and facemasks. The most frequently reported method of preventing transmission of swine influenza infection was hand washing which is similar to the findings of our study. However, the proportion of responses indicating higher level of knowledge about the illness is markedly larger in our study when compared to the level of knowledge about swine influenza reported in Balkhy et al.
