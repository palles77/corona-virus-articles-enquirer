The purified recombinant proteins of 350 and 366 amino acids in length, respectively, were employed to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of CCoV type I antibodies in dog sera. Four canine sera-positive for CCoV type II, four sera-positive for CCoV type I and 10 negative control sera were examined. Only the sera-positive for CCoV type I strongly reacted with both the proteins, whereas the sera-positive for CCoV type II showed low reactivity in the ELISA test. As CCoV type I seems to be not cultivable in cell cultures, the recombinant fragments of the S protein represent a unique method to study, preliminarily, the immunological and the pathogenetic characteristics of this new virus.",

CCoV is included in the group I of Coronaviridae family with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E). Coronavirus virions contain a single molecule of linear, positive sense RNA ranging from 27.6 to 31 kb. The genome has a 5 -terminal cap followed by a leader sequence of 65-98 nucleotides (nt) and an untranslated region of 200-400 nt. At the 3 end of the genome there is an untranslated region of 200-500 nt followed by a poly(A) tail. The virion RNA functions as an mRNA and is infectious. It contains approximately 7-10 functional genes, 4 or 5 of which encode structural proteins. The genes are arranged in the order 5 -replicase-(HE)-S-E-M-N-3 , with a variable number of other genes that are believed to be non-structural and largely non-essential (Lai and Holmes, 2001) .",

This large protein can be divided into three structural domains. The large external domain at the N-terminus is further divided into two sub-domains S1 and S2. The S1 sub-domain includes the N-terminal half of the molecule and forms the globular portion of the spikes. It contains sequences that are responsible for binding to specific receptors on the membrane of susceptible cells. S1 sequences are variable, containing various degrees of deletions and substitutions in different coronavirus strains or isolates. Mutations in the S1 region have been associated with altered antigenicity and pathogenicity. In contrast, S2 sequences are more conserved and contain two heptad repeat motifs that suggest a coiled-coil structure (Lai and Holmes, 2001) .",

Sequence analysis of the S gene of the strain Elmo/02 revealed low nucleotide (49-51%) and amino acid (44%) identity to the reference CCoV (CCoV type II) and FCoV type II strains, while the highest correlation (73% nt and 74-75% aa) was found with FCoVs type I. The S protein of CCoV type I is characterised by the presence of a stretch of basic residues RRARR that is indicative of a potential cleavage of the protein (Pratelli et al., 2003a) . A similar basic motif is present, approximately in the same position, in the coronaviruses belonging to groups II and III, but it is absent in the coronaviruses of group I, where CCoV type I is included.",

About the three-fourths of the sequence of S gene, approximately 3347 nucleotides, were determined using primer pair sets designed with the CODEHOPE strategy (Rose et al., 1998) , as described previously (Pratelli et al., 2003a) . In order to over express and purify a large region of the S gene in E. coli, two pairs of primers were designed to amplify two different portions of the S gene, of 1050 bp (S66) and 1098 bp (S55), respectively ( Fig. 1 ). Both forward primers contained in position 5 the enzyme restriction site BamHI whereas both reverse primers contained the enzyme restriction site HindIII. The 1050 bp (S66) and 1098 bp (S55) gene fragments encode proteins of 350 and 366 aa with estimated molecular masses of 38.5 and 40 kDa, respectively. The amplified products were cloned into pCR \u00ae 2.1-TOPO \u00ae vectors (TOPO TA Cloning \u00ae , Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). The nucleotide sequence of each insert was subjected to sequence analysis (Genome Express: Labo Grenoble, France) to confirm that no mutations had occurred during the amplification reaction. The cloned sequences were subsequently removed from the pCR \u00ae 2.1-TOPO \u00ae vectors at the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites and transferred to a pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA). The constructs were used to transform E. coli DH5\u2423 cells containing pREP-4",

This indicates that: (i) most CCoV infections are caused by the two genotypes; (ii) CCoV type I is widespread in dogs.

Comparative sequence analysis of the genome of FCoVs type I and II and of CCoV has demonstrated that FCoV type II has arisen from a template switch between FCoV type I and CCoV, which took place between the S and M genes. Consequently, CCoV specific sera neutralize FCoV type II but fail to neutralize, or neutralize poorly, FCoV type I (Rottier, 1999) . Failure of CCoV type I to grow in cell culture hinders the evaluation of serological correlation between CCoV type I and CCoV type II. From this perspective, the expression of the two fragments of the S protein of CCoV type I and their use to develop serological tests or to produce monoclonal antibodies currently represent a powerful and unique tool for research of the new genotype of CCoV.",
