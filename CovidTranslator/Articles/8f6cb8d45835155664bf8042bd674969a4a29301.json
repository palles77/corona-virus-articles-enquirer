Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is a technique which may be used to detect potential ADEs more efficiently. KDD involves the selection of data variables and databases, data preprocessing, data mining and data interpretation and utilization. Data mining encompasses a number of statistical techniques including cluster analysis, link analysis, deviation detection and disproportionality assessment which can be utilized to determine the presence of and to assess the strength of ADE signals. Currently the only data mining methods to be used in pharmacovigilance are those of disproportionality, such as the Proportional Reporting Ratio and Information Component, which have been used to analyse the UK Yellow Card Scheme spontaneous reporting database and the WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre database. The association of pericarditis with practolol but not with other b-blockers, the association of captopril and other angiotensin-converting enzymes with cough, and the association of terfenadine with heart rate and rhythm disorders could be identified by mining the WHO database.",

They are estimated to account for up to 5% of hospital admissions [1] , 28% of all emergency department visits [2] , and 5% of hospital deaths [3] . Many ADEs, such as prescription errors, are preventable [4] , and methods have been suggested to reduce these errors [5, 6] . However other ADEs are unknown at the time of marketing as premarketing studies are generally small, of a short duration, do not detect late-onset or rare adverse effects and, by excluding patients with comorbid disease, have limited generalizability. For example the interaction between terfenadine and cytochromal p450 enzyme inhibitors causing cardiac arrhythmias was only recognized 7 years after licensing [7] . Furthermore, clinical trials typically underplay harm in their reporting [8] . For example, increased risks of serious cardiac events with rofecoxib were suggested by a further analysis [9] of the VIGOR study [10] , which occurred a year after the marketing of this therapy.",

Some authors refer to data mining as the process of acquiring information, whereas others refer to data mining as utilization of statistical techniques within the knowledge discovery process.

The process requires a definition of the project goals, dataset acquisition, data cleaning and preprocessing, data mining, data interpretation and utilization [17] . We will define data mining as the application of statistical techniques, e.g. predictive modelling, clustering, link analysis, deviation detection and disproportionality measures, to databases. All of the above KDD steps are required when embarking on a project from the beginning. However, some researchers take a given database and perform statistical analysis in order to 'mine it' for additional unrecognized information and therefore call the process data mining.",

For this reason, if no signal is produced at the end of the analysis it is not possible to tell whether this is because the signal does not exist or because insufficient data are being analysed. Essentially, once the aims have been defined and the database is prepared for data mining, the statistical techniques attempt to find patterns, or associations or dissimilarities between groups of data in order to generate a signal or detect new information.",

Furthermore, the accuracy of the data contained within the reports is uncertain. However, spontaneous reporting databases do contain large amounts of data, for example the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) spontaneous reporting database contains over 2 million reports over a period of 35 years.

Heeley et al. [25] discuss the role of database exploration in order to detect ADE signals from a PEM database, which contains 1 million reports of events from 78 PEM studies. They point out that a limitation of PEM database mining is the lack of an adequate control group, as the database contains details of clusters of patients exposed to certain drugs. For example, tolterodine did not show evidence of hallucinations as an ADE because the control group contained patients prescribed other drugs known to Table 1 The steps with rationale and examples, of the knowledge discovery in database (KDD) process",

There are two types of predictive modelling, namely classification, for categorical dependent variables, and value prediction, for continuous dependent variables. Classification is appropriate if the goal is to predict group membership of new records based on their characteristics (independent variables). Using classification, the most influential variable is identified and used to split the data into groups. This is then repeated with the next most influential variable until the data are fully characterized. For example, it may be possible to determine a classification criterion or rule that discriminates between different groups of patients with and without side-effects based on age, sex or socio-economic class. Value prediction uses both classification and regression to predict the future outcome of a patient based on, for example, their demographic or socio-economic characteristics. However, we need to use caution as, in any data analysis of continuous outcomes, the results of value prediction can be influenced by the presence of outliers in the data.",

Pairs of records are compared by the values of the individual fields within them, and clustering into groups provides fast and effective ordering in large datasets. Segmentation could be used to group patients with similar symptoms or diagnoses to determine whether there is a drug association. Thus, clustering is a technique of choice if the goal is to reduce a large sample of records to a smaller set of specific homogeneous subgroups (clusters) without losing much information about the whole sample. Because of the heterogeneity between clusters, this analysis can also be helpful in hypothesis development about the nature of the variation between subgroups. For example, if a database contained details of different cardiac pathologies (e.g. valvular heart disease) and medication (e.g. fenfluramine-phentermine), clustering analysis may have segregated patients according to heart disease and identified fenfluramine-phentermine as one of the main factors in this group.

Often causation is not confirmed and other methods such as case-control studies are required to examine the ADE [44, 45] . Once a potential ADE is identified and further investigation substantiates the adverse effect, this information needs to be quickly disseminated via reports to medical practitioners, e.g. the Dear Doctor letters, or articles in the medical literature [46] .

Data mining processes are not able to account for inaccurate or missing Where p(x) = probability that drug 'x' listed on case sheet p(y) = probability that ADE 'y' listed on case sheet p(y,x) = probability that drug-ADE combination 'x' and 'y' listed on case sheet data, and if a signal is not detected it is impossible to determine whether no ADE exists or the data are insufficient. Furthermore, KDD only generates a signal and, in the context of pharmacovigilance, further studies or investigations will be required to confirm a potential ADE. However, by being open minded, it is possible to search for many different ADEs at once. Also, information in many databases is under-utilized, and therefore KDD may be possible to generate new information from existing data sources at minimal extra cost. KDD will not replace traditional methods of pharmacovigilance, but if used in conjunction may reduce the time required for ADE identification [23] . It is impossible to predict the actual circumstances in which KDD will contribute to pharmacovigilance, but one would suspect that rare and atypical events, clusters of symptoms and signs not yet formulated in a diagnosis and common diagnoses not recognized as drug-related could all be flagged earlier and more reliably by employing systematic data mining techniques. Regular and repetitive analyses of accumulating data could maximize the opportunity to detect a signal of an ADE which is only evident after prolonged usage. In the future it may be possible to perform continuous data mining analysis, e.g. link analysis, on large electronic medical records to identify signals in a cost-effective manner.",

When considering the frequency and significance of ADEs, as well as the inadequacy of premarketing ADE evaluation, it is clear that cost-effective methods of quickly identifying potential ADEs are required. Given the availability of larger datasets and faster computer processing speeds, we suggest that data mining techniques will have a greater role in pharmacovigilance in the future.",
