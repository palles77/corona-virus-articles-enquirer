The results showed that the BKoV positive rate for the diarrheic feces (35.42%) was significantly higher than that for the non-diarrheic feces (11.69%, p < 0.001). Interestingly, three potential novel VP1 lineages were identified from 15 complete VP1 sequences, and a unique triple nucleotide insertion which can result in an aa insertion, was first observed in the 11/12 VP0 fragments with 660 bp long in this study, compared with known BKoV VP0 sequences. Moreover, the first Chinese BKoV genome was successfully obtained from a diarrheic fecal sample, named CHZ/CHINA. The open reading frame (ORF) of the genome from strain CHZ/China shares 87.4%-88.3% nucleotide (nt) and 93.7%-96.4% amino acid (aa) identity, compared with the three known genomes of BKoV. Interestingly, phylogenetic tree based on aa sequences of these genomes showed that CHZ/CHINA was clustered into an independent branch, suggesting the strain may represent a novel BKoV strain. The findings contribute to better understanding the molecular characteristics and evolution of BKoV.",

Recently, BKoV was also detected in the spinal fluid from the brain of an 11 day-old calf where the animal had a history of diarrhea and neurological disease (Moreira et al., 2017) , which indicates that this virus can cause systemic infections.",

Viral RNA was extracted from 300 \u03bcl of each fecal suspension using RNAios Plus (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript\u2122 RT Reagent kit according to the manufacturer's https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.103939 instructions (TaKaRa Bio Inc.) and then stored at \u221220\u00b0C.

All PCR products were purified using the Omega Gel kit (Omega), cloned into the pMD19-T simple vector (TaKaRa Bio Inc.), and then sequenced (Sangon Biotech) in both directions. Sequences were assembled using SeqMan software (version 7.0; DNASTAR Inc., WI, USA). Single open reading frames (ORFs) were identified using the online ORF finder at https://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/. Nt and deduced aa sequence homologies were determined using the MegAlign program in DNASTAR 7.0 software (DNASTAR Inc.). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with the Jukes-Cantor model, 1000 bootstrap replicates and default parameters in MEGA 7.

A phylogenetic tree analysis based on all 103 available complete sequences for BKoV VP1 and the 15 VP1 sequences from the present study shows that all the VP1 sequences fall into 8 distinct branches (Fig. 1) . 7/15 VP1 sequences from our study were clustered into the known lineage 2. Interestingly, the remaining 8/15 VP1 sequences from our study were clustered into 3 independent branches distinct from the 5 known lineages, suggesting that these branches may represent 3 novel lineages. The potential lineages 6, 7, 8 share 73.5%-76.7%, 74.0%-78.8% and 74.0%-85.9% nt sequence identity with all complete BKoV VP1, including the VP1 sequences from the present study, respectively. Furthermore, potential lineage 6 contains only 1 strain of B5/HN/China strains; potential lineage 7 contains 2 strains of 9/LN/ China and 14/LN/China, which share 99.8% nt sequence identity with each other; potential lineage 8 contains 5 strains of 3/LN/China, 7/LN/ China, A2/SD/China, A3/SD/China and B21/HN/China strains, which share 90.9%-100% nt sequence identity with each other. Further analysis found that the strain in potential lineage 6 has 5 out of 267 unique aa mutations (P35S, T40S, R98K, T114A, and Y254L), 2 strains in potential lineage 7 share 2 out of 267 unique aa mutations (R43Q and I107V), and 5 strains potential lineage 8 share 1 out of 267 unique aa mutations (E18D), compared to all known complete VP1 sequences of BKoV. A previous study reported that a strain with a nt identity < 85.1% should be considered a novel lineage (Liu et al., 2013) , but the value of 85.1% may be biased, due to the limitation of sequence numbers of BKoV VP1 at that time. Currently, the precise biological function of BKoV VP1 remains unclear. However, information from AIV shows that VP1 is the structural protein to the enteric receptor recognition and may be involved in viral pathogenesis (Zhu et al., 2016) . As VP1 is the most variable immune determinant protein in kobuvirus, VP1 in BKoV, AIV and PKV had been divided into different lineages (Liu et al., 2013; Oh et al., 2006; Pham et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2013) . Further investigations are needed to better understanding the antigenicity of different VP1 lineages.",

A phylogenetic tree based on the three known VP0 aa sequences and the 12 sequences from this study revealed that 11 of the BKoV strains from the present study clustered on an independent branch. The remaining 1 strain from this study and 3 known strains clustered on an independent branch (Fig. 2) . Further analysis found that the 11/12 sequences in an independent branch shared a unique aa insertion in two forms (S63 or N63) in the VP0 region, showing that the VP0 type was the high frequency in Chinese BKoV. Interestingly, a unique aa insertion within the VP0 region also found in AIV strains (Pham et al., 2008) . Hence, whether the variation in VP0 is a potential evolutionary characteristic in kobuvirus needs further to be investigated.",

Compared with 3 known BKoV, with the exception that the CHZ/CHINA strain's VP0 sequence is 3 nt longer, the lengths of the other CHZ/CHINA genes are identical to those of the other three genomes (Table S3 ) and shares 87.4%-88.3% nt and 93.7%-96.4% aa identity. Further phylogenetic analysis based on genomic sequences revealed that CHZ/CHINA clusters on an independent branch, with the three VP0, VP3, VP1 protein aa sequences generating the same result (Fig. 3) , showing that CHZ/CHINA displays a larger genetic distance from the other three genomes and indicating that CHZ/CHINA may represent a novel BKoV strain.
