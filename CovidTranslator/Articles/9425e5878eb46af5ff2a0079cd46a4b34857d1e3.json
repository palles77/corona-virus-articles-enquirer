Use of the HRSA formula resulted in a requirement of 1250 additional hospital beds for the state of Utah, of which 125 beds were designated for patients with severe trauma or burns.",

The hospitals' status reports, submitted every 2 hours, will provide UDOH information to decide when patient transfers are required. The START triage system will be used to determine priorities for patient transport. b. Delivery and transfer of patients: Separate locations will be established by each hospital for patient drop-off and pick-up for transfer. Hospital security personnel must ensure that vehicles are directed to proper locations. c. Additional beds in state: In addition to the 830 beds provided by the 20% increase in authorized beds, analysis of hospital daily census data indicate that an additional 1237 vacant beds would be available in the state. Thus, the 1250 target can be met through these 2 sources. However, the numbers reflect all beds in the state, so hospitals must be prepared to manage excess numbers until transportation can be arranged by UDOH. 3. Patient flow process a. Transfer of patients During an MCI, patients may have to be transferred to create additional available beds. If this action is necessary, UDOH will coordinate transfer of patients.
