The distribution and ecology of BatHEV are not well known. Here, we collected and screened 81 bat fecal samples from nine bat species in Japan to detect BatHEV RNA by RT-PCR using HEV-specific primers, and detected three positive samples. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these three viruses were BatHEVs belonging to genus Orthohepevirus D like other BatHEV strains reported earlier in various countries. These data support the first detection of BatHEVs in Japanese microbats, indicating their wide geographical distribution among multiple bat species.",

In addition, hepatitis E virus (HEV)-like viruses have been detected in bats in several countries [4, 5] . Bat HEV (BatHEV) belongs to family Hepeviridae, genus Orthohepevirus and is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Orthohepevirus is divided into four species, Orthohepevirus A-D [6, 7] . Orthohepevirus A contains HEV, which is a causative agent for human acute hepatitis. Orthohepevirus B includes avian-HEV associated with hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome. Orthohepevirus C is divided into C1 (rodent-HEV) and C2 (carnivore-associated HEV) genotypes. Orthohepevirus D comprises BatHEV, which has 57.4-64.8% identity with HEV [8] . Recently, BatHEVs were detected from macrobats and microbats in a variety of countries [4, 5] . However, limited information about the distribution of BatHEVs in other regions and their ecology is available. Here, we surveyed several Japanese microbat species to detect BatHEVs.",

Bats were caught using a harp trap and kept in a pouch for an hour to check the signs of disease as well as to obtain fresh feces. All captured bats did not show any obvious symptoms. The feces were added in a medium containing antibiotics, and frozen in dry ice. We extracted RNA from the fecal samples and performed RT-PCR using a primer set ( Table 1) that was designed specifically against the conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of HEV, to screen the HEV genomes. Two samples (BtHEV-Ej1 and BtHEV-Ej2) from the Japanese short-tailed bat (Eptesicus japonensis) and 1 sample (BtHEV-Ps1) from the Brown long-eared bat (Plecotus sacrimontis) were found to be positive. Although we attempted to sequence the entire genome of the BatHEVs, we failed to amplify the whole genome using RT-PCR. Therefore, we amplified partial ORF1, which encodes non-structural protein including RdRp, and entire capsid coding region of BtHEV-Ej1, -Ej2, and -Ps1 (corresponding to nucleotides (nt) 2171-6690, nt 3585-6690, and nt 3847-6690 of BatHEV/BS7, respectively) using specific primers ( Table 1 ). The sequences of BtHEV-Ej1 and BtHEV-Ej2, which were collected in the same site on different days, were 99% identical (nt 2904 out of 2915). The identity between BtHEV-Ej1/-Ej2 and BtHEV-Ps1 using a part of the RdRp was about 75% at the nucleotide level, suggesting the presence of multiple BatHEVs in Japan. BLAST analysis indicated that BtHEV-Ej1/-Ej2 showed the highest sequence identities to BatHEV/BS7, a German strain detected from the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus), among strains previously reported in other countries. On the other hand, BtHEV-Ps1 showed the highest sequence identity to BtHEV/NMS098B, a German strain detected from the Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii). In particular, 82% identity observed between BtHEV-Ej1/-Ej2 and BatHEV/BS7 or 77% identity observed between BtHEV-Ps1 and BtHEV/NMS098B were greater than that observed between Japanese strains. These data suggest that similar viruses exist in geographically distant regions.",

Although there is no information about migration of E. japonensis and P. sacrimontis, bat species closely related to them were reported to migrate only a few kilometers from their colonies per night [10, 11] . They had different ecology in the terms of the habitat. BtHEV-Ej1 and -Ej2 were detected on different days from two E. japonensis bats, both of which used eaves of the same house as night roost in Nagano. Although the E. japonensis bats formed mixed colony at the roost with Myotis ikkonikovi and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum bats, BatHEVs were only detected in E. japonensis, implying BtHEV-Ej1/-Ej2 might have a narrow host range. P. sacrimontis bats usually form a small colony without other species of bats. Indeed, P. sacrimontis bats, from which BtHEV-Ps1 was detected in this study, were captured near such small colony in a ruin in Aomori. Thus, BtHEV-Ps1 is likely circulating in the P. sacrimontis since the bats have low opportunity to come in contact with other species of bats.",

All inoculated cells were incubated for 12-15 days with media changes at 2-3 days interval. After the incubation, cells were blindly passaged three times. However, we could neither recover any infectious viruses nor detect BatHEV RNA in the inoculated cells by RT-PCR.",

The feces were suspended well and then centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants were used for RNA extraction with ISOGEN LS reagent (Nippon Gene). cDNA was synthesized using Prime Script RT reagent kit (Takara Bio) with a mixture of random hexamer and oligo dT primers. PCR amplifications were performed using the KOD FX Neo (Toyobo) with consensus HEV primer sets (PanHEV F and R), which were designed in this study to amplify a 191-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent into Orthohepevirus D, in Japanese bats, suggesting wide geographical distribution of BatHEV among multiple bat species. Although these data suggest limited transmissibility of BatHEV to other animals, further studies are needed to determine its zoonotic potential. ",
