After intranasal or intracerebral inoculation of mice, MHV-A59 produces mild acute encephalitis with infection of selected regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and subsequent chronic demyelination .' \u00b0 MHV-A59 infection of mice has been used as an experimental model system to study virusinduced demyelination ; this may be important in the understanding of the pathogenesis of human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) . Studies with MHV-JHM, another neurotropic strain of MHV, have suggested that MHV-induced demyelination is the result of lytic infection of oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cel ls . 5, 6 We have previously shown that although infectious MHV-A59 and viral antigens are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to detect after the first few weeks post-infection, viral genome persists in the white matter of infected mice during the chronic demyelinating stages of the disease .' These findings, along with the observation that MHV-A59 grows preferentially in non-neuronal (as opposed to neuronal) cells in dissociated spinal cord cultures,' suggest that glial cells may be the site of MHV-A59 persistence during chronic demyelination . A recent report showed that MHV-A59 can productively infect astrocytes in vitro . 9 Thus, as part of our approach to understanding the mechanism of MHV-A59 persistence and its possible relationship to demyelination, we studied the interaction between MHV-A59 and oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in vitro using enriched cultures of each cell type, derived from mice . We have used these cultures to complement ongoing in vivo studies for several reasons : (1) the interaction between virus and cell can be studied isolated from other host factors such as the immune system ; (2) unambiguous identification of cell type with the cell-specific markers is more easily accomplished in vitro than in vivo; and (3) a high percentage of a specific cell type as well as a large number of cells are obtained in each culture ; thus oligodendrocytes and astrocytes can be studied separately . We report here that astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are early sites of MHV-A59 infection in vivo and that glial cells support persistent productive MHV-A59 infection in vitro .",

In another study of MHV-A59 in primary glial cell cultures, infection was productive and lytic and virtually all the cells contained viral antigen .' This study differed from ours in that the MHV-A59 strain used was at least 30-fold more lethal in mice and a different strain and age of mice was used to derive the cultures . In studies with JHM, a more neuropathogenic MHV strain, chronic productive infections were established in primary glial cells or enriched oligodendrocyte cultures similar to that which we described .\", \" It was shown that resistance to JHM infection in in vitro rat oligodendrocyte cultures was related to the developmental state of the cells . Perhaps the fact that even at high MOIs in our studies only 10-30% of glial cells expressed viral antigen is related to the physiological or developmental state of the cells .",

Mixed glial cell cultures were derived from 3 week old mice by mincing and trypsinization of brains followed by filtration through nylon mesh and plating onto tissue culture flasks . Oligodendrocytes were purified from these brains by Percoll gradient centrifugation .\" Alternatively, mixed glial cultures were derived from newborm mice and after 2 weeks in culture were subcultured into enriched astrocytes and enriched oligodendrocyte cultures by the procedure of McCarthy and DeVellis 10 designed for rat glial cells as modified for use with mouse cells .\" Briefly, this involves shaking off of the less adherent oligodendrocytes and replating of these cells onto poly-L-lysine coated cover slips (at a concentration of approximately 5x 10 4 cells per cm 2 ) while the astrocytes remain adherent to the tissue culture plastic . In both cases infections were performed on cells at 3-4 weeks of development . In both cases, cultures were similar in terms of percentage of cells containing viral antigen and amount of infectious virus produced . Because the cells were difficult to obtain routinely from the older mice, most of the experiments were performed on cultures derived from the newborn mice . All cells were grown in Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO 2 . The purity of the cultures was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were stained either with antiserum directed against galactocerebroside (GaIC), an oligodendrocyte specific marker, 14 or antiserum against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte specific marker, 13 followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein or rhodamine . As defined by staining with these antisera 3 days after plating, oligodendrocyte enriched cultures consisted of more than 80% oligodendrocytes whereas astrocyte enriched cultures consisted of more than 90% astrocytes .\"",
