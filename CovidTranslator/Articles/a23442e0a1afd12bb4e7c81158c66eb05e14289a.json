When our treatments are accompanied by good quality evidence, we have good estimates of benefit and can consent with access to data on likely acute and long-term harms. The risk benefit ratio of treatment changes in the context of a pandemic. If the likelihood of serious infection increases or the likelihood of the outcome of that infection being more serious increases, then the risk may start to outweigh the benefit. Estimating the harms of COVID infection for cancer patients is currently difficult because there have been too few reported events for modelling. A simple model could use the risk of COVID infection multiplied by risk of serious morbidity/mortality. If a patient has a 5% risk of infection and 10% risk of death from infection there may be a 0.5% mortality through exposure and attendance for radiotherapy. If the patient is young and healthy with a 5% risk of infection and 1% risk of death, then there is 0.05% mortality from COVID-19. The use of chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy is likely to very significantly increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from synchronous COVID-19 infection.",

Brachytherapy may also increase risk of transmission during intubations or upper endoscopic procedures and necessitate increased PPE when they are in short supply. The National Health Service in England announced that from mid-April 2020 all elective surgery would be suspended as an indication of the likely pressures on anaesthetic staff and capacity.

Bringing together small autonomous functional teams will help with this. Staff should be included in discussions around changes in practice such as the fractionation policies described in this paper. Regular communications should be sent, preferably in an electronic bulletin. All staff should be aware of their responsibilities to report infective symptoms and self-isolate if symptomatic.

If working from home is possible then consider allowing staff to do this even when not medically recommended (self-isolation) as this reduces infection risk and the risks of workforce depletion. The NHS in England have reduced guidance that allows for some relaxation of normal data governance to facilitate this sort of working during the crisis and other jurisdictions should follow suit [44] .",

Initial indications from Italy suggest requesting patients to wear protective masks during their stay in the radiotherapy department even if asymptomatic (no cough), in all cases, according to WHO guidelines. The number of positive patients without symptoms is probably higher than initially estimated, and the risk of spread should be kept at minimum [45] As the pandemic progresses it is inevitable that departments will have to deal with the issue of patients who have symptoms of COVID-19 or are confirmed to have the disease. In this scenario different healthcare systems will have different approaches to confirmatory testing. In the absence of a universal policy for testing and the lack of an instant test we should assume a patient with suspicious symptoms is an infectious carrier of the disease. For patients with slow growing or low risk disease it may be oncologically safe to either prematurely or temporarily stop the patient's treatment until they have recovered from infection. In this case any gap should be compensated using an appropriately robust policy using agreed radiobiological parameters [46] . Long gaps may require replanning or reassessment of the CTV as described by teams after Hurricane Maria [2] .",

Preferentially route these patients through the department by separate entrance and exit (consider using emergency or rear exits as separate doorways for this group). These treatments should be concentrated at the end of the day so that adequate decontamination and cleaning procedures can take place overnight before treatments resume the next day.

Prepare, Communicate, Operate and Compensate (PCOC). Look to increase capacity in preparation for reduced workforce by reducing fraction numbers and treatment courses. Make physical adjustments to treatment areas Order, fit and test Personal Protection equipment Order and test IT to allow home working from self-isolation Move clinic plans to remote monitoring / telemedicine /telephone wherever possible Communicate Explain to patients how COVID-19 changes the risk-benefit of standard treatment schedules of radiotherapy Discuss personal protection, safety, hand washing and infection control procedures to all staff but especially radiation therapists with daily physical patient contact. Alert staff groups to any suspected or proven COVID-19 case Operate Consolidate staff into small functional groups that do not depend on other groups and do not move to different clinical areas Consider temperature screening for all users of the radiotherapy centre Quickly disseminate information around COVID cases and agree with patient and staff if treatment will continue with PPE, stop or pause Compensate When treatment is paused agree radiobiological models and alpha/beta values for compensation on treatment restart.
