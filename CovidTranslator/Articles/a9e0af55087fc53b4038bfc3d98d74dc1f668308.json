            "text": "We did a case-control study in five Hong Kong hospitals, with 241 non-infected and 13 infected staff with documented exposures to 11 index patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during patient care. All participants were surveyed about use of mask, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing, as recommended under droplets and contact precautions when caring for index patients with SARS. 69 staff who reported use of all four measures were not infected, whereas all infected staff had omitted at least one measure (p=0\u00b70224). Fewer staff who wore masks (p=0\u00b70001), gowns (p=0\u00b7006), and washed their hands (p=0\u00b7047) became infected compared with those who didn't, but stepwise logistic regression was significant only for masks (p=0\u00b7011). Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients with SARS. The protective role of the mask suggests that in hospitals, infection is transmitted by droplets. On March 12, 2003, WHO issued a worldwide alert for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 1 The hospital authority, which oversees all public hospitals in Hong Kong, had requested cases to be reported centrally since early February, in response to media reports of pneumonia outbreaks in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China. 2 At that time, droplets precautions 3 and rigorous universal precautions 3 or standard precautions 3 were recommended for the care of patients with SARS. Here we report findings of a case-control study assessing the effectiveness of droplets precautions for prevention of nosocomial transmission.",

These levels of response were to ensure that no indicated a definite lapse in practice. Staff who used masks were asked whether it was a paper mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask. The survey, which started on March 15, was done by the hospital's infection-control nurses and all responses were collected by March 24.

The surgical and N95 masks were both effective in significantly reducing the risk of infection, which together with the finding that 30% of non-infected staff did not use masks (table 2) supports that transmission is not airborne. The finding that paper masks did not significantly reduce the risk is not unexpected. Such masks, being easily wet with saliva, are never recommended as a precaution against droplets. 3 In any survey, recall bias is a concern. However, it probably had little effect since the associations shown are clear and the information requested was about simple concrete behaviour and events that took place recently. Masks seem to be essential for protection, since only this measure was significant in stepwise logistic regression. Thus, in hospital, the other three measures add no significant protection to the mask. This finding fits well with droplets transmission because droplets are generated at the face level making the mask crucial for protection.
