Methods: The participants were selected by a multistage, stratified cluster sampling method in Heilongjiang CDC to complete questionnaires that assessed their perceptions of health emergency response skills and techniques. A final sample of 1,740 staff members was obtained and analyzed. Results: The 5 top skill deficiency areas perceived by participants were field epidemiologic investigation, personal protection, effective nuclear and radioactive response as well as psychological interventio (for these two areas gain the equal score), and risk assessment. The logistic regression revealed personal protective skills as the most important factor contributing to the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders, followed by field epidemiologic investigation skills. Conclusions: More attention should be given to emergency response skill training and education programs. Major obstacles hindering the promotion of key skills and techniques among front-line emergency responders should be addressed urgently. Continuous efforts should be made to remove the financial, technical, and resource obstacles to improve public health emergency response capacity.",

            "text": "With advancing industrialization, increasing urbanization, and growing awareness of complicating factors, all nations will be challenged by public health emergencies that have the capacity to adversely influence the security of populations, in terms of both social cohesion and population health. [1] [2] [3] [4] Here in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a sobering reminder of the importance of preparation in relation to public health emergencies. In retrospect, we learned that our response mechanisms to public health emergencies, despite the best of intentions, were imperfect and our ability to cope with such crises required improvement. [5] [6] [7] [8] In response to the SARS experience, the Chinese government at all levels accelerated the reform of emergency response systems to enhance capacity and effectiveness. [9] [10] [11] [12] The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsible for the surveillance and management of public health emergencies through the detection, prevention, and control of diseases. It plays a key role in protecting people from health, safety, and security threats, both in China and in other regions of the world. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that health emergency response skills and techniques adopted by CDC staff directly influence their effective response to public health emergencies. [13] [14] [15] China aimed to establish a comprehensive public health system in recent years; however, an overemphasis on infrastructure might have overlooked problems associated with staff development and skill training that might exert more influence on the consequences of emergency responses. 16, 17 The recent Ebola virus disease epidemic of 2013-2015 tested the efficacy of emergency response mechanisms: Despite extensive preparatory work, 2 nurses were infected by Ebola virus disease in the United States due to their incorrect use of personal protective equipment (PPE). This highlighted the human error factor in response to public health emergencies. 18 Research associated with emergency responses and, in particular those charged with health emergency response skills and techniques, is a relatively new area and studies in China are limited. Liang et al's study, 19 Xiang et al's study, 20 Zhang et al's study, 21 and Bo and Li's study 22 focused on the quantity, allocation, and construction of emergency teams, but the weak competencies of emergency responders turned out to be the key impediment to improving emergency response capacity. These weak competencies could include low levels of technical efficiency; poor field epidemiologic investigation skills; and perhaps most importantly, a lack of staff who had explicit experience and skills in relation to appropriate emergency responses. [23] [24] [25] This study aimed to explore opportunities for enhancing the response capacity of emergency responders by reviewing participants' knowledge, and identify factors associated with the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders.",

All 13 municipalities in Heilongjiang were involved in the study. In each municipality, there are 5-10 counties; we selected 2-4 sampled counties at random in the same proportion (40%). Finally, 40 CDC institutions were sampled. The researchers traveled to 40 CDC institutions to conduct the face-to-face survey, and all the CDC staff were invited to participate, except nonprofessional staff. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University. Each participant was interviewed by an interviewer following a structured questionnaire. All participants indicated his or her willingness to take part both verbally and in consent forms signed before the commencement of interviews. In total, 1,889 individuals completed the questionnaires.",

Our study found that low preparatory education and inadequate numbers of qualified personnel existed in Heilongjiang. The United States attaches great importance to the continuing education of CDC staff through a variety of training approaches. For example, CDC staff can participate in short-term training or promote corresponding knowledge by network and distance education. 32 We suggest that there is a need to improve the preparedness of existing staff in China through formal advanced education, and to review the entry-level requirements for new staff. Consideration may be given to offer senior staff, such as experienced health managers in related areas, an opportunity to undergo additional training and be offered redeployment to improve emergency response capacity. In addition, developing a multidisciplinary public health specialist work- force is also very necessary in China. The UK public health policy has emphasized the importance of a multidisciplinary background among the public health specialist workforce since 1997. 33 In 1999, the Public Health Department of the UK National Health System received other related professional background personnel. 34 Reinforcing skills by developing existing staff training and a multidisciplinary public health specialist workforce should become the priority in the process of health emergency preparedness in the Chinese CDC.",

Other studies show that the lack of experienced and senior staff, laboratory support, and insufficient ongoing funding influenced personnel's capacity to master field epidemiologic investigation skills. 36, 37 The other, weaker skill in public health emergency response shown in this study was personal protection. PPE use is essential to prevent skin and mucous membranes from becoming contaminated. 38 PPE serves as the last physical barrier between a health care provider and infectious agents. In previous outbreaks, health care personnel infections were substantially reduced with the institution of barrier precautions 39 ; however, our survey found that not all the responders were confident in the proficient use of PPE. This was especially problematic in the use of respiratory protective devices and apparatus. The safety of emergency response personnel is dependent upon the prior investment of training in the correct use of PPE. 40 Our survey showed that in some public health emergencies, such as biological or nuclear and radiation accidents, the capacity of personal protection was low. Although this may be related to the sudden and unexpected onset of accidents with resultant environmental contamination in many complex and diverse ways, 41 it seems that proper planning and preparation should prevent poor performance.",

            "text": "The multivariate regression results showed that mastering personal protective skills (or not) was found to have the greatest influence (OR, 2.171) on outcome. During the SARS outbreak, health care providers accounted for 20% of all infected persons. Similarly, the Ebola virus disease crisis that devastated West Africa also resulted in high mortality rates among health care providers. It is pertinent to ask why so many health care providers using PPE and with no history of direct contact became infected. 44, 45 These examples demonstrate the importance of personal protective skills. In our study, field epidemiologic investigation skills were the second highest contributory factor identified that influenced the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders. Epidemiologic investigations are usually conducted in outbreak situations and serve as the key step for stipulating appropriate responses to public health emergencies that influenced the outcome of communicable diseases. 39 Therefore, effective implementation of epidemiologic investigation is a prerequisite to ensure that emergency work is carried out smoothly. Competency in coping with emergency drills is also a key element in the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders (OR, 1.401). For any country, public health emergencies necessitate emergency drills to simulate real emergency experiences to develop and improve skills and to assess emergency response capacity. 46 The US Federal Emergency Management Agency describes 6 levels of emergency drills, increasing in complexity from informational seminars to simulations to implementing emergency response functions. 47 However, emergency drills started relatively late in China and the country has not yet established an effective emergency drill system. So, how to ensure the emergency drill capacity to cope with public health emergencies promptly and properly will be the primary focus of China in the future. With regard to crisis communication skills associated with the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders (OR, 1.372), they are not limited to effective team management, but also include providing public information in a calm and sensitive manner to avoid civil unrest during a public health emergency. People charged with management must take in information, process it, and act on it, often in the absence of all facts or ideal situations being open for consideration. 48 Governments and health agencies worldwide should acknowledge the importance of effective and appropriate communication during public health emergencies. 49 Meanwhile, the availability of experienced staff, the ability to devise an emergency preparedness plan, and field sampling skills were other factors that contributed to the self-rated overall skill proficiency of public health emergency responders.",
