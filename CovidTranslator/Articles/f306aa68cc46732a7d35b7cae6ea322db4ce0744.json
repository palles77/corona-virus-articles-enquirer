The genome sequence of ahysx-1 was found to be very similar to that of IBV strain ck/CH/LLN/131040 (KX252787), except for the spike gene region, which is similar to that of a turkey coronavirus strain (EU022526), suggesting that ahysx-1 is a recombinant. Recombination analysis and phylogenetic analysis based on the genomic sequences of ahysx-1 and other related strains confirmed that ahysx-1 appears to be a recombinant resulting from a recombination event that occurred between a chicken coronavirus and a turkey coronavirus. Further studies need to be performed to determine whether this recombinant IBV strain is pathogenic and whether it is transmitted between chickens and turkeys.",

            "text": "CoVs have an unsegmented, single-stranded, positivesense RNA genome of 28-32 kb, including a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail. Like other CoVs, the 5' two thirds of the IBV genome encodes the 1a and 1ab polyproteins, which are proteolytically cleaved by virus-encoded papain-like and 3C-like proteinases into at least 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2-nsp16) [4] . Like most CoVs, the remaining one third of the genome of IBV encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Generally, the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein is responsible for attachment of the virion to the host cell membrane by interacting with sialic acid, initiating the infection, while the S2 subunit mediates fusion of the virion and cellular membranes by acting as a class I viral fusion protein [5, 6] . Two or three small accessory proteins (genes 3, 4 and 5) that vary in number and sequences among IBV strains are interspersed among the genes coding for the structural proteins. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) usually contain important structural elements and are involved in replication and/or translation [7] . In November of 2016, 10 fecal samples were collected 10 apparently healthy chickens on a commercial chicken farm in Anhui province, China. These samples were subjected to viral nucleic acid detection using the viral metagenomic method. All fecal samples were collected using disposable materials and shipped on dry ice. The samples were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to make a 10% suspension and mixed thoroughly by vortexing. Fecal suspensions were then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 \u00d7 g. One hundred \u03bcL of each supernatant was then collected, and the samples were pooled. The pooled supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-mm filter (Millipore) to remove eukaryotic and prokaryotic particles and then treated with a mixture of nuclease enzymes to reduce the concentration of nonviral nucleic acids [8] . Total nucleic acid was extracted using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A reverse transcription reaction using reverse transcriptase (SuperScript IV, Invitrogen) was performed using the enriched viral nucleic acid preparation and 100 pmol of random hexamerprimer, followed by a round of DNA synthesis using Klenow fragment polymerase (New England Biolabs). A library was then constructed using a Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform with 250-bp paired-end reads with dual barcoding. Bioinformatics analysis was performed as described previously [9, 10] . Briefly, paired-end reads of 250 bp generated by Illumina MiSeq were debarcoded, and the sequencing data were processed using in-house analysis pipeline running on a 32-node Linux cluster. Reads that were identical from bases 5 to 55 were considered duplicates, and only one copy of these duplicates was randomly kept. Low-quality tails of each read were trimmed with Phred with a quality score threshold of 10. Adaptors were removed using VecScreen with default parameters. The cleaned reads were assembled de novo within each barcode using the ENSEMBLE assembler [9] . Contigs and unassembled reads were then matched against a customized viral protein database using BLASTx with an E-value cutoff of < 10 \u22125 . Putative viral hits are then matched against an in-house non-virus non-redundant (NVNR) protein database to remove false positive viral hits. Contigs with no significant similarity to viral proteins in the BLASTx search were used to search the vFam database [11] using HMMER3 [12] [13] [14] to detect remote similarities to viral proteins.",

SRX6816578 and were assembled de novo. The contigs and unassembled reads were then compared to the GenBank viral database using BLASTx, and it was found that this library contained abundant sequences reads showing similarities to putative mammalian or avian viruses belonging to the families Coronaviridae (17,209 reads), Picornaviridae (7185 reads), Circoviridae (642 reads), Picobirnaviridae (362 reads), Caliciviridae (81 reads), Adenoviridae (79 reads), and Astroviridae (26 reads). By assembling the 17,209 reads showing similarity to coronaviruses, a nearly complete genome sequence was obtained, which was 27,718 bp in length, excluding the 24-bp poly(A) tail. The nearly complete genome sequence was deposited in the GenBank database under accession no. MK142676 and the strain name ahysx-1. This sequence contains 10 open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 1A) . A BLASTn search indicated that although 87% of the genome of ahysx-1 shows 98% sequence identity to infectious bronchitis virus strain ck/CH/LLN/131040 (KX252787), the spike (S) genes of these two strains were only 58% identical. A BLASTn search based on the S gene sequence showed that ahysx-1 shared 79% sequence identity with turkey coronavirus isolate TCoV-ATCC (EU022526), which was isolated from the small intestine of a turkey [15] , suggesting that ahysx-1 is a recombinant.",

These complete genome sequences, together with that of ahysx-1, were aligned using the Clustal W program [16] . Possible recombination sites and potential parental sequences were identified using Recombination Detection Program 4.0 (RDP 4.0), which includes seven different test methods: RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiSCan, and 3Seq [17] (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). The results obtained using all seven recombination detection methods indicated with a high degree of confidence (p-value < 6.2 \u00d7 10 \u221215 ) that ahysx-1 is a potential recombinant resulting from a recombination event occurring between a member of the lineage represented by the five infectious bronchitis virus strains as the major parent and a member of the lineage including the three turkey coronaviruses and the guinea fowl coronavirus as the minor parent. A manual bootscan analysis comparing the complete genome sequence of ahysx-1 to the complete genome sequences of a representative major parent (KX252781) and a representative minor parent (EU022526) using the program RDP4.0 was then performed, and this confirmed the potential recombination event. In the nonspike regions, ahysx-1 showed higher sequence similarity to the major parental strain, while in the spike region, ahysx-1 displayed higher sequence similarity to the minor parental strains (Fig.1B) . To confirm this result, phylogenetic analysis was performed separately, using only the non-spike region preceding the S gene, the S gene, and the non-spike region following the S gene to compare ahysx-1 and the other nine reference strains used in the recombination analysis. All phylogenetic trees were constructed based on an alignment of nucleotide sequences, using the maximum-likelihood (ML) method with 1,000 bootstrap resamplings of the alignment data and visualized using the program MEGA7.0 [18] . The resulting trees are shown in Fig. 1C , D and E. The trees based on the non-spike regions ( Fig. 1C and D) show that ahysx-1 clustered closely with the five chicken infectious bronchitis virus strains, while the tree based on the S gene showed that ahysx-1 clustered with the three turkey coronaviruses and the guinea fowl coronavirus, sharing 74.8%-75.9% sequence identity in pairwise sequence alignments (Fig. 1E) . The above data indicate that ahysx-1 might be a recombinant that was produced by recombination between coronaviruses from a chicken and a turkey.",
