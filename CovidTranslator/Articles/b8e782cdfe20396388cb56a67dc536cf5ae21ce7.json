While the reduction in the sodium current manifests with characteristic electrocardiographic abnormalities, patients with the Brugada syndrome are often healthy and unaware of their genetic predisposition. As a result, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is often made following syncope or aborted sudden cardiac arrest. 4 Fever, alcohol, and medications causing sodium channel blockade are well described provocative triggers that may incite arrhythmia in patients with the Brugada syndrome. 5 Here, we report a novel case of syncope due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced fever in a patient with previously unrecognized Brugada syndrome.",

Those with a type 2 Brugada ECG pattern and pertinent clinical features require a class I antiarrhythmic drug challenge to induce a type 1 Brugada ECG pattern in order to meet the diagnosis of the Brugada syndrome. 9 Discerning the difference between the Brugada syndrome and the Brugada pattern with no relevant clinical features is important for patient management. An ICD implantation is a class 1 indication in patients with the Brugada syndrome that survived a cardiac arrest and/or has a history of spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia. 9 On the other hand, asymptomatic patients with the Brugada ECG pattern but no clinical signs and family history suggestive of the Brugada syndrome do not benefit from a defibrillator. 10 In patients without a clear indication for an ICD but presenting with high clinical suspicion for the Brugada syndrome, other clues may help guiding treatment.",

In addition to standard isolation procedures for patients diagnosed with COVID-19, those with known or suspected Brugada ECG patterns may warrant more aggressive anti-pyretic therapy and serial screening ECGs. In addition, when managing a febrile patient with syncope, an ECG must be a part of the evaluation. Defibrillator implantation should be strongly considered in individuals with a provoked type 1 Brugada ECG pattern.",
