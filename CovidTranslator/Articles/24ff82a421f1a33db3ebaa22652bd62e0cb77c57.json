We assumed that the reporting rate, r(t), started increasing since January 17, and stopped at the maximal level at January 21. The time window of the reporting rate increase accounts for the official report on improving the 2019-nCoV surveillance released by the Chinese government by the end of January 21 [10], which also coincides with the average of the incubation periods of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, i.e., the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), i.e., 5 days [11] [12] [13] .

We illustrated six scenarios with 0-(no change), 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 4-and 8-fold increase in reporting rate, see Following previous studies [14, 15] , we modelled the epidemic curve obeying the exponential growth. The nonlinear least square (NLS) framework is adopted for data fitting and parameter estimation. The intrinsic growth rate (\u03b3) of the exponential growth was estimated, and the basic reproduction number could be obtained by R0 = 1/M(\u2212\u03b3) with 100% susceptibility for 2019-nCoV at this early stage. The function M(\u2022) is the Laplace transform, i.e., the moment generating function, of the probability distribution for the serial interval (SI) of the disease [14, 16] , denoted by h(k) and k is the mean SI. Since the transmission chain of 2019-nCoV remains unclear, we adopted the SI information from SARS and MERS, which share the similar pathogen as 2019-nCoV. We modelled h(k) as Gamma distributions with mean of 7.6 days and standard deviation (SD) of 3.4 days for MERS [17] , and mean of 8.4 days and SD of 3.8 days for SARS [18] as well as their average, see the row heads in Table 1 for each scenario.",

The coefficient of determination, R-squared, ranges from 0.91 to 0.92 for all reporting rate changing scenarios, which implies that the early outbreak data were largely following the exponential growth. In Table1, we estimated that the R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 5.71 (95%CI: 4.24-7.54) associated with 8-fold to 0-fold increase in the reporting rate. All R0 estimates are significantly larger than 1, which indicates the potential of 2019-nCoV to cause outbreaks. Since the official diagnostic protocol was released by WHO on January 17 [8] , an increase in the diagnosis and reporting of 2019-nCoV infections probably occurred. Thereafter, the daily number of newly reported cases started increasing around January 17, see Fig 1, which implies that more infections were likely being diagnosed and recorded. We suggested that changing in reporting might exist, and thus it should be considered in the estimation, i.e., 8-, 4-and 2-fold changes are more likely than no change in the reporting efforts. Although six scenarios about the reporting rate were explored in this study, the real situation is difficult to determine given limited data and (almost) equivalent model fitting performance in terms of Rsquared. However, with increasing reporting rate, we found the mean R0 is likely to be around 2 and 3.",

In this work, we employed the SIs of SARS and MERS as approximations to that of 2019-nCoV. The determination of SI requires the knowledge of the chain of disease transmission that needs sufficient number of patient samples and periods of time for follow-up [19] , and thus this is unlikely to be achieved shortly. However, using SIs of SARS and MERS as approximation could provide an insight to the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV at the early stage of the outbreak. We reported that the mean R0 of 2019-nCoV is likely to be from 2.24 (8-fold) to 3.58 (2-fold), and it is largely in the range of those of SARS, i.e., 2-5 [11, 18, 20] , and MERS, i.e., 2.7-3.9 [12] .",
