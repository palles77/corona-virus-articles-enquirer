Measure progesterone in serum to optimize breeding timing (see Chapter 2) . \u2022 Subclinical uterine infection may occur. Collect a specimen for culture from the anterior vagina, 561 using a guarded swab, early in proestrus. Moderate to heavy growth of a single organism is significant. Treat with an appropriate antibiotic, based on culture and sensitivity testing, for 2-4 weeks. \u2022 Brucellosis is associated with infertility in bitches and dogs. Regular serologic testing is recommended in all breeding animals (see Chapter 7). \u2022 Hypothyroidism is associated with irregular cycles in the bitch and poor semen quality in the male dog. Concurrent measurement of free thyroxine (T4) by dialysis and of canine thyroid-stimulating hormone (cTSH) in serum is the diagnostic scheme ofchoice. Appropriate supplementation of hypothyroid animals mayor may not effect a change to normal fertility. Hypothyroidism may be hereditary. \u2022 Abnormal semen quality may be associated with apprehension at the time of breeding or semen collection, prostate disease (see Chapter 17), testicular disorders (see Chapter 16), brucellosis (see Chapter 7) , or hypothyroidism. \u2022 Infertility in cats \u2022 Queens are seasonally polyestrous. If the environment is such that the queen is not exposed to at least 10 hours oflight daily, she may not cycle. \u2022 A queen should be brought to the tom's environment. Copulation must take place at least four times during estrus to reliably induce ovulation. Serum progesterone concentration greater than 2 ng ml after the queen goes out of behavioral estrus is indicative ofovulation having occurred. \u2022 Viral causes of pregnancy loss in the queen include feline leukemia, feline infectious peritonitis, feline herpesvirus (rhinotracheitis), and panleukopenia. Toxoplasmosis and bacterial infections are uncommon causes of pregnancy loss in queens. \u2022 Semen evaluation in tom cats is challenging; cystocentesis after copulation is a noninvasive technique that allows assessment for spermatogenesis but not evaluation of semen quality. Electroejaculation can be performed in anesthetized tom cats.",

Diagnosis requires measurement of progesterone in serum during the intermediary anestrous period (serum progesterone concentration less than 2 ng/ml indicates that ovulation has not occurred) and after the second period of estrous activity (serum progesterone concentration greater than 2 ng/ ml indicates that ovulation has occurred).

            "text": "\u2022 Behavior: Dominant bitches may not allow male dogs to mount and achieve intromission. The problem is best circumvented by artificial insemination (see Chapter 3) . fold prolapse is protrusion of edematous vaginal tissue through the vulvar lips. This is an estrogen-mediated phenomenon that subsides when serum estrogen concentrations decline and that often recurs during subsequent heat cycles. Bitches with vaginal prolapse usually must be bred by artificial insemination because male dogs mount but have difficulty achieving intromission of the penis in the presence of the prolapsed vaginal tissue. Vaginal prolapse may redevelop near the time of parturition and may or may not cause dystocia. 4'. The bitch shows normal breeding behavior, but the male does not mount or achieve intromission and ejaculation. Hypoluteoidism: Hypoluteoidism is inadequate progesterone secretion from luteal tissue during pregnancy. Insufficiency of corpora lutea may predispose the bitch to premature labor as serum progesterone concentrations fall too early in gestation. Serum progesterone concentration must be greater than 2 ng/ml to support pregnancy. Routine supplementation with progestogens is not recommended during pregnancy because excessive progesterone may masculinize female fetuses and prevent expulsion of nonviable fetuses. If serum progesterone concentrations are documented to decrease too early in gestation, supplementation may be instituted with progesterone in oil (2 mg/kg administered intramuscularly every 3 days) or ally-trenbolone (Regumate; Hoechst-Roussell, Kansas City, Mo.; 0.088 mg/kg administered orally once daily) to no later than 61 days after ovulation. Serum progesterone concentrations must decline before labor is initiated in bitches; maintenance of pregnancy beyond 65 days after ovulation by artificial supplementation with progesterone causes fetal death. 7. Semen quality is normal. (Proceed to 8.) 7'. Semen quality is not normal. (Proceed t09.) 8. In a bitch with no reproductive tract disease bred to a male with normal semen quality in which pregnancy does not occur, poor breeding management is the most likely problem. Improper timing of breeding is the most common causeof apparent infertility in dogs. Breeding management is optimized with measurement of progesterone in serum to pinpoint ovulation time within the bitch's estrous cycle. Serum progesterone concentration is 5-8 ng/ml on ovulation day, and the optimal breeding day in bitches is 2 days after ovulation (see Chapter 2). 9. Semen quality, although abnormal, is adequate to effect pregnancy. (Proceed to 10.) A minimum of 250 million normal spermatozoa per ejaculate must be introduced into the bitch's reproductive tract to reliably effect pregnancy. Male dogs with abnormal motility or morphology of spermatozoa and a high total number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate may still be capable of effecting pregnancy. For example, a male with 1 billion spermatozoa in his ejaculate, only 50% of which are morphologically normal, still has 500 x 10 6 morphologically normal spermatozoa, which is well above the 250 x 10 6 required. Optimization of conception rate by breeding 2 days after ovulation, as assessed by serial measurement of serum progesterone concentrations, is strongly recommended when using a subfertile male dog. g'. Semen quality is insufficient to effect pregnancy.",

Causes may be pretesticular, testicular, or posttesticular. Pretesticular causes include apprehension at the time of semen collection or breeding; administration of drugs that impair spermatogenesis, such as high dosages of glucocorticoids or antineoplastic agents; hypothyroidism (see 1'); and inguinal or scrotal hernia. Diagnosis ofincomplete ejaculation as a result of apprehension may be made based on measurement of alkaline phosphatase in seminal fluid. Alkaline phosphatase in semen arises from the cauda epididymis; concentrations ofless than 5000 IV/L in seminal fluid suggest that no fluid from the epididymis is present in the seminal fluid. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase in seminal fluid cannot differentiate incomplete ejaculation from obstructive causes of azoospermia. Testicular causes include intersex states; bilateral cryptorchidism; any thermal or physical insult to the testicular tissue, such as high fever or trauma occurring during the 2 months or more preceding lack of spermatozoa in the ejaculate; and testicular neoplasia (see Chapter 16) . Posttesticular causes include sources of epididymal occlusion, such as spermatocele or sperm granulomas. Epididymal occlusion may be visualized during scrotal ultrasonography. \u2022 Oligozoospermia is presence of fewer than 300 million spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Apparent oligozoospermia may occur in dogs with retrograde ejaculation, which is movement of spermatozoa into the urinary bladder during ejaculation instead of through the penile urethra. The cause of retrograde ejaculation in dogs is unknown. Diagnosis is made based on a collection of urine by cystocentesis after ejaculation, with demonstration of an abnormally large number of spermatozoa in the urine sediment. Antegrade ejaculation can be effected by administration of the sympathomimetic drug, pseudoephedrine (4-5 mg/kg administered orally 1 and 3 hours before breeding). Teratozoospermia is presence ofless than 80% morphologically normal spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Asthenozoospermia is presence ofless than 70% progressively motile spermatozoa in the ejaculate. Oligozoospermia, teratozoospermia, and asthenozoospermia often occur concurrently. Causes include infection of the reproductive tract, localized either in the prostate (see Chapter 17) or testes (see Chapter 16) and including canine brucellosis (see 6'), testicular neoplasia (see Chapter 16), and hypothyroidism (see 1'). 10.

Depending on the extent of the anomaly, surgical repair may be attempted or the problem circumvented with artificial insemination and possible cesarean section; vaginal anomalies may relax sufficiently under the influence of the hormone relaxin late in gestation to permit spontaneous whelping. \u2022 Vaginalfold prolapse (see Chapter 13): Vaginal",

Similarly, a male dog may be hesitant to approach a bitch that has been aggressive toward him, as may occur if the bitch is presented to the male too early in her season. Male dogs that consistently have been disciplined for showing breeding behavior at inappropriate times may inadvertently have been trained not to show such behavior.\u2022 Pain: Male dogs with prostate disease (see Chapter 17) or pain of the spine or rear limbs may be unable or unwilling to mount the bitch and ejaculate. Complete physical and neurologic examinations and a workup for prostate disease, including semen cultures and imaging with possible aspirate or biopsy of the prostate, may be needed to localize the source of pain. \u2022 Poor libido:Libido is variable in male dogs, and those with poor libido are difficult to manage clinically. Ejaculation may be effected by administration ofGnRH (1-2 /lg/kg subcutaneously 2-3 hours before attempted breeding). GnRH causes release of endogenous LH, which stimulates release of testosterone. This technique for enhancing reproductive performance should not be used routinely in valuable stud dogs because persistent stimulation of testosterone release may lead to a decrease in the normal, pulsatile spontaneous release of testosterone, which is necessary for maintenance of spermatogenesis. 5.

Pregnancy is not maintained.\u2022 Infectious causes of pregnancy loss include the following (see Chapter 7): Herpesvirus: Canine herpesvirus causes fetal death and is manifested as pregnancy loss late in gestation, stillbirths, and early neonatal death. Dogs infected in the last 3 weeks of gestation or during the first 3 weeks oflife are most likely to show clinical signs. Bitches infected before or after the last 3 weeks of pregnancy usually are asymptomatic. Most bitches lose at most one litter to canine herpesvirus, apparently creating enough -Dogs do not produce any hormone unique to pregnancy, precluding pregnancy diagnosis early in gestation. Therefore lack of conception cannot be differentiated from early embryonic death. Conception is proved by positive pregnancy diagnosis (see ChapterS).",

A sample of the vaginal discharge should be collected for culture and sensitivity, and empirical treatment with amoxicillin (20 mg/kg administered orally twice a day) should be instituted pending culture results. Radiography or ultrasonography may be necessary to ensure complete expulsion of uterine contents. Bacterial abortion may occur in cats infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) secondary to viral immunosuppression. Protozoal infection: Toxoplasmosis is a protozoal cause of abortion in the queen. Although most queens infected with toxoplasmosis are asymptomatic carriers, those that become systemically ill may abort and may show dys-pnea, lethargy, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and central nervous system disturbance. Abortion occurs secondary to debilitating disease of the queen. Toxoplasmosis is an uncommon cause offeline abortion. Viral infection: Viral infections that may cause abortion in queens include feline herpesvirus (FHV; rhinotracheitis), panleukopenia, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) , and FeLV. Abortion secondary to FHV usually occurs at 5-6 weeks of gestation and is most likely a nonspecific reaction to the upper respiratory infection induced because the virus has not been demonstrated in aborted placental or fetal tissues in cats inoculated with FHV. This virus is easily controlled with vaccination. Cats entering the cattery from outside should be vaccinated well before entry. The intranasal vaccine can safely be used in kittens as young as 3 weeks. Panleukopenia infection can cause abortion, stillbirths, and cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens infected in utero, with or without classic gastrointestinal signs in the queen. The organism is shed in all body secretions from infected animals but is easily killed by bleach. Vaccination ofall animals in the cattery and any animals entering the cattery should be required. Pregnant queens should not be vaccinated with the modified live virus vaccine. Abortion resulting from infection with FIP occurs late in gestation and often is associated with prolonged vaginal bleeding. The disease is difficult to diagnose with serologic testing because titers of the coronavirus causing FIP are indistinguishable from those of the nonpathogenic enteric coronavirus. Control involves good hygiene and avoiding use ofcommunal feeding dishes. Inbreeding increases susceptibility to infection with FIP; removal of adults that sire offspring that become infected may be warranted in problem catteries. FeLV has been reported to cause abortion from 3 weeks of pregnancy to term. Because FeLV requires intimate contact between animals for spread, testing and removal of infected animals constitute an effective method of control. 8. The male has normal semen quality.
