To this end, some methods have been proposed to estimate untraced contacts 10 , undetected international cases 11 , or the actual infected cases in Wuhan and Hubei province based on statistics models 12 , or the epidemic outside Hubei province and overseas 6, [13] [14] [15] .

The adding of a new quarantined sate is driven by data, which together with the recovery state takes replace of the original R state in the classical SEIR model. Their relations are given in Fig. 1 and characterized by a group of ordinary differential equations (or difference equations if we consider discrete time, see SI). Constant N = S + P + E + I + Q + R + D is the total population in a certain region. The coefficients {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 \u22121 , \u03b4 \u22121 , \u03bb(t), \u03ba(t)} represent the protection rate, infection rate, average latent time, average quarantine time, cure rate, and mortality rate, separately.

As confirmed in Fig. 2a -d, the cure rate \u03bb(t) is gradually increasing with the time, while the mortality rate \u03ba(t) quickly decreases to less than 1% and becomes stabilized after Jan. 30th. This phenomenon is likely raised by the assistance of other emergency medical teams, the application of new drugs, etc. Furthermore, the average contact number of an infectious person is calculated in Fig. 2e-f and could provide some clue on the infection rate. It is clearly seen that the average contact number is basically stable over time, but shows a remarkable difference among various regions, which could be attributed to different quarantine policies and implements inside and outside Hubei (or Wuhan), since a less severe region is more likely to inquiry the close contacts of a confirmed case. A similar regional difference is observed for the severe condition rate too. In Fig. 2g -h, Hubei and Wuhan overall show a much higher severe condition rate than Shanghai. Although it is generally expected that the patients need a period of time to become infectious, to be quarantined, or to be recovered from illness, but we do not find a strong evidence for the necessity of including time delay (see SI for more details). As a result, the time-delayed equations are not considered in the current work for simplicity.",

With respect to the parameters and initial conditions listed in Table 1 , we make an astonishing finding that, for all three cases, the outbreaks of COVID-19 all point to 20-25 days before Jan. 20th (the starting date for public data and our modeling). It means the epidemic of COVID-19 in these regions is no later than Jan. 1st (see Fig. 5d ), in agreement with reports by Li et al. 5, 33, 34 . And in this stage (from Jan. 1st to Jan. 20th), the number of total infected cases follows a nice exponential curve with the doubling time around 2 days. This in some way explains why statistics studies with either exponential functions or logistic models could work very well on early limited data points. Furthermore, we notice the number of infected cases based on inverse inference is much larger than the reported confirmed cases in Wuhan city before Jan. 20th.",

Meanwhile, for most parts of mainland including the majority of cities in Hubei province, it will be no later than the middle of March. We should also point out that the situation in Wuhan city is still very severe. More effective policies and more efforts on medical care and clinical research are eagerly needed.
