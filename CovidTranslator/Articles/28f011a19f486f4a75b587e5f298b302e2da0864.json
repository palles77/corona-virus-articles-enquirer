            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis, first described in 1963, is a highly fatal, progressive, and immunopathological disease of domestic and wild Felidae (Holzworth, 1963) . FIP occurs worldwide and is currently one of the leading infectious causes of death in cats. The causative agent of FIP, feline coronavirus (FCoV), is ubiquitous in virtually all cat populations, with seropositivity of up to 90% depending on environment and geographical area. From the seropostive cats, 5-12% eventually develop FIP (Addie and Jarrett, 1992) . FCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positivesense RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family within the order of the Nidovirales (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) . FCoVs are classified into two serotypes (I and II) according to the amino acid sequence of the spike protein (Herrewegh et al., 1998) . In addition, each serotype can be further divided into two distinctly different pathotypes, based on their pathogenicity in cats. The most common pathotype in the field, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), causes a mild, often unapparent enteric infection. In sharp contrast, infection with the virulent pathotype, designated Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, coronavirus-induced systemic disease in domestic and wild felids. The pathology associated with FIP (multifocal granulomatous vasculitis) is considered to be elicited by exaggerated activation and subsequent extravasation of leukocytes. As changes in the expression of adhesion molecules on circulating leukocytes precede their margination and emigration, we reasoned that the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules may be altered in FIP. In present study, the expression of principal adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte transmigration (CD15s, CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD49d, and CD54) on peripheral blood leukocytes from cats with naturally occurring FIP (n = 15) and controls (n = 12) was quantified by flow cytometry using a formaldehyde-based rapid leukocyte preparation technique. T-and B-lymphocytes from FIP patients exhibit higher expression of both subunits (CD11a and CD18) composing the b 2 integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1. In addition, the expression of the a 4 subunit (CD49d) of the b 1 integrin very late antigen (VLA)-4 was elevated on B-lymphocytes from FIP patients. The expression of CD11b and CD18, that combine to form the b 2 integrin macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1), was elevated on monocytes, whereas the density of CD49d was reduced on this population in FIP.",

            "text": "\u00df 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), manifests as a devastating, highly lethal systemic disease called FIP (Pedersen, 1987) . FIP is characterized by fibrinous to granulomatous serositis, often with protein-rich effusions in body cavities, and (pyo)granulomatous inflammatory lesions in various organs (Weiss and Scott, 1981a,b) . In the heterogeneous and sometimes confusing histopathological picture of FIP one distinct feature stands out: the multifocal granulomatous vasculitis, restricted to small and medium-sized veins. Morphologically, the vasculitis is typified by a venous and perivenous circular cell infiltrate dominated by monocytes/macrophages intermingled with a few neutrophils and lymphocytes (Kipar et al., 1998) . The vasculitis has previously been regarded to be induced by a type III hypersensitivity reaction, involving the deposition of immune complexes within venules leading to complement activation (Jacobsegeels et al., 1982; Pedersen and Boyle, 1980) . However, Kipar and co-workers demonstrated that the morphology, cellular composition, and distribution of the vascular lesions in FIP differs significantly from immune-complex-mediated vascular inflammatory processes. Furthermore, the demonstration of FCoV antigen within intravascular leukocytes and among cells in the FIP granulomas indicates that the phlebitis is initiated by activated and FCoV-infected circulating monocytes. Excessive numbers of activated monocytes will emigrate out of the blood circulation and accumulate perivenously. The exaggerated extravasation is associated with enhanced local release of matrix metalloproteinases B (MMP 9) leading to endothelial barrier dysfunction (Kipar et al., 2005) . Considering the importance of leukocyte extravasation in the pathogenesis of FIP, comparatively few studies have been aimed at investigating this key pathogenic event. A crucial step in the process of leukocyte recruitment into the parenchyma is the adherence of circulating leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells (EC), which is facilitated by adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of participating cells. Based on their biochemical properties and molecular structure, these adhesion molecules have been grouped into three gene families: the selectins, the integrins, and the immunoglobulin (Ig) supergene family (Carlos and Harlan, 1994) . The initial adhesive interaction involves the participation of endothelial selectins that bind with sialyl lewis X (sLex, CD15s) carbohydrate moieties, which can be found on the terminal domains of glycoproteins expressed on the leukocyte surface. Because of its relative low affinity nature, this binding results under hydrodynamic shear flow in leukocyte rolling along the vessel wall. The transiently bound leukocytes are subsequently activated on encountering immobilized chemokines at the endothelial surface. This activation step enables the strengthening of the adhesive forces and leukocytes become firmly attached to the endothelium. This firm adhesion is achieved by the interplay between integrins and Ig supergene family receptors (Ebnet and Vestweber, 1999) . The integrins are heterodimer glycoproteins consisting of two non-covalently associated dissimilar proteins designated a and b chain. The integrins are divided into different groups dependent on the common b chain. The b 2 (CD18) subunit combines with a L (CD11a) subunit to build lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 or with a M (CD11b) to form macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1). They are responsible for interactions with intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (CD54), present constitutively on EC and markedly induced during inflammation. The b 1 integrins named very late antigen (VLA) share a common b 1 (CD29) chain that can be linked with a number of a chains. The VLA-4 receptor contains a 4 subunit (CD49d) and is one of the b 1 integrins responsible for leukocyte extravasation due to its interaction with vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 present on activated endothelium. Both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 belong to the Ig supergene family and are built of several immunoglobulin domains (Barreiro and Sanchez-Madrid, 2009; Carlos and Harlan, 1994) . Given the large number of leukocytes in FIP lesions, we hypothesized that FIPV infection could alter the expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes. This might favor leukocyte-endothelial adherence and subsequent migration, thereby inducing endothelial cell damage and contributing to the pathogenesis of FIP. Despite their critical role in the pathological outcome, the expression of adhesion molecules on peripheral leukocytes during FIPV infection remains mainly undescribed. Identification of adhesion molecules with altered expression in FIP will not only provide invaluable insights to further elucidate the pathogenesis but this essential data can also assist in the development of more accurate diagnostic methods.",

Thereafter, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with saturating amounts of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the different adhesion molecules (CD15s, CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD49d, or CD54) in separate tubes for 1 h at 37 8C. After a washing step, Alexa fluor 647conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG 1 or IgM Abs (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, USA) were added and incubation was carried out for 1 h at 37 8C. Next, the residual free binding sites of the secondary Abs were saturated by adding an excess of non-specific subclass matched Abs raised in the same species as the primary Abs against the adhesion molecules (mouse IgG 1 or IgM) for 30 min at 37 8C. In the second stage of the staining procedure, the samples were divided over three additional tubes to define the different leukocyte subsets within each adhesion molecule. T-cells were identified by anti-CD3 mAbs (Nishimura et al., 2004) , visualized with the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG 3 Abs (Molecular probes). Anti-CD21 mAbs prelabeled with Alexa fluor 488-conjugated Fab fragments (Zenon mouse IgG 1 , labeling kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) was used as marker for B-cells. A double staining with anti-CD13 and anti-granulocytes (VMRD Inc., Pullman, WA, USA), preconjugated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 488 or R-phycoerythrin (PE) Mouse IgG 1 labeling kits (Invitrogen) respectively, was performed to distinguish the monocytes (only CD13 positive) and the granulocytes (double positive). Control samples for each antibody, prepared with subclass matched irrelevant mAbs, were run in parallel to identify non-specific background fluorescence. The mAbs with human or dog as target species either reacted with cat according to the manufacturer (CD11b, CD18, and CD21) or had previously been shown to cross-react with feline leukocytes (CD11a and CD49d) (Kaname et al., 2002) . For mAbs raised against human antigens with unknown feline cross-reactivity (CD15s and CD54), the tissue distribution and fluorescence patterns of the antigens recognized by these mAbs were determined in cat and were almost identical to those of humans indicating that the mAbs recognized the cat homologues of the human antigens. The optimal dilution of each Ab was determined prior to experiments and the same batches of Ab were used throughout the study. For details on antibodies see Table 2 .",

For each sample, a minimum of 10,000 events was acquired within the leukocyte gate. Forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC) were collected on a linear scale, while fluorescence was measured using a five decade logarithmic scale.

Next, leukocyte subpopulations were carefully delineated according to their light scatter characteristics and cell marker expression (Fig. 2) . The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in arbitrary units (linear conversion of log 10 fluorescence) was used as a relative indicator of the surface density of each adhesion molecule on the respective leukocyte population. These values were corrected by subtracting control fluorescence of the same subpopulation in which primary mAbs were substituted by irrelevant isotype matched mAbs.

Striking differences in FSC/SSC profiles of leukocytes from healthy and FIP cats were noted. The technique applied on blood of healthy subjects permitted to clearly define lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes based on their intrinsic forward and sideward light scattering characteristics. In contrast, these main leukocyte populations could not be identified simply by their FSC and SSC properties in FIP samples because of a considerable overlap between granulocytes and monocytes. Furthermore, a substantial diminution of the lymphocyte count in FIP cats made it difficult to separate this population from cell debris. Since gating of leukocyte populations based on physical characteristics could not be applied on FIP samples and to discriminate between B-and T-lymphocytes within the lymphocyte gate, specific cell markers were used to identify the different subpopulations in leukocytes from controls and patients. One color staining with anti-CD3 (Tlymphocytes) and anti-CD21 (B-lymphocytes) plotted against SSC and two color dot plots with anti-CD13 and antigranulocytes (monocytes and granulocytes) are shown in Fig. 2 . Finally, it was ascertained that the leukocyte preparation technique only rendered surface antigens and not intracellular antigens accessible for antibodies.

It is accepted today that the inflammatory reaction in FIP lesions is initiated by excessive leukocyte migration from the bloodstream into surrounding tissues (Kipar et al., 2005) . To date, adhesion molecules, which play a major role in leukocyte extravasation, have not been well characterized in FIPV infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative analysis of the quantitative expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules between normal and FIP cats using a whole blood flow cytometric assay. Currently, researchers are well aware that the expression of functionassociated antigens, like adhesion molecules, can be rapidly and artefactually modulated if cells are activated in vitro. This activation can readily occur during conventional cell preparation and labeling procedures (Forsyth and Levinsky, 1990; Macey et al., 1995) . To overcome these problems and to minimize ex vivo alterations, we have successfully applied the formaldehyde-based rapid leukocyte preparation technique, previously designed to prepare human leukocytes for this purpose (Hamblin et al., 1992) . In addition, it is well known that excessive formaldehyde fixation can cause permeation of the cell membrane (Macey and McCathy, 1993) . This would implicate that not only adhesion molecules expressed at the membrane surface but also intracellular storage pools of adhesion molecules become accessible for antibodies. Therefore it was first ascertained that the technique conserved the plasma membrane integrity, evidenced by a lack of cell staining with antibodies to the cytoplasmic antigen vimentin. Taken together, except for any possible changes due to the process of venipuncture itself, we believe that our findings represent the true state of the adhesion molecules on the surface of leukocytes from the circulating pools.",

The present study aimed to assess the expression of principal adhesion molecules involved in the leukocyte-endothelium interaction. We have demonstrated that the majority of adhesion molecules displayed an unimodal fluorescence distribution. Therefore changes in expression level (MFI), rather than distribution (% positive cells), appear to be an appropriate tool to determine whether there are alterations of expression associated with FIPV infection. The first step of extravasation, the characteristic leukocyte rolling phenomenon, is mediated by endothelial selectins that recognize sLex carbohydrate moieties on the terminal domains of glycoproteins on the leukocyte surface. Our results show considerable intersubject variation in the expression of sLex on all leukocyte populations. This wide biological range of sLex expression levels was not only seen in the patient group but also in the control group that was considered to be a relatively homogeneous group of young adult SPF cats. These findings are consistent with a study of Rebuck and Finn demonstrating that there is inherent variability in the expression of adhesion molecules (especially L-selectin) on granulocytes between and within healthy humans (Rebuck and Finn, 1994) . The second step in the adherence cascade involves firm attachment of leukocytes on the endothelium and is largely mediated by the interaction between integrins and members of the Ig supergene family. LFA-1 and Mac-1 are b 2 -integrins that promote the tight adherence of leukocytes to the endothelial ligand ICAM-1. LFA-1 is found on all leukocytes, whereas Mac-1 is only present on myeloid cells. In this study we demonstrate that granulocytes and monocytes of FIP cats display significantly more Mac-1 and circulating lymphocytes express higher densities of LFA-1 than control subjects. Increase in integrin expression is regulated by at least two mechanisms and can occur rapidly within minutes or gradually over a time course of 12-72 h. The rapid alterations are achieved by their mobilization from intracellular storage pools to the cell surface. In circulating granulocytes and monocytes, but not in lymphocytes, significant amounts of Mac-1 (CD11b/ CD18) are stored in intracellular vesicles, which upon cell activation are translocated within minutes to the membrane surface (Mazzone and Ricevuti, 1995) . This undoubtedly allows the rapid and prompt responsiveness of these cells during the development of the inflammatory process and might explain their predominance in inflammatory infiltrates in FIP (Takano et al., 2009a) . In addition to these rapid changes in cell-surface expression, quantitative alteration in integrin receptors can occur with longer stimulation (hours to days) and involves de novo integrin subunit synthesis. Lymphocyte adhesion relies greatly on LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18). Since little or no CD11a/CD18 is stored intracellularly, up regulation of these adhesion molecules depends on this second mechanism, which is a substantially slower process (Mazzone and Ricevuti, 1995) . These factors may underline the relatively slow lymphocyte responsiveness to activation, which in turn may be reflected in their later accumulation during the development of FIP lesions (Kipar et al., 1998) . Consistent with their original name (''very late antigens''), most leukocyte b 1 integrins increase their expression gradually after several days of activation. VLA-4 is unique among b 1 integrins in its ability to bind, in addition to matrix proteins, the endothelial ligand VCAM-1. The latter is a member of the Ig supergene family that resides on cytokine-activated endothelium (Carlos and Harlan, 1994) . Our results show that feline neutrophils, like their human counterparts, express relative low levels of VLA-4 confirming the prevailing view that VLA-4 plays a relatively minor role in neutrophil adhesion. In contrast, monocytes and lymphocytes express moderate to high levels of VLA-4 and its interaction with VCAM-1 has been proposed as an alternative emigration pathway for these cells. In our study, an increased expression of the a 4 subunit (CD49d) of VLA-4 on B-lymphocytes from FIP patients was demonstrated. This is consistent with the immuno-histochemical findings of Kipar et al. and Berg et al., who both examined the cellular composition of FIP lesions. They showed that in lesions without extended necrosis, B-cells and plasmacells progressively infiltrate granulomas, hence replacing macrophages and forming a broad outer rim (Berg et al., 2005; Kipar et al., 1998) . Since VLA-4 is critically involved in monocyte interaction with the endothelium, it was of interest that, despite this cell type predominates in FIP granuloma's, the expression levels of CD49d were significantly lower on monocytes from FIP patients compared with healthy controls. Meerschaert and Furie showed that monocyte adhesion on human EC monolayers was only inhibited completely when EC were preincubated with a combination of mAbs against the b 2 integrins and VLA-4 (Meerschaert and Furie, 1995) . These in vitro observations suggest that CD11/CD18 and VLA-4 represent alternative pathways for the transendothelial migration of monocytes. Given that the availability of at least one of these pathways is sufficient to support normal levels of migration, together with our findings, makes us assume that monocyte extravasation in FIP largely depends on b 2 integrin-ICAM-1 interaction. ICAM-1 is a member of the Ig supergene family member that is not only expressed on endothelial cells but also on lymphocytes and monocytes/ macrophages. It is well known that homotypic and heterotypic lymphocyte adhesion, mediated by interaction of ICAM-1 and CD11a,b/CD18, facilitates lymphocyte functions including antigen recognition, lymphocyte costimulation, and cytotoxicity. In addition, ICAM-1 has been shown to play an essential role in monocyte-lymphocyte communication (Hubbard and Rothlein, 2000) . Since the central role of ICAM-1 in the immune response, we explored the expression of this molecule in FIP. No differences were noted in the expression of ICAM-1 on lymphocytes and monocytes between patients and healthy controls. To date, published data on ICAM-1 expression on granulocytes is limited. Most recently, it was reported that human neutrophils do express ICAM-1 and it is up regulated by in vitro stimulation with endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. It was further speculated that up regulation of ICAM-1 may allow neutrophils to assist each other in reaching the final destination through their increased 'stickiness' via CD11a,b/CD18-ICAM-1 interaction (Wang et al., 1997) . Our flow cytometric analyses with the anti-CD54 monoclonal antibody demonstrated that feline granulocytes express moderate amounts of ICAM-1. The expression on granulocytes in the FIP group was characterized by a high variability between patients that might be responsible for the lack of significant difference with the control group. This variability might correlate with the stage of disease. However, this hypothesis could not be thoroughly assessed since in spontaneously occurring FIP it is not possible to determine the moment of infection nor to have an exhaustive follow-up, because cats were euthanatized just after blood sampling.",

            "text": "Higher expression of adhesion molecules in patients is consistent with the general activation of peripheral leukocytes. However, this study has not determined the mechanisms underlying the altered expression. Since only a small proportion of circulating monocytes are infected with FIPV, together with the findings that granulocytes and lymphocytes, which are not susceptible for FIPV infection, show similar expression changes than monocytes indicates that direct effect of viral infection itself does not account for observed alterations. It seems more likely that indirect effects, such as complex changes in the cytokine milieu associated with advancing FIP disease are causing these altered cell surface molecule density. A variety of cytokines has been shown to influence adhesion molecules expression. Mainly tumor necrosis factor TNF-a, interleukine (Il)-1, and interferon (IFN)-g have been implicated in the up regulation of integrins. Studies of cats with FIP have shown that cytokine expression is markedly altered as compared to healthy animals. Specifically it has been noted that the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, Il-1, and Il-6 are significantly increased in FIP, which very likely accounts for the activation of leukocytes in the circulation (Goitsuka et al., 1990; Kiss et al., 2004; Takano et al., 2009b) . An additional or alternative explanation for our findings may be a difference in relative immaturity of leukocytes in FIP cats. The rate of migration of cells from the bone marrow through the blood to tissues is likely to be faster in FIP patients than in normal cats, resulting in the accumulation of less mature cells in the circulation. FIP hematology is often characterized by a neutrophilia accompanied with an increased count of left shifted or less mature (''band'') neutrophils, providing evidence for an increased recruitment from the bone marrow. Differences in integrin expression are known to occur during leukocyte differentiation and altered surface levels may therefore reflect a different maturational level of cells in patients compared with controls (Elghetany, 2002; Kansas et al., 1990) . Changes in the composition of FIP peripheral lymphocytes may also underlie the increased level of CD11a/CD18 expression we have seen on these cells. It has been shown that T-lymphocytes undergo phenotypic changes upon encountering specific antigens and this conversion from na\u00efve to memory type involves increase of the level of expression of adhesion molecules (Sanders et al., 1988) .",

Whilst quantitative changes in expression have been associated with increased adhesion in vitro, it is recognized that adhesion in vivo can also occur without an increase in the level of surface expression. In fact, a body of data confirms that the regulation of the integrin-mediated adherence seems to be more complex than a pure quantitative change in expression of these molecules on the cell surface. It appears that under steady-state conditions integrin molecules on the cell surface are in a relatively low functional active state and upon activation of the leukocytes these molecules convert to an active state resulting in a higher affinity for their respective ligands. These qualitative changes are believed to be at least equally important than quantitative changes for in vivo activity of many adhesion molecules (Arnaout, 1990 ). We examined only the level of surface expression of adhesion molecules and the affinity state of these molecules was not determined. However, since their key role in leukocyte adherence, increase of the number of adhesion molecules expressed on the cell surface may predispose leukocytes to increased adhesion. Because adherence is generally accepted as being a rate-limiting step for transmigration to occur, relatively high adherence is followed by relatively high transmigration. Adherent and diapedesing leukocytes may release proteases, toxic oxygen metabolites, and vasoactive substances, together leading to endothelial injury with subsequent loss of vascular integrity, edema, and tissue injury contributing to the hallmark lesions of FIP.",

It is very likely that the priming of the blood leukocytes in FIP is one of the mechanisms behind the excessive recruitment and accumulation of immune cells resulting in granuloma formation and ultimately contributing indisputable to the pathogenesis of FIP disease. Our findings may provide reliable laboratory markers to support the ante mortem diagnosis of FIP which at present is still challenging. However, larger studies, including other pathological conditions, are warranted to evaluate the discriminating power of these parameters for FIP. In addition, detailed understanding of leukocyte interaction with vascular endothelial cells in FIP offers invaluable insights that could promote the emergence of novel therapeutic tools to interfere with leukocyte recruitment and subsequently limit tissue injury.",
