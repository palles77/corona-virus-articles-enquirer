In this survey, a total of 233 affected broiler chicken farms were sampled. The infectious bronchitis virus (alone) was detected with highest frequency in 60 farms, and separately or combined with other agents, in 110 farms; Newcastle disease virus, separately, was detected in 28 farms, and in 63 farms separately or combined with other infectious agents; and avian influenza H9N2 was detected in 22 farms separately and in 51 farms separately or concomitant with other infectious agents. The sample tested negative for all H5 serotypes. The results of the present study show that the most prevalent avian viral infectious disease contributing to respiratory syndromes in broiler farms in Iran was infectious bronchitis due to infectious bronchitis virus serotypes variant 2 and 793/B. On the other hand, combined with the alternation of dominant viruses and circulating strains, flocks are exposed to unremitting anamorphic viral infections. Thus, the permanent monitoring of cases that have occurred and the review of vaccination plans of affected flocks every year are some of the necessary measures needed for strategic control of respiratory syndrome in broilers. It is noteworthy that execution of epidemiologic examinations on the cogent factors of prevalence of this syndrome and defeat of vaccination strategy in the flocks is urgent and has to be fulfilled on the definite causes of time.",

The development of this industry has increased the density (concentration) of poultry farms in some parts of the country. Poultry farming ranging from extensive free range to intensive integrated production systems has provided conditions for the incidence of complex multifactorial infections such as bacterial, mycoplasma, and viral ones. In many cases, respiratory problems are due to infection with several infectious factors rather than with single one (Swayne et al. 2013) . Avian influenza (AI), Newcastle disease (ND), and infectious bronchitis (IB) are the major viral infections in broilers that present with respiratory signs.",

These infections occur either in the solitary form or in combination with multifactorial infections. Evidence indicates that most of these factors are synergistic and potentate themselves in infected flocks. In recent years, despite national and domestic prevention and control measures against AI, ND, and IB, coupled with widespread usage of diverse vaccines, outbreaks of these viral diseases still cause respiratory syndromes in broiler flocks resulting in high mortalities annually. Based on available statistics from the Iran Veterinary Organization (IVO), maximum economic damage in broiler flocks is related to losses arising from respiratory complications (Ebadzadeh et al. 2015) .",

Newcastle disease caused by avian paramyxovirus I (APMV-I) is also endemic in Asian and the Middle East countries. Co-infections in broiler flocks with AIV and NDV result in great economic losses due to severe morbidity and mortality rates. A third co-infection with IBV worsens the scenario.

Based on Iran Vet GIS, on an annual average, nearly 19,000 farms of the total 25,000 broiler farms are active with about four breeding periods in a year. The aggregation of broiler farms in the various provinces of Iran shows that the highest number is located in Mazandaran and Esfahan provinces. In addition, the number of breeding periods in these farms during each year is distinct on disparate zones (different areas of the country), so that it varies from three times in most central provinces with warm and dry climate up to five times in the northern provinces with moderate and wet climate, on average per year. The study population included all active (in production) broiler farms (based on Iran Vet GIS) that were infected with respiratory diseases as a new case during the study period. A farm infected with respiratory disease was defined as a flock with core clinical signs such as depression, snickering, sneezing, coughing, dyspnea, rattling, and nasal discharges with or without diarrhea or central nervous system signs (wing paralysis, legs paralysis, or twisted neck) that entailed rising mortality rates for at least 3 days.",

In an experiment relevant to Iraq during the years 2013-2014, 32 samples of IB virus were identified from 100 samples collected. This survey also identified variant 2 as the dominant virus (Seger In Egypt (Hassan et al. 2016) , infectious bronchitis alone and combined with other factors infected with respiratory diseases in 18.6% and 86%, respectively, has been pinpointed in 86 broiler chicken farms. Furthermore, the concomitant infection of bronchitis with avian influenza H9N2 was found to be the most common infection with 41.9% (Hassan et al. 2016) . After conclusive testing in Iran, the flocks of infected birds have been vaccinated against infectious bronchitis (Aghakhan et al. 1994) . However, the main challenge in control of IB is the circulation of variable genotypes of virus in different locations and in diverse time intervals. In addition, there is no vaccination available for establishing cross immunity among disparate exploited genotypes. Recently, a different vaccine of IB, containing H120 and 4/91, has been frequently used, but, notwithstanding this issue, again infectious bronchitis is being counted as a critical complication of broiler farms. Through complete fact-findings over the past years, it seems like the circulating serotypes were in morphism, with serotypes 793/B and variant 2 showing the most capacity and frequency on incidence of the disease (Ghalyanchi-Langeroudi et al. 2015) . The continuous observations of circulating viruses and using vaccines similar to these circulating strains, along with observation of health principles and biosecurity issues, are strategies that can be implemented for reduction of disease morbidity to infectious bronchitis. Apart from infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease has also had a momentous role in the incidence of respiratory syndromes in the country's broiler farms. Velogenic ND is endemic in Iran and in spite of widespread vaccination, every year, there are outbreaks of Newcastle disease nationwide (Hosseini et al. 2014) . In this study, infectious bronchitis, avian influenza, and Newcastle disease were detected in 27% of the broiler farms surveyed. Recently, distinctive analyses have allowed researchers to understand the active Newcastle disease virus genotype variants in the nation (Hosseini et al. 2014; Mayahi and Esmaelizad 2017; Mehrabanpour et al. 2014; Sabouri et al. 2017) . The above-mentioned probes indicate that, despite huge vaccination drives against the disease in broiler farms, we still witness sporadic occurrence of this disease in the country.",

Furthermore, the roles of H9N2 influenza and velogenic Newcastle viruses in the outbreak of respiratory syndromes are distinct, while their simultaneous infection is the cause of virulence in the farms. On the other hand, due to arguments of distinct strains, combined with alternation of dominant viruses, the serotypes, genotypes, and circulation of strains between viruses are also exposed to unremitting anamorphic conditions. Thus, necessary measures for strategic control of this process include permanent monitoring of respiratory syndrome cases that have occurred as well as the review of vaccination plans for affected flocks in each year. It is recommended that epidemiologic studies should be conducted frequently on risk factors of prevalence of these diseases and effectiveness of vaccination strategy in the flocks.",
