Both of these negative-stranded RNA viruses utilize sialic acids on the cell surface as a receptor, allowing them to target same cells. However, their biological properties are quite different. The IAV genome Abstract It has been reported that dual or multiple viruses can coinfect epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. However, little has been reported on in vitro interactions of coinfected viruses. To explore how coinfection of different viruses affects their biological property, we examined growth of influenza A virus (IAV) and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) during coinfection of Vero cells. We found that IAV growth was enhanced by coinfection with hPIV2. The enhanced growth of IAV was not reproduced by coinfection with an hPIV2 mutant with reduced cell fusion activity, or by ectopic expression of the V protein of hPIV2. In contrast, induction of cell fusion by ectopic expression of the hPIV2 HN and F proteins augments IAV growth. hPIV2 coinfection supported IAV growth in cells originated from the respiratory epithelium. The enhancement correlated closely with cell fusion ability of hPIV2 in those cells. These results indicate that cell fusion induced by hPIV2 infection is beneficial to IAV replication and that enhanced viral replication by coinfection with different viruses can modify their pathological consequences.",

Since many of these respiratory viruses co-circulate around the same time, often in winter, there is an increasing possibility that dual or multiple viruses coinfect a single host [1] . Indeed, incidents of coinfection with multiple viruses were detected using multi-target analysis such as multiplex PCR or nextgeneration sequencing [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Several studies indicate that coinfection is not associated with disease outcome [5, [8] [9] [10] , while others indicate increase of disease severity [11] [12] [13] . Thus, pathological relevance of coinfection is unclear.",

Both viruses carry a system to evade host antiviral responses. The non-structural (NS1) protein of IAV has been reported to limit interferon (IFN) production by blocking the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)/interferon-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) signaling pathway [17] . Also it blocks the function of IFN-induced proteins, such as 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase and the dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase R [18] [19] [20] [21] . The counterpart of hPIV2 is the V protein. The V protein inhibits IFN production by binding to RIG-I like receptors, the melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) [22, 23] . The V protein also acts as an alternative substrate for inhibitor of kappa B kinase epsilon and TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa-B activator binding kinase 1 leading to inhibition of the interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF) 3 activation [24] . The V protein also inhibits Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7-and TLR 9-dependent signaling by interaction with the IRF 7 and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) [25] . In addition, the V protein suppresses expression of the interferon inducible genes by degradation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) protein [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

Since some of the targets of V protein are involved in an IFN-independent innate antiviral response [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] , V may have some relevance to accelerated replication of IAV irrespective of inhibition of type I IFN expression. To test this possibility, we established Vero cells constitutively expressing the hPIV2 V protein (Vero-V) using the episomal Epstein-Barr virus-based expression system (Fig. 3a) . Since pEBS-V was maintained in transfected cells as an episome, we eliminated untransfected cells using hygromycin B, and resistant cells were pooled as Vero-V cells. Vero-E control cells were generated by introduction of an empty plasmid. IFA of the Vero-V cells showed that, except for a small population, the majority of cells expressed the V protein, which localized predominantly in the nuclei as reported previously (Fig. 3a ) [26, 43] . The functionality of expressed V protein was confirmed by STAT2 degradation in the Vero-V cells (Fig. 3b) . The growth property of IAV was studied in three pools of Vero-V and Vero-E cells, which were established by independent transfections. V protein expression did not enhance the propagation of IAV in the three experiments (Fig. 3c) , suggesting that V was not involved in the enhanced propagation of IAV during coinfection with hPIV2.",

The cell fusion activity of hPIV2 in H358 cells was apparently weak in comparison with that in Vero cells (Figs. 2a, panel e, 5 , panel k). To maximize cell fusion effect in IAV production, we infected IAV at an MOI of 1 and incubated the infected cell without trypsin. Coinfection of hPIV2 decreased IAV production in A549 cells, but did not decrease in H358 cell ( Table 1 ), indicating that coinfection with wt hPIV2 tended to support IAV production in H358 cells. To confirm the IAV productivity by hPIV2 coinfection was relevant to cell fusion, the reduced fusogenic-mutant virus, H-83/186, was used for coinfection with IAV as shown in Fig. 2b .

Thus, the growth of IAV by coinfection with hPIV2 might be maintained under conditions that generally do not support IAV propagation. To test this hypothesis, we performed two experiments. First, Vero cells coinfected with IAV and hPIV2 were incubated in the absence of trypsin, which confers infectivity of progeny virus by cleavage of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) [44, 45] . Second, ammonium chloride, which suppresses influenza virus entering the cytoplasm by inhibition of endosomal acidification [46] [47] [48] , was added to culture medium at 3 h after infection. Neither treatment affected cell fusion and virus growth by hPIV2 infection (Fig. 6a,  b) . Under those conditions, the growth of IAV declined from 48-72 h in Vero cells infected with IAV alone, indicating that the treatments inhibited multiple rounds of IAV replication. Despite these same conditions, IAV continued to propagate when Vero cells were coinfected with hPIV2 (Fig. 6c).   Fig. 4 Cell fusion is sufficient for enhanced growth of IAV. Vero cells were transfected with plasmids for expression of the hPIV2 HN and F proteins and then infected with IAV at an MOI of 0.01. a hPIV2 proteins expression (green) and IAV infection (red) were detected at 48 h after infection by IFA. b Virus titers at 48 h after infection were measured by plaque assay.

IAV growth reached a plateau at 48 h after infection in Vero cells (Fig. 1b) , as the number of infected cells increased very little from 48 to 72 h after infection even though uninfected cells still existed (Fig. 2a, panels  k, l) . The inefficient spread of IAV in Vero cells limits the growth of IAV. When IAV was coinfected with hPIV2, hPIV2 induced extensive syncytia which incorporated the IAV-infected cells (Fig. 2a) . Our results indicate that IAV could expand the infection due to cell fusion independently of infection by progeny viruses. It seems that formation of the IAV-infected syncytia overcame inefficient spread of IAV in Vero cells. This conclusion is supported by the fact that coinfection with the limited fusogenic H-83/186 hPIV2-mutant virus did not enhance the IAV growth (Fig. 2b) and that induction of cell fusion by the HN and F expression increased IAV production (Fig. 4b) .",

As A549 and H358 cells are carcinoma cell lines originated from human respiratory epithelium and frequently used as in vitro model of the respiratory infection for IAV, we used these cells for coinfection experiments. Coinfection of hPIV2 resulted in limited cell fusion in H358 cells and IAV production was increased slightly. IAV cannot undergo multiple rounds of infection in cells incubated without trypsin. The slight increase in IAV production is presumably due to cell fusion induced by hPIV2. Indeed, the propagation of IAV was not impacted in A549 cells coinfected with wt hPIV2 and H358 cells coinfected with H-83/136 hPIV2-mutant virus, both of which lacked cell fusion. Thus, these results also support a hypothesis that IAV production correlates with cell fusion induced by hPIV2. Although these results suggest that cell fusion by hPIV2 infection supports IAV growth in the respiratory epithelium, further studies, such as the use of human primary airway epithelial cells, are essential to detailed evaluation of its significance.

Therefore, the cytopathogenicity of IAV is predicted as a major cause of growth suppression of RSV. In contrast, it seems that hPIV2 replication was not suppressed because IAV infection showed little cytopathic effect in Vero cells (Fig. 2a) . This prediction is supported by our preliminary experiment, in which growth of hPIV2 with IAV coinfection was reduced to 1/10-1/30 of that of hPIV2 infection alone in MDCK cells (data not shown).",

These findings raise the possibility that the V protein counteracts the cellular antiviral system even in type I IFN gene-deficient Vero cells [50] . Thus, we examined whether the V protein of hPIV2 had an impact on intracellular replication of IAV in IAV and hPIV2-coinfected Vero cells. We established Vero cells constitutively expressing the hPIV2 V protein and showed that the localization of the V protein was predominantly intranuclear in Vero-V cells (Fig. 3a) . Our results indicated that the expression of V protein alone did not enhance IAV growth, suggesting that the antiviral factors are unlikely to be involved in IAV replication. In addition, the intranuclear V protein conceivably has no effect on IAV genome replication. Although the functionality of the expressed V protein was confirmed by degradation of STAT2 protein, these results may be misleading. Our results agreed with the previous report indicating intranuclear localization of the V protein in the V protein-expressing cells [26, 43] . The V protein, however, exhibited not only intranuclear distribution but also distribution throughout the cytoplasm in hPIV2-infected cells [51] . Thus, the V protein in Vero-V cells may not be functionally equivalent to that in hPIV2-infected cells. Indeed, V protein expression in our cells does not complement impaired replication of a mutant hPIV2 due to amino acid substitutions in the V protein [52] . Accordingly, there is still a possibility that the V protein supports the enhanced IAV growth in coinfected cells.",

            "text": "The distinct growth properties of IAV during hPIV2 coinfection were clearly demonstrated by infections in the absence of trypsin or in the presence of ammonium chloride. To acquire infectivity of IAVs, the HA protein must be activated by trypsin cleavage at a specific site. Ammonium chloride inhibits acidification of endosomes where a low-pH-dependent conformational change in the HA protein triggers fusion of the virus envelope with the endosomal membrane [46] . Thus, in either condition multiple rounds of IAV replication are suppressed. We found that the titer of IAV decreased after 48 h after infection in the case of single infection (Fig. 5c) . However, IAV continued to grow under these conditions when hPIV2 was coinfected. The distinct growth of IAV is presumed to be largely attributable to cell fusion induced by hPIV2. As discussed above IAV could expand the extent of infection by the cell fusion independently of infection by progeny viruses. Therefore, syncytium formation could confer expanded region of virus production to IAV regardless of culture condition. From this perspective, viruses with the ability to induce syncytium formation, such as RSV and mumps virus, may support IAV propagation as seen in this study. Fig. 6 Cell fusion enables IAV to grow in the condition that generally inhibits propagation of IAV. After virus adsorption, the cells were incubated either in the absence of trypsin or in the presence of ammonium chloride (AmCl). a The extent of cell fusion under those conditions was observed by microscopy. b hPIV2 titers at each time points were measured by TCID 50 assay in Vero cells. Open triangle IAV and hPIV2 coinfection, filled circle hPIV2 single infection. c IAV titers at each time points were measured by plaque assay in MDCK cells, Open diamond IAV and hPIV2 coinfection, filled circle IAV single infection. b, c The data are shown as mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). *P < 0.01, according to the Student's t test Our results suggest that a virus can acquire additional properties when other viruses are present in the same tissue. Since multiple virus infections, especially in respiratory and intestinal tracts, are not uncommon, virus-virus interaction may well be an important determinant of pathological consequences. Therefore, in addition to conventional analyses that focus on a single virus infection, an analysis of coinfection by dual or multiple viruses should be conducted.",
