For other virus families like the picornaviruses it is known that pathology is related to proteolytic cleavage of host proteins by viral proteinases. Furthermore, several studies indicate that virus proliferation can be arrested using specific proteinase inhibitors supporting the belief that proteinases are indeed important during infection. Prompted by this, we set out to analyse and predict cleavage by the coronavirus main proteinase using computational methods.",

Currently, seven coronavirus genomes, including SARS coronavirus (CoV), have been fully sequenced and cluster into four main groups, of which SARS-CoV occupies its own [2, 3] . Polyproteins encoded by the coronavirus RNA are processed by viral proteinases yielding mature proteins. The main proteinase 3CL pro performs at least eleven proteolytic cleavages within a single viral polyprotein [4, 5] . Viral polyprotein processing is a common theme in viral molecular biology, e.g. as seen in picornaviruses and retroviruses like HIV.

Earlier, we developed a computational approach for predicting potential cleavage sites of picornavirus proteinases 2A and 3C [10] . Badorff et al. successfully used this cleavage predictor to identify the cellular target dystrophin, which they experimentally showed to be cleaved both in vitro and in vivo [11] . However, preliminary studies revealed that this model is not compatible with coronavirus cleavage sites. The general approach is still valid though, and we decided to apply this method to the problem of predicting the 3CL pro proteinase cleavage sites and identifying potential host cell target proteins. We propose that a deeper understanding of coronavirus proteinase function and substrate specificity may benefit further research by: i) increasing the understanding of substrate specificity determinants which may direct studies focusing on the development of specific proteinase inhibitors and ii) providing a method for screening cellular target proteins for potential coronavirus proteinase cleavage sites.",

Every site had a glutamine (Q) in position P1 (the position just before the cleavage site; the positions are named as suggested by Berger and Schechter [13] with P1, P2, ... etc., N-terminal to the cleavage site and P1', P2', ... etc., C-terminal to the cleavage site). From the sequence logo ( Figure 1 ) a very strong consensus is evident around the cleavage site. As discussed by others [14, 15] , the coronavirus 3C-like proteinase shares many traits with its picornavirus 3C proteinase counterpart, hence the name. This is reflected in the cleavage site logo although differences between the two are also apparent. Positions P1', P1, and P4 have similar amino acid distribution in the 3C and 3CL proteinase cleavage sites. On the other hand, the coronavirus proteinase has a strong preference for leucine at position P2 while this position is relatively non-conserved among picornavirus proteinase cleavage sites [10] . A recently published study of the crystal structure of 3CL pro from the 229E strain of human coronaviruses indicates that residues at positions P5 to P3 form an anti-parallel \u03b2 sheet with part of the proteinase, signifying their importance in cleavage site recognition [7] .",

However, an additional 196 sites in the viral polyproteins are incorrectly classified as cleavage sites, being random occurrences of this pair of amino acids. Classification is improved by using the consensus pattern 'LQ [S/A]', meaning Leu-Gln-(Ser OR Ala), but it is still far from being a useful classifier. The false positive rate is now down to 36 wrong sites, but at the same time only 48 (62%) of the correct cleavage sites are detected. As the pattern becomes more sophisticated, specificity increases (reducing the number of false positives) but at the same time sensitivity drops dramatically (i.e. fewer of the true sites are detected).",

The best model was obtained using a threelayered neural network with two hidden neurons and a sequence window encompassing nine amino acids centered on the P1 position, thus encompassing P5-P4'. The network evaluates and assigns a score between 0 and 1 to every glutamine to which it is presented, where a score above 0.5 is considered a positive answer (i.e. a cleavage site is predicted). This model was able to classify correctly 67 of 77 known cleavage sites (87.0%) and 1,358 of 1,372 (99.0%) sites assumed not to be cleaved by the proteinase when testing on independent sites not included when training. The neural network method could thus identify many more of the positive sites with fewer false positives than simple consensus-type methods thereby increasing the classification performance. To evaluate the predictive power of the neural network, we performed a basic bayesian analysis of the data set test results. The scoring range from 0 to 1 was divided into ten bins and the posterior probability of a positive prediction (a prediction indicating a cleavage) being true was calculated and plotted ( Figure 3 ). The posterior probability in the range 0.5 to 0.8 cannot be determined accurately since relatively few examples score in this interval -only 3% of the test set (both positive and negative examples) scores between 0.4 and 0.8. However, results indicate that prediction scores can be classified into three categories, those that fall below 0.5 are most likely not cleaved, those that fall between 0.5 and 0.8 are possibly cleaved and those above 0.8 are most likely cleaved if available to the proteinase.",

RNA polymerase (RPC1_HUMAN) has a predicted cleavage site after Glnl95 with a score (0.765) well above the 0.5 cut-off. The protein is the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase III complex and if this protein is indeed a cellular proteinase target it might cause disruption of the RNA polymerase III complex upon infection with a coronavirus. A similar disruption would be expected in case of a cleavage of the largest subunit of the complex (RPA1_HUMAN) which also has a predicted cleavage site (at position 329, score 0.704). It agrees with findings that poliovirus disrupts RNA polymerase III function, although this occurs through cleavage of transcription factor IIIC and not the polymerase subunits themselves [18] [19] [20] . Several well-known transcription factors contain potential cleavage sites. The highest scoring is CREB-RP (AT6B_HUMAN) with a predicted cleavage site at Gln358 (0.916) close to the DNA binding leucine zipper motif. This is in agreement with findings from picornavirus 3C pro proteinase although at a different position in the sequence [21] . OCT-1 (PO21_HUMAN) is also predicted to be cleaved by the 3CL pro proteinase with high confidence (0.874) following Gln62 again corresponding to experimental evidence from picornavirus [22] . Several subunits of the transcription initiation factor TFIID, which is a verified target in poliovirus infections [23] , have predicted cleavage sites; the 250 kDa subunit (T2D1_HUMAN), the 135 kDa subunit (T2D3_HUMAN), and the 105 kDa subunit (T2DT_HUMAN).",
