Two patients had symptoms of cough. fever. and malaise. following completion of a course of combination chemotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The third patient. a juvenile onset diabetic. developed similar symptoms while hospitalized for severe hyperglycemia. Chest roentgenograms showed lower lobe infiltrates in both leukemic patients and a bilateral non-confluent bronchopneumonia in the diabetic patient. All patients had a marked rise in complement-fixing antibodytitresto RSV. suggesting a concurrent infection with the virus. Extensive microbiological investigations failed to reveal any other etiologic agent. Nosocomial infection was considered possible. RSV is not considered a cause of pneumonia in compromised adults. Our three cases suggest that there may be a higher incidence of RSV pneumonia in compromised patients. than previously recognized. [Am J Med Sci 1983; 285(3):28-33.] Bronchopneumonia",

Serum neutralizing antibodies lessen the severity of pneumonia caused by RSV, but they do not prevent the occurrence of the disease. 22 Interferon does not appear to playa major role in protection from RSV disease 23 and the contribution of specific secretory IgA antibody is, as yet, undefined. 24 A specific cellmediated immune response (eMI) develops following natural infection with RSV/ 5 ,26 but its role in the pathogenesis of RSV infection is controversial. Scott and co-workers 26 found that RSV infection resulted in an exaggerated eM I response in children less than six months of age, and proposed that cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions might contribute to the increased sensitivity to the virus observed within this age group. In contrast, other investigators have demonstrated RSV specific eMI reactivity in healthy adults and older children, but not in infants or samples of cord blood. 27 The latter observation would suggest that a lack of effective eMI might contribute to the severity of RSV disease in younger patients. The major immune defect in our patients was probably a depression of eM!.",

Both leukemic patients were occupants of the same ward, and RSV infection was serodiagnosed in 2 additional patients with mild upper respiratory tract illness on the ward.
