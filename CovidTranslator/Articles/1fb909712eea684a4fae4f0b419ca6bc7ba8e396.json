We further identified that modification of primary amines to secondary and tertiary amines using the small molecule imidazole-aceticacid (IAA) ameliorates in vivo toxicity from both nanocarriers by different, material-specific mechanisms related to Toll-like receptor 4 activation (for bPEI) and complement activation driven neutrophil infiltration (for chitosan), respectively.

[1, 2] To form nanoparticles, anionic nucleic acids are often complexed with cationic polymers or cationic lipids -a process that results in nanoparticles with efficient nucleic acid loading and favorable physical characteristics for intracellular delivery of the cargo in vitro. [3] , [4] Despite several desirable attributes, cationic nanoparticles induce significant in vivo toxicity, especially when delivered systemically, which has prevented their clinical translation even after decades of research. For lipid-based particles, toxicity profiles have been improved by using ionizable and neutral lipids with other excipients. In fact, most current clinical trials for systemic delivery using nanoparticles use lipid-based particles. [5] [6] [7] Meanwhile, a whole class of materials (cationic polymers), despite demonstrating promising in vitro efficacy results for decades, has not advanced into the clinic. In some cases nanoparticles consisting of modified cyclodextrin or protamine were evaluated in Phase I clinical trials, but further studies were not pursued. [8, 9] An ideal nucleic acid delivery agent must ensure a balance between low toxicity and high therapeutic efficacy in vivo -two attributes that have been difficult to achieve simultaneously using cationic polymer nanoparticles. [10] Chemists and material scientists have empirically optimized physicochemical properties (e.g. size, surface functional groups, charge) to improve nanoparticle safety and transfection efficiency [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] These studies identified formulations with lower in vitro toxicity, and in some cases, the potential for in vivo efficacy in animal models, but detailed studies on the relationship between nanoparticle design and mechanisms of in vivo systemic toxicity have been scarce or very limited in scope. [18] A widely studied modification to reduce systemic toxicity of nanoparticles is the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the formulations. A major drawback of PEG-modified formulations, however, is that anti-PEG antibodies can be generated, which activate the complement cascade and further decrease therapeutic efficacy. [19] [20] [21] [22] This shortcoming of PEG, which could not be predicted in vitro, highlight the importance of studies that investigate the detailed in vivo mechanisms by which nanoparticles induce systemic toxicity.",

It is also critical to understand how they distribute to organs and in specific cell-types to trigger the innate immune response. In this study, we identify the distinct contributors to the in vivo toxicity responses induced by two widely-reported cationic nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery -branched polyethyleneimine (bPEI) and chitosan. We found that the mechanism of in vivo systemic toxicity is a combination of innate immune responses, complement reactions, and hepatic and hematological toxicities -and the relative contribution of these differs with the type of polymer. We then compared in vivo systemic toxicity to these nanoparticles after modification with the small molecule imidazole-acetic-acid (IAA), which modifies primary-amines on the polymers and introduces secondary and tertiary amines. We hypothesized that such modification would reduce innate immune activation by downregulating interactions with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). While we observed reduced TLR4-mediated systemic toxicity with the IAA-modified nanoparticles, we also observe a significant impact on other measures of the systemic toxicity response -which include in vivo hepatotoxicity, complement activation, and changes in hematological properties.",

Each nanoparticle formulation was synthesized through an ionic gelation process with sodium tripolyphosphate (unmodified bPEI nanoparticles = bPEI-TPP, IAA-modified bPEI nanoparticles = bPEI-IAA-TPP, unmodified chitosan nanoparticles = Ch-TPP, IAA-modified chitosan nanoparticles = Ch-IAA-TPP; Fig. 1B ). [24] Both PEI and chitosan have been reported to activate TLR4 in macrophages, leading to the secretion of IL-12, nitric oxide, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a). [25] [26] [27] In addition, chitosan triggers DNA release from mitochondria in vitro, which results in stimulator-of-interferon-gene (STING) pathway-mediated upregulation of antiviral signaling through production of interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. [28] We hypothesized that these innate immune reactions could be reduced by modification of the primary amines in these polymers to secondary and tertiary amines -which could, at the same time preserve or enhance their buffering capacity and thus delivery efficacy. To achieve this, we conjugated IAA to bPEI or chitosan using a carbodiimide chemistry (Fig. 1C ). [11] Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), we determined that 12% of available reaction sites on the bPEI polymer were modified with IAA ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ). Nanoparticles composed of unmodified or IAA-modified bPEI were slightly less than 100 nm in size ( Supplementary Fig. 1B ). Both unmodified and IAA-modified bPEI nanoparticles had a similar, slightly negative zeta potential (~-10 mV) at pH 7.4. To quantify IAA modification of chitosan, we measured absorbance by spectrophotometry at 230 nm (Supplementary Fig. 2A ).",

This inspired us to evaluate if cationic nanoparticles influence blood properties after IV injection. 30 minutes after mice were treated with unmodified bPEI nanoparticles, hematocrit rose from 40% to 80%. At the same time point, hemoglobin concentration rose from 12 to 25 g/dL. In contrast, no changes in hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration were observed in IAA-modified bPEI nanoparticle-treated mice after 30 minutes (Fig. 3F-G) . Both unmodified and IAA-modified bPEI nanoparticles increased the neutrophil fraction in white blood cells from 0 to 15% after 30 minutes. This neutrophil fraction remained high with mice treated with unmodified bPEI nanoparticles after 150 minutes, but returned to baseline in mice treated with IAA-modified bPEI nanoparticles (Fig. 3H) . The increase in hematocrit prompted us to evaluate if the unmodified bPEI nanoparticles were initiating a coagulation cascade by hemolyzing red blood cells, which can induce adenosine diphosphate release and subsequently activate platelets. [30] Neither bPEI nanoparticle formulation induced a significant amount of hemolysis when incubated with whole blood at a concentration of 125 \u00b5g/mL, which is twice as high as the blood pool concentration of bPEI nanoparticles immediately after IV injection in our experiments (60 \u00b5g/mL; Supplementary Fig. 4B ).

Finally, we assessed the role of TLR4 activation on in vivo toxicity by measuring the immune response to bPEI nanoparticles in TLR4 knockout mice. No measurable IL-6 production was measured in the sera of TLR4 knockout mice after 1 hour ( Supplementary Fig. 4D ), but ALT levels were still elevated ( Supplementary Fig. 4E ).

The PD-L1 gene was targeted in B16-F10 melanoma cells, which is an intriguing therapeutic target that could potentially reduce tumor-related immune suppression. [32] PD-L1 was first induced in melanoma cells through treatment with interferon-g at a concentration of 50 ng/mL. Treatment of PD-L1-induced cells with unmodified bPEI or chitosan nanoparticles yielded two observations. First, nanoparticles with PD-L1 target siRNA could reduce PD-L1 gene expression relative to nanoparticles with negative control siRNA. Second, unmodified bPEI and chitosan nanoparticles with negative control siRNA upregulated PD-L1 expression over PD-L1induced cells without nanoparticles. IAA-modified nanoparticles with negative control siRNA, on the other hand, did not upregulate PD-L1 expression. Since PD-L1 can be upregulated in response to TLR4 activation, these data further support that IAA modification reduces the inflammatory response to cationic nanoparticles ( Supplementary Fig. 9A-D) . [33] We also evaluated if bPEI nanoparticles could deliver functional luciferase mRNA (mLuc). First, we delivered mLuc with bPEI nanoparticles to HELA cells and measured luminescence from cell lysates after 5 hours. Normalized luminescence signal from IAAmodified bPEI nanoparticle-treated cells with mLuc was four times higher than from cells treated with unmodified bPEI nanoparticles with mLuc ( Supplementary Fig. 10A ). Following this study, we evaluated if IAA-modified bPEI nanoparticles could deliver functional mLuc in vivo. Three hours after IV delivery of luciferase mRNA, we observed a 20-fold increase in BLI signal in the lungs relative to untreated mice. This level of BLI signal remained high after 6 hours ( Supplementary Fig. 10B ). The equivalent dose of unmodified bPEI nanoparticles caused severe acute toxicity within 30 minutes, so luciferase expression was not measured.",

At the same time, IAA modification also increased neutrophil uptake of chitosan nanoparticles and in vivo complement activation. This seems paradoxical, given that complement activation is typically considered pro-inflammatory. Complement fragments, however, have been shown to enhance the anti-inflammatory activity of neutrophil extracellular traps on TLR4-activated macrophages. [47] , [48] Evidence of enhanced neutrophil uptake, heightened complement activation, and reduced IL-6 enable this to be a plausible mechanism for the reduced in vivo systemic toxicity of IAA-modified chitosan. This complex phenomenon between multiple cell types could explain the disparity between our in vivo and in vitro toxicity results with chitosanwhere IAA-modified chitosan nanoparticles induced a strong innate immune response from BMDCs.

The contributions of each biological phenomenon to cationic nanomaterial toxicity is different for different materials -for bPEI, toxicity profile is driven by liver toxicity and changes in hematology; while for chitosan, the toxicity profile is governed by a balance of TLR and complement activation. The classification of what makes a \"safe nanoparticle\" must be determined by a weighted consideration of each of these in vivo biological phenomena. We also conclude that chemical modifications do not affect toxicity in the same manner when applied to different polymers. Our results also show that in vitro measures of the innate immune response, as with the example of IAA-modified chitosan, do not accurately predict in vivo toxicity. Therefore, it is essential to move beyond in vitro cytotoxicity screens for nanomaterials to more informative, and detailed in vivo toxicity tests to appropriately select nanoparticle candidates for clinical nucleic acid delivery.",
