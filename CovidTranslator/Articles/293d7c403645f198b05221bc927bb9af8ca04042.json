When the polypeptide specificity recognized by these monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was investigated by Western immunoblotting, all of the MAbs reacted with peplomer glycoprotein (S) of the virus. By competitive binding assay these MAbs were found to recognize at least 3 different epitopes. The reactivity of these MAbs with 6 viruses classified as FIPV type I (UCD-1, UCD-2, UCD-3, UCD-4, NW-1, and Black), feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) type II strain 79-1683, canine coronavirus (CCV) strain 1-71, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains TO-163 and SH was examined by neutralization tests. All MAbs neutralized FECV strain 79-1683, CCV strain 1-71, and TGEV strains TO-163 and SH, while they did not neutralize the 6 FIPV type I viruses. Moreover, the MAb against TGEV strain TO-163, which has strong neutralizing activity against 7 TGEV viruses, neutralized CCV strain 1-71, FECV strain 79-1683, and FIPV strain 79-1146, but did not neutralize the 6 FIPV type I viruses.",

Among these types, FIPV type II and FECV type II are reported to be antigenicatly closer to TGEV and CCV. Between TGEV Purdue strain and FIPV 79-1146 strain a high degree of homology in the primary structure of the peplomer protein (S, 210k) has been described (39% for amino acid residues 1 to 274 and 93% for residues 275 to 1447) [9] . The authors prepared MAbs which react only with the feline coronaviruses FIPV type II strain 79-1146 and FECV type II strain 79-1683. Some of these MAbs reacted with either TGEV or CCV in indirect fluorescent antibody assays. Also, some differences in antigenically between FIPV type I virus strains were noted in an analysis using MAbs (unpubl. obs.).",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that epitopes associated with neutralization are present on the S protein of viruses. Fiscus and Teramoto have reported this phenomenon in feline coronaviruses I-3]. All 7 MAbs with neutralizing activity were observed to recognize S protein. This finding confirms the presence of a neutralizing epitope on the S protein. However, there have been no reports on the characteristics of this epitope. The results of the competitive binding assay using the 7 MAbs revealed the existence of at least 3 different neutralizing epitopes (I, II, and III) in FIPV strain 79-1146 (Table 3) . We believe that the topographical relationship between epitopes I, II, and III is as follows. Since (Fig. 2 a) resulting in blocking by steric hindrance, or that epitope III overlaps part of epitopes I and II (Fig. 2 b) . Differences in the epitopes recognized by the 7 MAbs were determined. The NT activity of these 7 MAbs against several feline, porcine, and canine coronaviruses was examined. These MAbs did not neutralize the 6 FIPV type I viruses, but neutralized FECV strain 79-1683, TGEV strains TO-163 and SH, and CCV strain 1-71, which do not cause feline infectious peritonitis (Table 4) . Moreover, a MAb against TGEV strain TO-163, which neutralized the 7 TGEV strains, neutralized FIPV strain 79-1146, FECV strain 79-1683, and CCV strain 1-71 (Table 5 ). These results support the classification by Pedersen et al. [ 17] . When the 5 virus groups (FIPV type I, FIPV type II, FECV type II, TGEV, and CCV) are serologicalty compared, FIPV type Ii, FECV type II, TGEV, and CCV are found to form a group. FIPV type I virus seems to be a virus of a distinct serotype. In other words, FIPV inducing feline infectious peritonitis seem to consist of viruses of at least 2 serotypes. Pedersen etal. [17] have indicated that many cases of feline infectious peritonitis in cats are induced by type I virus infection. We also found that, out of 24 cats with feline infectious peritonitis-like symptoms and antibody-positive by indirect fluorescent antibody assay, only 6 were positive for neutralizing antibody against FIPV strain 79-1146 (FIPV type II) (unpubl. data). It is probable that FIPV type I is more prevalent in a natural environment. In the future, examination of the effects of different virus types on the anitbody-mediated enhancement of FIPV infection [15, 26] , as seen in dengue virus infection [5, 13] , would be valuable. At present, we are investigating the effects of the neutralizing MAb prepared in this study against in vivo FIPV infection. Differences between TGEV strain Purdue and FIPV type II strain 79-1146 at the gene level of S protein have been reported [9] . Analysis of FIPV type I at the gene level is also desired. ",

All these 3 MAbs recognize different epitopes of the S protein of TGEV. Among these MAbs, MAb 55-2 possesses a strong neutralizing activity 1:12,800 -,~ 1:40,960) against 7 TGEV strains (TO-163, h-5, Kanagawa, Purdue, Ukiha, SH, Miller strains), and similarly, MAb 38-A has a weak neutralizing activity (1:8~ 1:640) against the 7 TGEV strains. MAb 66-A possesses a neutralizing activity only against the TO-163, h-5 and Kanagawa strains of TGEV.",

In contrast, 2 MAbs which recognize epitope III were inhibited by all unlabeled MAb. Moreover, the unlabeled MAb of epitope III inhibited the labeled MAbs of epitopes I and II by 34.1~ 76.4%. Consequently, it was postulated that epitope III exists at an intermediate site between epitopes I and II, very close to both epitopes",
