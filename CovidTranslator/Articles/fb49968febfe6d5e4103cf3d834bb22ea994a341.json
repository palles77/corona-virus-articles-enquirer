According to the hydropathy profile of amino acids, a protein sequence is taken as a string with three letters. Three curves of the new protein sequence were defined to describe the protein sequence. A new method to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequence was proposed based on the conditional probability of the protein sequence. Finally, the protein sequences of ND6 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6) protein of eight species were taken as an example to illustrate the new approach. The results demonstrated that the method is convenient and efficient.",

            "text": "Sequence alignment is based on computeroriented and computer-intensive comparisons of sequences, and then a distance function or a score function is obtained. Using the distance function, one can compare biological sequences. However, multiple sequence alignment of several hundred sequences always produces a bottleneck, firstly due to long computational time, and secondly due to possible bias of multiple sequence alignments for multiple occurrences of highly similar sequences (Pham and Zuegg, 2004) . Therefore, the emergence of a study on alignment-free sequence analysis is obvious. Until now, alignment-free sequence analysis is still in its early development. For most alignment-free methods, a biological sequence should be transformed into an object for which a linear algebra and statistical theory already has useful analytical tools. Since 1983, DNA sequence has been represented in different dimension spaces (Hamori and Ruskin, 1983; Hamori, 1985; Nandy, 1994; 1996; Nandy and Basak, 2000; Randi\u0107 et al., 2001; Randi\u0107, 2003; Randi\u0107 and Balaban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2003; Liao and Wang, 2004; Liao et al., 2005; Nandy et al., 2006; Bai et al., 2007; Feng and Wang, 2008) . Each nucleotide of a given DNA sequence is a point in different dimension spaces, and these graphical representations can allow us to qualitatively analyze DNA sequences, and provide a way of viewing, sorting and comparing various genomic sequences. Based on the graphical representation, it is possible to numerically characterize DNA sequence and further quantitatively measure similarity of different DNA sequences. Although protein sequence and DNA sequence belong to symbolic sequences, compared with DNA sequence, there are fewer methods for the graphical representation of protein sequence. This is mainly because extension of DNA graphical representation to protein sequences would enormously increase the number of possible alternative assignments for the 20 amino acids. The amino acid sequence is the key to understanding protein structure and function in the cell, so analysis of amino acid sequence is an important part of post-genomic studies. Recently, several schemes have been proposed in protein graphical representation (Randi\u0107 and Krilov, 1997; Vinga and Almeida, 2003; Bai and Wang, 2005; Li J. et al., 2006; Li C. et al., 2008; Munteanu et al., 2008; Yau et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2008; Wen and Zhang, 2009) . In order to plot amino acid sequence, 20 amino acids in protein sequences are divided into different types, including protein sequence regarded as a word with three, four, or five different letters. Since ordering amino acids based on their physicochemical properties may offer better insights into comparative study of protein than representation of protein based on the random ordering of amino acid, Randi\u0107 (2007) and Yao et al. (2008; outlined different 2D graphical representations of protein sequence based on different physicochemical properties. The graphical representation of protein sequence cannot only describe amino acid sequence, but also measure similarity/ dissimilarity of different protein sequences. However, the methods only consider the string's information of protein, and do not consider adjacent string's information of amino acid sequence. Here, we choose conditional probability to measure adjacent string's information.",

Some alignment-free methods to analyze similarities/dissimilarities of DNA sequences have been proposed. However, there are few alignmentfree methods to analyze protein sequences. The amino acid sequence of a protein is the key to understanding its structure and function in the cell, so we present a new method to analyze protein primary sequence in this paper. The method is based on the graphical representation and conditional probability taken as the numerical characterization of the protein sequence. The demonstrable significance of the new method is that it cannot only analyze similarity/dissimilarity of protein sequences, but also provide more biological information about the protein sequences. According to the IE curve, we can compare the numbers of amino acids of the internal and external groups at different positions. Also the IA curve can be used to compare the numbers of amino acids of the internal and ambivalent groups at different positions. The EA curve can be used to compare the numbers of amino acids in the external and ambivalent groups at different positions. Therefore the three curves show the distribution of the three types of amino acids. Furthermore, the conditional probability reflected the distribution of the two adjacent amino acids. The new approach was applied to ND6 protein sequences of several species and results have shown that the introduction of hydropathy profile of amino acids into protein sequence is effectual and feasible.",
