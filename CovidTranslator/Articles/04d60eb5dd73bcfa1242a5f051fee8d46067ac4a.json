Several reports suggested that TNF-alpha is related to the progression of FIP. Thus, the administration of a feline TNF-alpha-neutralizing antibody to cats with FIP may reduce the disease progression. In this study, we have prepared nine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize feline TNF-alpha. All MAbs neutralized recombinant TNF-alpha. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the MAbs for the cytotoxicity of recombinant TNF-alpha were 5-684 ng/ml. MAb 2-4 exhibited high neutralizing activity against natural TNF-alpha derived from FIPV-infected macrophages, and was confirmed to inhibit the following feline TNF-alpha-induced conditions in vitro: (i) an increase in the survival rate of neutrophils from cats with FIP, (ii) aminopeptidase N (APN) mRNA expression in macrophages, and (iii) apoptosis of a feline T-lymphocyte cell line.",

Membrane-form TNF-alpha is released from the cell surface as a 17-kDa non-glycosylated protein (soluble-form TNF-alpha) through the action of the metalloproteinase, TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE), and enters the circulation as a 55-kDa homotrimer (Moss et al., 1997; Smith and Baglioni, 1987) . Homotrimer TNF-alpha binds to cell surface TNF receptors (TNFR) and induces various physiological activities (Vandenabeele et al., 1995; Reinhard et al., 1997) . For example, when it binds to cell surface TNFR-1, caspase is activated and induces apoptosis, and when it binds to cell surface TNFR-2, transcription factors, such as NF-kB and c-Jun, are activated that promote cell proliferation and induce the expression of cytokines involved in immunity and inflammation.",

Several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen, and central nervous system, are affected in cats that develop FIP, and the formation of lesions in these organs is accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation (Pedersen, 2009) . Pleural effusion and ascitic fluid was shown to accumulate in some FIP cats. Macrophages/monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP. For example, differences in the proliferation of macrophages/monocytes were shown to be related to differences in pathogenicity between feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIPV (Dewerchin et al., 2005; Stoddart and Scott, 1989) . We previously showed that virus replication in macrophages induced TNF-alpha production. TNF-alpha produced by FIPV-infected macrophages was involved in lymphopenia and an increase in the level of the cellular receptor of type II FIPV, aminopeptidase N (APN) (Takano et al., 2007a,b) . Moreover, it was reported that neutrophil apoptosis in cats with FIP was inhibited by TNF-alpha. This finding suggests that neutrophilia in cats with FIP due to TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil survival (Takano et al., 2009) .",

Recombinant TNF-alpha or FIPV-infected macrophage culture supernatants that contained natural TNF-alpha were run using 15% SDS-PAGE and a transferred nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by 1 h incubation at 37\u00b0C with each anti-feline TNF-alpha MAb. Following washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and then visualized in the substrate for 10 min. Control IgG: Anti-glutathione S-transferase mouse MAb. All MAbs neutralized recombinant TNF-alpha activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Of these MAbs, MAb 1-1, 2-3, and 2-4 showed markedly higher neutralizing activities (Table 2, Fig. 2 ). The natural TNF-alpha-neutralizing activity of the MAbs was evaluated. FIPV-infected macrophage culture supernatants were used for natural TNF-alpha. Three MAbs that were selected based on their recombinant TNF-alpha-neutralizing activity were analyzed to determine whether they inhibited natural TNF-alpha cytotoxicity on WEHI-164 cells. MAb 2-4 exhibited strong neutralizing activity, which indicated that it exhibited strong neutralizing activity against both recombinant and natural TNF-alpha (Table 2, Fig. 3 ).",

            "text": "No feline TNF-alpha-neutralizing MAb has previously been prepared. We have prepared nine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize feline TNF-alpha by immunizing mice with recombinant feline TNF-alpha. All of MAbs produced exhibited different reactivities between the recombinant and natural feline TNF-alpha contained in FIPV-infected macrophage culture supernatants using Western blotting. On Western blotting, TNF-alpha was degenerated by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, for which MAb 1-2 and 2-2 did not react with either recombinant or natural TNF-alpha. This result suggests that these MAbs recognized conformation epitope of TNF-alpha. In contrast, MAb 2-1 and 3 react with natural TNF-alpha only; however, the details of their antigen-recognizing properties could not be clarified. Recombinant TNF-alpha forms a monomer (17-kDa), whereas natural TNF-alpha forms a homotrimer (55-kDa), which suggests that recombinant TNF-alpha is monomeric form while natural TNF-alpha is trimetric form (R&B Systems Product data sheet). Therefore, MAb 2-1 and 3 may recognize only trimetric TNF-alpha. Saijo et al. described the preparation of the trimeric human TNF-alpha-recognizing MAb 3F2 (Saijo et al., 1995) . They showed that the weak reactivity of MAb 3F2 was observed with monomeric TNF-alpha dissociated from trimeric TNFalpha by detergent. MAb 2-1 and 3 reacted with immobilized monomeric TNF-alpha on ELISA. Smith and Baglioni. showed that monomeric TNF-alpha bound to one another to form trimeric TNF-alpha in a solution that did not contain a degenerating agent, which indicated that recombinant TNF-alpha also formed trimers in a solution containing no detergent and reacted in ELISA (Smith and Baglioni, 1987) . Therefore, these findings suggest that MAb 2-1 and 3 possess similar properties to those of MAb 3F2.",

Several drugs to treat FIP have been reported, but these mostly aim at an antiviral action (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008; Balzarini et al., 2006; Barlough and Shacklett, 1994; Hsieh et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013) . However, FIP is a viral infection that causes an immune-mediated inflammatory disease. The combination of MAb 2-4 that we prepared using already reported anti-FIPV agent(s) may eliminate the virus while inhibiting inflammatory reactions. Currently, steroids are mainly used to inhibit inflammatory reactions in FIP; however, steroids also inhibit the immune system useful for the elimination of FIPV. Since MAb 2-4 specifically inhibits TNF-alpha, a factor aggravating the pathology of FIP, it may be more appropriate than steroids.",
