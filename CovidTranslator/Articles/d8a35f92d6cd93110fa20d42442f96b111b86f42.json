The structuralbinding defined in c-Abl (Barila and Superti-Furga, role of the Abl N terminus was revealed in a striking 1998). Thus, Bcr-Abl is still autoregulated via its SH3 crystallographic study that demonstrated an interaction domain despite the lack of myristoylation, and cannot of the myristoyl group with the C-terminal lobe of the induce CML unless this inhibition is overcome through Abl catalytic domain(Nagar et al., 2003). Binding of the oligomerization and transphosphorylation or by SH3 myristoyl group induces a conformational change that mutation. It has been postulated that oligomerization of permits the docking of the SH2 domain with the noncata-Bcr-Abl by the coiled-coil domain might contribute to lytic face of the C-lobe in a fashion that closely resemthe pathogenesis of CML through mechanisms other bles the inactive conformation of Src. Together, these than direct effects on Bcr-Abl kinase activity, such as studies suggest that there may be several routes to crosslinking of F-actin microfilaments (McWhirter and activation of c-Abl through displacement of either the Wang, 1993). However, our results demonstrate that myristoyl group, the SH3 domain, or the SH2 domain. However, there are several features of c-Abl that are Bcr-Abl can induce CML-like disease independent of A Model for Bcr-Abl Kinase ActivationThe Bcr sequences, SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains of Abl are depicted. In its monomeric form, Bcr-Abl is unphosphorylated and the Abl SH3 domain interacts with the linker region between the SH2 and catalytic domains. This form of the enzyme binds efficiently to imatinib (shown in orange). Upon oligomerization, a primary phosphorylation event at Tyr1294 is rapidly followed by secondary phosphorylation at Tyr1127, which disrupts the SH3-linker interaction and results in full catalytic activity.In the absence of oligomerization via the coiled-coil domain, kinase and transformation activities can be restored by mutations in the SH3 domain that disrupt ligand binding or by complementary mutation of the SH3 ligand in the SH2-CD linker region. For simplicity, other phosphorylation sites including Tyr177 in Bcr are not shown. oligomerization when released from its autoinhibited antsev et al., 2001). The precise mechanism of SH2dependent activation of Bcr-Abl is not known but has state by other means.Taken together, these observations suggest that an been suggested to involve SH2 binding to phosphoserine residues C-terminal to the coiled-coil domain in Bcr elegant and simple mechanism governs Bcr-Abl catalytic activity(Figure 7). Our results argue that Bcr-Abl (Pendergast et al., 1991b). However, if the similarity between the autoinhibited conformations of Bcr-Abl and can assume an inactive state where the enzyme is monomeric and unphosphorylated. The primary consequence c-Abl extends to the SH2 domain, then SH2 should be docked to the C-lobe of the kinase domain when Bcr-Abl of oligomerization of Bcr-Abl is intermolecular autophosphorylation at Tyr1294 in the activation loop of the is monomeric, and might participate in kinase activation through binding of phosphotyrosine ligands (Hantschel catalytic domain. As in c-Abl (Brasher and Van Etten, 2000), Tyr1294 phosphorylation may lead to secondary et al., 2003). Testing the effect of mutations in SH2 that are predicted to disrupt H-bonding with the kinase do-phosphorylation events, including phosphorylation of Tyr1127, the homolog of c-Abl Tyr245, which results in main C-lobe (Hantschel et al., 2003) on the activity of monomeric Bcr-Abl might clarify the role of SH2. There displacement of the SH3 domain from the SH2-CD linker. The order of phosphorylation may not be obligatory, asis also a discrepancy in the oncogenic activity of one of the mutants, p210Y1127F, which was completely de-autophosphorylation of the linker tyrosine in both c-Abl and Bcr-Abl can occur when the activation loop tyrosine fective for transformation of early B-lymphoid progenitors but readily induced myeloproliferative disease when is mutated (Brasher and Van Etten, 2000; Figure 3). Enzymological studies of purified Bcr-Abl proteins should be expressed in hematopoietic stem cells. Other Bcr-Abl mutations, for example in the SH2 domain (Roumiantsev helpful in confirming this model. While there are additional tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Bcr-Abl and et al., 2001), also differentially affect lymphoid and myeloid leukemogenesis. In the case of p210Y1127F, it is c-Abl, our results suggest that Tyr1294 and Tyr1127 are the major sites that influence the regulation of catalytic possible that phospho-Tyr1127 forms a binding site for an SH2-containing protein that is critical for B-lymphoid activity in both enzymes. Other phosphorylation sites may contribute to leukemogenesis by Bcr-Abl indepen-transformation but not induction of CML. Our results have important implications for the mecha-dent of any role in autoregulation, as is the case with Tyr177, which forms a binding site for the SH2 domain nism of inhibition of Bcr-Abl by imatinib (STI-571).
