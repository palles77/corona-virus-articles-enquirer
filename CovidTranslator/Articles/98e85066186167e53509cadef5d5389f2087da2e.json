The dissection of complex protein dynamics is typically performed using relaxation rates determined at high and ultrahigh field. Here we expand this range of the spectral density to low fields through field cycling using the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus as a model system. The field-cycling approach enables site-specific measurements of R 1 at low fields with the sensitivity and resolution of a high-field magnet. These data, together with high-field relaxation and heteronuclear NOE, provide evidence for correlated rigid-body motions of the entire b-hairpin, and corresponding motions of adjacent loops with a time constant of 0.8 ns (mesodynamics). MD simulations substantiate these findings and provide direct verification of the time scale and collective nature of these motions.",

            "text": "The dynamic nature of proteins is one of the key elements of their function. Although this principle is widely accepted, the detailed characterization of protein motions at atomic resolution is much more challenging than determining the average static structure. High field NMR is a particularly powerful method for studying protein dynamics at atomic resolution over a wide array of time scales and has therefore extensively been used in the last two decades. The major emphasis on the development of ultra-high-field magnets for an increase in sensitivity and resolution has allowed investigations on ever-larger biomolecular systems. Ironically, this high-field regime is not as sensitive to mesodynamics as relaxation data at lower fields. Low-field R 1 relaxation experiments covering 1 H Larmor frequencies up to several tens of MHz have been performed using fieldcycling relaxometers (Kimmich 1996; Luchinat and Parigi 2007) . Due to the low resolution, these experiments have usually probed the relaxation of solvent protons as reporters, and are therefore limited. Here we report R 1 relaxation data of a protein at low field, but with atomic resolution, using a field-cycling apparatus in a commercial 500 MHz magnet (Redfield 2003) . By physically moving the sample in the magnet bore the relaxation behavior can be investigated at various low fields; however, the return of the sample to its initial position allows these measurements with the resolution and sensitivity of the high field. This approach has been successfully applied to studies of lipids and DNA, using one-dimensional 31 P and 13 C spectra (Roberts et al. 2004; Sivanandam et al. 2009 ). Here we use two-dimensional 1 H 15 N heteronuclear experiments spanning from 17.3 to 91.2 MHz ( 15 N Larmor frequency will be used throughout, corresponding to 170-900 MHz ''spectrometers'') to investigate the dynamics of the N-terminal domain of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) nucleocapsid protein (SARSN).",

Previous experiments have indicated a flexible b-hairpin in addition to a relatively rigid antiparallel b-sheet based on the { 1 H}-15 N heteronuclear NOE at 500 MHz (Huang et al. 2004) . Sampling the spectral density over this wider range enabled us to robustly determine the time scale of motions of the hairpin and additional loops (Fig. 1) . Heteronuclear { 1 H}-15 N NOE at differing fields (50.7-91.2 MHz) were particularly useful for establishing the internal correlation times in the disordered regions. Matching internal correlation times of about 0.8 ns for many of these residues are suggestive of correlated motions, which were buttressed by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent.",

A standard thin-walled 5 mm NMR tube is modified with plastic inserts epoxied above and below the sample to avoid bubbles. Previous iterations of this device used a pneumatic driver for the shuttle, but the violent deceleration of the sample at either end of transit apparently led to protein denaturation, even though samples are tightly sealed and degassed to minimize turbulence as described previously (Redfield 2003) . The system has therefore been rebuilt to use a stepper motor to drive a timing belt and push rod to move the sample, allowing for more controlled deceleration (Redfield, in preparation) . Experiments with ferro-cytochrome c were performed to verify that temperature variations during field-cycling could be neglected (data not shown).",

The position of the sample in the fringe field was controlled by digital input to the stepper motor. The field strengths reported in the results reflect the measured field at the center of the sample. R 1 measurements at low field used a standard experiment (Farrow et al. 1994 ) with the addition of commands to control the field-cycling apparatus, and 100-150 ms delays to accommodate the raising and lowering of the sample. This transit delay was adjusted to account for the greater distance necessary to sample low fields. In order to compensate for signal attenuation due to relaxation in transit, 4-8 times as many transients were acquired for these experiments as at high field. Fieldcycling did not affect the lock to a greater extent than did a strong gradient pulse, and no degradation of the lock was observed over the course of the experiment. Proton inversion pulses during the relaxation period were not feasible because of the inhomogeneity of the fringe field and absence of a transmitter coil at the relevant height.",

Errors in the measurements were assessed from base-plane noise and duplicated points; because of the interleaved acquisition, both approaches resulted in similar errors.

Data were weighted by error for v 2 minimization, which for purposes of fitting was defined as the larger of the fitted error or 5%. Excluding flexible residues (Vuister et al. 1993 ), a s m of 11.9 ns was determined by global minimization and used in all subsequent fits. An estimation of tumbling anisotropy using local fits of s m and the 1SSK structure (Huang et al. 2004 ) with the program qfit (Lee et al. 1999 ) indicated D k /D \\ of 0.94, and anisotropy was therefore disregarded in subsequent fitting procedures.

Residues for which more than one violation of model-free constraints (order parameters greater than one or less than zero, or s e /s s C s m ) occurred during the jackknife procedure were shifted to a simpler model. No residues experienced multiple violations during the jackknife when model 2 was used. The initial rounds of model selection included models that incorporate R EX corrections to the R 2 data (models 3 and 4). However, these models were not ultimately selected for any residues because CPMG relaxation dispersion gave no indication of R EX (data not shown), and refinement of model selection excluded those models. Accordingly, the only models used in the final analysis were model 2 (S 2 , s e ) (Lipari and Szabo 1982) , and model 5 (S 2 s , S 2 f , s s ) (Clore et al. 1990 ). The final model-free fits excluded the low-field data in the interest of accuracy (see below), but including these data did not generally change the fitted order parameter by more than 5%.",

When R 1 was measured at a 17.3 MHz field sampled by the field-cycling apparatus, for several residues R 1 was decreased by as much as 25% relative to the majority of the residues (Fig. 2a) . This reduction is also observed at 7 T, but to a lesser extent. These residues were primarily localized to the b-hairpin (residues 90-108) and a loop region spanning residues 60-64. On the contrary, increasing the field strength above 11.7 T resulted in an enhanced R 1 for the same set of residues relative to the rest of the protein. At the highest J Biomol NMR (2009) 45:217-225 219 field employed in this study, 91.2 MHz, the enhancement was as high as 40% (Fig. 2b) . Qualitatively, this ''R 1 crossover'' implies that these residues have greater flexibility than the remainder of the protein. Lower R 1 values are expected for flexible residues at low field because the internal motion depresses the spectral density in the extreme narrowing limit (xs m ( 1). On the contrary, in the spin-diffusion limit (xs m ) 1), flexible residues are expected to have a greater spectral density and thus a higher R 1 than rigid residues. Moreover, the particular frequency at which the crossover occurs defines an approximate range of internal correlation times for these residues. For a protein of this size, the observed R 1 crossover point implies a motion with an internal correlation time in the range of 0.5-1.5 ns.",

The attenuation of the NOEs at higher fields strongly suggests an internal mesodynamic fluctuation. The 15 N NOE is the ratio R NOE c H /R 1 c N , where R NOE is approximately proportional to J(x H ) since x N ( x H , and R 1 is proportional to J(x N ) (Abragam 1961 ). This ratio changes little for rigid residues over a twofold change in Larmor frequency because the respective spectral density values are essentially constant over this frequency range. In contrast, the observed field-dependence of the NOE for flexible residues indicates the presence of a transition in the spectral density over this frequency range. Moreover, the range of Larmor frequencies sampled defines upper and lower bounds for the internal correlation time s (xs & 1 for the center of the transition) of 150 ps \\ s \\ 3 ns. Without knowing where the R NOE c H /R 1 c N ratio flattens out, however, the frequency of the motion cannot be determined with great precision. b Expansion of the highfield data.

For this goal, a complete set of high-field R 1 (Fig. 2b) , NOE (Fig. 3) and R 2 (Fig. 4) data was acquired and used to determine modelfree parameters for all residues of SARSN (Fig. 5) . All residues were fit to a local dynamics model involving either a single order parameter (S 2 ) and internal correlation time (s e ) (model 2, or simple model-free) (Lipari and Szabo 1982) or two order parameters (S 2 f and S 2 s ) and internal correlation times (s s and s f ), where s f is assumed to be *0 (model 5, or extended model-free) (Clore et al. 1990) .",

Critically, the field dependence of the R 1 and NOE data enabled us to robustly determine the correlation time s s of these slower fluctuations. The striking similarity of s s of about 0.8 ns for the entire b-hairpin and adjacent loops (Figs. 1, 5) suggests that these residues undergo a correlated motion as a stable structural unit. This is consistent with the structure showing a regular hydrogen-bonded b-hairpin as well the chemical shifts in this region (Cornilescu et al. 1999) . The high accuracy of the determined s s values arises from the crossover in the R 1 data and the pronounced NOE dispersion data as illustrated by simulated relaxation parameters (Fig. 6) .

As a result, the field is inhomogeneous over the 1.5 cm length of the sample, with a maximal variation of 1.4 T at 30.2 MHz (7 T). The remaining difference between prediction and experiment could in part result from this field inhomogeneity, but could also arise from technical error or from some previously unrecognized shortcoming of the model-free theory. These questions should be investigated further in future by a more complete survey between 5 and 9 T, or possibly at lower field using 13 C carbonyl relaxation. Below 4 T the relaxation rate is expected to be too fast to be measured with our shuttle device for any nuclear spin adjacent to a geminal proton because of relaxation of the measured nuclear spin by the proton.

The MD simulations now provide a rationale for this observation: during the simulations, direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds form between several residues in the hairpin and these flexible loops. For example, the side-chain of R90 hydrogen-bonds temporarily to residues in both loops (Fig. 7c) . These interactions seem to be responsible for coordinating motions of the Fig. 6 Illustration of crossover behavior of R 1 rates and { 1 H}-15 N NOE field-dependence due to the timescale of internal motions. Relaxation rates (Abragam 1961) are predicted from spectral densities calculated from model-free parameters for a protein with a global correlation time of 11.9 ns, the value for our system. a R 1 values predicted from model 2 for S 2 = 0.85, s e = 13 ps (black line), and model 5 for S 2 f = 0.89, S 2 s = 0.71, and s s = 10 ps (orange line), s s = 100 ps (red line), s s = 500 ps (purple line), s s = 780 ps (green line), and s s = 1.0 ns (cyan line). The black and green lines correspond to actual fitted parameters for residues 142 (in the stable globular part of SARSN) and 94 (in the b-hairpin with complex motions), respectively.

Note the strong increase in the NOE value with increasing field for internal correlation times in the 0.5-1 ns range. Arrows indicate fields used in this study hairpin and those loops, explaining the similarity of relaxation dispersions at these sites. Strikingly, the MD simulations elucidate the collective nature of the mesodynamics of the entire b-hairpin and the correlation of motions between the hairpin and the 60-64 loop. These correlations can be computed from the time traces of atomic fluctuations within one molecule through a covariance matrix (Fig. 7d) , emphasizing the value of MD simulations to complement the NMR experiments.",

Given that these residues have very similar internal correlation times and cluster structurally together, we suggest that the relaxation behavior is the result of correlated motions of the hairpin and the 60-64 loop. This model is buttressed by MD simulations. The b-hairpin and the 60-64 loop coincide with several previously-identified sites where SARSN engages in protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, including a ubiquitination site at K62. That areas of significant flexibility in SARSN coincide with residues important for binding interactions is not surprising, because Fig. 7 The b-hairpin moves collectively as a rigid body and its motion is correlated to motions in adjacent loops. a Representative snapshots from the 15 ns MD trajectory in explicit solvent.
