Comparative biology is routinely used on a case by case basis to assess the threat to public health posed by newly discovered pathogens -Schmallenberg virus being a recent example.

First, there are viruses for which R 0 may exceed 1, which implies that they are sufficiently transmissible between humans (via any natural route of infection, which may involve a vector) to cause major epidemics and/or persist endemically in human populations. There is a total of 52 species (including some zoonotic species, e.g. influenza A) in this category. Other viruses always have R 0 less than 1. Some of these are transmissible between humans but not sufficiently so that they can cause major epidemics and/or persist endemically; they are restricted to self-limiting outbreaks. We estimate that there are 28 species of this kind. The remaindercomprising almost half the total of human RNA virus species -is not known to be transmissible between humans at all. This generally reflects their inability to replicate in tissues that permit release from the body (notably the upper respiratory tract, lower gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract or possibly blood).",

First, RNA viruses show little respect for any distinction we might make between ourselves and other mammals (or birds), and the study of their emergence in human populations is a classic \"One Health\" problem. Reflecting this, several important virus taxa -including the retro-, rota-and corona viruses -were known as animal pathogens before they were found in humans and, at least initially, there was greater knowledge of them in the veterinary community than the medical community. Second, we cannot hope to understand the characteristics that make some viruses serious threats to public health if we do not also study those that are not. So we end with a plea not to neglect the more obscure and unregarded human RNA viruses; they too have something to teach us.",

Statistical analysis (that allows for taxonomic relatedness by including genus and family as random effects) using a generalised linear mixed model confirms significant differences when comparing category 3 vs categories 1 + 2 (p = 0.006) or categories 2 + 3 vs category 1 (p < 0.001).",
