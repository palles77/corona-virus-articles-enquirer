In the first experiment, chicks were divided into four groups; one unvaccinated and three groups vaccinated with live NDV VG/GA-Avinew, live H120 + CR88, or VG/GA-Avinew + H120 + CR88. In the second experiment, live aMPV subtype B vaccine was used in place of NDV. Clinical signs were monitored daily and oropharyngeal swabs were taken at regular intervals for vaccine virus detection. Blood was collected at 21 dpv for serology. 10 chicks from each group were challenged with virulent strains of M41 or QX or aMPV subtype B. For IBV, after 5 days post challenge (dpc), tracheal ciliary protection was assessed. For aMPV, clinical scores were recorded up to 10 dpc. For NDV, haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres were assayed as an indicator of protective immunity. In both experiments, ciliary protection for IBV vaccinated groups was maintained above 90%. The protection against virulent aMPV challenge was not compromised when aMPV, H120 and CR88 were coadministered. NDV HI mean titres in single and combined NDV-vaccinated groups remained above the protective titre (>3 log 2 ). Both experiments demonstrated that simultaneous administration of live NDV VG/GA-Avinew or aMPV subtype B alongside H120 and CR88 vaccines does not interfere with protection conferred against NDV, IBV or aMPV.",

Traditionally, NDV and single IBV Massachusetts live vaccines are given to day-old chicks at the hatchery or in the farms, mostly by spray. However, as the disease and losses caused by variant IBVs increase [10] [11] [12] , growing numbers of producers have been including a 793B vaccine in the day-old vaccination programme. All three diseases (IBV, aMPV and NDV) are now routinely controlled in the poultry industry through the use of live attenuated vaccines [13, 14] , with long lasting antibody titres recorded for inactivated NDV vaccinations [15] .",

These publications showed that simultaneous administration of aMPV vaccine alongside NDV or IBV vaccine were compatible, with protection against virulent IBV, NDV or aMPV remaining uncompromised. However, in these studies, only a single vaccine strain of IBV (Massachusetts) was used.

Insertions and deletions (indels) were defined as the insertion or deletion of a nucleotide that altered the sequence length. The d s /d ns ratio, to identify positive or purifying selection pressure for each group was calculated per day. This was done using the Nei-Gojobori method [45] where <1.0 indicated the recovered strains to be under positive selection pressure, and >1.0 indicated strains to be under purifying selection [26, 46] . Positive or purifying selection was considered significant at P < 0.05. Translated amino acid variations were also identified and variations that resulted in a change in hydrophobicity were noted according to the Kyte and Doolittle scale [47] .",

In both experiments, following IBV challenge, mild respiratory signs were observed for the first two days and none thereafter, demonstrating clinical protection conferred by IBV Mass H120 + 793B CR88, with or without NDV or aMPV. Ciliostasis analysis was also used to confirm IBV protection [14] , where a higher protection percentage suggests better protection against a virulent IBV challenge. Ciliostasis results in the current study highlighted excellent IBV protection against M41 and QX challenges in groups receiving H120 + 793B, or the same IBV vaccines given along with aMPV or NDV vaccines. Previous work has shown that the combination of Mass + 793B conferred excellent ciliary protection against Asian (QX and Q1) and Middle East (IS/1494/06 and IS/885/00) IBV strains [25, [48] [49] [50] [51] . When IBV H120 and CR88 vaccine strains are combined with the NDV or aMPV vaccine, protection levels remained at or above 94%. This reconfirms that such combined vaccination did not compromise the protection conferred against virulent IBVs. In addition to the cilia-stopping test, detection of virus and viral load in the trachea and kidney of challenged groups was attempted to demonstrate protection against IBV M41 and QX. No vaccine viruses were detected in the trachea at 5 dpc. However, both virulent challenge viruses were present, suggesting host clearance of IBV vaccines by at least 25 dpv [52, 53] . The co-administration of either NDV or aMPV alongside the IBV vaccine caused a lower IBV vaccine virus load in both the trachea and kidney at 21 dpv. However, post-challenge with virulent IBV, the combined IBV with NDV or aMPV vaccination had no effect on viral load when compared with IBV vaccination alone. For both experiments, despite relatively higher tracheal viral load, a low REU value was shown in kidney tissue from non-IBV vaccinated groups following M41 and QX challenge. These results, along with the cilia-stopping test, demonstrated that comparable levels of protection are found when IBV H120 and CR88 vaccine strains are given either alone or alongside an NDV or aMPV vaccine.",

Current work showed that simultaneous vaccination of NDV + H120 + CR88 in commercial broiler chicks does not interfere with the induction of protective immunity against NDV. In this study, following challenge with virulent aMPV, no clinical signs were found in the single (aMPV) or combined (aMPV + H120 + CR88) vaccinated groups, confirming clinical protection against the challenge virus [19, 23, 59] . Furthermore, following challenge with the virulent strain, no antigen was detected by RT-PCR from tissue samples in either of the vaccinated groups. The aMPV ELISA antibody titres in the triple-vaccinated group was lower than the single vaccinated group, echoing findings from previous work [23] . However, it has been reported that levels of humoral antibodies have no association with clinical protection against aMPV [60, 61] . It is evident that experimental vaccination of commercial broilers (with aMPV and IBV MDAs) with aMPV subtype B and two IBV strains (H120 and CR88) had no adverse effects on clinical protection conferred against a virulent challenge.",

For NDV and aMPV, classical RT-PCRs [32, 40] were applied to RNA extracted from oropharyngeal swabs, with no detection of the NDV vaccine at any sampling points. Previous work has shown detection of NDV vaccine virus in SPF chickens for up to four days post vaccination [19, 62] . In this experiment, first sampling was carried out at 7 dpv, and the failure to detect NDV may have been due to rapid clearance of the vaccine [19] . For aMPV, it was possible to detect the virus up to 7 dpv using dry oropharyngeal swabs and until 21 dpv from tracheal tissue. While identified the aMPV vaccine at 21 dpv in a combined IBV + aMPV vaccinated group [19] , there was no difference between single and combined vaccinated groups in the current study, suggesting that combined vaccination does not impair a host's ability to rapidly clear the aMPV vaccine strain. IBV vaccinal strains have previously been shown to persist in chickens for a longer period [53, 63] . To further investigate this, the growth kinetics and genetic characteristics of live IBV vaccines used in this study were cross compared with previous reports [26, 64] . Vaccinal strains were detected in OP swabs throughout the current experiment, with the variant 793B strain dominating at the later ages of the birds. With both experiments, Sanger sequencing showed that the genotype of strains recovered using OP swabs altered from Mass to 793B after 14 dpv. As reported previously [26, 27] , while the Mass genotype made up the majority of detections during early sampling days (3-14 dpv), the 793B strain became the dominant strain by 21 dpv. The reason for the shifting of genotypes from Mass to 793B is not known, however, previous work has highlighted that different IBV strains can differentially induce host expression pathways, in particular TLR7 [65] and IFN-b [66] . Such differences may have played a role in a host's ability to clear the Mass vaccine virus at an earlier time point when compared to the 793B vaccine. Further work is required to understand potential underlying mechanisms.",

This suggests that under experimental conditions, the vaccine strain underwent minimal alteration following inoculation [26] . Similarly, the 793B vaccine strain remained high for all but one sampling point (99-100% with the exception of 96% at 21 dpv in Experiment 1). Limited genetic changes were noted in the tissues samples, with 3-4 and 4-7.5 SNPs per sequence in the Mass and 793B vaccine strains respectively. A higher number of polymorphisms were seen in the 793B sequences, compared to Massachusetts, indicating that the persistence of this particular genotype may contribute to greater genetic variations within local virus populations [64, 67, 68] . However, the d s /d ns ratios suggest purifying selection for both genotypes [69] , and therefore evolutionary constraint [70] . Previous work implied 793B amino acid variations do not follow a consistent pattern over time [71] , which was also witnessed in the current study. No persistent alteration was witnessed from any tissues in any of the vaccination programs.",
