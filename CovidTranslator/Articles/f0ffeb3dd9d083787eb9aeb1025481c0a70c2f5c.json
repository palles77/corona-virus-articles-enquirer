We assessed the effects of supplementing products containing serum proteins as a component of arrival fluid support or serum proteins plus FOS (in addition to additional solids, minerals, and vitamins) in an early life dietary supplement on performance, morbidity, and mortality of stressed (transport, cold) male calves. Male Holstein calves (n = 93) <1 wk old were stratified by arrival body weight (BW) and plasma protein concentration, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial arrangement of one-time administration of fluid support [either control electrolyte solution (E) or the serum protein-containing arrival formula (AF)] and 14 d of either no supplementation (NG) or supplementation with Gammulin (G; APC Inc., Ankeny, IA), which contains serum proteins and FOS in addition to other solids, minerals, and vitamins. Upon arrival at the research facility, calves were orally administered either AF or E. At the next feeding, half of the calves from each fluid support treatment received either milk replacer (20% crude protein, 20% fat) or the same milk replacer supplemented with G (50 g/d during the first 14 d). Starter and water were freely available. Feed offered and refused was recorded daily. Calf health was assessed by daily assignment of fecal and respiratory scores. Stature measures and BW were determined weekly. Blood samples were obtained at d 0 (before treatments), 2, 7, 14, and 28. Calves were weaned at d 42 and remained in the experiment until d 56. After 2 wk of treatments, calves previously fed AF had greater body length (66.6 vs. 66.0 cm), intakes of dry matter (38.7 vs. 23.5 g/d) and crude protein (9.2 vs. 5.6 g/d) from starter, and cortisol concentration in blood (17.0 vs. 13.9 ng/mL) than calves fed E. Supplementation with G resulted in greater BW gain during the first 2 wk, increased intakes of dry matter and CP, and decreased respiratory scores. For the 8-wk experiment, G supplementation resulted in lower mean fecal score (1.6 vs. 1.8) and fewer antibiotic treatments per calf (1.5 vs. 2.5) than NG. Survival was greater in G than in NG calves (98 vs. 84%). Despite the marked reduction in morbidity and mortality, blood indicators of acute-phase response, urea N, and total protein were not affected by AF or G in transported cold-stressed male calves.",

Despite advances in calf nutrition and health, morbidity and mortality are greater during this time than at any other point of the animal's life (Quigley et al., 2005; NAHMS, 2010) . The main causes of mortality during the preweaned period are diarrhea and respiratory problems, with most of the deaths occurring during the first 2 to 3 wk of life (NAHMS, 2010) . For the dairy enterprise, decreasing morbidity and mortality is important because of the economic losses associated with treating illnesses, decreased calf performance, and death. Factors associated with morbidity and poor performance during the preweaned period are inadequate feeding, poor management, and the presence of stressors such as cold weather and transport (Wells et al., 1996; Svensson et al., 2006b; Vasseur et al., 2010) .",

Adequate colostrum intake and provision of a dry, comfortable, and clean environment to minimize exposure to pathogens are the first steps Evaluation of serum protein-based arrival formula and serum protein supplement (Gammulin) on growth, morbidity, and mortality of stressed (transport and cold) male dairy calves to provide better adaptation of the newborn calf to its new environment (Quigley et al., 1995; Godden, 2008) . Colostrum-deprived calves exposed to unfavorable conditions (e.g., high pathogen loads, environmental stressors) after birth exhibit greater risk for morbidity and mortality (Quigley et al., 2005; Godden, 2008; Gulliksen et al., 2009) . Subsequent nutrition is crucially important to provide all nutrients for proper growth and health; however, adequate nutrition is not enough to ensure proper survival, growth, and health in circumstances where the young calf is immunologically disadvantaged, facing unfavorable environmental conditions, or subjected to other stressors. Transport (Johnston and Buckland, 1976; Odore et al., 2004) and cold weather represent stressors for the young calf, affecting its immune system (Odore et al., 2004; Fike and Spire, 2006) and increasing the susceptibility to enteric and respiratory problems (Fike and Spire, 2006; Svensson et al., 2006a) , which are the principal causes of high morbidity and mortality during the preweaned period (NAHMS, 2010) .",

Previous research with calves (Arthington et al., 2000b; Quigley et al., 2002) suggested that serum protein products improve health and decrease morbidity and mortality (Quigley and Wolfe, 2003) while maintaining or increasing growth. In addition, studies in humans and other species have shown that fructooligosaccharides (FOS) stimulate growth of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, inhibit colonization by pathogens, and improve mineral absorption (Howard et al., 1995; Sabater-Molina et al., 2009; Grand et al., 2013) . Based on these data, our prediction was that products containing serum proteins or serum proteins plus FOS, in addition to milk products (dried whey and dried whey protein concentrate), minerals, and vitamins, would improve performance, morbidity, and mortality of dairy calves subjected to the stressors of winter cold weather and transport, especially during their first 2 to 3 wk of life. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of an arrival fluid support product containing serum proteins or an early life dietary supplement containing serum proteins and FOS among other ingredients on performance, morbidity, and mortality of stressed male calves.",

The model contained the fixed effects of AFS (E or AF), SUP (NG or G), the interaction of AFS and SUP, time (day or week), and interactions of time with treatments. Replicate and calf were considered random effects; calf was nested within replicate, AFS, and SUP.

The covariance structures considered for repeated measures analysis were compound symmetric, autoregressive order one, and unstructured. The covariance structure that yielded the lowest Akaike information criterion-corrected value was autoregressive order one, and therefore it was used in the models (Littell et al., 1998) . Initial measurements (before treatment administration) of BW, withers height, body length, heart girth, hip height, hip width, and concentrations of plasma albumin, ASP, cortisol, haptoglobin, and Zn at d 0 were used as covariates when analyzing the respective data.

Because the commercial products tested in our study contained several ingredients that differed from the control treatments, it is not possible to discern whether serum proteins exerted the predominant effects or if the FOS and other ingredients worked additively or synergistically with the serum proteins. Future experiments could examine these component factors individually or in factorial combinations in comparison with appropriate controls. Improvements in health for calves supplemented with G also might be related in part to greater nutrient intake in those calves, as supplementation with G led to greater intake of milk replacer DM and CP by design during the first 2 wk. These results agree with Quigley et al.

Plasma cortisol concentrations in AF-fed calves were greater than those in calves fed E, but concentrations were still very much lower than values of 38.0 and 79.0 ng/mL reported by Khan et al. (1970) and Willett and Erb (1972) , respectively. Thus, these increases in our study were small and likely cannot be considered biologically elevated.

The AF, which contained serum proteins in addition to additional milk solids, minerals, and vitamins, promoted starter intake, growth, and improved fecal score during the first 2 wk. Similarly, G supplementation increased early nutrient intake and stimulated early growth, decreased incidence of respiratory problems at 2 wk, and significantly decreased mortality. Whether these effects may be the result of serum proteins, FOS, and other ingredients working additively or synergistically cannot be discerned in the present study. Indicators of acutephase response were not affected by AF versus E or G versus NG. Because serum IgG status was somewhat better by random chance in calves assigned to receive G than in calves that were not supplemented, decreases in mortality and morbidity in G-supplemented calves should be confirmed in studies with larger numbers of at-risk calves. tend our gratitude to all the graduate and undergraduate students that assisted with this research.",
