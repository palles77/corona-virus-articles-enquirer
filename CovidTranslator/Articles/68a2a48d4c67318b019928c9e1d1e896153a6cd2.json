If patient i reported that infection most likely occurred in a period of exposure between times Li and Ui, where Li \u2264 Xi \u2264 Ui, the incubation time therefore is bounded by the interval (Z -Ui, Z -Li). These data are a special type of survival data, and a convenient approach would be to reverse the time axis setting Z as the origin and X as the outcome time. Reversing the time axis is valid only when the density function for infection is uniform in chronologic time. This condition should be reasonable in the setting of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, with each exposure interval being relatively short.",
