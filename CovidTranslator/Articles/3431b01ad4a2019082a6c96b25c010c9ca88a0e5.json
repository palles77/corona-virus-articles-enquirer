This report describes the secular trends in HCAI at the NTUH over the past 27 years according to site of infection, aetiological agents and control measures. Clinical and microbiological data were collected by infection prevention and control nurses using a standardised case-record form. Specific control programmes were implemented and/or intensified as needed. Poisson or negative binomial regression analysis was used to quantify time trends of the incidence of HCAI. The annual number of discharges increased from 25 074 to 91 234 with a parallel increase in the Charlson comorbidity index. Active HCAI surveillance and periodic feedback were associated with a marked decrease in surgical site infections from 1981 to 2007 (2.5 vs 0.5 episodes per 100 procedures, P < 0.0001). On the other hand, there was a 4.8-fold increase in bloodstream infections (BSIs) (0.39 vs 1.88 episodes per 100 discharges, P < 0.0001). The average annual increase of pathogen-specific HCAI incidence during 1981e2007 was 11.4% for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 75.4% for extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDRAB), and 7.5% for Candida albicans (P < 0.0001, respectively). The infection prevention and control programme was upgraded in 2004 by implementing annual, intensive, project-based control programmes, and decreases in rates of HCAI, BSI, MRSA and XDRAB were observed. This long term study demonstrates the need to couple surveillance of HCAI with focused control programmes. Hospitals must invest in adequate manpower to accomplish these goals.",

The goals are to assess the burden of infectious diseases, identify important problems, monitor the efficacy of specific interventions and support rational hospital policies. 1 The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System was established in the 1980s. HCAIs were reported to be significantly decreased in hospitals that adopted surveillance programmes. 2, 3 Hospital-wide surveillance programmes are highly labour intensive and tend to divert resources needed to implement control measures and prevention activities. Consequently, they are often of minimal interest to hospital policymakers except during major outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). It has become increasingly apparent that hospital support for surveillance programmes needs to be justified by improved outcomes. To accomplish these goals they must be closely linked to effective interventional strategies.",

Hospital charts were reviewed to identify patients with HCAIs according to definitions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the help of infectious disease physicians at weekly meetings. 4e6 The data were collected on standardised data collection forms (Appendix 1) and incorporated into the computer database by manual entry.

Prevention and control measures for surgical site infection (SSI) included intensified surveillance of SSI with feedback to the surgeons during 1988e1990, monitoring the timing and choice of prophylactic antibiotics, reinforcement of aseptic procedures, amelioration and monitoring ventilation in the operation rooms since 1991, and enhanced environmental cleaning in 1992. Organism-specific isolation precautions for meticilllin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were initiated in 1990 and this was augmented in 1993 for extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB) in 2001 and SARS-specific precautions during March to June 2003. 7e9 The infection control guideline for XDRAB requiring contact isolation (single room cohort) was introduced in 2001. This was reinforced the following year by requiring ICNs to inform staff to isolate patients with XDRAB. Hospital-wide surveillance of HCAIs was interrupted temporarily during the SARS epidemic because the ICNs were fully occupied with containing SARS. The infection prevention and control programme was upgraded in 2004 by implementing annual, intensive, project-based control programmes. The hospital-wide hand hygiene programme was instituted in April 2004 and has continued as an annual campaign. Targeted surveillance and control for device-associated infections in ICUs (e.g. urinary catheters, central venous catheters, and ventilators) and SSI for selected surgical procedures were initiated in 2000 and intensified since 2005. Data were analysed and compared with national and international data and feedback every quarter.",

The differences in the incidence and proportion of the major sites contributing to HCAIs in 1981 and 2007 are shown in Table I . SSI was the leading cause of HCAI during 1981e1993. A peak in SSI was noted during 1988 to 1990. This was attributed to more intensive surveillance but without post-discharge surveillance (PDS). The incidence of SSI decreased sharply after intensified infection control programmes. BSI gradually increased over the study period. There was a 4.8-fold rise in BSI from 1981 to 2007 (P < 0.0001). BSI was the leading HCAI site during 1994e2007, accounting for 41.6% of HCAI in 2007. The incidence of UTI increased 1.8-fold (P < 0.0001). Table I . Gram-negative bacteria were about twice as common as Gram-positives during both time periods. There was an 8.7-fold increase in fungal infections (mainly Candida spp.) from 1981 to 2007 (P < 0.0001).

However, there was no PDS apart from those patients readmitted for postoperative complications. Changes in HCAIs may be due to multiple factors (e.g. implementation of targeted surveillance, SARS outbreak, multidrug-resistant organism outbreaks, active surveillance, etc.), and the rates of HCAI may fluctuate over time. We instituted several focused control programmes to deal with the increasing occurrence of MRSA and XDRAB. These consisted of more intense surveillance, strict isolation procedures for patients with XDRAB and a hand hygiene programme to control multidrugresistant organisms.",

Therefore when considering HCAIs, regional factors should be considered. Despite these achievements we have not as yet been able to achieve our goal to reduce overall infection rates below 4.5%. It may be impossible to reduce the rate in a structurally and immunocompromised patient population that requires aggressive antimicrobial therapy for endogenous infections. A third of patients had one or more malignancies. This hospital also maintains very active organ and bone marrow transplantation programmes and ICUs. Rates of infection are more meaningful when adjusted for major underlying diseases and disease severity, such as the Charlson comorbidity index, the McCabeeJackson criteria and Acute Physiological Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score. 13, 29, 30 It is apparent from these observations that there needs to be a major shift in hospital infection prevention and control measures from passive surveillance to focused control programmes of proven efficacy. 5 The CDC 12-step campaign to prevent antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings provides a good start. Some of the key measures optimise conditions that prevent infections, e.g. removing an unnecessary device, minimising broad spectrum antibiotics, avoiding long term antimicrobial prophylaxis, treating infection rather than colonisation, and preventing transmission. Our major successes were achieved when we adopted some of these measures.",

Also regression analysis allows us to state the annual changes in HCAI rates. However, there are limitations to this study from the methodological viewpoint. This study has demonstrated that changes in HCAIs were due to multiple factors which occurred in different time periods. Thus, the underlying trend might not be continuously increasing or decreasing. Also, the time trends might not be the same for overall HCAI rate, site-specific or pathogenspecific HCAI rates. The model used in our study to quantify the linear trend could not account for other variations such as possible serial correlation. However, a longer time period of one year was used in our analysis, to minimise the correlations between adjacent periods. 12 In conclusion, this long term prospective hospital-wide surveillance study indicates what needs to be addressed to prevent and control HCAI. There needs to be a shift in the paradigm from surveillance with feedback to implementation of proven, control measures using focused surveillance to monitor efficacy. This will require a greater investment on the part of hospitals, if we want to reduce HCAI to the minimum and thus improve the quality and safety of patient care.",
