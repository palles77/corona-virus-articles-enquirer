It has been observed that this beneficial effect can last long after completion of CEU, which is thought to represent a sustained ATP release that occurs from not only acute cellular microporation but also from purinergic channel activation (5) . In this study, we investigated how limb flow augmentation and ATP release in mice could be optimized by modifying US transmit settings (line density, pulse duration) that influence the pressure and shear conditions during MB inertial cavitation. We then applied this knowledge in a first-in-human trial to test the hypothesis that augmentation in limb blood flow could be achieved by CEU performed with short-duration MB cavitation protocols in normal human subjects and in patients with PAD. We also tested whether flow augmentation occurs remotely from the US-exposed region based on the potential of cavitation to increase systemic concentrations of ATP or vasodilators. has been shown not to produce any detectable changes in perfusion (4) . MBs were infused at a rate of 1 \u00c2 10 7 min -1 . Time-intensity data at a frame rate of 5 Hz were acquired after a high-power (MI 1.0) 5frame sequence and were fit to the function: y \u00bc A(1\u00c0e bt ); using non-linear least-squares regression, where y is intensity at time t, A is the plateau intensity representing relative microvascular blood volume, and the rate constant b is the microvascular flux rate (7) . Microvascular blood flow was quantified by the product of A and b (7) . differences were assessed using unpaired Student's t-test, or using Mann-Whitney U test for data that were determined to be non-normally distributed using D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus test. Comparisons within a group (i.e., change in perfusion from baseline) was evaluated using paired Student's t-test or Wilcoxon test.

The effects of US on microvascular resistance are amplified several-fold by the presence of MB contrast agents, including those that are approved for diagnostic use in humans (4, 9) . In this study, we have tested the vascular effects of different acoustic settings within regulatory pressure limits that can be implemented on a clinical scanner and tested efficacy in humans to show that a >2 fold increase in limb blood flow is achievable in normal subjects and patients with PAD. Our preclinical studies focused entirely on MB cavitation because we have previously demonstrated that limb flow augmentation is much less with US alone compared with CEU, despite a duty factor (duration of US exposure) that is several orders of magnitude higher (4) . It is also known that limb flow augmentation produced by inertial cavitation increases with the acoustic pressures up to the limits of a clinical scanner without causing adverse bioeffects (4) . Accordingly, the examination of line density in the current study was intended to find a balance between: 1) avoiding \"between-line gaps\" at low line density, which results in a situation where some MBs are not exposed to high acoustic pressures; and 2) avoiding MB cavitation by a neighboring line at high line density, which would destroy MBs before exposure to the intended high acoustic pressures ( Figure 1A) . Pulse duration was also studied based on the knowledge that MBs can undergo sustained cavitation with long pulses, probably through the continued acoustic activity of free gas released from the shell boundaries (10, 11) . For the long pulse durations, we compared continuous 40-cycle to segmented 8 \u00c2 5-cycle scheme because previous studies have been performed with the latter and yet sustained cavitation without cycle interruption may In vivo studies have indicated that the release of ATP is a key process in CEU-mediated flow augmentation (Central Illustration), acting secondarily through a variety of vasodilators including nitric oxide, adenosine, and prostanoids (5) . In the current study, settings that were most reliable for increasing flow also produced the greatest ATP signal at the USexposed site. However, our findings also indicate that ATP signal is not proportionally related to flow augmentation. This phenomenon could be explained by existence of a threshold concentration over which ATP does not further increase flow, or because purinegic signaling is likely to be dominated by ATP transiently released from shear forces on red blood cells during US (5, 12) . Also, signal on optical imaging is unlikely to be only from intravascular ATP, which mediates vasodilation, but can also reflect interstitial ATP, which can produce neurogenic vasoconstriction (13, 14) .",

Successful implementation of such a strategy will require further investigation into protocol changes that could produce a longer duration of effect. According to murine data, this may be possible with greater spatial extent of cavitation, or with MB agents that circulate for a long duration before clearance, thereby increasing the potential duration of therapy. Cavitation of MBs is also being explored for its ability to accelerate clot lysis in acute MI and in peripheral thrombotic events (15) (16) (17) . The ability to increase tissue perfusion independent of sonothrombolysis needs to be considered when examining the efficacy of these therapies. has been used to transiently open the blood-brain barrier for drug delivery (4, 5) ; deliver therapeutic RNAs directly into target cells (sonoporation) (6,7); rescue tissue flow in the setting of microvascular obstruction (8) ; recanalize acutely thrombosed epicardial coronary or cranial arteries (sonothrombolysis) (9) ; and decrease brain beta-amyloid accumulation and cognitive dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer disease (10) .

Plasma ACE2 levels correlated with the extent of valvular calcification but not AS severity. The median ACE2 level in the AS cohort was 34 pmol/ml/min, which was similar to levels we reported in a high-risk cohort with coronary artery disease (9) (median: 29 pmol/ml/min) and higher than levels in patients with atrial fibrillation (10) or in young healthy volunteers (mean: 4 pmol/ml/min) (16) .

Plasma ACE2 levels also reflect cardiac structural alterations. For example, in human atrial fibrillation, increased plasma ACE2 activity was associated with more advanced left atrial structural remodeling assessed by electroanatomic mapping (10) . In patients with heart failure, elevated circulating ACE2 levels independently predicted cardiovascular events (death, cardiac transplantation, or heart failure hospitalization) after 34 months of follow-up and were positively correlated with imaging indexes of ventricular remodeling and dysfunction (7) . Similarly, following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, circulating ACE2 activity increased in relation to the infarct size and correlated with more severe LV remodeling on cardiac magnetic resonance (8) .",

After image localization, subjects underwent rest cine CMR, native T 1 and T 2 mapping, and maximal supine bicycle ergometer exercise followed by 3 successive native T 1 and T 2 mapping scans. To assess reproducibility, healthy subjects also partook in a second exercise followed by 2 successive native T 1 and T 2 mapping scans during the same session. Peak stress was targeted based on achieving a heart rate of at least 0.85 \u00c2 (220 \u00c0 age), with age in years. Figure 1B shows the CAD patient protocol.

Native T 1 was elevated in all healthy subjects immediately after exercise and tended to decrease by the second scan (2.5 to 3.0min after exercise completion), and returned to baseline by the third scan (4.5 to 5.5 min after exercise completion).

In addition, in this pilot study, exercise stress and/or rest T 1 mapping seemed to be similar to SPECT/MPI in its ability to detect significant CAD. Exercise stress and/or rest T 1 mapping could overcome the limitations of soft tissue attenuation and low spatial resolution of SPECT/MPI (20) . A multicenter perfusion CMR study showed a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 67% with an AUC of 0.86 for detecting significant CAD on coronary x-ray angiography (1) . Similarly, the large CE-MARC CMR study demonstrated that the AUC of comprehensive CMR (left ventricular function, myocardial perfusion, late gadolinium enhancement, coronary artery imaging) was 0.84 (2) . These AUC values were slightly higher than that of our exercise stress and/or rest native T 1 mapping. The present study demonstrated that exercise stress and/or rest native T 1 mapping could be an effective alternative to radionuclide MPI for detection of flow-limiting coronary stenosis without GBCA or ionizing radiation.

However, it was known that MRPP was well correlated with myocardial blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption during exercise. It would be ideal for healthy subjects to partake in a second exercise followed by native T 1 and T 2 mapping scans on 2 separate days to assess reproducibility of T 1 reactivity. We assessed 3 middle slices covering the left ventricle to report the degree of T 1 reactivity heterogeneity in healthy control subjects.

Although regadenoson offers the ease of a bolus injection and is not contraindicated in asthma, it does not match adenosine in its ability to provide the added benefit of being able to detect inadequate stress using the splenic switch-off sign (10) . Furthermore, both adenosine and regadenoson are both hampered by the fact that caffeine is a powerful antagonist to their vasodilatory effects (11) . This is further complicated by data that show that between 8% and 19% of patients undergoing vasodilator stress have residual levels of caffeine in their blood, and this is likely due to delayed caffeine metabolism rather than noncompliance regarding avoiding caffeine consumption (12) .",

Early developments in the field showed the ability to detect metabolic changes associated with myocardial ischemia using CMR spectroscopy during hand-grip exercise performed inside the scanner (16) . This was arguably the first example of \"no gad, no drugs\" CMR testing of myocardial ischemia. In this issue of iJACC, Nakamori et al. (17) add to the body of literature on cardiac imaging techniques and the \"no gad, no drugs\" CMR approach to evaluating myocardial ischemia by combining in-scanner supine bicycle exercise stress with native T 1 mapping. This pilot study in 28 patients showed that T 1 reactivity during exercise stress could detect a physiological signal related to exerciseinduced myocardial ischemia, and that this was associated with the severity of myocardial perfusion defect by single-photon emission computed tomography. For the first time, the investigators present rest and stress native T 1 mapping images using a color scale with which it is possible to visually evaluate the magnitude and variability of the differences between remote and ischemic myocardium. These T 1 maps and the manually defined regions of interest for measuring T 1 illustrate that although this novel work should be applauded for showing that the approach can detect a signal, there are a number of hurdles remaining before such a technique can provide convincing images for robust clinical adoption.",

Within the field of machine learning, the lowhanging fruit is often thought to be the automation of tasks that are \"easy but tedious.\" Without a doubt, quantitative analysis of CMR images is tedious, but is it easy? The answer to that question lies in the nature of the images themselves. If signal-to-noise and spatial resolution are high, motion artifacts are absent, and the heart itself is physiologically normal, quantitative analysis is typically easy. The difficulty rises exponentially, however, when image quality is poor or images are acquired in patients with aspects of cardiac structure and function that differ markedly from those of normal volunteers.

CMR imaging detects the presence of replacement myocardial fibrosis by using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and diffuse reactive myocardial fibrosis using extracellular volume (ECV) fraction calculated from T1 mapping (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Both LGE and ECV correlate strongly with collagen content as measured by histological investigation, suggesting that they are both surrogate markers of myocardial fibrosis (9, 12, 15, 16) . Recent studies have reported an association between LGE and ECV with worse outcomes in patients with AS (10, 11, (17) (18) (19) . Several factors, and in particular age and sex, may also have an effect on the expansion of diffuse myocardial fibrosis, a key marker of LV decompensation in AS (18, 20) . The objectives of the current study were therefore to assess the determinants of diffuse (ECV) and focal (LGE) myocardial fibrosis in patients with AS, and in particular, to assess the effect of sex on these 2 types of fibrosis.

However, most patients with AS are >60 years of age, and the effect of sex hormones on the profibrotic process in postmenopausal women remains unknown. Conversely, chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is believed to play a key role in the cardiac remodeling process as well as in the profibrotic process (32) . Some evidence suggests that these processes may predominantly affect female hearts (32, 47) . Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms for the sex differences in the magnitude of myocardial fibrosis in patients with AS.",

The latter findings could reflect the presence of impaired coronary microcirculation related to the LV hypertrophic response and increased LV transmural pressures associated with AS (1) . Some studies reported that among patients with AS, the coronary microcirculation is more frequently impaired in women (48) . In men, older age and higher LV mass index were associated with higher ECV fraction; LV mass index was the strongest variable Tastet et al.",

Therefore, in men, the LV hypertrophic response due to chronic pressure overload seems to be the main factor for the adverse LV remodeling and subsequent fibrosis (Supplemental Figure 4 ). This outcome is consistent with a previous study that reported maladaptive LV remodeling associated with the activation of profibrotic markers predominantly in men with AS (49) . The association of older age with higher ECV fraction in men has been previously reported (31) . This finding is also supported by histological evidence suggesting that the aging process associated with myocyte cell loss affects the myocardium of men but not women (50) . ECV fraction is not specific to fibrosis, and thus it is possible that the larger ECV fraction in women could be related to many other factors, including the intravascular compartment rather than interstitial expansion due to diffuse myocardial fibrosis (55).",

This is probably related to different study populations because most other studies evaluated symptomatic patients with severe AS, whereas the current report evaluated patients with mild to severe AS. The fact that the inclusion of less severe AS in the study led to the finding of a higher ECV fraction in women indicates that there is significant background myocardial fibrosis related to age and female sex, not related to AS. Concentric LV hypertrophy was more frequent in women when echocardiography was used and in men when cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used.

Such atherosclerotic plaque morphology can now be assessed non-invasively using coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, and has been described as a strong predictor of adverse events (10, 11) . Recently, these high-risk plaques have been linked to hyperemic myocardial blood flow and FFR, independent of luminal stenosis severity (12) (13) (14) . Hypothetically, this might in part explain the relationship between a low FFR and the risk of cardiac events beyond angiographic stenosis significance (15) .",

Histopathologic studies showed that ruptured fibrous caps lack layered smooth muscle cells and feature different collagen phenotypes than intact caps (20) , which offers an explanation for the low birefringence observed in the fibrous caps of patients with ACS and/or PR. In addition to cap birefringence, minimum fibrous cap thickness and lipid arc angle also featured statistically significant differences between these 2 patient groups. Yet fibrous cap thickness alone is insufficient to identify caps that are prone to rupture (4, 5, 8, 9) . The polarization metrics available to intravascular polarimetry complement these structural features and may advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of ACS with or without fibrous cap rupture (10, 21) . Second, our plaque classification corresponds well to the current understanding of plaque subtypes in OFDI (6) and could be readily performed on the conventional OFDI signal, yet conventional OFDI has limited ability to classify lesion types, especially in advanced lesions (11, 14) . Although lipid-rich plaques offer some prognostic implication From a prediction perspective, plaque composition assessed in patients with stable and unstable CAD is associated with the development of future clinical events (4, 9) . Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution intravascular imaging technique that can assay coronary wall structure on a histopathological scale (w10 to 20 mm), and has been used for detecting high-risk plaques (10) . However, the predictive ability of OCT and other intracoronary imaging modalities remains modest, and the quest for new prognostic developments in the intracoronary imaging arena is ongoing (11) . Finite element modeling (FEM) is a widely accepted computational tool for biomechanical profiling of coronary plaques. In FEM, plaque contours are determined using idealized models (8, 9) , histology cross sections (10, 11) , or imaging tools such as virtual histology, IVUS, or computed tomography (CT) (12) (13) (14) .",

Various morphological factors, including fibrous cap thickness (8, 11) , NC size (11, 12, 14) , plaque burden (13), stenosis severity (8) , and presence of calcifications (13) , have been shown to influence peak stress.

Other studies also reported a similar annulus height between those with and without atrial functional MR despite the larger annulus in atrial functional MR, suggesting a more flattened annulus is present in patients with atrial functional MR (20, 22, 23, 25) . Thus, flattened annulus seems to be pervasive as well. In total, 9 studies referring to the prevalence of atrial functional MR in patients with AF and preserved LV function ( (Figure 8 ). Multivariate analysis also showed that MR was a significant predictor of worse outcomes (hazard ratio: 4.0; 95% confidence interval: therefore, comprehensive multiparametric grading is recommended (6, 57) . Novel 3D methods including vena contracta area and 3D proximal isovelocity surface area have the potential to overcome these limitations regarding orifice shape (58, 59) .

We perform a nongated (medium-to-high pitch) helical scan of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis (from external auditory canal to lesser trochanter). For the venogram scan, an 80-s delay after the cardiac scan is used to allow adequate contrast opacification of the required venous structures (34) . In our experience, peak femoral venous opacification can be quite variable and an 80-s delay from the cardiac scan has been selected with goal of obtaining within 90% peak venous opacification (as measured in HU). (Figures 6A and 6B) . In situations of renal impairment or a desire to limit contrast volume, a total of 30 to 40 ml contrast at 4 ml/s ( Table 3 ) could be used, by slightly adjusting the recommended protocol (eliminating the second 25/75% contrast/saline injection). For annuloplasty devices that will be implanted with proximity to the right coronary artery, the CT protocol should trigger off of the thoracic aorta with reduced scan delay to 2 s, using a faster 4.5 to 5 ml/s flow rate, so as to ensure adequate right coronary and right heart opacification ( Figures 7A and 7B) .

As a result, if the LVEDV is not markedly enlarged (as is true for hearts that have microcirculatory dysfunction or fibrosis or an infiltrative or hypertrophic process rather than ventricular remodeling and enlargement), the calculation of LVEF will indicate that systolic function is normal, when it is (in fact) meaningfully (and often markedly) impaired (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) .",

In fact, for the 1,062 patients with a normal visual read, annualized event rates ranged considerably from 1.6% to 3.4% for stress total perfusion deficits quantified automatically from 0% to $5% of the myocardium. A similar stratification was also reported for those patients with a summed stress score of 0. These data support an important further stratification of risk, which to date has not been appreciated in nuclear interpretation.",

We are also seeing growth in the use of cardiac PET, and it would be fundamental to optimal patient care that trial evidence support the superiority of accuracy and improvement in clinical outcomes when compared with other competitive modalities, including SPECT.",

Modifications of the US field for murine experiments were performed by programming a commercial imaging system (EPIQ 7, Philips Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts) to deliver customized pulse sequences on a matrix-a pulse-repetition frequency of 10 kHz. The second modified variable was US line density, which, as described inFigure 1A, can influence MB inertial cavitation pressure. Beams were transmitted in sequence spanning a 64 arc and beam overlap was modified by altering the angle between neighboring beams to be 1 , 2 , or 4 , producing a sector of 65, 33, and 17 lines, respectively. All piezoelectric elements were programmed to be active on transmit with a rectangular apodization across the elements laterally and in elevation to create as narrow a beam width as possible at the focus.ACOUSTIC FIELD TESTING AND BEAM PROFILING. Acoustic pressures produced using the X5-1 transducer were measured as a function of the applied output voltage using a calibrated capsule hydrophone (HGL-0200/AH-2010, ONDA Corp., Sunnyvale, California) submerged in a degassed water tank. The hydrophone was positioned at the location of maximum US intensity, and signals from the hydrophone were captured in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Maryland) for offline analysis. The 3-dimensional pressure fields produced from the custom pulsing sequence were mapped by translating the hydrophone using a 3-axis motorized positioning system. Hydrophone signals were captured in MATLAB at each position within the volume of interest and analyzed offline. Volumes of interest were typically sampled in step sizes of 2 mm axially, 0.5 mm laterally, and 0.5 mm elevationally. Hydrophone data were upsampled 10-fold using cubic interpolation for final graphical representation. To validate beam transmit design, custom scripts were developed to simulate the beam patterns of the X5-1 matrix transducer using the Field-II Simulation Program (6), and incorporating the transducer geometry and pulsing conditions described above. Specifically, the simulation was compared with hydrophone data to determine how accurately simulations represented overlap conditions and the general lateral and elevational beam width. MICROBUBBLES. For murine and in vitro experiments, lipid-shelled decafluorobutane MBs were prepared using sonication of a gas-saturated aqueous suspension of distearoylphosphatidylcholine (2 mg/ml) and polyoxyethylene-40-stearate (1 mg/ml). MB concentrations and size distributions were measured using electrozone sensing (Multisizer III, Beckman Coulter, Brea, California). was created. A mixture of degassed US gel and water (2:1 vol:vol) was combined with MBs for a final concentration of 1.7 x 10 5 ml -1 . The MB suspension was placed in 35-mm culture dishes and covered with clear paraffin film. The gel phantom was suspended in degassed deionized water in the path of the US transducer at a distance equal to the acoustic focus (4 cm). Therapeutic US using the conditions above were generated at a frame rate of 1 Hz. The spatial assessment of contrast was visually assessed every 5 frames for 30 frames by using low-mechanical index (0.16) contrast-specific CEU imaging at 7 MHz (Sequoia 512, Siemens Medical, Mountain View, California) with linear-array transducer oriented orthogonally to the therapeutic transducer to image the entire circular area of the dish.

Wild-type C57Bl/6 mice (n \u00bc 50) were studied at 10 to 20 weeks of age. Mice were anesthetized for study procedures with inhaled isofluorane (1.0% to 1.5%) mixed with room air and kept euthermic with external heating sources. A jugular vein was cannulated for intravenous access for administration of MBs and luciferase. The proximal left hindlimb was exposed to therapeutic US for 10 min. The X5-1 transducer was placed 4 cm from the mid-portion of the muscle using a fixed transverse imaging plane and the acoustic focus was placed at the mid-muscle depth.

Firefly luciferase (25 mg, Thermo Fisher) was injected by intravenous route 1 min prior to completion of the 10 min US exposure.

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Oregon Health & Science University, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03195556). Ten healthy adult volunteers and 10 patients with PAD were recruited. Patient inclusion criteria were a history of unilateral or bilateral PAD diagnosed based on moderate to severe symptoms (Rutherford symptom class 2 to 6) and diagnostic confirmation based on reduced ankle-brachial index (<0.9) or angiography. Subjects were excluded for medical illnesses affecting limb perfusion, severe (New York Heart Association functional class IV) heart failure, hemodynamic instability, pregnancy, lactation, or hypersensitivity to US contrast agents. Therapeutic CEU was performed during a continuous intravenous infusion of perflutren lipid MBs (DEFINITY, Lantheus Medical Imaging, North Billerica, Massachusetts). One vial diluted to 30 ml in normal saline was infused at 2 ml/ min. Therapeutic CEU of the calf muscle from a single limb, which for subjects with PAD was the limb with the lowest ankle-brachial index, was performed for 9 min. US was performed using harmonic power Doppler (Sonos 5500, Philips Ultrasound) at 1.3 MHz with a pulse repetition frequency of 9.3 kHz, an MI of 1.3, and the acoustic focus set at the level of the mid soleus (Supplemental Figure 1). Use of this system for human studies was based on it being a Food and Drug Administration-approved system capable of providing acoustic conditions (64 lines, 8 \u00c2 5-cycle pulses) closest to the experimentally programmed condition used in mice. Four adjacent short-axis elevational planes of the calf separated by 1 cm were exposed. The frame rate was set at 0.5 Hz (pulsing interval of 2 s) and 2 frames were used for each plane to ensure complete MB cavitation before advancing to the next imaging plane in a proximal to distal sequence before returning to the proximal plane. This paradigm allowed for a 7-s interval for complete MB replenishment between each 2-frame bundle. Healthy volunteers returned on a separate day to assess the effects of US alone without MBs. The leg contralateral to the CEU-exposed limb was imaged using identical settings except US was performed with continuous imaging (10 to 15 Hz) for 2 s in each adjacent plane because pulsing intervals are required only for MB refill. Muscle perfusion was assessed using CEU imaging performed bilaterally before, immediately after, and 1 h after therapeutic US. Pretherapy perfusion imaging was not performed for US-alone conditions to avoid the presence of MBs during therapy. LIMB PERFUSION IMAGING IN HUMANS.",

The ratio of the pressure amplitude at the region of line overlap relative to maximal acoustic pressure at the acoustic focus was 0.56, 0.87, and 0.96 for the 17-line, 33-line, and 65-line transmission, respectively. SPATIAL ASSESSMENT OF CAVITATION. Experiments using stationary MBs suspended in gel revealed modest differences in the spatial-temporal pattern of inertial cavitation using a 5-cycle pulse according to line density (Figure 2). Analysis for regions-of-interest that included either the primary beam elevation (Figures 2A and 2C) or that were expanded to include side-lobes (Figures 2B and 2D) demonstrated that increasing line density produced a more complete, more rapid, and slightly larger area of inertial cavitation. These data also demonstrate that any potential three-dimensional (3-D) exposure would best be suited with approximately 1 cm rastering in the elevational direction to avoid unnecessary overlap of cavitation fields. LIMB PERFUSION AND ATP RELEASE IN MICE. After 10 min of high-power US exposure to produce MB inertial cavitation, CEU perfusion imaging revealed a significant increase in limb perfusion in the US-exposed versus contralateral control limb for all conditions irrespective of line density and pulse length (Figure 3). At the lowest line density (17 lines), there was a stepwise increase in perfusion in the USexposed limb for the 5-cycle, the 8 \u00c2 5-cycle, and the 40-cycle pulse scheme. In contrast, pulse duration did not significantly influence the degree of flow augmentation when using 33-or 65-line densities. In vivo optical imaging of ATP release after limb CEU demonstrated a trend for greater ATP signal with longer pulse duration. The highest signal was observed with high line density and long pulse duration condition (Figure 4). ATP release data taken in context of changes in blood flow, however, reveal that ATP release may not be linearly related to changes in blood flow, and instead there is likely to be a threshold response. FLOW AUGMENTATION IN HUMANS. Mean age for healthy volunteers was 38 AE 11 years; demographic and clinical data for study patients with PAD are presented in Table 1. In healthy control subjects, resting perfusion at baseline was similar between legs (Figure 5). After 10 min exposure to continuous US alone, there were no significant changes in perfusion in the US-exposed or contralateral limb. On a separate day, US cavitation of MBs produced on average a 2.5fold increase in muscle perfusion, which completely resolved by 1 h. Modest flow augmentation was also observed in the contralateral calf, although this change did not reach statistical significance. In patients with PAD, baseline perfusion was not substantially different between calves and MB cavitation produced on average a >2-fold increase in tissue perfusion, which did not completely return to baseline at 1 h. Again, a modest but statistically insignificant increase in muscle perfusion was seen in the contralateral leg.

These studies are planned in the course of evaluating the effect of rastered elevational planes, which is possible with the 3-D array probe used in our preclinical portion of this study. Neither MB dose-response nor time-response were tested. Instead, we elected to evaluate dosing strategies that conformed to Food and Drug Administration-approved limits and to use US durations in humans that are effective in mice and in the subjects with sickle cell disease(5). Because we studied patients with claudication in whom resting blood flow by CEU was not substantially impaired, we did not evaluate changes in symptoms. Webelieve that evaluation of clinical effects should be performed once full optimization is complete and large-volume tissue exposure with the optimized system is possible. Studies in PAD subjects instead were intended to evaluate changes in microvascular tone in the clinical setting of atherosclerosis and comorbidities such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS This study we have examined acoustic variables that are important for optimizing flow augmentation with CEU and can be implemented using current clinical scanning technology. We have also demonstrated that MB cavitation can produce regional flow augmentation that can be achieved in normal subjects and patients with PAD despite using a very limited spatial extent of exposure. Further clinical translation will require modifications in transducer technology, scanning schemes, and possibly contrast agent composition that will permit large-volume therapy and longer duration of effect. T herapeutic focused ultrasound offers a noninvasive approach to targeted delivery of ablative acoustic energy to structures within the body. High-intensity focused ultrasound is one form of therapeutic ultrasound that capitalizes on the conversion of focused acoustic energy into thermal energy to injure target tissues, such as currently used for cancer (1) and essential tremor (2). Harnessing the bioeffects of ultrasound for therapeutic purposes has more recently been explored in conjunction with diagnostic ultrasound contrast agents, which comprise gas-filled shell-encapsulated microspheres (microbubbles). Several of these microbubbles are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use as red cell tracers for left ventricular cavity opacification during echocardiography, liver imaging, and evaluation of vesicoureteral reflux (3). Microbubbles compress and expand (oscillate or cavitate) in response to the cycles of ultrasound. In so doing, the microbubbles focus the energy of the ultrasound wave (wavelength on the order of millimeters) to a space on the order of magnitude of microns, leading to highly localized, often high, shear stress and/or microbubble destruction through inertial cavitation. It would not be hard to imagine that flowing microbubbles vibrating within the microcirculation could confer biophysical consequences. Indeed, recognition of such effects has fueled exciting efforts to leverage the unique acoustic behaviors of microbubbles for therapeutic gain.

Thus, line density (number of lines of ultrasound transmitted within one ultrasound frame) and pulse duration and configuration (number of ultrasound cycles and distribution of cycles in a particular line, respectively) of the therapeutic frame were systematically varied. It was premised that line density affects how much ultrasound a given microbubble at a given location would \"feel\" over time. High line density results in greater spatial overlap in the ultrasound field and therefore greater total ultrasound exposure per microbubble, and low line density causes \"gaps\" or regions of lower peak ultrasound pressure. Accordingly, 3 line densities were tested: 17 (low), 33 (medium), and 65 (high) lines per frame. For each line of ultrasound, 5 cycles (short pulse), 5 cycles \u00c2 8 times, or 40 consecutive cycles (long pulse) were delivered. Treatment was given to the nonischemic hindlimb of mice, then skeletal muscle perfusion (as measured with contrast ultrasound) and ATP levels after treatment were compared to those values in the contralateral leg. Although reporting perfusion preand post-UTMC would have been ideal and the derivation of peak intensity (A-value) would have been useful as an indicator of tissue blood volume response, it was concluded that compared to the contralateral leg, UTMC augmented perfusion (red cell flux rate) in the treated leg \"most consistently\" at the high line density. It is notable that at high line density, the magnitude of flow augmentation was the same whether short or long pulses were delivered. Moreover, although the 3 line densities were not compared head to head, Figure 3 shows that with long pulse length, the degree of flow augmentation was the same regardless of line density. These data suggest that, for the ultrasound frequency and acoustic power tested, pulse duration does not matter if the line density is high enough, and line density does not matter if the pulse duration is long enough: the degree of flow augmentation is similar.",

Yet, why was ATP expression more than an order of magnitude different between conditions despite similar degrees of consequent hyperemia? Also notable was the brevity of the hyperemic effect of UTMC in humans compared to that in mice. Are other mechanisms involved beyond ATP release that could better explain the time course difference? How can the therapeutic effect be more sustained to truly become clinically useful? Such questions highlight how much more we need to understand about the mechanisms underlying the targeted bioeffects of UTMC, not just in limb flow augmentation but in other therapeutic applications such as those described above.

Anatomic abnormalities in the aortic valve (more prominent in the bicuspid and less prominent in the tricuspid aortic valve) certainly play an important role. Stiff aorta related to aging, risk factors, and atherosclerosis are other factors that may contribute to the development of calcific AS. In addition, studies using magnetic resonance imaging techniques have shown different blood flow patterns in the root of the aorta in various disorders and diseases. For example, turbulent blood flow in the root of the aorta has shown to be present in the elderly (6). Other studies have demonstrated that the first abnormalities in AS were observed on the side of the aortic valve leaflets where turbulent blood flow occurs (3). It is also known that valvular and vascular calcifications are inversely related to mineral density of the bones (Figure 1). Several disorders and diseases that affect mineral metabolism in the bones, such as osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, Paget disease, and others, are associated with valvular calcification (7). In this issue of iJACC, Ramchand et al. (2) investigated another factor that likely involves the pathogenesis and progression of AS and aortic valve calcification. The authors studied the interrelationship between plasma converting enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE2) activity and aortic valve calcification, severity of AS, and myocardial remodeling and fibrosis in 127 patients with AS.

Moreover, although largescale studies have provided meaningful reference values and standards for analysis of cardiac volumes and EF (6,7), such studies are absent for the remaining biomarkers. As a result, the use of these advanced markers in clinical practice has so far been limited. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) algorithms show great promise for the automation of CMR analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved previously unmatched accuracy in many image analysis challenges (8). Using CNNs, a wide set of cardiac functional parameters could potentially be obtained automatically from CMR. Several groups have shown that CNNs can provide accurate enddiastolic and end-systolic cardiac segmentations from CMR in preselected images (9-11). Although these results have gained significant attention, the practical implementation of DL algorithms in clinical practice and research is hindered by a lack of appropriate quality control (QC). Variable image quality, image artefacts, and unusual anatomic variations (not seen during training) are unavoidable in clinical imaging, and can result in significant errors if such images are analyzed automatically. Therefore, robust QC measures to detect (potential) erroneous output are a prerequisite to the translation of DL algorithms into clinical practice (12).We aim to address this issue by developing a pipeline for comprehensive analysis of cardiac function (cardiac volumes, filling and ejection dynamics and myocardial strain) that includes robust QC mechanisms, which allows for automated cine CMR analysis without clinician oversight.

Motion artefacts do not result in static distortion of the image, which is easily recognized in post-analysis QC. Instead, the dynamic motion of the heart is affected due to incorporation of information from unrepresentative motion states (arrhythmias or mistriggering) or through-and in-plane motion (breathing artefacts). Similar to off-axis planning, these artefacts can have a significant impact on the computed parameters. In QC2, we used a wide range of relevant criteria to evaluate the output of our pipeline, including clinical knowledge (similarity between LV and RV SV), anatomical relations (coverage of segmentations and images in LAX and SAX) and DL algorithms. This design ensured that erroneous and/or anomalous outputs were detected independent of their nature, even in cases not anticipated during development of the algorithms. This generalization facilitates implementation of the pipeline in clinical scenarios, such as large research databases or clinical practice, where the image quality and disease are not known a priori. Techniques for automated QC have been previously proposed, such as motion artefact detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging (20), image quality evaluation in fetal (21) and cardiac (22) ultrasound, and detection of missing slices (23), off-axis planning (24), or segmentation errors (25) in CMR.

Can these complexities be overcome such that machine learning solutions can be used in a routine clinical environment? Theoretically, yes. In this issue of iJACC, Ruijsink et al. (5) describe an automated framework for cardiac function analysis from cine CMR images that provides quantitative measurements of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) volumes and ejection fraction, as well as regional myocardial strain in the longitudinal, circumferential, and radial directions. Their approach is based on convolutional neural networks, which have recently demonstrated significant utility in a variety of machine learning applications. A particular strength of the approach taken by Ruijsink et al. is their systematic use of quality control (QC) steps at the pre-and post-analysis stages (QC1 and QC2, respectively). The goal of QC1 is to reject poor-quality images, such as those for which the patient failed to hold their breath. QC2 seeks to reject solutions that are physiologically impossible and flag them for human inspection and correction. All machine learning models must first be trained. Ruijsink et al. (5) created training data in 100 patients by manually tracing the myocardial endocardial and epicardial borders, as well as by manually performing regional strain analyses, and used this manually generated data to train the convolutional neural networks. The trained model was then run across these 100 patients, and Figures 1 and 2 in Ruijsink et al.

It seems likely, however, that the per-patient time needed for physician review of the 700 automated analyses was far shorter than the time needed for manual contouring in the other group of 100 patients. If so, perhaps a key goal has already been achieved: saving physician time. Beyond the goal of \"fast\" lies the more important issue of \"diagnostically correct.\" Atrial septal defect is a relatively common disease in which blood \"leaks\" between the left and right chambers of the heart. In QC2, Ruijsink et al. (5) defined failure as a >10% difference between LV and RV stroke volume, a threshold likely to be exceeded in at least some atrial septal defect patients. Similarly, patients with regurgitation of the aortic or pulmonic valve would likely also fail QC2. Although the assumption of equal LV and RV stroke volumes may be reasonable for this early stage study of machine learning, the likelihood that commonly encountered patient populations would systematically fail automated analysis underscores that success will be considerably more difficult in a realistic clinical environment.

SEX DIFFERENCES IN LV REMODELING AND EXTENT OF MYOCARDIAL FIBROSIS. Several studies have reported sex-related differences in the LV response to pressure overload (34-38). The current study provides further evidence to support the fundamental difference in LV remodeling between women and men with AS. Indeed, despite similar AS severity and LV global hemodynamic load, as well as a more favorable cardiovascular risk profile, women presented with lower indexed LV mass but paradoxically a larger extent of diffuse myocardial fibrosis (ECV) and a similar amount of replacement myocardial fibrosis (LGE) (Central Illustration). Moreover, after comprehensive multivariable analyses, female sex remained an important independent determinant of higher ECV fraction and LGE. It is worth noting that the greater expansion of ECV fraction observed in women was also accompanied by higher estimated LV",

The noninvasive assessment of the expansion and pattern of myocardial fibrosis by CMR imaging could help to determine the optimal timing of aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with severe AS. Future studies are needed to determine whether an earlier intervention based on the extent of diffuse fibrosis may be associated with better outcomes in these patients. However, the results of the current study suggest that women may develop a greater extent of diffuse fibrosis than men independently of the degree of stenosis severity. This finding could, at least in part, explain the increased risk of cardiac mortality after aortic valve intervention observed in women in a recent large CMR prospective study(51).Further studies are still needed to determine whether larger expansion of diffuse myocardial fibrosis (as measured by T1 mapping using CMR imaging) could be a potential trigger for early valve replacement in women with severe AS.STUDY LIMITATIONS. The current study is a crosssectional analysis and thus has inherent limitations related to this type of design; the findings must be confirmed by further studies with a longitudinal design. In addition, this study was not a prespecified analysis from our 2 prospective studies. The rationale for this study is, however, supported by recent evidence suggesting substantial sex-related differences in the pathophysiology of AS(37,(52)(53)(54). The CMR examinations were performed with scanners from different vendors, and there were some minor differences in the acquisition protocols. Moreover, the areas of infarction were excluded from LGE analysis by 1 center and included by the other. However, these limitations did not affect the main findings of this study. Furthermore, an analysis stratified according to center revealed that the results with respect to the sex differences in LV remodeling and fibrosis were similar in the 2 centers, which indirectly supports the generalizability of the results of this study.",

Further investigations are necessary to answer the following questions. Do all patients with AS need to have CMR imaging for evaluating fibrosis? If yes, when? If not, how else can patients with significant myocardial fibrosis be identified? Can echocardiography (strain imaging and/or diastolic function assessment) or other laboratory data be used instead? How can we best define \"severe\" AS; that is, severe enough to benefit from AVR? Which type of AVR (surgical vs. transcatheter) provides better outcomes in asymptomatic patients with significant myocardial fibrosis? This study by Tastet et al. (7) reports not only the sex difference in reaction to AS but also the importance of sex-and age-related intrinsic changes of the myocardium. It is hoped that multimodality imaging can help determine the optimal timing of AVR by detecting the threshold level of myocardial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction.

In addition, we investigated whether fully quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion is superior to semiquantitative and visual analysis.BACKGROUND The agreement between CMR and FFR in the evaluation of nonculprit lesions in patients with STEMI with multivessel disease is unknown.METHODS Seventy-seven patients with STEMI with at least 1 intermediate (diameter stenosis 50% to 90%) nonculprit lesion underwent CMR and invasive coronary angiography in conjunction with FFR measurements at 1 month after primary intervention. The imaging protocol included stress and rest perfusion, cine imaging, and late gadolinium enhancement. Fully quantitative, semiquantitative, and visual analysis of myocardial perfusion were compared against a reference of FFR. Hemodynamically obstructive was defined as FFR #0.80. RESULTS Hemodynamically obstructive nonculprit lesions were present in 31 (40%) patients. Visual analysis displayed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62 to 0.83), with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 70%. For semiquantitative analysis, the relative upslope of the stress signal intensity time curve and the relative upslope derived myocardial flow reserve had respective AUCs of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54 to 0.77) and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.81). Fully quantitative analysis did not augment diagnostic performance (all p > 0.05). Stress myocardial blood flow displayed an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64 to 0.85), with a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 77%. Similarly, MFR displayed an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71 to 0.90), with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 71%. CONCLUSIONS CMR and FFR have moderate-good agreement in the evaluation of nonculprit lesions in patients with STEMI with multivessel disease. Fully quantitative, semiquantitative, and visual analysis yield similar diagnostic performance. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2020;13:715-28) \u00a9 2020 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation. O ver the past few decades, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has emerged as a robust tool to evaluate patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Among the myriad of imaging techniques, CMR has the advantages of being cost-effective (1), widely available, and multiparametric (i.e., it allows to evaluate several pathological features during a single session). In addition, CMR does not expose patients to ionizing radiation while permitting imaging at high spatial resolution. Finally, patients with normal CMR results have a reassuring low risk of future cardiovascular events (2). In the clinical setting, perfusion images are typically assessed visually; however, CMR can also quantify myocardial blood flow (MBF) in relative (semiquantitative) (3) and even absolute terms (fully quantitative) (4). Conflicting evidence exists as to whether quantification improves the diagnostic accuracy of perfusion CMR. Although some studies reported superiority of fully quantitative analysis over semiquantitative and visual analysis (5), others found no benefit of quantification in the diagnosis of obstructive CAD (6-8). In patients with stable CAD, invasive measurements of fractional flow reserve (FFR) are considered the optimal index for diagnosing hemodynamically obstructive CAD and guiding revascularization (9). Although CMR and FFR are reported to have a high concordance in the assessment of patients with stable CAD (10), the agreement between CMR and FFR in the evaluation of nonculprit lesions after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is still unknown.",

This is a substudy of data from patients enrolled in the REDUCE-MVI (Reducing Micro Vascular Dysfunction in Acute Myocardial Infarction by Ticagrelor) trial in the Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc. The main results of this trial have been published previously (13). Briefly, patients with a first STEMI and at least 1 intermediate lesion in a nonculprit vessel were enrolled after successful revascularization of the culprit. Intermediate was defined as 50% to 90% diameter stenosis. The main exclusion criteria were cardiogenic shock, decompensated heart failure, left main disease, and chronic total occlusion. Acute STEMI management and subsequent medical care followed contemporary guidelines (14). Follow-up CMR and invasive assessment were scheduled 1 month after the index event. CMR always preceded invasive assessment. Patients were instructed to refrain from products containing caffeine or xanthine for 24 h before the follow-up visit. To evaluate angina burden, patients completed the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) upon arrival at the hospital (15). The study protocol was approved by the institutional review committee of the Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc. All patients gave written informed consent. CMR IMAGE ACQUISITION. All images were obtained on a 1.5-T clinical scanner (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). Perfusion imaging was performed using a dual-sequence technique (16). High-resolution images of myocardial perfusion were acquired using an echo planar made available by the Top Sector Life Sciences & Health to stimulate public-private partnerships.

To assess the arterial input function, low-resolution turboFLASH images were acquired at the basal level using a sequence optimized for the high gadolinium concentration. Perfusion images were obtained every heartbeat for 50 to 70 cardiac cycles following intravenous injection of a 0.075 mmol/kg bolus of a gadoliniumbased contrast agent (DOTAREM, Guerbet, Villepinte, France). In-plane respiratory motion of the heart was corrected using a nonrigid registration (17). Perfusion images were corrected for surface coil induced inhomogeneities through a separate prescan normalization (18). Typical in-plane resolution of the myocardial perfusion images was 2.5 \u00c2 2.5 mm, with a slice thickness of 10 mm (prepulse 90 , repetition time 5.6 ms, echo time 1.1 ms, saturation time 110 ms, flip angle 18 , matrix 144 \u00c2 160). Stress was induced by continuous infusion of adenosine at 140 mg/kg/min through a second venous cannula, started 2 min before image acquisition. Rest perfusion images were obtained 15 min after stress imaging using identical scanning parameters and slice location. Cardiac function was assessed in between stress and rest perfusion with steady-state free-precession cine imaging. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was performed 12 to 15 min after rest perfusion using a 2-dimensional segmented inversion-recovery gradient-echo pulse sequence. CMR IMAGE ANALYSIS. Perfusion images were analyzed using dedicated research software (MASS version 2017-Exp, Leiden, the Netherlands). Cine and LGE images were analyzed using commercially available software (QMASS version 7.6, Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands). The myocardium was divided into 16 segments (true apex not included), which were allocated to vascular territories using anatomic information from the invasive angiogram. In addition to this modified segmentation, myocardial segments were allocated to vascular territories according to the standard segmentation model of the American Heart Association (19). Visual analysis of perfusion images was performed by consensus of 2 expert observers (R.N. and R.L.). First, quality of the images was graded as 0 (not assessable), 1 (poor), 2 (moderate), or 3 (good). Next, the occurrence of splenic switch-off was visually assessed by comparing the rest and stress perfusion images. Thereafter, perfusion was scored per segment as 0 (normal), 1 (mildly abnormal), or 2 (severely abnormal). LGE images were reviewed alongside perfusion images to evaluate hyperenhancement. The transmural extent of hyperenhancement was scored per segment as: 0 (absent)of the individual segments. Because the region of hyperenhancement resulting from the recent STEMI may exceed the segments allocated to the culprit (20), all hyperenhanced segments were excluded provided that the hyperenhancement was clearly related to the index event. Segments with hyperenhancement according to a nonischemic pattern were also excluded (21); thus, segments in nonculprit vascular territories with incidental hyperenhancement were only included if the hyperenhancement was clearly unrelated to the index event and demonstrated an ischemic pattern. Semiand fully quantitative analysis of perfusion were performed by a single observer (H.E.), supervised by a second observer (R.N.). Endocardial and epicardial contours were manually drawn on the basal, mid, and apical slices of both the stress and rest perfusion series. A region of interest was placed in the blood pool of the perfusion series obtained for the arterial input function. Semiquantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion was performed by calculating the relative upslope of the signal intensity time curve, as described previously (3). Fully quantitative analysis was performed by Fermi function constrained deconvolution of the signal intensity time curves according to previously described methods (4). Myocardial flow reserve (MFR) was calculated as the ratio of stress to rest perfusion parameters. Perfusion in myocardium subtended by a nonculprit vessel was calculated by averaging 2 adjacent segments with the lowest perfusion values in the vascular territory of the nonculprit vessel. In an additional analysis,perfusion was calculated by averaging the entire vascular territory of the nonculprit vessel. Remote myocardium was defined as the myocardial segments vascularized by a nonculprit vessel with <50% diameter stenosis. LV end-diastolic volume, endsystolic volume, and ejection fraction were calculated from the cine images. Infarct size was calculated from the LGE images using the full width at half maximum method. Additionally, the LGE images were evaluated for presence of microvascular obstruction. All CMR analyses were performed blinded to clinical information, coronary angiography results, and data obtained from invasive measurements. FOLLOW-UP INVASIVE CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY AND PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERROGATION. A guiding catheter was advanced into the coronary ostium of the stenotic nonculprit vessel. After regular coronary 200 mg of nitrates were administered as an intracoronary bolus. A pressure/temperature sensor-tipped guidewire (PressureWire X wired, Abbott, Chicago, Illinois) was placed in the distal part of the stenotic nonculprit vessel and connected to the RadiAnalyzer interface (Abbott). Next, hyperemia was induced through intravenous infusion of adenosine using the same protocol as applied during CMR. FFR was obtained after at least 2 min of infusion. Lesions with FFR #0.80 were regarded as hemodynamically obstructive. Lesions with $90% diameter stenosis",

Their worse prognosis is possibly associated with additional plaque instability, impaired epicardial and microvascular myocardial perfusion, and cardiogenic shock. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been shown to improve prognosis in acute STEMI, yet nonculprit lesions identified during acute MI may be overestimated because of vasospasm, hemodynamic instability, and concurrent infusion of vasoactive substances (1). Targeted revascularization of prognostically important nonculprit lesions is therefore potentially attractive from patient outcome and cost-effectiveness perspectives. Fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided PCI is considered the gold standard for the prognostic management of intermediate lesions in stable angina but requires maximal hyperemia and is comparatively time consuming. Establishing the diagnostic performance of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in this scenario could be seen as a valid first step, given the superior performance of stress perfusion CMR compared with other noninvasive imaging modalities in stable angina and its noninferiority compared with FFR (2). In this issue of iJACC, Everaars et al. (3) report moderate-to-good agreement of same-day adenosine stress perfusion CMR with invasive measurements of FFR a month following primary PCI for acute STEMI in 77 patients with nonculprit stenoses. The accuracy of visual, semiquantitative, and fully quantitative assessment of stress CMR did not differ significantly. In principle, acute microvascular dysfunction (from thrombus or leukocyte plugs, hemorrhage, microcirculatory compression, and neurohumoral vasoconstriction) could extend into nonculprit territory. This might limit maximal hyperemia with adenosine, resulting in higher FFR, particularly in large infarcts. To address this, Everaars et al. (3) measured thermodilution-derived coronary flow reserve and index of microcirculatory resistance in a subset of patients (68% of the nonculprit stenosed vessels) to identify any persisting microvascular dysfunction as a confounder of stress-perfusion accuracy. Did stress CMR underperform when compared with the stable angina setting? The areas under the curve (AUC) here were reported to be 0.74 (visual), 0.66 for stress-relative upslope, and 0.71 for relative upslopederived myocardial flow reserve (semiquantitative), and stress myocardial blood flow and myocardial flow reserve of 0.76 and 0.82 (fully quantitative). In contrast, a 15-study meta-analysis of diagnostic stress CMR accuracy in stable angina quoted an overall AUC against FFR in 1,830 vessels of 0.95 (4). Well-conducted comparisons of FFR and stress CMR in this group of patients remain limited. Stress CMR at 1.5-T in a smaller STEMI cohort was previously referenced against quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) rather than FFR. Diagnostic accuracy of semiquantitative analysis was superior, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 86% (5",

Although trials in patients with low prevalence of disease have not been able to demonstrate differences(2), the question has less frequently been studied in patients with high prevalence of disease or known disease, such as patients after previous revascularization. Anatomical imaging of the coronary arteries using computed tomography angiography (CTA) has a very high negative predictive value in patients with low burden of disease, which is the main reason for its recommendation as an early test to rule out disease. In contrast, cases of patients with known or previously revascularized cor-onary artery disease are significantly more complex, challenging the role of noninvasive coronary artery imaging. These challenges are a higher calcium score in patients with risk factors or expressed disease, a larger percentage of intermediate stenosis with unknown hemodynamic significance, more stents or bypass vessels with complex anastomoses, a higher prevalence of previous myocardial infarction, and a higher burden of cardiac arrhythmia in patients with coronary artery disease. Most of these factors have a significant potential to reduce the accuracy of coronary artery imaging as well as computed tomography based fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) but, except for previous myocardial infarction, have less or no influence on the direct measurement of myocardial perfusion. Assessment of myocardial perfusion has been a domain of nuclear imaging for decades; however, more recently, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has high accuracy, strong prognostic value, and the ability to reduce unnecessary catheterization (3). In a randomized clinical effectiveness trial (MR-INFORM [Myocardial Perfusion CMR versus Angiography and Fractional Flow Reserve to Guide the Management of Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease]), perfusion CMR was compared to invasive angiography and FFR to guide patient management, resulting in a lower rate of revascularization with similar outcome (4). These data pose perfusion CMR at the forefront of the workup of patients with intermediate to high pre-test likelihoods. Perfusion CT has struggled to find its place in the clinical routine for a number of reasons. Technical limitations required imaging several heart beats to obtain full coverage of the myocardium. On the other hand, perfusion CT found itself in direct competition with CT-FFR, which can be applied to regular CT angiograms without the need for additional imaging, as well as with perfusion CMR, which is free from ionizing radiation, does not require iodinated contrast agents, provides a better temporal resolution, and informs of the presence of previous myocardial infarction. In this issue of iJACC, Andreini et al. (5) assess an important niche area, the use of perfusion CT in patients with suspected in-stent restenosis. They assessed 163 patients who had previously undergone stent implantation and had indications for invasive angiography. Thirteen patients were excluded due to previous myocardial infarction (n \u00bc 4), contraindication to adenosine (n \u00bc 4), impaired renal function (n \u00bc 3), and body mass index (n \u00bc 2).

Therefore, the addition of physiological measurements such as the fractional flow reserve (FFR) are now recommended by current guidelines for revascularization decision making (3,4) because they indeed demonstrated an improved event-free survival (1,5). It should be noted, however, that antiplatelet therapy was unequally allocated and the difference was mainly driven by (urgent) revascularization because of refractory angina.

Coronary artery calcium score was calculated according to the Agatston scoring system using Agatston units. Per vessel plaque volume was quantified automatically within manually designated regions of atherosclerotic plaque. Coronary lesions were also analyzed for 4 highrisk atherosclerotic plaque characteristics that have been described as predictors of worse outcome(10,21). The remodeling index was computed as the ratio of vessel area at the site of the maximal lesion to that of a proximal reference point, with an index >1.1 representing positive remodeling (PR)(12).Low attenuation plaque (LAP) was defined as a plaque containing any voxel <30 HU(12). Spotty calcification (SC) was characterized by a calcified plaque comprising <90 of the vessel circumference and <3 mm in length(12).

This is supported by previous and current findings of morphological plaque features as independent predictors for hyperemic hemodynamic repercussions(12)(13)(14).Although traditionally hyperemia is induced in the hemodynamic evaluation of lesions and subsequent revascularization decision making, iFR has recently emerged as an adenosine-free alternative(22). Two important randomized controlled trials recently reported that iFR guidance and FFR guidance resulted in a similar composite outcome of death, MI, and urgent revascularization(17,18). Although the study populations were remarkably large, the number of adverse events at 1-year follow-up were limited and driven by urgent revascularization. A pooled analysis of these data, however, revealed a numerical excess of death and MI in the iFR group which was not statistically significant and, therefore, hypothesis generating(19). As such, it remained unclear whether non-hyperemic assessment with iFR is associated with plaque vulnerability similar to FFR and became the impetus for the current substudy. For the other 2indices that were tested in the present study, Pd/Pa and iFRa, there was no prognostic data available.HIGH-RISK ATHEROSCLEROTICPLAQUES. Early pathological studies demonstrated that ruptured plaques were responsible for most fatal MIs(29) andled to the concept of so-called vulnerable plaques. These plaques are characterized by large lipid-rich cores, a myriad of inflammatory cells, and a thin fibrous cap(8,9). Due to recent advances, atherosclerotic plaque morphology can now be assessed in vivo with invasive and non-invasive imaging techniques(9,30). In this way, the prospective PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to StudyPredictors of Events in the Coronary Tree) studyshowed that lesion-related risk factors derived from intravascular ultrasound included small luminal area, thin-cap fibroatheromas, and large plaque burden(31). Plaques with these 3 adverse characteristics demonstrated a 18.2% likelihood of causing a major adverse cardiovascular event within a 3-year followup, while it should be noted that most events were rehospitalizations for unstable or progressive angina. Likewise, several plaque features derived from coronary CT have been identified as being high-risk for adverse events beyond stenosis severity (10,11,21). Especially large lipid-rich (low-attenuation on CT) and positively remodeled plaques were associated with the highest event rate of 22.5% within 2 years (10), as opposed to patients free of both high-risk plaque features, who had a very low risk of acute events (<0.5%) (10). Because the aforementioned studies did not include functional measures of atherosclerosis, the present results might partially fill this gap, even though in turn clinical outcome was currently not available.

Total coronary pressure drop is defined by the sum of the viscous friction along the entrance of a lesion, and losses induced by convective acceleration along the lesion. Both effects increase congruent with coronary flow. These local pressure losses are not recovered at the lesion exit due to flow separation and eddy formation (32). It is, therefore, advised to position the pressure wire as distal to the stenosis as technically feasible (33). Possibly, the morphology of high-risk plaques might have an incremental impact on such pressure losses, especially during hyperemia. This is less the case for resting indices and nonexisting for non-invasive myocardial perfusion imaging. As can be appreciated from Figure 2 and in line with previous reports (14), adverse plaque characteristics seem to have a greater impact on hyperemic intracoronary pressure measures than myocardial blood flow. High-risk plaque morphology is also described to be associated with altered wall shear stress patterns and might affect coronary pressure with greater magnitude in a hyperemic state with maximal flow than in a resting state. Another proposed mechanism of high-risk plaques and abnormal FFR, beyond luminal stenosis, refers to local inability of lipid-rich plaques to dilate at the time of maximal hyperemia (15). Either as a direct result of impaired response to vasodilatory agents or as an indirect effect of increased flow (34), these stenotic vascular segments might show relatively limited vasodilation as compared with unaffected segments. This is possibly owing to a maximally stretched diseased vessel similar to the Glagovian limit (35). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS. The present results show an interaction between plaque morphology and hyperemic pressure-derived indices of coronary stenosis. As such, atherosclerotic plaques prone for plaque rupture might be less likely to be detected with nonhyperemic pressure indices.",

            "text": "flow reserve (FFR) derived from diagnostic cCTA (CT-FFR) using computational fluid dynamics modeling has been validated against invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with FFR for the detection of lesion-specific ischemia(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14). Recently, a simplified prototype algorithm was developed based on a machine-learning method that uses an artificial intelligence algorithm with computational learning to compute the functional severity of a lesion(15)(16)(17). This approach has also been validated against invasively measured FFR in a multicenter registry(18). Both technical solutions involve prior segmentation of the vessel lumen from the contrast enhanced data set before the FFR algorithms aredeployed. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score affects important components of the FFR calculation: the identification of the vessel lumen and the course of the artery. Yet, limited data from a single study suggested maintained superior diagnostic performance of CT-FFR based on computational fluid dynamics modeling over cCTA, regardless of the overall Agatston score (19). However, the effect of CAC score on the diagnostic performance of the recently introduced machine-learning algorithm requires further investigation. Thus, we sought to investigate the effect of CAC score on the diagnostic performance of machine-learning-based CT-FFR derivation. METHODS STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION. The rationale and design of the MACHINE registry has been previously described by Coenen et al. (18). Briefly, the MACHINE consortium is a collaboration between 5 institutions in North America, Europe, and Asia that investigates the performance of machinelearning-based CT-FFR compared to cCTA to assess lesion-specific ischemia using invasive FFR as the reference standard in a population suspected of having CAD. Institutional review board approval was obtained at each participating center. Patients were prospectively enrolled at 1 center (20) and retrospectively included based on the availability of both cCTA and invasive FFR data at the 4 other sites (11,12,21,22). Of the 417 patients who initially qualified, 314 patients with 482 vessels were included in the study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and patient demographics are described in greater detail by Coenen et al. (18) cCTA IMAGE ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS.Imaging was performed using a firstor secondgeneration dual-source CT system (SOMATOM Definition or SOMATOM Definition Flash, SiemensHealthineers, Forchheim, Germany). For the noncontrast-enhanced calcium scoring study, a prospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered acquisition at 55% to 65% of the RR interval with 3-mm section thickness was performed. For the subsequent contrast-enhanced cCTA, a retrospectively ECG-gated protocol or a prospectively ECG-triggered sequential protocol was performed.

            "text": "radiation dose was estimated by multiplying the dose-length-product with a standard conversion factor of 0.014 mSv/mGy$cm(25), resulting in a mean effective radiation dose equivalent of 8.3 AE 6.0 mSv CT-FFR ANALYSIS. For the CT-FFR analysis, a machine-learning-based research prototype (Siemens cFFR, Version 2.1, Siemens, not currently commercially available) was used as previously described(11,12). The software resides on-site on a standarddesktop computer workstation and allows for the physician-driven creation of a patient-specific anatomical model of the coronary tree using a semiautomatic approach. CT-FFR values were computed using a recently introduced machine-learning algorithm (15). This approach is based on a deep learning framework to determine the functional severity of the lesion. The deep learning algorithm uses a multilayer neural network architecture that was trained offline to learn the complex relationship between the anatomy of the coronary tree and its corresponding hemodynamics. The machine-learning algorithm was trained using 12,000 synthetic 3-dimensional (3D) coronary models of various anatomies with known characteristics (vessel maximal and minimal diameter, lesions length, degree of tapering, branch angulation, and so on). These synthetically generated models were then used to further train the artificial intelligence by comparing them to their corresponding hemodynamic conditions as determined via more traditional computational fluid dynamics simulation. This method was previously validated against the computational fluid dynamics algorithm using an independent database of 87 patient-specific anatomical models derived from cCTA in comparison with invasive FFR as the reference standard (15). Based on geometric features of the individual patient's coronary anatomy on cCTA, the algorithm uses the previously learned relationships to calculate the machine learned CT-FFR values. For any point available within the coronary tree, a machine-learned CT-FFR value is generated by computing the ratio of the average local pressure over a cardiac cycle to the average aortic pressure. This results in a color-coded 3D mesh allowing for the determination of the machinelearned CT-FFR value at arbitrary locations. To coregister the correct location of a coronary lesion on cCTA images and 3D CT-FFR coronary meshes, the 18-segment coronary artery model was used (26). Functionally significant CAD was defined as machinelearned CT-FFR #0.80 (11). ICA WITH FFR MEASUREMENT. ICA was performed by experienced interventional cardiologists according to local standards. Invasive FFR measurement was either performed for clinical reasons or for unrelated research purposes. An FFR pressure wire was positioned distal to the stenosis of interest and hyperemia was induced by continuous administration of intravenous adenosine (140 mg /kg/min). FFR values #0.80 were considered hemodynamically significant. To coregister the location of invasive FFR measurement and CT-FFR, an independent observer without knowledge of angiographic or functional results identified the invasive FFR sample location on fluoroscopy images and registered the corresponding location as an anatomical landmark on the cCTA images.

Effect of image quality on diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive fractional flow reserve: coronary artery disease, coronary computed tomography angiography, computational fractional flow reserve, invasive coronary angiography APPENDIX For additional case examples, please see the online version of this paper. computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have enabled patient-specific modeling of coronary blood flow and pressure from standard CTA images, without the need for additional imaging or medication (2). Based on this technique, noninvasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) derived from CTA can identify lesion-specific ischemia by invasive coronary angiography (ICA)-derived FFR, as shown in several clinical trials (3-5). Nevertheless, CFD models are complex; involve multiple finely calibrated geometric, hemodynamic, and material parameters; and may require long computation times (6). To address this limitation, Itu et al. (7) developed a machine-learning (ML)-based approach for calculating CT-FFR on-site at standard workstations. The ML algorithm was trained using a database of 12,000 synthetically generated 3-dimensional coronary anatomies for which the CFD-based CT-FFR values were computed. The CFD-based results formed the ground truth training data for the ML-based CT-FFR model. A deep neural network with 28 geometric input features extracted from the synthetically generated database and 4 hidden layers was used to train the ML-based model. The ML application was then tested on CTA images from 87 patients and demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy compared to invasive FFR. The average computation time was 2.4 AE 0.44 s for the entire coronary tree, thus providing near real-time assessment of FFR (7). Coenen et al. (8) compared the diagnostic performance of this ML-based approach against CFD-based CT-FFR in MACHINE (Machine Learning Based CT Angiography Derived FFR: A Multi-Center Registry) (comprising 351 patients and 525 vessels), with invasive FFR as the reference standard. ML-based (area under curve [AUC]: 0.84) and CFD-based CT-FFR (0.84) outperformed visual CTA assessment (0.69; p < 0.001), with no significant difference between the two. The diagnostic accuracy per vessel improved from 58% (54% to 63%) for CTA to 78% (75% to 82%) by adding ML-based CT-FFR. Despite technical advances in CTA resulting in improved temporal and spatial resolution (9), extensive coronary artery calcium (CAC) remains perhaps its greatest challenge in the assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) (10). The presence of extensive coronary calcification can often lead to overestimation of stenosis severity (11). A meta-analysis of 1,634 patients from 19 studies that examined the influence of CAC on the diagnostic performance of CTA showed a significant decline in the specificity of CTA to 42% (28% to 56%) at CAC scores >400 (12). Extensive CAC also influences accurate segmentation of the vessel lumen, an important component of noninvasive FFR computation. Notwithstanding, a substudy of the NXT (Analysis of Coronary Blood Flow Using CT Angiography: Next Steps) trial by Norgaard et al. (5) found no differences in diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity of CFD-based CT-FFR across study-specific quartiles of CAC scoring, including patients at even the highest quartile with CAC scores ranging from 416 to 3,599.

Flow Reserve) trial showed the superior accuracy of CFD-based CT-FFR over CTA (86% vs. 67%), predominantly due to an increase in specificity (82% vs. 29%) (13). In this issue of iJACC, Tesche et al. (14) report on the impact of CAC on the diagnostic performance of MLbased CT-FFR in a substudy of 314 patients (and 482 vessels) from the MACHINE registry who had available CAC scores from noncontrast CT. Using ML CT-FFR, the authors generated patient-specific 3-dimensional meshes that allowed for determination of the CT-FFR value at any point within the coronary tree. With invasive FFR as reference, 228 vessels in 200 patients had functionally significant coronary stenoses (FFR #0.80). On a per-vessel and per-patient level, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of CT-FFR to detect lesion-specific ischemia were not significantly different across CAC score categories. Per vessel, CT-FFR showed incremental discriminatory power over CTA at both high CAC scores (CAC $400: AUC 0.71 vs. 0.55; p \u00bc 0.04) and low-to-intermediate CAC scores (CAC >0 to <400: AUC 0.86 vs. 0.63; p < 0.001). The performance of CT-FFR declined as CAC score increased, just reaching statistical significance (AUC 0.85 [CAC >0 to <400] vs. 0.71 [CAC $400]; p \u00bc 0.04).These findings demonstrate the high and superior diagnostic performance of ML-based CT-FFR compared to CTA across a wide range of CAC scores in a large patient cohort, lending further support to the potential role of CT-FFR as a gatekeeper to ICA and coronary revascularization. Although currently a research prototype, the ML-based application is highly promising for the delivery of on-site, real-time FFR assessment. Results derived using the ML model, based on geometric features extracted from CTA, are nearly identical to CFD results, with a >80-fold reduction in computation time compared to CFD. Theoretically, the ML-based FFR calculation may be less influenced by CAC compared to CFD modeling, as the ML algorithm incorporates both local and global geometric data, with only 8 of the 28 input features corresponding to luminal stenosis (7). Moreover, the performance of the ML model likely will improve as advancements are made in the CFD model of coronary arterial flow on which it is based, including refined segmentation algorithms with larger cohorts of real-world CTA data. In recent years, ML in cardiovascular imaging has emerged as a powerful tool for risk prediction and decision making (15). An ML model that combined clinical and anatomic CTA data was shown to predict 5-year all-cause mortality better than existing clinical or CTA metrics alone (16). Furthermore, ML-based CT-FFR in the original MACHINE registry study reclassified 62 of 85 (73%) false-positive CTA results (8), which has important implications for risk stratification and subsequent referral to ICA of patients with suspected CAD. As with all developing artificial intelligence technologies, ML-based CT-FFR has limitations. The study by Tesche et al. (14) revealed a reduction in diagnostic performance of the ML model in patients with CAC $400, which also was reflected by the poor correlation between per-vessel ML-based CT-FFR and invasive FFR in this subgroup (r \u00bc 0.35) (14). Certainly, clear thresholds for performing ML-based CT-FFR in the setting of extensive CAC need to be defined before its application in a broad patient population. The extraction of anatomic features from CTA for the ML model also requires considerable time (up to 60 min) (7) and remains the rate-limiting step for on-site CT-FFR at point of care. The present study represents a post hoc analysis of the MACHINE registry data, which were mostly retrospective and included variations in patient selection and study design between centers. In this real-world cohort with a broad range of CAC scores, ML-based CT-FFR improved identification of lesionspecific ischemia even at high CAC scores, with a reduction in performance of CT-FFR with an increase in CAC. Despite the study limitations, Tesche et al. (14) should be commended for their timely work demonstrating the robust diagnostic performance of ML-based CT-FFR in the setting of extensive CAC, the current Achilles heel of coronary CTA. Finally, in a study that randomly assigned patients with suspected CAD to standard or high-resolution CTA, improved CT spatial resolution significantly reduced overestimation of stenosis severity in the setting of calcified plaques and resulted in higher diagnostic accuracy of CTA in comparison to ICA (17). With ongoing advancements in CT technology, the accuracy of coronary tree segmentation and extraction of quantitative measures from CTA are only likely to improve.",

Visual perfusion abnormality for SPECT imaging under stress (short axis, horizontal long axis, and vertical long axis) was assessed as part of the clinical reporting by experienced boardcertified nuclear cardiologists at each site, with knowledge of all available data, including gated functional data and all clinical information according to routine local protocols. Quantitative perfusion and functional results under stress and at rest in available positions (obtained with site-specific quantification software) were integrated for the final visual determination for the clinical report. Clinical reading scores were provided by overall visual assessment as normal, probably normal, equivocal, or abnormal in sites that did not use segmental scoring (13). For sites using the 17-segment model (n \u00bc 13,553) (16,17), the summed stress scores (SSS) were grouped as normal (SSS \u00bc 0), probably normal (SSS \u00bc 1), equivocal (SSS \u00bc 2 to 3), or abnormal (SSS $4) (9). AUTOMATED QUANTIFICATION. All image datasets were de-identified and transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where quality control was performed by experienced core laboratory technologists without having knowledge of clinical data. Automatically generated myocardial contours generated by Quantitative Perfusion SPECT/Quantitative Gated SPECT software (QPS/QGS, Cedars-Sinai MedicalCenter, Los Angeles, California) were evaluated, and when necessary, contours were adjusted to correspond to the myocardium by an experienced core laboratory technologist(13). Stress and rest images were analyzed as previously described by using total perfusion deficit (TPD)(18,19).

The annual hard event rates increased with increases in ischemic TPD category (p < 0.0001) (Supplemental Figure 4) as well as increases in the rest TPD category (p < 0.0001) (Supplemental Figure 5). DISCUSSION FINDINGS FROM THE PRESENT STUDY. In this large multicenter REFINE SPECT registry, it was observed that increasing abnormality in both the visual and the automated perfusion quantifications was associated with increased MACE risk over long-term follow-up (median follow-up of 5 years), in both the unadjusted and the adjusted multivariate analyses. The MACE rates increased with each increasing interval of both visual and quantitative assessments (stress TPD) on a fine granular scale, including several intervals below the standard diagnostic threshold (SSS <4 and stress TPD <5%). These findings were observed similarly in the overall population and in patients with suspected CAD. Importantly, quantitative analysis further stratified risk in a significant number of patients with normal visual perfusion assessment or an SSS of 0. Thus, visual and automated quantitative analyses of MPI are complementary to each other in MACE prediction, providing objective information in addition to the overall visual findings. Concordant findings were also observed for the hard event rates, with the hard event rates smaller (as expected) than MACE rates. OTHER STUDIES. Most previous prognostic SPECT-MPI studies have used only visual perfusion assessments (3-12). A few previous prognostic studies of stress SPECT-MPI have used fully automated quantitative analysis. These quantitative studies were limited by a small sample size or have been singlecenter studies. These previous quantitative studies defined death and myocardial infarction as outcomes (22-24), whereas 2 single-center studies followed MACE over a median term of follow-up (25,26). None of the previous prognostic MPI studies directly compared visual with quantitative analyses. VISUAL VERSUS QUANTITATIVE PERFUSION ASSESSMENT. The results of the present study suggest that both visual and quantitative MPI assessments complement each other for risk stratification.",

This was also true when adjusted for key confounding variables. The 46% of scans read visually as normal, which also had very low quantitative score (TPD <1%) could be assigned better prognosis than that offered by visual reading alone. A meta-analysis of several prognostic studies with visual analysis that evaluated the prognostic value of normal exercise stress SPECT-MPI in 8,008 patients (27) showed a high negative predictive value of MPI. On the basis of these results, it is likely that negative predictive value of a normal MPI could be further refined with the additional quantitative analysis. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS. Although readers use all available information to report their final clinical score, gated scans, and clinical data, the authors have found that MACE and risk of hard events (death and myocardial infarction) can be stratified further by standard quantitative perfusion analysis in cases with normal clinical readings in a significant number of patients. Readers and referring physicians should pay attention to perfusion quantification results, even in cases with subtle defects. The quantitative parameters provide additional independent prediction of the patient's outcome. In the future, one could consider reporting a quantitative probability estimation of annual MACE risk for a given patient. Importantly, the present findings indicate that the concordance of normal visual and quantitative findings can actually lower the MACE risk compared with those read only visually, thus avoiding further costly testing and interventions in some patients. Quantitative perfusion should be incorporated by clinicians as an aid before the final interpretation, even if the overall visual finding is normal. This additional prognostic information available from quantitative analysis can be readily obtained in the large volume of MPI performed worldwide annually. These complementary data do not require any additional patient testing, radiation, procedures, or physician time and should be considered during routine evaluation of patient prognosis.

Because the visual assessment was performed by experienced readers in multiple sites, there could be variability in visual reading among readers from different sites. However, using final visual clinical assessments by local sites, the visual readings represent typical multicenter performance of day-to-day clinical readings in experienced sites. Not all sites performed visual segmental scoring during clinical reporting, reflecting the real-world heterogeneity of the visual reading procedures. Although the SSS was used to categorize qualitative visual assessment classifications for the population that was provided an SSS, the clinical reading score was used for 30% of the population that was not provided an SSS. In a previous study, Abidov et al. (9) has shown that there were some differences in cardiac death rate for the probably normal or equivocal between categorical assessment and SSS, while it was equivalent for normal or abnormal category. Nevertheless, in the current study, 3,971 patients (20% of total study population) who were classified as probably normal or equivocal, only 5% of the patients were classified by categories with the rest (95%) grouped by SSS. The results of the Cox proportional hazards model were limited by the number of events accumulated during the follow-up and by confounders that were put into the models. This study, however, included far more events than any previous multicenter prognostic studies of SPECT-MPI. Although this study used specific standard quantitative approach, it still needs to be established if other software methods and other types of cameras (28,29) would provide similar results. CONCLUSIONS Rates of MACE and hard events (death, myocardial infarction) increased progressively with the worsening of perfusion abnormality among patients undergoing stress MPI according to both visual and quantitative analyses. According to quantitative analysis, annualized MACE and hard event rates increased significantly even for perfusion abnormalities below the diagnostic threshold and even for scans reported as normal. Quantitative analysis provides independent and prognostic information that is complementary to visual reading results.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Readers and referring physicians should pay attention to quantitative parameters, even if overall clinical findings are normal. Perfusion quantification provides additional independent prediction of the patient's outcome. . Miller, MD, a Michael K. O'Connor, PHD b A lthough quantitative techniques for assessing noninvasive and invasive cardiac imaging have been available for years, the cardiology community has been relatively slow to embrace these techniques. The subjective interpretation of images remains the most commonly applied standard in clinical practice. Two parameters that determine the value of cardiac imaging are reproducibility (shooting an arrow multiple times and hitting the same spot on the target) and accuracy (shooting an arrow and hitting the bullseye). For nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), quantitative analysis has been shown to enhance reproducibility (1-6). To assess accuracy, the results of imaging need to be compared with an accepted gold standard such as coronary angiography (7) or patient outcomes. In this issue of iJACC, Otaki et al. (8) report the results of a comparison between automated MPI and subjective visual analysis for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with possible or established coronary artery disease. The authors analyzed MPI in 19,495 patients enrolled in the REFINE SPECT (REgistry of Fast Myocardial Perfusion Imaging with NExt generation SPECT). This registry consists of 5 multinational medical centers that performed technetium-labeled single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) MPI using ultrafast imaging (solid-state detectors) camera systems. Subjective visual analysis was performed at each site by experienced board-certified nuclear cardiologists who had access to clinical and functional data and also sitespecific quantification software to aid in the generation of the clinical report.

Presumably some centers, such as Cedars-Sinai, used the same software program that was applied in the core laboratory to provide the on-site nuclear cardiologists with quantification results as part of the visual analysis interpretation. There are several possibilities to explain the approximately 50% mismatch between visual and quantitative analysis category assignments, including the fact that the same software program may generate different results if the images were processed differently (e.g., selection of different contours) by on-site versus core laboratory technologists; the different quantitation software programs used on-site versus the core laboratory program could produce different results; the on-site nuclear cardiologists generating the final clinical report might have been more strongly influenced by other factors (subjective interpretation of the images, clinical and hemodynamic data, and others) that weighed more heavily than the available on-site quantification results. It would be interesting to know how many patients were enrolled at each site and what on-site software quantitation programs were used, but even knowing this information would not provide a complete answer to this issue. How should the results of this study be applied in clinical practice? Since the combination of visual and quantitative analysis provided more accurate prognostication than either approach alone, the logical answer is that both techniques should be used.

We explored how the quantitative polarization metrics evaluated in entire cross sections vary among different types of plaques, classified by conventional OFDI according to established qualitative structural criteria (plaque analysis).

The present study comprises a plaque analysis evaluating entire cross sections evenly distributed along all imaged coronary arteries and a cap analysis focusing solely on the fibrous caps of culprit lesions (Figure 1A). For the plaque analysis, all pull backs were uniformly divided into segments of 5 mm in length, progressing distally and proximally from the culprit lesion (Figure 1B). From the resulting total of 508 segments, comprising 2,540-mm pull back length, 166 segments were excluded from the analysis because of the following criteria: 1) containing a stent or from within 5 mm proximal or distal to an implanted stent (n \u00bc 150); 2) subject to predilatation (n \u00bc 2); and 3) poor image quality due to insufficient blood clearing (n \u00bc 14). In each of theretained 342 5-mm segments, only the cross section with the smallest luminal area was identified for further analysis. If this cross section contained a side branch of diameter >1.5 mm, it was replaced with another section from the same segment. For segments containing fibroatheromas, instead of the smallest luminal area, the cross-section with the thinnest fibrous cap thickness was used for analysis. = fibrocalcified plaque FF = fibrofatty plaque FP = fibrous plaque NSD = normalized SD OCT = optical coherence tomography OFDI = optical frequency domain imaging PR = plaque rupture PS = polarization-sensitive SAP = stable angina pectoris TCFA = thin-cap fibroatheroma ThCFA = thick-cap fibroatheroma Massachusetts General Hospital and the Erasmus University Medical Center have patent licensing arrangements with Terumo Corporation.

ACS culprit lesions were identified on the basis of invasive coronary angiography, electrocardiographic ST-segment alterations, and/or regional wall motion abnormality on echocardiographic assessment. SAP target lesions were determined on the basis of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, nuclear scan, stress test, and coronary angiographic findings. For the cap analysis, we identified the cross section with the smallest luminal area in the culprit or target lesion of each patient (Figure 1B). Every other cross-sectional image up to 5 mm both proximally and distally, if featuring a lipid arc exceeding >90 , was included into the analysis, resulting in a total of 244 cross sections. CONVENTIONAL OFDI ANALYSIS. Two independent investigators (A.K. and L.J.C.Z.) analyzed the conventional OFDI appearance of the selected images using QCU-CMS viewing software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). Conventional OFDI analysis was performed blinded to the polarimetric signals. Luminal area was measured in all cross sections. Percentage area stenosis was calculated as previously reported (8), taking the mean of the largest lumen within 5 mm proximal and distal to the lesion containing the current cross section as the reference. Each selected cross-section was then categorized as either of normal artery, fibrous plaque (FP), fibrofatty plaque (FF), fibrocalcified plaque (FC), thick-cap fibroatheroma (ThCFA), thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA), or plaque rupture (PR), on the basis of the conventional OFDI signal(Figures 2A1 to 2G1). Briefly, a vessel with a tunica intima thinner or similar in thickness to the tunica media was labeled as a normal artery (Figure 2A1). FP was defined as a plaque with high backscattering and relatively homogeneous OFDI signal (Figure 2B1). Plaques with calcium, which appears as a signal-poor or heterogeneous region with a sharply delineated border within fibrous tissue, were classified as FC (Figure 2D1)(9). A plaque with a lipid arc of more than 90 was defined as a fibroatheroma. A lipid-rich plaque with a lipid arc extending <90 was categorized as FF, to appreciate the optical properties of the small lipid-rich area (Figure 2C1). In fibroatheromas, the fibrous cap thickness was measured around its thinnest part 3 times by each observer, and then the averaged value was calculated. If the fibrous cap thickness was <65 mm, the plaque was categorized as TCFA and as ThCFA otherwise. PR was defined as a plaque featuring intimal disruption and cavity formation (Figures 2E1 to 2G1). In cases of discordance between the observers, a third investigator (B.E.B.) acted as referee to achieve consensus classification, and the majority was used as the final plaque classification.QUANTITATIVE BIREFRINGENCE AND DEPOLARIZATIONANALYSIS.

DISCUSSION This first-in-human pilot study of intravascular polarimetry demonstrates how it augments conventional OFDI plaque characterization with quantitative polarization properties, measured through standard intravascular OFDI catheters simultaneously with the conventional OFDI signal. The polarization features offer refined insight into tissue composition, consistent with our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in plaque progression and destabilization. The major finding of this study is that fibrous caps in ACS culprit lesions and ruptured plaques exhibit lower birefringence compared with the caps of target lesions in SAP patients within our limited study cohort.

Inflammation is a known mechanism of plaque destabilization(2,22,23). Macrophages release enzymes including matrix metalloproteinases that destroy the extracellular matrix and weaken the cap(22). Our observations suggest that the presence of active macrophages may increase depolarization, whereas the effect of their presence causes a reduction in birefringence.The physical mechanism inducing depolarization in atherosclerosis remains to be elucidated. We speculate that lipid droplets exceeding the size of the wavelength used for OFDI and small cholesterol crystals, which have been postulated to be a crucial factor in the initiation of inflammatory response in atherosclerosis(24), are the origin of the observed depolarization.Consistent with our previous cadaveric human heart study of intravascular polarimetry(16), we observed that calcifications located in fibrous tissue exhibited lower birefringence and depolarization than those in lipid-rich lesions. Although the OFDI appearance of microcalcifications has not been established (6), we speculate that their presence in fibrous caps contributes to a reduction of the cap birefringence, together with a lack of collagen organization and content and absence of smooth muscle cells. The few occurrences of white thrombus in the present study had minimal impact on the underlying polarization signatures. However, the stronger attenuation of red thrombus may lead to an apparent increase in depolarization that would impair interpretation of the underlying vessel wall, similar to conventional OFDI. STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, our study consisted of a small number of patients from a cohort of nonconsecutive patients and was cross-sectional in design. Considering potential selection bias of patients, our findings should be interpreted with caution, although we included all patients imaged with intravascular polarimetry. Furthermore, the limited number may have led to a potential overestimation of the differences between polarization features when performing multiple pairwise comparisons and prevented multivariate analysis. Because of its compatibility with clinical OFDI catheters, intravascular polarimetry can be readily applied to any patient eligible for conventional OFDI, and future well-designed studies are needed to ascertain our current findings.",

Combination of intravascular ultrasound and OCT or OFDI has been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy of identifying fibroatheromas (13). Future histopathologic validation studies are needed to inspect the ability of polarization properties to distinguish between different plaque types and potentially enable automated plaque classification.Third, we observed that the NSD was associated with depolarization in the focal fibrous caps but not in the entire caps. Macrophage infiltration frequently occurs very locally, and averaging the signals across entire caps carries less meaning than across a local region of interest. Moreover, the required normalization of the NSD depends delicately on the ROI, and evidence supporting the NSD metric remains scant.We suspect that both NSD and depolarization capture aspects of macrophage infiltration, but validation studies with histology are needed to identify how depolarization relates to macrophage infiltration.Finally, no patient in the present study had plaque erosion, the second most common cause of ACS. CONCLUSIONS This study presents polarization properties of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in patients with coronary artery disease. The fibrous caps of culprit lesions in patients with ACS and/or PR featured lower birefringence than in those with SAP. When averaged across entire cross sections, the polarimetric signals varied among distinct morphological plaque subtypes. Quantitative assessment of plaque polarization properties by intravascular polarimetry may open new avenues for studying plaque composition and detecting high-risk patients. Prospective studies in larger populations are needed to evaluate how polarization metrics could translate into improved patient outcomes and optimized medical therapy compared with using only the structural features available to conventional OFDI.

These investigators have previously demonstrated that 2 features related to the polarization of light, birefringence and depolarization, are operative in human coronary plaques, and can be detected ex vivo via an intravascular polarization-sensitive (PS)-OCT/optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) catheter-based system (13).Birefringence is a measure of optical anisotropy, or the difference in the refractive index of light polarized (oriented) parallel and perpendicular to the plaque tissue. In plaque, the degree of birefringence reflects the amount of collagen and smooth muscle cell (SMC) content(14). Depolarization refers to how quickly polarized light returns to a depolarized (randomly oriented) state, and potentially reflects the content of lipid particles, macrophage accumulation, or cholesterol crystals. In the context of high-risk plaque features such as a thin-cap fibroatheroma(TCFA), the investigators previously demonstrated ex vivo that PS-OFDI-derived low birefringence indicates low collagen/SMC content, and high depolarization indicates high amounts of lipid/macrophages/ cholesterol crystals (13). In this current report, the investigators extend their prior ex vivo study by demonstrating the feasibility of performing intracoronary PS-OFDI in 12 patients with ACS and in 18 patients with stable angina. The investigators first demonstrated that in culprit lesions, ACS lesions exhibited lower birefringence (lower collagen/SMC content) in the plaque, total fibrous cap, and focal fibrous cap zones, as compared with stable CAD lesions. In addition, in the thinnest part of the fibrous cap (focal cap analysis), culprit ACS lesions exhibited higher depolarization rates (putatively, higher lipid/macrophages/cholesterol crystal content), compared with stable lesions. This SEE PAGE 790 difference was not observed when the entire fibrous cap was analyzed, however. Patients with ACS also displayed a significantly lower minimum fibrous cap thickness (219 mm vs. 291 mm), as expected. Next, to examine differences in polarization of culprit lesions on the basis of their pathological subtype, 342 selected PS-OFDI cross-sectional images were classified as normal artery (n \u00bc 31), fibrous plaque (n \u00bc 84), fibro-fatty (n \u00bc 45), fibrocalcific (n \u00bc 81), thick-cap fibroatheroma (n \u00bc 88), TCFA (n \u00bc 11), or plaque rupture (PR) (n \u00bc 2). The investigators observed for the first time in living patients that depolarization properties differed between various plaque types, with fibrous plaque producing the highest birefringence, and normal artery producing the lowest birefringence. However, there were no unique differences in birefringence for TCFA or PR compared with other subtypes, in part, possibly due to low sample size, but also indicating that birefringence may not be an easily usable classifier to identify high-risk plaque subtypes. It remains to be determined whether birefringence measures could refine the rupture risk of OCTidentified TCFAs, namely, that for a TCFA with a given fibrous cap thickness, lower birefringence might indicate greater instability (lower collagen/SMC content), as suggested by the investigators' generalized estimating equation model. With respect to depolarization, the investigators demonstrated the lowest rates of depolarization in normal and fibrous plaques, and the highest rates in TCFA or PR (albeit with limited sample size). Similar to the preceding comments for birefringence, it remains to be determined for a given TCFA whether a higher rate of depolarization will predict a higher risk of future plaque rupture, as was also suggested by the generalized estimating equation model, demonstrating an association of depolarization with OCTderived plaque macrophages. In summary, the investigators should be congratulated for advancing the field of intracoronary optical imaging-based plaque characterization, and in particular for developing a clinical intravascular imaging system and approach in an academic environment. As a next step, longitudinal outcome studies are needed to determine the potential additive clinical value of PS-OFDI beyond conventional OCT.

Mechanisms of atherothrombosis and vascular response to primary percutaneous coronary intervention in women versus men with acute myocardial infarction: results of R uptured thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFAs), frequently implicated at the site of culprit coronary thrombi, are hallmarked by the presence of a thin, inflamed fibrous cap overlying a large necrotic lipid core (1,2). Motivated by the need to identify rupture-prone plaques prospectively in patients, a number of intravascular modalities, including optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI), virtual histology, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and near-infrared spectroscopy, have been investigated to detect TCFAs (3,4). A critical challenge is that TCFAs with similar morphological features do not all possess an equal likelihood of rupture. In 70% of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), multiple nondisrupted TCFAs are found remote from the culprit site and in nonculprit arteries (5,6). Moreover, 20% of plaque ruptures are observed in necrotic core (NC) lesions with thicker fibrous caps (>100 mm), intraplaque hemorrhage, or calcifications (5-7). These findings call into question the effectiveness of an imaging paradigm that relies entirely on detecting TCFA features and highlight the need to augment morphological findings with critical biomechanical metrics to evaluate the risk of plaque rupture accurately.",

This study details a retrospective analysis of an investigational study that included 33 patients with ACS (n \u00bc 13) and stable angina pectoris (n \u00bc 20) who underwent imaging using IVUS according to standard of care, followed by OFDI imaging between August 2008 and July 2015 at the Thorax Center, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands (Supplemental",

OFDI and IVUS imaging were performed following diagnostic coronary angiography in 33 patients (10 before percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], 8 after PCI, and 15 both before and after PCI). Gray scale IVUS (3.2-F, 30 MHz, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts; = peak stress metric TCFA = thin-cap fibroatheroma of Coalesenz; and has received grant support from the National Institutes of Health for retrospective analysis of optical frequency domain imaging and intravascular ultrasound images in this study. All other authors have reported that they have no relationships relevant to the contents of this paper to disclose. Gregg Stone, MD, served as Guest Editor for this paper. IVUS IMAGE CO-REGISTRATION. OFDI and IVUS image co-registration was performed using previously established criteria for plaque identification (18) with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland). Image cross sections with stent struts, side branches spanning beyond the field of view, or visible thrombi were excluded from the analysis because these features obstructed the accurate determination of luminal geometry. IVUS datasets were co-registered with OFDI pullbacks with the aid of landmarks, such as side branches, presence of calcifications, lumen shape, plaque shape, and the relative distance from such landmarks and structures. From OFDI images, we identified all NCFAs defined as plaques with a high-intensity fibrous cap overlying an NC with low-intensity, diffused signal, with a lipid arc >90 . A total of 61 nonruptured NCFA plaques were identified in 39 coronary arteries of 30 patients. Co-registered OFDI-IVUS image pairs at the location of the thinnest fibrous cap in all 61 NCFAs were selected for analysis using FEM (detailed later). In addition, to investigate the influence of plaque morphological parameters, OFDI-IVUS image pairs were further selected for analysis at 1-mm increments over the entire length for each NCFA. Thus, a total of 195 co-registered OFDI-IVUS image pairs from 61 nonruptured NCFAs were analyzed. In 3 additional patients, ruptured NCFAs were observed at the sites of culprit coronary thrombosis; these patients' datasets were used to test the use of the MSE for localizing plaque ruptures as detailed later. DEFINITION AND MEASUREMENT OF PLAQUE PARAMETERS. In all 33 patients, NCFA morphological parameters were quantified following manual segmentation of the lumen, fibrous cap and calcium contours from OFDI images, and the NC and external elastic lamina (EEL) contours from composite OFDI-IVUS images (Figures 1A to 1E) by using QCU-CMS software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). All parameters were calculated as an average of measurements performed in triplicate. thick \u00bc minimum radial thickness), NC arc angle (NC arc \u00bc maximum circumferential arc), calcium thickness (Cal thick ), and calcium-lumen distance (Cal depth ) were measured (Figure 1C). From the composite OFDI-IVUS images, plaque thickness (Plq thick \u00bc distance between lumen and EEL), NC thickness (NC thick \u00bc NC thickness at the location of thinnest cap region), lumen (CSA lumen ), necrotic core (NC area ), and calcium areas (Cal area ) were measured (Figure 1E).Tot area was defined as the area of the coronary cross section encompassed by the EEL, Plq area was measured by excluding CSA lumen from the Tot area (Plq area \u00bc Tot area \u00c0 CSA lumen ), and percent area stenosis (%AS) was derived from OFDI by: (1 \u00c0 CSA lumen / [RefLu area ]) 100%. FINITE ELEMENT MODELING. To derive the MSE, we first investigated the relationships between individual plaque parameters and peak stress values in 61 nonruptured NCFA cross sections selected at the location of the thinnest fibrous cap. FEM was used to calculate reference peak stress values because it is the most widely used and validated approach for biomechanical analysis (8-14) (see Supplemental Appendix for details). Material and model properties. Plaque geometry was reconstructed from the segmented contours by using a simple MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) script (Figures 2A to 2E) and exported to ABA-QUS software (version 6.14, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes [3DS], Boston, Massachusetts) to perform FEM. An anisotropic, linear-elastic, quasi-incompressible material model was used to conduct FEM, similar to other published reports (8,12). The material properties of the plaque constituents were obtained from published reports (8,15,19) (Supplemental",

Then, a stepwise multivariate regression model (SPSS version 24.0.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, New York) was used to determine the interdependencies among plaque variables and to identify the most influential parameters. In some cases, multiple NCFAs were identified in the same patient; therefore, the generalized estimating equation was used to account for intrapatient dependencies. In all cases, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The principal plaque parameters that significantly influenced the peak stress were used to derive the MSE. The accuracy of the MSE was evaluated by comparing the MSE-calculated peak stress metric (PSM) with the FEM-measured peak stress values using the leave-1-out cross-validation method. RESULTS PEAK STRESS IN NCFA LESIONS. The FEM-derived peak stress in 61 NCFAs ranged from 108.8 to 1048.0 kPa and was located at the shoulder of the NC (n \u00bc 32), summit of the NC (n \u00bc 11), boundary between calcium and lipid or at the edge of calcific nodule (n \u00bc 10), and along the longest diameter (major axis)",

A large range of peak stress values (black arrowheads) is observed in the 5 necrotic core fibroatheromas (NCFAs) influenced by plaque geometry. MSE VERSUS FEM-DERIVED PEAK STRESS. To evaluate the accuracy of the MSE in estimating peak stress directly from plaque parameters, the MSE-calculated PSM was compared against FEM-derived peak stress using the leave-1-out cross-validation method. Excellent correlation (R \u00bc 0.85; p <0.0001) was observed (Figure 5A) between PSM and FEM-derived peak stress in 61 NCFA cross sections, thus confirming the accuracy of the MSE.Figure 5Bshows the results of the Bland-Altman analysis with a negligible bias of 0.27 kPa in the MSE estimation of peak stress.These results demonstrate that the absolute values of PSM calculated by MSE are similar to those computed by FEM. INFLUENCE OF PLAQUE PARAMETERS ON MSE-DERIVED PEAK STRESS. In 61 nonruptured NCFAs, 195 image pairs selected at 1-mm increments along the length of the NCFA were analyzed using the MSE (Equation 1) to identify cross sections with the highest PSM value. We observed that cross sections with the highest PSM along the NCFA length coincided with the locations of the thinnest fibrous caps in 56% (n \u00bc 34) of plaques, whereas in 44% (n \u00bc 27) of plaques, the highest PSM occurred at cross sections distinct from that of the thinnest fibrous cap. Furthermore, the FC thick was the sole determining factor for the highest PSM in only 7% of analyzed sections, and a combination of parameters including the FC thick influenced the highest PSM in 49% of cases (SupplementalFigure 2",

Similar to our results, other studies also showed that peak stress is increased with increasing luminal area, lumen eccentricity, NC thickness, NC area/NC arc, and arterial remodeling index (12,14). Interestingly, in our study only 56% of the plaques elicited the highest PSM at the frame with the thinnest cap location, and FC thick was a sole determining factor in only 7% of plaques. In fact, prior histopathological and clinical OFDI studies have suggested that ruptured NCFAs are often observed in locations with thicker fibrous caps, calcific nodules, and increased plaque burden (5-7). Our results similarly showed that the location of the thinnest fibrous cap did not influence the highest PSM in 44% of NCFAs and that other parameters, including largest NC thick , NC arc , Plq area , NCCal area , and smallest CSA lumen, were the determining factors in these cases. The results likely provide a quantitative biomechanical corroboration for the foregoing clinical observations and provide a unique opportunity for further investigations. Consistent with previous studies implicating the influence of calcium (20), our study demonstrated that peak stress was influenced by the presence, location, and area of calcification in the coronary cross section. When evaluated as an independent variable, Cal area indicated moderate correlation with peak stress (R \u00bc 0.35; p < 0.01). However, the overlap of calcification with the NC, specifically the sum of NC area and Cal area , significantly influenced the peak stress (R \u00bc 0.62; p < 0.0001). These results suggest that in addition to the presence of calcification, the proximity of calcium deposits with NC is likely an important mediator of plaque rupture. We noticed",

These higher peak stress values may be attributed to a larger percentage of patients with ACS (40%) included in our study who had larger NC plaques with increased overall plaque burden. Thus, it is likely that plaques with complex geometries, irregular luminal boundaries, and heterogeneous subintimal structures resulted in greater stress concentrations. Furthermore, a majority of plaques in our study contained calcific nodules, which could amplify the measured peak stress up to 5-fold (20). The MSE approach described here will likely open critical opportunities for clinical investigations to determine the range of peak stress values in ACS versus stable angina patients. In a separate pilot study conducted in 10 cadaveric hearts, we confirmed that composite OFDI-IVUS imaging improved the accuracy of quantifying plaque morphological parameters compared with the sole use of IVUS or OFDI (Supplemental Figure 1). This is because OFDI is superior to IVUS in detecting subsurface thin caps, microcalcifications, and minute irregularities with exquisite spatial resolution of w10 mm. However, the OFDI signal is rapidly attenuated in the NC obscuring the determination of the NC outer boundary. Conversely, IVUS provides a large imaging depth, albeit at reduced spatial resolution for measuring plaque outer boundaries. Consequently, we further showed that composite OFDI-IVUS determination of plaque geometry significantly improved the accuracy of estimating PSM compared with the sole OFDI or IVUS (Supplemental Figure 2, Supplemental",

Future prospective, longitudinal clinical studies will be necessary to determine conclusively the associations among peak stress, coronary plaque ruptures, and subsequent thrombosis. In this study, the most time-consuming post-processing step involved OFDI-IVUS image co-registration through identification of image landmarks (see the Methods section, earlier), which added additional processing time and complexity. Recently, bimodality imaging systems have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and likely will be available soon for patient use to enable tandem OFDI-IVUS imaging through a single integrated catheter, which will further reduce procedure time, patients' risks, and post-processing complexities(24,25). Following image co-registration in our study, plaque segmentation and parameter calculation wereperformed in just 2 min, with an additional 5 s for the MSE calculation of PSM for composite image pair. The use of 2-dimensional FEM in this study did not take into account the longitudinal shape of tortuosity of the coronary wall and out-of-plane deformations that could influence stress distributions. This was because coronary catheterization in patients was performed in conjunction with single-plane angiography, thereby precluding the evaluation of 3dimensional coronary vessel shape. In the future, the use of biplane angiography or CT angiography (CTA) may allow us to include these additional parameters into a further refined MSE model that includes longitudinal coronary geometry and tortuosity metrics. However, drawbacks of biplane angiography and CTA include the substantial increase in procedure time, contrast volume, radiation dose, and cost (26); therefore, these approaches may not be suitable for routine PCI procedures. Future studies in and may help in identifying patient subgroups that may benefit from the inclusion of biplane angiography or CTA. CONCLUSIONS We present a novel and straightforward approach to estimate peak stress in coronary plaques. With a simple analytical equation that defines the cumulative influence of 2-dimensional plaque geometry, we demonstrated that the PSM could be accurately estimated, which may potentially serve as a pivotal biomechanical indicator of plaque rupture risk in patients. Consequently, this new approach obviates the need for tedious and mathematically intensive FEM. In the future, we anticipate that the MSE could be used in conjunction with routine OFDI and IVUS evaluation, which will enable further investigation into the relationship between biomechanical stress profiling and subsequent plaque-related events.

ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE: Dr. Seemantini K. Nadkarni, Wellman Center for Photomedicine, of Morphology and Plaque Structural Stress* Peter H. Stone, MD, a Dimitrios I. Fotiadis, PHD b,c T he past few decades have witnessed extensive investigations to risk-stratify individual coronary artery plaques in an effort to identify plaques likely to progress, destabilize, and cause a new major adverse cardiac event, so that potentially life-saving intervention strategies could be preemptively deployed. Initial investigations focused primarily on anatomic characterization of plaque morphology, but long-term outcomes studies underscored that although anatomic characterization of plaques was an essential foundation to understand current and future plaque behavior, the predictive value of plaque anatomic features alone is low (1-4). Multiple animal and human natural history studies demonstrated that the natural history of individual plaques is remarkably heterogeneous over time (5,6), and the majority of ostensibly high-risk plaques by anatomic features remain quiescent and do not destabilize, perhaps related to arterial compensatory remodeling (5,7). It has become clear that additional features of atherosclerosis vascular biology beyond anatomy are critically contributing to the ongoing natural history of individual plaques. A major thrust of more recent basic and translational research has, therefore, focused on the biomechanical forces affecting the plaque, because these pathobiological processes may provide the crucial incremental stimulus that determines whether an individual plaque will progress, destabilize, or become quiescent (8-10). Plaque rupture occurs when the biomechanical forces affecting the plaque exceed the strength of the material properties of the plaque and its constituents (plaque structural stress [PSS]) (10), and recent studies have indicated that assessment of PSS, based on virtual histology-intravascular ultrasounds (IVUS) features, is associated with increased likelihood of plaque rupture (11). Yet these studies typically require extensive post-processing that are both time-and resource-intensive, and have not been feasible for routine clinical use. Computational modeling has been widely used in arterial flow simulations using idealized geometries or geometrical models obtained in a personalized manner though image segmentation and 3-dimensional reconstruction methods from various imaging modalities, such as coronary angiography, IVUS, optical coherence tomography, and coronary computed tomography angiography, which are widely used in clinical practice(12,13). Some of these imaging modalities can depict in detail the composition of the plaque, as well as its geometry, which can be further used in the modeling of the blood flow(14).IVUS in particular can provide details on plaque composition, which, combined with the morphology, can guide the understanding of its vulnerable behavior. Several computational studies focused initially on the computation of endothelial shear stress (ESS), which can be used as a metric to detect areas of low ESS, where atherosclerotic plaque is prone to develop and progress, or the low or high ESS,",

It proposes a technique that is SEE PAGE 804 methodologically far quicker than previous assessments, which were based on computational modelling for the estimation of the peak stress in necrotic core fibroatheromas. The findings of the study are compared with the finite element method computation, which is the most common methodology to estimate the distribution of wall stresses and particularly the peak stress. In the current approach, only morphological characteristics are used, not fluid dynamics computations, which are time consuming. The plaque parameters used in this study and are associated with peak stress are: fibrous cap thickness, necrotic core angle, necrotic core thickness, lumen area, and necrotic core including calcium areas and plaque area. Those parameters are obtained from bimodal imaging combining optical frequency domain imaging and IVUS, which is not common in routine clinical settings at this time; the segmentation of the images was performed manually. From these plaque features, the authors created an equation for the estimation of the peak stress metric using regression coefficients. They determined an excellent correlation between this metric and the finite element-derived peak stress. They also assessed the ability of this metric to locate the site of plaque rupture using data from 3 patients. Such an approach would be very favorable for clinical management and interventional cardiologists, because it requires only segmentation and extraction of 6 features, which can be performed manually, requires no expertise on finite elements, and requires only the use of a closed form equation. It is also much faster because it avoids finite element calculations that, depending on the complexity of the arterial morphology, may require extensive computational time. The evaluation presented in the investigators' work is limited and may not cover the full range of stress peak values where this metric is valid. In that respect, this methodological approach needs further validation with various artery/plaque morphologies and range of peak stress values, as well as localization of rupture prone sites. This multifactorial metric described by Doradla et al. (15) does not include other biomechanical stresses, which are based on coronary artery 3dimensional reconstruction, and have been found to affect plaque behavior and are associated with major adverse cardiac event. These stresses include the axial plaque stress, derived from the plaque longitudinal intraluminal geometry (16) or the local ESS that serves as a pro-inflammatory stimulus to increase degrading proteases within the high-risk plaque that weaken the internal structures and render it physically more susceptible to rupture (8,9). Broader multifactorial biomechanical stress metrics in the future may even be associated with greater prognostic value as more biologically meaningful forces are incorporated, especially if they can be rapidly assessed. The approach pioneered by Doradla et al. may be useful in the future to guide the extraction of similar indices for other biomechanical stresses. ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE: Dr. Peter H.

The prevalence of atrial functional MR is reported to be between 3% and 15% in AF patients and those with atrial functional MR are associated with worse clinical outcomes. Because there are few published data regarding therapeutic strategies of atrial functional MR, understanding the principles of therapeutic options and their target mechanisms is important with regards to clinical practice until sufficient evidence is established. In this review, the known mechanisms, clinical implications and, when possible, potential therapeutic options of atrial functional MR are discussed. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2020;13:820-35) \u00a9 2020 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AF is the most common rhythm disorder observed in 2% of the general population and the prevalence is further increasing as the society is aging (1,2). It is well known that atrial fibrillation (AF) causes left atrial (LA) and mitral annular dilatation without left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (3-5). However, whether AF and succeeding annular dilatation cause significant mitral regurgitation (MR) without LV dysfunction remains controversial. It had been widely recognized that MR can occur without significant degenerative changes of the mitral leaflets in patients with severe left heart dilatation or LV dysfunction caused either by ischemic heart disease or idiopathic myocardial disease. These types of MR were called functional (secondary) MR in contrast to degenerative (primary) MR caused by the organic change of mitral valve itself (6). Research performed during the early era of 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) reported annular dilatation as the primary mechanism related to functional MR caused by LV dilatation/dysfunction (",

            "text": "Moreover, the mitral leaflets further enlarge when physiologically necessary. Recent studies using animal experiments and 3DE have shown that the mitral leaflet is not of a fixed size and that it enlarges or thickens in response to various stresses (\"leaflet remodeling\"). Dal-Bianco et al. (29) artificially stretched the papillary muscle down toward the apex to produce functional MR in 50% of 12 sheep that were studied. It was observed 60 days later that the mitral leaflet area expanded by 17 AE 10% only in the animals that underwent this procedure. Histopathological tests revealed that endothelial-mesenchymal transition played a central role mechanistically in this change (Figure 1) (29). A succeeding in vivo study using 3DE performed by the same group demonstrated that patients with functional MR had a smaller mitral leaflet to closure leaflet area ratio (which represents insufficient leaflet remodeling) than was found in healthy individuals and in those without significant MR (28). The same findings have also been reported in patients without LV dysfunction. Using transesophageal 3DE, we studied the mitral leaflet size in AF patients without LV dysfunction. Although AF patients without MR showed a larger mitral annulus than found in healthy individuals, the mitral leaflet area was also greater and the mitral leaflet to the annulus area ratio was similar to that in healthy individuals (Figure 2). In contrast, patients with atrial functional MR showed significantly smaller mitral leaflets compared with the annulus (insufficient leaflet remodeling). These results strongly suggest that leaflet remodeling contributes to the severity of atrial functional MR (22). Kim et al. (23) also reported similar findings of leaflet remodeling in patients with AF using transthoracic 3DE. They further investigated the temporal change in the degree of leaflet remodeling in 7 patients with AF. During a median 4.8-year follow-up period, both the annulus area and leaflet area were enlarged in all the patients; however, significant MR occurred in 4 patients whose leaflet area of these studies, as annulus area enlarged, the ratio of mitral leaflet area to the annulus area decreased. Furthermore, all patients with an annulus area >8 cm 2 /m 2 (which is about double the normal size) had significant MR, suggesting that leaflet remodeling as a compensatory mechanism has limitations. In contrast, there was a heterogeneity of MR in patients with an annulus area between 5 the severity of MR was correlated with the degree of leaflet remodeling. In other words, with this intermediate range of annular dilatation, the significance of atrial functional MR depends on the degree of the leaflet remodeling (Figure 3). Measuring mitral leaflet area in vivo requires clear images in diastole, because in systole it is difficult to measure the coaptation area, which is not necessarily symmetric. Since there have been only 2 studies reporting total leaflet area measured in diastole thus far, the prevalence of insufficient leaflet remodeling is unknown; however, the prevalence does not seem to be",

            "text": "The anterior portion of the mitral annulus is attached to the aortic root, a stable fixed position in the heart, whereas the posterior portion is attached to the junction of the LA and free wall of the LV, which is stretched outward when the LA and mitral annulus are observed to enlarge. This posterior attachment is located inside of the crest of the LV inlet. Because of this anatomical structure, expansion of the LA wall leads to deviation of the posterior annulus toward the outside of the myocardium, causing tethering of the posterior leaflet (Figure 4) (32,34). Silbiger (32) proposed this phenomenon of \"atriogenic leaflet tethering\" as a potential mechanism causing worsening MR in patients with mitral annular dilatation (Figure 5). This phenomenon of the development of a steeper posterior leaflet angle has previously been described by a textbook as \"hamstringing\" in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis (35) and has recently been verified by a few reports using 2DE and 3DE (21,24). Such patients with a steep-angled posterior leaflet are often encountered in clinical practice. They present with asymmetric posterior tethering, with posterior leaflets \"bending\" toward the LV, and have posteriorly deviated eccentric MR jets (Figure 6B). The evidence of atriogenic leaflet tethering show discrepancies between studies, however. First, these studies measured different kinds of angles: angle A, which measures between the annular plane and the line connecting the annulus and coaptation point of the anterior and posterior leaflet and angle B, which measures between the annular plane and the line connecting the annulus and the posterior leaflet tip. Because there is redundant leaflet beyond the coaptation point towards the LV, angle B is greater than angle A. In the study by Machino et al. (24), there was a significant difference in angle A between patients with and without MR. In contrast, in the Ito et al. (21) and Takahashi et al. (33) studies, they reported a difference in angle B, and not in angle A, between patients with and without MR. In addition, the values of the reported angles vary widely among studies (",

It is well established how AF causes, simultaneously to the electrical alteration, a relevant microscopic and macroscopic LA remodeling (42). The interstitial fibrosis, which gradually replaces the contractile atrial myocardium, is responsible for an increase of the LA stiffness together with an altered chamber compliance. Speckle tracking echocardiography is a second level echocardiographic technique that guarantees an angle-independent and objective quantification of myocardial deformation (43). Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of LA strain analysis, especially peak LA strain, to detect fibrosis in LA wall and to stratify the risk of stroke in patients with AF (Figure 7) (44). In fact, a strong inverse correlation between the amount of fibrosis assessed by 3D gadolinium late enhancement magnetic resonance and that by peak LA strain has been shown in patients with AF (45); the patients with lower values of peak LA strain have a higher risk of cardioembolic events than those with normal peak LA strain.

LA strain was also correlated with LA compliance(47), and the amount of fibrosis in LA wall detected by Masson's trichrome staining on tissue samples in patients with MR (48); thus, LA function is impaired by both AF and MR, resulting in further risk of worse clinical outcome. AF also causes a substantial beat-to-beat variation in cycle lengths and filling time. Although tachycardia generally reduces regurgitant volume per beat (49,50), we sometimes experience improvements in the severity of MR immediately after cardioversion of AF to sinus rhythm. Similar findings were reported in an animal experiment (51). Several old studies suggested that the loss of atrial systole was associated with insufficient mitral valve closure in diastole and early systole (52,53), resulting in atrial functional MR. To date, however, there are few data regarding the direct effect of rapid ventricular response and heart rate variability on atrial functional MR and further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MECHANISMS. Importantly, each of the mechanisms discussed so far relate to 1 aspect of \"atrial remodeling\" seen in patients with advanced AF. In other words, these various structural and functional changes caused by AF usually progress simultaneously. As shown in the Central Illustration, structural changes start with LA and annular dilatation, which are accompanied by flattening of saddle shape of the annulus. Annular dilatation, at least in part, seems to play a role in leaflet remodeling, which attenuates the annulus area to leaflet area imbalance. Functionally, AF reduces annulus contractility, which results in a larger systolic annulus area and worsens the annulus area to leaflet area imbalance. LA dysfunction is further accelerated by MR and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. These changes progress simultaneously in most cases, making it difficult to assess the net influence of each factor. Some studies used a statistical approach to adjust for confounders (Table 2); however, unfortunately, there has been no study that considers all the possible mechanisms together with an appropriate statistical approach and a sufficient sample size. It should therefore be acknowledged that this relationship remains theoretical speculation and it is not fully understood whether each factor is just a bystander or an important trigger influencing prognosis.

Although treatment with TAVR will become increasingly common, moderate or severe mitral valve (MV) disease, most notably mitral regurgitation, remains the most prevalent type of valve disease, surpassing aortic stenosis prevalence by greater margins with each decade of life (1,2). Computed tomography angiography (CTA), both cardiac and vascular, has become the standard imaging modality to assess suitability for percutaneous transcatheter MV repair/replacement (TMVR) and transcatheter tricuspid valve (TV) repair/replacement (TTVR) (3-5). This manuscript provides the background and technical details for imagers of all backgrounds to be able to direct and perform highquality cardiac and vascular computed tomography (CT) imaging for MV and TV assessment for percutaneous intervention planning. We begin by reviewing the new transcatheter approaches to severe MV and TV disease, followed by a detailed review of how to perform a high-quality CTA examination, taking into consideration scanner-and patient-specific variables and trouble-shooting common challenges and providing specific tips for MV and TV CT protocols. BASIC PRINCIPLES: MITRAL AND TRICUSPID DISEASE AND CURRENT PERCUTANEOUS VALVE TECHNOLOGIES MV DISEASE. MV disease is the most common valve disease in the United States. Almost 1 in 10 patients 75 years and older in the United States will have moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (1). Only a small proportion of patients with moderate or severe regurgitation undergo surgical repair/replacement (6). The percutaneous Mitra-Clip (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, Illinois) is the only commercially approved technology for severe native valve regurgitation in the United States, and is currently approved for use in symptomatic secondary mitral regurgitation in high-risk or inoperable patients only (7). In Europe, the Cardioband (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) and Mitralign (Mitralign, Inc., Tewksbury, Massachusetts) devices hold a CE mark. Therefore, there is significant potential to expand percutaneous TMVR into a much larger population (estimated as up to 5 million patients in the United States by 2030). Additionally, patients with degenerative mitral stenosis (constituting up to 60% of patients older than 80 years with mitral ste-Figure 1). There are approximately 15 MV device trials ongoing in the United States and Europe. The recent findings of the COAPT trial, which demonstrated that the Mitra-Clip can reduce hospitalization and all-cause mortality and improve exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with heart failure with moderate to severe or severe functional mitral regurgitation compared with medical management alone has only increased excitement (14).

The main challenges for TMVR are selection of the optimal approach to placement (most commonly direct transapical, with developing transvenous and transseptal therapies), avoidance of damaging subvalvular structures and the conduction system, close proximity to the aortic valve/annulus, and avoidance of creating significant left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction (Central Illustration, .

If device is unknown, one may need adequate left-sided and right coronary opacification to assess potential tricuspid device interaction with the right coronary artery. SCANNER FACTORS IMPACTING IMAGING Several scanner-related factors affect image acquisition. CRANIOCAUDAL (Z-AXIS) COVERAGE. Frequently for TMVR and TTVR patients, the craniocaudal height of the heart is 14 to 16 cm given the extensive dilation of the atria and ventricles that can occur. Having a more advanced scanner (higher temporal resolution/ greater number of detector rows) has advantages for greater craniocaudal coverage and faster acquisition, although a minimum requirement of a 64-detectorrow scanner is needed. Shorter craniocaudal coverage, however, results in a longer scanning time and longer breath-hold (problematic for a patient with heart failure symptoms), and increases the likelihood of motion or misregistration artifact. SCANNER ACQUISITION MODE. A primary goal for pre-TMVR and pre-TTVR CT evaluation is to obtain a high-quality electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated cardiac scan with as close to full cardiac cycle coverage (R-R interval) as possible (23).

Several morphological aspects, such as bileaflet MVP with diffuse leaflet redundancy and thickening (due to accumulation of proteoglycans through the spongiosa), chordae elongation, and annular dilation, electrocardiographic abnormalities, severity of mitral valve regurgitation, and LV dysfunction have been associated with arrhythmias in MVP (12). An anatomic substrate for promoting electric instability was described by Sanfilippo et al. (13) and subsequently by Han et al. (14). These investigators demonstrated the presence of LGE on valve leaflets (indicating the expansion of spongiosa due to proteoglycans accumulations) and on the tips of papillary muscles (indicating fibrosis). Interestingly, the presence of fibrosis at the papillary muscles tip was more often observed in a subgroup of patients with arrhythmic MVP. More recently, Basso et al. (15) confirmed and extended these observations. In 43 young patients (age range 10 to 40 years) with MVP and myxomatous valve who died of sudden cardiac death, the investigators found patches of replacement-type fibrosis on papillary muscles and on subendocardial-midmural layers of basal posterior wall, just below the posterior valve leaflet (Videos 2 and 3). They hypothesized that systolic mechanical stretch of myocardium closed to the mitral valve might have accounted for injuries, eventually leading to replacement-type fibrosis. Marra et al. (16) provided further evidence for this hypothesis, finding that mitral annular disjunction, defined as a separation between the left atrial (LA) wall-mitral hinge line and the LV free wall, is a constant feature in patients with arrhythmic MVP (Figure 4). They hypothesized that this peculiar morphological aspect might contribute to the systolic stretch of the myocardium close to the valve and, as a result, to the propensity to develop regional LV fibrosis and electric instability. According to their conclusions, the genesis of malignant arrhythmias in MVP may be recognized in the deadly combination of a substrate (papillary muscle tips and basal free wall myocardial fibrosis) and a trigger (i.e., myocardial stretch exacerbated by mitral annular dysfunction) (Figure 5).

This latter approach was extensively covered in a recent reviewby Mahida et al. (23). Electrophysiological substrate mapping during sinus or paced rhythm allows the characterization of scar areas to identify so-called conducting channels, the electrophysiological basis for re-entry circuits of VT. These channels can be identified by intracardiac voltage mapping or electrogram analysis and are considered the ablation target. Radiofrequency applications at the conducting channels entrance (the so-called scar dechanneling technique) can homogenize the scar without extensive ablation and could possibly increase the ablation efficiency (Figures 3 and 7). High-resolution contrastenhanced CMR accurately delineates the scar and makes it possible to differentiate between scar core and border zone and, together with advanced postprocessing, to allow the visualization of the border areas inside the scar as corridors of viable tissue connecting the healthy myocardium (24). These corridors correlate with the conducting channels on electroanatomic mapping. CMR-based visualization of scar characteristics is helpful in VT ablation procedures (Figures 3 and 7) (25). As recently reported by Andreu et al. (26), the ablation strategy of scar dechanneling alone results in lower recurrence and mortality rates in more than one-half of patients, despite the required limited ablation extent compared with a more traditional ablation approach. The investigators compared the outcomes of 54 patients (34%) who had pixel signal intensity maps were obtained from a high-resolution 3-T LGE CMR study and imported into the navigation system to aid in VT substrate ablation, with those of the remaining 105 patients, who had pixel signal intensity maps could either be obtained or be imported into the navigation system. The use of pixel signal intensity maps to guide the ablation minimized the number of radiofrequency applications and ablation delivery time needed. This was also associated with a higher rate of immediate success after substrate ablation, thus suggesting better identification of the arrhythmogenic substrate and target ablation site. Notably, the information obtained from CMR, showing the wall distribution of the scar, contributed to the decision on the optimal approach (endocardial, epicardial, or combined), which could explain the reported better outcomes in the CMR-aided group compared with the",

(36). These investigators demonstrated that computed tomographic wall motion dyssynchrony metrics and regional mechanical contraction analysis with LV lead location concordant to regions of maximal wall thickness were associated with 2-year major adverse cardiac events but not 6-month CRT response. Of course, 1 of the major drawbacks of computed tomography-based evaluation is the significant radiation exposure. Indeed, the effective radiation dose for the retrospective computed tomographic scan was 11.7 AE 5.0 mSv and the total radiation dose for delayed imaging was 13.5 AE 5.0 mSv. Using the patient's coronary venous anatomy, scar distribution electrophysiology, and mechanical contraction pattern to identify and target the optimal site for the LV lead is a novel approach to improving CRT effectiveness, thus representing personalized CRT for the 21st century. Larger scale, multicenter, randomized clinical trials will be required to demonstrate whether this approach yields greater CRT response compared with the conventional implantation method. Notably, despite the best-in-class imaging and lead technology for guiding quadripolar LV lead implantation in a single procedure (31-35), in about one-third of patients, a CMR-defined target segment, based on avoiding scar and targeting mechanical dyssynchrony, could not be achieved. This was because of the lack of coronary venous anatomy, resulting in placing the quadripolar LV lead adjacent to or in the scar. This observation strongly suggests that expecting responses >70% with a conventional transvenous CRT system in patients presenting mostly with ischemic etiology represents a utopic goal. As a consequence, an alternative treatment strategy is urgently needed; whether this solution would be an LV percutaneous epicardial approach or LV endocardial pacing remains to be determined.

Pellikka, MD THE EVALUATION OF VALVULAR HEART DISEASE (VHD) IS CHALLENGING WHEN THERE IS DISAGREEMENT between objective hemodynamic metrics of severity and subjective findings of symptomatology. Stress echocardiography is recommended for the evaluation of these discordant cases because exertion can unmask hemodynamic perturbations of severe valvular disease and provide documentation of exertional limitations. However, the findings of exercise intolerance can be confounded by factors unrelated to VHD such as deconditioning, obesity, peripheral vascular disease, or lung disease. Sonographic B-lines detected by lung ultrasound correlate with the presence of extravascular lung water (pulmonary edema) (1). Recent stress echocardiography studies have correlated the development of exercise induced B-lines with markers of increased left ventricular filling pressure and decreased peak oxygen uptake (2). Herein we present the use of lung ultrasound to identify exercise induced pulmonary edema as an objective marker of VHD severity in 2 patients with mixed mitral valve disease. Resting echocardiogram hemodynamics are shown in Figure 1. Patient A had clear lung zones at rest (Figure 2, Video 1). During exercise the mean diastolic mitral gradient increased to 25 mm Hg (Figure 3) and post-exercise lung ultrasound demonstrated sonographic findings of extravascular lung water (Figure 4, Video 2). Patient B had a peak mitral diastolic gradient of 27 mm Hg with exercise (Figure 5) and post-exercise lung imaging showed the development of dynamic B-Lines consistent with extravascular lung water (Figure 6).

The stroke volume adapts rapidly to both internal homeostatic requirements and external stresses. If ventricular filling were suddenly limited (as in the case of a ventricular extrasystole), the resulting acute distension of the heart's chambers would serve to enhance the shortening of the next systole (through the Frank-Starling mechanism), thus serving to prevent ventricular overfilling. Similarly, if the sympathetic nervous system is activated (as during exercise), stroke volume increases, not only because of the recruitment of blood volume from peripheral reservoirs, but also because adrenergic stimulation augments the shortening of cardiomyocytes. These short-term adaptations ensure that stroke volume can change rapidly to provide adequate oxygen delivery to the periphery, while avoiding increases in pulmonary venous pressures.",

            "text": "tissue). When properly performed, the calculation of myocardial volume is the same whether performed during systole or diastole; because myocardial tissue is not compressible, myocardial volume does not change during contraction(3). Importantly, the MCF is a measure of the degree to which the myocardium contracts during systole (assessed by stroke volume) when considered in relation to its capacity to contract (assessed by myocardial volume)(1,2). As a result, the MCF represents a generalized measure of myocardial shortening. Conceptually, the MCF is very similar to myocardial strain; however, strain measures shortening in a localized segment of the heart, whereas the MCF synthesizes information about shortening in all domains (longitudinal, radial, and circumferential) and expresses the sum in a single measurement(2).Being a composite measure, the MCF does not consider the timing of myocardial shortening, whereas strain can be quantified throughout the cardiac cycle (i.e., the timing of strain [the strain rate] can be calculated).The most commonly used metric of left ventricular systolic performance in clinical practice, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), also relies on stroke volume. However, when the LVEF is calculated, the stroke volume is normalized for (i.e., divided by) the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) rather than the myocardial volume. The normalization of stroke volume for the LVEDV is based on the inherent assumption that the LVEDV is an important driver of stroke volume. That assumption may be valid at extremely short time intervals when small increases in LVEDV act to enhance the force of the next systole (as in the Frank-Starling mechanism). However, the LVEDV is not a primary mechanism of enhancing stroke volume during longterm adaptations seen in human health and disease. More importantly, the ratio of stroke volume to LVEDV is not a direct measure of myocardial shortening, and changes in the ratio do not reflect changes in the degree of myocardial shortening; in fact, measurements relating to the myocardium are not included in determination of the LVEF (4).

Shown in ovals are the range of values for myocardial contraction fraction in (1) physiological hypertrophy; (2) metabolic-inflammatory HFpEF; (3) HCM; (4) cardiac amyloidosis; and (5) dilated cardiomyopathy as a prototype for HFrEF.

HCM \u00bc hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; HFpEF \u00bc heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF \u00bc heart failure with therefore not surprising that there is an imperfect relationship between the measurement of LVEF and measures of myocardial shortening (i.e., global myocardial strain and MCF), especially in states where changes in loading conditions or increases in wall thickness or decreases in left ventricular dimensions act to mask the presence of a significant impairment of systolic function when it is evaluated by LVEF (4-8). Less fiber shortening is required to produce a similar LVEF in a thick-walled compared with a thin-walled ventricle. Similarly, a smaller ventricle will have higher EF than a larger ventricle, despite identical shortening and wall thickness (4). Consequently, the measurement of LVEF cannot accurately reflect systolic myocardial performance in small and thickened hearts. Even when the LV cavity is not diminished, deficiencies in longitudinal shortening may not be translated into decreases in systolic ejection if circumferential shortening is not meaningfully compromised (9). MYOCARDIAL SHORTENING AS A METRIC OF MYOCARDIAL CONTRACTION IN PATIENTS WITH HEART DISEASE Changes in the LVEF can parallel changes in myocardial shortening in certain cardiac disease states (Central Illustration, Table 1). Patients who lose cardiomyocytes permanently or who have severe impairment of cardiomyocyte function, as in the case of dilated cardiomyopathies, typically have an increase in LVEDV that parallels the deterioration in systolic function. As the myocardial disease ensues and progresses, myocardial shortening is impaired, the LVEDV increases, and the LVEF declines. Pfeffer et al (10). have suggested that the progressive remodeling of the left ventricle (often estimated by the LVEDV) is responsible for a progressive decline in systolic performance over time, but it seems more likely that LVEDV increases in parallel with the impairment of myocardial shortening because neurohormonal activation leads to both a loss of healthy cardiomyocytes and to LV dilatation in a parallel fashion (11). Because stroke volume is preserved in most patients with heart failure and a reduced EF, the decrease in the LVEF (the ratio of stroke volume to LVEDV) simply reflects the increase in the LVEDV. Therefore, the calculation of LVEF can reflect the impairment of myocardial contraction seen in most patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (12) because the decline in systolic function is closely paralleled by a proportionate increase in LV volumes. However, in many cardiovascular disorders other than HFrEF (i.e., most patients with hypertrophy or who have heart failure with normal or near-normal values for LVEF), myocardial shortening is strikingly impaired without parallel changes in LVEDV because the loss of cardiomyocyte function does not lead to enlargement of the LV cavity. For example, in the typical patient with pathological hypertrophy (i.e., hypertrophic or hypertensive cardiomyopathy), although LV mass increases, the pattern of cardiomyocyte contraction is disorganized, and thus, the myocardium shortens less than might be predicted from the myocardial volume (13). Similarly, in the typical patient with cardiac amyloidosis, there is marked infiltration and thickening of the walls of the left ventricle by amyloid deposits that compromise cardiomyocyte survival, thus impairing contractile function (8). In both hypertrophic and amyloid cardiomyopathy, the derangement of cardiomyocyte function can be discerned by measures of myocardial",

Clinically, early prediction of cardiotoxicity in patients receiving chemotherapy may be useful for defining an optimal strategy to prevent ventricular functional impairment. Previous research has demonstrated these studies showed inconsistent predictive accuracy of strain. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of STE-based myocardial strain in the prediction of cardiotoxicity in chemotherapy-treated patients. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register up to October 2017 for related studies. Studies were included if: 1) patients treated with chemotherapy were prospectively enrolled; 2) echocardiography was performed to assess left ventricular ejection fraction to quantify cardiotoxicity, and the definition of cardiotoxicity was described; 3) STE-based strain analysis was performed; and 4) statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of strain. We computed the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio. A summary receiver-operating characteristic curve was constructed, and the area under the curve (AUC) served as a global measure of test performance: less predictive (0.5 $ AUC #0.7), moderately predictive (0.7 $ AUC #0.9), or highly predictive (0.9 $ AUC #1).

Analyses were conducted using Stata version 13.StataCorp, College Station, Texas) and Meta-DiSc version 1.4 (Ram\u00f3n y Cajal Hospital, Madrid, Spain). Ten prospective studies with 627 patients (age range: 30 to 69 years; 36% to 100% women) were included. The definitions of cardiotoxicity were similar, with the incidence of cardiotoxicity ranging from 7% to 35%. All 10 studies used 2-dimensional STE, and global longitudinal strain (GLS) was the only shared reported variable analyzed for the accuracy of predicting cardiotoxicity by all 10 studies. The timing of GLS assessment (<32.5 days to 6 months) and cardiotoxicity assessment (4 to 15 months) differed, so the interval between these 2 time points differed accordingly (2 to 12 months). GLS cutoffs were not pre-specified but varied among studies.

Findings should be interpreted with caution, and further research is required to understand the potential pathophysiology, dose-response effects of cannabis use, and long-term implications of regular use on the cardiovascular system. Health care professionals and policy makers may need to advise caution on regular recreational cannabis use until such systematic research is available.

Diagnostic accuracy in detecting significant coronary artery disease (CAD) differs between men and women, underlining the need for further investigation of sex-specific differences (1). In this subanalysis of the prospective CAD-Man (Coronary Artery Disease Management) trial, we evaluated if women, compared with men, benefit from undergoing computed tomography angiography (CT) instead of invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in terms of procedural complications. Events in the follow-up period were defined in the study protocol (2). The CAD-Man trial showed that CT is a safe and accurate gatekeeper to ICA. Initial CT instead of ICA reduced minor complications and the length of hospitalization, while increasing the diagnostic yield of ICA. Patients with suspected CAD based on atypical chest pain and a clinical indication for ICA were randomly assigned to CT or ICA (2). Major procedural complications (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and other complications prolonging hospitalization by at least 24 h) and minor procedural complications (e.g., groin hematoma, groin pain, infection, allergy, thrombosis, and arteriovenous fistula), defined as occurring within 48 h of the last related procedure, were compared between men and women. The sex analysis was a planned secondary analysis (2). The chi-square test was used to evaluate minor and major procedural complications. Additionally, a post hoc power calculation was performed. The calculations were performed by nQuery release 7 (Statistical Solutions Ltd., Boston, Massachusetts).",

            "text": "We read with great interest the papers byBartko  et al. (1) and Gorcsan et al. (2) on the predictive value of dyssynchrony markers for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response, irrespective of the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB). In the first study, Bartko et al. (1) provided arguments for a causative association between papillary muscle resynchronization and reduction of functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) following CRT, irrespective of the presence of LBBB. Accordingly, it could be interpreted from their study that the cause of (papillary muscle) dyssynchrony, either pure electrical or pure mechanical, is of no or lesser relevance with regard to CRT response and reduction of FMR. Although we acknowledge the pathophysiological contribution of papillary dyssynchrony to FMR (3), we have some concerns about the definition of FMR nonresponders as a comparator or control group. The latter group had only mild FMR at baseline compared with the FMR responders, whereas the FMR responders had pronounced FMR severity at baseline. Therefore, the mild FMR in the nonresponder group might preclude any meaningful early or late reduction of FMR, and the conclusions with respect to the independent causative role of papillary dyssynchrony in FMR might be less robust than they seem. Likewise, FMR responders had much more interventricular and papillary muscle dyssynchrony at baseline (greater prevalence of typical LBBB?), which made a comparative analysis on the effects of resynchronization in non-FMR responders difficult. Also, from a pathophysiological point of view, it would have been of interest to see whether FMR was significantly reduced immediately or shortly after CRT implantation. It might be relevant to explore the differential contribution of restored papillary muscle synchrony to early FMR reduction versus the reduction of FMR due to reverse remodeling that emerged at later stages of CRT. It is known that early decreases in FMR following CRT are related to acute improvements of left ventricular contractility and blunted papillary muscle dyssynchrony (3). We believe that addressing these issues would have strengthened the conclusions of their study. In another paper in this issue of iJACC, Gorcsan et al. (2) expanded their previously published findings on the use of strain-based systolic stretch index (SSI) and its association with CRT response at a multicenter level. In addition, the investigators mentioned that SSI yielded excellent predictive values in both patients with LBBB and patients with non-LBBB. Because of the results of subgroup analyses in large randomized trials that showed poor response rates in non-LBBB, this was again a remarkable, but interesting, finding (4,5). Also, in line with the report from Bartko et al. (1), the study of Gorcsan et al. (2) suggested that the cause or pathogenesis of dyssynchrony, being either electrical or pure mechanical, might be of less importance with regard to CRT response. Although our group is convinced of the strong pathophysiological basis of SSI in typical LBBB (6), it remains to be explored whether a similar or different pathophysiology governs SSI in non-LBBB.",

We share a common belief with all of the investigators that echocardiography plays an important role in the evaluation of electromechanical dyssynchrony, but many issues remain to be solved before it can re-enter the clinical arena. Leslee J. Shaw, PHD, Executive Editor, Y. Chandrashekhar, MD, Editor-in-Chief I n years past, the evidence base for conventional nuclear cardiology imaging amassed at a rapid pace and provided robust evidence supporting widespread use of the modality. However, nearly a decade ago, the pace of this research in singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging largely halted, which led to much concern that this slower pace of advancement would affect the current high use and reimbursement patterns across the United States. What may have been valid concerns in the past can no longer be stated, as recent clinical research in SPECT and PET imaging has focused both on the area of stable ischemic heart disease and also on broadening the indications for use, including amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and imaging for cardiac valve infection. Moreover, more recent evidence also includes a focus on validating prior research using novel technology, such as risk stratification with myocardial perfusion PET (1) or with highefficiency SPECT(2). In this issue of iJACC, one such effort is presented from the REFINE SPECT (Registry of Fast Myocardial Perfusion Imaging with Next generation SPECT) registry (3). The novelty of this report lies not only in the use of more contemporary SPECT imaging, but also in a direct comparison of prognosis associated with visual versus automated quantitative interpretation of rest/ stress myocardial perfusion. The data from the REFINE SPECT registry includes a very large series of patients who had undergone myocardial perfusion imaging across multiple centers, thus providing robust and generalizable findings broadly applicable to the field of nuclear cardiology. For many years, experts in the field have long advocated for nuclear imagers to use quantitative interpretation as a guide or aid to their visual interpretation, akin to that of a second reader. Quantitative imaging has found favor in multiple imaging modalities-originally in nuclear",

From the National Institutes of Health-sponsored PROMISE (PROspective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial, the 2-year event rate was significantly higher for patients with a normal stress imaging study compared with a normal coronary computed tomographic angiogram (6). Moreover, approximately onehalf of major coronary disease events occurred in patients with physician-interpreted normal stress tests (7). The findings put forth from the REFINE SPECT registry combined with the PROMISE reports support that improvements in risk detection may yield better detection of at-risk patients. There are a number of limitations of this registry, including the use of revascularization as part of the composite endpoint. Given the predominance of relatively low-risk, stable patients, continued use of late revascularization as an endpoint seems unjustified, as many patients could have protracted evaluations including initial deferment of invasive procedures. In lower-risk patients, the current evaluation pathway may take months and may remain within the window of the index evaluation. Given the large cohort and frequently documented other composite endpoints, the use of revascularization as an event seems superfluous and distracting from the main findings of this report. Moreover, we continue to have a paucity of evidence on stress imagingguided antianginal and preventive therapies, which are increasingly vital to care when invasive approaches are not supported by randomized trials, such as with the ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial (8).",

Eur Heart J 2017;38: EDITORIAL COMMENT Calcific Aortic Stenosis An Evolution of Thoughts* Harisios Boudoulas, MD, a,b Konstantinos Dean Boudoulas, MD a C alcific aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases today; its prevalence increases with age and usually manifests after the seventh decade of life (1,2). Traditionally, it was thought that the calcification of a tricuspid aortic valve resulting in AS was related to degeneration of the valve caused by mechanical stress (wear and tear effect) occurring over the years secondary to aging. Newer developments, however, suggest that calcific AS is the result of an active inflammatory process in which genetic, anatomic, and environmental risk factors contribute to the development of the disease. Several of the risk factors involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, such as arterial hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking, and others, actively contribute to the development and progression of calcific AS (1,3). It is speculated that the initial event in the development of calcific AS is damage to the endothelium caused by stress allowing lipids to enter. This in turn, initiates an inflammatory process where T cells, myocytes, mast cells, and CD3-positive leukocytes accumulate (1). Inflammation results in the stimulation of neoangiogenesis with new vessel formation; rupture of the fragile new vessels may occur, which also contributes to the acceleration and progression of the disease. The atherosclerotic process over time may differentiate into various pathways including \"bone\" formation and calcification (1,4). Despite the close association between atherosclerosis and calcific AS, many patients with risk factors and coronary atherosclerosis do not have AS, and many patients with AS do not have coronary atherosclerosis. In a study from our laboratory, it was found that 62.2% of patients with a tricuspid aortic valve and calcific AS who had aortic valve replacement, and 26.3% of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and calcific AS who had aortic valve replacement required concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery (5). It seems, therefore, that other",

            "text": "study by Ramchand et al. (2) expands previous observations to patients with AS; in this study, increase plasma ACE2 activity in patients with AS was associated with myocardial hypertrophy, higher mortality, greater calcification of the aortic valve, reduced myocardial (right atrial) ACE2 activity, and myocardial (right atrial) fibrosis. Furthermore, the study byRamchand et al. (2) provides insight into the pathophysiologic mechanisms related to the development of calcific AS and may stimulate further research on this topic; however, at present there is not enough information to apply these findings into clinical practice. THE AORTIC STENOSIS COMPLEX Risk factors related to atherosclerosis play a role in the development of calcific AS. In addition, there are many other factors involved in the development of calcific AS including genetic and anatomic abnormalities of the aortic valve (more in bicuspid and less obvious in tricuspid aortic valve) (1,10). A stiff aorta (secondary to aging, atherosclerosis, and risk factors related to atherosclerosis) resulting in turbulent flow in the root of the aorta may also contribute to the development of AS (1,3,6). The renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, and especially tissue ACE2 activity, may facilitate the development and progression of calcific AS (2). Loss of bone density may also involve aortic valve calcification (7). It seems, therefore, that multiple factors contribute to the development of calcific AS. Furthermore, long-standing AS can lead to left ventricular remodeling; myocardial fibrosis; left ventricular dysfunction; and if untreated, heart failure and death. Hemodynamic stress and myocardial cell injury and death all contribute to this process (1,3). Thus, AS affects the entire cardiovascular system and has also been affected by other disorders and diseases as well. It can be concluded, therefore, that AS is not an isolated valve abnormality, but rather a complex entity with global systemic implications.

Exercise CMR T1 Mapping for Myocardial Ischemia Testing No Gad, No Drugs, No Problem?* Martin Ugander, MD, PHD a,b T he clinical workup of angina using noninvasive cardiac imaging techniques is a foundational layer on the spectrum of coronary care, and this is an area that has a long history of \"battle of the tests\" in cardiology. The quadrimodal tug of war among stress echocardiography, nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has effectively been around for as long as the respective modalities have existed, and all 4 modalities currently hold a justified place in either guidelines or appropriate use criteria. Although each modality has its strengths and weaknesses, there is an ongoing innovation race for each modality to reduce or eliminate contraindications for the test, and improve simplicity, cost, clinical usefulness, and diagnostic and prognostic performance in an effort to build a better mouse trap for the workup of myocardial ischemia. The leading CMR approach to evaluating myocardial ischemia is CMR stress myocardial perfusion using first-pass imaging of an extracellular gadoliniumbased contrast agent (GBCA) during pharmacological vasodilator stress. Such an approach has been shown to have technical feasibility (n \u00bc 17) (1), then an impressive diagnostic potential (n \u00bc 48) (2), excellent large-scale diagnostic performance (n \u00bc 752) (3), and recently, excellent multicenter prognostic performance (n \u00bc 9,151; mean follow-up >5 years) (4). Recent developments have refined the ease and simplicity of use for the technique, with the introduction of highquality quantitative perfusion maps color-coded in milliliters per min per gram and generated automatically on the scanner at the time of imaging (5). This method shows diagnostic accuracy both in singlevessel disease and expanded usefulness of the ability to identify coronary microvascular disease",

            "text": "AGREEMENT BETWEEN CMR AND FFR. Several studies have investigated the diagnostic value of CMR in stable CAD. Notably, the multicenter CE-MARC (Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography for Diagnosis of Coronary Heart Disease) trial documented a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 84% of CMR for diagnosing obstructive CAD (26). In contrast to the high agreement reported in stable patients with suspected CAD, we observed a lower concordance between CMR and FFR in the evaluation of nonculprit lesions after STEMI. This may be partially explained by selection, although the applied selection is not uncommon because patients with STEMI with multivessel disease are currently more often referred for FFR-guided revascularization of the nonculprit lesions. In our study, only vessels with $50% diameter stenosis were included for analysis because nonculprit vessels without significant angiographic stenosis can be deferred based on the angiogram obtained during primary intervention. Including only vessels with angiographic stenosis will inevitably result in a lower agreement with FFR because the concordance between 2 continuous variables decreases when the investigated values are close to the cutoff. Selection can therefore influence the agreement between any 2 techniques. For instance, [ 15 O] H 2 O positron emission tomography, which is considered to be the gold standard for myocardial perfusion imaging, is reported to be concordant with FFR in 86% of cases(27). When only vessels with angiographic stenosis are included, the agreement drops to 72% (28), similar to our results. Second, hyperemic perfusion and FFR show physiological discordance in approximately 25% of cases(27), mainly because of varying degrees of microvascular dysfunction(29).After STEMI, microvascular dysfunction can be present either concomitantly or as a result of acute ischemic injury. Several studies have indicated that in STEMI acute microvascular dysfunction is not confined to the culprit area but also affects remote myocardium(30,31). Given a certain geometric stenosis, microvascular dysfunction limits maximal achievable blood flow resulting in lower hyperemic perfusion and elevated FFR. As the physiological disturbances resulting from the acute ischemic injury resolve over time, FFR decreases, whereas hyperemic MBF and MFR increase(31,32). The agreement between CMR and FFR observed in the present study therefore does not reflect failure of either technique but rather underscores that FFR represents a different measure of physiology than hyperemic MBF and MFR. It is important to note, however, that ischemia is driven by reductions in flow, not changes in coronary pressure(33). One could therefore argue that in combined epicardial and microvascular disease, hyperemic perfusion more accurately discerns diseased vessels inducing ischemia than FFR.OPTIMAL TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR NONCULPRIT LESIONS IN STEMI. Patients with STEMI with multivessel disease represent a complex patient group. A wide spectrum of treatment options is available for nonculprit lesions, ranging from complete multivessel revascularization during primary intervention to a conservative strategy of optimal medical therapy alone. Four large randomized trials have thus far compared preventive revascularization to a conservative approach (12,34-36). All demonstrated lower incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events in the preventive revascularization group, indicating that optimal medical therapy alone does not suffice. Importantly, the results of these trials should not be interpreted as preventive revascularization being the optimal treatment strategy for nonculprit lesions after STEMI because no data exist demonstrating that noninvasive imaging is inferior. Previous studies have demonstrated that negative results of both CMR and FFR are associated with a low risk of events (2,37); however, the prognostic implications of discordancy between CMR and FFR are unknown. Although the present study demonstrates moderategood agreement between CMR and FFR in the evaluation of nonculprit lesions after STEMI, it remains uncertain whether CMR-guided treatment of nonculprit lesions also translates into different outcome than FFR-guided revascularization. Interestingly, patients with STEMI with multivessel disease have a low angina burden during follow-up. In the present study, patients reported a mean SAQ score of 90 for angina frequency, which corresponds to chest discomfort experienced once a month or not at all.This is in line with findings from previous studies, which also reported that nonculprit lesions after STEMI rarely cause angina(12,(34)(35)(36). Silent ischemia after myocardial infarction is nevertheless important to diagnose and treat. In the SWISSI II (Swiss Interventional Study on Silent Ischemia Type II) trial, patients with a previous myocardial infarction, documented ischemia, and angiographic stenosis",

            "text": "Randomized trials comparing imaging guided treatment of nonculprit lesions to preventive revascularization, such as the ongoing iMODERN (iFR Guided Multi-vessel Revascularization During Percutaneous IS PERFUSION QUANTIFICATION WORTH THE EFFORT? In recent years, increased focus has been placed on absolute quantification of myocardial perfusion using CMR. Quantification holds several advantages over visual assessment. It is less dependent on the experience of the reader and does not require a myocardial region with normal perfusion for comparison. Mordini et al. (5) compared the diagnostic performances of fully quantitative, semiquantitative, and visual assessment and reported superiority of fully quantitative analysis over both visual and semiquantitative analysis. In contrast to the findings of Mordini et al. (5), 2 small studies found no benefits of quantification over visual assessment (6,7). In keeping with the results of these studies, a recently published substudy of the CE-MARC trial also reported similar diagnostic performance of quantitative and visual assessment (8). This could be in part because visual analysis already displayed excellent accuracy. In the present study, visual analysis had moderate agreement with FFR. Quantification nevertheless failed to demonstrate incremental value. STUDY LIMITATIONS. The present report is a substudy of the REDUCE-MVI trial, which was powered to assess differences in IMR in the culprit vessel of patients with STEMI randomized to a maintenance therapy of ticagrelor or prasugrel. The current substudy may therefore be underpowered and the limited sample size may have resulted in a type II error in the comparative testing of AUC curves. In addition, the limited sample size hindered analysis on the diagnostic performance of CMR in patients with abnormal microvascular function, as defined by either CFR thermo or IMR; however, the agreement between CMR and FFR in patients with STEMI with multivessel disease has never been reported which make the present data unique. Second, invasive measurements of FFR were used as reference. Although FFR is considered the gold standard for guiding revascularization in patients with stable CAD, it has not been established as such for the management of nonculprit lesions after STEMI. The results of the present study should therefore be interpreted with caution. Finally, collateral connections from and to stenotic nonculprit vessels may have influenced FFR measurements. In the present study, visual collateral vessels were identified in 5 patients. Collateral pathways of smaller size that are not visualized on coronary angiography may nonetheless have influenced the results. CMR and FFR have moderate-good agreement in the evaluation of nonculprit lesions in reperfused patients with STEMI with multivessel disease. Fully quantitative analysis of myocardial perfusion is not superior to semiquantitative or visual analysis.

E-mail: robin@nijveldt.net. PERSPECTIVES COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: This single-center study demonstrated that in patients with STEMI with multivessel disease, CMR and FFR have moderate-good agreement in the assessment of nonculprit lesions. Fully quantitative, semiquantitative, and visual analysis showed equivalent diagnostic performances. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 1: Neither CMR measurements of myocardial perfusion nor invasive measurements of FFR have been established as the optimal treatment strategy for nonculprit lesions after STEMI. Multicenter trials randomizing patients with STEMI with multivessel disease to a perfusion imaging guided strategy or an invasive physiology guided strategy are thus eagerly awaited. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 2: Multicenter studies using invasive physiology as reference should answer the question if quantification of myocardial perfusion improves the diagnostic performance of CMR. Even if so, quantification of absolute MBF from perfusion CMR is currently a laborious, timeconsuming process, in contrast to the more straightforward visual analysis. To implement perfusion quantification into the clinic, image acquisition and post-processing have to be accelerated and automated.",

Notably, noninvasive positron emission to-Progressive reduction in acute CMR infarct size is well recognized in the absence of microvascular obstruction. Hyperenhancement on late gadoliniumenhanced imaging from a large acute infarct could encroach on the watershed area of a nonculprit stenosis, increasing the likelihood of a type I error in stress perfusion assessment. Infarct size is thought to be stable between 1 to 12 months, with residual increase in extracellular volume or peri-infarct myocardial edema in a watershed area confounding stress CMR assessment being unlikely (9,10). The 1-month time point selected here for stress CMR and FFR is therefore practical and noncontentious for a STEMI study.What does stress-CMR really demonstrate post-STEMI? Speculatively, it could show a composite of epicardial and microvascular ischemia as well as any remnant watershed edema or microvascular obstruction; a corollary could thus be drawn to coronary flow reserve. Reclassification of lesion significance by stress-CMR was not discussed by the authors, and the implications of discordance between CMR and FFR post-STEMI remain unknown. Interestingly, diagnostic agreement of any 2 tests near their diagnostic cut-points may diverge, owing to selection for patients with moderate disease, regardless of the test's superior accuracy in mild and severe disease. This was recently illustrated in a comparison of computed tomography (CT)-derived FFR (FFR CT ) and invasive FFR (11). Prevalence of disease and the distribution of values in any patient cohort could also potentially bias a test's diagnostic accuracy. Given the biological variability inherent to the clinical context, the moderate agreement between stress-CMR and FFR reported in the current study is not unexpected. Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have aimed to establish the optimal management of nonculprit lesions in patients undergoing PCI for STEMI, with controversy centered on timing of nonculprit PCI and identification of ischemia. Intermediate-sized ischemia-focused trials previously suggested FFR-guided nonculprit revascularization post-STEMI reduces unplanned revascularization and subsequent cardiovascular events (12). However, complete revascularization was recently demonstrated to be superior to culprit lesion-only PCI in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or MI (13). Notably, more than 60% of lesions were angiographically severe and would have been revascularized without further assessment given an ischemia-driven approach. Would patients with more moderate disease have fared equally well with complete revascularization? With additional RCTs powered to clarify the real value of FFR guidance using hard clinical endpoints, comparison with noninvasive assessment might realistically reduce unnecessary angiography. Nevertheless, the elephant in the room remains: plaque instability in STEMI is largely independent of stenosis severity and may drive adverse events. Although FFR CT identification of high-risk vulnerable plaque has recently attracted interest, its diagnostic performance for staged detection of ischemia in STEMI involving multivessel disease has been modest (14). For bystander disease, the idealized future may therefore bring us a myocardial jeopardy score incorporating plaque instability, ischemic myocardial mass at risk, and CMR-defined energetics burden, widening our focus beyond single coronary stenoses. Stress-CMR and complementary gatekeepers to further invasive assessment may eventually help distinguish diffuse atherosclerosis from microvascular disease, targeting mechanical intervention alongside titration of medical therapy to better optimize both symptom burden and outcome.4.

Recently, a novel scanner has been introduced in the clinical field (12). The new technology allows patient scanning with good image quality, even in cases of high heart rate (HR) and HR variability, and it has the capability of combining high-resolution images with myocardial perfusion assessment (13). The goal of the current study was to assess the diagnostic performance of coronary CTA alone, CTP alone, and coronary CTA \u00fe CTP by using the new scanner with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) as the clinical standard.The design of the ADVANTAGE (Additional Diagnostic Value of CT Perfusion Over Coronary CT Angiography in Stented Patients With Suspected In-Stent Restenosis or Coronary Artery Disease Progression) study has been previously described (14). Briefly, 163 consecutive patients were prospectively assessed for enrollment. All patients had previous coronary stenting and underwent ICA between January 2017 and March 2018. Exclusion criteria have also been previously described. After adopting these criteria, 13 The study protocol received ethics committee approval and was registered with the number R509/16-CCM 536. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, who were asked to refrain from smoking and caffeine for 24 h and to maintain fasting for 6 h before the scan. Before coronary CTA, we evaluated rest 12-lead electrocardiogram and previous echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, or nuclear imaging findings in all patients to rule out previous myocardial infarction. Patients with sinus rhythm and HR >65 beats/min before the rest scan received metoprolol intravenously with a titration dose up to 15 mg to achieve a target HR <65 beats/min. Moreover, all patients received sublingual nitrates to ensure coronary vasodilatation. INTERPRETATION. All coronary CTA and CTP were performed with a 256-detector row scanner capable of whole-heart coverage in 1 beat (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and combining 0.23-mm spatial resolution, 0.28 s gantry rotation time, a new-generation iterative reconstruction, and an intracycle motion-correction algorithm for addressing coronary motion artifacts. A Z-axis coverage of 16 cm was used for coronary CTA and CTP in all patients. Rest coronary CTA was conducted according to the recommendations of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (15). All patients received a 50-ml bolus of Iodixanol 320 (Visipaque 320 mg/ml, GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway)",

Using 8-mm thick average multiplanar reformatted images, the myocardium was evaluated on short-axis (apical, medium, and basal slices) and long-axis (2-, 3-, and 4-chamber projections) views. A narrow window width and level (350 W and 150 L, respectively) were used for perfusion defect evaluation. Each myocardial segment was correlated to the specific coronary territory as described by Cerci et al.(16). True perfusion defects were qualitatively defined as subendocardial hypoenhancement encompassing >25% of the transmural myocardial thickness within a specific coronary territory. We considered myocardial ischemia to be present if the myocardial static CTP showed worsening compared with the rest of the CTP in more than one myocardial segment(5).Images were analyzed by 2 readers with >5 years of clinical experience in CTP performance and analysis; the readers were blinded to the clinical, coronary CTA, QCA, and invasive FFR findings. For any disagreement in data analysis between the 2 readers, a consensus agreement was achieved.ICA AND INVASIVE FFR PERFORMANCE AND INTERPRETATION. In all patients, diagnostic ICA was performed within 60 days after coronary CTA examination by certified interventional cardiologists. These cardiologists followed usual clinical indications and standards set forth by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the Society for Cardiac Angiography and Interventions (17). QCA was performed by using QantCor QCA (Pie Medical Imaging BV, Maastricht, the Netherlands). Invasive FFR measurements were performed with the St. Jude Medical PressureWire X (Quantien, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota) with intravenous administration of adenosine at a dose of 140 mg/kg per hour. Measurement of invasive FFR was performed during ICA when clinically indicated, at the discretion of the interventional cardiologist according to standard practice (18). An FFR #0.80 was considered functionally significant. RADIATION EXPOSURE. The effective radiation dose of coronary CTA was calculated by multiplying the dose-length product by 2 conversion coefficients for the chest (K \u00bc 0.014 mSv/mGy cm and K \u00bc 0.026 mSv/mGy cm). The effective radiation dose of ICA was calculated by multiplying the dose-area product by a conversion factor (K \u00bc 0.21 mSv/mGy cm 2 ) for lateral and posteroanterior radiation exposure in the chest area. CORONARY CTA AND CTP ANALYSES. For each cardiac CT analysis, the following parameters were evaluated: 1. Diagnostic rate. Diagnostic rate (number of stentsvessels-patients interpretable/number of stentsvessels-patients evaluated) of coronary CTA, CTP, and of the combined coronary CTA \u00fe CTP evaluation in stent-based, territory-based, and patientbased analyses. Particularly, the diagnostic rate of combined coronary CTA-CTP in a territory-based analysis was defined as the number of coronary territories in which all coronary segments included in that territory was interpretable in terms of anatomy and/or of perfusion/number of territories evaluated. The diagnostic rate of coronary CTA-CTP in a patient-based analysis was defined as the number of patients interpretable/number of patients evaluated. Each patient was considered interpretable if all coronary segments were judged assessable in terms of anatomy and/or interpretable in terms of perfusion assessment. 2. Diagnostic accuracy (true positive D true negative/number of cases). a. Diagnostic accuracy versus QCA by using stents, territories, and patients interpretable only for the analysis.

Regarding the diagnostic accuracy of combined coronary CTA-CTP versus QCA, coronary CTA-CTP was considered positive in the presence of a >50% ISR and/or a perfusion defect in the territory, including that specific stent segment in a stent-based analysis, a >50% stenosis in a native segment, and/or a >50% ISR in a specific coronary territory and/or a perfusion defect in the same coronary territory in a territory-based analysis and a >50% stenosis in a native segment and/or a >50% ISR in any coronary vessel and/or a perfusion defect in any type of coronary territory in a patient-based analysis. This analysis may include cases of discordant coronary CTA and CTP findings classified as positive. In terms of the diagnostic accuracy of concordant coronary CTA-CTP versus QCA, concordant coronary CTA-CTP was considered positive in the presence of a >50% ISR and a perfusion defect in the territory including that stent segment in a stent-based analysis, a >50% stenosis in native segment, and/or a >50% ISR in a specific coronary territory and a perfusion defect in the same coronary territory in a territory-based analysis and a >50% stenosis in native segment and/or a >50% ISR in any coronary vessel and a perfusion defect in any type of coronary territory in a patient-based analysis. c. Diagnostic accuracy versus invasive FFR. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of coronary CTA, CTP, and combined and concordant coronary CTA \u00fe CTP evaluation versus invasive FFR as standard of reference in a vessel-based analysis.A detailed description of any evaluated parameter has been previously reported(14).STUDY ENDPOINTS. The primary endpoints included assessment of the diagnostic performance (diagnostic rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy) of coronary CTA, CTP, and combined and concordant coronary CTA \u00fe CTP evaluations versus QCA as the standard of reference in the territory-based and patient-based analyses. An additional primary endpoint was assessment of the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of coronary CTA, CTP, and combined and concordant coronary CTA \u00fe CTP evaluations versus invasive FFR as the standard of reference in a vessel-based analysis.The secondary endpoint included assessment of the diagnostic performance (diagnostic rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy) of coronary CTA, CTP, and combined and concordant coronary CTA \u00fe CTP evaluations versus QCA as the standard of reference in a stent-based analysis. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Assuming a 40% prevalence of significant ISR or \"de novo\" stenoses in native coronary segments and a diagnostic accuracy of 80% for CTP versus QCA in a territory-based model, a sample size of 150 patients was estimated to identify a difference of 8% between stress myocardial CTP and coronary CTA for detecting significant ISR or CAD progression at QCA with a significance level of 5% and a power of at least 80%. For all patients, per-stent, per-territory, and per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of coronary CTA, CTP, and combined and concordant coronary CTA \u00fe CTP were calculated with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the chi-square test for dependent proportions. In the territory-level analysis, data from different segments were pooled, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy estimates adjusted for correlation within patients were modeled by using the generalized estimating equation approach. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY ANALYSIS. The diagnostic accuracy of CTP was significantly higher than that of coronary CTA in all analyses, including the patientbased analysis (86.7% vs. 76.7%; p \u00bc 0.02). By dividing the study population into 2 groups (patients with $3.0-mm stents only and patients previously treated with small stents [<3.0 mm] only or in whom $3.0-mm and <3.0-mm stents coexisted) and using a patient-based analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of CTP was significantly higher than that of coronary CTA in the group of patients with <3.0-mm stents (88.6% vs. 70%; p < 0.006).

DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF CORONARY CTA, CTP, AND COMBINED AND CONCORDANT CORONARY CTA D CTP VERSUS INVASIVE FFR. An invasive FFR analysis was performed in 36 coronary stenoses of 36 patients. In all cases, FFR was performed for assessing intermediate lesions (50% to 80% diameter stenosis) in native coronary arteries (proximal left anterior descending artery, 15 cases; middle left anterior descending artery, 6 cases; proximal left circumflex artery, 5 cases; proximal right coronary artery, 5 cases; and middle right coronary artery, 5 cases). The diagnostic accuracy parameters of coronary CTA (positive in cases of >50% ISR or de novo stenoses), CTP, and combined coronary CTA \u00fe CTP versus invasive FFR in the vessel-based analysis are reported in SupplementalTable 3 and the Central Illustration. By using evaluable vessels only for analysis, the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of CTP were significantly higher than those of coronary CTA (69% vs. 20% [p < 0.0001] and 75% vs. 35.5% [p \u00bc 0.001], respectively). The diagnostic accuracy of concordant coronary CTA \u00fe CTP was significantly higher than that of coronary CTA (75% vs. 35.5%; p \u00bc 0.01).

Indeed, Rief et al.(11)  found in 20 stented patients that a combined coronary CTA \u00fe CTP assessment improved the diagnostic rate and accuracy of cardiac CT imaging compared with coronary CTA alone (100% vs. 78% at patient level). Similarly, Magalhaes et al. (19) reported a diagnostic accuracy in the territory-based analysis of 91% for combined coronary CTA \u00fe CTP versus 77% for coronary CTA alone in 46 patients. Of note, the current study assessed even more complex patients, as confirmed by the mean value of stent per patient (3.2 in our study vs. 2.5 in the study of Rief et al. [11]). Our study found a significant improvement in the diagnostic rate and accuracy of CTP and combined and concordant coronary CTA \u00fe CTP versus coronary CTA alone in a significantly larger population (150 patients vs. 20 and 46 subjects in the studies of Rief et al. [11] and Magalhaes et al. [19], respectively). Moreover, this study is the first assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of CTP in stented patients not only versus ICA but also versus FFR, which is considered the functional gold standard. In this setting, as expected, CTP was superior to coronary CTA in terms of a significantly higher specificity and diagnostic accuracy when all vessels were used for analysis (69% vs. 16.6% [p < 0.0001] and 75% vs. 30.5% [p \u00bc 0.0002]).

One explanation for these results could be the use of a recently introduced scanner that combines 0.28 s gantry rotation time and a 16-cm Z-axis coverage, allowing scanning of the whole heart in a single cardiac beat also in patients with unfavorable HR(12,21,22).As an additional relevant finding, we emphasize that, in contrast with previous studies reporting low to average sensitivities for CTP versus QCA(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)20), theADVANTAGE study reported good sensitivity values for CTP assessment in both territory-based (88.9%) and patient-based (91.4%) analyses. These findings are also in agreement with a recent study from our group, performed with the same type of scanner in 100 intermediate-to-high-risk patients (obstructive CAD detected in 69% of patients), showing high values of CTP sensitivities (91% and 98% in a vessel-based and a patient-based model, respectively) (13).

            "text": "PATIENT SIZE. Patient size and body habitus affect image quality. As body mass index increases so does image noise, which may need to be overcome by an increase in tube output and, possibly, an increase contrast injection rate(23,35). We recommend a tube potential of 100 kV(p) for most patients, with 120 kV(p) reserved for larger patients, although encourage <100 kV(p) as appropriate. Automated tube voltage selection based on the topograms is helpful with this decision-making. We encourage optimizing one's scanner's tube current, up to the maximal current supported by the x-ray tube, before increasing tube potential. This approach maximizes the inherent properties of iodinated contrast, and limits radiation exposure (23).HEART SIZE. As opposed to normal patient heart size, for which craniocaudal coverage of 10 to 14 cm is typical, the typical pre-TMVR or TTVR patient has significant cardiomegaly, frequently increasing this coverage to 14 to 18 cm. Cardiomegaly needs to be considered when tailoring patient-specific protocols.CARDIAC OUTPUT. In patients undergoing pre-TMVR or pre-TTVR evaluation, the forward flow output is reduced leading to a delay in time to peak opacification(35). This opacification delay should be reflected in setting the appropriate delay time for the bolus tracking approach.RENAL FUNCTION. Renal dysfunction is a common comorbidity in the pre-TMVR and pre-TTVR population. Pushing the lower limit of contrast for a diagnostic scan may be attainable with advanced CT scanners (i.e., extended coverage scanners and dualsource systems). These technologies have been demonstrated to provide comprehensive assessment (of cardiac and vascular for pre-TAVR patients) with as little as 20 ml of iodinated contrast media (36). For patients with severe renal insufficiency (chronic kidney disease stage 4 or greater) or heightened clinical concern, protocol adjustments can be considered. For valve-in-valve TMVR patients and patients with severe mitral annular calcification, noncontrast ECGgated cardiac CT with partial or full R-R interval coverage, reconstructed at thin slices can be considered for valve planning, whereas a noncontrast chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT may be useful for vascular assessment, although a low-contrast volume scan is preferred. For other pre-TMVR patients, a 30 to 40 ml protocol can be used on a high-coverage or dualsource scanner. For pre-TTVR patients, a 30 to 40 ml contrast protocol can be used (see Protocol section).frequently have faster heart rates or arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. We suggest low-dose metoprolol (or diltiazem for patients with contraindications to beta-blockade) (see Pre-medication section) in stable patients with persistent rates above 100 beats/min. In settings of atrial fibrillation or frequent ectopy, prospective triggering may cause incorrect timing of acquisition or inability to scan (impact of heart rate and rhythm variability reduced in scanners with a greater number of detector rows) and high-pitch prospective helical scanning should be avoided instead considering retrospective, low-pitch approach to maximize overlap. Some vendors provide arrhythmia detection algorithms (that can delay scan and wait for return of regular rhythm) or postprocessing ECG editing, which may convert suboptimal datasets into good-quality reconstructed images(37).Table 5summarizes commonly encountered clinical scenarios with possible solutions and recommendations.",

O ver the past 2 decades, impressive technological advances in cardiac imaging have occurred that allow the visualization of anatomic details up to millimeter size in 3-dimensional (3D) format and assessment of myocardial deformation with unprecedented time resolution. Thus, it is not surprising that electrophysiologists have increasingly relied upon cardiac imaging for the diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent management of patients affected by various arrhythmic disorders. In this review (Central Illustration), we consider selected arrhythmic disorders for which contemporary cardiac imaging technology is integral to diagnostic and follow-up workflow: 1) prediction of arrhythmic risk for sudden cardiac death in selected patient populations; 2) catheter ablation of arrhythmias; and 3) cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING IN THE PREDICTION OF ARRHYTHMIC RISK FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH IN SELECTED PATIENT POPULATIONS Risk assessment of ventricular arrhythmias is of paramount importance in patients with heart disease. Although a recent meta-analysis documented that the rate of sudden cardiac death declined substantially among ambulatory patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (1), sudden cardiac death still represents a major cause of cardiovascular death. Current guidelines for the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in primary prevention are based mostly on LVEF values (2,3), despite the fact that this parameter is considered an unsatisfactory risk marker for sudden cardiac death. Indeed, a severely depressed LVEF is a low-specificity marker in differentiating risk for sudden cardiac death from risk for death associated with comorbidities or with the evolution of HF. Similarly, sudden cardiac death can occur in patients with normal or mildly depressed LVEFs. Therefore, abnormal myocardial structure (substrate) rather than volumetric and functional assessment is becoming the new reference for the evaluation of sudden cardiac death risk. Although sudden cardiac death in patients with prior myocardial infarction is attributed mainly to the result of re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias originating from surviving myocardial strain embedded into infarcted myocardium (Figure 1), the mechanism in nonischemic cardiomyopathy is less well understood but possibly related to fibrosis. Although multiple imaging modalities can be used to ascertain myocardial scar and fibrosis, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) holds the greatest promise for noninvasive risk assessment of ventricular arrhythmias. LGE by CMR has recently become a widely available clinical diagnostic procedure to visualize in vivo myocardial scar and fibrosis in patients with a variety of myocardial diseases and has emerged as the gold standard for identifying myocardial fibrosis.",

The investigators demonstrated that LGE represents a powerful predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmia events in patients with ventricular dysfunction of ischemic and nonischemic etiology (Figures 1 and 2). The composite arrhythmic endpoint was reached in 23.9% of patients with positive results on LGE testing (annualized event rate 8.6%) compared with 4.9% of patients with negative results (annualized event rate 1.7%) (p < 0.0001). LGE correlated with arrhythmic events in the different patient groups. In the overall population, the pooled odds ratio was 5.62 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.20 to 7.51), with no significant differences between ischemic and nonischemic patients. In a subgroup of 11 studies (n \u00bc 1,178) with mean LVEF #30%, the pooled odds ratio for the arrhythmic events increased to 9.56 (95% CI: 5.63 to 16.23), with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.30). Notably, the odds ratio was almost doubled in studies with mean LVEFs #30% compared with >30%, thus indicating that the prognostic power of LGE for ventricular arrhythmias is particularly strong in patients with severely depressed LVEFs. In addition, it indicates that even in a challenging group of patients such as those with LVEFs >30%, LGE can be used as a reliable marker for predicting arrhythmic events. The importance of evaluating LGE in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy has become relevant following the recent findings of DANISH (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) (5), which showed no reduction in overall mortality among patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy with high rates of guideline-recommended pharmacological therapy. More recently, Leyva et al. (6) studied nonischemic cardiomyopathy CRT patients with midwall fibrosis (n \u00bc 68) compared with those without midwall fibrosis (n \u00bc 184). They showed that CRT with a defibrillator was superior to CRT only in patients with midwall fibrosis (Figure 2); however, a large prospectively designed controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings. Advanced LGE post-processing techniques have been recently developed to better quantify myocardial scar tissue and to differentiate between scar core and border zone. The border zone extension and scar heterogeneity have been associated with inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and mortality prediction in patients with structural heart disease. This hypothesis was recently tested in the GAUDI-CRT (Life-Threatening Arrhythmic Events and Sudden Cardiac Death in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Patients) trial, which included 217 CRT patients (7). Pre-procedural LGE was obtained and analyzed to identify scar presence or absence, to quantify the amount of core and border zone, and to depict border zone distribution. During a median follow-up period of 35.5 months, appropriate ICD therapy or sudden cardiac death occurred in 25 patients (11.5%) and did not occur in CRT patients without myocardial scar. Among patients with scar (n \u00bc 125 [57.6%]), those with ICD therapies or sudden cardiac death exhibited greater scar mass (38.7 AE 34.2 g vs. 17.9 AE 17.2 g; p < 0.001), scar heterogeneity (border zone mass/scar mass ratio 49.5 AE 13.0 vs. 40.1 AE 21.7; p \u00bc 0.044), and border zone channel mass (3.6 AE 3 g vs. 1.8 AE 3.4 g; p \u00bc 0.018). Border zone mass and channel mass were the strongest predictors of arrhythmic events. An automated algorithm based on scar mass and absence of border zone channels identified 68.2% (n \u00bc 148) without ICD therapy or sudden cardiac death during follow-up with 100% negative predictive value (Figure 3, Video 1). Although the findings of this study require confirmation in larger and properly designed clinical trials, especially for the ICD population, they are extremely promising, as they indicate the possibility to accurately stratify risk in patients with HF on the basis of morphological and anatomic characteristics. Interestingly, Haugaa et al. (8) hypothesized that in patients after myocardial infarction, mechanical dispersion, as assessed by longitudinal strain speckletracking echocardiography, may be correlated with scar heterogeneity and therefore with risk for arrhythmias. In each patient, the investigators defined mechanical dispersion as the SD of 16 different time intervals to maximum myocardial deformation. They found that mechanical dispersion was greater in ICD patients with recorded ventricular arrhythmias compared with those without (85 AE",

Ao \u00bc aorta; LA \u00bc left atrium; LV \u00bc left ventricle. atrial fibrosis by CMR has presented unprecedented diagnostic and interventional opportunities. Consequently, pre-procedural assessment of atrial fibrosis to screen out patients undergoing pulmonary vein ablation may significantly help in improving the cost/benefit and risk/effectiveness ratios of catheter ablation in patients with AF. Likewise, visualization of fibrosis area and integration into 3D mapping systems to guide AF catheter ablation strategy (e.g., pulmonary vein isolation [PVI] or additional lines) may improve outcomes in patients undergoing catheter ablation. LGE on CMR can detect ablated regions, together with the evolution of their pattern and signal intensity over time, likely suggesting initial edema followed by scar formation; this possibility may further help in the management of those patients presenting with AF recurrence. Finally, visualization of fibrosis and inclusion in computer modeling is the next frontier in cardiac electrophysiology to develop patient-specific ablation strategy. The DECAAF study by Marrouche et al. (17) was the first multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with paroxysmal and persistent AF undergoing their first catheter ablation with PVI. CMR imaging was performed before ablation, and atrial fibrosis was quantified and classified into stages: 1 (<10% of the atrial wall); 2 ($10% to <20%); 3 ($20% to <30%); and 4 ($30%). The cumulative incidence of recurrent arrhythmia at 1 year for stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 15.3%, 32.6%, 45.9%, and 51.1%, respectively. This and several subsequent studies emphasize the importance of baseline imaging and quantification of atrial scar as a key predictor of procedural outcomes after PVI. Altogether, these studies are precursors to further investigations of substrate modification in addition to PVI, specifically",

            "text": "Imaging in Electrophysiology and Device Implantation in patients with severe atrial scarring as detected by CMR. Recent observations regarding the use of CMR for fibrosis imaging are, however, conflicting. A prospective single-center experience of 149 consecutive patients (64 persistent, 85 paroxysmal) undergoing AF ablation showed that delayed enhancement detected by CMR within the LA walls using standard clinical scanners and typical pulse sequence parameters was uncommon (n \u00bc 5, prevalence 3%) and, when present, did not correlate with AF type or risk for AF recurrence(18). These results clearly conflict with other investigational data(19). As suggested byPontecorboli et al. (20) in a recent review, it is clear that fibrosis and scar detection by CMR is not without pitfalls. Indeed, the development of standardized specific protocols and uniform cutoffs for fibrosis detection may lead to improved accuracy and reproducibility (Figure 6). Furthermore, relative atrial wall thickness (which is similar to the spatial resolution of CMR) represents a significant anatomic challenge in the 3D volumetric estimation of fibrosis and scar by this imaging technique. This becomes highly relevant when considering the experimental evidence that in the early stage of the disease, the fibrosis is mostly confined to the epicardial layers and progressively expands transmurally. Finally, although most of the studies have focused on fibrosis and scar assessment in the left atrium, structural changes have remained nearly unexplored in the right atrium, a cardiac chamber that is now becoming an ablation target in non-PVI-dependent AF. Outcomes among patients with persistent AF after PVI are still a matter of considerable debate. Although some may benefit from ablation, in others, sinus rhythm cannot be maintained for a reasonable amount of time despite extensive ablation (21). Parwani et al. (22) found that LA strain is lower in patients with recurrence of atrial arrhythmias after PVI (n \u00bc 55) than those without recurrence (LA strain 9.7 AE 2.4% vs. 16.2 AE 3.0%; p < 0.001), concluding that low (<10%) LA strain predicts recurrence of AF (hazard ratio: 6.4; 95% CI: 2.4 to 16.9; p < 0.001). This finding strongly suggests a profound link between electric and mechanical function, a research area that has not received sufficient attention. VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA.

Consistently, both studies showed that patients in which LV leads were placed in a region of latest mechanical activation had significantly reduced rates of HF hospitalization and death compared with those who had leads were placed otherwise. A large retrospective registry of 559 patients who had preprocedural CMR was performed demonstrated that patients with LV leads implanted in areas of myocardial fibrosis had a greater hazard ratio for cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization compared with those who had the leads were out of scar(31).More recently, a selection of multimodality imaging studies has shown the additional benefit for avoiding scar and targeting dyssynchrony among patients being treated with CRT (32,33). A common theme among these studies is the observed improvement in CRT response rate (approximately 15% to 20%) in patients implanted using imageguided approaches. Although the results from the growing number of image guidance studies are encouraging, 1 of the major limitations is that the data output in each study is analyzed separately from radiography, rather than being integrated together. The variability in the rotation of the left-and rightsided chambers relative to each other, however, hinders the determination of regional anatomy with regard to lead position. Behar et al. (34,35) have recently published the first clinical study to evaluate a platform that enables the real-time analysis and fusion of CMR-derived scar and dyssynchrony data to guide LV lead implantation. Upon completion of a routine CMR scan, the patient is transferred to the adjacent catheter laboratory while the imaging dataset is processed within 25 min. Segmentation of longand short-axis CMR sequences generates a 3D mesh along with a detailed location, burden, and transmurality of myocardial fibrosis. This process allows the identification of regions with the greatest dyssynchrony (Figure 8). Following a short registration step of the 3D model to the radiographic coordinate system, any subsequent radiographic acquisition is displayed with instantaneous overlay of the correctly oriented 3D model. Upon coronary venography, the 3D-derived model of the patient's left ventricle is instantaneously fused, thus enabling identification of the patient-specific target locations for LV lead placement and how they are subtended by the coronary venous tree (Figure 8). This platform was safely tested in 14 patients with conventional indications for CRT. It demonstrated that pacing with CMR-derived segments out of scar had more favorable electric properties and lower paced QRS duration than pacingFIGURE 6 Methods to Discriminate Left Atrial Fibrosis in Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Late Gadolinium Enhancement: Thresholding Techniques",

Estimated right ventricular systolic pressure increased from 29 mm Hg to 60 mm Hg (assuming a right atrial pressure of 5 mm Hg). The left ventricular ejection fraction increased to 70%.FIGURE 4 Patient A Lung Ultrasound Results",

            "text": "THE ASSESSMENT OF MYOCARDIAL SHORTENING AS AN INDEX OF MYOCARDIAL CONTRACTION IN HEALTHY PEOPLEHowever, long-term adaptations to internal or external stresses require structural changes in the cardiomyocytes. As a child grows to become an adult, the need for enhanced oxygen delivery to the increased body mass is met by an increase in circulating blood volume, and simultaneously, cardiomyocytes undergo physiological hypertrophy, leading to an increase in myocardial volume, thereby increasing the capacity of the heart to eject a greater volume of blood. If a healthy adult undergoes vigorous training (and becomes an elite athlete), further physiological hypertrophy leads to striking increases in myocardial volume and stroke volume, such that heart rate typically slows (1). If deconditioning occurs, there is a parallel decrease in circulating blood volume, myocardial volume, and stroke volume. In all of these instances, it is the volume of contracting cardiomyocytes that is a primary determinant of stroke volume.The ratio of stroke volume to myocardial volume defines the myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) (1,2). This metric can be calculated by echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, or computed tomography scans. The stroke volume can be estimated at the level of the left ventricular outflow tract or can be calculated from the 3-dimensional reconstruction of the ventricular volumes at end-diastole and endsystole. The myocardial volume is assessed by directly measuring the volume between the epicardium and endocardium by tomographic techniques, or alternatively, by dividing echocardiographic estimates of the left ventricular mass by 1.05 (the density ISSN 1936-878X/$36.00 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcmg.2019.12.021 *Editorials published in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging reflect the views of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of iJACC or the American College of Cardiology.

The MCF can distinguish pathological from physiological hypertrophy, whereas the LVEF cannot(13,14)  Furthermore, changes in the MCF are associated changes in functional capacity, which is not true for the LVEF(13,27). Interestingly, the MCF can distinguish patients with amyloidosis as a cause of HFpEF from those with other causes for increased wall thickness(15,16). Both diagnostically and prognostically, in patients with infiltrative or hypertrophic or with a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, the MCF outperforms the LVEF when measured by echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance scans(13)(14)(15)(28)(29)(30)(31). In epidemiological studies, values for the MCF can predict the incidence of cardiovascular events as well as the development of heart failure when the LVEF is normal(32)(33)(34). Thus, the MCF can identify meaningful myocardial disease in patients with HFpEF, which the measurement of LVEF cannot do(2,(22)(23)(24)(25)(26).Both MCF and strain are measures of myocardial contraction and shortening, and the reasons why MCF is superior to LVEF are very similar to the reasons why measures of strain are superior to LVEF in the assessment of systolic function(4,9,26,35). In many disease states, there is a very strong correlation between MCF and strain, and the 2 metrics may provide intriguing advantage of calculating the MCF is that it provides a numerical value that is familiar to clinicians because the range of normal values for MCF and LVEF are similar. However, a major advantage of the measurement of strain is that it is currently a routine part of echocardiography, even though strain measurements are not often incorporated into clinical decision-making. By contrast, current imaging programs do not yield measurements of MCF, and the use of LV mass to calculate the MCF is typically based on 1-dimensional diameter measurements, which are often unreliable in hearts with regional heterogeneity. Furthermore, patients with HFpEF commonly have atrial fibrillation and may have mitral regurgitation, which may further complicate the assessment of volumes by 2-dimensional echocardiography.Although these difficulties can be addressed by 3dimensional imaging (echocardiography or magnetic resonance), such techniques are not widely available.Nevertheless, upgrades of current echocardiographic programs would allow for the assessment of the MCF and initiate a process of enhancing physician familiarity with the metric because, despite the limitations of 2-dimensional methods in assessing volume and mass, the calculation of the MCF outperforms the measurement of the LVEF, both diagnostically and prognostically. Therefore, we propose the MCF as a metric to replace the LVEF. However, until there is widespread appreciation of the usefulness of the MCF, physicians should understand that the measurement of strain reflects the same physiological events as the MCF, yields insights that are superior to our current reliance on LVEF (2), and may provide a level of both temporal and regional granularity that is greater than the MCF.Recently, one of us called for a redefinition of HFrEF because the threshold commonly used to define a reduced LVEF did not fully identify pa-neurohormonal antagonists that could ameliorate the adverse remodeling process(12). In a similar manner, it is now time that we redefined our current approach to the assessment of myocardial contraction in patients with heart failure and a LVEF in the normal or near-normal range by shifting to metrics that can truly identify the abnormalities of myocardial shortening (MCF and strain), which are able to appropriately characterize patients whose left ventricles are severely diseased but not markedly enlarged.ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE: Dr. Milton Packer, Baylor Heart and Vascular Institute, 621 North Hall Street, Dallas, Texas 75226.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Antimalarial-Induced Cardiomyopathy Resembles Fabry Disease on Cardiac MRI Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are often treated with antimalarial agents (AMs), including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for prolonged periods of time because of their beneficial immunomodulatory effects. Although previously considered rare, AM-induced cardiomyopathy (AMIC) is likely underrecognized in clinical practice (1). Early detection of AMIC is critical given the high risk for mortality if AM treatment is continued. Although endomyocardial biopsy is considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of AMIC, it is not recommended for routine screening, because of the invasive nature of the procedure and inherent associated risks. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in AMIC have been described in limited case reports to date. We evaluated the diagnostic significance of cardiac MRI findings in AMIC in this retrospective study after obtaining Institutional Review Board approval. All patients with confirmed systemic lupus erythematosus who had undergone cardiac MRI at our institution between 2008 and 2018 were included. Exclusion criteria included prior myocardial infarction, suspected or known myocarditis, uncontrolled hypertension, and lack of clinical follow-up. The study population included 11 patients with AMIC (mean age 63.1 AE 7.9 years, 100% women) and 29 patients without AMIC (mean age 40.7 AE 14.8 years, 93% women). The diagnosis of AMIC was confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy in three patients (27%) and established by clinical consensus in eight patients (73%), on the basis of history of AM treatment, concordant transthoracic echocardiographic findings, elevated cardiac biomarker levels, and lack of an alternative cardiac diagnosis. All patients included in the study had been treated with AMs, although AM treatment had been stopped at the time of cardiac MRI in all patients with AMIC. Cardiac MRI studies were performed using 1.5-or 3.0-T scanners (Magnetom Avanto or Skyra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was assessed using a stack of short-axis cine steady-state free precession slices.Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging was performed 12 to 15 min following intravenous contrast administration. Quantitative LGE analysis was performed using a signal intensity threshold of 4 SDs, expressed as a percentage of left ventricular mass. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). A 2-tailed p value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were created to evaluate the ability of imaging findings to discriminate between patients with and without AMIC. Patients with AMIC were significantly older (p < 0.0001) and had longer AM treatment duration (median 22 years [interquartile range (IQR): 13 to 35 years] vs. 2 years [IQR: 1 to 10 years]; p < 0.0001) compared with those without AMIC. LVH was more common in patients with AMIC (91% vs. 25%; p < 0.001) and was typically concentric (9 of 10 [90%]). LGE was more common (100% vs. 21%; p < 0.0001), had higher quantitative extent (median 8% [IQR: 3% to 11%] vs. 0% [IQR: 0% to 0%]; p < 0.0001), and more frequently involved the basal inferolateral segment (90% vs. 4%; p < 0.0001) in patients with AMIC compared with those without (Figure 1). In patients with AMIC, the pattern of LGE was typically midwall (8 of 10 [80%]). The presence of both LVH and basal inferolateral LGE was significantly more common in patients with AMIC compared with those without (80% vs. 4%; p < 0.0001). The area under the curve to discriminate between patients with and those without AMIC was highest for the combination of basal inferolateral LGE and AM treatment duration $10 years (area under the curve 0.950 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.852 to 0.999], sensitivity 90% [95% CI: 56% to 100%], specificity 100% [95% CI: 88% to 100%]) and basal inferolateral LGE alone (area under the curve 0.933 [95% CI: 0.829 to 0.999], sensitivity 90% [95% CI: 56% to 100%], specificity 97% [95% CI: 82% to 100%]). Typical cardiac MRI findings in AMIC include concentric LVH and midwall LGE at the basal inferolateral segment. This resemblance to the cardiac MRI appearance typical of Fabry cardiomyopathy is strik-",

            "text": "There were several limitations of this study. There was potential ascertainment bias given the retrospective nature of the study and the fact that not all patients underwent endomyocardial biopsy. Patients with known or suspected myocarditis were excluded, which is an important consideration as there may be overlap in the distribution of LGE between AMIC and lupus myocarditis. T1 mapping is a newer cardiac MRI technique that may be useful in distinguishing between these disease processes, given that native T1 values are reduced in Fabry disease and are increased in lupus myocarditis(4,5).In conclusion, typical cardiac MRI findings in patients with AMIC include LVH and LGE at the basal inferolateral segment, similar to Fabry cardiomyopathy. These results may allow earlier detection of AMIC. However, future studies are required to confirm these findings in patients with biopsyconfirmed disease.

When using GLS to predict cardiotoxicity, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.79 and 0.83, respectively. Serving as a global measure of test performance, the AUC was 0.86, which indicates moderate predictive ability. This is consistent with the statement in the aforementioned expert consensus, which considers GLS the optimal parameter of deformation for the early detection of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction. This meta-analysis had 2 main limitations. First, relatively few studies were included. Second, the heterogeneity among the studies was significant for several factors, of which the most critical were the timing of assessments and the derivation of cutoffs.In conclusion, GLS measured by 2-dimensional STE provides moderate predictive accuracy for the pre-diction of cardiotoxicity in chemotherapy-treated patients. Because of the limitations of this study, more studies with a relatively standard procedure are warranted. The Coronary CTA VISION Study enrolled 995 patients (1), and the primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction within 30 days after elective surgery (1). The diagnosis of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death was adjudicated by physicians blinded to the imaging results (1). Perioperative risk was assessed using the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI), Acquisition and interpretation of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) have been previously reported (1). Patients were scored as normal, nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), obstructive CAD, or extensive obstructive disease. EAT volume was measured using QFAT version 3 by readers blinded to interpretation of coronary CTA and outcomes (3). EAT volume was indexed to body mass index (EAT BMI ).Seven hundred thirty-eight patients had computed tomographic images available for EAT analyses, of whom 436 patients (59.1%) were men; the mean age was 69.8 AE 8.7 years. Patients who experienced MACE were more likely to have CAD, peripheral arterial disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients underwent a total of 771 surgical procedures (213 vascular, 67 intra-abdominal, 431 orthopedic, 8 major spine, and 52 other). Totals of 253, 306, 140, and 39 patients had RCRI scores of 0, 1, 2, and $3, respectively. On the basis of the results of coronary CTA, 74 patients (10.1%) had normal coronary arteries, 301 patients (41.0%) had nonobstructive CAD, 267 patients (31.2%) had obstructive disease, and 96 patients (13.1%) had extensive obstructive CAD. The mean EAT and EAT BMI were 133.8 AE 52.9 cm 3 and 4.5 AE 1.7 cm 3 /kg/m 2 , respectively. First, second, and third EAT BMI tertile ranges were 0.87 to 3.59, 3.60 to 5.12, and $5.13 cm 3 /kg/m 2 , respectively. MACE occurred in 59 patients (7.9%). The mean EAT BMI was 5.4 AE 1.7 and 4.7 AE 1.7 cm 3 /kg/m 2 in patients with and those without MACE (p < 0.001). MACE occurred in 10 patients (1.4%), 15 patients (2.0%), and 34 patients (4.6%) in the first, second, and third tertiles, respectively. Univariate analyses and multivariate analysis were performed to identify predictors of MACE. RCRI, coronary CTA, and EAT BMI were all associated with MACE. Compared with patients in the first tertile, patients in the third tertile had an increased hazard ratio (3.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.75 to 7.15), and there was a trend toward increased hazard ratio in the second tertile (1.51; 95% CI: 0.68 to 3.37). The upper tertile of EAT BMI was an independent and incremental predictor of MACE over RCRI and coronary CTA. Compared with patients in the first tertile, patients in the third tertile had an increased hazard ratio (2.81; 95% CI: 1.36 to 5.80), and there was a trend toward increased hazard ratio in the second tertile (1.39; 95% CI: 0.62 to 3.13). There was no interaction among coronary CTA category, RCRI, and EAT BMI . Risk-adjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for each of the EAT BMI tertiles",

This study was limited by selection biases inherent to the study design. This particular population of veterans consisted mostly of older, white men with significant smoking histories. Our definition of gout may be less accurate than American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria. Diagnosis codes and events may be underestimated because of limitations inherent in extracting data or because care outside the Department of Veterans Affairs was not fully captured.Additional studies are required to assess the mechanistic relationship among uric acid, gouty inflammation, and calcific atherosclerosis leading to increased events in this population and whether this population would derive particular benefit from more aggressive gout-or inflammation-targeted clinical strategies to reduce cardiovascular events.",
