Three accessory proteins encoded by diverse retroviruses, HIV-1 Nef, EIAV S2, and MLV Glycogag, each independently disrupt SERINC5 antiviral activity, by redirecting SERINC5 from the site of virion assembly on the plasma membrane to an internal RAB7 + endosomal compartment. Pseudotyping retroviruses with particular glycoproteins, e.g., the vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (VSV G), renders the infectivity of particles resistant to inhibition by virion-associated SERINC5. To better understand viral determinants for SERINC5-sensitivity, the effect of SERINC5 was assessed using HIV-1, MLV, and M-PMV virion cores, pseudotyped with glycoproteins from Arenavirus, Coronavirus, Filovirus, Rhabdovirus, Paramyxovirus, and Orthomyxovirus genera. Infectivity of particles, pseudotyped with HIV-1, amphotropic-MLV, or influenza virus glycoproteins, was decreased by SERINC5, whether the core was provided by HIV-1, MLV, or M-PMV. Particles generated by all three cores, and pseudotyped with glycoproteins from either avian leukosis virus-A, human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K), ecotropic-MLV, HTLV-1, Measles morbillivirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV), Marburg virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), or VSV, were insensitive to SERINC5. In contrast, particles pseudotyped with M-PMV, RD114, or rabies virus (RABV)",

One of these retroviruses causes tumors in mice, a second anemia in horses, and a third causes AIDS. SERINC5 is incorporated into retrovirus particles where it blocks entry into target cells, via a mechanism that is dependent on the viral glycoprotein. Here we demonstrate that retroviruses pseudotyped with glycoproteins from several non-retroviruses are also inhibited by SERINC5, suggesting that enveloped viruses other than retroviruses may also be inhibited by SERINC5. Additionally, we found that sensitivity to SERINC5 is determined by the retrovirus core, as well as by the glycoprotein. By better understanding how SERINC5 inhibits viruses we hope to extend fundamental understanding of virus replication and of the native role of SERINC5 in cells, and perhaps to advance the development of new antiviral strategies.",

Nef is a multifunctional accessory protein that downregulates CD4, MHC, and TCR from the cell surface (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Nef also enhances HIV-1 infectivity in single-round infection experiments (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) by overcoming the antiviral effects of SERINC5 and SERINC3 (17, 18) , though, of the two, SERINC5 is the more potent restriction factor. SERINC5 is incorporated into budding virions where it inhibits subsequent fusion of the virion membrane with target cell membranes. Nef counteracts SERINC5 by removing it from the cell surface so that it is not incorporated into nascent virions (17) (18) (19) (20) .",

No correlation was observed between SERINC5 sensitivity and the route of viral entry mediated by the viral glycoprotein.

The ability of a viral glycoprotein to re-localize a normally plasma membrane localized antiviral protein has been previously shown for HIV-2 Env and human BST2 (38). Thus, we reasoned that viral glycoproteins may confer resistance to SERINC5 activity by re-localizing SERINC5 to an internal membrane compartment. To test this, we compared SERINC5 incorporation into HIV-1 virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with the various glycoproteins shown in Fig 1A. We found that HIV-1 VLPs universally incorporated SERINC5 irrespective of the viral glycoprotein present ( Figure 2 ). In replicate blotting, only HERV-K Env showed a consistently lower level of SERINC5 incorporation into viral particles (data not shown). However, this observation is likely to be caused by pleiotropic effects of cells transfected with this glycoprotein, as cell growth was significantly reduced compared to other transfections, and reduced levels of Gag and GFP were also observed ( Fig. 2 , data not shown).",

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/780577 doi: bioRxiv preprint DISCUSSION Initial reports indicated that the viral glycoprotein is a determinant of sensitivity to SERINC5 antiviral activity (17, 18, 25, 26) and suggested that viral glycoproteins which mediate fusion via a pH-dependent, endocytic entry pathway are resistant to SERINC5 antiviral activity (17, 24) . Here, to examine these issues further, pseudotypes using glycoproteins from diverse families of enveloped viruses were assessed for sensitivity to restriction by SERINC5. We observed that SERINC5 restricted virions pseudotyped with glycoproteins from several retroviruses (HIV-1, A-MLV, RD114, and M-PMV), influenza A (Orthomyxoviridae), and rabies (Rhabdoviridae). To our knowledge, this is the first time antiviral activity of SERINC5 has been described for a non-retroviral glycoprotein. As the glycoproteins of these viruses were studied as retroviral pseudotypes, it remains to be established if the infectivity of authentic influenza or rabies viruses are affected by SERINC5, or other SERINC family members.",

This observation was unexpected given that lenti-and gammaretroviruses encode accessory factors that counteract SERINC5 activity.

A previous report demonstrated similar magnitude inhibition for RD114-pseudotyped MLV by endogenous SERINC activity (24). Regardless, RD114 showed little sensitivity to SERINC5 when pseudotyped onto HIV-1 cores. Neutralization by monoclonal antibodies that target the membrane-proximal domain of HIV-1 glycoprotein is altered by the presence of SERINC5 (19, 25) . Given that MA, the membrane proximal domain of gag makes contacts with the retroviral TM (40, 41), one can imagine that SERINC5 has the potential to influence interactions between MA and TM in the HIV-1 virion that are essential for infectivity. In similar fashion, SERINC5 might influence retroviral core interactions by the heterologous glycoproteins tested here, for which SERINC5 restriction activity was core-dependent, i.e., the rabies virus, MPMV, and RD114 glycoproteins.

The HIV indicator cell line TZM-bl (Cat#8129) was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH) and were deposited by Drs. John C. Kappes and Xiaoyun Wu (43). Both cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 mM HEPES. Virus production, and transductions. All viral stocks were generated by Mirus TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) mediated transfection of HEK293 cells. 12 well plates were ) were co-transfected with 155 ng glycoprotein expression vector. For the production of pseudotyped MLV virions 625 ng pLXIN-GFP (46) and 465 ng pCS2+mGP (47) were co-transfected with 155 ng glycoprotein expression vector. For the production of pseudotyped M-PMV virions, 1090 ng pSARM-EGFP (48) was co-transfected with 155 ng glycoprotein expression vector. In all cases, either 100ng pcDNA-SERINC5 (17) or 110 ng empty pcDNA3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) vector was included in these transfections. The morning following transfection medium was replaced with fresh DMEM and virus containing supernatant was harvested 48 hours after media change. This supernatant was spun for 10 minutes at 2,500 x g to remove cellular debris and stored at 4\u00b0C until used for transduction. HEK293 or TZMbl cells were seeded at 1x10 5 or 5x10 5 , respectively, in 12-well plates 24 hours prior to transduction. For experiments involving ecotropic MLV or avian leukosis virus A, TransIT-LT1 and the subsequent day these transfected cells were split and plated for transductions. For transductions, culture supernatant was replaced with three dilutions of virus containing supernatant and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Virus containing medium was replaced and cells were incubated for an additional 48 hours, following which they were trypsinized and assessed for GFP expression via fluorescent activated cell sorting using the Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Analysis was performed using FlowJo Macintosh v10.1 (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR). Virion purification and western blotting. Viral pseudotypes were produced as above, except transfections were performed in 6-well plates so the number of cells plated and DNA introduced were doubled. The resulting virus-containing supernatant was overlayed on 20% sucrose in TNE buffer (50 mM TRIS, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH7.4) and viruses were pelleted via ultracentrifugation for 2 hours at 125,000 x g at 4\u00b0C using an SW55-Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Following centrifugation, tubes were washed with 1 ml of ice cold PBS and viral pellets were directly lysed in 50 \u03bc l 2x Laemmli buffer containing 50 mM TCEP [Tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine] incubated at room temp for 5 minutes. Cell lysates were prepared in parallel by washing transfected HEK293s once with 1 ml ice cold PBS, detaching from the plate by scraping, pelleting, and subsequently lysing for 20 minutes on ice in 150 \u03bc l SERINC lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP [Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine], 1% DDM [n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside]) containing cOmplete mini protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 10,000 x g and 4\u00b0C, following which supernatants were transferred to a new centrifuge tube and protein content was quantified via Reducing Agent Compatible BCA Assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA)Volumes of lysate corresponding to equal protein content were combined 1:1 with 2x Laemmli buffer containing 50 mM TCEP and incubated at room temp for 5 minutes.One half of the denatured viral pellet and approximately 8 \u03bc g protein from cellular lysates were run on 4-15% gradient acrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.SERINC5 levels were assessed via C-terminal HA tag using the mouse monoclonal HA.11 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) at 1 \u03bc g/ml in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE). HIV-1 p24 was detected using human monoclonal antibody 241-D (49) at a in Odyssey blocking buffer. MLV p30 was detected with rat monoclonal antibody R187 (50) from unpurified culture medium following five days of culturing the R187 hybridoma (ATCC, Manassas, VA). This medium was diluted 1:200 in Odyssey blocking buffer. Cellular actin was detected using mouse anti-actin monoclonal ACTN05 (C4) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bc g/ml in Odyssey blocking buffer. All blots were developed using 1:10,000 dilutions of 680RD or 800CW fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE) in Odyssey blocking buffer. Imaging of blots was performed using an Odyssey CLx system (LI-Cor Biotechnology) at a resolution of 84 \u03bc m using the 'high quality' setting. Quantitation of bands was done using the box tool in the Odyssey software package with adjacent pixels to the box serving as reference background levels for background subtraction.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe following reagent was obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: Anti-HIV-1 p24 Monoclonal (241-D) from Dr. Susan Zolla-Pazner.
