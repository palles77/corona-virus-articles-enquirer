We sought to describe the radiographic and CT findings of severe adenovirus community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in eight immunocompetent adults. Methods: We reviewed systematically chest imaging manifestations of laboratory-confirmed severe adenovirus pneumonia in eight immunocompetent adults from April 2012 to April 2014. Results: All patients showed abnormal results on initial chest radiograph and CT, with the exception of one normal initial chest radiograph. The abnormalities of the initial chest radiographs were unilateral (n=4) or bilateral (n=3), including consolidation (n=4), dense patchy opacity (n=3), ground glass opacity (GGO) (n=1), and pleural effusion (n=1). The initial CT findings consisted of unilateral (n=5) and bilateral (n=3) abnormalities, including consolidation (n=8), GGO (n=2), pleural effusion (n=3) and small nodules (n=1).",

Lower respiratory tract specimens of 128 patients were sent to the Institute of Medical Biology of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, to test for respiratory viruses. Eight sporadic cases were confirmed as adenovirus infection through sputum (n=2), tracheal aspirates (n=4) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (n=2) by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Adenovirus serotyping were also performed ( There were eight patients (male-female ratio, 3:1) with an age range from 22 to 52 years (mean age, 35.9 years) ( Table 1) . Six patients had no significant underlying disease, while one patient had a history of cerebral infarction and hypertension, and another patient had hypertension, type 2 diabetes and asthma. None of the patients were severely immunocompromised. The major symptoms at presentation were high fever(>39 \u2103) (n=8), dyspnea (n=8), cough (n=8), ARDS (n=8), septic shock (n=4), hemoptysis (n=4), chest pain (n=3), diarrhea (n=2), myalgias (n=1), and sore throat (n=1). The time interval from illness onset to admission was 1-15 days with a median of 6 days. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 2 (APACHE II) score at admission ranged from 4 to 17 [mean, 12.5\u00b14.8 (SD)]. Empirical broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics were given to all the patients, while one was prescribed oseltamivir prior to the confirmation of viral pneumonia in our study. Four patients received adjuvant intravenous immunoglobulin for 3-5 days, while five received corticosteroids for 3-7 days, including hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone. Six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation with a duration range from 8 to 23 days and a median of 11.5 days. The sole death was a 52-year-old man with three comorbidities, who died after 23 days of mechanical ventilation.",

The abnormal findings of initial CT scans were unilateral (n=5) or bilateral (n=3), including consolidation (n=8), GGO (n=2) (Figure 2 ) and small nodules (n=1) ( Table 1) . Pleural effusion was found in three patients, being bilateral in one out of three. On the initial CT scans, focal consolidation ( Figures 3A) were the main findings in six patients whose initial CT scans were examined within one week after illness onset. Predominant bilateral consolidation with adjacent GGO were seen in one patient's initial CT which was performed seven days after illness onset. Predominant GGO with adjacent consolidation were observed in one patient whose initial CT was examined nine days after illness onset ( Figure 2 ). All eight patients had follow-up chest CT images. The time interval between initial CT and the first followup CT ranged from 2 to 7 days with a median of 6 days [mean, 5.4\u00b11.6 (SD) days]. The first follow-up CT scans which were performed within ten days of illness onset Figure 3B) ; including, more extensive unilateral (1 of 6) or bilateral (5 of 6) areas of consolidation, and unilateral (2 of 6) or bilateral (4 of 6) pleural effusion. Follow-up CT scans of most patients had mixed patterns showing predominant consolidation with adjacent GGO. Numbers of lung lobe involved by consolidation in all eight patients were significantly more at the time of maximum severity (2 to 5, mean 4 lobes ) than at the presentation (1 to 4, mean 1.7 lobes). In accordance with chest radiographs, CT parenchymal abnormalities began to absorb at about two weeks of illness onset ( Figure 3C,D) . The serial CT findings showed no appearances of fibrosis such as reticular opacities, cystic lesions, or traction bronchiectasis.",

However, similar to our study, bilateral infiltrates or consolidation were also reported frequently in adenovirus pneumonia (3, 7, 10, 18) . As Gu concluded, single lobar or segmental consolidation was more common in patients without ARDS, while patients with ARDS had bilateral and multilobar lung consolidation (11) . In our study, focal consolidation were the primary findings within one week after illness onset, which indicates that multilobar involvement rapidly derived from single lobe infiltrates in severe adenovirus pneumonia with ARDS. Consistent with Sun's findings (10), delay from onset to a single lobar consolidation, then to bilateral multilobar lung infiltrates were about one week in our study, when significant deterioration was observed.",
