According to the report by Yang et al., the 28-day mortality was 61.5% for a group of critically ill COVID-19 patients. 5 Many patients with mild symptoms presented a sudden progressive to severe or critical illness. 6 Hence, to identify simple and efficient predictor is vital for us to provide strengthened attention and treatment to the targeted patients and thus to reduce the mortality of COVID-19. Similar to SARS, critical patients with COVID-19 presented higher plasma levels of cytokines, suggesting the involvement of inflammatory storm in the pathogenesis of disease progression. 7 C-reactive protein (CRP), a routinely measured inflammatory marker, was increased in most patients with COVID-19 and associated with disease severity.

There were 86 cases of hypertension, 32 cases of cerebrovascular diseases, 45 cases of diabetes, 26 cases of coronary heart disease, 23 cases of chronic pulmonary disease, 16 cases of cirrhosis, and 12 cases of anemia. Most patients who died were males, aged over 60 years or with chronic diseases. Twenty-one (7.0%) patients had a history of smoking and 33 (11.1%) had a history of drinking. The median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 9 (6-12) days. No significant difference existed in history of smoking or drinking, and days from illness onset to hospitalization between survivors and non-survivors.",

In this study, the median age of non-survivors was 71 (64-80) years, significantly higher than 57 (40-69) years in survivors. Further, age was an independent predictor of adverse outcome and discriminator of severe/critical illness, which suggested that old people are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and more likely to develop severe/critical disease. 5, 6, 8 Elevated neutrophil count was observed in patients with severe illness compared to those with non-severe illness. 7 In this study, admission neutrophil count was a moderate predictor of clinical outcome and disease severity. These results implied that factors contributing to raised neutrophil count, such as secondary infection, excessive inflammatory stress or glucocorticoids use, might exacerbate disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count was commonly observed in patients with COVID-19, which was considered a possible critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality. 12, 13 Reduced CD4 and CD8 T cell count accompanied by their over-activation might contribute to the impaired immunity and disease progression in patients with COVID-19. 12 In this study, significant discrepancy was observed in lymphocyte count between patients with different outcome or disease severity.

Pulmonary diseases with inflammatory features usually raise serum CRP level in response to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1 or TNF-\u03b1. 16, 17 Hence, markedly elevated serum CRP level in non-survivors or patients with severe/critical illness in this study indicated excessive inflammatory response, which was consistent with raised serum pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in COVID-19 patients. 18, 19 The roles of CRP in case of diseases may involve host defense and inflammation. In response to inflammatory onset, CRP binds to pathogens and promotes their elimination by phagocytic cells, functioning as the first line of innate host defense. Besides, CRP can exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neutrophils chemotaxis. 20 However, by up-regulating expression of adhesion molecules, and pro-inflammatory IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1, CRP can also exert pro-inflammatory effects. 21 Controversial results of serum CRP level were observed in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 22, 23 The association between high serum CRP level and a favorable outcome was found in adult patients with ALI/ARDS. 22 In elderly patients with ALI, however, high serum CRP level correlated to higher mortality, 23 which is consistent to our findings in patients with COVID-19.

Second, some patients with critical illness were not admitted to intensive care unit as they should be due to shortage of resources, which undoubtedly had a negative impact on the outcome of those patients. Third, patients were not recruited consecutively due to exclusion of some cases without serum CRP detection on admission, which might bring about selective bias. Fourth, serum CRP level correlates with the degree of inflammatory response, 24 therefore, changes in CRP over time might provide more information about disease prognosis. However, no continuous CRP values over time were included in this study since it was designed to explore the potential of admission CRP in outcome prediction.",

The AUCs of these discriminators were 0.828 (95% CI: 0.781-0.875) (z=13.69, p<0.001), 0.729 (95% CI: 0.671-0.786) (z=7.79, p<0.001), and 0.783 (95% CI: 0.731-0.835) (z=10.69, p<0.001), respectively.

Subgroup analysis in adverse outcome prediction was performed for patients according to different disease severity on admission. In this case, age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were still identified as independent risk factors of adverse outcome in patients with severe or critical illness (table 3). Hosmer and Lemeshow test showed a good model adequacy (\u03c7 2 =4.99, p=0.759). The AUCs of age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP for adverse outcome prediction were 0.726 (95% CI: 0.646 -0.806) (z=5.53, p<0.001), 0.787 (95% CI: 0.716 -0.859) (z=7.84, p<0.001), 0.697 (95% CI: 0.618 -0.767) (z=4.76, p<0.001), and 0.832 (95% CI: 0.768 -0.896) (z=10.23, p<0.001), respectively. The AUC of CRP was comparable to that of neutrophil count (z=0.98, p = 0.326), but significantly higher than those of age (z=2.06, p = 0.039) and platelet count (z=2.70, p = 0.007). With a cut-off value of 56.3, CPR showed sensitivity 81.3%, specificity 71.4%, PPV 74.7%, and NPV 78.6%. For patients with ordinary illness, CRP was identified as an only independent predictor of adverse outcome (table 3), with AUC 0.989 (95% CI: 0.967-1.000) (z=44.04, p<0.001). With a cut-off value 0f 80.9, CRP showed sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 95.6%, PPV 40.0%, and NPV 100.0%. Independent discriminators of severe/critical illness on admission Among 150 male patients, 91 were diagnosed as severe/critical illness, while 59 were diagnosed as ordinary illness at admission. Patients with severe/critical illness tended to present a larger percent of male gender compared to patients with ordinary illness (58% vs. 41.8%, =7.72, p=0.005). A much lower percent of chronic diseases was observed in patients with ordinary illness (29.1% vs. 59.9%, =28.43, p<0.001). Compared to patients with ordinary illness, patients with severe/critical illness showed older age (median 67 (57-75) years vs. 42 (32-57) years, p<0.001) and more duration from",
