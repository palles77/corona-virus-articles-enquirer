According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 10 to 20 percent of cases progress to the stage of requiring respiratory support. The exact cause of SARS is still under investigation; however, scientists have identified a type of coronavirus in patients with SARS. The common, known types of coronavirus cause upper respiratory illnesses. SARS coronavirus (SARS Co-V) may survive in the environment for up to several days. Laboratory studies at the CDC and around the world are currently studying SARS Co-V to determine what factors and conditions support its survival outside the body.",
