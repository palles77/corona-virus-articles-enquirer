Based on the inter-nucleotide distance sequence, we propose the conditional multinomial distribution profile for the complete genomic sequence. These profiles can be used to define a very simple, computationally efficient, alignment-free, distance measure that reflects the evolutionary relationships between genomic sequences. We use this distance measure to classify chromosomes according to species of origin, to build the phylogenetic tree of 24 complete genome sequences of coronaviruses. Our results demonstrate the new method is powerful and efficient.",

            "text": "A great volume of available genomic data has made possible analysis of large sets of organisms at the whole genome scale. However, given that most genomes contain millions to billion nucleotides, traditional molecular analysis methods based on multiple sequence alignment become impractical due to their high computation complexity (Vinga and Almeida, 2003) . Consequently, considerable efforts have been made to seek for the alignment-free method for sequence analysis. The first, mainly based on graphical representation of the sequence, is very convenient for studying several selected cases (Liao et al., 2005; Jeffrey, 1990; Nandy, 1994; Nandy and Nandy, 1995, 2003; Randic and Vracko, 2000; Randic et al. 2001 Randic et al. , 2003a Randic et al. ,b, 2006 Randic and Balaban, 2003; Randic, 2008; Zhang and Zhang, 1994) . One of the aim of graphical representation is to identity regions of interest or the distribution of base along the sequence visually (Zhang and Zhang, 1994) . The second approach, has been proposed to characterize the DNA sequence (Akhtar et al., 2007) . For this purpose one has to find representative descriptors that characterize an abstract mathematical representation of the biological sequence (Dai et al., 2006; He and Wang, 2002) . A commonly used numerical characterization of the sequence is to consider binary sequences that describe the position of each nucleotide (Voss, 1992) . Different approaches are described in a recent review (Nandy et al., 2006) . Nair and Mahalashmi (2005) proposed the inter-nucleotide distance as a new DNA numerical profile. Any DNA sequence can be converted into a unique numerical sequence with the same length. In the representation, each number represents the distance of a nucleotide to the next occurrence of the same nucleotide. Meanwhile Nair and Mahalashmi (2005) employed discrete Fourier transformation to the inter-nucleotide distance sequence and indicated that this method has a discriminatory capability for highlighting the promoter region of gene sequence. However, Akhtar and Epps (2008) proved that it has poor accuracy in the exon prediction. Afreixo et al. (2009) developed a new method to analyze the inter-nucleotide distance sequence and extracted some interesting features of the DNA sequence. Four nucleotide internucleotide distance distributions and a global distance distribution were given to each genome sequence. In each nucleotide internucleotide distance distribution, only the total number of three other nucleotides was considered (Afreixo et al., 2009) . In fact, we can extract more information about the genome sequence from their inter-nucleotide distance sequences.",

In case of the inter-nucleotide distance sequence about nucleotide A, the number of the nucleotide C, the number of the nucleotide G and the number of the nucleotide T would follow multinomial distribution given that inter-nucleotide distance is k. This multinomial distribution will be called the conditional multinomial distribution. The relative error vector derived from the conditional multinomial distribution then can be used as a genomic signature that identifies each species. This approach allows us to perform comparative analysis between complete genome sequences. In fact, we propose a new evolutionary information representation, complete multinomial composition vector (CMCV), by using a collection of multinomial composition vectors. These multinomial composition vectors are built on the relative error vectors of conditional multinomial distributions with k, where k is within a range. The range of k is determined to ensure that the CMCV contains the largest amount of evolutionary information hidden in the whole genomic data. We then define the evolutionary distance between two genomes based on their complete multinomial composition vectors. The proposed method is tested by phylogenetic analysis on 24 coronavirus genomes. Our results demonstrate that the new method is powerful and efficient.",

The name, accession number, abbreviation, and genome length for the 24 genomes are listed in Table 2 . Generally, coronavirus can be classified into three groups according to serotypes. Group I and group II contain mammalian viruses, whereas group III contains only avian. Many investigations have attempted to identify the phylogenetic position of SARS-CoVs. However, this is still a controversial topic-alignment-based methods showed that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any groups and form a new group (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) ; maximum likelihood tree built from a fragment of the spike protein preferred SARS-CoVs clustering with group II (Li o and Goldman, 2004); while an information-based method, which makes use of the whole genome sequences, indicated that SARS-CoVs are close to the group I rather than from a new group (Yang et al., 2005) . Based on the complete multinomial composition vector, we build the phylogenetic tree of the 24 coronaviruses listed in Table 2 .

In the case of k \u00bc1, there is no nucleotide between two adjacent nucleotides. In the case of k\u00bc2, there is only one nucleotide between two adjacent nucleotides. Therefore the multinomial composition value of a certain pattern a is zero. The CMCV does not contain these multinomial composition values. Certainly, a large value of k will give a vector containing finer evolutionary information. However, many patterns will not occur in the conditional multinomial distribution with a large value of k. From the view of information theory, some information may be lost and noise will dominate if a large value of k is considered. To determine the upper bound of the value of k, we will introduce a scoring scheme to estimate how important a conditional multinomial distribution is. w 2 \u00c0Test scoring scheme: For a fixed k, let a be a pattern in the conditional multinomial distribution, with its multinomial composition value p\u00f0a,ijk\u00de in genome i (could be found in k \u00c0MCV). Define the expected multinomial composition value for pattern a to be the average of all composition values across all whole genomes, and denoted as, E\u00bdp\u00f0ajk\u00de i.e. E\u00bdp\u00f0ajk\u00de \u00bc \u00f01=n\u00de P n i \u00bc 1 p\u00f0a,ijk\u00deFassuming n genomes in the dataset. The standard w 2 \u00c0test measures the deviation of a set of values from its expected value by summing up the deviations of each element. Clearly, the higher value it has, the more valuable pattern a is. Thus, we may define a score for the conditional multinomial distribution with a fixed k as",

Moreover, we can define the relative ratio of information involved in a certain conditional multinomial distribution with a fixed k as the k \u00c0MCV to the CMCV which will involve the k\u00c0 MCV. Form Table 3 , we can clearly see that the relative ratio of 7\u00c0 MCV is the maximum 839 1408 .

DNA sequence databases have accumulated much data on biological evolution during billions of years, consequently novel concepts and methods are urgent need to reveal the biological functions of DNA sequences information, to investigate relationships of DNA sequences with biological evolution, cellular function, genetic mechanism and occurrence of illness. In this paper, we propose four conditional multinomial distributions about each nucleotide for complete genome sequence based on the inter-nucleotide distance sequences. From the conditional multinomial distribution profiles about nine chromosomes, we note that the relative error vector between the measured conditional multinomial distribution and the reference conditional multinomial distribution can be used as a genomic signature, thus allowing the comparison of species. Therefore, it is straightforward to generate a phylogenetic tree based on the Euclidean distances of complete multinomial composition vectors. In order to test the validity of our method, we select the complete genome sequences of 24 coronaviruses which were used by Liu et al. (2007) . The phylogenetic tree can be gotten through the distance matrices using the UPGMA method. Fig. 4 is the phylogenetic tree of the 24 genome sequences based on the distance matrix of the complete multinomial composition vector, using UPGMA method. We find that the tree is mainly consistent with the tree constructed by Liu et al. (2007) . Fig. 4 also indicates that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any groups and form a new group.",
