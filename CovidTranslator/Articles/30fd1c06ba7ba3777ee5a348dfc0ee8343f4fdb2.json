This study aims to determine the proportions of influenza and noninfluenza viruses among SARI patients and to determine the severity of SARI and its associated factors. The data of SARI patients who were admitted to SARI surveillance sites at Al Johory hospital in Sana'a and Al Wahdah hospital in Aden city during the period 2011-2016 were analyzed. The proportions of positive influenza viruses (type A, B) and noninfluenza viruses (respiratory syncytial, adenovirus, human parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, and fatality rate among SARI patients were calculated. A total of 1811 of SARI patients were admitted during 2011-2016. Of those, 78% were <15 years old. A total of 89 (5%) patients had influenza viruses and 655 (36%) had noninfluenza viruses. The overall ICU admission rate was 40% and the case-fatality rate was 8%. Infection by influenza type (A, B) and mixed (adenovirus, human parainfluenza) was significantly associated with lower ICU admission. Age <15 years old, infection with influenza B, pre-existence of chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site were significantly associated with higher fatality rate among patients. In conclusion; SARI patients in Yemen had a high ICU admission and case-fatality rates. Influenza type B, chronic diseases, and admission to Aden site are associated with higher fatality rate. Expanding surveillance sites and panel of laboratory tests to involve other pathogens will help to provide accurate diagnosis for SARI etiology and give more comprehensive picture. Training staff for SARI case management will help to reduce severe outcomes.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a group of diseases that are caused by different microorganisms where viral etiologies are responsible for 80% of cases. 1 Influenza and noninfluenza viruses are responsible for significant annual morbidity and mortality across all age groups. 2 On average, influenza viruses infect 5% to 15% of the global population, resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and between 260 000 and 650 000 deaths every year worldwide. The heaviest burden is among high-risk groups that include pregnant women, children under 59 months, the elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions. 3 In 2015, it was estimated to cause 3.2 million hospital admissions and 59 600 hospital deaths in children below 5 years of age worldwide. 4, 5 Efforts were made to assess the role of noninfluenza viruses in morbidity and mortality of ARIs. Surveillance for hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) is an important public health tool used to identify etiologies to understand the disease, track changes in circulating influenza viruses and as an alert mechanism for potential pandemic viruses 6 For that purpose, the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance (EMARIS) network was established in 2007 and initiated sentinel-site surveillance for SARI in Egypt, Jordan, and Oman. This was achieved through the collaboration of Ministries of Health, partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU3), and the World Health Organization (WHO). 7 Yemen joined EMARIS network in 2010 and established 2 surveillance sites for SARI in Sana'a and Aden. However, limited information about SARI, influenza, and noninfluenza respiratory viruses is available in Yemen. Few studies were carried out to describe the mortality after influenza epidemic, 8 estimate the proportion of influenza and noninfluenza viruses and mortality among SARI patients, 9 and to understand the clinical characteristics of SARI associated with most detected pathogens during 2014-2015. 10 Still, there is gap in the information related to the role of influenza and noninfluenza viruses in severe outcome of SARI and associated factors. This study aimed to determine the proportions of influenza and noninfluenza virus among SARI patients, and assess the severity of SARI and its associated factors in Yemen.",
