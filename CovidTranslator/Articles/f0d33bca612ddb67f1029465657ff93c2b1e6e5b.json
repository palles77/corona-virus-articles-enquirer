During the ribosomal frameshift event, the gag open reading frame is shifted -1 nt to allow in-phase reading of the pal open reading frame. A consensus frameshift signal sequence of GGGAAAC within the gag-pal overlap region of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) has been identified followed by a sequence that has the potential for a pseudoknot tertiary structure. Using recombinant baculoviruses in which the frameshift occurs efficiently, the consensus sequence has been shown to be the site of the frameshift event. A mutation creating a termination codon just downstream of the putative frameshift signal sequence but upstream of the potential pseudoknot structure made a shorter gag product, but did not affect the efficiency of frameshifting.",

In higher eucaryotes, the majority of examples of this form of regulation comes from retroviruses (Hizi et al., 1987; Jacks and Varmus, 1985; Jacks er a/., 1987 Jacks er a/., , 1988a Moore eta/., 1987; Wilson eta/., 1988) and an avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Brierley et a/., 1987 (Brierley et a/., , 1989 . In retroviruses, the frameshift event occurs within the overlap region between the gag and the pal genes. The frameshift is required to express the pal gene product as a gag-pal fusion precursor which is finally processed into functionally mature proteins during virus assembly. In retroviruses, the ratio of frameshifting to readthrough varies from virus to virus; that of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is estimated to be approximately 5% (Opperman et al., 1977; Jacks and Varmus, 1985) , that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-l) is approximately 10% (Jacks et a/., 1988a; Wilson el al., 1988) .

It has been proposed that these structures probably cause a subset of ribosomes to pause or slow their scanning speed at the frameshift site, thus allowing ribosomes time to recognize the frameshift signal. This then results in frameshifting at the signal sequence. The signal sequence varies from virus to virus. However, for HIV-1 ribosomal frameshifting within the gag-pol overlap region does not appear to involve a downstream pseudoknot in juxtaposition to the signal and although another secondary structure of the mRNA is in juxtaposition, this sequence has been demonstrated to be dispensible. The HIV-1 frameshifting signal involves a sequence of six U residues (Wilson et al., 1988) .",

This FIV overlapping region of 109 nt contains a putative frameshift signal sequence of GGGAAAC very near its 5'end. This sequence is unlike that of HIV.

The results have localized the frameshift signal sequence and provide evidence to support the view that efficient frameshifting requires a downstream sequence that probably forms a pseudoknot structure and that its position relative to the frameshift site is important. The efficiency of frameshifting is apparently decreased when a potential palindromic secondary structure is inserted just upstream of the frameshift signal site.

For SD29 the gag-pal product was estimated to be ~2% of the gag product, for SD30 ~5% of the gag product. These results indicate that the tolerance for change in the spacer region is highly restricted. The observations are consistent with the reother mutants (SD24 and SD34) contain mutations in the distal stem. In (B) Western blots are presented of the mutant gag-partial protease gene products expressed from baculovirus vectors in insect cells.

However, little is known about the upstream structures required for frameshifting. In the immediate upstream region of the frameshift signal of FIV apparently there is no obvious sequence capable of forming secondary or tertiary structures which may affect the scanning speed of ribosomes. The possibility that this region forms secondary structures with distal regions of the mRNA is unknown. Reduction (pausing) of scanning speed of a ribosome may be required for an efficient frameshift event to occur. The question that is raised is whether reduction prior to the signal would affect the frameshift. To experimentally investigate the effect of upstream sequences which might conceivably slow the translational speed by forming secondary structures in the mRNA, palindromic sequences were inserted in the EcoRl site located just upstream of the frameshift signal. In mutant AcFIVGAG-1 B (Fig. 6A) , a 24-base palindromic sequence with the potential to form a 12-bp stem was introduced at this position (un-(underlined spaces) in the spacer region, while in SD30 the same triplet is duplicated (AAG).

In insect cells, the frameshift event within the gag-pal overlapping region of FIV occurred quite efficiently. The efficiency of this event in the authentic system (i.e., in FIV-infected mammalian cells) has not yet been estimated, so we cannot conclude if it occurs more efficiently in insect cells or not. The expression system may be useful for the screening of drugs that could inhibit the frameshift event. This remains to be investigated. In the insect expression system, the level of expression of a foreign gene can be very high (up to 50% of the total protein, see Matsuura et al., 1987) . The expression level of the FIV gag-partial protease genes is relatively high (>lO mg/lO' infected cells) which should facilitate the screening and analysis of antiviral agents inhibiting frameshifting.",

More recently, Brier-ley and associates (1989) analyzed the requirement of the downstream structure of IBV in detail and demonstrated that the more complicated tertiary pseudoknot structure is required for such an event to take place with high efficiency. They also concluded that such a structure should be positioned precisely with respect to the frameshift signal (Brierley et al., 1989) . In this study, the data we obtained by analyzing a series of mutants in this region support the view that the tertiary pseudoknot structure downstream of the frameshift signal in the mRNA of FIV is necessary for an efficient frameshift. The results are consistent with the analyses of RSVand IBV. However, the data do not unambiguously prove that the expression changes were due to structure as opposed to primary sequence changes. Alternative mutations, in particular those that restore the mutated stem structures with alternative sequences, are required to provide conclusive proof. In FIV, the spacer region between the frameshift signal and the proximal stem of the pseudoknot structure is 8 bases. This raises the question of what determines the optimal spacer length. Although the possibility of the involvement of other factors cannot be ruled out, it seems likely that the total configuration of the pseudoknot structure is involved, as indicated from the data obtained with the mutant AcFIVGAG-SD33. To understand this in more detail, more extensive analyses of mutants affecting the length of stems and/or of loops will also be required.",

From this it can be concluded that the carboxy-terminal region of the gag product within the gag-pal overlapping region is not important for the frameshift event. This observation also suggests that pausing by a subset of ribosomes during translation of FIV gag-pol m-RNA may occur precisely at the frameshift site, since once the A sites of ribosomes recognize the stop codon in the mutant AcFIVGAG-SD23, the ribosomes should be released from the m-RNA.

            "text": "Of particular interest from the present results is that like RSV and IBV, FIV requires the downstream pseudoknot structure for an efficient frameshifting. HIV-I, which has a gene structure similar to that of FIV, apparently does not have the potential to form a pseudoknot structure in juxtaposition to the frameshift signal (Wilson eta/., 1988) . It has been argued that this difference in the requirement for downstream structures could be related to the different evolution of these viruses (Jacks, 1990) . If so, HIV-1 -type frameshifting may have evolved quite recently since FIV is classified in the same genus as HIV-1 (i.e., lentiviruses). It has been also suggested that the HIV-l frameshift signal (a run of six U residues) is inately permissive for the frameshifting event without the need for any downstream structures (Wilson et a/., 1988) . However, the downstream region of the HIV-1 frameshift site has the potential to form a stem loop structure, although not a pseudoknot structure. In the case of HIV-2 and some SlVs such as SIV,,,, in which the frameshift signal is thought to be the same as that in HIV-l, their downstream regions have the potential to form pseudoknot structures. It will be interesting to investigate the structural requirements for frameshift events of SIV strains. Such an analysis will answer the question of whether some frameshift signals are inately permissive per se or if flanking sequences or structures are required.",

            "text": "Although we now have a large body of knowledge on the structural requirements for an efficient frameshift event in retroviruses and some coronaviruses in the downstream region of the frameshift site, little is known about the requirements in the upstream region. It appears that the native sequences do not form any secondary or tertiary structures upstream of the frameshift sites, although this cannot be formally excluded without knowledge of the complete tertiary structure of the mRNA. It is possible that the upstream region has no effect on the frameshift event. The results with the mutants AcFIVGAG-1 B and AcFIVGAG-1 S, in which different lengths of palindromic sequences were inserted just upstream of the frameshift site, indicate that the frameshift efficiency was lowered depending on the length of palindrome sequences inserted. It is possible that such palindromic sequences form stable secondary structures and decrease the ribosomal scanning speed. If this is true then some level of ribosomal scanning speed may be required for the proper frameshift event to occur at the appropriate site. This would be consistent with the observation that translational error is correlated with increased speed of translation (Thompson and Karim, 1982) . However, we cannot rule out the possibility that these artificial structures prevent the backward slippage of the ribosomes at the frameshift site. Further analyses are necessary to investigate this issue.",
