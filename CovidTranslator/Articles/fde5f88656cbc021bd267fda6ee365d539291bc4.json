            "text": "Influenza is a major health problem that poses a significant clinical and socioeconomic burden in all age groups [1] . In comparison to the general population, influenza may lead to more severe and life-threatening complications among hospitalized patients with underlying conditions [2] . It is a well-established fact that the health-care workers (HCWs) are at risk of occupational exposure, contraction of seasonal influenza and subsequent transmission to inpatients [3] . The most effective method of preventing these annual outbreaks and resulting morbidity and mortality is by influenza vaccination [4] [5] [6] . Vaccine has been reported to prevent influenza-related respiratory tract infection by 56% and overall mortality by 68% [5] . In addition, generalized influenza vaccination of HCWs has been demonstrated to positively impact on absenteeism rates and economic burden associated with seasonal epidemics [6] . In light of these evidences, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the US Public Health Service has suggested since 1981 vaccination for groups at risk of influenza-related complications, as well as for HCWs who care for patients susceptible to significant morbidity following influenza infection [7] . However, influenza vaccine acceptance by HCW has been consistently one of the lowest among groups for which immunization is recommended [8] [9] [10] [11] . The overall vaccination coverage in a previous survey performed at our institution over three consecutive campaigns ranged from 16% to 40%, far below the 60% established by the World Health Organization (WHO) for high-risk groups [9] . The reluctance of HCWs to accept influenza vaccination appears to be associated in the literature with lack of knowledge of influenza and its complications, lack of availability, or perception of low personal susceptibility, among others factors [10] . On 11 June 2009 , only 2 months after the first human infections with a new influenza A (H1N1) virus of swine origin were reported from Mexico and the USA, the WHO declared the first influenza pandemic of this century [12] . As a result of the strain's novelty, most people lack innate immunity against this agent. An early case report from Mexico reported that 12% of HCWs caring for influenza cases developed respiratory symptoms [13] , and nosocomial outbreaks of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza have been recently documented [14] . On 29 July 2009 the ACIP recommended the vaccination efforts focus on five key populations, including health-care and emergency medical services personnel [15] . To date, the majority of studies examining vaccination attitudes and compliance among HCWs have been centered on seasonal influenza [8] [9] [10] [11] 16] . In our knowledge, very few reports have specifically assessed the barriers to and facilitators of pandemic vaccine receipt in this population, and all of them were performed before the beginning of the current immunization campaign [17] [18] [19] . Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the actual vaccination rates as well as the conceptions and attitudes towards both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine among HCWs in a tertiary-care university hospital.",

The questionnaire was designed on the basis of existing literature [9] [10] [11] and consisted of 14 items grouped in six sections: (a) demographics (gender and age), professional category and patient contact; (b) history of seasonal influenza vaccination in the 2008-2009 immunization campaign; (c) history of both seasonal and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccination in the current 2009-2010 campaign; (d) being in a priority group for seasonal or pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccination due to medical conditions; (e) reasons for accepting or declining the seasonal influenza vaccination, selected from a structured repertoire with 6 and 8 possible answers, respectively; (f) and reasons for accepting or declining the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccination, also selected from a structured repertoire similar to that for seasonal influenza. Only one response was allowed for each of these last two items, including an open-ended question in which responders were asked to freely describe their personal reasons to accept or decline vaccination.",

Self-reported membership of a priority group for pandemic vaccination was associated with refusal (OR: 5.98; 95% CI: 1.35-26.5; P = 0.019). As shown in Fig. 1 , the most frequent reasons for accepting seasonal influenza vaccination were \"self-protection\" (51.9%), \"protection of the patient\" (23.7%), and \"being in a priority group for immunization\" (12.2%). Fig. 2 summarized the reasons adduced for refusal of seasonal influenza vaccination, with \"doubts about vaccine efficacy\" (20.8%), \"fear of adverse reactions\" (14.0%), and \"lack of concern\" (13.2%) as the most commonly reported. With regards to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccination, \"self-protection\" (33.3%), \"protection of the patient\" (31.0%) and \"protection of own family and colleagues\" (21.8%) were the most common reasons for acceptance (Fig. 1) , whereas the existence of \"doubts about vaccine efficacy\" (30.0%), \"fear of adverse reactions\" (16.6%), and \"lack of concern\" (9.1%) were the main reasons adduced for refusal of such a measure (Fig. 2) . In most of the cases, the main arguments either to accept or to refuse the pandemic influenza vaccine significantly differed to those reported for seasonal influenza. When specifically analyzed the reasons for refusal of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza immunization among the 190 HCWs (36% of all responders) that reported having received the seasonal influenza vaccine but not the pandemic, the presence of \"doubts about vaccine efficacy\" (38.1%), \"fear of adverse reactions\" (19.4%) and \"lack of concern\" (9.0%) again emerged as the ones most commonly adduced. Finally, among the 15 HCWs (2.8% of the total sample) vaccinated against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza but not against seasonal influenza, the most frequent reasons given for the refusal of the latter were \"lack of time availability\" (7 responders) and the \"perception of not being at risk for acquiring the disease\" (2 responders).",

In a study performed at 31 hospital departments in Hong Kong, Chor et al. evaluated the acceptability of pre-pandemic vaccination against both influenza A subtypes H5N1 and H1N1 among 2255 HCWs [18] . The survey was conducted during two different periods: January 2009 to March 2009, when the WHO pandemic alert level assigned to H5N1 influenza was phase 3, and May 2009, when the WHO pandemic influenza alert level for (H1N1) 2009 influenza reached phase 5. The authors found a consistently low overall willingness to accept vaccination against either H5N1 (28.4% for the first survey, increased to 34.8% in the second one) or H1N1 influenza (47.9%). The most common reasons cited for refusal of immunization were similar to those found in our study, and included \"worry about side effects\" and \"query on the efficacy of the vaccine\". No significant differences were found in the level of acceptance for pre-pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine along the two study periods, despite the escalation to WHO alert phase 5 [18] . Schwarzinger et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey among 1434 French general practitioners (GPs) between June 16 and September 22, 2009 [17] . Over 60% of respondents declared their willingness to accept the pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 vaccination as soon as it became available; GPs working part-time in long term care facilities, being on call for emergencies, and having the highest workload in practice were more likely to express their willingness to accept immunization. A history of seasonal influenza vaccination in the prior years emerged as the strongest predictive factor associated with acceptance [17] . Finally, a recent questionnaire survey on the attitude towards pandemic influenza vaccination of 441 HCWs at five Greek hospitals in November 2009 has showed a low acceptability rate (17%), which is in line with that of our study [19] .",

Various explanations could be considered. Among the most obvious is that such studies only documented the willingness to accept immunization, which may not necessarily reflect the actual behaviour of the surveyed worker or the extent of the \"emotional epidemiology\" regarding pandemic influenza vaccination, as it has been recently termed by Ofri [24] . Comparison of these results should also take into consideration the role of workplace cultures or local factors, such as the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, where 27% of cases were HCWs [25] . Finally, the discrepancy we observed could be consistent with other preliminary reports. Schwarzinger et al. pointed out that 1 month after the pandemic influenza vaccination campaign started in France, uptake rates remained below 10% among HCWs regardless of the positive attitudes reported by GPs surveyed in their study [17] . With regards to the general population, Lau et al. reported that 45% of participants in a cross-sectional survey in Hong Kong would be highly likely to take up pandemic influenza vaccine [26] , and 67% of responders in another study among adult Australians indicated their willingness to receive such a measure [27] . However, and despite these relatively high reported acceptance rates for pandemic vaccination, the actual coverage rates among the general adult population in France and the United States were as low as 7.9% and 20% by the end of January 2010, respectively [28, 29] .",

A higher professional category may be associated with a better knowledge about the indications and safety of vaccines, or could act as a surrogate for salary level, a variable that has been demonstrated to predict the acceptability of immunization [23] . On the opposite, nurses and nursing assistants have the lowest coverage rates for pandemic vaccination (3.9% and 8.1%, respectively), a finding that is consistent with previous experience on seasonal influenza [9, 16, 20] . In the present study, as well as in others [9, 10, 21] , a history of previous seasonal influenza vaccination has been identified as a strong predictor of receipt of immunization in the following year. However, this factor did not retain significance in our multivariate model for pandemic vaccination, which is clearly opposite to the survey by Schwarzinger et al. [17] . Regardless of the potential impact of variations in attitudes toward vaccination between different professional categories, these results suggest the role of specific barriers among HCWs that might have limited the acceptability in a global scenario of pandemic alert. In the bivariate analysis, a history of regular patient contact was related with a lower seasonal influenza vaccination coverage, with the difference not reaching statistical significance in the multivariate model. We hypothesized that this subgroup of HCWs may have developed some degree of \"emotional tolerance\" towards the disease. The massive application of additional measures (i.e., protective facial mask or hand washing) imposed during the current pandemic could have favoured the development of a subjective sense of protection against the risks associated with the seasonal influenza. Specific educational interventions should be aimed at reducing such a misperception.",

Perceived risk of contracting the infection was one of the factors showing the strongest association with intention to accept pandemic vaccination in the study by Chor et al. [18] . Although these results agree with those reported by previous studies focused on seasonal influenza [10, 11, 16] , we found statistically significant differences in the relative distribution of both arguments according to the type of immunization (Fig. 1 ). \"Self-protection\" was more frequently argued among HCWs that reported having received the seasonal influenza vaccine (51.9%) as compared to those that accepted pandemic influenza vaccination (33.3%); conversely, \"protection of the patient\" was cited as the main argument by 23.7% and 31.0% of responders who received seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine, respectively (P-value < 0.05 for both comparisons). Most educational programs for HCWs have focused on diminishing the risk of nosocomial influenza transmission to high-risk patients, and it may be assumed that this message has been strengthened in view of the initial uncertainty regarding the novel virus. Interestingly, those surveyed who received the pandemic vaccine were also more likely to argue the \"protection of own family and colleagues\" as the main reason for acceptance, despite the lack of a professional or contractual relationship between HCWs and their relatives.",

The random sampling was conducted initially, but subsequent selection by quotas may enter a potential selection bias of unknown magnitude or direction. Most of the questionnaires used for the analysis were obtained in the first two waves of the survey reflecting HCWs with similar attitudes. We exclusively relied on self-reports of immunization status or perceived membership in a high-risk group, and these data were not verified through medical or institutional records. Reporting may be subjected to workers' own knowledge or attitudes towards immunization programs. The survey design prevented us from indentifying any non-responder bias, although similar studies have failed to find relevant differences between responders and non-responders [35] . We did not evaluate the role of specific conditions in the perception of risk among HCWs falling into a priority group for immunization (i.e., chronic lung diseases, pregnancy or obesity). Among the strengths of our study is that it is the first to evaluate not only the anticipated willingness previous to the implementation of immunization schedules, but also the actual uptake of pandemic vaccine in a group of HCWs. The survey was performed very close to the end of the immunization campaign with the aim of minimizing the risk of recall-bias. Finally, our results are consistent in general with those previously focused on seasonal influenza vaccination, including those performed in our setting [9, 21] .",

The overall coverage of pandemic immunization among the HCWs in our institution (16.5%) was clearly susceptible of improvement. In our opinion, the findings presented herein could provide valuable implications for health policy decisions in anticipation of possible future pandemic waves, and support the need for continuous education efforts to reduce barriers and unfounded misconceptions in relation to pandemic influenza vaccination.",
