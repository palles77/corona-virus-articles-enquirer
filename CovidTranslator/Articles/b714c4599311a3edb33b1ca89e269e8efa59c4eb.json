Second, the CDHR3 risk allele was associated with increased numbers of moderate to severe RV-C-related respiratory illnesses in the first 3 years of life in both birth cohort studies, whereas no such association was observed for respiratory illnesses in which only non-RV-C viruses were detected. Third, a similar RV-C-specific association was seen during scheduled visits in COAST children.

CDHR3 is a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in respiratory epithelium. The rs6967330 G/A nucleotide variant results in a substitution (cysteine [Cys]/Tyr) at amino acid position 529 (Cys529Tyr). This amino acid position is located between two protein domains where the nonrisk (Cys) variant might interfere with disulfide bonds and potentially change protein structure (1). Transfection of the asthma and RV-C-associated risk allele, rs6967330-A (Tyr), resulted in increased surface expression of CDHR3 (1, 2) . Furthermore, protein modeling suggests an RV-C binding site in the three outer domains of CDHR3 (2) . The current evidence thus suggests that the CDHR3 protein has increased surface expression in children carrying the rs6967330-A (Tyr) allele, resulting in increased RV-C binding and, thereby, increased risk and severity of RV-C infections and of asthma exacerbations. Our findings might have important implications. From a clinical perspective, they raise the possibility of prevention or treatment of RV-C infections by targeting CDHR3. This might not only affect acute RV-C illnesses, but also the risk of asthma development (14) .",

Early RV infections are a risk factor for later asthma development and reduced lung function, but it remains unresolved as to what extent this association is causal (14, 16) . The current results, showing that CDHR3 variation is associated specifically with increased risk of RV-C infections, suggest that it can be used as an (unbiased) genetic \"tool\" to study potential long-term effects of early RV-C infections.
