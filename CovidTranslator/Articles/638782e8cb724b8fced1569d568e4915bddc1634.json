Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) uses this strategy to express its replicase component protein p88. In this study, we used a cell-free translation system to map cis-acting RNA elements required for \u2212 1 PRF. Our results show that a small stem-loop structure adjacent to the capindependent translation element in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of RCNMV RNA1 is required for \u2212 1 PRF. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggested that this stem-loop regulates \u2212 1 PRF via base-pairing with complementary sequences in a bulged stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site. The existence of RNA elements responsible for \u2212 1 PRF and the cap-independent translation of replicase proteins in the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 might be important for switching translation to replication and for regulating the ratio of p88 to p27.",

            "text": "Programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF) is a strategy to express a downstream ORF. In response to certain signals encoded in mRNA, a small percentage of ribosomes are induced to move back by one nucleotide and to continue translation in the new (\u22121) frame (Brierley, 1995; Giedroc and Cornish, 2009) . As a result, a stop codon in the first ORF is skipped, and a C-terminally extended protein is produced at a certain ratio. This mechanism is used by many viruses, including those in Retroviridae, Nidovirales, astroviruses, Totiviridae, and Luteoviridae, to produce viral replicase protein (Brierley, 1995) . Typically, \u22121 PRF requires two cis-acting RNA elements. The first element is a heptanucleotide sequence where the reading frame shifts. This sequence usually fits the consensus X XxY YYZ (the zero frame is indicated by a space; X is any identical base, Y is A or U, Z is not G, and lowercase indicates a consensus with some exceptions) (Dreher and Miller, 2006; Jacks et al., 1988) . A second element is an RNA secondary structure immediately downstream from the shifty site (Brierley et al., 1989; Brierley and Pennell, 2001) . This RNA structure is regarded as a physical barrier to stop translating ribosomes and to shift the reading frame (Namy et al., 2006) . A pseudoknot or a very stable RNA structure is usually proposed for the second element (Giedroc and Cornish, 2009 ). In addition to these RNA elements, Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) requires a third RNA element that is located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) (Paul et al., 2001) . This far-downstream element is thought to base-pair with a bulge-loop in a stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site, where it facilitates frameshifting (Barry and Miller, 2002) .",

            "text": "Our previous study showed that several capped RNA1 mutants with deletions in the 3\u2032 UTR supported the accumulation of negativestrand RNA2 less efficiently than did the wild-type (wt) RNA1 in BYL, although these RNA1 mutants produced p27 to similar or even higher levels than did wt RNA1 (Iwakawa et al., 2007) . This result suggests that the deleted regions are involved in the production of p88, which is translated via \u22121 PRF. To investigate whether the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 has the cis-acting RNA element(s) required for \u22121 PRF and the production of p88, we tested RNA1 mutants with a series of deletions in their 3\u2032 UTR (Figs. 1A and B, Iwakawa et al., 2007) for their ability to produce p88 in BYL. We used capped viral RNA transcripts because the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 contains RNA elements essential for cap-independent translation of both p88 and p27 (Iwakawa et al., 2007; Mizumoto et al., 2003) . Capped RNA1 mutants were incubated in BYL at 17\u00b0C for 4 h, and the accumulated levels of p27 and p88 were analyzed by western blotting using an anti-p27 antiserum. For this assay, we used the membrane fraction of BYL obtained after centrifugation at 20,000 \u00d7g for 10 min because the level of p88 accumulated in BYL was below the detectable threshold (data not shown). An RNA1 mutant (R1-SM) that has mutations in the heptanucleotide shifty site was used as a negative control. d3\u2032SLB, d3\u2032SLC, and d3\u2032SLDE-5\u2032 accumulated lower levels of p88 than those accumulated in wt RNA1, whereas all the RNA1s tested accumulated p27 to similar levels (Fig. 1C , lanes 3-5). d3\u2032SLF that lacks the 3\u2032 terminal SL required for negative-strand synthesis (Iwakawa et al., 2007) accumulated p88 as efficiently as wt RNA1 (Fig. 1C, lane 7) , suggesting that RNA replication, including negative-strand RNA synthesis and accumulations of dsRNAs, has no or little effects on the production of p88 via \u22121 PRF in BYL. These results suggest that the regions, including SLB, SLC, and SLDE, contain cis-acting RNA elements required for \u2212 1 PRF. To delimit the regions required for \u22121 PRF, we constructed RNA1 mutants with a series of deletions in the regions (Figs. 1A and D) and tested them as described above. Western blot analysis showed that the accumulated levels of p88 were much lower in RNA1 mutants with deletions in the stem of SLC than in wt RNA1 and in other RNA1 mutants despite their ability to accumulate p27 to a level similar to that in wt RNA1 (Fig. 1E , lanes 4 and 6). Deletions in SLB and SLDE affected the accumulation of p88 mildly (Fig. 1E , lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8). Interestingly, deletion of 3\u2032TE-DR1c did not affect the accumulation of p88 (Fig. 1E, lane 5) . This result suggests that the region of SLC, except for 3\u2032TE-DR1c, is involved in efficient \u2212 1 PRF.",

We hypothesized that SLCsSL stimulates \u22121 PRF via an interaction with the upstream signal. To address this issue, we examined the nucleotide sequences of the upstream cis-acting RNA element that is complementary to the loop sequence of SLCsSL. Five bases 897-GGGUA-901 in the bulge of the stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site (named here 5\u2032BulgeSL) can potentially base-pair to five bases 3562-UACCC-3566 in the loop sequence of SLCsSL (Fig. 5A) . These long-distance base-pairings are possible in all dianthoviruses, although the sequences in the 5\u2032BulgeSL (831-AAGGUA-836) and the SLCsSL (3507-UACCUU-3512) of CRSV slightly differ from those of other dianthoviruses (Fig. 5A, data not shown) . Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5A , the RNA secondary structures of both 5\u2032BulgeSL and SLCsSL are quite similar to those of a bulged stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site and a stem-loop predicted in the 3\u2032 UTR of BYDV genomic RNA (Barry and Miller, 2002) .

These RNA1 mutants were analyzed in both BYL and BY-2 protoplasts as described above. 5\u2032BulgeSL-m1 and 5\u2032BulgeSL-m2 have mutations in the bulge of 5\u2032BulgeSL, 3\u2032SLCsSL-mLoop and 3\u2032SLCsSL-mLoop2 have mutations in the loop sequence of SLCsSL, and Restore-1 and Restore-2 have mutations in both the 5\u2032 bulge and the 3\u2032 loop, which restore the potential base-pairings between them (Fig. 5B ). 5\u2032BulgeSL-m1 has the mutation in the central two bases that alters the amino acid sequence of p88, arginine to serine and valine to leucine at positions 259 and 260, respectively, but the mutation in 5\u2032BulgeSL-m2 does not alter it. All the RNA1 mutants with mutations that disrupt the 5\u2032-3\u2032 longdistance RNA-RNA interaction accumulated much less p88 in BYL (Fig. 5C, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6 ) and failed to support the efficient accumulation of viral genomic RNAs in BY-2 protoplasts (Fig. 5D, lanes  2, 3, 5, and 6 ). By contrast, RNA1 mutants with mutations that restored the 5\u2032-3\u2032 long-distance RNA-RNA interaction accumulated p88 as efficiently as did wt RNA1 in BYL (Fig. 5C, lanes 4 and 7) and supported the accumulation of viral genomic RNAs in BY-2 protoplasts (Fig. 5D, lanes 4 and 7) . It should be noted that, although the C to U mutation in 3\u2032SLCsSL-mLoop2 still allows non-Watoson-Crick base-pairing (G-U), this mutation greatly reduced the accumulated level of p88 (Fig. 5C, lane 6) .

Two cis-acting RNA elements, a heptanucleotide sequence and 5\u2032BulgeSL, are required for \u22121 PRF in RCNMV RNA1 Lommel, 1994, 1998; Xiong et al., 1993b) . In the predicted structure of 5\u2032BulgeSL ( Fig. 5A ; Kim and Lommel, 1998) , the five-nucleotide sequence (897-GGGUA-901) involved in the longdistance interaction can potentially base-pair to five bases 869-UAUCC-873 in the large loop sequence of the 5\u2032BulgeSL and could form an apical loop-internal loop interaction (Mazauric et al., 2008) . The putative pseudoknot played no role in \u22121 PRF in an assay using rabbit reticulocyte lysate and in infectivity assays using Nicotiana benthamiana (Kim and Lommel, 1998) , supporting the role of the five-nucleotide sequence in the bulge in a long-distance interaction. However, nucleotide substitutions in the bulge sequences in 5\u2032BulgeSL caused no deleterious effects on the accumulation of p88 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate or on the infectivity in N. benthamiana (Kim and Lommel, 1998) . These results contrast with our data showing that nucleotide substitutions in the same bulge sequences almost abolished the ability of RNA1 to accumulate p88 in BYL and to replicate and support RNA2 replication in BY-2 protoplasts (Figs. 5C and D). Such differences might arise from different assay systems and host plants. The requirement of RNA elements in the 3\u2032TE-DR1-mediated cap-independent translation of RCNMV RNA1 differs between host plants (Sarawaneeyaruk et al., 2009) . Alternatively, the six nucleotides changed in the previous research might produce other long-distance interactions to promote \u22121 PRF.",

            "text": "Long-distance RNA-RNA interactions regulate various steps in the viral life cycle. For example, BYDV and Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) require RNA-RNA base-pairings between the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 UTR to initiate translation (Fabian and White, 2004; Guo et al., 2001; Nicholson et al., 2010; Treder et al., 2008) . Bacteriophage Q\u03b2 and TBSV require a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction for RNA replication (Klovins et al., 1998; Panavas and Nagy, 2005) . Viruses such as Potato virus X, Flock house virus, and Coronavirus require long-distance basepairings for sgRNA transcription (Kim and Hemenway, 1999; Lindenbach et al., 2002; Moreno et al., 2008) . In the case of RCNMV, an intermolecular RNA-RNA interaction plays an essential role in sgRNA transcription (Sit et al., 1998) . In addition to these roles, a longdistance RNA-RNA interaction is required for \u2212 1 PRF in BYDV (Barry and Miller, 2002; Paul et al., 2001) and in RCNMV (Fig. 5) . In many viruses, RNA pseudoknot structures predicted to be adjacent to the heptanucleotide shifty site alone seem sufficient for \u22121 PRF (Giedroc and Cornish, 2009) . Such RNA pseudoknot structures are regarded as a physical barrier to stop translating ribosomes and facilitate \u2212 1 PRF (Namy et al., 2006) . It is unclear why the downstream complex stemloop structure (5\u2032BulgeSL) alone is not enough to facilitate \u22121 PRF in RCNMV RNA1 or in BYDV. Because the potential base-pairing between the bulge sequence and the large loop sequence within the 5\u2032BulgeSL, which could form an atypical pseudoknot, has no role in \u22121 PRF in Ratio of p88 to p27(%) Fig. 5 . A long-distance RNA-RNA interaction between 5\u2032BulgeSL and SLCsSL is essential for \u2212 1 PRF in RCNMV RNA1. (A) Predicted secondary structures of RCNMV RNA1 and BYDV genomic RNA showing the base-pairing interaction. Potential base-pairings in CRSV RNA1 is shown in the box. Dotted lines indicate potential base-pairings between 5\u2032 bulged stemloop and the stem-loop in the 3\u2032 UTR. Underlined italics indicate a shifty heptanucleotide sequence followed by the stop codon of p27 or ORF1, respectively. Numbers show nucleotide positions in RCNMV RNA1, CRSV RNA1, and BYDV genomic RNA, respectively. In RCNMV, letters labeled with asterisks in the apical loop of 5\u2032BulgeSL indicate the nucleotide sequences complementary to those in the bulge of 5\u2032BulgeSL (Kim and Lommel, 1998) RCNMV RNA1 (Kim and Lommel, 1998) , 5\u2032BulgeSL might not be strong enough to stall the translating ribosomes efficiently. Kissing RNA-RNA interactions between two stem-loops are more stable than a simple RNA helix of the same sequence (Weixlbaumer et al., 2004) . Taking this into account, the long-distance base-pairings between the stem-loop in the 3\u2032 UTR and the 5\u2032BulgeSL seem to be required to stabilize the 5\u2032BulgeSL to allow for the stalling of the elongating ribosomes over the shifty site to promote \u22121 PRF in RCNMV RNA1.",

A model for the switch from translation to replication has been reported in BYDV, in that the passage of RNA replicase on the 3\u2032 UTR of the viral genome disrupts the structures of the 3\u2032 RNA elements, which are needed for two sets of the long-distance base-pairing required for cap-independent translation and \u22121 PRF (Barry and Miller, 2002) .

The p88 bound in the 3\u2032 UTR might become a core for assembling the 480-kDa RNA replicase complexes with p27 and host proteins to initiate negative-strand RNA synthesis (Mine et al., 2010a, b) .

Structural rearrangement of RNA elements is reported in Turnip crinkle virus, in that the binding of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase to the 3\u2032 UTR of the viral genomic RNA induces a conformational shift of the RNA element required for efficient ribosome binding, causing a transient switch from translation to replication (Yuan et al., 2009) .",

These previous results suggest that p27 is associated mainly with translating RNA1 with polyribosomes because puromycin, a peptidyl acceptor antibiotic, causes polypeptide chain termination and induces the dissociation of polyribosomes from mRNA (Blobel and Sabatini, 1971; Lehninger et al., 1993) , and suggest that p27 does not bind to the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1. The lack of the association between p27 and the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 might allow translating RNA1 to continue to be a template for further translation for p27 until \u22121 PRF occurs by an unknown mechanism(s) that regulates the frequency of \u22121 PRF. Thus, the existence of RNA elements responsible for \u22121 PRF in the translation of p88 in the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 and the distinct binding properties between p27 and p88 might be important for regulating the ratio of p88 and p27.",

Briefly, capped RNA1 (1.5 \u03bcg) or its mutants were incubated in 25 \u03bcl BYL at 17\u00b0C for 4 h together with uncapped RNA2 (100 ng). After incubation, BYL was centrifuged at 20,000 \u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to obtain membrane fractions. The proteins from membrane fractions were analyzed by western blotting using an anti-p27 antiserum. The signals were detected with a luminescent image analyzer (LAS 1000 Plus), and the signal intensities were quantified with the Image Gauge program (Fuji Photo Film).",

Briefly, in vitro transcribed wt RNA1 (approximately 14 pmol) was treated by heating Fig. 6 . A model for regulation of translation and replication. (A) At the early replication step, an auxiliary replicase protein p27 is produced via 3\u2032TE-DR1-mediated cap-independent translation. p27 interacts with translating RNA1 except for its 3\u2032 UTR . The lack of the association of p27 with the 3\u2032 UTR containing 3\u2032TE-DR1 allows translating RNA1 to continue to be a template for p27. (B) Sufficient amounts of p27 on RNA1 allow 5\u2032BulgeSL to access SLCsSL by an unknown mechanism. (C) The interaction between 5'BulgeSL and SLCsSL facilitates the production of p88 via \u2212 1 PRF. (D) p88 binds to the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 through a translation-coupled manner by an unknown mechanism . The p88 binding or the formation the 480-kDa replicase complex in the 3\u2032 UTR of RNA1 disrupts RNA structures required for both cap-independent translation and \u2212 1 PRF. The conformational change of RNA structure causes a switch from translation to replication of RNA1. at 65\u00b0C for 2 min, 37\u00b0C for 10 min, and 25\u00b0C for 10 min in reaction buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.0], 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 ) with 3 \u03bcg of yeast RNA in 20 \u03bcl volume. One microliter of 0.1 U/\u03bcl RNase V1 (Ambion) or 0.1 ng/\u03bcl RNase A (Qiagen) was added to each of the pretreated RNAs and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 min. As a control, 1 \u03bcl of nuclease-free water was added to the pretreated RNA and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried by vacuum. The cleavage products were resuspended in 8 \u03bcl nuclease-free water. One microliter of each enzymatically treated RNA transcripts was mixed with 0.5 \u03bcl of 10 pmol/\u03bcl primer, incubated at 90\u00b0C for 1 min and then transferred to room temperature for 5 min. The extension reaction was carried out in a final volume of 9.5 \u03bcl that included reverse transcriptase (Superscript III, Invitrogen), a 1\u00d7 concentration of the buffer provided by the manufacturer, 0.05 mM each of dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 5 mM of DTT, 0.5 \u03bcl of 40 U/\u03bcl RNase inhibitor (TOYOBO), and 10 \u03bcCi [\u03b1-35 S] dATP. The reaction was incubated at 55\u00b0C for 5 min, and then 0.5 \u03bcl of each of the four dNTPs (10 mM) was added. The mixture was incubated at 55\u00b0C for an additional 20 min, and then the reaction was stopped by the addition of formamide loading dye. The extension products were separated in a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 8 M urea. Dideoxy sequencing reactions were prepared using Sequenase\u2122 Version 2.0 DNA sequencing Kit (USB), and the products were separated along with the primer extension products. ",
