            "text": "Kobuviruses are small non-enveloped RNA viruses that probably cause diarrhea in cattle and swine. Since its discovery in 2003, few studies have addressed bovine kobuvirus (BKoV; a species of Aichivirus B) infections. BKoV has been reported in Europe, Asia, and South America, suggesting a worldwide distribution. To investigate the presence of BKoV in Egypt, 36 fecal specimens from diarrheic calves in two different Egyptian provinces (Cairo and Sharkia) were screened by RT-PCR and 24 (66.7%) were found positive for BKoV. RNA from one of the positive samples (BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744) was subjected to next-generation sequencing to determine the complete BKoV genome sequence. When compared to the only recorded BKoV genome sequence (BKoV/U-1/AB084788), the studied strain showed 94 amino acid (aa) substitutions through its entire polyprotein (2463 aa), one nucleotide (nt) insertion and one nt deletion in the 2B gene and 4-nt deletions in the UTRs (2 each). Additionally, five VP1 and seven 3D sequences were obtained from other samples by using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. A discrepancy in the phylogenetic topography of VP1 and 3D was observed, where the Egyptian VP1 sequences were classified as a distinct cluster within the proposed lineage 1 (genotype A), which also contained strains from the UK, Brazil, and Japan. While, the 3D sequences from Cairo were related to those of Chinese strains unlike Sharkia ones that were more closer to Korean strains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection and genomic characterization of BKoV in Egypt or indeed Africa.",

Their genome consists of a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a large polyprotein [1] . After translation, the protein precursor is proteolytically processed into several structural and non-structural proteins. With a total size of 8.2-8.4 kb, the kobuvirus genome is organized sequentially as follows: VPg, 5\u2032UTR, leader protein (L), three structural proteins (VP0, VP3, and VP1), seven non-structural proteins (2A-2C and 3A-3D), 3\u2032UTR, and poly(A) tail [2] . The 3D gene encodes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). According to the function of the encoded proteins, the kobuvirus genome can be arranged into three distinct regions, namely P1 (encoding structural capsid proteins), P2, and P3 (encoding non-structural proteins) [3] .",

AiV B includes bovine, ovine, and ferret kobuviruses while AiV C includes only PKoV [4] . Kobuviruses have also been detected in black goats, rabbits, European roller, and bats (http://www.picor navir idae.com/). Based on VP1 sequence analysis, human AiV strains have been divided into three major lineages (1, 2, and 3) with nucleotide (nt) sequence identities < 84.8%. These three lineages were later renamed as genotypes A, B, and C [5] . Recently, Chang et al.

Furthermore, a deduced aa analysis of 101 BKoV-VP1 sequences revealed that the study strain had six residue substitutions. All study strains had an aa substitution of A 258 to S 258 .

Using generic kobuvirus primers, 24 of 36 (66.7%) diarrheic fecal samples tested positive for BKoV. These results are somewhat different from those reported in prior surveys. For example, kobuvirus was detected in 16.7% of healthy cattle in Japan [10] , 8.3% of diarrheic cattle in Thailand [17] , and 18.2% of diarrheic cattle in Brazil [18, 19] . In other countries, the prevalence has been described as follows: 6.25% in Hungary [12] , 1% in Belgium [20] , 25.8 -34.6% in Korea [21, 22] , 77.8% in the Netherlands [23] , 4.9% in Italy [11] , and 34.9% in China [6] . The highest rates of BKoV have been observed in Egypt (66.7% in this study) and the Netherlands (77.8) possibly due to the smaller sample size tested in these two studies (n = 36 and n = 9, respectively).

The VP1 gene was highly divergent while the 3D gene was highly conserved (Fig. 1 ). The study strain had one nt insertion (G4718) and one nt deletion (C4726) in the 2B region and Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of this insertion/deletion in BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744 as well as in four other study strains. The insertion-deletion resulted in three successive aa substitutions (L1304A, R1305S, and T1306H). Variant PKoV strains frequently express deletions in their 2B genes. The significance of these mutations is not yet known. It has been assumed that the 2B protein has multiple functions in different picornaviruses [24] . However, the 2B gene may not be responsible for kobuvirus pathogenesis [25] . The phylogenetic analysis of sequences representing partial 3D regions showed that BKoV strains from Cairo grouped with Chinese strains while those from Sharkia clustered with Korean strains. The Cairo strains shared identities of 97.8-99.9% at the nt level and 99.1-100% at the aa level while the two Sharkia strains shared identities of 99.9% and 100% at the nt and aa levels, respectively. Similarly, Chang et al. [6] and Candido et al. [19] stated that BKoV-3D sequences from the same epizootic areas grouped together and shared higher identities. Earlier studies have concentrated mostly on detection and sequencing of a smaller part of the BKoV-3D (RdRp) gene [21, 18, 19, 23] . The 3D genes are usually conserved. Thus, they are mainly used, phylogenetically, to discriminate BKoV from other kobuviruses but not to differentiate BKoV into distinct lineages [6, 26] .",

            "text": "On the other hand, VP1 is the most exterior, immunedeterminant capsid protein in BKoV and is used for serotyping as it carries several neutralization domains [1, 27, 28] . Molecular typing of the VP1 gene correlated with serotype specificity as strains from the same serotype tend to be monophyletic. This information is valuable in assigning taxonomic groups [29] . Until now, the observed evolutionary variations among different BKoV-VP1 strains have been studied based only on sequencing of 17 BKoV-VP1 gene sequences of Chinese origin. Four lineages (genotypes) were proposed based on phylogenetics and nt sequence identities (with an 85.1% cutoff value) [6] . BKoV VP1 sequences from Egypt belonged to lineage 1 (Genotype A), which includes BKoVs from Brazil, Japan (only U-1 strain), and Scotland. The members of genotype A shared nt identities higher than 85.1%, validating the genotyping of Chang et al. [6] . Other genotypes (B, C, and D) contained BKoV-VP1 strains from China only, so it appears that genotype A is the most prevalent cluster worldwide. Also, it was noticed that some strains from Scotland (SC13, n = 14) formed a new group (tentatively named genotype E/ lineage 5) within the phylogenetic tree ( Fig. S2) with nt identities less than 85.1% (74.6-78% with genotype A, 75.7-77% with genotype B, 74.6-75.3% with group C, and 77.8-78.3% with genotype D), indicating the presence of other genotypes that have not yet been acknowledged. It was noticed that BKoV-3D sequences from this study showed different phylogenetic topography than that of VP1 sequences, suggesting different evolutionary histories for the structural and non-structural regions. Due to the limited number of BKoV-VP1 sequences in GenBank, the present study provides important data for future genotyping and classification of BKoV.",

Between BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744 and BKoV/U-1/ AB084788, twelve aa substitutions were observed within the VP1 protein (Table S1 ). Adaptive mutations may play an important role in inducing diarrheal outbreaks through the generation of new variants that may not be recognized by host immune defenses. Moreover, they may participate in the escape of kobuviruses from the gastrointestinal tract to the circulatory system [30] . The discrepancy in the phylogenetic topography of VP1 (Fig. 3) and 3D (Fig. 2) between the Cairo and Sharkia strains is likely due to differences in evolutionary pressure and substitution rates between structural (VP1) and non-structural regions (3D). However, recombination events in non-structural genes, including the 3D gene, cannot be ruled out as it is common for all picornavirus to recombine in such regions [31] . Whole genome sequencing and the continued surveillance of BKoV diversity are required to increase information about this virus in Egypt and to document genetic shift caused by recombination events.",
