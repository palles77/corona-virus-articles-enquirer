            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2003. The SARS-CoV viral genome encodes several proteins which have no homology to proteins in any other coronaviruses, and a number of these proteins have been implicated in viral cytopathies. One such protein is 3a, which is also known as X1, ORF3 and U274. 3a expression is detected in both SARS-CoV infected cultured cells and patients. Among the different functions identified, 3a is a capable of inducing apoptosis. We previously showed that caspase pathways are involved in 3a-induced apoptosis. In this study, we attempted to find out protein domains on 3a that are essential for its pro-apoptotic function. Protein sequence analysis reveals that 3a possesses three major protein signatures, the cysteine-rich, Yxx and diacidic domains. We showed that 3a proteins carrying respective mutations in these protein domains exhibit reduced pro-apoptotic activities, indicating the importance of these domains on 3a's pro-apoptotic function. It was previously reported that 3a possesses potassium ion channel activity. We further demonstrated that the blockade of 3a's potassium channel activity abolished caspase-dependent apoptosis. This report provides the first evidence that ion channel activity of 3a is required for its proapoptotic function. As ion channel activity has been reported to regulate apoptosis in different pathologic conditions, finding ways to modulate the ion channel activity may offer a new direction toward the inhibition of apoptosis triggered by SARS-CoV.",

The 3a protein shows cytoplasmic (Oostra et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2004b; Yu et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2005a; Zhong et al., 2006) and plasma membrane (Ito et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2004b) localization in both transfected and viral-infected cells. 3a possesses three transmembrane regions (a.a. 34-56; 77-99; 103-125) in its N-terminus, and an intracellular C-terminal region (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The central region of 3a carries several conserved sequences which includes a cysteine-rich domain (a.a. 127-133), a Yxx domain (a.a. 160-163) and a diacidic domain (a.a. 171-173), which is then followed by the C-terminal domain (a.a. 209-264) (Oostra et al., 2006; Marra et al., 2003; Zeng et al., 2004; Tan et al., 2004b; Yu et al., 2004) . The cysteine-rich domain is known to be responsible for homo-and hetero-dimerization of 3a, which is crucial for its ion channel activity (Lu et al., 2006) . To date, the functional significance of 3a's ion channel activity on its function is still not well defined. The Yxx domain is a protein internalization signal which is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Sorkin, 2004) ; while the diacidic domain is a trafficking signal responsible for efficient endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein export (Nishimura and Balch, 1997) . Both the Yxx and diacidic domains play important roles in intracellular protein trafficking of 3a, and a deletion mutant (a.a. 160-173) which uncovers these domains abolishes the localization of 3a to the cell surface (Tan et al., 2004b) . Further, the 3a C-terminal domain (a.a. has been demonstrated to possess RNA-binding activity (Sharma et al., 2007) .",

In the present study, we performed a structure-function study of 3a with an aim to investigate the roles of these domains in its pro-apoptotic function in vitro and in vivo. In addition the cysteine-rich domain had previously been shown to be critical for 3a's ion channel activity (Lu et al., 2006) , our data further illustrate that the ion channel activity is indispensible for caspase-dependent apoptosis of 3a.",

Consistent with previous findings , we showed that up to 60% of 3a-WT-expressing Vero E6 cells displayed nuclear condensation ( Fig. 2A) . To determine the roles of CS, YA and DE motifs in 3a-induced apoptosis, we generated a 3a-CS-YA-DE triple mutant and examined its ability to induce nuclear condensation. When compared with 3a-WT, we observed a \u223c5-fold reduction of the number of condensed nuclei in cell population expressing the 3a-CS-YA-DE triple mutant protein (Fig. 2B) . Unlike 3a-CS-YA-DE triple mutant, cells expressing single mutant proteins (3a-CS, 3a-DE and 3a-YA) displayed more prominent nuclear condensation (Fig. 2C ). This indicates that CS, YA and DE motifs in 3a each contribute independently and significantly to apoptosis induction.",

We have previously demonstrated a role of caspase-8 in 3a-induced apoptosis . Here, we found that both caspase-8-and -9-specific inhibitors significantly suppressed nuclear condensation induced by 3a-WT in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2C ). This indicates 3a triggers apoptosis through both the death receptor-and mitochondria-mediated pathways. When we treated 3a-WT-expressing Vero E6 cells with a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Van Noorden, 2001) which blocks caspase-dependent apoptosis in general, a similar level of inhibition was again observed (Fig. 2D) . Consistent with the caspase inhibition results, we further showed that the activities of caspase-8 and -9 were significantly reduced in all 3a mutantexpressing cells (Fig. 2E and F) . Truncation of Bid and mitochondrial cytochrome c release are hallmark features of death receptor-and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways, respectively (Strasser et al., 2009 ). Here, we show that 3a-WT protein induced Bid cleavage (Fig. 3A) and mitochondrial cytochrome c release (Fig. 3B ). Taken together, our data demonstrate that the disruption of the CS, YA or DE motif individually does not diminish the ability of 3a to activate the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (Fig. 3) , which is indicative of functional redundancy of these motifs on 3a-induced apoptosis.",

As ion channel activity has been implicated in apoptosis (Burg et al., 2006) , we investigated whether disrupting the ion channel property of 3a would affect its pro-apoptotic function. To intervene the ion channel function we treated 3a-WT-transfected Vero E6 cells with ion channel blockers, 4-aminopyridine (AP) or Ba, and found that both inhibitors were able to suppress 3a-WT-induced nuclear condensation (Fig. 6F ). It has previously been shown that the C133S point mutation (Lu et al., 2006 ) compromised 3a's ion channel activity. As expected, both AP and Ba treatment exerted no further suppressive effect on 3a-CS-induced nuclear condensation (Fig. 6F) . We next fed 3a-WT flies with Ba and determined the extent of 3a-induced apoptosis by AO staining in vivo. We found that the number of AOpositive cells was largely reduced in 3a-WT-expressing larvae that were treated with Ba (Fig. 7C ) when compared to the untreated control (Fig. 7B) . As Ba is an inhibitor of the 3a ion channel conductance (Lu et al., 2006; Fig. 6) , both our in vitro and in vivo data clearly demonstrate a linkage between the pro-apoptotic property and ion channel activity of 3a.",

            "text": "We previously showed that the SARS-CoV 3a protein induces caspase-dependent apoptosis both in vitro and in vitro Law et al., 2005) . Various structural/functional domains have been identified in 3a, which include the cysteine-rich, Yxx and diacidic domains ( Fig. 1A ; Tan et al., 2006) . The cysteine-rich domain is crucial for homo-/hetero-dimerization and ion channel activity of 3a (Lu et al., 2006) ; while both the Yxx and diacidic domains are well-characterized protein intracellular trafficking signals (Nishimura and Balch, 1997; Sorkin, 2004) . Although the properties of these protein domains have been well characterized, their roles in 3a's pro-apoptotic function had not been studied. Although these three domains are located in close proximity, it is possible that each of them is independently responsible for eliciting 3a's cellular activities, such as apoptosis induction. In this study, we generated mutant 3a constructs, 3a-CS, 3a-YA and 3a-DE (Fig. 1A) , and investigated the functional significance of the cysteine-rich, Yxx and diacidic domains on 3a's pro-apoptotic activity. We previously demonstrated that 3a-WT induces nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation in Vero E6 cells; 3a-expressing cells are also found to be TUNEL-positive . Here, we used nuclear condensation as readout to measure the pro-apoptotic potential of 3a mutants. We found that all 3a-CS, 3a-YA and 3a-DE mutant protein-expressing cells possessed reduced caspase activities, and these proteins were also less potent in inducing cell death (Fig. 2) . Consistent with the in vitro data, all the 3a mutants displayed diminished pro-apoptotic activities in vivo. We observed elevated number of apoptotic cells in flies overexpressed with 3a-WT ( Fig. 5B ; Wong et al., 2005) , whereas the number of apoptotic cells was much reduced in mutant 3a-expressing flies (Fig. 5C-E) . Altogether, our data clearly show that all cysteine-rich, Yxx and diacidic domains are required for 3a's pro-apoptotic function.",

As the cytochrome c-mediated apoptotic pathway links tightly with caspase-9 activation, in this study we confirmed the involvement of caspase-9 in 3a-WT-induced cell death (Fig. 2) . Indeed, the involvement of caspase-9 in 3a-induced apoptosis has also been reported in a recent study performed by Padhan et al. (2008) . Both our and others' data indicate that 3a-WT utilizes more than one caspase pathway to trigger cell death. We further showed that both Bid truncation and mitochondrial cytochrome c release are involved in 3a-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3) .",

Barium chloride (Ba; Lu et al., 2006; Nietsch et al., 2000) and 4-aminopyridine (AP; Grishin et al., 2005) are two commonly used potassium channel blockers. We found that both Ba-and AP-treatment were able to rescue 3a-WT-induced nuclear condensation (Fig. 6) , and a similar suppressive effect was also observed in vivo (Fig. 7) . Besides, we further found that the ion channel activity of 3a is linked to caspase-dependent apoptosis. When we co-treated 3a-WT-expressing cells simultaneously with ion channel blocker and broad-range caspase inhibitor, no further inhibition of nuclear condensation was observed (Fig. 8) . This indicates that the ion channel activity and caspase-induced nuclear condensa- Fig. 8 . Pro-apoptotic and ion channel activities of 3a are linked. Vero E6 cells, either untransfected or transfected with 3a-WT construct, were treated with general caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) and/or Ba. z-VAD-fmk and/or barium chloride (Ba) treatment alone only induced minimal nuclear condensation on untransfected cells. Cells transfected with 3a-WT construct displayed nuclear condensation. z-VAD-fmk and/or Ba treatment significantly reduced nuclear condensation induced by 3a-WT expression in Vero E6 cells. Untransfected Vero E6 cells treated with 1 M staurosporine (STS) for 8 h were used as control, only z-VAD-fmk but not Ba was able to suppress STS-induced nuclear condensation. All results were plotted as percentage of cells that showed nuclear condensation, and were expressed as means + S.E.M. of three independent experiments. At least 100 cells were counted in each experiment. *p < 0.05, Ba and/or caspase inhibitor-treated 3a-WT-expressing cells versus 3a-WT control.",
