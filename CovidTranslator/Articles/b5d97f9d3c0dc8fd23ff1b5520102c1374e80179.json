However, little work has been done to determine the optimal level of investment in contact tracing. In this paper, we present a methodology for evaluating the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing. We develop and apply a simulation model of contact tracing and the spread of an infectious disease among a network of individuals in order to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of different levels of contact tracing. We show that contact tracing is likely to have diminishing returns to scale in investment: incremental investments in contact tracing yield diminishing reductions in disease prevalence. In conjunction with a costeffectiveness threshold, we then determine the optimal amount that should be invested in contact tracing. We first assume that the only incremental disease control is contact tracing. We then extend the analysis to consider the optimal allocation of a budget between contact tracing and screening for exogenous infection, and between contact tracing and screening for endogenous infection. We discuss how a simulation model of this type, appropriately tailored, could be used as a policy tool for determining the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing for a specific disease in a specific population. We present an example application to contact tracing for chlamydia control.",

            "text": "Studies of infectious disease control efforts-such as screening, vaccination, and contact tracing (also known as partner notification)-often focus on evaluating the effectiveness of such programs. For example, Saretok and Brouwers [1] evaluated the likely epidemic impact of school closures in the event of a potential pandemic influenza outbreak; Bozzette et al. [2] evaluated the effectiveness of different vaccination strategies in mitigating the effects of a smallpox outbreak; and Hethcote [3] evaluated the impact on gonorrhea prevalence of six different control measures. Some analyses of infectious disease control efforts have focused on finding the most effective means of allocating a fixed amount of epidemic control resources across competing interventions and populations, and/or over time. For example, Zaric and Brandeau [4] determined the optimal allocation of a fixed budget among HIV prevention programs at a given point in time and over time [5] ; Longini et al. [6] determined the optimal distribution of a limited supply of vaccine in the event of an influenza pandemic; and Halloran et al. [7] performed a similar analysis in the event of a smallpox outbreak. Other analyses have evaluated the minimum cost means of achieving a desired level of epidemic control. For example, M\u00fcller [8] determined the cost-minimizing pattern of vaccination among different age groups to achieve a desired epidemic reproduction number, and Revelle et al. [9] determined the cost-minimizing use of treatment, prophylaxis, and BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) vaccination to achieve a target prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in a given time horizon.",

That work was based on a simple compartmental model (an SI model) with homogeneous mixing, and employed a highly stylized representation of the contact tracing process (with contact tracing yielding new identified disease cases at a constant rate, as a function of disease prevalence). A number of studies have shown that analyses based on more realistic models of disease transmission in social networks can yield significantly different projections of disease spread than projections generated by simple compartmental models [21, 32] . In addition, depending on how it is implemented (e.g., how many contacts of any index case are traced; which contacts are tracedand possibly removed-first; and other factors), a fixed level of contact tracing may yield different numbers of new index cases identified, as well as differing impact on the spread of the disease. Therefore, we use simulation to evaluate the effectiveness (and cost) of different levels of contact tracing-and thus to determine the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing.",

Using the simulation results in conjunction with a cost-effectiveness threshold, we show how to determine the optimal level of investment in contact tracing. We extend the analysis in Section 4 to consider the optimal allocation of a budget between contact tracing and disease screening. We consider the cases of screening for exogenous infection (infected individuals entering the population) and endogenous infection (infected individuals already in the population).

To measure the steady state for a particular case, we performed 1,600 runs. For each run, we generated a random smallworld graph and infected a single random node. Then we simulated the network for five years in one-day time increments (1,825 days in total), taking the daily average prevalence (per capita frequency of states I and IT) starting with day 181. (Visual inspection of sample runs indicated that the system is in steady state by this time.) We averaged over all the runs and set our error bars to the 95% confidence intervals. Table 1 shows the values of all parameters we used in our simulations. These parameters are roughly consistent with the transmission and control of gonorrhea. The speed of disease transmission, t 1 , is consistent with unprotected sexual contact every 45 days, and a 50% chance of transmission per unprotected sexual contact [41] . Choosing a 30-day average duration between infection and treatment (t 3 ) is consistent with all women and 50% of men being asymptomatic, symptoms otherwise appearing after 4 days, and then a 3-day delay in obtaining treatment [41, 42] . Gonorrhea is treated with one dose of antibiotics which costs approximately $50 [43] . We estimated that individuals would refrain from risky behavior for an average of 3 months after treatment.

In a typical cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative interventions, the analyst evaluates the total costs and health benefits-usually measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) experienced-for each intervention. The analyst then identifies the non-dominated interventions (a dominated intervention is one that costs more and yields fewer QALYs than another single intervention or than a linear combination of two interventions). The undominated interventions can then be ranked in order of increasing cost to create an efficient frontier of interventions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as the incremental cost per QALY gained, increases as one moves along the efficient frontier. The \"best\" intervention is the one that has the highest possible incremental costeffectiveness ratio without exceeding a pre-determined cost-effectiveness threshold \u03b1. We will suppose in our analyses that a value for the cost-effectiveness threshold \u03b1 is known. This value is often determined as an implicit value given by accepted public health/medical practice [46] . In our model, the \"alternative interventions\" involve alternative levels of investment in contact tracing (or in contact tracing and screening). Because our simulation analyses focus on the steady-state disease prevalence achieved by a given level of contact tracing, we express all costs and health benefits in annual terms. Thus, the cost of each \"alternative intervention\" equals the annual cost of contact tracing (CK) plus the annual cost to treat cases of the disease. The effectiveness is measured in terms of the resulting steady-state prevalence, or equivalently as the total steady-state number of QALYs experienced in the population per year. Thus, for these analyses, the cost-effectiveness threshold \u03b1 represents the maximum amount we are willing to pay per year for one more steady-state QALY. We used the value \u03b1 = $50,000, a value commonly used in cost-effectiveness analyses of health-related interventions [46] .",

The points correspond to capacity K ranging from 0 to 10, as in (a). At the optimal budget this curve has a slope of 1/\u03b1 (the slope of the gray line). Here \u03b1 = $50,000/QALY tracing capacity, the corresponding reduction in steadystate prevalence diminishes. This makes intuitive sense because as the contact tracing capacity increases and prevalence decreases, we trace more contacts, fewer of whom will be infected. Thus, the probability that the contacts we trace are infected decreases as the contact tracing capacity increases. Our simulation model allows us to quantify this decrease-and thus to evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of different amounts of contact tracing. Figure 3b , which is based on the same simulations as Fig. 3a , shows the total annual cost associated with each level of contact tracing (K ranging from 0 to 10), and the total annual (steady-state) QALYs experienced in the population (recall that the population size n = 500 is constant). The costs incurred include not only the capacity costs of contact tracing (C = $6,000 for each unit of capacity K) but also the costs of treating the disease (c = $50 per case treated). While the contact tracing capacity is the biggest annual expense, disease treatment costs cannot be neglected. Indeed, as contact tracing capacity (K) increases, treatment cost decreases because the prevalence of the disease decreases. Our simulation model allows us to quantify these costs and savings.",

Thus, we set the average degree of the scale-free network to 2.4 so that the steady-state disease prevalence in the absence of contact tracing would be the same as that for the small-world network with no contact tracing. The degree of 2.4 is less than the value 5 used in the smallworld network because, with a scale-free network, the disease spreads more efficiently: the scale-free network has a few individuals with many more contacts than average, and these allow for relatively efficient disease transmission. Figure 5 shows steady-state annual QALYs experienced for different levels of contact tracing for the small-world network (the same curve as in Fig. 3b ) and for the scale-free network. In both cases, contact tracing has diminishing returns to scale (i.e., the curves are concave). For non-zero levels of contact tracing, disease prevalence is slightly lower in the scale-free network than in the small-world network. This is expected because the scale-free network has some individuals who are highly connected, and finding them (through contact tracing) has a large payoff. For this example, the optimal annual investment is approximately $1,000 more for the case of the scale-free network than for the case of the small-world network.

We see that for capacity K total > 5, using a mix of screening and contact tracing achieves lower disease prevalence than does contact tracing alone, and the difference increases as the total capacity increases. Figure 6c shows the total cost of each strategy, including treatment costs (for different levels of K total and different allocations of K total between contact tracing and screening), and the resulting annual steady-state QALYs experienced. The points arranged (more or less) vertically represent different allocations of a given total capacity between screening and contact tracing. The efficient frontier in Fig. 6c connects the best strategy for each total capacity level. The optimal strategy is given by the point on the curve where the tangent line has a slope of 1/\u03b1. At this point, the annual cost is $25,500 with approximately 499.1 steady-state QALYs experienced per year. This point corresponds to a capacity K total of 3, all of which is allocated to contact tracing (thus, three contacts traced at any one time), with annual disease treatment costs of approximately $7,500.

An increase in the endogenous screening rate increases the number of individuals in the population who are screened per unit time, and could correspond to an increase in the rate at which health care providers offer screening to patients.

[54] found that clients at STD clinics who were found to be infected with chlamydia reported an average of 1.7 contacts. Hence we set the probability that a contact is reported to 1.7/3 = 57%. We estimated the cost of treating one case of chlamydia as c = $50 + 0.3($500) = $200: in 70% of cases, an inexpensive ($50) course of antibiotics is sufficient to treat the infection, but in roughly 30% of the cases, patients develop acute pelvic inflammatory disease which must be treated at an additional cost of Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals (1,600 runs). a Simulated steady-state disease prevalence as a function of contact tracing capacity, K, for the case of chlamydia. b Steady-state annual cost and QALYs experienced as a function of contact tracing capacity.

For all other parameters of the model (t 3 , t 4 , t 5 , \u03b7 1 , \u03b7 2 , and C) we used the same values as shown in Table 1 . Figure 8a shows the effect of different contact tracing capacity levels (K = 0 to 15) on steady-state chlamydia prevalence in the population. In the absence of any contact tracing, steady-state disease prevalence is 8%. As contact tracing capacity increases, prevalence decreases, but with diminishing returns, as expected. For K = 5, steady-state prevalence is 4%; for K = 10, steady-state prevalence is approximately 2.7%; for K = 15, steady-state prevalence is 2.3%. Figure 8b shows annual costs and QALYs experienced for each level of contact tracing. For a costeffectiveness threshold of \u03b1 = $50,000/QALY gained, the optimal contact tracing capacity is K = 11. The annual cost is approximately $92,000, corresponding to $66,000 for contact tracing plus $26,000 for treatment. The resulting endemic level of disease prevalence is approximately 2.6% (Fig. 8a ). If the public health budget for this example constrains contact tracing to fewer than 11 individuals being traced simultaneously, Fig. 8b shows that significant health benefits can still be achieved by contact tracing. For example, a contact tracing capacity of K = 6 will still reduce steady-state prevalence from 8 to 3.7%. A simulation model such as ours allows one to quantify the tradeoffs associated with different levels of contact tracing.",

This framework combines concepts from cost-effectiveness analysis with simulation of a disease and the effects of contact tracing among a network of individuals. Our simulation results suggest that contact tracing is likely to have diminishing returns to scale: incremental increases in the budget for contact tracing yield diminishing decreases in the disease prevalence. This makes intuitive sense: the larger the number of contacts traced per unit time, the less likely it is that the incremental contacts traced will be infected, and thus the smaller the number of new cases that will be identified and removed. Use of a cost-effectiveness framework, combined with the simulation results, allows one to determine the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing. We also showed how, when other interventions such as screening are available, simulation can be used to determine the best mix of interventions for any given capacity level, and then cost-effectiveness principles can be applied to determine the appropriate total capacity for screening and contact tracing.",

            "text": "One useful avenue for future research is to extend our simulation model to capture more details of contact tracing and disease transmission and progression. For example, our current model stylizes the screening of infections from exogenous sources. A more realistic model could break out the various sources of exogenous infection (e.g., holiday travelers, visitors from certain countries, legal immigrants, and illegal immigrants) and the opportunities to screen them (e.g., when they request a visa or at clinics in immigrant neighborhoods). As another example, our model of contact tracing does not include the genotype information available to investigators that allows them to distinguish between new and continuing outbreaks. In practice, when a new outbreak of a disease is detected, the intensity of contact tracing is often increased until a significant level of epidemic control has been achieved. Thus, a natural extension of our work is to consider the case of dynamically changing levels of contact tracing. A more sophisticated model would show additional benefits of contact tracing not captured by our model. As contact tracing capacity increases, the average time from acquisition of infection to detection and treatment decreases. Our model captures this effect (Fig. 9) . However, our model does not capture the fact that Contact tracing capacity Days until treatment Fig. 9 Average time from acquisition of infection until treatment is initiated, as a function of contact tracing capacity, K. Vertical bars represent 95% confidence intervals (1,600 runs) the most severe symptoms and complications are in patients whose disease was untreated the longest. Extending our model to include multiple infected states (for example, states representing benign versus acute symptoms), which differ in their infectiousness, quality multipliers, and treatment costs, would model this phenomenon and thus help quantify this additional benefit of contact tracing.",
