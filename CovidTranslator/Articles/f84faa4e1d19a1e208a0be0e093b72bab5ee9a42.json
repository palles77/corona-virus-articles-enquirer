Accordingly, in an effort to provide guidance to scientists interested in generating purified recombinant proteins, representatives from our research groups collaborated to articulate our 'consensus' advice (Box 1), along with a brief rationale for each choice. In essence, we tried to answer the question \"what would you try first?\", understanding that several choices are often possible or even desirable. We also provide guidance for those cases in which the initial attempt fails or problems are encountered, in other words, \"What next?\".

There are other methods that are perhaps equivalent, but space limitations preclude an in-depth discussion of all possible cloning, expression and purification strategies.

Among the most comprehensive and best annotated is the Mammalian Gene Collection, which maintains a repository of >19,000 human cDNAs, covering ~65% of all annotated genes. For genes or splice variants not easily obtained through more traditional routes, total gene synthesis can be used. Over the past few years, the cost of gene synthesis has dropped almost fivefold, and it will undoubtedly continue to decrease. One advantage of gene synthesis is the ability to change the codon bias of the gene to be more compatible with the recombinant host. However, for Escherichia coli, expression strains supplemented with additional tRNAs can often overcome the codon bias of the recombinant gene17. For example, in a study of 30 human genes by the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), there was no clear advantage in the use of codon-optimized genes compared with the natural sequence expressed in tRNA-supplemented strains (N.A. Burgess-Brown, S. Sharma, F. Sobott, C. Loenarz, U. Oppermann and O. Gileadi; submitted).",

In expressing a protein domain, the choice of the N-and C-terminal boundaries represents an important consideration because even small differences can dramatically influence both solubility and expression. For example, Klock and colleagues18 evaluated a nested set of 2,143 N-and C-terminal truncations from 96 targets and found considerable variation in both solubility and aggregation behavior by altering the protein length by just a few amino acids.",

Thus, pragmatism dictates testing many truncated forms of the protein to select one or more for scale-up production. For proteins of known or readily predicted three-dimensional structure, the borders should be engineered to encompass the domain of interest. As an example, ten constructs of the targeted domain might be made at the outset of every project, one corresponding to the full-length protein and nine representing the clones derived from amplifying a combination of three different 5\u2032-end primers and three different 3\u2032-end primers. Gr\u00e4slund and colleagues have compared the success rate of the nested-primer approach with the predicted success rate if one had chosen only a single 'optimal' construct.

The optimal step size between the nested primers is not yet fully understood; we commonly make constructs to encode proteins that vary in length by 2-10 amino acids at each end19. For proteins without a predictable threedimensional structure, the approximate boundaries of the region of interest might be identified using functional assays and scanning deletion mutagenesis, and then optimal boundaries for expression can be identified using nested sets of PCR primers, as above23. Boundaries of structured domains can also be determined experimentally by using limited proteolysis combined with mass spectrometry analysis24.

The unique feature of these methods is the ability to transfer the cloned sequence among a series of compatible vectors that can be used to express the gene in different hosts or with different tags. For bacterial expression, however, the probability of identifying a clone that expresses a soluble protein is increased by making different variants of a single protein in the same E. coli host rather than by cloning a single variant into vectors with different tags and expression hosts19 , 29.",

Despite the lack of a clear winner based on success rate, most of our research groups selected an N-terminal hexahistidine tag that can be removed by a site-specific protease, such as the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease36.

First, an N-terminal tag ensures that the bacterial transcription and translation machineries always encounter 5\u2032 and N-terminal sequences that are compatible with robust RNA synthesis and protein expression, respectively. Second, oligohistidine-tagged proteins can be purified using a relatively simple protocol using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)37. Third, histidine tags rarely affect the characteristics of the protein, which distinguishes it, for example, from glutathione S-transferase (GST), which itself is a dimer that then imposes dimerization on the recombinant protein. Fourth, the hexahistidine tag is relatively small and usually does not dramatically alter the solubility properties of the target protein. By contrast, larger tags, such as the maltose-binding protein (MBP), can often increase the apparent solubility of the recombinant moiety, even when the protein is either insoluble by nature, or unstable or unfolded and, therefore, less likely to be active38 -40. Fifth, for the specific application of protein crystallography, short histidine tags appear to be neutral actors; in most of our projects, we routinely attempt crystallization and NMR structure determination with both cleaved and uncleaved proteins, and their relative representation among the resulting three-dimensional structures is roughly equivalent. A recent PDB-wide survey41 also indicates that hexahistidine tags do not have a consistent impact on the N-terminal structure of the target protein.",

Under repressive conditions, T7 RNA polymerase is not produced, and transcription of the target gene is negligible. After induction, when the T7 RNA polymerase is produced, most of the cellular protein synthesis machinery will be devoted to producing the target protein. On occasion, low-level expression of T7 polymerase within these strains leads to expression of the recombinant protein and may slow or prevent growth of the transformed bacteria. The expression of such highly toxic proteins can be effected by using T7 lysozyme-expressing strains42, strains in which the T7 RNA polymerase is under the control of the arabinose promoter43, by producing the protein in a cell-free system44 or by driving expression of the recombinant protein directly by the more tightly regulated arabinose promoter system45.",

Therefore, whereas positive small-scale experiments are often predictive of the results from large-scale growth, there will inevitably be a substantial proportion of false negatives in which an apparently nonexpressed or insoluble protein can be in fact, expressed in soluble form when grown on a larger scale.

The lysis buffer should contain a strong buffer (50-100 mM phosphate or HEPES) to overcome the contribution of the bacterial lysate, high ionic strength (equivalent to 300-500 mM NaCl) to enhance protein solubility and stability, protease inhibitors and a reducing agent such as Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) to prevent oxidation of the protein.

Indeed, a substantial fraction of proteins precipitate if the salt concentration is reduced to physiological levels, particularly as the protein becomes more pure and concentrated. The choice of NaCl as the salt is mainly historical and, although not systematically explored, there is no reason to believe that sodium and chloride are optimal. Indeed, sodium and chloride levels in the cell are very low and are probably never the physiologically relevant counter-ions for intracellular proteins. A modest amount of imidazole (see resin manufacturer's recommendations) should be included in the cell extraction buffer to reduce binding of less histidine-rich proteins to the IMAC column.

The affinity resin has limited capacity, so loading near-saturating amounts of the recombinant protein on a column improves purity. Tag cleavage followed by affinity purification is also effective in removing contaminants, as these proteins are unaffected by the protease and bind to the column after reapplication of the cleavage reaction. Samples copurifying with chaperones should be regarded with suspicion because this indicates that the protein may have some unfolded character. In cases where the target protein cannot be separated from the chaperones by additional chromatography, use an alternative expression system, process a different construct of the protein or try working with a closely related ortholog.",

In either case, the problem worsens as the protein concentration increases. There are no generic solutions but some potential solutions, which must be explored for each protein, are to: find a more stabilizing buffer through screening using analytical gel filtration or thermal denaturation (see Supplementary Methods), maintain the protein at lower concentration (<0.1-0.5 mg/ml), maintain an adequate reduced state to prevent protein oxidation (>5 mM DTT, refreshed as required), maintain the salt concentration at high levels (ionic strength >500 mM of a monovalent salt), add glycerol to 10%, add arginine in the range of 50-500 mM, add a mild nondenaturing detergent (0.1% \u03b2-octylglucoside) or keep the protein at its optimal temperature (determined empirically).",

If the aim is to study the function of the target protein, and the fusion protein is an acceptable reagent, then it may be an appropriate strategy. However, this approach has its caveats. In the absence of a robust and quantitative functional assay, one reasonably uses solubility as a proxy for function. However, proteins that are soluble only with a larger tag can be 'dragged' into solution by the tag, and revert to an insoluble form if the fusion partner is removed38 -40.This indicates that the integrity of the recombinant protein as a fusion protein may be suspect. For example, wildtype GFP is mostly insoluble when expressed in E. coli at 37 \u00b0C but is largely expressed in the soluble fraction as an MBP fusion58. Nonetheless, bacterial colonies expressing the MBP-GFP fusions display only weak fluorescence, suggesting that the GFP is nonfunctional (G.S. Waldo; unpublished data). Accordingly, before any functional studies, considerable attention should be paid to whether a target protein appears to be soluble only because it is a passenger on a larger tag.",
