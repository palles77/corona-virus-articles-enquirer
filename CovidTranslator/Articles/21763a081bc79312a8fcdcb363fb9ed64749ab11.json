Just as knowing the positions and roles of players is essential to understanding a football or basketball game, knowing the complete roster of relevant genes and proteins, and the roles that they play, is essential to understanding viral pathogenesis.

The cellular processes that are hijacked vary with the stage of infection, and conversely, viral infection induces a cohort of cellular genes that help the cell fend off the infecting virus. Viruses frequently mutate to adapt to the environment or to improve infection efficiency. In contrast, host proteins mutate at a much slower rate, if at all, and therapeutically targeting host proteins that are important for viral replication may be more successful at thwarting viral escape. A variety of high-throughput screens have therefore been developed to identify host proteins that are important for viral replication (Panda and Cherry, 2012) .",

This method makes use of the cellular RNAi pathway, which naturally produces regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to specifically silence target genes. In the RNAi pathway, noncoding RNAs are processed into shorter stemloop structures called pre-miRNA, which are then further cleaved into 20-22 base-pair siRNAs. One strand of the double-stranded siRNA, termed the guide strand, is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex for targeting to the corresponding mRNA. siRNAs and miRNAs are both processed through this pathway and bind to target mRNA through an eight-nucleotide seed region, but with different end results. siRNAs bind to their target mRNA and induce degradation of the transcript. In contrast, miRNAs bind to their target mRNA and inhibit translation without leading to transcript degradation, in part due to their ability to bind to transcripts without perfect complementarity. The RNAi pathway can be experimentally induced through the introduction of synthetic siRNAs or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in a transient or stable manner. Algorithms and mathematical models have been developed to design and predict targeting efficiency on the basis of sequence characteristics, such as GC content and whether hairpin structures form within the siRNA.",

This method uses a cDNA library to transcribe each gene; the long dsRNA is then digested by bacterial RNase III. The resulting esiRNAs effectively knock down target gene expression. All genetargeting strategies using RNAi have their limitations, and as whole-genome screens are more widely used, reproducibility, consistency between assays, and offtarget activities remain a concern (Jackson and Linsley, 2010).",

CRISPR was originally discovered in bacteria, where it provides immunity against bacterial viruses by disrupting viral transcription (Barrangou et al., 2007) . Genome-editing strategies using CRISPR take advantage of bacterial Cas9, an enzyme that catalyzes double-stranded DNA breaks, to specifically target and create deletions in the exons of a desired gene. CRISPR functions through the base pairing of a guide RNA (gRNA) to a specified genomic location. The gRNA directs Cas9 to the target sequence where it induces a double-strand break, leading to a sequence deletion or insertion. Unlike siRNA and shRNA, which can result in an incomplete knockdown of the target gene, CRISPR permanently edits the genome and can result in the complete knockout of a gene. CRISPR has been used to achieve individual gene knockdown on a genome-wide scale by stably expressing Cas9 in mouse embryonic stem cells or in HeLa cells (Koike-Yusa et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014) . A genome-wide library of pooled gRNAs is then generated and gRNAs are individually expressed using lentiviral vectors. There are few false positives, and the phenotype is stronger than that observed when the same genes are knocked down with a shRNA.",

The Z prime cannot exceed 1, which indicates a perfect assay, and a good separation between negative and positive controls yields a Z prime between 0.5 and 1. Different methods of determining hits may account for some of the variability seen in screens that have been run using similar parameters. Loss-of-function assays can be run as whole-genomic or targeted subgenomic screens, and siRNAs or shRNAs can be delivered in gene-based pooled or in arrayed formats. In pooled libraries, two to four siRNAs for the same gene are delivered simultaneously, which increases the likelihood of achieving significant gene knockdown. However, if one of the siRNAs is toxic to the cell, then that gene will be eliminated from the screen regardless of the effects of the other siRNAs. Following screening using a pooled library, the pools need to be deconvoluted through confirmation of phenotype and knockdown using each siRNA individually.",

A luciferase reporter can be incorporated into the virus, such that is it activated when the virus replicates. Lower values will be reported if the virus fails to enter the cell or if it is unable to subsequently propagate. This method was used in a screen to identify host factors involved in influenza virus replication (Konig et al., 2010) . The influenza virus used had the viral HA gene replaced with a Renilla luciferase gene, which allowed luciferase activity to be measured following infection. Almost 295 genes were identified as being important for early replication steps, including those involved in endosomal processes, intracellular trafficking, and ubiquitination. Another method to measure viral replication is through tracking the expression of a viral protein, or by replacing a viral protein with a tagged or fluorescent protein, such as green fluorescent protein. After infection, the cells can then be stained for the endogenous or tagged protein, and the amount of virus in each cell can be measured through highcontent imaging, which uses robotics to image proteins or process cells through fluorescent microscopy. This method was also used to identify host factors required for influenza virus replication (Brass et al., 2009) . Cells were transfected with siRNA pools, and after influenza virus infection, the cells were immunostained for the presence of HA, which was used as a surrogate for viral replication (Figure 2 ). Nearly 150 host antiviral genes were identified as potential targets after validation assays. This loss-of-function screen identified an important family of host restriction factors, call the IFITM (interferon-inducible transmembrane) proteins, which potently inhibit the replication of influenza virus, West Nile virus, and Dengue virus. IFITM3 was later confirmed as a broad-acting restriction factor through a gain-of-function screen using a curated list of ISGs (Schoggins et al., 2011) .",

These pathways converge on NF-\u03baB, IRF3, and IFN-\u03b2 transcription, and binding sites for these transcription factors can be attached to a luciferase reporter gene so that activation of the signaling pathway can be quantified.

The sequencing of samples from nine different time points after infection revealed many novel viral transcripts, including antisense transcripts, spliced transcripts, and transcripts that overlapped multiple annotated genes.

A major advantage of co-purification approaches is that they identify many proteins contained within a complex, making the process of identifying complexes and pathways associated with a protein of interest a much simpler task than with two-hybrid or protein microarray approaches (which rely on bioinformatics approaches and public databases to identify complexes and prioritize interactions). Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry, termed AP-MS, has been used to characterize a wide range of biological systems, including virus-host interactions. Although many biological systems are amenable to AP-MS analysis, the use of affinity-tagged proteins introduces an inherently synthetic aspect to the assay. The most common method of introducing a tagged protein into a cell is by transfection, a method that does not work well for many types of primary cells. Furthermore, AP-MS requires a fairly large amount of starting material, which is not scalable for many cell types and primary cell systems, and AP-MS screens do not identify direct, physical interactions. Entire complexes are co-purified such that the specific interactions between members of a complex may be obscured. Cross-linking approaches combined with AP-MS can overcome this problem by providing distance constraints between proteins within a complex. Cross-linking AP-MS approaches are still highly specialized, particularly with respect to the bioinformatics interpretation of the spectra of cross-linked peptides.",

For this approach, all the genes associated with the HIV genome, as well as unprocessed polyproteins, were cloned into a vector that contained a dual affinity tag fused at the C-terminal end of the proteins (J\u00e4ger et al., 2011) . Each clone was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells and was also used to generate stably expressed, tetracycline-inducible versions in Jurkat cells. HIV-human protein complexes were purified by affinity purification and the resulting complexes were analyzed by mass spectrometry. An unsupervised scoring system was then used to identify host-pathogen protein-protein interactions and to separate nonspecific from specific interactions. Using this score, a high-confidence interaction map was generated and overlaid with human-human protein interactions and HIVhuman genomics data (Figure 3 ).

Yellow nodes correspond to viral proteins and all other nodes represent human factors (red indicates the interaction was identified in Jurkat cells and blue indicates the interaction was identified in HEK293 cells). Blue edges between nodes correspond to the HIV-human protein interactions that were identified whereas black edges represent connection between human proteins derived from several protein-protein interaction databases.

This integration can be performed through side-by-side analysis of multiple loss-of-function screens, or it can be done by integrating orthogonal datasets. Protein-protein interaction studies provide clear evidence of which individual proteins interact with each other. Network representations then allow host-pathogen interactions to be visualized. Protein-protein interaction data can also be applied to genetic screens to better understand the functional significance of each gene (Shapira et al., 2009 ). However, individual gene arrays make it more difficult to determine genetic interactions, or how the absence of two or more genes will affect the virus-host interactome. Genetic interactions can further reveal whether two genes function independently or in conjunction with each other. For example, if knocking down two genes independently results in reduced viral replication, there is no easy way to determine whether it is because both genes are in the same pathway or because the genes are in pathways that act in parallel. If both genes are knocked down at the same time, and the reduction in viral replication is additive, then it is likely that these genes are in independent signaling pathways. If viral replication is reduced to a similar level as either gene alone, then the genes are likely in the same pathway. Predictions can be made based on protein-protein interactions, but designing studies that systematically test combinations of genes is the most effective method to determine the genetic and functional relationships between these target genes.",

Close interactions between virologists and biostatisticians are necessary to develop proper analysis tools. The quest to elucidate the virus-host interactome has already benefited greatly from open-source databases. For example, Gene Ontology (GO) is a bioinformatics database that allows researchers to categorize their gene lists into functional groups, and GO data can be complemented with commercial (e.g., Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) or open-source (e.g., Cytoscape) network analysis programs. These programs are used to visualize clusters of activities and provide an idea about how the genes are interrelated. Using screening data, GO, and known protein interactions, a predicted interaction network can be generated. Importantly, the cumulative results from genome-wide screens provide a valuable resource for the field and are being used to create a clearer picture of virus-host interactions.",

Although a truly comprehensive determination of every such factor is currently beyond reach, a variety of experimental approaches are being used to work toward this goal. Gene-based approaches include loss-of-function screening using siRNAs or shRNAs, and screens of this type have identified hundreds of human host factors required for influenza virus replication. Newer CRISPR-based approaches, which provide improved targeting and stable and complete gene knockouts, are also being developed for use in high-throughput screens. Gain-of-function screens complement these approaches by providing the ability to identify host antiviral genes that may be down-regulated by the infecting virus. RNA-seq, which can identify and quantify entire viral and cellular transcriptomes, is yielding new views into the complexity of transcription and the incredible diversity of coding and noncoding RNA transcripts. Many RNAs that no one had ever before thought to look for are likely to have roles in the virus-host interactome.",

Viruses also impact host metabolic processes and interact with host metabolites. In addition, players beyond the virus and host-the components of the host microbiome-contribute to infection outcome.

HA, which is an influenza-encoded protein that can be used as a surrogate measure of viral replication levels, is quantified using imaging technologies after RNAi treatments. Inhibition of viral replication after gene depletion reveals host factors that are required by the virus for replication. Prior stimulation with interferon enables an understanding of the virus-host interaction in cells that are in a preexisting antiviral state. The heat map reflects potential effects of knockdown of individual genes on the replication levels of wild-type influenza virus; influenza virus with a deletion in the NS1 gene; or wild-type influenza in cells pretreated with IFN-\u03b2.",
