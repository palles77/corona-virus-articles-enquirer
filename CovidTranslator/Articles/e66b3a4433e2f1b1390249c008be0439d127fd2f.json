In the present study, an alphavirusbased replicon particle vaccine platform, which has demonstrated robust immunogenicity in animal models, was tested for effects of antivector immunity on immunogenicity against hemagglutinin of influenza virus as a target antigen and efficacy for protection against lethal challenge with the virus. Chimeric alphavirus-based replicon particles, comprising Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus nonstructural and Sindbis virus structural components, induced efficient protective antibody responses, which were not adversely influenced after multiple immunizations with the same vector expressing various antigens.",

Alphaviruses are among the viral vectors being developed and undergoing clinical testing due in part to their ability to stimulate humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses. Alphaviruses belong to the Togaviridae family and contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 12 kb encoding four nonstructural proteins in the 5= twothirds of the genome, followed by a strong subgenomic promoter that directs expression of the viral structural proteins in the 3= one-third of the genome. Upon infection of a cell, the alphavirus nonstructural proteins are immediately translated to form a polymerase complex, which initiates replication of the viral genome and high-level transcription from the subgenomic promoter and translation of the downstream structural protein gene products, which leads to assembly of progeny viral particles.",

These alphavirus vectors have a modified RNA genome where the subgenomic coding region for the structural proteins has been replaced with one or more antigen encoding sequences. This modification allows for cytoplasmic replication of the RNA vector but renders defective de novo viral particle formation because of the lack of the structural proteins. Such alphavirus vectors are referred to as \"replicons.\" The replicons can be used in the form of DNA, such as plasmid DNA vaccines (13) , or alternatively with the \"defective\" replicon RNA packaged into virus-like particles with the alphavirus capsid and envelope structural proteins. Such particles (replicon particles) can be produced by providing structural proteins to replicon RNA in cultured production cells (7, 27, 39) . The replicon particles have been shown to be highly efficient for eliciting antigen-specific immune responses in a variety of animal models (3, 17, 18, 22, 31, 35, 36) .",

Indeed, it has been shown that vaccines using vaccinia virus vector failed to induce strong immune responses in the presence of antivector immunity (28, 46) . In the case of adenovirus vectors, interference by preexisting antivector neutralizing antibodies has been vigorously discussed (4, 8, 15, 24, 30 ) although a few controversial findings have been reported (2) . For VEE-based replicon particles, it has been shown that anti-VEE antibodies induced by the particles did not interfere with the induction of protective immunity induced by replicon particles based on the same vector, expressing a different gene of interest (41) , although the neutralization titers against the vector were not shown in the report. More recently, the alphavirus-based vaccine strategy has been tested in clinical settings (6, 33) . One of these studies reported that immunization with VEE-based replicon particles could successfully break tolerance to self-antigen (a tumor-specific antigen) despite induction of vector-specific neutralizing antibodies.",

To obtain the sequences encoding HA from the influenza strains, viral seeds were processed for RNA extraction using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany). The extracted RNA was subsequently reverse transcribed, followed by PCR using primers of sequences at the 5= and 3= end of the HA coding region. For RESVIR17, the parental A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) was used to design PCR primers. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To avoid selecting sequences containing mutations incorporated during PCR, a consensus sequence of each HA segment was determined from multiple clones. The sequence identical to the consensus sequence from the RESVIR17 (H3N2) strain was further transferred to the VCR-Chim2.1 vector (16, 38) . The replicon particles derived from the HA sequence of RESVIR17 (H3N2) were referred to as VEE/SIN-H3. Similarly, the HA and nucleoprotein (NP) sequences from the A/WS/33 (H1N1) were transferred to the VCR-chim2.1 vector, and the replicon particles produced from these constructs were referred to as VEE/SIN-H1 and VEE/SIN-NP, respectively. cDNA encoding severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)spike protein (GenBank accession number Y310120) was also subcloned into the VCR-chim2.1 vector to prepare replicon particles expressing SARS-spike protein (VEE/SIN-SSP). The HN gene of the PIV3 JS strain (48) or the gp140\u232cV2 derived from the HIV-1 SF162 strain was generated synthetically and also inserted into the VCR-chim2.1 alphavirus replicon vector to produce VEE/SIN-PIV3 and VEE/SIN-gp140 replicon particles, respectively (38, 39) .

In order to induce antivector immunity prior to immunization with VEE/SIN-H1, we subcloned the sequence encoding the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), as an antigen unrelated to HA, into the chimeric vector and prepared replicon particles expressing SARS-spike protein (VEE/SIN-SSP). The hyperimmunization induces immune responses to various components of replicon particles, including VEE virus nonstructural proteins, while only anti-envelope (SIN) antibodies are expected to neutralize cellular entry of the replicon particles. Upon replicon particle immunization, the SIN envelope glycoproteins were supplied as molecules associated with the particles and not synthesized de novo in infected tissues in vivo. Although the adjuvant effect could be expected from the RNA replication event upon particle infection, the amount of the administered envelope glycoproteins of the replicon particles as antigens was much lower than that found with standard protein immunization. For this reason, we vaccinated mice i.m. with these replicon particles repeatedly (three times, at weeks 0, 3, and 6) with a high dose, i.e., 10 7 IU/mouse, which was the highest feasible producible dose at our laboratory. After the hyperimmunization, the mice were vaccinated once or twice at 3-week intervals with 10 4 IU/mouse of VEE/SIN-H1 particles. We observed that mice vaccinated with the VEE/SIN-SSP particles were as protected as animals in the control groups that had been vaccinated with PBS (Fig. 2) . Moreover, the possibility that antivector immunity might cross-protect against influenza virus infection may be excluded, as mice vaccinated with VEE/SIN-NP replicon particles were susceptible to influenza virus lethal challenge (data not shown).",

Due to a lack of reagents to study immunogenicity against the HA protein from the influenza A/WS/33(H1N1) strain, we repeated the above-described experiment with the influenza RESVIR17 (H3N2) strain. We vaccinated mice i.m. with VEE/SIN-SSP replicon particles with the dose of 10 7 IU/mouse four times (weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9). We detected high titers of anti-SARS-spike antibodies in the immunized animals, indicating that the vaccination had been successful (Fig. 3A) . The mice were subsequently vaccinated i.m. with 10 4 IU of VEE/SIN-H3, particles prepared with the HA sequence from RESVIR17 (H3N2). HA-specific antibody titers of the sera from these animals were used to evaluate the suppressive effect of the prior hyperimmunization. Interestingly, the animals vaccinated with the VEE/SIN-SSP yielded immune responses specific for the H3 protein that were as high as those of the animals from the control group, which were vaccinated with PBS (Fig. 3B ). Since RESVIR17 (H3N2) does not infect mice, we measured hem-agglutination inhibition (HI) titers to evaluate production of functional antibodies instead of performing challenge experiments. Although before immunization with VEE/SIN-H3 particles, some mice (i.e., one hyperimmunized and all control mice showing HI titers of 40) showed marginal HI activity in serum, hyperimmunized mice developed significant serum HI activity similar to those detected in sera of PBS control mice after VEE/ SIN-H3 particle immunization ( Table 1 ). The vector neutralization titers varied from 138 to 20,421. However, there was no correlation between the alphavirus neutralization titer and the HAspecific ELISA titer.",

One possible explanation for the unaffected humoral responses in the hyperimmunized mice was that the immunization with VEE/SIN-SSP failed to mount neutralizing antibodies in vivo to the SIN virus envelope protein, which the chimeric replicon particles utilize for infection. To address this possibility, we analyzed the sera for neutralizing titers against infection with chimeric replicon particles in vitro. Surprisingly, all animals possessed a sufficient number of neutralizing antibodies to prevent infection of replicon particles in vitro (Table 1) . These data indicate that preexisting antivector immunity does not interfere with protective immune responses after immunization using the same alphavirus replicon vector.",

            "text": "There are a number of publications evaluating alphavirus-based replicon particle-based vaccines for immunogenicity as well as protective efficacy against a variety of infectious agents, including human immunodeficiency virus (11, 12, 19, 20, 50, 52, 54, 55) , cytomegalovirus (42, 43) , respiratory syncytial virus (9, 14, 31) , measles virus (35, 36) , parainfluenza virus (17, 18) , and influenza virus (1, 22, 41) . Furthermore, the VEE/SIN replicon particles have demonstrated higher cellular immune responses over SIN virus-based replicon particles using the gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus (38) . The chimeric replicon particles used in the present study were also able to show improved humoral responses compared to SIN virus replicon particles (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) and successfully demonstrated protective immune responses in different preclinical studies (5, 17, 18, 35) . The VEE/SIN replicon particles have two major advantageous characteristics. First, the chimeric replicon particle expresses the replicase from VEE virus, which is known to be less sensitive to type 1 interferon (IFN) (38) , thus enabling it to replicate more efficiently than the SIN virus-based replicon particle. This mechanism most likely leads to larger amounts of protein expression of the gene of interest. Consequently, the chimeric rep- a Serum neutralization titers were determined at 90% inhibition of infection of BHK cells. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (10) , which is known to give values correlating with protection, was used to evaluate protection in serum immunized with antigens derived from virus that cannot infect the animal. The hyperimmunized group was treated four times with 10 7 IU of VEE/SIN-SSP replicon particles. In the control group, mice were treated with PBS before immunization with VEE/SIN-H3. licon particles offer stronger antigen presentation to the host immune system. Second, the envelope proteins of the chimeric replicon particles are derived from those of SIN virus with a point mutation to more efficiently infect dendritic cells (DCs) (16) . Therefore, the use of the chimeric replicon particles also adds an advantage to the immunogenicity, since DCs are pivotal professional antigen-presenting cells. When the replicon RNA starts to replicate in the host cell, it forms double-stranded RNA intermediates, which are the ligand of toll-like receptor (TLR) 3. The signaling through the TLR leads to production of interleukin 12, which is an upstream cytokine leading to IFN secretion in turn leading to Th1 and subsequently to cytotoxic T cell responses (23, 26, 34) . The scenario of immune activation by replicon particles is thus more natural for the immune system, by mimicking viral infection, but without causing actual disease. Although the high potency of alphavirus replicon particles is advantageous to induce better protective immunity, such robust immune responses might induce antivector immunity that would reduce vaccine efficacy when administered repeatedly. The present study addressed this issue. To set up challenge and immunization conditions we selected a high lethal challenge dose (300 mLD 50 /mouse) of influenza virus and determined an immunization dose to ensure the detection of decreased efficacy due to antivector immunity. We observed that vaccinations with relatively small doses of replicon particles are enough to protect against the lethal challenge with a relatively excessive dose of A/WS/33 influenza virus (Fig. 1 ). The protective replicon particle doses depend on the challenge dose (data not shown); therefore, it is possible to further reduce immunization doses if mice are challenged with lower virus doses. The virus was administered i.n. without anesthesia, in order to target and infect the upper respiratory tract. The replicon particles were also protective when mice were challenged with anesthesia to infect the lower respiratory tract (data not shown).",

For example, a significant proportion of the human population already has antibodies against a number of adenovirus serotypes (37) . The broad seroprevalence of the human population may limit application of the vector. In the case of alphaviruses, the viruses are not commonly infecting the human population and most individuals are negative for anti-alphavirus immunity. Furthermore, the present study using HA of influenza virus as a vaccine antigen showed that repetitive immunization of the chimeric replicon particles induced antivector immunity, whereas efficacy of the vaccine was not affected (Fig. 2) . Although contaminated HA protein was not detected in the replicon particle preparation used for the immunization, it is still possible to argue that a trace amount of protein incorporated in the particles might be sufficient to induce immune responses. However, in the absence of adjuvant, the subunit vaccine preparation cannot yield specific anti-HA IgG responses as high as those of replicon particle-based immunization (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Moreover, VEE/SIN-H3 that had been accidentally stored on dry ice for 2 days and had lost their infectivity were immunized to mice but failed to induce specific humoral immune responses to HA (data not shown). These data and observation further suggest that the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the VEE/SIN vector (SIN envelope) did not affect the induction of antibodies against HA encoded in the replicon particles.",

Rhesus macaques could also be boosted to increase immune responses by multiple administrations of replicon particles, although the effects of antivector immunity were not directly addressed (54) . Thus, the alphavirus replicon particles may be applicable to humans for multiple administrations without decreasing efficacies. This characteristic is of particular advantage for some pathogens, such as influenza viruses, which very often change their antigenicity (antigenic drift); anti-influenza vaccines must be prepared according to the prediction of an outbreak every year. Moreover, the alphavirus replicon particle platform is suitable for preparing vaccines against influenza pandemics; it handles only a part of the genetic material from aggressive influenza strains, similar to the revolutionary reverse genetics (RG) approach (21) . While the RG is used with live viruses (although they are supposed to be attenuated) to isolate subunit proteins, there is no step of producing infectious influenza virus in the replicon platform. This approach, therefore, grants further safety for preparing the vaccines. Virus-like particles (VLPs) constitute another potential vaccine platform (29, 40, 44) . The technology is similar in safety to the replicon platform, as no influenza virus is produced, although production of VLPs requires more genes from influenza virus (HA, NA, and M1).",

We cannot directly exclude the possibility of carryover of receptor molecules from production cell lines during the particle preparation. However, we did not detect anti-bovine serum antigen (BSA) antibodies from particle-immunized mouse sera (data not shown).

One possible explanation is that the site of immunization (the muscle tissue) is not very accessible for neutralizing antibodies. Another possibility is that molecules involved in host-particle interaction in vivo may not be the same in vitro. It is known that some tissues express Fc receptors, which could be instrumental for antibodymediated alphavirus particle entry to the target cells and could bypass the viral receptor-mediated infection in vivo. A recent report showed that the alphavirus replicon can migrate quickly to draining lymph nodes after administration (49) . The authors speculated that DCs in muscle tissue may play a role in such migration, although it was not discussed whether DCs can circumvent particle neutralization from antivector antibodies. To understand the exact mechanism, studies of the microenvironment at the site of particle administration, including localization of expression of virally encoded proteins, and kinetics of inflammatory cell recruitment would also be required.",

Are these a sign of adverse effects caused by particle immunization? We think that this is unlikely the case because there is no dose dependence and even animals from PBS control groups died 1 day after challenge in independent experiments (data not shown). We consider that the early death event may be associated with the handling of animals when they are challenged. Otherwise we observed neither abnormal behaviors nor pathological signs in animals vaccinated with replicon particles. A recent clinical safety study of VEE replicon particles showed that only one serious adverse event, which was not associated with the study agent, had been observed in a total of 32 healthy volunteers who received as many as 1 \u03eb 10 8 IU of replicon particles three times (6) .",
