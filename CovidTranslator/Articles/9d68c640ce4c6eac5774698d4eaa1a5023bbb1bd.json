According to the OIE, risk analysis comprises hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. 4 Risk is defined in this context as the measure of the probability of the introduction of pathogens or other hazards to animals or animal populations. The hazard identification process seeks to establish which hazards (diseases) are of concern and how they may be introduced. Risk assessment is the process of estimating the probability or likelihood of hazard introduction, as well as the associated implications. The goal of risk management is to reduce both the likelihood and implications of the introduction of the identified hazards. The involvement of all potentially affected parties in the overall process (e.g., problem formulation, pathway and hazard prioritization, data collection and evaluation, result discussion and",

This increases the potential spread and complexity of trace-back during investigation, should a negative scenario unfold. Quarantine procedures and regulations for wild may be qualitative or quantitative depending on the needs of the users and the amount and type of data available. Often, it also must be informed by expert opinion in the wildlife community due to lack of hard data. There are scientific methods, such as the Delphi method, among others, for the collection and analysis of expert opinion that may be used to add rigor to this process. 9 Risk assessment is an iterative process as both models and data are often refined and updated over time. Usually a brief qualitative assessment gives a good indication of general risk, which allows for the collection and assessment of available data and the likelihood of successful quantitative modeling. Quantitative models may be simple, or deterministic, using point estimates that usually don't reflect the range or variability of the data. Stochastic models are used to incorporate uncertainty surrounding point estimates, and involve the need to match the question and available data with the appropriate tool and method-a more expert modeler should be included in the team if this approach is taken. Often, policy makers want quantitative answers where there are no data to support the kind of model that would produce the type of specific advice requested. Providing inaccurate estimations of the limitations of current results is a major pitfall in this process. Thus, communicating this potential mismatch effectively is a large part of risk communication between scientists and policy makers.",

Entry risk involves all steps in the pathways from countries of origin to the US ports of entry (i.e., incoming threats). Exposure involves any steps following entry in which an imported animal could potentially expose US populations of animals or people (i.e., US vulnerability to incoming threats). Consequences involve the severity of consequences that are likely to occur following exposure of US populations (either animal or human, to incoming threats).",

The reality is that in wildlife and/or disease risk analyses there are often so few data available that the analyst begins, subconsciously, to substitute value judgments for facts. Indeed, in assessing the consequences of disease introduction, for instance, a degree of subjectivity is almost unavoidable. While this may be less true for laboratory settings, it is more likely when assessing disease or environmental risks in freeranging wildlife. Risk analyses are seldom truly objective, and for this reason transparency in declaring all assumptions made is essential. 11 Most assessments go through several iterations, with data collection needs (gaps) highlighted, that are then either filled or augmented with gathered expert opinion. It is very important not only to cite the source of all data, but also to estimate the quality of the data as a contribution to an overall assessment of uncertainty surrounding results. Thus, risk analysis, although often policy driven, must be a scientifically honest evaluation of what we know and don't know. Transparency itself is a commitment to open communication.",

This represents the greatest gap in information for this assessment and presents a major opportunity for innovation that would help assess the risks outlined or exemplified in this assessment.

Many times these are disease prevention and control strategies, such as vaccination and treatment of individuals or populations, or personal protective measures, such as wearing gloves and masks for humans facing zoonotic diseases. The idea is to rerun the model under different conditions or assumptions to see how the risk changes in response to intervention actions. Sensitivity analysis-the process of examining the impact of the variation in individual model inputs on the model outputs in a quantitative risk assessment-is often performed to accomplish this. Many times, cost is entered into the equation as well in order to conduct cost-benefit analyses of different management options. The result is a very powerful tool for management authorities to analyze not only risk, have little evidence-based information for pathogenesis in captive wildlife, or for how transmission may occur across the species barriers. This is another large data gap that affects the consequence assessment and presents further opportunity to support research on both the ecology and pathogenesis of these agents beyond the normal domestic animal realm. There is evidence that there is some level of risk of RVF transmission to US livestock from the importation of wildlife species. While the number of imports that are most likely to provide a risk of RVF transmission are relatively few compared to the overall large volume of imports, the consequences of a transmission event would be extensive. Because of this risk, we have recommended investment in further areas of research and further risk reduction measures.",

For example, what is the risk of reintroducing great apes into the wild? Can we ever hope to create a situation where there is zero risk of disease introduction? However, in our passion and excitement, we may convince managers and funders to move forward with little regard for potential implications if this is not discussed up front.
