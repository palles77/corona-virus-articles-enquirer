Monitoring body temperature at hospitals, airports, and border crossing points is critical for preventing outbreaks and epidemics. 8, 11, 12 Recently, mass screening of all suspected febrile visitors at the entrance of every hospital building has become standard procedure. 8, 11, 12 Oral and aural temperature measurements are accurate but are fairly invasive, time-consuming, labor-intensive and skill-dependent. 8 The ideal device for fever screening should be rapid, noninvasive and be able to accurately detect patients with fever. Infrared thermography (IRT) has the potential to serve as a tool for mass screening for fever. 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] Current IRT systems in use at various border checkpoints have not been scientifically validated, particularly with regard to the false-negative rate. 8 The unadjusted mode threshold temperature setting in a thermal imager needs to correct the difference between the skin and core body temperatures. 8 It often has to take into account the effects of environmental and ambient conditions, and the thermal imager's performance parameters. 8 This study was designed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of each thermal imager and to compare the influence of different instruments, ambient temperature discrepancy, and the distance between the subject and the instrument.",

The DITI system has two components: a sensor head and a PC imaging workstation. The DITI system can measure between 10\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C at 60 frames per second. The minimum change in temperature that can be detected is 0.07\u00b0C. The DITI system can measure the skin temperature of the face, especially the frontal and the temporal area, to screen febrile patients. 21, 22 In Spectrum 9000MB fever test mode, the alarm sounds when thermographic temperature is > 37.5\u00b0C, as expected in a febrile patient. When a subject was found to have thermographic temperature > 37.5\u00b0C, the ear drum temperature was measured to confirm whether the patient had a fever (38\u00b0C).

Screening tests for fever at the entrance of hospitals is mandatory in some countries. 8, 11, 12 Due to the large volume of visitors who enter a hospital each day, a less timeconsuming and reliable method to screen body temperature is needed. In this study, we used the DITI system with a high resolution to screen large numbers of visitors in an efficient, non-contact and noninvasive manner. Ng et al reported that human skin surface temperature is correlated with core body temperature to a certain extent. 8 This is also consistent with our study (Tables 1-4) . It is risky to use a fixed physiological site offset to correlate both temperatures for the threshold temperature setting as the skin surface changes at different ambient temperatures (Table 4 ) and in different environments (Tables 1-3 ). The ambient temperature discrepancy at any gradient significantly affected the measurements. A significant difference was found by ICC analysis between temperature gradient and the different instruments ( Figure 3 ). ICC analysis between different distances and instruments revealed a significant difference, especially at a distance of 10 m from the hospital entrance (Figure 2) .",

Anyone whose skin surface temperature exceeds this temperature is suspected to have fever. 8 From ROC analysis, we found that the most reliable alarm threshold for the different modalities was 37.5\u00b0C for ear drum IRT, 36.05\u00b0C for thermoguard, 36.25\u00b0C for lateral view DITI, and 36.25\u00b0C for frontal view DITI. An alarm temperature set at 36.25\u00b0C will be the most reliable threshold for DITI. However, the selected threshold temperature of 36.25\u00b0C revealed a low specificity in lateral view DITI (specificity 48.3%, sensitivity 100%) and in frontal view DITI (specificity 52.4%, sensitivity 100%) ( Table 5 ). The low specificity may exaggerate the number of fever patients screened in such an acute lethal epidemic and assist with the strict isolation of infected individuals. Any tested temperature that exceeds this level will trigger the alarm, and an ear drum IRT can be used to verify whether the person has fever.",

The targeted areas varied from traditional ear drum, and the lateral or frontal view of the face as tested by different instruments (IRT, DITI, thermoguard). Following regression analysis, readings from variable targeted areas reached the same reliability. IRT set at 10 m from the entrance of the hospital could overcome the resulting problems caused by distance and temperature gradient; this was consistent with the study of Chan. 12 Other limitations of this study include the relatively small number of febrile subjects (only 36 in a total of 1032 visitors), and the number of subjects in the outdoor/ indoor temperature discrepancy subgroups were uneven. This study suggests that temperature readings obtained by remote-sensing IRT could be used as a proxy for core temperature. The optimal distance for IRT is at 10 m from the entrance. The preset threshold cut-off alarm temperature should be set at 37.5\u00b0C for ear drum IRT, 36.25\u00b0C for lateral view DITI, 36.25\u00b0C for frontal view DITI, and 36.05\u00b0C for thermoguard.
