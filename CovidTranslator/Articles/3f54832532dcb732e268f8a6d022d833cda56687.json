            "text": "Monitoring of long-term stability of proteins on paper-based membranes is important as it is directly related to paper-based sensor fabrication. By using a simple piezo printhead inkjet printer, recombinant proteins and antibodies were printed on paper-based membranes to test their stability and sensitivity under varying lengths of storage and temperature conditions. Our data show that a printed IgG-HRP antibody on simple printing paper maintains >50% functionality up to \u223c2 months under 4 and \u221220\u00b0C storage. Antibodies printed on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and nitrocellulose showed 5.3 and 9.7% decreases, respectively, in initial signal intensities compared to printing paper. Prostate-specific membrane antigen and tumor necrosis factor alpha recombinant proteins printed on paper-based membranes can be detected by antibodies, and antibody signal intensities can be detected up to 28 days after storage at 4 and \u221220\u00b0C when printed on PVDF membrane or printing paper. These data suggest that printed proteins on simple printing paper and PVDF membrane can maintain their functionality up to few months when stored at 4\u00b0C or lower and can be potentially applied in paper-based sensor development.",

As alternatives to these high technology sensing platforms, colorimetric and immunosensors are still popular in clinical use. 17\u221219 These immunosensors are based on immobilized capturing antibodies, and virus particles/antigens captured on antibodies were detected by detection antibodies. 20, 21 Colorimetric/immunosensing platforms are widely used in various viruses, antigens, and pollutant detection systems; however, most of the studies of these paper-based sensors focus on detection sensitivity and not stability or storage conditions. 22 \u221224 In addition, a large number of paper-based sensing membrane systems have adopted chemically treated membranes to enhance protein/ antibody adsorption and stability, 25\u221227 but comparative studies of protein stability and detection sensitivity on different paperbased membranes are rare. To verify the stability of printed proteins on paper-based membranes and to fill the gaps in research, we conducted systematic studies of protein stability and sensitivity on three different paper-based membranes. We also conducted long-term monitoring of printed proteins/ antibodies on paper-based platforms with varying storage temperature conditions to identify an optimal storing period and temperature for printed proteins.",

            "text": "We first tested whether inkjet-printed proteins on a paperbased membrane are functional. We focused on maintenance of functional ability of printed HRP and structural integrity of printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 proteins. Varying concentrations of anti-IgG HRP antibodies (1\u2212100 \u03bcg/mL) were printed on printing paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes, and the HRP substrate was added to detect signals from the printed antibodies ( Figure 1A ). As low as 1 \u03bcg/mL of printed IgG-HRP antibodies can be detected on paper-based membranes ( Figure 1B,C) , which suggests that piezo inkjet printing does not induce changes or damage to the function of printed antibodies. The concentration of the anti-IgG-HRP antibody versus the chemiluminescence signal intensity from the printed IgG-HRP plot showed a linear relationship, with R-squared values of 0.952, 0.931, and 0.946 for printing paper, nitrocellulose membrane, and PVDF membrane, respectively ( Figure 1C ). These data suggest that the signal intensity from printed IgG-HRP is a good reflection of the concentration of IgG-HRP. IgG-HRP-printed printing paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes were stored at three different temperature conditions: r.t. (\u223c22\u00b0C), 4, and \u221220\u00b0C, to test the effect of storage temperature on printed protein functionality and stability. Chemiluminescence signal intensities from printed IgG-HRP antibodies on printing paper and nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes showed less than 10% variation, which suggests that the binding capacity of the three paper-based membranes tested are quite similar. The HRP signal from printed IgG-HRP on printing paper decreased rapidly during the initial 5 days when stored at r.t. However, 4 and \u221220\u00b0C significantly increased printed protein stability, and the signal intensity from HRP remained >50% up to 60 days. Signals from printed HRP on printing paper can be detected up to 180 days when stored at \u221220\u00b0C. These data suggest that storing temperature is critical in maintaining printed protein functionalities. However, when the same protein was printed on the nitrocellulose membrane, the signal intensity from HRP dropped rapidly over the first 2 days, regardless of storage temperature ( Figure 2C ). Although protein molecules bind to nitrocellulose membranes through hydrophobic interactions, printed proteins on nitrocellulose membranes lose functionality in a very short amount of time. IgG-HRP antibodies printed on PVDF also showed significant signal intensity drops over the first 5 days; however, signals from HRP can be detected up to 6 months when stored at 4 and \u221220\u00b0C.",

            "text": "We next tested whether printed proteins on paper-based membranes can be detected by antibodies. Two recombinant proteins, PSMA and TNF-\u03b1, were printed and HRP conjugated antibodies against the two proteins were used to detect the printed proteins. Although signals from anti-PSMA-HRP and anti-TNF-\u03b1 HRP were lower compared to the directly printed IgG-HRP antibody, printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 were still detected when printed on all three paper-based membranes. Signal intensities from the detection antibody were highest on printing paper followed by PVDF and nitrocellulose membrane; however, they did not show a linear relationship with the concentration of printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure 3C,D) . These data may suggest that the signal intensities from colorimetric/immunosensors may not exactly reflect the actual concentration of antigens. We again tested whether printed proteins can be detected by detection antibodies after storage at various storage temperatures. It took \u223c3 days for signals to be reduced to half of the initial intensity from printed proteins on printing paper ( Figure  3A,D) . Storage temperatures have a minimal effect on signal intensity in the first 3 days; however, storing at \u221220\u00b0C increases printed protein stability after 7 days of storage.",

Storing at 4 and \u221220\u00b0C also increases printed protein stability compared to r.t. Printed PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 antibodies on the PVDF membrane and printing paper retains >50% activity for 4.1 and 3.5 days, respectively, when stored lower than 4\u00b0C. Two antibodies on the PVDF membrane and printing paper retains >25% activity for 14.2 and 5.8 days when stored at \u221220\u00b0C. PSMA and TNF-\u03b1 printed on the nitrocellulose membrane showed significantly reduced signal intensities from detection antibodies compared to printing paper and PVDF membranes ( Figure 4B ,E). Low-temperature storage increases the chemiluminescence signal upon storing; however, the signal only lasts up to 7 and 14 days for PSMA and TNF-\u03b1, respectively. These data suggest that although nitrocellulose membranes are quite often used for various protein detection purposes, immobilized protein stability upon storing cannot be guaranteed compared to the PVDF membrane or even simple printing paper.",
