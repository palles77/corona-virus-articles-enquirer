Here the mechanism of this activity is revealed by the crystal structure of a protein complex consisting of Nef, the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain (MHC-I CD), and the \u03bc1 subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein complex 1. A ternary, cooperative interaction clamps the MHC-I CD into a narrow binding groove at the Nef-\u03bc1 interface encompassing the cargo-recognition site of \u03bc1 and the proline rich strand of Nef. The Nef C-terminus induces a novel conformational change in \u03bc1, while the Nterminus binds the Nef core to position it optimally for complex formation. Positively charged patches on \u03bc1 recognize acidic clusters in Nef and MHC-I. The structure shows how Nef functions as a clathrin-associated sorting protein to alter the specificity of host membrane trafficking and enable viral evasion of adaptive immunity.",

Structural studies on Nef and its interaction complex with Src-family kinases 15 show that Nef consists of a folded core domain and two long, flexible loops, one at the N-terminus (residues 24-68) and one close to the C-terminus (148-178) [15] [16] [17] [18] . The regions of Nef important for MHC-I downregulation include an N-terminal \u03b1-helix, an acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65), a (PxxP) 3 repeat at the junction of the N-terminal loop and the folded core, and residue Asp123 19, 20 . The acidic dileucine motif in the C-terminal loop is not required for the downregulation of MHC-I, although it is crucial for the binding of Nef to AP2 and the downregulation of CD4, the cellular receptor for the virus [7] [8] [9] [10] 19, 21 . Despite this progress, most Nef binding events remain incompletely characterized. In particular, little is known about the formation of the Nef/MHC-I/AP1 complex at the structural level.",

The protein was purified to homogeneity by using Ni-NTA gravity flow, HiTrap SP cation exchange column, and Sephadex 200 gel filtration column. All MBP-\u03bc1 mutants (and the GST-CD-Nef mutants below) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method. The mutants of MBP-\u03bc1(158-423) and wt MBP-\u03bc2 (159-435) were expressed and purified similarly as for the wt MBP-\u03bc1.",

We assembled the complex using a construct of the MHC-I CD fused to the N-terminus of Nef 8, 10 . This fusion protein binds to \u03bc1 directly, and the effects of various mutations on binding in vitro largely recapitulate the behavior of MHC-I downregulation by Nef in vivo 10 . The potential artifact caused by the fusion design was a concern initially, however, the crystal structure demonstrates that the linkage is in a flexible region of Nef and does not affect the structure (see below). We obtained three crystal forms diffracting to 2.6 \u00c5, 2.9 \u00c5, and 3.3 \u00c5 resolutions (Table 1) and observed a total of six independent Nef/MHC-I CD/\u03bc1 complexes of the same structure in the asymmetric units of the crystals.

The membrane-proximal end of MHC-I CD forms an extended strand that augments the \u03bc1 \u03b2-sheets at the side of the cargo recognition site, with Tyr320 of the MHC-I CD in the tyrosine-binding pocket of \u03bc1. The binding is secured by the proline-rich strand (PxxP repeats) of Nef that runs along the MHC-I CD to form the other arm of the clamp. Nef is further affixed to \u03bc1 by extensive contacts at the core domain and by crucial electrostatic interactions involving its acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65). The C-terminus of Nef, together with a region of \u03bc1 disordered in the previous structure 22 , forms a snug pocket at one end of the binding groove to cradle a tight turn of the MHC-I CD (residues 327-332) (Fig. 1c) .

The Cterminal domain of \u03bc1 (residues 158-423) remains as a banana-shaped structure of mostly \u03b2strands 22 , with a slight twist (~10\u00b0) along its long axis upon complex formation ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). An unstructured region of \u03bc1 (residues 218-231) becomes ordered to interact with both Nef and the MHC-I CD. The core domain of Nef has the same structure as seen previously, while the functionally important acidic cluster (62-EEEE-65) and the PxxP repeats (68-78) swing to a different trajectory to interact with \u03bc1 ( Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The N-terminal helix of Nef is observed for the first time to be attached to the protein's core, on the side opposite the MHC-I binding site (Fig. 1) . Much of the Nef N-and Cterminal loops (27-56 and 162-174) are disordered and not seen in the structure. In addition, the connecting region of the MHC-I CD/Nef fusion protein, including the last nine residues of MHC-I, a two-residue linker (TS), and the first four residues of Nef, is also disordered. This flexible region of 15 residues can span up to 55 \u00c5 in distance, while its two ends observed in the structure are only 28 \u00c5 apart, suggesting that the fusion linker is unlikely to cause any distortion of the structure.",

The largest binary interface, 1058 \u00c5 2 , occurs between Nef and \u03bc1 and falls into the category of weak, transient binding 24 . The MHC-I/\u03bc1 and MHC-I/Nef interfaces bury 771 \u00c5 2 and 437 \u00c5 2 , respectively, predicting that no binary complexes would form with MHC-I. In contrast, all three components together generate a total of 2266 \u00c5 2 buried area in a strong three-protein complex. This analysis also points to a possible sequence of the binding events. The association between Nef and AP1 may take place first as their buried surface area predicts the only likely binary binding event. The binding groove is then created at the Nef-\u03bc1 interface to sequester the MHC-I CD. Consistent with this scenario, we are able to show that the Nef-\u03bc1 binary complex can form at high protein concentrations (~30 \u03bcM) ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , although this interaction is not strong enough to be detected by in vitro pulldown 10 . This is corroborated by the weak, binary interaction between Nef and \u03bc1 previously reported 6, 25 . Moreover, the binding of Nef to \u03bc1 is enhanced by the presence of the MHC-I CD 7,10 , which further supports the cooperative nature of the three-protein interaction.",

The binding geometry closely resembles that of the Yxx\u03d5 peptide binding to \u03bc2 of AP2 (Fig. 2a) 14 . However, the lack of a bulky hydrophobic side chain at the Y+3 position (Fig. 2b) in the MHC-I CD (320-YSQA-323) results in an empty hydrophobic pocket on \u03bc1 (Fig. 2c) , which explains why MHC-I is not recognized by AP1 in the absence of Nef.

The last two PxxP repeats (72-PQVPLRP-78) form the major component of the sidewall of the MHC-I CD binding groove. This region of Nef likely plays a confinement role to prevent the MHC-I CD from diffusing away, as only weak van der Waals interactions occur between these two proteins along the groove, with all interatomic distances over 3.5 \u00c5. The Nef chain makes a 90-degree turn immediately upstream of the binding groove. This sharp turn is pivoted at the first PxxP repeat (69-PVTP-72) and is stabilized by stacking interactions with \u03bc1 (Fig. 2d) . The turn changes Nef's binding trajectory on \u03bc1 and leads to an important electrostatic interaction involving the Nef 62-EEEE-65 residues (described below).",

This helix, as part of the flexible Nterminus of Nef, was previously predicted to be detached from the core 32 . It is nonetheless important, as deletion of part of it, or mutation of Met20 within the helix, abolishes the Nefmediated downregulation of MHC-I 9,20,26 . Our structure shows instead that the helix is anchored via two hydrophobic residues, Trp13 and Met20, to the surface of the Nef core opposite the MHC-I binding site. Rather than directly participating in intermolecular binding, the N-terminal helix-core association is predicted to bring the Nef core close to the membrane, facilitating interaction with the MHC-I CD and the AP1 complex. Consistent with an important helix-core anchoring interaction, either W13A or M20A mutation in Nef abolished the downregulation of MHC-I in human T lymphocytes (Fig. 4b) .

In the region corresponding to the Nef-induced \u03bc1 helix-turn structure, a much longer loop exists in \u03bc2, which is unlikely to adopt the same conformation ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . \u03bc2 also lacks the important Tyr residue (Tyr374 in \u03bc1) that stacks onto Nef Pro72 to stabilize the sharp Nef turn (Fig. 2 and 5) . Furthermore, \u03bc2 does not have the essential basic patch that attracts the Nef acidic cluster to secure the complex formation. Indeed, the Nef-MHC-I CD construct does not interact with \u03bc2 in our in vitro pulldown experiments (Fig. 5c) . These differences highlight an important distinction between the two otherwise highly homologous \u03bc subunits in AP1 and AP2, which may contribute to different interactions with distinct cellular sorting proteins and cargos. The lack of interaction between Nef and \u03bc2 also suggests an explanation for why Nef uses a distinct mode of interaction -its acidic dileucine motif and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2-to downregulate CD4 33, 34 .",

A striking co-planar arrangement is revealed for the Nef N-terminal myristoylation site, the MHC-I CD membrane-proximal end, and multiple phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) binding sites on AP2 35 , consistent with the formation of the complex along the lipid bilayer in vivo. The co-planar arrangement of all of the membrane attachment sites underlines the accuracy of this model. Through myristoylation and the anchoring of its N-terminal helix to the core, Nef is positioned at an optimal distance from the lipid membrane to bind the AP1 complex, an event that likely occurs after the recruitment of AP1 to the membrane by the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) 36, 37 . The Nef-\u03bc1 interaction may also contribute to induce the active, open conformation of AP1, through electrostatic attractions resembling those involving the PIP 2containing membranes 35 . This interaction likely further stabilizes the membrane-association of AP1, as we have reported before 38 . The association of Nef and AP1 then creates a snug binding groove for the recruitment of the MHC-I CD and ultimately leads to packaging of MHC-I into the clathrin-coated vesicle.",

            "text": "Nef uses a wide range of structural features throughout its entire length to hijack the AP-1 complex and modulate the cell surface expression of MHC-I. Perhaps due to its highly cooperative nature, the interaction is very delicate: mutation of any of its key elements disrupts the complex and causes the loss of Nef activity. This provides a clear explanation for the observation that virtually every domain in Nef required for the modulation of MHC-I is also required for the co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins from human cells 26 . Moreover, our model explains why the dileucine motif in the C-terminus of native Nef is not active during the downregulation of MHC-I, yet it is functional as a trafficking signal when Nef is fused to the CD of MHC-I 39 . Our structure shows the cooperative Nef/MHC-I CD/\u00b51 ternary interaction is key to the recruitment of MHC-I to AP1. This conformation, however, precludes the involvement of Nef's dileucine motif as the binding site for [ED]xxxL[LI] motifs on the \u03b3 and \u03c31 subunits of AP1 40 is too distant (Fig. 6 ). In contrast, when MHC-I is covalently linked to Nef, the critical MHC-I recruitment step is bypassed, and any trafficking signal in Nef, including the dileucine motif, can contribute to the trafficking of the MHC-I-Nef fusion protein. Nevertheless, the principle of cooperative binding likely also applies to the mechanism by which Nef modulates CD4 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and AP2 41 , even though that interaction involves the dileucine motif of Nef and the \u03b1 and \u03c32 subunits of AP2 rather than \u00b52.",

            "text": "Our structure supports the notion of Nef as a virally encoded clathrin associated sorting protein (CLASP), which alters the breadth and specificity of cargo recognition by AP complexes 12 . The cooperative binding mechanism by which Nef enables an AP complex to recognize a suboptimal sorting sequence could be utilized by cellular CLASPs. For example, in murine MHC-I, the tyrosine residue corresponding to Tyr320 is required for the \"cross-presentation\" of exogenous antigens by dendritic cells, an event required for the priming of antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes 42 . This observation, together with the role of Tyr320 in the Nef-mediated modulation of MHC-I via AP1, led us and others to speculate that crosspresentation might involve AP-1 and a cellular CLASP that is reminiscent of HIV-1 Nef 8, 9 . Moreover, the positively charged clusters on \u03bc1 that contribute to the interaction between Nef and the MHC-I CD may function as binding sites for the acidic trafficking motifs of cellular proteins. For example, the cytoplasmic domain of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor contains acidic clusters that include glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and phospho-serine residues, and these sequences contribute to the interaction with AP1 43 .",
