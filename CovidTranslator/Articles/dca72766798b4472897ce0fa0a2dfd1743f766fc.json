Information on management practices was obtained by administering a questionnaire compiled using a modified Delphi technique. Data were analyzed using univariable and multivariable negative binomial regression. Overall, 30% of the calves in the study were shedding C. parvum oocysts, with at least one positive calf detected in 77% of herds. Within-herd prevalence ranged from 0 to 80%. Predictors significantly associated with an increased prevalence of shedding in multivariable modelling were the use of calf scour prophylaxis in cows (risk ratio [RR] 1.70, P < 0.01) and calves (RR 1.38, P = 0.02) and the feeding of milk replacer in the first week of life (RR 1.40, P = 0.02).

On dairy farms, disease associated with C. parvum infection occurs primarily in young calves. Infection spreads from animal to animal by the fecal-oral route, and large numbers of infective and resistant oocysts may be shed in the feces of infected calves (Nydam et al., 2001) . In addition, C. parvum is a zoonosis, and cattle have been implicated as a potential source of human infection via contamination of drinking water sources by oocysts shed in the feces of infected animals (Sischo et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "The results of several studies have revealed that C. parvum is very common among dairy calves. Sischo et al. (2000) found that 15% of 198 dairy calves under 3 weeks of age on 11 farms in the northeastern United States were shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts, with oocysts detected on 10 of the 11 farms. In a larger study, 59% of 7369 pre-weaned dairy calves on 1103 farms in 28 states shed Cryptosporidium oocysts, with a prevalence of 48% among 1607 calves aged 1-3 weeks old (Garber et al., 1994) . In Canada, C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of 59% of 386 calves under 6 months old on 16 of 20 British Columbia dairies (Olson et al., 1997) , while in Qu\u00e9bec, infected calves were found on 89% of 505 dairy farms (Ruest et al., 1998) . In 2002, the within-herd prevalence of C. parvum shedding by calves 7-21 days of age on 51 southwestern Ontario dairies ranged from 0 to 70% (Trotz-Williams et al., 2005a) . In 2003, a within-herd prevalence of 35% to 100% was found in a sample of calves under 1 month old on 11 dairy herds in the same region (Trotz-Williams et al., submitted for publication). Most chemotherapeutic agents and disinfectants are ineffective against this parasite (Korich et al., 1990; Weir et al., 2002) . Prevention of infection is, therefore, the most viable option for reducing the incidence and impact of infection in dairy calves.",

            "text": "Various studies have investigated the association between farm management practices and the occurrence of C. parvum on dairy farms. Potential risk factors for shedding identified by such studies have included large herd size, use of multi-cow maternity facilities, and a long calving season (Garber et al., 1994; Atwill et al., 1999) . However, factors associated with the prevalence of C. parvum infection and disease on farms may vary depending on geographical region. A calf-level study carried out on 11 dairies in southwestern Ontario identified the type of facilities (individual vs. multi-cow calving pens) in which calves were born as a factor significantly associated with the risk of C. parvum shedding. In that study, most of the variation in the risk of shedding occurred between herds, as opposed to within herds (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.4; Trotz-Williams et al., submitted for publication). Similarly, in 51 herds in southwestern Ontario from which calves were sampled in 2002, shedding of C. parvum showed apparent clustering within herds as opposed to within herds (ICC 0.2; Trotz-Williams et al., 2005a) . Although these herds, for the most part, had previous or current problems with diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis, the large herd-to-herd variation indicated that an investigation of herdlevel risk factors for shedding, rather than calf-level parameters, would be more likely to generate information that would effectively control C. parvum on farms. Therefore, the study reported here was carried out with the objective of identifying factors associated with the shedding of C. parvum oocysts at the herd level in southern Ontario.",

Using these assumptions with the <sampsi> command in Stata 8.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas) generated an estimated sample size of 40 farms per group for a power of 80% and a confidence level of 95% when analysing the effect of one exposure variable.

Criteria for participation were: anticipated availability of calves for sampling during summer and fall 2004 (the time of the study), location of the farms (no more than 5 hours' drive from the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC), University of Guelph), and willingness to complete a short questionnaire on farm management practices. In an attempt to optimize the external validity of the results of the work, veterinarians were asked to enrol farms representing as wide a range of farm management practices as possible. In addition, in order to further ensure that such farms would be included, as well as to encourage the recruitment of farms with a wide range of C. parvum within-farm prevalence, they were requested to recruit one farm without neonatal calf diarrhea problems ('non-diarrheic') for each farm recruited that was experiencing a high frequency of calf diarrhea ('diarrheic'). Definitions of 'diarrheic' and 'non-diarrheic' farms were subject to the interpretation of the veterinarians. All herds recruited were included in the study.",

Practitioners were asked to rank a list of farm and calf management practices to reflect the perceived importance of each factor in causing, directly or indirectly, Cryptosporidium infection and diarrhea among dairy calves. Participants were also encouraged to list any additional factors or practices considered to be important risk factors. The results were used to identify those factors ranked as most important by the group. The same group of veterinary practitioners was then asked to rank each factor in this second list to reflect its perceived importance. Management factors and practices from this second list that were considered by the group to be most important were used to construct survey questions for participating producers. The resulting questionnaire included questions on the management of cows and their calves in the perinatal period, colostrum feeding practices, feeding and housing of pre-weaned calves, cleaning of feeding utensils, and cleaning of maternity and calf housing areas. Following pre-testing on five farms, this questionnaire was administered on each farm by one of two research technicians in a standardized manner.",

The assumption of linearity was assessed for each continuous predictor by visual examination of smoothed scatterplots of the outcome against the continuous variable (Dohoo et al., 2003b) , and by tabulating the mean within-farm prevalence of C. parvum shedding by categories of the predictor, achieved using the <lintrend> command in Stata 8.0. Using either quartiles or cut-points that reflected the change in risk, as most appropriate, non-linear continuous predictors were transformed into categorical variables for unconditional and multivariable analysis. Because of the large number of predictors being screened, a liberal significance level of 25% in the univariable models was used as the criterion for inclusion of predictors in the multivariable models. Before model-building, groups of variables were checked for collinearity by examining covariance matrices for subsets of the variables. Where variables were found to be collinear, only the variable most significantly associated with the dependent variable in unconditional analysis was included in the model-building process. Because of the large number of variables that were significant at the 25% level of significance, variables were further screened by constructing 2 preliminary multivariable models before final model-construction. This was done by constructing one multivariable model including management variables concerning the prenatal and perinatal period (a 'perinatal' model), and another including those relevant to the pre-weaning period after removal of the calf from the calving area (a 'pre-weaning' model). Variables remaining in each of the final models from this process were then combined for construction of a single final model. For each multivariable model, predictors with significance levels lower than 5% (P < 0.05) were selected for inclusion by a manual backward elimination approach (Dohoo et al., 2003c) . Significance levels were evaluated for continuous and dichotomous predictors using Wald's test. The likelihood ratio test was used to assess the significance of categorical variables. During model-building, confounding was assessed by evaluating the effect of adding predictors to, and removing predictors from, the model. Predictors that, when added or removed, caused a change of more than 25% in the model coefficients, were considered confounders and were kept in the model regardless of their level of significance. Variables significant in the final model were checked for interaction by the inclusion of biologically appropriate two-way interaction terms. Statistically significant interaction terms (P < 0.05) were considered to be evidence of interaction, and were retained in the model.",

On the other hand, some practices that were reported as protective by other researchers appeared to be associated here with an increased prevalence of shedding; feeding milk replacer to dairy calves was associated with a decreased risk of shedding in New York State (Mohammed et al., 1999) , while in our study, the practice was associated with an increased prevalence of C. parvum. In addition, several factors reported as being significantly associated with C. parvum shedding in other publications, such as use of multi-cow versus individual calving facilities, contact between pre-weaned calves, and cleaning of calf housing areas (Garber et al., 1994; Sischo et al., 2000; Castro-Hermida et al., 2002) , showed no significant association with within-farm prevalence of C. parvum in our work.",

Controlling for other management factors included in the final model (Table 2) , the prevalence was 70% higher on farms using this type of prophylaxis than on farms where no prophylaxis was used in the cows. A plausible explanation for this finding could be that the use of such measures on farms may have been in response to a high incidence of calf scours in those herds. As prophylactic products marketed for calf scours have no known impact on the risk of cryptosporidiosis, the use of these products on farms affected by C. parvum in calves would be ineffective against scouring caused by Cryptosporidium infection. This explanation may also apply to the significant association between the use of calf scour prophylaxis in calves and increased prevalence of C. parvum shedding, with the prevalence of positive calves being 38% higher on farms using the products.",

The presence of concrete flooring is likely to facilitate more thorough cleaning than is possible when other types of flooring (sand, gravel or earth) are used (Castro-Hermida et al., 2002) . On the other hand, this variable may also be an indicator of higher quality housing in general, and of better calf management. Similarly, the finding that the prevalence, or the risk of a calf shedding C. parvum, was 39% lower on farms using soap or detergent when washing feeding utensils, may be related to better overall management on the farms. Alternatively, this finding may be a direct result of cleaner, and therefore less contaminated, feeding utensils.",

(1999) , the feeding of milk replacer to calves in the first week of life was associated with an increased prevalence of C. parvum shedding; the prevalence of shedding was 40% higher on farms feeding milk replacer to young calves than on farms where no milk replacer was fed to calves of this age. Although the variable representing herd size was dropped due to non-significance in the construction of the multivariable model, there was a moderate correlation between the size of farms and the feeding of milk replacer to calves in the first week of life (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.23), and the risk of shedding was significantly higher in larger herds. This may partially explain the observed positive association between the feeding of milk replacer and the risk of shedding.",

This information may be beneficial to veterinary practitioners and dairy producers involved in the prevention and control of C. parvum infection and disease in calves. However, because of the large number of variables investigated in this study and the fact that this is the first published study of this kind conducted in Ontario, these results provide only an indication of which practices may in reality be of importance. Repeating the study with a smaller number of predictor variables would be of value in confirming the results reported here. Moreover, in this work, sampling was carried out during the time of year when C. parvum is thought to be most prevalent in dairy calves in Ontario. Factors identified here as important predictors of oocyst shedding may, therefore, be of importance only in this season. Future herd-level studies might provide useful information on seasonal differences by including data collection in the winter as well as in summer months.",

Predictors found to be associated with increased within-farm prevalence of shedding were the use of calf scour prophylaxis in cows and calves, and feeding of milk replacer to young calves. Presence of concrete flooring in calf housing areas and use of soap or detergent when washing calf feeding utensils appeared to be protective management practices, as both were associated with reduced prevalence of shedding. It would appear that calf feeding and housing practices that facilitate good hygiene may be important in reducing the prevalence of C. parvum shedding in young dairy calves.",
