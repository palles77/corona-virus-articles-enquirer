Since the first outbreak of PDCoV in the United States in 2014, this novel porcine coronavirus has been detected in South Korea, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, and China. In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HN-2014, was isolated from piglets with severe diarrhea on a pig farm in Henan Province, China, and examined with a specific immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. Genomic analysis showed that CHN-HN-2014 shares 91.6%-99.4% nucleotide identity with other known PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of CHN-HN-2014 was further investigated in 5-day-old and 21-day-old piglets. Both kinds of piglets developed clear clinical symptoms, including vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and severe diarrhea, by 2 days postinoculation (DPI), and diarrhea persisted for about 5-6 days. Viral shedding was detected in rectal swabs until 14 DPI in challenged 5-day-old pigs and until 18 DPI in challenged 21-day-old pigs. At necropsy at 4 DPI, macroscopic and microscopic lesions were observed and viral antigen was detected in the small intestines with immunohistochemical staining. These data demonstrate that Chinese PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 shares high nucleotide identity with previously reported PDCoV strains and is pathogenic in 5-day-old and 21-day-old piglets.",

Based on a molecular evolutionary genetic analysis of known CoVs, the CoV ancestor is tentatively divided into a bat CoV lineage and a bird CoV lineage, which evolved into the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus and the genera Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus, respectively (Woo et al., 2012) . PDCoV is genetically close to the bird CoV lineage but infects pigs (Woo et al., 2012) .",

To date, it has been reported in at least 18 states of the United States, Canada, South Korea, China, Mexico, and Thailand (Wang et al., 2014b; Ma et al., 2015; Homwong et al., 2016; Janetanakit et al., 2016; Jung et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Zhang, 2016) . A retrospective epidemiological study showed that PDCoV was detected in pig samples as early as August 2013 in the United States (McCluskey et al., 2015) and in pig samples in South Korea in May 2014 . Some groups have recently reported the emergence of PDCoV in different areas of the Chinese mainland, and interestingly, we detected PDCoV in pig diarrhea samples collected as early as 2004 (Chen et al., 2015a (Chen et al., , 2015b Dong et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015a Wang et al., , 2015b . With increased concern about this newly emerging enteric disease, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, and singleplex RT insulated isothermal PCR methods have been developed to detect PDCoV in clinical samples Wang et al., 2014a; Song et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015 Zhang et al., , 2016 . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for PDCoV-specific serum antibodies, based on the PDCoV S1 or nucleocapsid protein, have also been used to determine the prevalence of anti-PDCoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) in pig serum (Su et al., 2015; Thachil et al., 2015) .",

The complete genome shared 91.6%-99.4% nucleotide identity with the other 50 PDCoV strains available in GenBank. Compared with those PDCoV strains, a 3-nt deletion was observed in the S gene of PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014, which was also present in most Chinese PDCoV strains, except PDCoV strains HKU15-44 and CHN-AH-2004. Compared with PDCoV strains CHN-AH-2004 and HKU15-155, a 3-nt insertion was present in the 3 0 untranslated region (UTR), as in most of the PDCoV strains. However, three Thailand PDCoV strains contained a 6-nt insertion and a 9-nt insertion in open reading frame (ORF) 1a and a cytosine deletion in the 3 0 UTR (Fig. 3) . A phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the PDCoV strains from the United States and South Korea clustered into a large clade, whereas PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 clustered with other PDCoV strains detected in China since 2014, and suggests that the US and South Korean clade and the Chinese clade might share a common evolutionary ancestor (Fig. 4) . Interestingly, the PDCoV strains from Thailand clustered in a clade quite distinct (Fig. 4) .",

However, only PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 was successfully isolated and confirmed with typical CPE, IFA, and EM. This PDCoV isolate caused obvious CPE on LLC-PK1 cells 24 h after their inoculation with the PDCoV-positive intestinal sample. After plaque purification and several passages, the viral titer was 10 8.0 TCID 50 /ml, suggesting that this PDCoV isolate was highly adapted to LLC-PK1 cells. Among the samples from which we attempted to isolate the virus, 12 of the feces samples and two of the intestinal contents samples showed cell toxicity. The success rate (1/21) of PDCoV isolation in this study was quite low. In previous studies, most of the PEDV strains have been isolated from intestinal contents samples (Chen et al., 2014; Oka et al., 2014) , and this was also reported by Hu et al., in their attempts to isolate PDCoV from different samples . Based on these results, we speculate that intestinal contents are ideal sources for PEDV and PDCoV, or even other enteric swine CoVs isolation. This might be attributable to the relatively low rate of cytotoxicity in intestinal contents samples, but many other factors, including the titer of the infectious virus in the samples and the sample preservation conditions, might also contribute to successful PDCoV isolation.",

However, the PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 genome is more similar to those of strains from China, the United States, and South Korea than to Thai strains. Previous studies have shown that the determinants of coronavirus tropism are located at the S1 region of the S protein (Masters, 2006) , and that the S protein of the CoVs might be strongly associated with the pathogenicity and virulence of the virus. One of the largest variations in the PDCoV S gene detected to date is a 3-nt deletion in the S1 region (Dong et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015a Wang et al., , 2015b Janetanakit et al., 2016) . A 3-nt deletion in the S gene relative to the S genes of the US and South Korean strains, which causes the deletion of an amino acid in the S protein, was also observed in PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014. Given that PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 is pathogenic, like the US strains, this 3-nt deletion alone might not determine the pathogenicity of PDCoV. However, the recently emerging PDCoV strains in Thailand are highly virulent, causing a mortality rate of 19.22% on pig farms (Janetanakit et al., 2016) . In our phylogenetic analysis, the PDCoV strains from Thailand clearly clustered in a separate clade (Fig. 4) , and in the genomic sequence alignment, they showed several distinct variations in ORF 1a and the 3 0 UTR compared with the other strains (Fig. 3) . This implies that these unique variations contribute to the strong virulence of the Thai strains.",

The pathogenicity of a PDCoV cell-culture-adapted strain, USA/IL/2014, was subsequently confirmed in 5-day-old conventional pigs (Chen et al., 2015a (Chen et al., , 2015b . The pathogenicity of another cell-culture-adapted strain, PdCV CVM1, was later tested in 10day-old gnotobiotic and conventional pigs, and the PDCoV Ohio CVM strain (from intestinal contents) was tested in 19-day-old gnotobiotic pigs (Ma et al., 2015) . Consequently, it has been confirmed that PDCoV is enteropathogenic in pigs of different age, from 5 to 19 days old. In the present study, 5-day-old and 21-dayold pigs were challenged with the same dose of PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014, and the severity of their clinical symptoms was compared under the same conditions. Our clinical observations show that the 5-day-old pigs were more susceptible to PDCoV infection than the 21-day-old pigs. This age-dependent disease severity in PDCoV infection is consistent with previous reports of PEDV and TGEV infections (Moon et al., 1975; Shibata et al., 2000) and might be attributable to the lower turnover rate of enterocytes in 5-day-old pigs than in 21-day-old pigs during PDCoV infection, as has been described in PEDV infection . A recent report showed that an outbreak of PDCoV infection was observed in gilts and sows in Thailand (Janetanakit et al., 2016) , indicating that the pathogenicity of PDCoV is not confined to piglets.",

            "text": "The viral fecal shedding pattern in the PDCoV-challenged pigs was detected with real-time RT-PCR. The PDCoV viral RNA shedding patterns reported in previous studies were limited to 7 DPI. In this study, we extended the observation period to 21 DPI. Surprisingly, viral shedding was detected in one of the 21-day-old challenged pigs at 18 DPI, but had ceased at 14 DPI in the 5-day-old pigs. Considering the differences in the clinical symptoms and disease severity of the 5-and 21-day-old pigs, we speculate that this abnormal result might be caused by individual differences in the pigs. In previous studies of PEDV-challenged pigs, viral RNA was detected beyond 21 DPI Lin et al., 2015) , which might indicate that the virulence of PDCoV is milder than that of PEDV in pigs. The viral RNA distribution in the 5-day-old PDCoV-challenged pigs was also tested. The intestines contained relatively high levels of viral RNA copies compared with the other tissues, and we detected no PDCoV viral RNA in the blood. Previous studies are inconsistent about virus detection in the blood (Chen et al., 2015a (Chen et al., , 2015b Ma et al., 2015) , and these differences might arise from the different time points at which the blood was sampled or the diversity among the different PDCoV strains. Mild interstitial pneumonia has also been identified in the lungs of PDCoV-infected pigs (Ma et al., 2015) . In this study, viral RNA was also detected in 1/2 lungs, 1/2 spleens, and 1/2 kidneys, but no gross lesions were observed in these tissues. Obvious gross lesions were only observed in the small intestines of the 5-day-old pigs at necropsy at 4 DPI. A previous study revealed that SARS-CoV infected a wide range of organs, although the respiratory tract was the major target of infection (Gu and Korteweg, 2007) . PDCoV infection might also infect multiple organs in pigs, but the major target organ is the intestinal tract. In previous reports, microscopic lesions associated with PEDV infection were observed in all sections of the small intestine , but microscopic lesions were only observed in the jejunum and ileum in this study, indicating that PDCoV infection is less severe in the intestinal tract than PEDV infection. All these data confirm that PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 induces enteric infections in pigs.",
