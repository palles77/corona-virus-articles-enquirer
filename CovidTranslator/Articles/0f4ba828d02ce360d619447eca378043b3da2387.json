He passed meconium at approximately four hours of age, and he seemed bright and alert. On the morning of April 15, the owners found the foal straining to defecate. The local veterinarian was called for further evaluation and found a quiet but alert foal with a normal rectal temperature and heart rate. Meconium staining was noted on the tail. Gastrointestinal sounds were audible on both sides of the abdomen. A digital rectal examination was performed, and firm meconium was palpable in the rectal ampulla. A nasogastric tube was passed. No reflux was obtained, thus 30 ml of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS) was given. In addition, 50 mg of flunixin meglumine was given intravenously and a DSS and water enema was administered. The foal continued to strain and was intermittently recumbent, prompting referral to the University of Georgia's Veterinary Teaching Hospital. At the time of presentation, '03 RockN'Roll was approximately 26 hours old. The foal was quiet, but tracked the mare well and was interested in nursing. The abdomen was slightly distended, and meconium staining was present on the tail and perineum. Shortly after admission, the foal was observed to raise his tailhead and strain",

Lethal white syndrome is most commonly reported in all-white to almost-all-white offspring of overo cross overo Paint Horses. In one study of 168 horses with congenital umbilical hernias, the incidence was two times greater in fillies compared to colts, and Thoroughbreds were twice as likely to have an umbilical hernia compared to Standardbreds. 9 In this later study, incarceration of bowel into the umbilical hernia was not reported. Scrotal hernias most commonly occur in Standardbred and Tennessee Walking Horse colts, 8 and fecaliths are frequently reported in American Miniature foals. 6, 10 In one study, meconium impactions occurred twice as often in colts compared to fillies. 11 Although the incidence of uroperitoneum is often quoted to occur more commonly in colts, in one recent study, the incidence was approximately equal among the sexes. 12 Additional historic information that should be carefully scrutinized is the general health of the dam, the foal's gestational age, the foaling history and general perinatal health, such as ingestion of colostrum, age at passage of meconium, nursing frequency (see Chapter 1 for review of normal perinatal health), and farm history of potentially infectious causes of enteritis or colitis (Salmonella, rotavirus, Clostridium). Most foals will have passed meconium within 9 to 12 hours of life; however, the gastrocolonic reflex stimulated by ingestion of colostrum frequently initiates earlier passage of meconium. Evacuation of meconium may be delayed (meconium retention) as the result of ileus secondary to another primary nongastrointestinal disease, such as septicemia or neonatal encephalopathy. In these cases, although passage of meconium may be slower than expected, the delay in passage may not be accompanied by clinical signs of abdominal pain. Passage of \"milk feces\" or yellow pasty feces does not necessarily indicate that all meconium has been removed from the colon.",

            "text": "Clinical signs of abdominal pain in foals can be highly variable, and the intensity of the signs is not necessarily indicative of the etiology. It is important to note that foals with inflammatory lesions of the intestinal tract or those suffering from general functional ileus secondary to systemic disease can act as violently painful as foals with obstructive or strangulating lesions of bowel. However, in general, foals suffering from uroperitoneum and gastric ulcers have less intense abdominal pain than do foals with inflammatory or obstructive lesions. Repeatedly thrashing or rolling from side to side is generally accepted as a highly representative clinical sign of abdominal pain. However, early signs of abdominal pain in neonatal foals may only manifest as reduced frequency of nursing and prolonged recumbency. Other subtle but significant signs of abdominal pain in foals include general restlessness, especially in recumbency, and/or frequent adjustment of recumbent positions (Figure 11 -2). Often recumbent foals with abdominal pain will stretch their limbs, twist their head or neck, roll into dorsal recumbency ( Figure 11-3) , and make frequent attempts or strain to either defecate and/or urinate. In the standing foal, signs that are classically associated with straining to defecate include frequent tail swishing, a \"water spout\" tail, and a \"camped under\" leg stance with a dorsiflexed back (Figure 11-1) . In contrast, a flat or ventroflexed back with the hindlimbs stretched backward and the tail held up is associated with urination ( Figure 11-4) . Other signs of abdominal pain include lip curling, flank biting or watching, pawing at the ground, and kicking at the abdomen. It is important to recognize that often critically ill foals that are stuporus will not overtly demonstrate classic signs of The colicky neonatal foal should receive a thorough general physical examination with careful attention given to identification of clinical signs or physical evidence of sepsis (see Chapter 5) . Sepsis may be directly associated with the primary etiology of the abdominal pain or it may develop secondary to bacterial translocation if the integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa is compromised. The presence of fever, depression, petechiae, injection, synovitis, uveitis, or diarrhea may be cardinal clues that the abdominal pain has an inflammatory etiology. Although the presence of diarrhea may be an important sign of enterocolitis, intense abdominal pain frequently precedes the onset of diarrhea. Tachycardia and/or tachypnea are expected findings despite etiology. Persistent tachycardia (heart rate >120 beats per minute) has been suggested to be more commonly associated with surgical disorders of the abdomen, compared to medical etiologies. 13 Gross abdominal distension will develop with gas or fluid accumulation in the bowel or abdomen. Severe abdominal distension with intense pain that elicits high-pitched \"pings\" with percussion is consistent with gas-distended large intestine or cecum. Repeated measurement of the abdominal circumference may be helpful in more objectively determining the course of progression of abdominal distension. Typically, the absence of intestinal sounds is not helpful in determining etiology; however, increased borborygmi may be associated with enteritis or colitis. If diarrhea is present with signs of abdominal pain in a foal, additional fecal diagnostics may be indicated (see .",

First, the hair from the ventral midline of the rostral abdomen should be clipped and the skin sterilely prepared. The subcutaneous tissue of the abdominocentesis site in the rostral midline of the abdomen should be infiltrated with 0.5 ml of 2% lidocaine. When a teat cannula is used, entry through the abdominal wall must be preceded by a stab incision made with a number 15 blade through the skin and external portion of the linea alba. Although use of an 18-gauge needle is expeditious, there may be a greater risk of inadvertent enterocentesis or bowel laceration; however, enterocentesis may also occur with a teat cannula if the intestine is grossly distended. Localized or generalized peritonitis may develop subsequent to an enterocentesis, and prophylactic use of parenteral antimicrobials is recommended.

The normal mean nucleated cell count in the peritoneal fluid of healthy foals was reported to be 450 cells/\u03bcl (range 60 to 1,400 cells/\u03bcl) for 17 foals that were 13 to 134 days of age 14 and 1,400 cell/\u03bcl (\u00b11077) for 32 Thoroughbred foals that were 14 to 75 days of age. 15 Both of these reference ranges for nucleated cell counts are lower than means reported for healthy adult horses. The mean protein concentration by biochemical biuret determination and refractive index in foals was reported to be 1.2 g/dl and 1.6 g/dl, respectively. 14 The interpretation of peritoneal fluid nucleated cell count and protein concentration is similar to adult horses with abdominal pain and does not necessarily definitively distinguish etiology or medical from surgical causes of colic. Sanguinous fluid can be present with either severe enterocolitis or strangulating lesions of bowel. Special attention should be given to the cytologic examination. The presence of degenerative neutrophils or bacteria is worrisome (Figure 11 -6) and is indicative of loss of the mucosal integrity, bowel rupture, or primary sepsis in the peritoneal cavity. In one study, 78% of colicky foals with peritoneal fluid protein concentrations >2.5 g/dl that subsequently underwent an exploratory laparotomy were euthanized. 8 When uroperitoneum is suspected, the creatinine concentration of both peritoneal fluid and serum should be simultaneously assessed. A peritoneal fluid creatinine to serum creatinine ratio >2 is supportive evidence of uroperitoneum. When determining peritoneal fluid creatinine concentration on an automated chemistry analyzer, it is important to use plasma or serum methodology on the abdominal fluid. If urine methodology is used to determine the creatinine concentration on a peritoneal fluid sample, erroneously increased creatinine concentration may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of uroperitoneum.

Grid, rare-earth screens and sufficient mAs (5 to 28) and kVp (80 to 120) should be used. 16 Radiographs may be taken with the foal either standing or in lateral recumbency; however, keep in mind that fluid-gas interfaces are easier to detect in the standing foal, when the radiographic beam is horizontal or perpendicular to the dorsoventral plane of the gas/fluid interface in the abdomen. Both right and left lateral views should be obtained as some structures will be more obvious, depending upon which side of the abdomen is closer to the film. Ventrodorsal views may only be possible in small foals or those that are stuporus, sedated, or anesthetized. This view will optimize identification of the pylorus, the descending duodenum, the base of the cecum, the left colon, and the transverse colon. 17 Some degree of gas is normally visible in the stomach, small intestine, cecum, and small colon. In general, plain film abdominal radiology is more likely to provide information on the anatomic location of the problem than information directly leading to the exact etiology. 8, 16, 17 For example, gas distension of the small intestine is a nonspecific finding that may occur with enteritis, functional obstruction (ileus), or mechanical obstruction (Figure 11-7) . However, if small-intestinal distension is accompanied by \"hairpin\" or \"U-shaped\" turns of the bowel ( Figure  11 -8) or multiple, uneven intraluminal gas-fluid interfaces ( Figure 11-9 ), it is more likely associated with mechanical obstruction, though these findings can also occur with enteritis or functional ileus. Thickened walls of small intestine may appear uneven or \"corrugated\" when caused by enteritis (Figure 11 -10). Severe generalized gas distension of large intestine is more commonly associated with mechanical obstruction than with inflammatory lesions of large colon ( Figure  11 -11) . Meconium frequently appears as granular contents in the ascending or descending colon ( Figure  11 -12) . Pneumoperitoneum suggestive of bowel This neonatal foal had radiographic signs of smallintestinal obstruction, as evidenced by isolated loops of gasdistended small intestine that form a U-turn or \"hairpin\" turn (arrows). An exploratory celiotomy confirmed a jejunal intussusception. Fig. 11-9 Radiographic appearance of small-intestinal disease. The presence of multiple gas-fluid interfaces at different levels is often considered radiographic evidence of smallintestinal obstruction; however, it can also be seen in foals with intense ileus from enteritis, as was the situation for the foal depicted in this figure. rupture should be suspected if there is a gas cap in the dorsal aspect of the abdominal cavity, if the serosal surfaces of bowel are enhanced, or if visualization of the renal silhouettes is improved. Iatrogenic pneumoperitoneum should be considered if an abdominocentesis was performed prior to abdominal radiography.",

Radiographic signs of pneumatosis intestinalis are spectacular and include localized cystic collections that appear as radiolucent \"bubbles\" in the bowel wall, or diffuse linear strips or flat oval-shaped areas of radiolucency in the bowel wall flanked by the radiopaque serosa and mucosa, when the bowel wall is viewed end-on. 18 Contrast radiography also has some specific indications in neonatal foals. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study can be used to document delayed gastric emptying of older foals with suspected pyloric outflow obstruction. 16 Foals less than two weeks of age ideally should be fasted for four hours, and foals consuming solid feeds should be fasted for 12 hours prior to contrast radiography. 17 Barium is administered by gravity flow via a nasogastric tube (5 ml/kg as a 30% weight/volume solution), and abdominal radiographs are obtained every 30 minutes. If barium remains in the stomach for longer than two hours, delayed gastric emptying should be suspected but does not necessarily distinguish between mechanical or functional obstruction. Barium should normally reach the cecum and transverse colon by two hours and three hours, respectively, in 10-to 12-day-old foals. 16, 17 Barium transit time to the transverse colon is five to eight hours in foals one to two months of age. In addition to documenting transit time, stenosis or abnormal bowel wall may be highlighted by the contrast (Figure 11-13 ). Lower-intestinal contrast studies (i.e., barium enema) have been reported to have 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for identifying mechanical obstruction (meconium impaction, atresia coli) of the transverse colon or small colon in foals less than 30 days of age ( Figure 11-14) . 19 The foal should be restrained or lightly Foals with enteritis may have numerous nonspecific radiographic findings, such as gas-distended small intestine and multiple gas-fluid interfaces. In the radiograph depicted here, the finding of individual loops of mildly to moderately gas-distended small intestine with irregular or \"corrugated\" walls is highly indicative of enteritis.

Scanning techniques for the foal abdomen are extensively reviewed elsewhere, 20 though a brief review follows here. Standard linear array 4 to 7 MHz transducers are sufficient for visualization of most intra-abdominal structures in the neonatal foal; however a curvilinear transducer will optimize image quality. The foal may be scanned in either lateral recumbency or standing; however keep in mind that fluid-filled, thickened, or enlarged structures may descend to the dependent portion of the abdomen and could be overlooked if only the nondependent side of a recumbent foal is scanned. Furthermore, gas in nondependent bowel, especially gas in large colon, may preclude examination of deeper structures in laterally recumbent foals. Visualization of intra-abdominal structures is facilitated by clipping the abdominal hair; however thorough wetting of the hair with water or alcohol, in addition to acoustic coupling gel, may be sufficient. In the colicky neonate, transabdominal ultrasonography can be used to identify fluiddistended structures (i.e. stomach, small intestine, large intestine, urinary bladder), gastric or intestinal wall thickness, abnormal intestinal contents (i.e. meconium, fecaliths, phytobezoars, or trichophytobezoars), peritoneal fluid, and to determine intestinal motility.",

Likewise, foals with enteritis or colitis will frequently have diffusely increased small and/or large intestine wall thickness ( Figure 11-15 ). This feature alone does not definitively identify enteritis, as edematous bowel that develops as the result of strangulation (volvulus or intussusception) will also appear regionally thickened ( Figure  11 -16), with distended fluid-filled intestine proximally.

The unique regional presence of a double intestinal wall or what appears to look like a \"bull's-eye\" of multiple concentric rings in a short axis view of small intestine is consistent with an intussusception (Figure 11-19) , which most commonly is seen in the dependent portion of the abdomen.",

The only published study on 20 foals less than two weeks of age with acute abdominal pain reported that an exploratory celiotomy revealed functional ileus (45%), meconium impaction (25%), large-colon displacement (15%), small intestine displaced around the base of the cecum (10%), ruptured gastric ulcer, and small colon obstructed by the ovarian ligament. 7 Other retrospective studies of abdominal surgery in the foal include foals three to six months of age and thus it was difficult to ascertain the etiology of abdominal pain exclusive to the neonatal period. In 53 foals that underwent an exploratory celiotomy from birth to three months of age, meconium impaction, uroperitoneum, enteritis, small-intestinal strangulation (herniation with incarceration, small-intestinal volvulus, and intussusception), and enteritis accounted for 80% of the total cases. 4 In a study that reviewed 83 foals up to six months of age, the most commonly reported diseases identified at surgery were small-intestinal volvulus, meconium impaction, and intussusception. 8 These reports underscore the difficulty in definitively identifying the cause of abdominal pain prior to exploratory celiotomy in neonatal foals, as clearly some of these cases, such as enteritis and functional ileus, would not be considered to be predominantly surgical diseases. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that if the etiology of the abdominal pain cannot be ascertained in the violently painful patient, an exploratory celiotomy may be indicated solely as a diagnostic tool. The purpose of this section is to provide a brief review of the conditions most commonly reported in the neonatal foal. ",

Ileocolonic aganglionosis, or \"lethal white\" syndrome, is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder principally of overo cross overo Paint Horses that is caused by a point mutation in amino acid 118 in endothelin receptor B. 26 The endothelin receptor is critical for the proper development and migration of cells from the neural crest that ultimately form melanocytes in the skin as well as neurons in the intestinal tract. Thus, foals that are homozygous for the mutation are essentially all white (though some small areas of pigmentation can occur) and develop signs of functional ileus in the first few hours of life ( Figure 11 -23). Color patterns in the dam and sire that have the highest incidence of heterozygote carriers of the mutation are frame overo, highly white calico overo, and frame blend overo horses. 26 However, the heterozygote mutation has been occasionally rarely detected in other white-patterned Paints and \"nonPaint\" whitepatterned bloodlines. It has not been detected in solidcolored breeding-stock Paint Horses without white, but heterozygote adult solid-colored Miniature Horses of Paint lineage and white-patterned horses of breeds other than the Paint Horse have been rarely identified. 26 Lethal white foals typically are born \"normal\" in appearance and behavior, with the exception of the mostly white coat. Clinical signs of abdominal pain usually develop in the first few hours of life, after ingestion of colostrum, and progressively develop gross abdominal distension. Evidence of passage of meconium is often missing, though some meconium may be passed. The only way to definitively identify a lethal white foal is by DNA testing for the mutation or histopathologic demonstration of insufficient intestinal ganglia. Unfortunately, it can take weeks to obtain the results of DNA testing and hours to days to obtain the results of intestinal biopsies. Diagnosis is often initially presumptive, based on signalment, heterozygote parents, lack of response to symptomatic treatment, and rule out of other causes by additional diagnostics or surgical exploratory. Affected foals and heterozygote adults can be identified by submitting plucked hair with intact root bulbs from the mane (preferred sample) to the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the University of California, Davis, available at www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/service/horse/coatcolor.html. It should be noted that not all white foals of Paint lineage are lethal whites and when tested, these unaffected, rare, all-white Paint Horses are not homozygous for the mutation.",

Volvulus of the small intestine is the most commonly reported strangulating lesion in foals less than three months of age. 8 Factors leading to development of 204 these lesions are undetermined, but alterations in motility may contribute. Intussusceptions are most commonly reported in three-to five-week-old foals 2 and may be acute or chronic and intermittent. Smallintestinal intussusceptions are most frequent, but ileocecal and cecocolic intussusceptions have been reported in young foals. 28 Most inguinal and umbilical hernias in foals resolve spontaneously without incarceration of intestine. 8, [29] [30] [31] [32] In a large retrospective study of 147 foals with umbilical hernias, only 13 required surgical repair. 29 Only 4 of the 13 foals that needed surgery had incarcerated bowel in the umbilical hernia. Although the hernias were present since birth, and strangulation may rarely occur shortly after birth, the majority of foals with strangulating umbilical hernias were not neonates, but most often, affected foals were presented in the first six months of life. 31 The most common presenting complaint in foals with an umbilical hernia with incarcerated bowel was an acute firm enlargement of the hernia that was sensitive upon palpation. Only 30% of foals with strangulated umbilical hernias presented with signs of abdominal pain.",

Diagnosis should be suspected by the presence of an irreducible mass in the scrotal sac, edema in the scrotum and prepuce, and colic. Diagnosis of either an umbilical or scrotal hernia with incarceration can usually be confirmed by palpation and ultrasonography. It has been suggested that elective herniorrhagy should be considered if an umbilical hernia has been present in foals greater than six months of age or if the defect is larger than 10 cm. 31 Diaphragmatic hernias are rare in foals and can result from failure of fusion of its embryonic components or from traumatic rupture of the diaphragm in utero, at birth, or after birth. 33 Affected foals can remain asymptomatic for prolonged periods of time, but the presenting complaint typically is acute abdominal pain. The intensity and onset of clinical signs is related to the amount of intestine that has herniated into the thoracic cavity and whether the herniated bowel is simply displaced or strangulated. 33 In addition to abdominal pain, tachypnea and/or dyspnea may be present. The diagnosis can be confirmed by either radiographic or ultrasonographic evidence of an incongruous diaphragmatic line, the presence of gas-fluid interfaces indicative of intestine in the thoracic cavity, and/or pleural effusion.",

Simple solutions, such as reducing or eliminating enteral feeding, changing the source of milk, or correction of electrolyte derangements and other underlying disorders should be tried first. However, it may be necessary to consider an exploratory celiotomy for definitive diagnosis and for therapeutic decompression of bowel before initiation of prokinetic therapy.

At the University of California, Davis, from 1987 to 2002, 41 out of 44 foals (93%) with meconium impactions were successfully treated medically with acetylcysteine enemas. 11 About 40% of these former cases required more than one acetylcysteine enema, and in about 20% of cases it took more than 12 hours for the impaction to resolve. Once hospitalized, '03 RockN'Roll received one acetylcysteine enema and oral laxative and intravenous fluid therapy over 12 hours. Prior to surgery, the foal exhibited only mild to moderate signs of intermittent pain (straining to defecate with recumbency and rare dorsal recumbency) and his abdominal size did not significantly increase. The discovery of pneumoperitoneum before celiotomy was worrisome. However, because an abdominocentesis had been performed several hours prior to taking the abdominal radiograph, it was speculated that the pneumoperitoneum was iatrogenic from introduction of room air through the abdominocentesis needle into the peritoneal cavity. The subsequent detection of a ruptured transverse colon during surgery was an unexpected complication. Spontaneous rupture of the colon as a sequela to meconium impaction must indeed be rare, as there are no reports of its occurrence in the American literature.

The foal did not exhibit intense signs of abdominal pain, in fact, he only showed signs of straining to defecate during the first 10 hours of hospitalization. Although he received an analgesic dose of flunixin meglumine prior to referral, he only received one other shortacting analgesic prior to surgery: 1 mg of butorphanol. The abdominocentesis was performed at approximately 10 hours of hospitalization, after the foal was observed to roll into dorsal recumbency. Although the nucleated cell count and protein concentration were both increased, there were no signs of sepsis cytologically. Either rupture had not yet occurred or it had already occurred and the peritoneal fluid sample obtained by abdominocentesis was not representative. In retrospect, the pneumoperitoneum seen radiographically at 12 hours of hospitalization most likely was indicative of a localized rupture. The decision to perform an exploratory celiotomy was based upon the lack of passage of a significant amount of meconium, the presence of extensive amounts of meconium in the colon (as seen ultrasonographically and radiographically), the presence of free air in the peritoneal cavity on abdominal radiographs, and the development of persistent tachycardia, with a sustained heart rate greater than 120 beats/minute.",

In the neonate, ulcers are often present with concurrent diseases, such as enteritis or sepsis. The history should be utilized to determine if the foal had any prior illnesses, including diarrhea, colic, lethargy, or anorexia. Furr found that foals stressed by disease were more likely to have abnormal cortisol, T3, T4, and reverse T3 levels than age-matched normal controls foals. These stressed foals had a higher incidence of gastric ulceration than the normal foals. 4 The clinical findings associated with ulcers can range from asymptomatic to death secondary to severe peritonitis from gastric rupture. A study in Japan of 40 foals with gastric ulceration found that the most prevalent clinical signs were depression and intermittent nursing (82.5% of affected foals) followed by diarrhea (65%), colic (37.5%), bruxism (10%), and ptyalism (7.5%). 5 Affected foals will often lay in dorsal recumbency trying to be more comfortable. Spontaneous gastric reflux from the nostrils can be seen on rare occasion. Foals with suspected or confirmed ulcers should be evaluated closely for sepsis or signs of peripartum asphyxia, as ulcers may develop secondary to these conditions. Some clinicians associate the stress of orthopedic disease in foals to be a risk factor for the development of gastric ulcerations. ",

Usually this can be accomplished with a 1-meter endoscopy. The foal should be fasted for approximately two hours before scoping so that the gastric mucosa can be viewed better. The examination should be systematic being sure to view the distal esophagus and the squamous and glandular portions of the stomach. Lesions may vary from a mild hyperemia or gastritis to deep bleeding ulcerations ( Figure  11-28, A and B) . Another finding of gastroscopy in young foals is a desquamation of the squamous epithelia. This occurs in 80% of foals less than 35 days of age. Sheets of squamous epithelia shed during this time period. This can occur with or without ulceration (Figure 11-29 ). 6 Radiographs of the abdomen may be useful in ruling out other causes of colic in the foal. The presence of free gas in the abdomen may be suggestive of a gastric perforation. Contrast radiography should be performed in foals with suspected gastric outflow obstruction (emptying disorders) such as those with A B Fig. 11-28 A, Endoscopic view of ulceration of the squamous mucosa of a foal's stomach. B, Ulcerative esophagitis from gastric reflux. Note the \"cobblestone\" appearance of the mucosa. pyloric or duodenal ulceration (see . Delayed gastric emptying should be suspected if the barium is still in the stomach after two hours. Foals with ulcer disease should also have abdominal ultrasonography performed to evaluate for bowel wall thickness, ileus, and the possibility of peritoneal effusion. Ascites due to peritonitis in response to ulcers is a negative prognostic sign, and can mean perforation is imminent or has occurred.",

These drugs decrease acid secretion by competitively binding to the histamine receptor, thereby reducing stimulation of gastric acid secretion by histamine (see Table 11 -3). Suggested dosages include the following: cimetidine 20 mg/kg PO q 6 h or 6.6 mg/kg IV q 6 h; ranitidine 6.6 mg/kg PO q 8 h or 1.5 mg/kg IV q 8 h; famotidine 2.8 mg/kg PO q 12 h or 0.3 mg/kg IV q 12 h. 15 Because cimetidine is less potent, has variable absorption in horses, and is associated with inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, it may be the least preferred drug compared to the other H-2 antagonists. Intravenous or oral administration of ranitidine significantly increased intragastric pH for four and eight hours, respectively, in healthy experimental neonatal foals. 7 However, in critically ill foals, ranitidine may have a blunted duration in terms of alkalinizing response. 8 In addition, these drugs will only be beneficial when gastric pH is acidic, which may not be the case in all foals. 8 Ranitidine and sucralfate have been shown to provide partial protection against clinical, clinicopathologic, and pathologic manifestations of phenylbutazone in foals. 16 Proton pump inhibitors have been more recently added to the treatment options for gastric ulcers in horses. The most commonly used agent is omeprazole, which decreases acid production through irreversible binding to the hydrogen-potassium ATP pump of the parietal cell. Omeprazole has been studied in healthy neonatal foals. 17, 18 An oral dose of 4 mg/kg resulted in an increase in gastric pH within two hours of administration (see Table 11 -3).",

While the therapy of ulcers certainly includes pharmaceuticals to raise gastric pH, prevention of ulcers through their use is controversial. 10, 19 Some clinicians feel that alkalinizing the foal's stomach without evidence of ulceration may lead to increased survival of ingested bacteria and a risk of translocation of bacteria through the gastrointestinal mucosa. Also as stated above, the acid-secreting profile in the stomach of the critically ill foal may already be alkaline. Excellent supportive care along with intensive management of hemodynamics for the at-risk foal is at least as important to prevention of ulcers.

Additional information that is pertinent to the workup and support of the diarrheic foal include nursing ability and appetite, mentation and activity level, housing environment, and character and frequency of the diarrhea. Assessment of passive transfer of colostral antibodies is also important, as foals with failure of passive immunity are at increased risk of developing sepsis and possibly infection with pathogenic enteric organisms. On the other hand, foals with high intakes of colostrum and milk may be at increased risk for clostridial enteritis, as it has been hypothesized that colostral trypsin inhibitors may protect clostridial toxins from acid degradation in the stomach. Ingestion of large quantities of milk from heavy lactating mares may provide for additional enteral substrate for proliferation of clostridial organisms. Additional historic information centers on diet. Foals provided milk replacer or a nonequine source milk rather than mare's milk are at increased risk for development of osmotic diarrhea.

            "text": "Pica results from ingestion of sand, dirt, bedding, or hair. 4 Inflammatory or motility alterations secondary to the presence of foreign material can result in obstructions or impactions as well as diarrhea. Another dietary cause of diarrhea in the foal is dietary intolerance. It occurs when either a foal is lactoseintolerant (secondary to infectious diarrheas such as clostridiosis or rotaviral infection) or is an orphan foal with diarrhea resulting from feeding excessive amounts of milk replacer or milk replacers mixed at higher than 11% total solids. 5 Milk replacers with sucrose or maltose are particularly offensive. 5 Gastric ulcer disease is associated with diarrhea in some neonatal foals. Clinical signs can be inapparent or include bruxism, ptyalism, dorsal recumbency, diarrhea, or colic (see . Hypoxic-ischemic insult as occurs with peripartum asphyxia can result in gastrointestinal injury, leading to diarrhea. Hypoxic and subsequent reperfusion injury may both contribute to mucosal compromise. Smooth muscle and serosal dysfunction may also result. Energy depletion as occurs secondary to hypoxic-ischemic injury leads to cell membrane pump failure. Subsequent reperfusion injury leads to oxidant injury as well as inflammatory cell activation and \"no-reflow\" phenomenon. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a state of gastrointestinal necrosis that occurs from mucosal injury, as might occur with asphyxial injury, the presence of enteral nutrition, and bacterial invasion of the GI wall. Ileus, gastric reflux, abdominal distention, intestinal perforations, or diarrhea can result from NEC. 6 Prematurity is a risk factor for development of necrotizing enterocolitis. Infectious causes of diarrhea often occur in large groups of foals that are housed together; sporadic cases can also occur, particularly with clostridial agents. Viral etiologies include rotavirus and coronavirus. Rotavirus infects and denudes small intestinal microvilli, resulting in maldigestion and malabsorption. 7 It thus interferes with lactase function and sodium-glucose cotransport. Because of relative sparing of crypt epithelium, the virus also results in increased net secretion. Clinical signs vary from mild to severe diarrhea, requiring minimal to intensive therapeutic intervention, respectively. Experimentally, the incubation period is as short as two days. 7 Most affected foals are five to 35 days of age, although younger and older foals can be affected. Older foals (up to 60 days of age) usually have mild diarrhea, and asymptomatic animals can shed the virus. 7, 8 Vaccination of gravid mares may reduce the incidence of disease on farms, as well as the severity of clinical signs. 9,10 Phenolic compounds are the optimal disinfectant type used, as rotavirus is resistant to many others. Coronavirus has been associated with diarrhea in foals. 11, 12 It infects the small intestine during the first few days of life, with persistence of viral antigen in the crypt cells for three to four days after onset of diarrhea. 11 Complications of coronaviral infections can include coronitis and limb edema associated with inadequate perfusion of the extremities. 11 Other potential viral etiologies of diarrhea include adenovirus and parvovirus, although their exact role in foal diarrhea has not been clearly defined. 13 The most common bacterial causes of diarrhea include clostridial agents, especially Clostridium difficile and C. perfringens, and Salmonella. The clostridial infections can result in outbreaks or sporadic cases of diarrhea. C. difficile is a primary pathogen in neonatal foals and does not require prior antimicrobial administration as a risk factor for development of diarrhea as is usually the case with adult horses. 14, 15 The primary virulence factors for pathogenicity include two large exotoxins, toxins A (enterotoxin) and B (cytotoxin). C. difficile-associated disease ranges from mild diarrhea to highly fatal, hemorrhagic, or necrotizing diarrhea. 16 It has also been associated with lactose intolerance in foals. 14 It should be noted that toxigenic Clostridium difficile can be cultured from the feces of clinically normal foals, just as it can from healthy infants, and it is unknown what circum-stances or agent-host interactions lead to clinical disease. 17, 18 Clostridium perfringens types A and C have been reported to cause enterocolitis and diarrhea in neonatal foals. As with C. difficile, the pathogenicity of C. perfringens A and C is dependent upon virulence factors, especially the production of enterotoxins. 19 In a recent epidemiological study, C. perfringens was found in 90% of normal three-day-old foals and 64% of normal foals at eight to 12 hours of age. The most common genotype was type A (85%), and C. perfringens type C was found in less than 1% of the foals. These results suggest that type A is likely part of the normal microflora of the neonatal foal (and thus the clinical relevance of positive cultures without presence of enterotoxin are questionable), whereas Type C is rarely found in the normal neonatal and has been associated with the clinical signs of watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea, but also includes abdominal distention, colic, and ileus. 20 Therefore, typing of isolates is critical to pursuing positive cultures, because the type of C. perfringens varies between clinically normal and affected foals. Foals with C. perfringens, type C infection can develop rapidly progressive obtundation and colic and may die before the onset of diarrhea. C. perfringens-associated diarrhea is associated with a high mortality rate, 54% in one study, and is highly associated with fatal diarrhea in another study. 8, 19 Adult horses may serve as reservoirs for spores in the environment.",

Salmonella of other groups can also cause disease, for example, a group C1 Salmonella ohio has been reported to cause an outbreak of neonatal salmonellosis. 21 Mares of infected foals may be asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella and the source of the foal's infection.

It was initially believed that Cryptosporidium infections were limited to immunocompromised foals such as Arabians with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. 28 More recently, it has been identified as a pathogen of immunocompetent foals as well. 29 The organism invades the microvillus, occupying an intracellular but extracytosolic space. It thus causes villus blunting and maldigestion with a secondary osmotic diarrhea. Most affected foals are five days of age and older, but younger foals can develop disease with high-level exposure. Diarrhea usually lasts between five and 14 days, with recovering animals and asymptomatic older foals and adult horses shedding oocysts. One study identified Cryptosporidium parvum causing an outbreak of neonatal diarrhea to be genotypically identical to that associated with bovine diarrhea. 30 However, exposure to cattle was not found to be an important source of infection for foals in another epidemiologic study. 29 Sources of cryptosporidial infection in foals have not been definitively elucidated. 29 Mares, cattle, and municipal water sources have all been suspected as the source of infection in foals, but these remain speculative. 29 Because of the zoonotic risk associated with Cryptosporidium, affected foals should be handled carefully with particular attention to good hygiene.

These kits are easy and rapid, however they have variable sensitivities. Stool cytotoxin assays for toxin B are also available and are considered the gold standard for toxin testing, but are time-consuming. PCR techniques for C. difficile toxin gene sequences are currently moving from the experimental arena to the clinical setting. Diagnosis of C. perfringens enterocolitis is difficult to make. Unfortunately, immunoassays are not available for most toxins, except for enterotoxin. Therefore, cultured isolates must be typed using PCR techniques, such as the multiplex PCR. The diagnosis is made from positive cultures of toxigenic and pathogenic isolates of C. perfringens (e.g., type A or C), as well as exclusion of other pathogenic agents. Gram staining of feces can serve as a rapid screen for clostridial overgrowth, however this technique is neither sensitive nor specific (Figure 11-33) . There are a number of diagnostic tools available for diagnosis of Cryptosporidium parvum infection. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA), acid-fast (AF) staining, and flow cytometry have been developed for identification of oocysts. 29 In one study, AF and flow cytometry were determined to be more sensitive than IFA. 29 AF staining was less specific, however.

Hypoperfusion results from hypovolemia, altered myocardial contractility, inappropriate vasomotor responses, and hypooncotic states associated with hypoalbuminemia. Hemodynamic support occurs primarily in the form of intravenous fluid therapy, consisting of both crystalloids and colloids. A number of crystalloids are appropriate for foals with diarrhea, but because of the tendency for metabolic acidemia, fluids with higher strong ion differences such as Normosol R, Plasma-Lyte 148, or lactated Ringers solution are more ideal than 0.9% saline. 32 Volume replacement in the neonatal foal should be done with great attention; overzealous administration of crystalloids may potentiate gastrointestinal edema. Monitoring of central venous pressure, urine output, and serial lactate concentration measurements can aid in guiding volume replacement. Colloid therapy is indicated in the hypooncotic and hypovolemic foal. Plasma or synthetic colloid solutions, such as hetastarch, can be used. Plasma has the advantages of providing not only albumin, but also immunoglobulin, antithrombin, clotting factors, and other proteins. If hetastarch is used, platelet counts and clotting times should be monitored, as coagulopathies associated with reduced concentrations of von Willebrand's factor and factor VIII may develop. Once volume replacement has occurred and the central venous pressure (CVP) is at maximum (10 cm H 2 O), hypotension should be addressed with inotropes, such as dobutamine (2 to 20 \u03bcg/kg/minute, IV CRI). If hypotension and clinical parameters of hypoperfusion persist after initiation of inotropy, then vasopressors should be considered (norepinephrine or vasopressin CRI-see Chapter 7).",

Infectious causes include bacterial hepatitis secondary to sepsis, and infection with Actinobacillus equuli or Clostridium piliformis. Bacteremia and sepsis in general can cause hepatic dysfunction by means of inducing hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Inflammatory mediators stimulated by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) will contribute to hepatic damage. Cholangiohepatitis from enteric microbes can result from ileus, enteritis, or ulcerative duodenitis/ stricture syndrome. Bacterial hepatopathy may also occur as extension of umbilical vein phlebitis or abscessation. Hepatoencephalopathy was associated with Rhodococcus equi infection in one foal. Although not cultured, a liver biopsy suggested a bacterial etiology and the authors speculated that it may have been due to R. equi bacteremia or ascending biliary infection. 8 Tyzzer's disease, caused by Clostridium piliformis, formerly known as Bacillus piliformis, is an acute and multifocal hepatic necrosis associated with a high mortality rate. Most commonly associated with sporadic cases on farms, outbreaks of disease can also occur. Foals present with a rapidly progressive clinical course including recumbency, hyperthermia or hypothermia, and stupor or coma, icterus, and seizures with marked hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis. 9 Some foals may be found dead without preceding clinical signs.",

Foals are infected in-utero from repeated cell-associated viremia in the dam, 9 so signs are seen immediately at birth. Icterus is a common finding in neonatal herpes infections as a result of multifocal and acute hepatic necrosis. Despite profound necrosis, liver enzymes were not increased in one retrospective report. 10 In the report, herpes-positive foals were more likely to have total white blood cell counts less than 3,000/\u03bcl and to be icteric (and hyperbilirubinemic) compared to septic or premature foals. Foals with neonatal herpes infections have a poor prognosis; however, those with milder infections may survive. Treatment with acyclovir can be attempted. 11 Foals with hypoxic-ischemic injury from peripartum asphyxia most commonly exhibit clinical signs consistent with encephalopathy, nephropathy, or gastroenteropathy, however hepatopathies may also result. Such foals exhibit icterus from biliary stasis and hepatic dysfunction, and have increased concentrations of liver enzymes. Foals with neonatal isoerythrolysis sporadically develop hepatopathies with increases in direct bilirubin concentration in addition to indirect hyperbilirubinemia and increased liver enzymes. 12 Liver disease is suspected to occur as a result of tissue hypoxia, iron overload from hemolysis, or bile stasis caused by the increased amounts of conjugated bilirubin. 12 Another form of liver disease occurs secondary to gastrointestinal disease, primarily strangulating or obstructive lesions and ileus.

[18] [19] [20] Persistent hyperammonemia in Morgan horses is suspected to be similar to a syndrome of hyperornithinemia, hyperammonemia, and homocitrullinuria (HHH) in humans. 18 These foals exhibit neurologic signs including seizure activity, aimless wandering, yawning, and circling. Supportive care, lactulose, and a low-protein diet resulted in temporary clinical improvement in one of two foals that was treated, however the foal relapsed and was euthanized. 18 Glycogen-branching enzyme deficiency has been recently attributed to a mutation in the glycogen branching enzyme 1 (GBE 1) gene in Quarter Horses. 20 The syndrome has recently been termed glycogen storage disease IV and is believed to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, with clinically affected foals being homozygous for the mutation. 19, 20 Affected foals are sometimes stillborn, and otherwise exhibit flexural deformities, seizure activity, respiratory or cardiac failure, or recumbency. Leukopenia, hypoglycemia, and high serum CK, AST, and GGT concentrations were common, and all foals died by seven weeks of age. 19 The livers of affected foals contained periodic acid Schiff's (PAS)-positive intracellular inclusions and no GBE activity. An additional consideration for congenital hepatic disease is hepatoblastoma. 21 Polycythemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and increased liver enzymes occur with this liver neoplasm. 21 These foals may survive to weaning or adulthood, but hepatoblastoma has been reported in an aborted fetus and may thus be congenital. 22 Toxic hepatopathies have been reported in neonatal foals following administration of oral pastes contain-ing ferrous sulfate in the first one to two days of life. 23 Experimental administration of iron to foals confirmed that the hepatotoxicity from the oral paste was indeed due to the contained iron. 23, 24 Pathologic changes included liver atrophy, bile duct hyperplasia, lobular necrosis, cholestasis, and periportal fibrosis. Druginduced hepatopathies can also occur during this time period because of relatively immature hepatic function and increased absorption of macromolecules during colostral IgG absorption. 12 Oral medications should be used with caution in foals less than 24 hours of age because of the potential for increased bioavailability with subsequent hepatotoxicity. Other potential hepatotoxins reported in horses include aflatoxins, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, leukoencephalomalacia, and chlorinated hydrocarbons, although these are considered unlikely in the young foal because of lack of ingestion of feedstuffs by neonates. Steroid hepatopathy has been reported in three-and 10-year-old horses, secondary to intramuscular administration of high doses of triamcinolone acetonide in both cases. 25, 26 (Figure  11-36) .",

            "text": "Hyperammonemia is often present, also reflecting liver dysfunction. The liver is the primary site of ammonia removal by converting it to urea for renal excretion. Foals with portacaval shunts commonly have high resting ammonia concentrations. Morgan foals with HHH syndrome have very high concentrations of blood ammonia (>200 \u03bcmol/liter), while liver enzymes are only mildly to moderately increased and bilirubin is normal to mildly elevated. Proper handling procedures are critical to accurate measurement and interpretation of blood ammonia. 28 Heparinized blood should be used, and the sample should be collected gently (to avoid hemolysis) and kept on ice. The sample should be run within one hour of collection or otherwise spun in order to freeze the plasma at \u221220\u00b0C for subsequent measurement within 48 hours. Blood from aged-matched control foals should be run concurrently. 28 Additional biochemical indicators of liver function include serum glucose, BUN, albumin, and cholesterol concentrations. Glucose concentrations are variable, and reflect the degree of hepatic necrosis and milk intake. Foals with severe hepatitis or necrosis, such as those with Tyzzer's disease, have profound hypoglycemia. Those with portacaval shunts also commonly exhibit hypoglycemia. As BUN, albumin, and cholesterol are synthesized by the liver, dysfunction is reflected by reduced concentrations of these analytes. However, hypoalbuminemia is uncommon with liver disease, as only 18% and 6% of horses with chronic and acute liver disease had albumin concentrations below the reference value in one report. 29 It has been estimated that greater than 80% of liver mass must be lost for longer than three weeks before hypoalbuminemia develops. 30 Fractionation of blood amino acids and determination of the branch chain amino acid (BCAA) to aromatic amino acid (AAA) ratio can aid in determining hepatic function. Decreases in the ratio indicate insufficiency, with normal ratios falling between 3.5 and 4.5. 30 Because of liver dysfunction and reduced conversion of blood ammonia to BUN, a decrease in BUN concentration is often observed. It should be noted, however, that BUN concentrations in the normal neonatal foal are lower than those in the adult horse and low concentrations are therefore difficult to interpret in the neonatal liver patient.",

Clearance and half-life reflect hepatic excretory function and are prolonged in animals with biliary obstruction or hepatocellular failure. It should be noted that alterations in hepatic blood flow alter interpretation of BSP clearance; significant decreases in blood flow as occurs with portosystemic shunts will reduce the delivery of BSP and hence cause an increase in halflife. High bilirubin and low albumin concentrations will result in increased and decreased BSP half-life, respectively. Quantification of serum bile acids has largely replaced the use of BSP clearance as an indicator of hepatic function in horses. 30 The concentration of triglycerides may increase in foals with liver disease because of reduced hepatic clearance and increased mobilization from adipose tissue associated with a catabolic state. Cholesterol and VLDL concentrations may decrease, however, because of reduced hepatic synthesis. It should again be noted that triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations are higher in healthy neonatal foals compared to adults, and vary with age. 27 In one report, foals had concentrations of 24 to 88 and 30 to 193 mg/dl for triglycerides in <12-hour and in one-day-old foals, respectively. Cholesterol concentrations were 111 to 432 and 110 to 562 in those same age groups. 27 CBC findings are dependent upon the cause of liver disease. Leukocytosis may be present with cholangiohepatitis.

Striking hypoglycemia should be a clue to the presence of infection with Clostridium piliformis. These foals often have a metabolic acidosis, with hyperlactatemia due to increased production (hypoperfusion, inflammation, catecholamine surges) and reduced hepatic clearance. Complete blood counts often reveal leukopenia with a left shift and cytologic evidence of toxicity, although leukocytosis is present in some cases. 32 Hemoconcentration reflects hypovolemia and dehydration. Hyperfibrinogenemia is common. Physical examination is consistent with septic shock, with petechial hemorrhages and injection being common. Hypovolemic shock is also evident. Mentation is usually depressed, ranging from lethargy to comatose, and icterus is a prominent finding. Clinical signs of hepatoencephalopathy may include depression, weakness, and seizures. Diarrhea is an inconsistent finding. Fever is usually present, although hypothermia from shock may be predominating when initially examined. 32 Affected foals are often found dead.

Foals with acute hepatopathies often present in hypovolemic crises. A combination of crystalloids and colloids is indicated in volume replacement. Ideal crystalloids for liver disease include those containing acetate and/or gluconate instead of lactate, such as Plasma-Lyte 148 or Normosol-R (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). The liver is the primary site of lactate clearance, whereas muscle and renal metabolize acetate and gluconate is utilized by most tissues. Though accumulation of lactate from LRS does not lead to lactic acidosis (the cation associated with lactate in LRS is sodium as opposed to hydrogen ion), lactate is depressive to the myocardium; therefore iatrogenic increases in lactate concentration should be avoided. Foals with septic shock, such as those with Tyzzer's disease, should be treated with aggressive fluid therapy. Boluses of 10 to 20 ml/kg of isotonic replacement crystalloids or 3 to 5 ml/kg of colloids should be administered over 20 to 30 minutes until the hypovolemic crisis is improved or fails to improve with further volume.",
