It is expected to drive system changes in terms of new formal and informal institutional and organisational arrangements. This study, using Rift Valley fever (RVF) as a zoonotic problem requiring an OH approach, sought to understand the institutionalisation process at national and subnational levels in an early adopting country, Kenya. Materials and methods: Social network analysis methodologies were used. Stakeholder roles and relational data were collected at national and subnational levels in 2012. Key informants from stakeholder organisations were interviewed, guided by a checklist. Public sector animal and public health organisations were interviewed first to identify other stakeholders with whom they had financial, information sharing and joint cooperation relationships. Visualisation of the OH social network and relationships were shown in sociograms and mathematical (degree and centrality) characteristics of the network summarised. Results and discussion: Thirty-two and 20 stakeholders relevant to OH were identified at national and subnational levels, respectively. Their roles spanned wildlife, livestock, and public health sectors as well as weather prediction. About 50% of national-level stakeholders had made significant progress on OH institutionalisation to an extent that formal coordination structures (zoonoses disease unit and a technical working group) had been created. However, the process had not trickled down to subnational levels although cross-sectoral and sectoral collaborations were identified. The overall binary social network density for the stakeholders showed that 35 and 21% of the possible ties between the RVF and OH stakeholders existed at national and subnational levels, respectively, while public health actors' collaborations were identified at community/grassroots level. We recommend extending the OH network to include the other 50% stakeholders and fostering of the process at subnational-level building on available cross-sectoral platforms.",

Zoonoses account for 70% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and 60% of human pathogens/ diseases (2\u00c14). About 80% of human infectious disease pathogens could be used for bioterrorism (5) . Major zoonotic EIDs that have occurred over the last 20 years include bovine spongiform encephalopathy, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), severe acute respiratory syndrome (6) , Hendra virus disease (7), Nipah virus encephalitis (8) , West Nile fever (9) , pandemic H1N1 influenza (10) , Middle East respiratory syndrome (11) and Ebola (12) . Apart from the EIDs, endemic zoonoses such as Rift Valley fever (RVF) are also of great concern.",

On the other hand, SNA provides insights into social diffusion and adoption of innovations and coalition formation (27) . We consider all actors within OH as stakeholders and thus use the terms interchangeably. Figure 1 shows this study's schematised five-component conceptual framework for OH institutionalisation adapted from Ref. (26) which would be required to initiate and institutionalise OH. The SNA widely used to study social networks of stakeholders was therefore the key analytical method of the central component. In OH adoption, stakeholders would not only initiate multisectoral cooperation on crosssectoral health issues but also organise and hold in place activities of the other four components (mobilisation, social acceptance, alliance building, and institutionalisation). In doing so, they are guided by policy and legal frameworks. In the absence of appropriate policies, the stakeholders can also influence policy and legal frameworks. Mobilisation, a dynamic interplay between evidence and arguments (26) , would shape and define how OH actions and solutions are framed. Stakeholders' current perceptions and the provided evidence would influence the actions and solutions. OH policy works if key stakeholders gather cross-sectoral allies (and their resources) to join a network based on empirical evidence and benefits associated with change. However, the evidence is a cultural construct. Although there are scientific principles across nations, there might be a strong cultural influence on what is acceptable as evidence. Often, stakeholders may focus on a common problem that requires OH approach. Social acceptance process requires buy-in by governments and other actors. Institutionalisation refers to the process by which authoritative acceptance and institutional support emerges with appropriate governance structures (e.g. professional associations and issue-specific government units or committees) and financing and development of appropriate policy frameworks.",

Three relationships were considered: financial resources flows, cooperation (joint planning and implementation), and information sharing. Strengths of the three relationships were measured by asking respondents to assign individual qualitative scores using grouped ordinal and interval approaches. They were asked to describe frequency (as high, medium, low, or not applicable) and intensity (as high, medium, low, or not applicable) of the relationships and based on both, they scored each as either non-existent, weak, medium, strong, or very strong. Often, as noted in (29) , respondents experienced difficulties scoring each relation independently and were allowed to collapse the three and use one score instead. To construct some true interval-level measure, we converted the qualitative scores into quantitative values using a scale of 0\u00c18 as in no linkage (0), weak (1 or 2), medium (3 or 4), strong (5 or 6), and very strong (7 or 8). The decision to assign a lower or higher score for, let us say, medium was based on described frequency and intensity of interactions. The approach to an extent balanced the predispositions of the researcher and the respondent's descriptions, whereas the continuous measure of the relationships allowed estimation of statistical measures. The quantitative scores were plotted in a matrix. UCINET software (30) generated SNA sociograms and statistical measures (density, clustering coefficients, degree of closeness, and between-ness) of relationship strength. The statistical measures were estimated to understand the extent of relationships, and stakeholder power and influence within the OH network. Centrality statistics of actor degree, closeness (or farness), and between-ness reflect power and influence within the network. Degree measures describe the way an actor is embedded in a network while closeness refers to how close they are to others. High in-degree values for a stakeholder reflect a position where others want to influence it, for example, through information sharing. High out-degree measure for a stakeholder reflects a position of where it wants to influence those linked to them. Between-ness refers to a position of an actor in a network as in between several pairs of actors, or no other actors lie between them and other actors. The degree of clustering (cluster coefficient) of stakeholders in a network is estimated as an average of all the neighbourhoods.",

OH was conceptualised as policy or innovation where stakeholders (who needed to cooperate to resolve a cross-sectoral problem) with diverse roles and networks were a central component. The stakeholders and their networks would require undertaking activities towards mobilisation, alliance building, social acceptance, and institutionalisation of OH. The study applied SNA methods namely snowballing, sociograms and statistical measurements of relationships to generate information on the OH stakeholders in Kenya, their cross-sectoral relationships and the extent to which they had institutionalised OH. To focus the analysis, a specific crosssectoral health problem, RVF, was identified. The SNA snowball method facilitated mapping of 32 and 21 public and private RVF and OH stakeholders at national and subnational levels, respectively, drawn from animal and public health sectors and climate prediction agencies. Each stakeholder played a unique role and therefore we considered all as critical for cross-sectoral collaboration. Identification of climate prediction agencies at national level and a cross-sectoral steering group (DSG) of the ALRMP at subnational show that cross-sectoral collaborations for zoonotic diseases may go beyond the two health sectors. Sociogram for the subnational stakeholders revealed a denser network among the public health stakeholders, which was attributed to more stakeholders and existence of within-sector multilevel coordination platforms. Network density measures showed that a significant number of relationships were missing at both levels but more at subnational level. These together with the limited efforts to institutionalise OH at subnational despite policy support can be attributed to failure to establish cooperation platforms among livestock sector stakeholders and between them, the community and public health sectors. Considering this happens at a level close to communities and where RVF outbreaks or other zoonotic events occur, then, concerted OH actions focused on solving a problem at animal level would be challenging.",

However, the impacts of missed opportunity to bring all (and their resources) on board might be evident when major disease events occur.",

For example, ALRMP (and its DSG and HSG) emerged as a stakeholder who connected most subnational stakeholders and whom also many stakeholders sought to influence. This implies that platforms with cross-sectoral mandate and coordination are critical in OH networks. The centrality measures findings show that cross-sectoral mandate and coordination is critical in networks. At both levels, high ties (in and out) of the MOH and DVS can be attributed to their legal mandate to implement prevention and control of diseases, which made other stakeholders want to exert their influence on them. On the other hand, high ties of CDC, WHO, and FAO reflect their global mandates in OH and their networks. These five organisations (CDC, WHO, FAO, MOH, and DVS) can be said to enjoy an advantage of having alternative ways to access resources and are able to call on more resources if needed, evidenced by them rallying others around ZTWG and ZDU. The presence of regional and international communities seem to have offered an opportunity for the top-down OH mobilisation as well as the link between local OH initiatives with global OH and regional platforms/networks. Through support from these organisations, the country had made direct and indirect links with major global and regional networks.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the need to institutionalise OH at subnational level is emphasised particularly in order to address the low networking between animal and public health sector who are considered as the critical drivers of OH. Also, the national OH can be strengthened to pull more resources. To do so, this study recommends the following: OH regional coordination. The activities of the regional OH platform would then finally be linked to national OH platforms which in turn would be linked to subnational networks. Further, we note that the data collection and analysis methodologies used had limitations. First, the strength of relationships, though based on frequency and intensity of relationships, were subjective and could have introduced respondent bias. Secondly, the approach to convert ordinal to interval data could have also introduced author bias. Thirdly, inherent to SNA methods, binarising the relationship strength data leads to inform loss. Fourth, the data were collected in a cross-sectional survey. It would have been good to show interval sociograms. However, SNA proved useful in mapping the stakeholders, visualising the network, and generating mathematical properties of the network, which may not have been archived by other approaches of stakeholder mapping. Lastly, the information generated provides a baseline for future analysis of the impacts of the OH institutionalisation in the country and generation of temporal sociograms.",
