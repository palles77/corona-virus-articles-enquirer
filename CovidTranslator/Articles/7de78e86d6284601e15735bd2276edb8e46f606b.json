Upon creating a shuffled S1 gene library, we randomly selected 25 clones and analyzed them by DNA sequencing. In total, eleven clones contained novel S1 gene recombinants. Based on sequence data, each recombinant was unique and contained a fulllength open reading frame. The average number of crossovers per recombinant was 5 and the average number of point mutations was 1.3, leading mostly to non-synonymous amino acid changes. No recombinant contained sequences from all four parental genes and no recombinant contained any sequence from the distantly related Delaware 072 strain. Our data suggests that recombination between distantly related IBV strains within the S1 gene probably does not readily occur. This finding is extremely important in light of the common industry vaccination practice of mixing different live-attenuated IBV strains.",

Although commercial poultry flocks are routinely vaccinated for IBV, outbreaks of infectious bronchitis still happen due to naturally occuring variant viruses that continue to arise. Currently, modified live and killed viruses that do not cross protect are used to vaccinate chickens. Better vaccines that are low in virulence, highly immunogenic and most importantly, cross protective between different IBV strains/serotypes are needed. To create better vaccines, a strategy that keeps pace with the rate of viral change in nature is needed.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus is a Coronavirus that contains a large, single stranded, positive sense RNA genome that is 27.5 kb long. The genome encodes four major structural proteins: the membrane glycoprotein, the envelope protein, the nucleocapsid protein, and the spike glycoprotein, which contains conformationaly dependent virusneutralizing and serotype specific epitopes [1] . Unfortunately, the three-dimensional structure of the spike is not known and development of an efficacious recombinant vaccine has not been successful. The ability of IBV to rapidly change in nature is attributable to its method of replication. Infectious bronchitis virus undergoes genetic drift due to point mutations that occur during replication because the viral polymerase lacks proofreading ability. In addition, genetic shift occurs due to the recombination of two or more strains during replication. Both genetic drift and shift have been documented for IBV in the laboratory and in birds [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

Basically, genes (parental) with some level of similarity are recombined in a test tube by any number of techniques, such that the newly created genes contain genetic information from some or all of the parental genes. The new recombinant genes can be expressed as protein and then selected or screened for a desired property. Within the last 10 years, researchers have used DNA shuffling to create new genes that encode novel or improved proteins [8] [9] [10] [11] . As an example, Zhao et al. developed the Staggered Extension Process or StEP to shuffle different sequences encoding the subtilisin E protein and improved its half-life at 65\u00b0C by 50-fold [12] . Briefly, they promoted recombination by using a modified polymerase chain reaction in which the annealing and extension steps were combined and allowed only brief periods of time for polymerization.",

Lowering the temperature should increase the chance for recombination by slowing down the DNA polymerase and allowing for less similar sequences to hybridize, while decreasing the annealing/extension time would produce shorter fragments during each PCR cycle. Those changes should increase the number of unique recombinants, and might produce recombinants that contain sequences from all of the parental genes.",

            "text": "It was interesting to note that there was very little Arkansas DPI sequence and no Delaware 072 sequence in the recombinant genes. This may be due to the lower level of similarity between these two parental genes as compared to the Massachusetts 41 and Connecticut 46 S1 genes ( Table 1) . In fact, it may be impossible to recombine the Delaware 072 gene by the StEP because its S1 gene nucleotide similarity to the Massachusetts 41, Conneticut 46, and Arkansas DPI strains is extremely low (52.3%, 50.7%, and 48.7%, respectively). It is difficult to shuffle genes by the StEP with similarities below 70% (F.H. Arnold, California Institute of Technology, personal communication). Creating novel IBV S1 genes Previous research indicates that most natural recombination of infectious bronchitis viruses occurs in hot spots termed intergenic consensus sequences [5] . These areas are regions of similarity outside of the coding sequence for a gene. This normally leads to recombination of whole genes, not sections of genes, although some exceptions have been reported [2, 3] . Our research has shown that even under near ideal conditions for recombination, recombinants from very different sequences within the S1 gene could not be produced. The Delaware 072 virus is unique in that it is less than 60% similar in the S1 gene to all other IBV isolates. Thus, it would seem logical to assume that natural Delaware 072 recombinants containing crossovers within the S1 gene coding sequence with other IBV types would be rare. Indeed, a recent report details a new serotype of IBV, designated GA98, which appears to have evolved from the Delaware 072 strain by antigenic drift and not by antigenic shift [6] . It appears that recombination at intergenic consensus regions, which replaces whole genes in IBV, is more likely to occur when the S1 genes of two strains are less than 70-75%, whereas antigenic shift could occur to produce variants within the S1 gene from the recombination of IBV strains with a S1 gene similarity above 70-75%. This finding is extremely important in light of the common practice of simultaneously vaccinating with different live attenuated strains of IBV to achieve broad protection in commercial chicken flocks. However, these percentages have been determined from our data and should be considered an estimation only, because in vivo RNA recombination for IBV may differ from the in vitro DNA recombination reported here.",

The relatively low S1 amino acid sequence similarity for the DS-2 and DS-16 clones to any of the parental clones suggests that they may induce unique antibodies and makes them good candidates for further serologic characterization. Interestingly, the crossover sites for DS-2 ensure that different parental sequences reside within regions known to play key roles in the formation of virus neutralizing epitopes [19] [20] [21] 25] .",
