As of February 25, 2020, China has accumulated more than 70,000 confirmed cases of Novel coronavirus pneumonia(NCP), which have been reported internationally in 24 countries and 5 continents [4]. The timely conduct of clinical drug research and the promotion of clinical trial information sharing are critical to epidemic prevention and control.In May 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially launched the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). In July 2007, The ChiCTR was officially certified by the ICTRP as a first-level registrar, becoming the fourth primary registrar after the Australian/New Zealand Center, the American Center, and the British Center [5]. According to the Declaration of Helsinki and the regulations of National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), all medical research conducted in China must be registered in ChiCTR [6]. As of February 24, 2020, the ChiCTR Center has registered more than 200 COVID-19 clinical studies. It is of great significance to discuss the research status and development situation in this field in time, which is effective for conducting clinical research and accelerating the transformation of results.",

Chloroquine phosphate may have clinical therapeutic value.Mesenchymal stem cells are the most frequently studied in immunotherapy (n=10).Immune abnormalities are the main reason for the progression of patients with severe new-type coronavirus pneumonia. MSC can regulate both the innate immune system and the acquired immune system, and has become the most promising treatment for immune disorders[24,25].MSC can regulate inflammation through a series of mechanisms, including inhibiting T cell hyperproliferation, inducing CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cell (Tregs) subsets, and also inhibiting B cell hyperproliferation, differentiation, and immunoglobulin production[26]. At the same time, it can also regulate the secretion of major inflammatory factors and anti-inflammatory factors[27].Immunotherapy of MSC may have clinical therapeutic value.",

The rapid implementation of BEI intervention strategies in the early stages of the epidemic can effectively control the spread of the epidemic[32-35].
