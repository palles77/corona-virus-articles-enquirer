Methods: We studied 489 smear-positive adult TB patients and 305 household contact controls without TB with nasopharyngeal swab samples within an ongoing prospective cohort study in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, between 2013 and 2015. We used multiplex real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses and seven bacterial pathogens from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: The median age of the study participants was 33 years; 61% (484/794) were men, and 21% (168/ 794) were HIV-positive. TB patients had a higher prevalence of HIV (28.6%; 140/489) than controls (9.2%; 28/305). Overall prevalence of respiratory viral pathogens was 20.4% (160/794; 95%CI 17.7e23.3%) and of bacterial pathogens 38.2% (303/794; 95%CI 34.9e41.6%). TB patients and controls did not differ in the prevalence of respiratory viruses (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.00, 95%CI 0.71e1.44), but respiratory bacteria were less frequently detected in TB patients (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.53e0.94). TB patients with both respiratory viruses and respiratory bacteria were likely to have more severe disease (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.6, 95%CI 1.",

The efforts towards understanding other risk factors in TBdsuch as respiratory viruses, helminths [6] , and bacteria [7] dare becoming increasingly important [8] . Evidence from experimental mouse models suggests that respiratory viruses such as influenza viruses may play a pathogenic role in individuals with tuberculous disease by negatively affecting immunity against M. tuberculosis [9] . The effect of respiratory viruses on TB may mimic the development of bacterial pneumonia immediately after an infection with respiratory viruses [10] . Studies of the lung microbiota (the community of microorganisms in the airways), which have focused on respiratory bacterial populations, suggest that there are differences in respiratory bacterial species populations among patients with and without TB, among new and recurrent TB patients, as well as among those in whom TB treatment has failed [7] .",

Logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and HIV infection were used to assess the associations between respiratory pathogens and clinical presentations of TB at the time of recruitment among TB patients, with the following outcome variables: severe TB score (score of 6) versus mild (score of 1e5), high sputum bacterial load (sputum AFB smear microscopy of 2\u00fe) versus low bacterial load, and presence versus absence of lung infiltrations and cavitations (chest x-ray findings). Associations were expressed as crude odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted ORs (aORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).

We detected respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal swabs using a highly sensitive and specific molecular technique [21] , whereas the study from Indonesia [20] measured influenza virus antibody titres which also detect patients with previous exposure to influenza viruses.

Direct evidence of clinical effects of respiratory viruses on TB have only been demonstrated in experimental mouse models that have exhibited higher mycobacterial loads in the lungs and increased lung inflammation [9] . The immunological pathway responsible for more severe clinical presentation in TB patients may occur either via the type I interferon-receptordependent pathway [9] or via decreased MHC II expression on dendritic cells [23] , which may result in poor clearance of M. tuberculosis from the lungs. We found smoking and living in a household with three or more persons to be risk factors for respiratory viruses. Smoking has been shown, at least in animal models, to inhibit the pulmonary T-cell response to influenza viruses, thus increasing susceptibility to infection [24] , and respiratory viruses were more likely to be detected in children living with a smoker [25] . In addition, overcrowdingdwhich we defined as three or more persons in a householddis a common risk factor for most airborne pathogens such as M. tuberculosis [26] and respiratory viruses [22] .",

Overall respiratory bacterial load was smaller in TB patients than in controls. This is similar to findings from a microbiota study which reported smaller bacterial loads in TB patients than in controls [27] . The authors argue that the initial phase of M. tuberculosis invasion in the lungs may prompt an immune response that could also reduce the commensal flora in the lower respiratory tract [27] . Interestingly, in a mouse model, M. tuberculosis infection in the lungs appeared also to have an effect on the gut microbiota, which is part of the collective human microbiota [28] . These findings consistently suggest interactions between M. tuberculosis and the communities of microorganisms, and a role for these interactions in TB pathogenesis.",

A limitation of the study is its undifferentiated attention to respiratory viruses because of small numbers which precluded assessment of the clinical effects of individual viruses. However, we presume that all respiratory viruses have similar levels of immunomodulation, and thus we could combine all respiratory viruses together.",
