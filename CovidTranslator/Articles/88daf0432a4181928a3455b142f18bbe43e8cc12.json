This focus permits a view of medical provision as a (quasi-) consumer good, whose distribution can be or should be contingent on individual choice. The approach cannot be extended to public health provision. Public health provision, including measures for limiting the spread of infectious diseases, is a public good and can be provided for some only if provided for many. The provision or nonprovision of public goods cannot be contingent on individual informed consent, so must be in some respects compulsory. An adequate ethics of public health needs to set aside debates about informed consent and to consider the permissible limits of just compulsion for various types of public good. It will therefore gain more from engaging with work in political philosophy than with individualistic work in ethics.",

One conspicuous change has been a steadily increasing focus on informed consent, which is now usually taken to be essential for any ethically acceptable medical practice. The literature on informed consent in medical ethics is vast and repetitive. However, it has significant limitations. Some of the difficulties are well known and recalcitrant, although this seldom dents the enthusiasm of those who think informed consent essential to (or even sufficient for) ethically acceptable medical practice. In this paper I shall mention the commonly discussed difficulties, but shall concentrate on some less discussed but philosophically deeper difficulties that limit the use to which informed consent procedures can be put in public health provision.",

If they cannot understand the proposition to which their consent is sought, they cannot give or refuse informed consent. The hard cases are numerous and intractable. Many patients cannot consent to medical intervention or treatment because they are too young, too ill, too disabled or too demented to understand the information that they would have to grasp to make an informed choice. As they can hardly be denied medical treatment because of these difficulties, it must be given without their consent. Should it then be given on the basis of others' consent (e.g. that of parents, guardians or relatives)? Or does the very idea of proxy consent undermine the fundamental concerns that are taken to justify informed consent requirements, or even show disrespect for individuals or their autonomy? Should proxy consent perhaps be set aside as mere pretence and replaced with greater reliance on professional judgement of each patient's best interests? Or would doing so revert to unacceptable medical paternalism, and so fail to respect patients and their (faltering) autonomy? Responses to these questions often propose ways of revising or refining the procedures used for requesting and recording consent to make consenting easier for less competent patients. But even the most energetic and timeconsuming presentation of user-friendly information, even the most elaborate and detailed consent forms and procedures, will not make informed consent possible for numerous patients with various types of incapacity.",

Informed consent procedures are problematic not merely because their philosophical rationale is disputed, and not merely because some individuals lack competence to consent, or lack it at some times. The most basic philosophical difficulties with informed consent arise because consent is a propositional attitude. Consenting-like other cognitive states or acts such as knowing, believing, understanding, hoping, wondering, thinking, desiring or fearing-takes a proposition as its object. Hence consent is never directed at a medical intervention as such, but rather at some proposition that describes an intended intervention. However, any intervention can be described in many different ways. Even in the easy cases, where competent patients consent to a procedure or treatment described in a certain way, they may not be aware of and may not consent to other true descriptions of the same intervention, or of its more obvious effects. This can be the case even when the second description is entailed by the first, or when it refers to an obvious consequence of the state of affairs described by the first.",

It would be possible-but strenuous-to introduce explicit consent procedures for the most minor and routine of medical Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004) interventions. However much we introduce additional explicit procedures and consent forms for interventions that are now performed on the basis of implied consent, explicit consent always relies on background understandings that remain implicit. The longest and most complex consent form cannot include a complete description of everything that will be done. Much is taken as understood, and consent based on those understandings can only be implied. No programme for replacing implied with explicit consent can be complete.",

The problem is not merely that in the past consent procedures were too lax, and that the relevant consents were not obtained, or not recorded with sufficient clarity (although that was often the case). The problem is deeper, indeed irresolvable, because many valuable purposes could not have been anticipated at the time that tissues were removed and stored. For example, nobody could tell in advance when information and tissues obtained in the course of treating past patients will turn out to be useful for unanticipated research. Both clinical information and tissue samples pertaining to deceased patients may later turn out to be vital for reaching a better understanding of new diseases. When the first patients with vCJD died, the only way in which pathologists could determine whether this was a new disease was by comparing their brain tissue with samples taken from patients who had died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease across many decades in many countries. Tissue and information from those who died in the 1918 influenza epidemic may yet prove valuable in studying emerging diseases (Gamblin et al. 2004 ). It is difficult to see how secondary data analysis of this sort can proceed if access to tissue samples from and data pertaining to past patients, their treatment and their clinical outcomes, cannot be consulted without specific prior consent to such studies. Although the incidence of disease could be monitored on the basis of collecting deidentified data, linked data are needed for all more elaborate forms of retrospective study and public health research. Specific consent requirements undermine secondary data analysis in medical and other areas of inquiry; they would close down epidemiology.",

One of the most significant is that informed consent procedures are inapplicable whenever the goods or benefits to be provided are public goods. Certain types of goods-consumer goods, clinical care-can be provided for individuals, and their provision can in principle be made to be contingent on individual consent. The difficulties that informed consent requirements raise may prove irresolvable in some cases and resolvable in others. By contrast, if public goods are provided for any, they have to be provided for many. Some types of public good must be provided (or not provided) for whole populations; others may be provided (or not provided) for more restricted groups. For present purposes I leave these differences aside, to make the simple point that the provision of public goods cannot be made contingent on individual consent. For example, road safety, food safety, water safety, safe medicines and measures that protect against infection cannot be tailored to individual choice. Because there are no obligations to do the impossible ('ought implies can'), informed consent cannot be ethically required for the provision of public goods.",

The public provision of health care can reflect democratic process, and thereby certain forms of collective choice; but its basic structures cannot be geared to individual choice.

This theory is John Stuart Mill's form of liberalism, especially as developed in On liberty. I choose Mill's account of justice not because I assume or argue that it is more plausible than other accounts, but because he explicitly opposes compulsion except in very limited circumstances. Mill famously claimed that \u2026the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of any of their number is self-protection. (Mill 1989, ch. 1, p. 13) Compulsion, on this view, is permitted only where needed so as to protect others: it is unjust unless needed to prevent harm to others. Public health provision is an obvious area where Mill's arguments are relevant, because compulsion may be needed to prevent individual action that might harm others' health.",

Depending on the gravity of the risk, it might be permissible to institute mandatory monitoring of those who may have been exposed, mandatory vaccination (if a vaccine is developed), restrictions on free movement, or quarantine. Similarly, where vaccination is safe and effective, Mill's argument would suggest that it could legitimately be made compulsory to produce the herd immunity that protects vulnerable individuals who cannot (yet) be vaccinated. Making public health measures such as these compulsory would hardly have seemed controversial a century ago. It has come to seem controversial on the basis of an illusory assumption that all medical provision, and with it public health provision, can be organized on the basis of informed consent of individuals.
