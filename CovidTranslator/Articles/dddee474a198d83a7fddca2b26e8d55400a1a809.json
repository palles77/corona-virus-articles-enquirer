            "text": "Background. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is straining health systems around the world. Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions. Methods. We employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic. We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions. Results and Conclusions. The analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs. The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged out of the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December, 2019 [15, 31, 71, 46, 41, 66, 53, 16] , is now straining or overwhelming health care systems around the world [1] . As of March 2020, hundreds of new confirmed cases have been reported daily in multiple countries of every continent 1 [54, 51, 59, 35, 30] [13, 17, 39] while the global death toll has passed 13,000. To combat the spread of the virus, in the absence of a vaccine or specific treatments, an increasing number of nations are putting in place social distancing interventions ranging from school closures, quarantine orders on segments of the population, and banning large public gatherings. In order to devise effective control strategies at different spatial scales, it is critical to have a clear understanding of transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2, including local human-to-human transmission dynamics [31, 12, 49, 46, 37] as well as long-range transmission events (countryto-country) [65] . To characterize the origin, geographic extent and epidemiological parameters of the epidemic, phylogenetics and phylodynamics inference tools have proved useful during this and past epidemic emergencies [68, 69, 38, 61, 10, 63, 11, 10, 5, 48, 70, 42, 60, 67, 19] . However, previous studies indicate that methods based on genetic networks are more powerful and efficient to identify transmission patterns and ascertain transmission links compared to methods based on binary phylogenies [62] .",

Here we sought to characterize the transmission pathways that facilitated the virus to establish itself as a pandemic. Such analyses rely on viral genomic data that continues to accumulate in near real time as next-generation sequencing technologies are now more widely used. The richness and accessibility of the genomic data distinguishes this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic from previous large-scale epidemics or pandemics including the 2009/AH1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2003 SARS outbreaks. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of this emerging virus spreading in an essentially naive population. Another feature of the scope of the genomic data for COVID-19 is the high sampling density available to investigate the early transmission stages. Indeed, although the virus genetic diversity gradually increases as the virus spreads, particular genomic variants have been repeatedly sequenced at different time points and geographical locations. This indicates that the available sequencing data cover a significant part of the evolutionary space explored from the onset of the epidemics. In this setting, viral evolution could be accurately modeled, reconstructed and visualized by genetic networks models [8, 52] , which have been successfully used for the analysis of different viral epidemics [52, 62, 9] . However, in emerging outbreak settings, when all circulating viral genomes are relatively close to each other, methods that allow the analysis of viral population structures at finer resolution than provided by state-of-the-art network models are needed. We achieve such resolution by using mutation trees [34] (related to character-based phylogenies [24] ) that keep track of the accumulation of mutations in viral populations. Moreover, as the SARS-CoV-2 population contain relatively few 4-gamete rule violations, it is feasible to efficiently generate and analyze all plausible mutation trees. These trees, in turn, allow for accurate inferences of transmission networks.",

Next, genomic positions without variation have been removed, leaving m = 274 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) for further analysis. Finally, the alignment was represented by the n \u00d7 m (0, 1)-mutation matrix M with rows corresponding to sequences and columns corresponding to SNVs, where M i,j = 1 whenever the i-th genome has a minor allele at the position j with respect to the reference.",

Therefore, we are looking for the the minimum vertex cover of G 4g , i.e. the minimum number of vertices in G 4g whose removal destroys all edges in G 4g . The set of genomic positions corresponding to vertices in the minimum vertex cover of G 4g forms the most parsimonious set of mutations that should be repeated. We find all minimal vertex covers using Bron-Kerbosch algorithm [6] for maximum independent sets generation; this approach uses the fact that complements of maximum independent sets are exactly minimum vertex covers.

The fact that this correlation is not absolutely perfect is not surprising, as sampling times are much more prone to different sampling and reporting biases and may not accurately reflect actual transmission times. Even in such settings, for 86.10% of potential transmission pairs, their sampling times agree with each other, i.e. the potential source was sampled earlier than the potential recipient; and for 94.25% of these pairs their sampling times either agree or differ by up to 7 days.

Following [62, 29] , we fitted the following distributions to the observed degree distribution of the transmission network: negative binomial, Yule, Pareto and Waring. To compare the goodness of fit yielded by different models, we used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) ( Table 1) . The Pareto distribution, that represent the classical power-law demonstrated the best fit. The exponent of the Pareto distribution was estimated to be 1.20 (95%CI = [1.12, 1.34), indicating the higher tendency of vertices to be connected to hubs (high-degree vertices).",

In particular, the state of California alone could have exhibited multiple introductions with no identified significant clustering of cases, as its observed viral haplotypes were either also sampled in China (2 cases) or linked directly to the haplotypes in mainland China (2 cases, p e = 1), or to haplotypes from Singapore, Vietnam, Australia and Canada (4 cases, p e = 0.98, 0.97, 0.99 and 1, respectively) which are, in turn, linked to haplotypes sampled in mainland China (p e = 0.98, 0.77, 1 and 1). In contrast, the haplotypes from the state of Washington form a connected subtree and thus suggest a single introduction from mainland China (since the root of the Washington subtree was also sampled in China) followed by the sustainable human-to-human transmissions inside the state (mean p e = 0.99). In addition, the network suggests independent introductions to Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New York, Illinois and Arizona. So far, two possible cases of virus transmission between US states could be identified: from Arizona to Texas (p e = 0.83) and from Washington to California (p e = 1). Finally, as expected, the sequences from the Grand Princess cruise ship could be linked to a single case identical to the Wuhan-1 haplotype.",

This potential transmission route is in agreement with epidemiological and molecular evidence reported by other sources [4, 22, 23] . For Italy, the analysis suggests that there was another independent SARS-CoV-2 introduction with no genomic evidence that it led to further spread. Similarly, at least two introductions are hypothesized for Netherlands (Fig. A4) ; however in that case both resulted in sustained host-to-host transmissions inside the country. The first Netherlands cluster is part of the major European cluster, while the second one could be linked to the Wuhan-1 haplotype (p e = 1). Interestingly, this cluster has the genetic signature in the form of codon deletion in nsp2 genomic region that was observed only there; furthermore, both viral substrains are not geographically separated and co-exist in the same cities. A similar situation is observed in Germany, connected to the major European cluster and a separate branch sampled at North Rhine-Westphalia and directly linked to the Wuhan-1 haplotype (p e = 1). Multiple introductions have also been observed in Finland. Haplotypes from Switzerland, Spain and Czech Republic are only observed in the main European cluster and most probably were introduced from Italy; in the latter case, this claim has an epidemiological support as the infected person reportedly had traveled Italy.",

The analysis allowed to identify the potential transmission links and routes of disease introduction in different regions of the planet, and confirm the hypothesis that there were multiple sources of introduction to the majority of countries. This conclusion supports the implementation of travel restrictions and border screening which have already been implemented in different locations. It should be also emphasized that the fact that a number of countries exhibited multiple introductions demonstrates how different susceptible human subpopulations are interconnected nowadays. This allowed the virus to exploit multiple transmission pathways and spread so rapidly. At the same time, our work underscores the need to put in place coordinated efforts involving multiple countries in order to achieve epidemic control. The scale-free structure of the global SARS-CoV-2 transmission network suggests that a few genomes were responsible for the spread of the virus. The question whether this pattern is due to founder effects, epidemiological settings or differences in phenotypic features across SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants remains open and will require further investigation. Furthermore, scale-freeness of the network should be taken into account in epidemiological modelling and planning of public health intervention measure, since epidemic processes on such networks exhibit a specific behaviour [44, 50] .",

This has led to a high density sampling that is unprecedented for both the geographic extent of virus spread and the evolutionary space explored by the virus since its emergence in China. Since the pandemic is currently only a few months old, no epidemiologically relevant lineages from the beginning of the epidemics are expected to die out anytime soon. Indeed, although the virus genetic diversity is gradually increasing, particular genomic variants continue to be repeatedly sequenced at different time points and geographical locations. It provides the means of tracking virus spread and evolution across time and space from the beginning of the epidemics using the methods of computational genomics and molecular epidemiology, and make conclusions about the potential routes of transmission.",

            "text": "We should warn that the results of such molecular surveillance analyses should be interpreted with caution. First of all, the genomic analyses do not necessarily replace traditional epidemiology methods that aim to investigate sources of transmission based on traditional surveillance systems that keeps track of the trajectory of the epidemic. Rather, genomic analyses complement and confirm other epidemiological findings using the sequencing data as an independent source of information that is not subject to the biases associated with the traditional epidemiological data [27, 2] . Second, it is important to understand that the edges in the estimated global transmission network may not be synonymous with actual transmission events, but rather link infected hosts from the same epidemiological transmission clusters. Furthermore, the analysis is subject to the limitations associated with the nature of genomic data that include a small amount of cases in the beginning of the epidemics, underreporting and potential multiple sources of epidemic introductions. Further, the dataset available for this analysis is a convenience sample rather than a random sample within infected individuals, which results from the aggregation of data from different countries and sequencing labs and instruments. This is an inevitable consequence of sequencing data analysis since the procedure itself can be relatively expensive when implemented on a large scale [57, 55, 45] , and the decision to sequence each particular case is largely done subjectively in each specific country and lab.",
