The positive effects of the Chinese measures have become evident in the past few weeks, and the Chinese data can thus be used as a reference to better analyze the situation in other countries. A variety of approaches may be used. One example consists in collecting data on various cities in a given country and comparing them to a set of historical data collected in a series of cities judged relevant in China. Coupled with epidemic spreading modeling, this procedure may help extrapolate the trends to be expected in the cities under study, and to deduce forecasts for the entire country. Unfortunately, as the European cities under consideration are still in a very early stage of the epidemic's development, this approach is very imprecise and the extrapolations obtained may be of weak reliability. For instance, one such study released on March 8, 2020 predicted that the final total number of diagnosed confirmed cases in Italy after the end of the epidemic would reach approximately 7,000 +/-1,000 [1] . Today we know that this number was significantly underestimated, as four days later the official records exceeded 15,000 confirmed cases. This shows the need of a simpler but more robust method in order to guide authorities.",

Beyond the maximum, it is worthwhile noting that the China curve falls off as the number of daily new cases starts to decrease. The number of confirmed cases continues to increase; nevertheless at a slower pace, and finally stabilizes at a significantly higher value than what was recorded at the maximum.

Assuming this progression regime remains the same across the entire ascending part of the curve, the maximum number of confirmed cases for Italy is estimated to reach around 55,000. Assuming further the efficiency of the Italian lockdown to be similar to that of China, we then add a downward slope matching the Chinese one.

Calculating this would require knowledge of the actual mortality rate; e.g. the final number of deaths relative to the final number of infections. If symptomatic cases are the only ones counted, then the number of infection cases are underestimated, and the apparent mortality rate is computed to be higher than it actually is. During the epidemic progression this apparent mortality rate may change over time. Since the epidemic onset in Italy for instance, as of March 15 a steady increase in the apparent mortality rate can be observed. This may be due to a combination of causes: a decrease in the efficiency of case detection as the number of infections grows, a concomitant decrease in medical care efficiency, and effects linked to the time-lag between the detection of early symptoms and actual death [5] . If one uses the WHO's average mortality rate estimate of 3.4% then Italy's final death toll would rise to approximately 5,000. However with the significantly higher apparent mortality rate of 8.3% observed on March 18, 2020 [2] and its still increasing trend, more than 10.000 deaths may be expected. This range of numbers should be compared to the approximately 3,300 deaths in China.",

The French case may lead towards an outcome in number of cases of the same magnitude as Italy's, with a smaller final death toll as the observed apparent mortality is smaller as of March 18.

Therefore this increase does not prove by itself that sanitary measures are being effective. Such a conclusion can only be reached when a change of dynamical regime occurs, showing a persistent deviation from the trend such as shown in Fig.1 or from the law given by eq. (1) for Italy and eq.

Now assume that a country suddenly changes its counting method, resulting in K changing to K new : the corresponding points on the country curve will be shifted vertically. But as new cases counted with K new accumulate, they will outnumber the previous points and the curve will revert to the underlying trend (within a gradually smaller vertical shift) and to its associated slope. An example is seen in China's curve in Fig. 1 . The sharp peak corresponds to the country's decision of February 12 to extend counting to \"clinically diagnosed cases\" (e.g. using CT scans), a decision that suddenly increased the numbers and provoked some confusion.

(1) of the main text. Any couple (t 0 , N 0 ) may be used as long as N 0 is large enough to be devoid of statistical fluctuation. As a direct check we show in Fig. 2 below that the observed N(t) for Italy indeed follows this law very closely.Most measuring methods will underestimate the actual number of cases N act (t), which we can describe using an unknown proportional constant K such that N act (t) = KN(t).",
