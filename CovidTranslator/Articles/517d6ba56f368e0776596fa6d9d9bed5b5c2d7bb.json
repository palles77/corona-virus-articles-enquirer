Several diseases have assumed greater importance as the performance and pleasure horse populations and equine activities have increased and there are new owners who do not understand the implications of equine infectious disease outbreaks to their animals. In addition, emerging diseases have beset the equine species in recent years in North America. Firstly, the introduction of the Old World West Nile virus to a susceptible population has made the the virus to be considered as endemic. Secondly, the change in the antigenicity of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) to induce a more aggressive form of neurological disease may affect clusters of horses than the field strain encountered previously. Fortunately, North America has been spared the infection caused by the paramyxovirus responsible for Hendra virus infection spread by flying foxes (bats), which is a zoonotic disease and a deadly infection of horses in Australia. However, other infectious diseases are more likely to emerge among horses in North America in the next decade as pathogens and vectors move into and become accustomed to new climate zones. The threat of emergent diseases is apparent in the UK, where a warming climate could precipitate a northward spread of those Culicoides spp. responsible for African horse sickness among a highly susceptible population.",

The National Animal Health Monitoring System (1998) survey raised the specter that a significant number of horses throughout the United States do not receive regular vaccinations and preventive health is not part of the owners' protocol. Therefore, much work remains to be done in communicating the message before a devastating outbreak of infectious disease among horses takes hold. Unfortunately, vaccines are unavailable or are inefficient for several infectious diseases in the United States. Successful vaccines to protect against equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and equine strangles are awaited.",
