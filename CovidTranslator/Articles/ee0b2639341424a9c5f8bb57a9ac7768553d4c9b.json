While most cells require ECM adhesion to survive, it is now clear that differentiated function is intimately dependent upon cellular interaction with the ECM. Therefore, it is not surprising that the ECM is increasingly found to be involved in the enigmatic process of neurodegeneration. Descriptive studies of human neurodegenerative disorders and experimental studies of animal models of neurodegeneration have begun to define potential mechanisms of ECM disruption that can lead to synaptic and neuronal loss.",

PNNs are reticular networks observed on the surface of neuronal cell bodies and proximal dendrites ( Figure 1 ). As the name implies, the ECM materials deposited in the space between neurons and astrocytic processes ensheath the neuronal cell surface with a netlike structure ( Figure 1 ). While histologically bland in appearance, PNNs vary in character and distribution, each with a potentially unique molecular structure surrounding a wide variety of neurons (31) . This structure includes lecticans, hyaluronic acid (HA), tenascin-C and tenascin-R. It is thought that the HA-lecticans-tenascin complex deposited on neuronal surfaces may form a repulsive barrier against approaching axons and dendrites. The absence of synaptic contacts along neuronal surfaces covered by PNN supports this hypothesis.",

The diversity of proteoglycans in the ECM is dependent on differential expression of genes encoding core proteins, alternative splicing and transcription-termination, as well as variations in the length and types of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains. Built around a core protein, polymers of 20-200 disaccharide repeats are attached through serine residues. Classified on the basis of disaccharide composition, GAGs are grouped as chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate (HS) and keratan sulfate (KS). HA is a non-sulfonated polymer of glucosamine and glucoronic acid, which exists as a protein-free polysaccharide on cell surfaces and in the ECM (8) . Chondroitin sulfate (CS) or HS side chains compose most central nervous system (CNS) proteoglycans; some of them are constituents of the ECM and others are bound to cell surfaces by a transmembrane domain or anchored with glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI). Proteoglycans can either promote or inhibit neuritic growth and possibly synaptic remodeling. Both the protein core and GAG side chains contribute to promoting or inhibiting neurite growth ( Table 1 ) (8) .",

In fact, the localization and biological activity of factors such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) depend strongly on the presence and composition of the ECM. Cells that express high-affinity receptors but lack surface HS do not respond to these ligands (94) . HSPG can stabilize FGF, protect it from proteolysis and serve as a co-receptor influencing its interaction with cell surface high-affinity receptors ( Figure 2 ) (77, 91) . Specific structural aspects, including sulfonation of HSPG, are required for the proper interaction of HSPG with FGF. Thus, the regulation of GAG biosynthesis and modification greatly influences the functions of HSPG. The differential binding characteristics of specific HS structures can potentiate or inhibit the biological activity of FGFs (8) . Other growth factor families, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), are known to bind to heparin/HS, which can modulate their biological activities (66, 72) . The interaction between chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and growth factors has attracted less attention; however, recent evidence supports the ability of CS chains to bind growth factors and to modulate their role in growth factor cell signaling. Phosphacan binds basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and potentiates its mitogenic activity almost as effectively as heparin (59) . Oversulfated CS-E was shown to bind midkine, heparin-binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM), bFGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, FGF10, FGF16 and FGF18 (28) . Appican, the proteoglycan form of amyloid precursor protein, contains oversulfated CS-E and is capable of interacting with midkine and HB-GAM; however, not much is known about its effect on their biological activities (88) .",

            "text": "The two major systems that modify the adult brain matrix are the serine protease tissue plasminogen activators (tPAs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The MMPs are synthesized as proenzymes with removal of a propeptide as a prerequisite for activation. They are synchronously expressed with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which form tight complexes with the enzyme. Activation of MMPs can occur through plasmin generation by tPAs, thus functionally linking the two proteolytic systems. The tPAs are also secreted in a precursor form as single-chain polypeptides and in vitro are converted by plasmin to active double-chain forms. Regulation of tPA activity in the nervous system can occur at multiple levels: transcription, translation, secretion and inhibition by anti-proteases. Despite high levels of tPA mRNA in the hippocampal CA1 region, protein and enzymatic assays show no evidence of tPA, suggesting stringent translational control (39) . Synaptic signaling can release this control and can lead to tPA secretion. Inhibition of tPA activity is under tight control by a variety of serpin family anti-proteases (eg, protease-nexin 1, neuroserpin and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) (39) . Some tPA effects are plasminogen independent (eg, cleavage of NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, enhancement of NMDA-mediated intracellular calcium levels or binding of the LDL receptor-related protein) and promote upregulation of MMP-9, degradation of the ECM resulting in synaptic plasticity or neuronal degeneration (55) . The mechanisms of activation of tPAs and MMPs in vivo are still poorly understood. The detailed molecular biology and biochemistry of these enzyme systems have been extensively documented elsewhere (27, 34, 52, 63, 95, 96) . For purposes of this review, these proteolytic and GAG-degrading enzymes, such as heparanase and chondroitinase, are key components in modulating cellular interactions with ECM (eg, proteolytic cleavage of core proteins or degradation of GAG side chains). MMPs are generally secreted; however, they can be localized to cell surfaces by binding to cell adhesion molecules or cell surface proteoglycans and integrins or through transmembrane domains of membrane-type MMPs. Another subgroup of metalloproteases is the A disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS). ADAMs are membrane-anchored enzymes that possess both proteolytic and adhesive activities. They are involved in shedding of cytokines, receptors and growth factors as well as adhesion to integrins. TNF\u03b1-converting enzyme or ADAM17 is the most characterized sheddase releasing TNF\u03b1 from the cell surface (16) . ADAMTSs are secreted enzymes that are involved in the cleavage of ECM proteoglycans and in collagen processing (71) . MMP secretion has been shown to contribute to the migration ability of monocytes as well as astrocyte motility (56, 62, 67, 69, 74, 82) . MMPs can also be secreted by neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells (52) . The MMP inhibitors (TIMPs) are expressed in neurons and astrocytes in the adult CNS (25) . tPA is expressed both in neurons and microglial cells and is highly expressed in regions involved in learning and memory. The activity of tPA in neural tissue is correlated with neurite outgrowth, regeneration and migration, suggesting that it might be involved in neuronal plasticity (58) .",

Antibodies against neuronal cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs) or removal of the associated carbohydrate polysialic acid prevents LTP, whereas bFGF enhances LTP in the dentate gyrus. Stabilization of LTP has been suppressed in an early phase of LTP by recombinant HB-GAM, which is known to bind to HSPGs in hippocampal slice cultures. Soluble syndecan-3's potential to modulate cell matrix associated with synaptic plasticity has been demonstrated by its suppression of tetanus-induced LTP after application to the CA1 area of hippocampal slice cultures. Synaptically localized syndecans may be involved in binding to certain growth factors, thereby potentiating their action on synaptic receptor kinases, leading to induction of cytoskeletal changes. The late temporal expression of syndecan-2 within developing synapses suggests a role more closely associated with dendritic spine maturation rather than with early spine formation. This proposed role is supported by experimental evidence that syndecan-2 overexpression in hippocampal neurons accelerates spine maturation without affecting the total number of synapses (8) .",

Stroke also induces growth-promoting proteins in this region of glial scar, including GAP43, cytoskeleton-associated protein 23, myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate and small proline repeat rich protein 1. Thus, the glial scar of a stroke is a narrow region that closely borders the infarct and contains increased expression of both growth-promoting and growthinhibitory molecules. The peri-infarct region that lies just outside of the glial scar has reduced levels of growth-inhibitory molecules.

Two days after injection, neurons in CA1, CA2 and CA3 had degenerated. These results indicate that laminin degradation precedes neuronal loss after KA treatment and occurs in exactly the same hippocampal regions that eventually experience neuronal degeneration. The CA3 region that showed more laminin expression was more resistant to excitotoxin-induced neuronal cell death. This correlation between high laminin expression and neuronal resistance to excitotoxin further implicates laminin as an important factor in maintaining cellular viability.

Achim and Wiley (1) reported that at autopsy, AIDS patients who had clinical dementia during terminal stages of their disease demonstrated human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (HIVE). The constellation of neuropathological changes associated with HIVE includes activated and infected macrophages, astrocytosis and neurodegeneration (18) . As neurons are not infected by HIV, the etiology of neurodegeneration must be indirect. Current leading theories suggest that neurodegeneration results from neurotoxic viral or inflammatory factors. The ability of activated monocytes and macrophages to penetrate the ECM and to migrate to target tissues is dependent on ECMdegrading proteins like MMPs and heparanase. This degradation of ECM components could result in disintegration of the structure that physically and physiologically supports neurons, and thus could lead to degeneration.",

Although PNNs were lost in HIVE, there was no loss of parvalbumin-, calbindin-and calretinin-positive neurons that are frequently surrounded by these nets. ECM destruction was not confined to microglial nodules, suggesting that if macrophages were the source of released ECM-degrading enzymes, these would need to diffuse throughout the brain parenchyma. Alternatively, macrophages could activate astrocytes to secrete enzymes responsible for the metabolism of the ECM. Staining for Vicia villosa agglutinin, a lectin that binds to N-acetyl-galactoseamine residues on CS or dermatan sulfate (DS), was lost before the core protein staining, suggesting that the degradation of the GAG chains occurs before the actual degradation of the core protein (9) . A more indirect indication of GAG chain degradation in lentiviral encephalitis is the presence of HA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (49) . Support of these findings of ECM degradation in AIDS comes from the SIV encephalitis model in rhesus and pigtailed macaques. Disruption of brain ECM was present in SIV cases without encephalitis, but was more severe in cases with encephalitis (57) . This suggests that ECM changes occur prior to parenchymal macrophage infiltration. ECM changes in SIVE occur concurrently with reduced staining for the pre-and postsynaptic marker synaptophysin and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). One possible source of ECM degradation activity is the induced microglial/macrophage expression of ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4 (57) and MMP-2 and MMP-7, as observed by their elevation in the CSF of patients with HIVD (24) . Other sources of ECM-degrading enzymes include astrocytes or lymphocytes as shown in the coronavirus-induced encephalitis in mice, where increased mRNA levels of MMP-3 and MMP-12 as well as the inhibitor TIMP-1 were found. In this model, MMP-3 expression was restricted to astrocytes and TIMP-1 expression was localized with CD4-positive cells. However, when T-cells were removed from this model using irradiation-immunosuppression, mice that had high viral load in the CNS showed increased mRNA levels of MMP-3, MMP-12 and TIMP-1, suggesting that viral replication directly triggers upregulation of these proteins (100).",

Glypican-1 co-localized in CAA in AD and hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (90) . Syndecan-2 was frequently associated with vascular A\u03b2 in AD but not with vascular A\u03b2 deposits in hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type (42).

In non-affected areas, HSPG was associated with blood vessels within the brain parenchyma and was lost in affected areas, suggesting a change in basement membrane structure. Ultra-structural studies specifically localized the HSPGs to amyloid fibrils present in SPs and CAA.

MMP-induced changes can induce changes in plasticity. Although TIMPs seem to be elevated in response to MMP activity, they also serve biological activities that are distinct from MMP inhibition. Therefore, it is not clear how the balance between MMPs and TIMPs is modulating ECM integrity and its exact role in neurodegeneration. The complexity of the sheer number of potential proteases and their inhibitors makes elucidating their mechanism of modulating ECM a daunting task. Added to the complex transcriptional and translational control of different neuroglial and immune cells, deciphering mechanisms of ECM modulation in various disease states remains an important challenge.",

Increased tPA activates CNS plasminogen to plasmin, which can degrade laminin and other components of the ECM. tPA-deficient mice exhibit less microglial activation in reaction to neuronal injury (87) . In contrast, the microglial response of plasminogen-deficient mice is comparable to that of wild-type mice, suggesting a tPA-mediated (plasminogen-independent) pathway for activation of microglia. Infusion of inhibitors of tPA/plasmin proteolytic cascade into the hippocampus protects neurons against excitotoxic injury.

MMP proteolysis can activate or inhibit the biological functions of chemokines (89) . Apoptotic cells trigger the recruitment of phagocytic cells through release of chemoattractants. It has been shown that apoptotic neurons release the active form of MMP-3 that elicits microglial secretion of TNF\u03b1 (48) . The chemokine fractalkine is cleaved by MMPs after excitotoxic injury. Although inhibition of MMPs by batimastat inhibits fractalkine cleavage, it does not confer neuroprotection. Release of fractalkine from neurons plays a pivotal role in attracting microglia and other cells derived from the monocytic lineage (22) . Mice genetically deficient for the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) display decreased microglial recruitment and resist excitotoxic neurodegeneration. MCP-1 undergoes proteolytic processing mediated by plasmin, enhancing the potency of MCP-1 in in vitro migration assays. Infusion of the cleaved form of MCP-1 into the CNS restores microglial recruitment and excitotoxicity in plasminogen-deficient mice (81) .

Unsulfated chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate were found associated with SPs, NFTs and dystrophic neurites (29) . These results suggest that CSPG could contribute or be responsible for the regression of neurites around SPs in AD. Abnormal CSPG accumulation could disrupt cell adhesion or growth factor utilization (29) . Deposition of CSPG has been found at the periphery of SP cores. It has been hypothesized that neurotoxicity is not simply the consequence of \u03b2-amyloid aggregation. Implantation of nitrocellulose impregnated with \u03b2-amyloid in the cortex of neonatal rats caused reactive gliosis in addition to deposition of CSPGs. Secondary glial cell reaction to the insoluble molecule and CSPGs, along with other proteoglycans, may be an additional link in the chain of events leading to neuronal dystrophy and possibly neuronal death (20) .",

HSPGs were also demonstrated in \"primitive plaques\" (defined as those having little or no amyloid core), suggesting that their accumulation takes place during early stages of plaque development. HSPGs were localized to astrocytes and neurons in close proximity of SPs and CA, suggesting that both may be involved in the deposition of HSPGs at these sites and may, therefore, play a role in plaque development. Ultrastructural studies specifically localized the HSPGs to amyloid fibrils present in SPs and CA. This close association between amyloid fibrils and HSPGs suggests that HSPGs have an important role in amyloidosis (83) . Other support for this idea comes from the work of Liu et al, who found that agrin co-localizes with \u03b1-synuclein in neuronal Lewy bodies in the SN of Parkinson's disease brain. Agrin was found to accelerate formation of protofibrils by \u03b1-synuclein and to decrease the half-time of fibril formation (51) .

It has been shown that reconstituted extracellular matrix (rECM) (growth factor depleted Matrigel\u2122) promotes apoptosis by recruitment of STAT1 and cAMP response elementbinding protein to the \u03b3-activating sequence element of the IRF-1 promoter and the subsequent induction of IRF-1 and caspase-1 and -3 activation (14) . In addition, the cAMP response element-binding protein regulates mammary epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis through binding the LAMA3A promoter and transcriptional activation of laminin-5 (30).",

Age-related progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, are characterized by changes in the expression of proteoglycans and association with protein aggregation and amyloidosis. It is not known whether protein aggregation or deposition is a primary event leading to those secondary events of proteoglycan expression or whether the two processes are interrelated. Alternatively, changes in proteoglycans are the primary event that triggers protein aggregation. These changes are accompanied by a secondary microglial activation. The role and timing of microglial activation relative to A\u03b2 deposition are controversial. The extent of microglial activation in A\u03b2 deposition has been hypothesized to be limited to the transition from diffuse to mature plaques, when amounts of A\u03b2 deposits and the degree of neuritic changes increase (78) . As of now, no clear correlation between ECM breakdown and neuronal death is apparent. From the work of Bruckner et al, it seems that neurons surrounded by PNNs are spared from neurodegenerative changes in AD. Breakdown of the PNNs mostly around parvalbumin-positive neurons without the actual loss of the neurons suggests a change in the neuronal environment that could affect their function or susceptibility to further insult.",

The induction of MMPs and tPA activity can further enhance the inflammatory response by inducing chemotaxis and generation of products that increase microglial reactivity or augment ingress of blood monocytes. Apart from inducing ECM proteolytic activity, not much is known about how the changes in the ECM affect neurons and what are the signaling pathways and response elements involved in neurodegeneration. From other model systems, it is clear that cell-ECM interactions can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level.

Treatment of cultures with an antibody against integrin \u03b21 abolished the protective effect of laminin. As neurons maintained on laminin exhibited a sustained activation of the Akt signaling pathway, levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were increased. This could be reversed by treatment with wortmannin (37) . Rho GTPases are key transducers of integrin/ECM and growth factor signaling. Rac was found as a critical pro-survival GTPase in cerebellar granule neurons. Clostridium difficile toxin B, a specific Rho family inhibitor, induced a selective caspase-mediated degradation of Rac-1. Both Tox B and dominant negative N17Rac-1 elicited cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis, characterized by cytochrome C release and activation of caspase-9 and 3. ToxB stimulated mitochondrial translocation and conformational activation of Bax, c-Jun activation and induction of the BH3 protein Bim. These results indicate that Rac acts downstream of integrins and growth factors to promote neuronal survival by repressing c-Jun/Bim-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis (50) .",

Unfortunately, the complexity of potential factors and abundance of various models has not allowed resolution of whether ECM alterations precede or postdate neuronal dysfunction. The studies highlighted in this review support the importance of the ECM in mounting the differentiated integrity of neuronal function and that disturbance of ECM in disease is casually related to neurodegeneration. Neurons surrounded by PNNs are less affected by these disease processes suggesting that laminin and integrin signaling are important for neuronal survival. From other model systems, it is apparent that cell-ECM interactions are important for the regulation of transcription factors that can promote apoptosis. Elucidation of the interaction between neurons and their surrounding ECM remains a daunting problem for neuropathology. Interaction of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Possible mechanisms of extracellular matrix (ECM)-related neurodegeneration. Aging or protein aggregation accelerated by genetic mutation can be associated with ECM alterations that would result to co-deposition of ECM components [eg, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs)]. Those ECM alterations can result in loss of protective perineuronal nets (PNNs) and increased susceptibility to cell death. Dying neurons can induce inflammation, degradation of ECM and induction of a more robust inflammatory response. Alternatively, inflammatory-induced neurodegeneration can induce ECM degradation through proteolytic activity [eg, matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)], induction of chemotaxis and microglial activation.
