            "text": "Background: Mechanisms influencing severity of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children are not established. We aimed to assess the role of inflammatory markers and respiratory viruses in ALRI severity. Methods: Concentrations of interleukin(IL)-33, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity (sST)2, IL-1\u00df, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-8 and types of respiratory viruses were evaluated in children at the first and fifth days after hospital admission. Disease severity was defined as need for mechanical ventilation. Results: Seventy-nine children < 5 years-old were included; 33(41.8%) received mechanical ventilation. No associations between virus type, viral load or co-detections and severity of disease were observed. Detection of IL-33 and sST2 in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) on admission were associated with higher risk for mechanical ventilation (RR = 2.89 and RR = 4.57, respectively). IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were higher on Day 5 in mechanically ventilated children. IL-6 NPA concentrations decreased from Day 1 to Day 5 in children who did not receive mechanical ventilation. Increase in sST2 NPA concentrations from Day 1 to Day 5 was associated with longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.01). Conclusions: An exacerbated local activation of the IL-33/ST2 axis and persistently high sST2 concentrations over time were associated with severity of viral ALRI in children.",

Respiratory viruses represent key pathogens involved in ALRI and can cause pneumonia and acute viral bronchiolitis in infants and young children [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . While young age, prematurity and co-morbidities have been identified as predictors of poor outcomes [6] [7] [8] [9] , the role of virus types and host inflammatory responses in disease severity is not well defined, as published results are inconsistent [10, 11] . Lately, a model of immune inflammatory response in which an imbalance between T helper (Th)1, Th2 and regulatory T cells could be responsible for severe cases of ALRI in infants and young children has been suggested [10, 12, 13] . In addition, Interleukin (IL)-33, a member of the interleukin-1 family expressed in epithelium surfaces, along with its receptor, suppression of tumorigenicity (ST)2, may play an important role in the immune response associated with asthma, autoimmune disorders and infections [14, 15] . There is experimental and clinical evidence showing the involvement of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the inflammatory responses to viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [16, 17] , influenza [18] , rhinovirus [19] and metapneumovirus [20, 21] .",

Similar to our findings, Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al. [13] reported higher detectable IL-33 NPA levels in infants infected by RSV and rhinovirus on hospital admission when comparing to healthy controls, although no associations between higher IL-33 detections and ICU admissions or longer hospital lengths of stay were found. Saravia et al. [16] described higher IL-33 NPA concentrations in 19 infants with RSV acute viral bronchiolitis on hospital admission when compared to IL-33 NPA concentrations 28 days later, after hospital discharge. In contrast, Christiaansen et al. [24] found that higher NPA concentrations of IL-33 on hospital admission were associated with milder disease in 23 RSV infected infants. It is worth mentioning that none of the studies evaluated the same inflammatory markers in a different moment of hospitalization other than on admission. Concentrations of these molecules on Day 5 of hospital stay enabled us to characterize the host response in the acute phase of the disease. The soluble form of ST2, which is one of the mechanisms of IL-33 down regulation, has been identified as a reliable biomarker of poor prognosis in cardiovascular diseases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other inflammatory conditions [25, 26] . Furthermore, while IL-33 plays an important role in tissue repair and restores tissue homeostasis in infectious and chronic inflammatory diseases, persistently high sST2 levels is often implicated in the emergence of tissue fibrosis. Indeed, sustained high serum concentrations of sST2 on the first three days of mechanical ventilation in adults with ARDS were associated with longer hospital length of stay, extubation failure and mortality [25] . Similarly, we have found that detection of sST2 in NPA samples on admission shows a high sensitivity and good accuracy in predicting need for mechanical ventilation in children with viral ALRI. Also, an increment of sST2 concentration over time was associated with a prolonged hospital stay in our patients. A multicenter cohort study [27] performed by Faber et al. reported high concentrations of sST2 on admission in the NPA of infants intubated for RSV bronchiolitis. Soluble ST2 concentrations were 20 times higher in the intubated group, when compared to those with milder disease. Although it is well known that the IL-33/ST2 axis takes part in eosinophilic modulation in asthma, the role of ST2 in neutrophilic inflammation of the airway, which is considered to be the main cause of ALRI severity in the pediatric population [28] , is still poorly understood [29] . Schaunaman et al et al. [29] demonstrated an overexpression of ST2 in cultured normal human primary airway epithelial cells leading to neutrophilic chemoattractant IL-8 production, which was independently associated with M. pneumoniae or rhinovirus infection. Indeed, we observed an increase in IL-8 concentrations in NPA samples in both groups. IL-8 is mostly responsible for the local neutrophil afflux, which has been associated with mucus accumulation that has an important role in viral containment in upper respiratory tract, but can also lead to airway and alveolar obstruction. In fact, high concentrations of IL-8 have been often correlated to worse outcomes, such as hypoxemia and mechanical ventilation [10] .",

            "text": "Despite these observations, increased concentrations of IL-6 and IL- 8 found in the mechanical ventilation group in our study could be due to the inflammatory response caused by mechanical ventilation itself, as previously suggested [31] . Even though IL1-\u00df and TNF\u03b1 have been frequently associated with disease severity [28, [32] [33] [34] , our results do not corroborate these findings. We also detected an increment of IL-4 NPA concentrations in both studied groups from Day 1 to Day 5 of hospital stay. IL-4 is a typical Th2 response cytokine, frequently implicated in the emergence of recurring wheezing episodes and asthma exacerbations, especially related to rhinovirus infection [12, 19] . In our study, we did not observe any association between viral etiology, viral load or co-infections and disease severity. Viral-related risk factors for severe disease are not well established, as the pathogenesis of ALRI is the result of a complex interaction of environmental factors, viral virulence and host responses [35] [36] [37] [38] . Whereas studies in genomics have mapped transcriptome features in the host leading to inflammatory responses that are unique according to viral etiology and age of the patient [38] , Cavallaro et al. [28] reported that the severity of the inflammatory response was independent of viral etiology. They also did not find an association between disease severity and co-infections, which was corroborated by a recently published meta-analysis [39] . A retrospective observational study on mechanically ventilated children with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU showed no differences on duration of respiratory support or PICU length of stay between bronchiolitis caused by only one virus and more than one virus [40] . Hospital length of stay, however, was longer in the co-detection group. On the other hand, a recent publication reported an association between ALRI in children by coronavirus alone or in co-detection with rhinovirus C and severity of the disease, defined as need for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit in our hospital [41] . On regards to viral load, many studies have assessed the role of RSV viral load in predicting worse outcomes, with conflicting results [42] . It has been recently suggested that higher RSV viral loads at presentation elicits a more robust inflammatory response, resulting in faster viral clearance, which could be associated with milder disease [43] .",
