            "text": "Subunit/split influenza vaccines are less reactogenic compared with the whole virus vaccines. However, their immunogenicity is relatively low and thus required proper adjuvant and/or delivery vehicle for immunogenicity enhancement. Influenza vaccines administered intramuscularly induce minimum, if any, mucosal immunity at the respiratory mucosa which is the prime site of the infection. In this study, chitosan (CS) nanoparticles were prepared by ionic cross-linking of the CS with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) at the CS/TPP ratio of 1:0.6 using 2 h mixing time. The CS/TPP nanoparticles were used as delivery vehicle of an intranasal influenza vaccine made of hemagglutinin (HA)-split influenza virus product. Innocuousness, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the CS/TPP-HA vaccine were tested in influenza mouse model in comparison with the antigen alone vaccine. The CS/TPP-HA nanoparticles had required characteristics including nano-sizes, positive charges, and high antigen encapsulation efficiency. Mice that received two doses of the CS/TPP-HA vaccine intranasally showed no adverse symptoms indicating the vaccine innocuousness. The animals developed higher systemic and mucosal antibody responses than vaccine made of the HA-split influenza virus alone. The CS/TPP-HA vaccine could induce also a cell-mediated immune response shown as high numbers of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells in spleens while the HA vaccine alone could not. Besides, the CS nanoparticle encapsulated HA-split vaccine reduced markedly the influenza morbidity and also conferred 100% protective rate to the vaccinated mice against lethal influenza virus challenge. Overall results indicated that the CS nanoparticles invented in this study is an effective and safe delivery vehicle/adjuvant for the influenza vaccine.",

            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious devastating respiratory disease which causes public health and socio-economic problems worldwide (1) . Currently available influenza vaccines are made of either inactivated whole viruses or the virus subunit/ split products (2) . The former vaccine is highly immunogenic but often causes adverse reactions particularly in infants and children (3, 4) . Therefore many countries prefer the subunit/ split vaccines for their people (5, 6) . However, the less reactogenic vaccines confer limited immunogenicity and require either high antigenic dose or, in the case of naive subjects, a booster dose (7, 8) . Co-administration of an immunological adjuvant with the vaccine components improved immunogenicity leading to antigen sparing and adequate protective immune response after a single dose (9, 10) . Immunogenicity of the vaccine was enhanced better by emulsion adjuvants, i.e., AS03 (oil-in-water preparation) or MF59 (a squalene-based oil-in-water preparation), than alum due probably to recruitment of more inflammatory cells, lymphocytes, and antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) (11) . Nevertheless, the emulsion adjuvants also increase adverse reactions, both local and systemic (12, 13) .",

            "text": "Influenza vaccines are administered mostly by intramuscular route which has some limitations. Systemic immune response is induced but low, if there would be any, the respiratory mucosal response. Usually muscles have little antigenpresenting cells including dendritic cells and macrophages. The skeletal muscles do not express MHC molecules under normal conditions. Besides, human muscle cells express B7-H3, a B7 homolog, which functions as a co-inhibitory molecule of T cells for local immune regulatory processes (14) . Intranasal route for influenza vaccine administration, on the contrary, offers several advantages. Besides this route that is needleand painless, evidences have indicated also that the antigen activated immune cells at the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue commonly home at the respiratory immune effector sites including larynx-and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (15) and exert their defensive activities at the prime sites of influenza virus infection. Moreover, the vaccine components applied intranasally may reach the macrophages which roam about in the trachea and lungs. These cells may engulf the vaccine, become mature during their drainage to local lymph nodes (acquire ability to express co-signaling and MHC molecules and secrete cytokines), and present antigen to the T cells for induction of local immune response (16) . The vaccine antigen applied intranasally may also reach the blood circulation and the systemic immune response is stimulated in spleen and peripheral lymph nodes (17) . Thus, both mucosal and systemic immune responses can be expected after the intranasal immunization of appropriate vaccine formulation that could overcome the normal mucosal tolerance and breach the nasal epithelium tight junction (18) .",

Its mucoadhesive property could overcome the mucociliary clearance, thus increasing the resident time of the vaccine component in the nasal passage. CS promotes paracellular transportation of the cargo antigen through the nasal mucosa (22) . It served as an immunopotentiating agent to augment vaccine immunogenicity and effectiveness (23) . Besides, annotated data have demonstrated that the CS nanoparticles induced both mucosal and systemic immune responses to the entrapped antigen after intranasal administration (24, 25) .

Thus, immunological factor that operates at the infection prime site is highly important for prevention of the virus replication in the epithelial cells and further systemic spread. Intramuscular vaccines rarely induce the local immune response. Also, the antibody induced systemically by the parenteral vaccine usually do not reach the mucosal surface except by passive transudation which would occur only when the circulating IgG level is high and sustained or in the situation of pathotopic potentiation. Vaccine administration by intranasal route, on the other hand, stimulates both systemic and mucosal immune responses, particularly specific secretory IgA which are mucophilic and protease resistant, and therefore functions well as the first-line defense at the mucosa (31, 32) . However, immunogenicity acquired from the mucosal vaccine per se may be inadequate and thus effective adjuvant and/or vaccine delivery vehicle is required to improve the magnitude of the immune response (28, 33, 34) . Among various developing adjuvant/delivery systems, CS is favorable for intranasal vaccine due to its mucoadhesive property and ability to overcome the formidable nasal epithelial barrier (23, 35) . Several studies have demonstrated success in using CS nanoparticles as delivery systems for intranasal protein and DNA vaccines (36) (37) (38) .",

The ionic cross-linking technique is a shear force-, organic solvent-, and heat-free procedure; thus, it is suitable for vulnerable molecules such as the vaccine antigen of this study (39) . There are many factors to be considered in formulating suitable CS nanoparticles for the vaccine. These include concentrations of the CS and the TPP, the CS/TPP mass ratio, and the reagent mixing time. Therefore, the preliminary experiments were performed to screen and select the best CS and TPP combination in formation of the CS/TPP colloid. The ionic cross-linking between the CS cationic amine groups and the polyanion of TPP phosphate groups was used for preparing the CS/TPP nanoparticles. Data in the literature have demonstrated that spontaneous particle formation in the ionic cross-linkage occurred only at suitable concentrations of CS and TPP (40) . In this study, the nanoparticulate system of CS/TPP with good physicochemical properties, i.e., nanometer range in size, positive charge, and relatively high encapsulation efficiency, was achieved at CS/ TPP ratio of 1:0.6 by using 2 h mixing time However, physicochemical properties of CS nanoparticles product formed by ionic-cross-linking are affected by chemical properties of CS (molecular weight, degree of deacetylation, and chemical modification) and condition of preparation (pH, volume, and mixing time) (41) (42) (43) . Therefore, the characteristic of the CS/ TPP nanoparticles produced in one study may not be similar to that of another (38, 44) .",

In addition, HA-split virus product had pI 4.8; thus, at pH 5.4 it was negatively charged. Therefore, the antigen could be entrapped into the CS/TPP nanoparticles with relatively high percentage of encapsulation efficiency. According to the TEM image, the HA-split virus component might be condensed by the CS polymer chains along with the TPP to form the encapsulated nanoparticles. The CS/TPP-HA might be linked together through two different bonds. One possible association mechanism of the vaccine component with the nanoparticles besides the entrapment of the HA-split influenza virus product in the CS/TPP nanoparticles was the electrostatic interaction between the cathodic CS and the anodic vaccine component (46) .",

Many studies revealed that stronger and more robust immune responses were induced by submicron sizes of CS nanoparticles because the particles of this size range are readily phagocytosed by the antigen-presenting cells (55) (56) (57) . Data from mucus adsorption studies revealed that mucoadhesive particles, which are fine nanoparticles (230-320 nm), increased in penetration through the mucus layer. On the other hand, larger particles (2 \u03bcm) were adsorbed on the surface of mucosa (Langmuir-type adsorption) (58). CS ionic cross-linking-HA nanoparticles of this study had appropriate sizes of 351.00-358.67 nm as measured by using the Zetasizer. The particles when applied intranasally should be engulfed by the microfold (M) cell overlying the nasal associated lymphoid tissue and the intact antigen should be delivered appropriately to the follicular dendritic cells for local immune response stimulation. The antigen may be carried by the DCs to the local draining lymph nodes or distant lymphoid tissues where immune responses can be incited therein (59, 60) . The ability of the CS/TPP-HA in inducing systemic and mucosal immune responses has been demonstrated in this study by the high levels of HA-specific serum IgG antibodies and IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells in spleen and specific IgA antibodies in BALF and NW, respectively.",

All mice vaccinated intranasally with the CS nanoparticleentrapped HA-split vaccine survived the lethal infections while only partial (60%) and no protection (0%) were observed for mice that received HA-split vaccine alone against the low and the high doses, respectively.
