It is important in host defense against infection, as well as adaptive immune responses. Whilst a wide array of cytokines are known to be involved in adverse remodeling of the heart and the progression to heart failure, the role of IFN-\u03b3 is unclear. Recent evidence from clinical studies, animal models of myocarditis and hypertension, as well as isolated cell studies, provide conflicting data as to whether IFN-\u03b3 is pathological or protective in the heart. Thus, it is important to highlight these discrepant findings so that areas of future investigation can be identified to more clearly determine the precise role of IFN-\u03b3 in the heart. Accordingly, this review will: 1) discuss the source of IFN-\u03b3 in the diseased heart; 2) summarize the data from animal studies; 3) discuss the effects of IFN-\u03b3 on isolated cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes; 4) identify signaling mechanisms that may be invoked by IFN-\u03b3 in the heart; and 5) present the clinical evidence supporting a role for IFN-\u03b3 in heart failure.",

[1] identified a positive correlation between tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and chronic heart failure, many other cytokines have been identified as contributing to the causative processes of this disease. These include, but are not limited to: regulated upon activation, normal t-cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES); interleukin (IL)-6; cardiotropin; IL-8; IL-1; and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1 [2, 3] . These cytokines have effects on virtually all aspects of adverse myocardial remodeling and function. Targeting cytokines, predominantly the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1, has emerged as a powerful tool to treat autoimmune diseases and this approach is currently being used with relative success in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease for example. However, despite the clear role for TNF-\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of heart failure, targeting this cytokine has not become part of standard clinical practice due to the lack of success of several clinical trials aimed at inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 [4, 5] .",

Thus, there is a need to identify other cytokines that may serve as novel targets in this context. There is emerging evidence that interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) may represent a possible target either through inhibition, or conversely, as a treatment itself. The literature regarding IFN-\u03b3 is conflicted with some studies indicating that it is important in driving adverse myocardial remodeling leading to heart failure, and others suggesting that it has a protective function. Consequently, it is important to highlight these discrepant findings so that areas of future investigation can be identified to more clearly determine the precise role of IFN-\u03b3 in the heart.

            "text": "Inflammatory cells play a critical role in adverse remodeling of the heart in response to chronic and acute stress and injury, and therefore, ultimately the onset of heart failure. For example, young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR; 8 wk old) develop small foci of inflammatory cells, consisting of CD4 + , CD8 + , OX6 + (B cell) lymphocytes, as well as ED1 + macrophages, in perivascular and interstitial regions of the heart [6] . As these SHR age (12 months of age) fibroblasts expressing collagen I are consistently associated with inflammatory cells. In addition, all of the aforementioned inflammatory cell types are increased in areas of fibrosis. In humans, myocardial biopsies from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy show myocardial damage, severe interstitial fibrosis, and the influx of lymphocytes and macrophages [7] . Peak monocyte counts also correlate positively with left ventricular diastolic volume and negatively with ejection fraction in patients with acute myocardial infarction [8] . As cells in the damaged heart die by necrosis, they release their contents, which in turn stimulates this inflammatory response, including the release of cytokines and chemokines [9] . For example, IL-1 cytokines regulate the synthesis of other cytokines as well as leukocyte infiltration [10] , while inhibition of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) with a neutralizing antibody successfully reduces macrophage infiltration and fibrosis of the remote region of the heart in rats post-myocardial infarction [11] . Furthermore, anti-MCP-1 was found to prevent macrophage accumulation and attenuate perivascular and interstitial fibrosis in hypertension [12] .",

            "text": "These infiltrating inflammatory cells represent the primary, if not the only, source of IFN-\u03b3 in the heart. This is summarized in Table 1 . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from dogs infected with the trypanosoma cruzi parasite, produced excess amounts of IFN-\u03b3 when cultured [13] . Similarly, Cheng et al. [14] isolated PBMCs from congestive heart failure patients and incubated those cells with increasing concentrations of atorvastatin (0, 0.4, 1.0, and 4.0 \u03bcmol/L) for 72 hours. Atorvastatin suppressed IFN-\u03b3 production by the PBMCs in a concentration-dependent manner. Whilst neither study attempted to identify the specific inflammatory cell type(s) producing IFN-\u03b3, we have detected IFN-\u03b3 in the media of cultured bone marrow-derived mast cells (unpublished data). Further, we have reported in the SHR that elevated myocardial levels of IFN-\u03b3 are returned to normal when these animals are treated with the mast cell stabilizing compound nedocromil, suggesting cardiac mast cells as a potential source [15] . Although, in that same study we also found that mast cells were responsible for the recruitment of other inflammatory cells into the hypertensive heart, suggesting that mast cell stabilization may also have the effect of preventing recruitment of other inflammatory cells that produce IFN-\u03b3. In fact, using flow cytometry, Han et al. [16] recently identified that CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were a major source of IFN-\u03b3 in the hypertensive mouse heart. They also determined that macrophages contributed to the IFN-\u03b3 pool. An interesting observation was that when isolated and cultured alone, both T cells and macrophages produced almost no IFN-\u03b3. However, when co-cultured, IFN-\u03b3 levels dramatically increased (~20-fold increase). Co-culture of IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 T cells with wild type macrophages, resulted in significantly reduced IFN-\u03b3 production. The reciprocal experiment produced similar findings. Thus, T cell macrophage interactions appear to be important in determining IFN-\u03b3 levels.",

This was not the case for MIP-1\u03b1, where IFN-\u03b3 deletion had no effect. Together, this series of experiments by Han et al.

In dogs infected with various strains of the trypanosoma cruzi parasite, serum levels of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 increased dramatically, with the greatest increase being in IFN-\u03b3 (~6-7 fold) [13] . The authors also noted that those dogs with increased IFN-\u03b3 displayed myocardial remodeling including hypertrophy and fibrosis. Likewise in the SHR model of hypertension, we have found that myocardial IFN-\u03b3 levels are significantly elevated in 20 week old animals; an age where hypertrophy and fibrosis were present [15] . In mice, induction of a Th1 T cell phenotype resulted in a 12-fold increase in IFN-\u03b3 levels in the heart and was associated with concentric hypertrophy, increased total collagen, extensive collagen cross-linking and a stiffer left ventricle [17] . Over-expression of IFN-\u03b3 in the liver of transgenic mice increased circulating levels of the cytokine and caused myocardial inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and a trend towards increased apoptosis [18] . Interestingly, there was a significant up-regulation at the gene level of TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, MCP-1, and MIP1\u03b1. This alone appears to clearly indicate that IFN-\u03b3 is capable of regulating inflammatory cell recruitment as well as cytokine and chemokine production in the heart. Ultimately, these mice developed a thin walled, dilated cardiac phenotype with impaired systolic function. In support of those findings, Han et al. [16] found that IFN-\u03b3 mRNA and protein levels were increased in the hearts of wild type mice infused with angiotensin II for 7 days, and that infusion of angiotensin II into IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in a comparable level of cardiac hypertrophy as the wild type, but a significant reduction in cardiac fibrosis. This was also associated with suppressed T cell and macrophage infiltration into the hearts of the IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice following angiotensin II infusion. Not surprisingly then, deletion of IFN-\u03b3 also had profound effects on cytokine and chemokine production. Myocardial TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels, but not MIP-1\u03b1 mRNA, were reduced in the knockout mice following angiotensin II infusion. MCP-1 was also reduced. While this study examined the acute effects of IFN-\u03b3 gene deletion on adverse remodeling, the investigators did not investigate the role of IFN-\u03b3 in the subsequent development of heart failure.",

            "text": "In complete contrast to those findings, Garcia et al. [19] reported that 4 weeks of aldosterone infusion in mice caused a greater degree of hypertrophy in IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice than in the wild type, following removal of one kidney and high salt intake (1% in drinking water). This was characterized by an increased thickening of the ventricle wall and septum with no changes in chamber size detected. Administration of aldosterone also led to increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and impairment of diastolic function, which was again significantly worse in the IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to the wild type mice. In this model, fibrosis was unaffected by deletion of IFN-\u03b3 in that it remained elevated, similar to the wild type. It is unclear as to why there are such dramatic differences in the remodeling response between angiotensin II and aldosterone infusion/high salt models. Both studies used mice, although Han et al. used IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice on a B6.129 background for their angiotensin II infusions, whilst Garcia et al. conducted their aldosterone infusions/high salt on the BALB/c background. It has been shown that hearts from mice with a Th1 T cell background (C57B/ 6) remodel differently in response to pathologic stimuli than mice with a Th2 T cell background (BALBc). For example, C57B/6 mice develop concentric hypertrophy and fibrosis in response to angiotensin II, whereas BALBc mice develop a dilated phenotype with dramatically reduced ejection fraction [20] . Also, administration of L-NAME increased cardiac fibrillar collagen and percentage of fibrillar collagen cross-linking in BALB/c mice, but not in C57B/6 mice [21] . Alternatively, it is possible that the disparate findings related to IFN-\u03b3 could represent differences in the disease etiology in that angiotensin II induces hypertension due to vasoconstriction, whereas the aldosterone model is salt-induced.",

Studies using an isolated rat atria preparation have shown that concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 ranging between 2 and 10 U/mL, have an inhibitory effect on contraction [23] . This appears to be mediated by cholinergic pathways because atropine was able to completely abolish this effect. IFN-\u03b3 was also able to increase intracellular levels of cGMP and abolish activation of adenylate cyclase by the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol. In addition to effects on contractility, IFN-\u03b3 also appears to influence release of specific products by cardiomyocytes. Murine embryonic cardiomyocytes responded to IFN-\u03b3 (100 U/mL, 48 hrs) by producing MIP-1\u03b1 (CCL3), RANTES (CCL5), and CXCL1 [24] . Further, stimulation of murine fetal cardiomyocytes with IFN-\u03b3 resulted in a 15-fold increase in atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) expression [25] . It is important to keep in mind that these studies were conducted in embryonic and neonatal cardiomyocytes, and how these results translate to the adult cardiomyocyte is unknown. However, Patten et al. [26] did investigate the effect of IFN-\u03b3 on adult rat cardiomyocytes cultured for 24 hours. They found that IFN-\u03b3 (2 ng/mL) induced increased transcription of both \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (MHC) and \u03b1-MHC to a level equal to that achieved with IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. In contrast with this, Jin et al. [22] found that IFN-\u03b3 (500 U/mL) prevented prostaglandin F2\u03b1-induced increases in width in cardiomyocytes isolated from rat hearts. Similarly, treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with IFN-\u03b3 (200 U/mL) resulted in a decrease in area (~26%) of these cells [27] . This was concurrent with equivalent decreases in \u03b1and \u03b2-MHC isoforms. Thus, similar to the whole animal experiments, the effects of IFN-\u03b3 on cardiomyocytes are conflicting and may differ depending on the source of the cardiomyocytes and concentration of IFN-\u03b3.",

            "text": "Cardiac fibroblasts are the cells responsible for maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the heart, and their activation is essential to the formation of scars and fibrosis in the damaged or stressed myocardium. The effects of IFN-\u03b3 on these cells are summarized in Table 2 . In the study mentioned in section 3.1, Han et al. [16] found that \u03b1-SMA + cells were decreased in number in the hearts of IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice infused with angiotensin II. While this could be indicative of decreased proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the heart, it may also suggest a reduction in fibroblasts converting to the more active and contractile myofibroblast phenotype for which \u03b1-SMA is a marker. In one of the few studies of the direct effects of IFN-\u03b3 on cardiac fibroblasts, Hellkvist et al. [28] found that IFN-\u03b3 increased hyaluronan production, as well as induced proliferation of confluent cultures of isolated cardiac fibroblasts from rat hearts undergoing post-transplantation rejection. This is indicative of a more active phenotype. Interestingly, they also found that IFN-\u03b3 did not have the same effects on non-confluent or normal cardiac fibroblasts. IFN-\u03b3 also transiently increases phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 in cardiac fibroblasts, causing translocation of these transcription factors to the nucleus [29] . Peak activation occurred at 15 minutes for both. Unfortunately, neither of these studies looked at a comprehensive array of phenotypic or functional outcomes. Thus, there is still a need to know exactly what effects IFN-\u03b3 has on cardiac fibroblasts ability to synthesize collagen and other ECM products, whether IFN-\u03b3 stimulates the release of other pro-fibrotic mediators, and the intracellular pathways involved in these events. This may help resolve some of the conflicting findings related to the ECM, described in whole animals in section 3.1.",

Activation of the receptor by IFN-\u03b3 induces autophosphorylation of Jak2, which then phosphorylates Jak1. Jak1 in turn, phosphorylates the IFN-\u03b3 receptor complex [30] . This allows for subsequent phosphorylation of Stat1 at the C-terminus at Y701. Stat1 then dissociates from the IFN-\u03b3 receptor and enters the nucleus to bind to the promoter regions of IFN-\u03b3-inducible genes [30] . Jaks are non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and although Jak1 and Jak2 are prominent in cardiomyocytes [32] , most work in the heart has focused only on Jak 2. Whether Jak2 is pathological or protective is unclear, which is interesting given the requirement of Jak2 for Jak1 activation. Stat1 is known to be activated in cardiomyocytes by numerous stimuli including angiotenisin II, cardiotrophin-1, stretch, pressure overload, myocardial infarction and ischemia reperfusion and has been linked with cardiomyocyte apoptosis [33, 34] .

Consistent with this, we previously reported that ERK1/2 activity was up-regulated in fibroblasts isolated from SHR hearts, while p38 and JNK1/2 activity was not [36] . In terms of cardiac hypertrophy, the role of ERK1/2 is not clear [37] . ERK1/2 is activated in cardiomyocytes in response to a broad range of stimuli, including cytokines, and constitutive activation of ERK1/2 induces myocardial hypertrophy consisting of a thicker septum and left ventricular posterior wall. However, this model has been criticized as being non-physiological due to the fact that under normal circumstances ERK1/2 activation is cyclical [37] . Deletion of the gene for dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), the phosphatase that inactivates ERK1/2, leads to increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and an increase in heart size.

IFN-\u03b3 has the potential to regulate PKC function. There is evidence that IFN-\u03b3 signals through PKC isozymes in different cell types through mechanisms involving other signaling complexes. Incubation of both murine bone marrowderived mast cells and the human mast cell line (HMC-1) with IFN-\u03b3 (100 U) increased phosphorylation of PKC\u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms in addition to MAP kinases, Jak1/2 and Stat1 [43] . Inhibition of PKC prevented phosphorylation of p38 kinase and Stat1, as well as inhibiting NF-\u03baB and AP-1 activity. An important event in IFN-\u03b3 dependent gene transcription is phosphorylation of Stat1 on Ser727 and there is evidence that PKC isozymes modulate the cellular responses to IFN-\u03b3 by regulating Stat1 phosphorylation. In human promyelocytic leukemia cells, PKC\u03b4 appears to be responsible for Stat1 phosphorylation downstream of PI3 kinase based on pharmacological inhibition studies [44] . In rat mesangial cells, pharmacological inhibition studies identified PKC\u03b5 as being a critical isoform in mediating Stat1 phosphorylation and IFN-\u03b3 dependent gene expression [45, 46] . In monocytes, IFN-\u03b3 stimulation induces nuclear translocation of PKC-\u03b1 and PKC-\u03b2I (but not PKC-\u03b2II), which phosphorylate the transcription factor PU.1 to enhance gp91(phox) gene expression [47] .",

In IFN-\u03b3-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages, PI3K and p38 MAPK are required for PKC-\u03b1 translocation (independent of JAK2 activity), but phosphorylation of PKC-\u03b1 which is synonymous with activation, is independent of PI3K and p38 MAPK. Phosphorylation of Stat1 at Ser727 and IFN-\u03b3 induced gene expression required both PKC-\u03b1 and PI3K, suggesting the existence two distinct steps (activation and targeting) in the regulation of PKC-\u03b1 mediated gene expression in IFN-\u03b3 stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages [48] . Adding another level of complexity are studies showing mechanisms involved in the activation of PKC isozymes in response to IFN-\u03b3, may be occurring through integrin-mediated interactions. The regulation of PKC\u03b5 phosphorylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts by cell-matrix interactions is correlated with the changing responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3 [49] . These data illustrate that PKC mediated effects of IFN-\u03b3 are based on cell type with multiple mechanisms associated with the activation and targeting of the different isozymes. Indeed, PKC's play a central role in the development and progression of multiple forms of heart failure and have been extensively reviewed elsewhere [50] . Given the complexity of these signaling networks, attention has turned to the convergence of these pathways at the level of Stat 1 mediated gene expression and its role in propagating the effects of IFN-in ischemic, inflammatory and atherosclerosis induced in heart failure [51] [52] [53] [54] .",

This data is summarized in Table 3 . Rocha Rodrigues et al. [55] studied at autopsy, myocardial samples from 21 patients with chronic Chagas' Disease. The samples were divided into patients with chronic heart failure and patients with no clinical or pathological signs of heart failure. The authors found an increased mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate in subjects with heart failure, and a positive correlation between IFN-\u03b3-containing cells and heart failure (P=0.032). The number of IFN-\u03b3-containing cells was compared to the number of IL-4containing cells as an indicator of T cell phenotype. The number of IFN-\u03b3-containing cells was higher than the number of IL-4-containing cells (P=0.02), indicating a Th1 T cell response. Another study comparing mRNA taken from the free wall of the left ventricle of end stage heart failure patients with Chagas' disease cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic), found that while numerous IFN-\u03b3-induced genes were upregulated in Chagas' disease, two distinct IFN-\u03b3-induced genes were up-regulated in dilated cardiomyopathy [25] . The two genes were polyubiquitin UbC and mda-9. A study of 72 individuals with congestive heart failure secondary to non-ischemic disease (48 with dilated cardiomyopathy and 24 with hypertensive heart disease) [14] , none of whom were receiving statin therapy, found increased serum levels of IFN-\u03b3 compared to controls (92.69 v 66.41 pg/mL). Administration of atorvastatin at 10 mg/day for two weeks reduced serum IFN-\u03b3 levels; providing yet another possible mechanism by which statins are effective. An interesting study assessed IFN-\u03b3 levels in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy [56] . Peripartum cardiomyopathy is the onset of heart failure in previously healthy women between 1 month antepartum and 5 months post-delivery. Forster et al. found that most peripartum cardiomyopathy patients that showed improved cardiac function over the 6 month follow-up period had decreasing serum levels of IFN-\u03b3.",

While IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 and IFNGR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice show normal development including their immune system, they do show deficiencies in natural resistance to bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections [30] . This appears relevant to the human population where patients with mutations of the human IFNGR1 or IFNGR2 chains that render these receptors inactive, and have similar deficiencies in their immune responses to these infectious agents. Despite this down side of interfering with the IFN-\u03b3 system, of relevance to heart failure is that possession of the +874A allele in the IFN-\u03b3 gene has been associated with longevity in women [57] . This allele, which is a single nucleotide polymorphism from T to A, coincides with a putative NF-\u03baB binding site, possibly impacting NF-\u03baB regulated transcription of IFN-\u03b3 [57] . Thus, a dampened inflammatory response caused by an IFN-polymorphism, may not have major impacts on an individual's ability to fight infection, but may prevent an over activation of the immune system leading to diseases such as cardiovascular disease [30] . Interestingly, this allele was also associated with an increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome [58] . However, the +874A allele was associated with tuberculosis infection in patients [59] , indicating that it may have an effect on immune response.",

[60] demonstrated that the number of myocardial lesions could be reduced in mice infected with coxsackievirus B3 by IFN-\u03b2. Further, IFN-\u03b2 immunotherapy reduced CD8 + T cells in chronic myocarditis induced by cytomegalovirus in mice [61] . This is important because these are the principal cell type detected in this autoimmune disease. In the reciprocal experiment, deletion of IFN-\u03b2 in mice infected with coxsackievirus B3 resulted in increased infection as well as cardiomyocyte breakdown [62] . In humans, 6 months treatment of myocarditis patients with IFN-\u03b21a completely eliminated enterovirus and adenovirus [63] . Further, these patients had decreased inflammation, reduced heart size, improved ventricular function, and reduced symptoms of heart failure. Of note, myocarditis derived from parvovirus B19 and human herpes virus 6 does not respond as well to IFN-\u03b2 in terms of virus clearance, although patients do improve clinically [64] .",

Daliento et al. [66] reported two case studies in which administration of IFN-\u03b1 improved heart failure in patients suffering enterovirus-induced myocarditis. The first was a 65 year old male who had worsened clinically from New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to IV. The individual tested positive for enterovirus from myocardial biopsy. Following 12 months of IFN-\u03b1 therapy (in addition to the heart failure medication that the patient was already on), left ventricular end diastolic volume had decreased, ejection fraction had improved (from 28 to 40%), clinical status had improved (NYHA IV to II), and right ventricular biopsy showed complete resolution of inflammation. In the second example, a 37 year old male patient with no prior history of cardiovascular disease presented with congestive heart failure (NYHA III). Three months of heart failure medication (ACE inhibitors, digoxin, diuretics, and carvedilol) provided no improvement. PCR assessment was positive for enterovirus. Additional treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03b1 for 6 months did not improve cardiac dimension or function, however, clinical status did improve (NYHA Class II). Biopsy revealed no signs of active lymphocytic myocarditis and PCR demonstrated no myocardial enterovirus genome.",

            "text": "The evidence is clear that IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 are protective against myocarditis. Yamamoto et al. [67] , however, compared the effectiveness of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 treatment in encephalomyocarditis virus-induced myocarditis in mice. Interestingly, while IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 improved survival, IFN-\u03b3 prevented any deaths from occurring, and thus, was far more effective than IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Only IFN-\u03b3 was effective in reducing cardiac lesions in the infected mice. Similarly, a mouse model overexpressing IFN-\u03b3 in pancreatic \u03b2 cells was protected from developing myocarditis in response to coxsackievirus B3 [68] . Thus, in the situation where a pathogen is involved, IFN-\u03b3 may in fact have a protective function. However, as detailed, the role of IFN-\u03b3 in adverse myocardial remodeling and heart failure of nonpathogen etiology is far from clear. Figure 1 is a schematic summarizing the major research findings to date, highlighting a number of contradictory observations. IFN-\u03b3 has the potential to regulate a wide range of functions in the heart due to its transcriptional control over a large number of genes related to proliferation, migration and cytokine production. Evidence from a limited number of animal and human studies is contradictory in that it is unclear if IFN-\u03b3 is detrimental or protective in the development of heart failure. Certainly, studies in IFN-\u03b3 overexpressing mice strongly suggest a role for this cytokine in inflammatory cell recruitment, cytokine and chemokine production, and development of heart failure. However, mouse background strain may be important given the differences in underlying T cell phenotype in C57B/6 and BALB/c mice. Thus, we need further studies to determine if this is indeed a contributing factor that determines whether IFN-\u03b3 has adverse or protective effects on the heart. At the cellular level, the overall effect of IFN-\u03b3 on cardiac fibroblast phenotype and function, the mechanisms behind these effects, and the ultimate role of IFN-\u03b3 in heart failure is also not clear. At present the effects of IFN-\u03b3 on cardiomyocyte function is unclear due to discrepant findings possibly due to the type of cardiomyocyte studied and/or concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 used. Cytokine therapy is not a part of the standard treatment regime for heart failure. There is a need to identify novel cytokine candidates, thus, we would propose that a more thorough examination of IFN-\u03b3 and its effects on the heart are warranted for consideration as a future target for heart failure treatment. Schematic summarizing the beneficial and adverse effects attributed to IFN-\u03b3 in the heart. Adverse stimuli, such as myocarditis or hypertension, initiate the release of IFN-\u03b3 from inflammatory cells recruited into the heart. Multiple studies have concluded that IFN-\u03b3 initiates adverse effects on cardiac fibroblasts, leading to fibrosis, and cardiomyocytes, leading to hypertrophy. Other studies have alternatively found that IFN-\u03b3 exerts protective effects limiting cardiac hypertrophy. ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; MHC, myosin heavy chain. ",
