Tropical sprue has been recognized since the second or third century ad, when Aretaeus of Cappadocia reported on \"The Coeliac Affection\" and in India in the Charaka Samhita. 1 The first mention of sprue in the modern medical literature was in 1747, when Hillary emigrated from England to Barbados and published his observations on a prolonged tropical diarrheal disease in native islanders. The English term sprue is an adaptation from the Dutch sprouw, which was originally used to refer to persistent diarrheal disease in Holland (probably celiac disease). The term sprue first was used in 1880 by Manson for the persistent wasting diarrhea that occurred in tropical countries. 2 Knowledge about the cause or pathogenesis of sprue did not advance significantly until investigations were begun after recognized outbreaks during World War II. The distinction between celiac sprue and tropical sprue was not clear until the early 1970s.",

Tropical sprue has been identified most readily in Asia and the Caribbean islands, and there are isolated areas of particular risk within both hemispheres. Sprue is relatively common in the indigenous populations of Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba, but it is not seen in the rest of the Caribbean islands and is no longer recognized in Barbados. 3, 4 It is seen in northern South America, Venezuela, and Colombia but rarely in Central America or Mexico. It is less common than previously but remains on the Indian subcontinent, from the Himalayas to the south, and it has been recognized in Myanmar and the Philippines. [5] [6] [7] Infrequent cases of tropical sprue were documented in Africa until the 1970s; cases have been recognized in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and South Africa, and tropical sprue has developed in expatriates living in Nigeria. 8 There may be endemic foci of tropical sprue in the Middle East as well, with a spruelike illness recognized in Turkey.",

Children are thought to be relatively spared, although disease has been documented in all age groups. Very young children have not been found to have tropical sprue; this may represent a beneficial effect of breast-feeding. In studies of family outbreaks of tropical sprue in South India, even older children developed disease at a significantly lower rate than adults. 9 The reason for this is not clear. Persistent diarrhea develops in children more commonly in parts of the world where the environment is contaminated more heavily with potentially disease-causing microorganisms. 10 Tropical sprue may be one of the causes of prolonged diarrhea and wasting in this age group as well, but studies such as small bowel intubation and cultures or biopsy have shown conflicting results regarding the correlation of small bowel colonization with persistent diarrhea.",

Tropical sprue or malabsorption with jejunitis (tropical enteropathy) has been described in Peace Corps volunteers and has occurred sporadically in travelers. 11 Generally, tropical sprue develops in an expatriate who has lived for a prolonged time (6 months to 1 year) in an endemic area. Rare cases also have been described in shortterm travelers. Tropical sprue is also recognized in immigrants who leave endemic areas, although they may not complain of gastrointestinal symptoms until they have been out of the endemic area for a prolonged period. 12 These exposure data also suggest an infectious origin for tropical sprue.",

Whether tropical sprue is distinct from tropical or environmental enteropathy has never been clear; these syndromes may exist at the ends of the spectrum of a single disease, with sprue being the more advanced and symptomatic form of the more frequently asymptomatic environmental enteropathy. 1 Sequence-based microbial identification is an example of a significantly more sensitive technique that may be beneficial in elucidating intestinal microbiota as it contributes to the pathogenesis of tropical sprue and may clarify the relationship to environmental enteropathy. 1, 23 The fact that small bowel overgrowth, as it occurs spontaneously in a certain segment of the population in resource-limited countries or after an acute enteric infection, may precipitate a series of intestinal insults that proceed to full-blown tropical sprue in susceptible persons is at present the most likely explanation for the cause of tropical sprue. The predisposition for progression from intestinal insult to tropical sprue is less easy to explain. Malnutrition, whether generalized or presenting as specific micronutrient deficiencies, may be a predisposing factor, but is neither necessary nor sufficient, as shown by the occurrence of tropical sprue in apparently well-nourished military personnel and their dependents. Small bowel overgrowth may alter intestinal transit time and promote further overgrowth and intestinal stasis, but it cannot explain the initial colonization that induces the episode.",

Some factors that can affect the normal small bowel colonization process include gastric acidity, which controls the entry of viable organisms into the small bowel, and intestinal mucin glycoprotein, which contains receptors for, and specifically binds, a variety of bacteria within the small bowel lumen. 25 Bacterial binding to mucin is presumed to promote clearance of pathogenic organisms to protect the small bowel, but it may promote colonization by nonpathogenic organisms or promote small bowel colonization by pathogens when the mucin is damaged by malnutrition, an inflammatory process, or bacterial proteases or mucinases. Some loss of the protective mucin layer in tropical sprue is suggested by evidence that the bacteria visualized are often associated tightly within the mucosa rather than being free within the lumen of the gut. 2 Damage to the protective mucin layer may also permit epithelial cell damage by other small bowel antigens. The presence of free bile acids within the upper small bowel can alter intestinal bacterial growth rates and colonization, but bile acid concentrations have not been abnormal in patients with tropical sprue, and the bacterial organisms that have been cultured from patients with tropical sprue are not organisms that typically alter bile salt metabolism. 18 Intestinal immunologic dysfunction has been suggested as a factor that might predispose to abnormal bacterial colonization in tropical sprue. Patients with deficiencies of secretory immumoglobulin A (IgA) are subject to more frequent and severe bouts of enteric infections. In addition to secretory IgA, lymphoid tissue is present throughout the small bowel focally in Peyer patches and diffusely as mucosal lymphocytes. When small bowel lymphocytes were characterized in patients with tropical sprue and in control patients with irritable bowel syndrome in southern India, there was no difference in the number of IgA-producing, IgG-producing, or IgM-producing lymphocytes between the two groups. 26, 27 Patients with sprue had increased numbers of lymphocytes in the crypt epithelium, with a higher percentage of immunoblasts and a higher mitotic index. 28 These data can be interpreted as evidence that lymphoid activation does occur in tropical sprue, but that it is probably secondary to whatever primary process institutes the disease, rather than being an inciting process itself.",

Functional changes in the small bowel mirror the morphologic changes seen and are most prominent in the ileum and jejunum. In tropical sprue, the jejunum is It has also been postulated that dietary fat might play a role in tropical sprue. Similar to the permissive effect of protein ingestion in the pathogenesis of pig-bel, the intake of long-chain fatty acids has been studied as a potential causative factor for tropical sprue. 29 The seasonal epidemic occurrence of tropical sprue in Puerto Rico immediately follows a traditional holiday feast of pork, which is rich in long-chain fatty acids. 30 There are several mechanisms whereby these long-chain fatty acids might contribute to the production of clinical tropical sprue. Long-chain fatty acids can alter intestinal motility and delay intestinal transit time. Plasma levels of enteroglucagon and motilin are increased significantly in patients with tropical sprue; motilin slows gastric emptying, and enteroglucagon slows intestinal transit. 31 Recent studies have also demonstrated abnormalities in PYY and neurotensin after infusion of fat in some patients with sprue, which may contribute to altered motility and bacterial overgrowth. 32 Intubation studies have shown that intestinal infusions of fat increase plasma enteroglucagon levels and decrease intestinal motor activity. Fat within the gut lumen also inhibits the mucosal sodium-potassium fluxes and the magnesium adenosine triphosphatases, which can contribute to malabsorption of water and electrolytes in the intestine and raise the pH of the mucosal microenvironment. 29, 33 The elevated mucosal pH produced by intestinal fats also has been associated with increased growth of gram-negative bacteria in the lumen of the small bowel, and a switch to a high-fat diet has been associated with alterations in the intestinal microbiota. 34, 35 The elevation of mucosal pH and the presence of fatty acids within the lumen of the gut also may impair the ability of the intestine to absorb folate; folate deficiency may potentiate the intestinal dysfunction that precedes it. 36 Folate deficiency leads to a decreased number of gut epithelial cells, as assessed by DNA concentrations, and to villus atrophy. Additional structural alterations are seen in the intestine with folate deficiency, including crypt hypertrophy, villus blunting, and megaloblastic changes in the epithelial cells. These changes are nonspecific and are similar to those seen with vitamin B 12 deficiency, celiac disease, or tropical sprue. Functionally, the folate-deficient gut is less efficient in absorbing water, electrolytes, and carbohydrates than the normal small bowel. 37 It is likely that whatever the initial insult to the gut may be in tropical sprue, the resulting folate malabsorption and deficiency contribute to the further pathogenesis of disease ( Fig. 104-1) . anatomy of the bowel, predisposing to a blind loop syndrome, or any medications that could predispose to small bowel overgrowth. Social history, in addition to travel and exposures, should include questions relating to possible human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure because HIV infection is a major risk factor for the development of chronic diarrhea. 52 History pertaining to symptoms of specific nutrient deficiencies, such as night blindness secondary to malabsorption of vitamin A, would be expected only in prolonged disease. There are no diagnostic physical findings for tropical sprue. The physical examination should document presence or absence of fever, volume status by any orthostatic changes, body weight, evidence of weight loss such as temporal wasting, and presence or absence of significant lymphadenopathy or abdominal masses. Hyperactive bowel sounds may be the only pertinent abdominal finding. Signs of anemia, such as pallor, are notoriously nonspecific but can be sought. Signs of specific nutrient deficiencies may also be present on physical examination: Cheilosis, stomatitis, glossitis, rashes, dermatitis, koilonychia, muscle pain or weakness, peripheral neuropathy, or edema can suggest deficiencies of iron, zinc, vitamin B 12 , folate, vitamins D and E, or protein. Deficiencies of any of these nutrients could be present in tropical sprue because of malabsorption by the damaged small bowel.",

A more complete laboratory evaluation includes serum vitamin B 12 and red blood cell folate levels, serum carotene concentration, or, preferably, a 72-hour fecal fat determination.

Enhanced magnification endoscopy (EME) has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting villus atrophy than standard endoscopy and may assist in making a noninvasive diagnosis of sprue. In a study of 15 patients diagnosed with sprue by intestinal biopsy in Caracas, Venezuela, atrophy was demonstrated in 93% of patients by EME, whereas standard endoscopy was able to detect atrophy in only 20% of patients. 53 Documentation of abnormal transit time by small bowel follow-through or breath hydrogen testing, which also can imply bacterial overgrowth, suggests but is not diagnostic of tropical sprue. The differential diagnosis that must be considered in a patient with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and malabsorption, even in a clinical setting consistent with tropical sprue, should include giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, coccidiosis (Cystoisospora belli), capillariasis, strongyloidiasis, celiac sprue (gluten enteropathy), lymphoma, intestinal tuberculosis, blind loop syndrome, pancreatic tumors, Whipple's disease, and microsporidia-associated HIV enteropathy. If diagnosis remains obscure, biopsy is considered to be very sensitive and will allow the syndromes to be clearly differentiated. Celiac disease, or gluten enteropathy, can be more definitively diagnosed by sending antigliadin or antiendomysial antibodies.",

Combination therapy with tetracycline and folate seems to be most effective in symptom resolution and cure of diarrhea with promotion of weight gain. 54, 55 Treatment with 250 mg of tetracycline four times daily and 5 mg of folate daily for 1 month has been effective for travelers with tropical sprue, but therapy must be prolonged for 6 months or longer for residents of the tropics who have had long-term disease. Even with prolonged therapy, relapses have been seen in this population, although these may have been caused by reexposure to an infecting organism and represent recurrent rather than relapsing disease. 56 Reports have suggested that tropical sprue in the Caribbean is more amenable to therapy than sprue in India, but these studies are difficult to compare. 57 Poorly absorbed sulfa in a net secretory state, with active secretion of water, sodium, and chloride 41 ; however, glucose-linked absorption remains intact, as it does for many other secretory infectious diarrheal syndromes. 42 In tropical sprue, there is malabsorption of bile acids and vitamin B 12 in the ileum. Bile acid malabsorption leads to fat malabsorption and malabsorption of the fat-soluble vitamins D, A, K, and E. Brush border enzymes are decreased functionally and are less efficient in digesting and absorbing disaccharides, such as lactose. 43, 44 Xylose, glucose, and folate malabsorption occur, as does malabsorption of minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Amino acid malabsorption occurs; protein metabolism is complicated further by loss of albumin in the lumen of the damaged small bowel. 45 Most of the functional changes in tropical sprue may be related to small bowel mucosal damage represented by the morphologic changes seen, but the hormonal regulation of the gut is also dysfunctional in this disease. 46 Postprandial insulin and gastric inhibitory peptide are reduced in tropical sprue; enteroglucagon and motilin levels are increased. In chronic tropical sprue, gastric acid secretion and secretion of intrinsic factor may also be affected. Transit time through the small bowel is slowed, as measured by breath hydrogen testing. [47] [48] [49] In the few studies of colonic function in tropical sprue that have been done, the ability of the colon to absorb water is decreased in patients compared with controls. There is speculation that the dysfunction of colonic cells may be related to damage by excess fatty acids in the gut lumen or bacterial toxins or infection. Although there is physiologic confirmation of the ability of fatty acids to disturb the absorptive function of colonocytes and small bowel enterocytes, data suggesting that colonic infections are important in the pathogenesis of tropical sprue are lacking.",
