However, there has been an increasing awareness of dental lesions in toxicity studies, particularly as the teeth are visualized when the maxilla is examined histologically in inhalation studies. Study of the rodent dentition in inhalation studies has shown that spontaneous lesions of the dentition are quite common. In one laboratory, malformations (dental dysplasia) of the maxillary incisors were observed in 3% of female and 9% of male CD-I mice and 14.5% of female and 10.5% of Sprague-Dawley rats in 24 and 18 month inhalation studies respectively.^^ Unlike in humans, the rodent incisor continues to grow and differentiate throughout life and is renewed every 40-50 days. Located at the centre of the tooth is the vascular pulp. This is surrounded by proliferating ondotoblasts which form predentin which when calcified becomes dentin. Surrounding ameloblasts when induced by the presence of dentin produce the overlying enamel layer. It is these active cellular layers which can be modified or damaged by drugs, vitamin deficiencies, calcium, phosphate or magnesium deficiency, parathyroidectomy, hypophysectomy, hyperparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and fluorosis.^^ In the rat these odontogenic cells have been shown by immunocytochemistry to express high levels of parathyroid hormone-related peptide and its receptor.^'* Studies in genetically modified mice have shown that parathyroid hormone-related peptide, a member of the parathyroid hormone family, is important in normal tooth development as well as cartilage and a number of other tissues and organs.^^ Although in humans the mature dentition ceases to grow, in children the dentition is in a growth phase that starts in utero and lasts into the second decade. As increasing numbers of children survive malignant disease, damage to the mature dentition can occur as a result of cytotoxic therapy during childhood.",

It has been shown that vincristine, which interferes with the assembly of microtubules and reduces secretory activity in a number of cells including osteoblasts and chondroblasts, also effects dentine formation in the rat incisor. Two weeks following a single intravenous dose of vincristine to young adult rats, a faint incremental line in the dentine was shown to occur, probably a reflection of a direct effect of the drug on the dentinogenic tissue at the time of injection.^^'^^ At higher doses, focal niche-like or punchedout defects in dentine were also observed, expression of more severe injury to highly sensitive dentinogenic populations at the time of injection. The precise mechanism of damage is not fully understood although decreased secretion of dentine matrix by odontoblasts was demonstrated. Administration of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide or a single exposure to ionizing radiation also produces localized niche-like or punched out defects in the rat incisor.^^'^^ Anticonvulsant drugs may also produce changes in the dentition of humans and experimental animals. In humans, reported alterations include tooth root resorption, small teeth, delayed shedding of deciduous teeth and retarded eruption of permanent teeth, features similar to those found in hypoparathyroid or pseudohypoparathyroid conditions.^\"^ Tooth root alterations were also reported in a study in which young male Wistar rats were treated with diphenylhyantoin for one month.^^ Treated rats showed evidence of molar root resorption lacunae that penetrated the cementum and involved the dentine. The lacunae contained a dense infiltrate of cells contiguous with similar cells in the surrounding periodontal ligament. Changes were similar to those occurring in parathyroidectomized rats but not those in rats made hypocalcaemic with a calcium-deficient diet. It has therefore been suggested that the changes induced by diphenylhydantoin in rats are similar to those in pseudohypoparathyroidism in which resistance of tooth roots to resorption is reduced.^^ High circulating levels of parathyroid hormone-related peptide has also been shown to disrupt ondontoblastic cell function and normal tooth growth in the rat.^^ Discoloration of teeth and bone is a well-described adverse effect of tetracycline administration and it has also been reported in patients treated with the semisynthetic derivative, minocycline.^^ Interestingly, the ameloblastic epithelium of the enamel-forming tissues of growing incisors in Wistar rats treated with high doses of human recombinant epidermal growth factor developed hyperplasia. This was characterized by pseudostratification, increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia.^^ This finding is consistent with the presence of epidermal growth factor receptors in the cells of the enamel organ.^^ Administration of inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor also has been shown to alter tooth formation in the rat.^^ After several weeks' administration teeth become whitened and fractured. Histologically the teeth show reduced dentine formation with degeneration of ondotoblasts, presumably as a result of defective vascularization in a manner similar to that seen in the epiphyseal growth plate (see Chapter 5) .",

Secretory endpieces are composed of small or moderately sized cells with foamy cytoplasm and basophilic basal poles. The most striking feature is the presence of an additional duct segment interposed between the intercalated and striated ducts. This segment is lined by cylindrical epithelium with basal nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing secretory granules. This duct segment is termed the granular duct or granular convoluted tubule. The granules in these duct cells stain particularly well with the chromotropeaniline blue stain but also orange G and PAS.^^ These granular cells are of special interest because they contain a large number of heterologous biologically active peptides including nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, renin, and kallikrinins.^^\"^^ Epidermal growth factor is secreted in saliva and believed to promote wound healing. However, the precise physiological role of many of these peptides in salivary tissue remains uncertain. Epidermal growth factor was originally isolated from the mouse salivary gland where it was shown to produce premature eyelid opening and incisor eruption when injected into neonates. This not only led to the isolation of both epidermal growth factor but also its tyrosine kinase-active receptor.^^'^^ Testosterone, thyroxin and growth hormone have been shown to regulate the concentration of epidermal growth factor in the rat submandibular gland.^^ Moreover, testosterone is responsible for the male pattern of the gland, notably the larger volume of secretory tubules and cytoplasmic granules. Castration causes their regression and androgens their hypertrophy in castrated males and intact females.^^ Granular cells stain with antisera for epidermal growth factor.^^ The intracellular distribution of epidermal growth factor in acini and ducts has been confirmed in other species, including humans.^^ Study of the mouse submandibular gland has shown that both epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor are released into saliva following the administration of phenylephrine, sympathomimetic amine acting mainly on a receptors and isoprenaline (isoproterenol), a p adrenergic agent.^^ Immunohistochemical study also demonstrates that epidermal growth factor becomes depleted in mouse salivary tissue following administration of phenylephrine and similar agents.^^ Phenylephrine has been shown to cause marked secretory activity accompanied by loss of granules from granular cells, as well as loss of immune reactive carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme which participates both in membrane transport of bicarbonate ions into saliva and glandular secretion.^^ Morphological studies have shown that both acinar and granular tubular cells participate in this response to adrenergic agents. This is in contrast to the effects of pilocarpine, a cholinergic agent, which elicits the secretion of saliva deficient in serous proteins with little or none of the growth factors, as its effects are more limited to acinar cells.",

It is accompanied by inflammation of variable severity and chronicity in both glandular and connective tissue as well as degeneration and necrosis of duct epithelium (Figure 8 .1).

In mild cases, a scattering of acute inflammatory cells is seen in the intact squamous mucosa. Ulcers can be single or multiple and are characterized by loss of squamous epithelium, with a variable accumulation of neutrophils, mononuclear cells, cellular debris, fibrin and hair fragments in the ulcer crater ( Figure 8 .2). The inflammatory process may extend deeply into the stomach wall and be associated with intramural inflammation, oedema, endarteritis and fibrosis.

The life span of surface epithelium in the stomach of rats, mice and hamsters has been calculated to be about 3-4 days. Studies of cell cycle and DNA synthesis time in the proliferative zones in the stomach of rat, hamster and man have suggested that the generative cells in the isthmus undergo mitoses at about 30 hour intervals in rodents and 40 hour intervals in humans.^^^ Although this process of migration from the proliferating cell zone of the isthmus renews surface epithelial cells rapidly, cell migration to the lower parts of the gastric glands is much slower and more complex. Detailed studies have shown that undifferentiated cells in the region of the isthmus represent a common source for surface mucous cells and mucous neck cells.^^^ Studies in transgenic mice have shown that mature parietal cells influence the fate of other gastric epithelial cells because targeted degeneration of parietal cells is associated with loss of chief cells suggesting interactions between these cell populations in determining their differentiation.^^^'^^^ Labelling experiments in the hamster stomach have shown that both chief and parietal cells possess a similar but quite long life span of about 200 days.^^^'^^^ It has been suggested that the relative distribution of chief and parietal cells in the gastric gland represents an expression of their different migration patterns downwards from the proliferative zones in the isthmus.

These glycoproteins are high molecular weight compounds with large numbers of sugar chains attached to a polypeptide backbone by 0-glycosidic linkages between N-acetylgalactosamine and serine or threonine.^^^ The principal monosaccharides present are fucose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. Due to this extensive glycosylation, mucins have a filamentous conformation, which is often negatively charged. This is believed to be important in forming a protective barrier to the cell. However, this property is a twoedged sword because when opposing cells have specific receptors for mucins, adhesion may become the predominant factor.^^^ There are considerable regional variations in glycoprotein constituents in the gastrointestinal tract and these differences are probably related to physiological and functional factors. Furthermore, synthesis and secretion of glycoproteins alter with changes in cell differentiation. Alterations also occur in mucins in various inflammatory and neoplastic disease states as well as following administration of drugs and chemicals.^^^ Gastrointestinal mucins are usually stained using PAS and alcian blue as well as the high iron diamine technique for sulphated mucins. Terminal sugars or sugar sequences can be demonstrated histochemically by the use of labelled lectins, mostly plant proteins which combine non-enzymatically with particular sugar molecules.^^^\"^^^ When gastrointestinal mucins were studied in several species using histochemical techniques under uniform conditions, species differences were most obvious in the stomach and duodenum.^^^ Neutral mucins generally predominate in the stomach, contrasting with acid mucins in the small intestine, and sulphated mucins in the colon. In the stomach neutral mucins staining purple with the PAS/alcian blue stain, predominate in the surface and foveolar mucosa, whereas mucous neck cells and antral glands contain acidic mucins that stain blue with PAS/alcian blue procedure. Sulphated mucins, which stain black with the high iron diamine technique, are also found in the deep glandular mucosa of the antrum in rats, mice and humans.^^^'^^^'^^^ Extremely heterologous staining patterns are seen in the gastric mucosa with labelled lectins, each lectin staining different cell populations. ^^^'^^'^^",

Genome sequence analysis has shown that Helicobacter pylori has well developed sequences for motility, scavenging iron and DNA restriction and modification systems used by bacteria to degrade foreign DNA. The link between Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulceration has been related to increases in gastrin release, perhaps through bacterial products or cytokines released from activated lymphocytes.^^^ Although gastric pathology represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in humans following therapy with non-steroidal inflammatory agents, the mechanisms leading to injury are not fully understood. The theory that has gained widespread acceptance is that the ulcerogenic potential of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is related to their pharmacological activity. John Vane proposed that the ulcerogenic potential of these agents is largely a result of their ability to inhibit prostaglandin S3nithetase, thereby reducing the protective effects of prostaglandins.^^^ By inhibiting cyclooxygenase these agents not only reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines but also prostaglandin synthesis. Indeed, there is a good correlation between time and dose dependency of induced suppression of gastrointestinal prostaglandin synthesis and potential for peptic ulceration.^^^ Why this should lead to ulceration is less clear but it probably is a result of effects on several components of mucosal defence such as changes to the microcirculation, local irritation, impairment of repair and alterations to mucin or bicarbonate production.^^^'^^^ The discovery of two different forms of cyclooxygenase led to the development of drugs that preferentially inhibited the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) isoform based on the postulate that constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) protects gastric mucosa whereas the inducible isoform cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is responsible for inflammation and pain. Whilst the benefit of selective COX-2 inhibitors for protection of the gastrointestinal tract is generally accepted, the situation turns out to be far more complex than originally envisaged. Many different mediators have been shown to contribute to the resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to injury.^^^'^^^ Indeed, in some circumstances COX-2 produces a highly potent gastro-protective substance 15-R-lipoxin A4. Moreover, one of the most dramatic pharmaceutical events over recent years has been the withdrawal from the marketplace of certain of these selective COX-2 inhibitors, Vioxx^^ (rofecoxib) and Bextra^^ (valdecoxib) because of concerns over their cardiovascular safety and skin effects which have been shown in major clinical trials.^^^'^^^",

Although Helicobacter pylori can infect other species, most laboratory animals do not appear to develop the inflammatory response seen in primates.^^^ An exception appears to be the Mongolian gerbil, which is considered the model of choice in the study of gastritis, gastric ulcer and metaplasia in response to Helicobacter pylori infection.^^^ C57BL mice and some other strains also appear to develop similar alterations in response to Helicobacter felis.^^^ Gastric ulceration induced experimentally by stress by cold or restraint is a particularly well-studied phenomenon in rodents.^^^ There are differences in sensitivity to this form of stress among laboratory animals.

A study of different anti-inflammatory drugs administered to fasted Sprague-Dawley rats under identical conditions, suggested the drugs could be divided into three groups based on their profiles of gastrointestinal toxicity^^^ Immunological drugs and antiproliferative anticancer agents such as azathiaprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and D-penicillamine produced gastric mucosal haemorrhage whereas aspirin and related agents produced gastric mucosal haemorrhage and ulcers. The powerful non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and phenylbutazone produced gastric mucosal erosion and ulcers as well as small intestinal damage. However, novel targeted therapies for treatment of cancer may not fall into these simple categories. For example a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor which produced single cell necrosis in the intestine in treated rats, also produced cell damage (apoptosis) in the gastric glands of the fundus and pyloric regions most markedly in the basal zones and isthmus regions.^^^ Comparative single oral dose studies of several non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents at three different dose levels in the rat using histology evaluation and measurement of faecal blood loss with ^^Cr-labelled blood cells have also shown that different patterns of ulceration can be produced by different agents when administered under identical conditions.^^^ Single oral doses of some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including aspirin produced widespread superficial damage and desquamation of gastric epithelium with little or no inflammation at 6 hours following dosing which completely healed 2 weeks later. This damage was associated with transient faecal blood loss. By contrast, indomethacin and ibuprofen produced both gastric damage and circumscribed, penetrating ulcers along the mesenteric border of the jejunum and ileum. Furthermore, ulcers were still present after 2 weeks and were associated with prolonged or biphasic blood loss. Pharmacokinetic factors may also be important. Lipid solubility in the low pH environment of the stomach may influence local penetration into the mucosa.^^^ In addition, feeding conditions influence the distribution of erosions and ulcers in laboratory animals. In fasted rats, erosions due to indomethacin treatment are found in the body of the stomach whilst in conventionally fed rats they are most prominent in the small intestine. One detailed study showed that rats fed for one hour after a 24 hour fast and given a single dose of indomethacin within 2 hours of re-feeding developed erosions and ulcers in the antrum primarily along the lesser curvature. Indomethacin given to fasted rats produced erosions in the body mucosa.^^^ A further factor that needs to be kept in mind is that chronic administration of ulcerogenic compounds may produce quite different pathological appearances to those found following single dose administration. Administration of aspirin to rats for 4 weeks has been shown to stimulate epithelial proliferation of the gastric body but not antral mucosa, possibly by an effect on cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cyclic AMP) or through increasing the rate of epithelial exfoliation.^^^ Such a response may be the basis for increased resistance of the gastric mucosa to the chronic affects of these agents. It also may explain the tendency for ulcers to occur in the antrum following chronic administration of aspirin-like drugs as the proliferative response and presumably the adaptive potential appears less in this part of the gastric mucosa.",

For example, rats, dogs and mice all developed gastric or pyloric ulceration when treated with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, although the distal small intestine seemed to be more markedly affected.^^^ Interestingly, it has also been shown by immunocytochemistry that the distribution of COX-2 expression in interstitial cells (monocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells) of the lamina propria predominates in the distal ileum which has led to the suggestion that this might be a factor in the greater sensitivity of the ileum than the stomach to the ulcerogenic effects of COX-2 inhibition.^^^ Diuretics and some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists have been associated with the development of gastric erosions and ulceration when administered in high doses to laboratory animals (Figure 8 .3).^^'^^^ However, these effects appear related to the severe electrolyte disturbances produced by excessive doses of these drugs. This is perhaps analogous to the well-known association of gastrointestinal tract erosion and haemorrhage with uraemia. Dogs appear to have a particular predisposition to this effect. Microscopic examination may show that this form of ulceration is associated with deposition of basophilic ground substance and mineral in connective tissues and blood vessels in the mucosa.^^^ The vascular damage which may occur in laboratory animals treated with high doses of cardioactive drugs such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also occur in intramucosal blood vessels of the stomach and the inflammatory process can spill over into the glandular mucosa.^^ Infiltration of the stomach by lymphocytes in rats treated with human recombinant interleukin 2 without ulceration was reported as part of a multisystem involvement induced by this agent.^^^",

For instance, administration of the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor antagonist CI-988 to cynomolgus monkeys for periods of up to 13 weeks was associated with an initial phase of multifocal degeneration of gastric glands primarily in the fundus followed by diffuse reduction in the thickness of the glandular mucosa with little or no qualitative changes to the cell populations.^^^ Although bilateral vagotomy produces profound functional changes in the stomach, notably reduction of gastric acid secretion, morphological changes in the fundal mucosa are not marked either in experimental animals or in humans.^^^'^^^ Studies in the rat have shown that diffuse atrophy of the gastric glands characterized by a decrease in the number and size of parietal, chief and mucous cells occurs transiently following truncal vagotomy but histological features return to normal by about one month after surgery.^^^ By contrast, unilateral vagotomy in the rat leads to marked and persistent atrophy of the oxyntic zone on the denervated side. This is characterized histologically by reduced height of the mucosa and reduced numbers and staining intensity of argyrophil cells.^^^ It has been argued that this unilateral atrophy is due to the removal of the trophic action of the vagus. The lack of lasting atrophy after bilateral but not unilateral vagotomy has been explained by the subsequent rise in gastrin that occurs after bilateral vagotomy as a result of lack of acid feedback inhibition of gastrin release.^^^ Removal or reduction in extra-gastric trophic factors or hormones may also reduce the thickness of the gastric mucosa. This is has been demonstrated in the rat by hypophysectomy which causes a reduction in thickness of oxyntic and antral mucosa, compared with pair-fed controls. Although there was little or no change in pepticiparietal cell ratios, a significant decrease in cell volume and secretory activity of gastric glandular cells was demonstrated which suggested a widespread disturbance of synthesis and secretory mechanisms.^^^ Atrophic changes in the chief cells were observed in rats treated for 6 months with high doses of omeprazole, an inhibitor of acid secretion. The findings were considered to represent disuse atrophy secondary to the inhibition of acid secretion.^^^ Another inhibitor of gastric acid secretion, the tricyclic agent pirenzepin, also produced atrophy of the fundic mucosa of rats following 3 months but not one month of treatment.^^^ The atrophy was characterized by reduction in parietal cell numbers associated with lower numbers of gastrin-containing cells in the antrum, features unlike those following prolonged treatment with histamine H2-receptor antagonists.",

These nodules show little or no cellular pleomorphism or mitotic activity but clear evidence of submucosal infiltration without involvement of the muscularis externa was observed in some cases. The overall light microscopic features are similar to those of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumours reported in humans. The incidence of gastric carcinoids was reported to be as high as 40% in females in the high dose group but only a few cases observed in similarly treated males.3^0 '371 Electron microscopy of the altered argyophil cells confirmed the presence of electron-lucent, vesicular granules, frequently with small irregular dense cores characteristic of enterochromaffin cells of the stomach. Immunocytochemical study showed that these cells contained histidine decarboxylase, a normal enzyme in gastric enterchromaffin cells that produce and store histamine.^^^ Other findings reported in rats treated with omeprazole have been a proportional increase in the number and size of non-endocrine cells of the fundus, and an increase in the number and immunostaining properties of the antral gastrin-containing G cells and hypergastrinaemia.^^^'^^^'^^^ All functional and morphological changes following treatment for 60 days were fully reversible after 42 days' drug withdrawal. As a result of these treatment-related increases of these normally rare gastric carcinoids in the rat bioassay with omeprazole, clinical trials with this agent were suspended until it was agreed that the endocrine alterations were a result of prolonged drug-induced achlorhydria. It was postulated that omeprazole causes a prolonged inhibition of acid secretion in the rat which causes activation, and subsequently hyperplasia of antral gastrin cells and marked hypergastrinaemia. Hypergastrinaemia in turn stimulates enterochromaffin cells of the fundus, which in time results in enterochromaffin hyperplasia.^^^ This argument is supported by the fact that similar morphological findings are reported in chronic atrophic gastritis and other achlorhydric sites in humans and that antrectomy in the rat prevents the appearance of enterochromaffin hyperplasia following treatment with omeprazole.^^^\"^^^ Although mild dose-related gastric argyrophil cell hyperplasia was noted in dogs treated with omeprazole for one year, neoplasms of the stomach were not observed during this time period. Why mice developed neither argyrophil hyperplasia nor gastric carcinoids with a similar treatment regimen is not clear, as the mechanism of action of omeprazole is similar in rat, dog and mouse. However, as the duration of action of omeprazole was shorter in the mouse, it was postulated that sustained inhibition of gastric acid secretion over 24 hours is necessary to activate increased gastrin secretion from antral cells.^^^ It has also been suggested that the mouse possesses fewer gastric enterochromaffin cells than the rat and shows a much lower serum gastrin response to omeprazole treatment.^^^ Nevertheless, gastric neuroendocrine tumours have occasionally been reported to develop spontaneously in old laboratory mice where they can be a concern in carcinogenicity studies because of their association with raised gastrin levels.^^^ Duration of action or potency may also be the explanation for the lack of reports of carcinoid neoplasms in rats following inhibition of gastric acid secretion by the histamine H2 receptor blockers cimetidine and ranitidine. Neither of these drugs completely inhibits gastric acid secretion in the rat for 24 hours.^^^'^^^ However, whilst neoplasia has not been reported, mild gastric neuroendocrine hyperplasia has been described in cimetidine-treated rats.^^^ Moreover, the long-acting H2 receptor antagonist SKandF 93479 produced gastric carcinoid neoplasms when administered at a high dose (lOOOmg/kg) to rats for two years (see Figure 8 .5).^^^'^^^ Although this dose level of SKandF 93479 did not entirely suppress gastric acid secretion and control gastric pH over 24 hours, plasma gastrin levels remained elevated at three to four times control values over this period. In a 21 month oral carcinogenicity study in CD-I mice at the same dose level (lOOOmg/kg), a diffuse neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and multifocal glandular hyperplasia and neoplasia was also observed.^^^'^^^ Similarly, loxitidine, a potent, non-competitive, insurmountable histamine H2 antagonist produced hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells and carcinoid tumours in the gastric fundus of both rats and mice after two years' treatment in diet and drinking water, respectively.^^^'^^^ Other histamine antagonists BL-6341 and ICI 162846 have been reported to produce neuroendocrine neoplasms in the stomach of rats and rats and mice, respectively^^^'^^^ Drugs of other classes also cause hyperplasia of gastrin-containing cells. Immunocytochemical study using antigastrin antibody revealed increased gastrin cell numbers in the antral mucosa of dogs given high doses of adrenocorticosteroids for 4 weeks and these changes were accompanied by enhanced serum and tissue gastrin levels.^^^ These results suggest that corticosteroids have a trophic effect on gastrin-containing cells.",

This contrasts with the uptake of soluble antigens, which can be taken up by ordinary epithelial cells and transported in the circulation of the villi to be ultimately trapped in the spleen possibly to evoke an IgM/IgG response.'^^^ Understanding of these cellular and molecular characteristics is critical for the design of mucosal vaccines for pathogens that exploit this pathway. ^^^ Mucosal mast cells also appear to be involved in the immunological defence of the gastrointestinal tract. They respond by proliferation, migration and discharge of granules during nematode infestations.^^^ It has been shown in the rat that mucosal mast cells of the gut differ in several ways from connective tissue mast cells. These differences result in poor preservation of mast cells of the gut if the usual metachromatic staining techniques are employed for the demonstration of mast cells in tissue sections.^^^ Histochemical study suggests that mucosal mast cells differ from connective tissue mast cells by a lower degree of sulphation of glycosaminoglycans and different spatial relationships of protein and glycosaminoglycans in their granules. These cross hnk following formalin fixation in a way that is sufficient to prohibit cationic dye binding. These staining difficulties can be surmounted in tissues fixed in formaldehyde by staining in toluidine blue for prolonged periods of time (5-7 days), a procedure which allows adequate penetration of the toluidine blue molecule.^^^",

Vasconstriction may also result in intestinal ulceration. For example life-threatening gastrointestinal ulceration is reported as a result of cocaine abuse. Although gastrointestinal complications are less common than cardiac damage, cocaine abuse may induce mesenteric ischaemia as a result of vasoconstriction leading to gastric or intestinal ulceration and perforation of the entire wall.^^^'*^^ It appears that the abuse of the free base form of cocaine (crack) is more liable to produce more upper gastrointestinal intestinal damage than oral cocaine abuse which tends to induce more distal intestinal perforation.

DNA/RNA ratios remain largely unaltered.'^^^ No gross changes in villous shape have been reported after resection and the total number of crypts remains constant. Although increased intestinal uptake of substances from the bowel lumen occurs in hypertrophied segments per unit length of bowel, disaccharide and dipeptidase activities are normal or even decreased after resection, suggesting a comparative immaturity of cells in the residual mucosa. Functional adaptation therefore is largely achieved by a larger number of cells but their individual absorptive capacity is not increased.^^^ Increased numbers of specific goblet cell populations are also seen in hyperfunctional states. Following jejuno-ileal bypass operations in rats, increased numbers of PAS-positive goblet cells develop in the villi and crypts of the hyperfunctional segments of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum.^^^ Mucin histochemistry has shown that the goblet cells in the hyperfunctional segments contain increased sialomucins in the villi and crypts of the jejunum and ileum but not in the duodenum and increased sulphomucins in the distal ileal segment. As sialic acid conveys more viscoelastic properties to mucin, it has been suggested that the goblet cell change following intestinal bypass fulfils a protective function against the increased flow of gastrointestinal contents.^^^ A number of nutritional factors, particularly dietary fibre, have been shown to influence the proliferative characteristics of the small bowel mucosa. Carefully controlled studies in rats given different forms of dietary fibre have shown that the proliferative characteristics of the small intestine can be modified by both the quantity and the quality of the fibre. These different effects may be the result of differences in solubility, gel formation, water holding capacity, effect on transit time and ion exchange activity or bile acid adsorption of the different fibres. However, interactions between dietary constituents are complex. For instance, the histological effects in the rat small intestine after administration of 2% dietary cholestyramine, a non-absorbable ion exchange resin, has been shown to depend on interaction with other dietary factors.^^^ Administration of an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, 5a-cholest-8-(14)en-3(3-ol-15-one, to rats for up to 9 days was also shown to produce enlargement of the small intestine in a way that was morphologically similar to the changes found following intestinal bypass.^^^ The enlargement was most marked in the proximal segment of the small intestine and progressively diminished towards the ileo-caecal junction, sparing the stomach, caecum and colon. Histological examination and morphometric analysis revealed an increase in smooth muscle mass, lengthening of the villi as well as an increase in the depth and cellular proliferation in the crypts of Lieberkiihn without evidence of cell damage or fatty change. Like the changes following jejunal bypass procedures, there was also an increase in acid mucosubstances in the goblet cell population overlying the villous mucosa. The mechanism for this change in the rat was unclear, particularly as intestinal hyperplasia was not seen in baboons treated with this 15-ketosterol for long periods. However, it was suggested that it was an adaptive response, possibly related to inhibition of cholesterol metabolism and cholesterol absorption from the diet as the laboratory diet employed in the rat study was particularly low in cholesterol.",

Physical stimulation by distension or increased dietary bulk has long been known to be sufficient to initiate hyperplasia, including thickening of the muscle coats.^^^'^^^ One of the most clearly documented forms of compensatory hyperplasia is that which occurs as a response to surgical resection or bypass of a segment of the colon. Following resection of a segment of colon in rats it has been shown that the remaining proximal segment of the right side of the colon develops an increase in the thickness of the mucosa and the muscularis externa as well as enlargement of lymphoid aggregates.^^^ Microscopically, the mucosa of the right side of the colon appears uniformly thickened with accentuated folds, elongated mucosal glands and increased height of the surface columnar cells. The changes are marked up to 30 days following surgery but less pronounced after 72 days. It has also been shown that a significant increase in the mitotic index in the proximal segment occurs at seven days but by 14 days the mitotic index returns to normal. The distal, downstream segment shows little or no morphological change but rather a long-lived increase in mitotic activity. It was suggested that these differences were related to the different embryological origin of the segments.^^^ A similar form of uniform colonic hyperplasia affecting principally the caecal and right-sided colonic mucosa also occurs in rats following oral administration of sulphated dextrans of molecular weight of approximately 400 kDa (Figure 8.8) . Oral administration of a wide range of compounds such as raw and chemically modified starches, various dietary fibres, caramels, sugar alcohols (lactitol, sorbitol, mannitol, xylilol), lactose, a synthetic polydextrose, polyethylene glycol and magnesium sulphate to rats or hamsters has also been linked to an increase caecal size and colonic mucosal hyperplasia.^^^\"^^^ The characteristic histological appearance of the caecum following administration of these agents is lengthening of the mucosal glands which are lined by epithelium composed of increased numbers of enlarged epithelial cells (i.e. hypertrophy and hyperplasia) showing increased proliferative activity and more rapid incorporation of tritiated thymidine. In addition, mucosal and submucosal oedema has been reported in association with the administration of lactose and increased mucosal lymphoid aggregates following lactose or xylitol feeding. Morphometric analysis has shown that changes to the mucosa depend on the fibre type.^^^ There may also be an interaction between dietary fibre content and colonic microflora that influences mucosal growth, although the mechanism is unclear.^^^ As the increase in caecal size and mucosal hypertrophy appears generally related to the osmotic activity of the caecal contents in rodents treated with these agents, it has been postulated that the changes represent a physiological adaptation to increased osmotic forces, irrespective of the contributing compounds.^^^ Administration of high doses of laxatives has also been reported to produce mild colonic hyperplasia in laboratory rats, where it was argued to be exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect.^^^'^^^ Treatment of rodents with antibiotics also causes caecal enlargement or dilatation without significant histopathological changes, probably as a result of changes in caecal microflora. It has been suggested that the enlargement relates to accumulation of urea as a result of inhibition of bacterial ureases.^^^ However, histochemical studies of the intestinal mucosa of rats treated with neomycin have also shown treatment-related reductions in activities of NAD tetrazolium reductase, succinate dehydrogenase, esterase, alkaline and acid phosphatase in the distal ileum, suggesting that some antibiotics also posses the potential to directly influence absorption and metabolic functions of mucosal cells.^^^ Long term administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 and other prostaglandin E analogues to rats also produces thickening of the proximal colonic mucosa, although this is less marked than in the stomach and duodenum. ^^^'^^ As in the small intestine, administration of epidermal growth factor to rats and cynomolgus monkeys induces hyperplasia of the colonic mucosa characterized histologically by hyperplasia and increased mitotic activity of crypt cells and reduction in goblet cell numbers with an increase in crypt depth and a slight increase in the numbers of infiltrating neutrophils. ^^'^ In common with other epithelial surfaces, atypical hyperplasia is associated with the development of colonic cancer in both humans and laboratory animals. The early alterations observed in rats treated with colonic carcinogens are similar to those found in the immediate vicinity of human colorectal carcinomas. The changes are characterized by lengthening, dilatation and branching of glands. The epithelium lining these glands shows mucous cell hyperplasia (goblet cell hyperplasia). Goblet cells contain predominantly sialomucin instead of the normal sulphomucin.^^^'^^^'^^^ As lesions become more atypical, these dilated, branched glands become more complex and lined by epithelium that shows increasing pseudostratification and vesicular cell nuclei.^^^ In rats treated with the carcinogens azoxymethane or 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, crypts show diminution of mucus secretion, increased cytoplasmic basophilia, prominent, rounded or enlarged nuclei which show variable degrees of pseudostratification and which eventually develop into frankly invasive glands.^^^ Similar alterations occur in rats treated with azoxymethane and the non-genotoxic agent dextran sulphate.^^^ Note: Some compounds may induce qualitative and quantitative changes in mucin content in the colonic mucosa without marked morphological alterations. An example of this phenomenon was described in rats treated with reserpine for seven days. The colonic mucosa showed an increase in sulphomucin (high-iron diamine positive) containing goblet cells in the surface epithelium.^^^",
