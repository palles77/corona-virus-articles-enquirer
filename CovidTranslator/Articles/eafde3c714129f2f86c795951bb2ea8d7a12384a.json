We immortalized memory B cells from individuals after primary or secondary infection and analyzed anti-DENV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) thus generated. MAbs to envelope (E) protein domain III (DIII) were either serotype specific or cross-reactive and potently neutralized DENV infection. DI/DIIor viral membrane protein prM-reactive mAbs neutralized poorly and showed broad crossreactivity with the four DENV serotypes. All mAbs enhanced infection at subneutralizing concentrations. Three mAbs targeting distinct epitopes on the four DENV serotypes and engineered to prevent Fc\u03b3R binding did not enhance infection and neutralized DENV in vitro and in vivo as postexposure therapy in a mouse model of lethal DENV infection. Our findings reveal an unexpected degree of cross-reactivity in human antibodies against DENV and illustrate the potential for an antibody-based therapy to control severe dengue.",

            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus responsible for tens of millions of human cases of dengue annually, including 500,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths (Gibbons and Vaughn, 2002) , with an economic burden rivaling that of malaria. A primary infection is believed to provide effective, durable and possibly life-long protection against re-infection with the same serotype, but only short-term protection against other serotypes (Rothman, 2004) . Classical epidemiologic studies suggested that immunity to one of the four DENV serotypes can increase disease severity upon subsequent challenge with a different serotype leading, in some cases, to severe dengue, a disease characterized by plasma leakage and hemorrhagic manifestations (Halstead, 1970) . Poorly neutralizing crossreactive antibodies raised in response to a previous serotype are believed to contribute to pathogenesis of severe dengue by promoting virus entry via Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R) and infection of myeloid cells (Halstead, 2003) , leading to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. The role of antibodies in severe dengue is supported by epidemiological studies showing that infants with waning levels of maternal antibodies (age 6-9 months) are most vulnerable to severe DENV disease (Halstead et al., 2002; Nguyen et al., 2004) , and that serum from these infants enhances DENV infection in vitro (Chau et al., 2008; Kliks et al., 1988) . The difficulty of balancing immunity to the four serotypes and minimizing incomplete response and the risk of ADE are major hurdles in the development of a tetravalent vaccine against DENV (Whitehead et al., 2007) .",

The E protein is structurally conserved among flaviviruses and consists of three distinct domains. Domain I (DI) participates in the conformational changes required for viral entry and nucleocapsid escape from the endosomal compartment, domain II (DII) contains the fusion loop, and domain III (DIII) has been suggested to bind cellular receptors (Bhardwaj et al., 2001; Chin et al., 2007; Chu et al., 2005; Rey et al., 1995) . Partially mature virions also express varying levels of prM protein on their surface, which is normally cleaved by a furin-like cellular protease to generate the mature virion (Stadler et al., 1997) .",

DIII-reactive antibodies produced by mice immunized with virus and boosted with recombinant E protein are largely serotypespecific and do not neutralize all the genotypes within a given serotype (Shrestha et al., 2010) . The role of antibodies to DI/DII is less clear as they tend to be more cross-reactive and less potent in neutralization (Crill and Chang, 2004; Goncalvez et al., 2004; Oliphant et al., 2006) . Antibodies to prM generally have poor neutralizing and enhancing activity (Falconar, 1999; Huang et al., 2006) , although recent studies suggest that some anti-prM mAbs can augment infectivity of poorly infectious immature virions (Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010) . Antibodies against NS1, a secreted non-structural glycoprotein that is absent from the virion but expressed on the cell surface, can also protect against infection in vivo, through Fc\u03b3R-dependent and -independent mechanisms (Chung et al., 2006) , or possibly contribute to pathogenesis (Falconar, 2007; Lin et al., 2008) .",

In this study, we used an improved method of memory B cell immortalization (Traggiai et al., 2004) combined with a broad screening approach to isolate a large panel of DENV-reactive mAbs from human donors. MAbs that bound to DIII of the E protein potently neutralized DENV infection, although they also showed enhancing activity at lower concentrations. In contrast mAbs that bound to DI/DII of E protein or prM neutralized poorly, yet potently enhanced infection of Fc\u03b3R-bearing cells. Surprisingly, some of the human DIII-specific mAbs and all DI/DII-specific mAbs isolated from secondary infection showed a broad pattern of cross-reactivity with the four DENV serotypes. Based on an improved understanding of the functional humoral response against DENV, we produced a cocktail of three variant recombinant mAbs that neutralized all four DENV serotypes without causing immune enhancement in vitro and in vivo.",

The frequency of IgG + memory B cells reactive against DENV-infected cells, calculated from the number of positive cultures and the number of input cells after corrections for the efficiency of B cell immortalization, was high in all donors, ranging from 5.4% to 16% of IgG + memory B cells.

We therefore selected two mAbs with potent and complementary neutralizing activity: DV87.1 specific for DIII of DENV-1, \u22122 and \u22123 and DV22.3 specific for DI/DII of DENV-4. As a complement we selected a DI/DII-specific mAb (DV82.11) that neutralized with comparable efficiency all four DENV serotypes ( Figure 2A ). Cross-competition experiments were consistent with the notion that the target epitopes recognized by the three mAbs did not overlap ( Figure S1 ).

Unmodified or LALA variant mAbs were transferred into AG129 mice 24 hours prior to a sub-lethal infection with DENV-2 strain D2S10. Whereas mice receiving 5 \u00b5g of the mouse mAb 4G2 (panflavivirus, E DI/DII-specific), developed an enhanced, lethal D2S10 infection, mice receiving 1 or 5 \u00b5g of LALA mAb variants did not succumb to infection ( Figure 3A ; 1 or 5 \u00b5g DV87.1, LALA p<0.0253; 1 or 5 \u00b5g DV82.11 LALA, p<0.0455 as compared to 5 \u00b5g 4G2) or show signs of illness. In contrast, with one exception, all of the mice pretreated with 1 or 5 \u00b5g unmodified mAbs DV87.1 and DV82.11 showed enhanced lethal DENV infection, whereas 5 of 6 mice receiving PBS alone survived infection ( Figure 3A ). The ability of the unmodified mAbs to enhance DENV in mice was not affected by differences in the interaction between the human mAbs and the murine Fc\u03b3. Indeed, chimeric mAbs in which the human constant region (hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains) was replaced with the homologous murine Ig\u03b32a constant region enhanced DENV infection comparably in vitro and in vivo (data not shown).",

Our findings in humans agree with these observations, as the isolated DIII-specific mAbs were indeed the most potent in neutralizing DENV infection of Vero cells, with EC 50 values in the low ng/ml range. However, whereas mAbs produced by mice boosted with recombinant E protein could only neutralize a few genotypes within a given serotype (Shrestha et al., 2010) , the human mAbs to DIII showed considerable breadth, with some mAbs being able to neutralize three or even all four DENV serotypes. DI/DII-specific mAbs were less potent in viral neutralization and showed an even higher degree of cross-reactivity. Strikingly, analysis performed on a large number of culture supernatants showed that the fraction of DIII-and DI/DII-cross-reactive antibodies was considerably higher in secondary infections. For instance 44.1% of supernatants containing DIII-specific antibodies from Donor 12 (secondary DENV-1) cross-reacted with two, three or four DENV serotypes whereas 100% of DI/DII-specific mAbs from Donor 92 (secondary DENV-2) cross-reacted with comparable EC 50 values with all four DENV serotypes.",

Moreover, two recent studies described recombinant anti-WNV antibodies that were generated after phage display screening of scFv (V H -V L ) molecules (Gould et al., 2005; Throsby et al., 2006) , both of which observed immunodominance of DI/DII mAbs against WNV E protein.

A previous study reported the isolation of three human E protein-specific mAbs, two of which showed enhancing but not neutralizing activity (Schieffelin et al.) . More recently, Screaton and co-workers showed that prM-specific mAbs represent a major component of the human DENV-specific response and that these mAbs are highly cross-reactive and, even at high concentrations, do not neutralize infection but potently promote ADE (Dejnirattisai et al., 2010) . Consistent with these data, most of the prM-specific mAbs described in the present study were highly cross-reactive and showed ADE activity over a broad range of concentrations. The human studies together with previous studies on mouse anti-prM mAbs that neutralize infection weakly, if at all, while potently mediating ADE (Falconar, 1999; Henchal et al., 1985; Huang et al., 2006; Roehrig et al., 1998) suggest a potential role for this class of antibodies in enhancing DENV infection in humans. Recent studies in infants have also implicated anti-prM antibodies in the susceptibility of infants to severe dengue (Chau et al., 2009 ). It has also been proposed that anti-prM antibodies could enhance DENV propagation by enhancing the infectivity of immature, \"non-infectious\" virions (Rodenhuis-Zybert et al., 2010) . However, because the vast majority (>99%) of humans experiencing secondary DENV infection do not develop severe life-threatening disease, the DI/DII-specific antibodies or the less frequent highly neutralizing DIII-specific antibodies are likely protective, along with other components of the innate and adaptive immune system.",

In the absence of an effective DENV vaccine, passive immunotherapy with neutralizing antibodies may provide an alternative for the treatment of dengue. A post-exposure prophylaxis approach is currently being pursued for treatment of several viral diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rabies, hepatitis B and WNV (Marasco and Sui, 2007) . Humanized anti-DENV mAbs obtained from mice or primates engineered with mutations that prevent binding to FcR have been developed for this purpose (Balsitis et al., 2010; Goncalvez et al., 2007) , but fully human mAbs generated during a natural infection represent an attractive alternative with a reduced antigenicity and risk of autoreactivity. Here, we selected three potent human neutralizing mAbs as component of a cocktail capable of targeting two distinct epitopes on each of the four DENV serotypes and engineered them with two leucine to alanine mutations in the CH2 region that prevent binding to Fc\u03b3R while preserving binding to the neonatal FcRn (Hessell et al., 2007) . The LALA variants retained neutralizing activity, and when tested in vitro, failed to enhance DENV infection and inhibited enhancement elicited by polyclonal immune sera or appropriate concentrations of intact antibodies. When tested in vivo in a mouse model of lethal antibody-enhanced vascular leak syndrome, the LALA mAbs protected against lethal infection induced by DENV-immune serum as a postexposure therapeutic. Even though effector functions can enhance protective efficacy of anti-flavivirus antibodies (Chung et al., 2006; Mehlhop et al., 2009; Oliphant et al., 2005; Schlesinger et al., 1993) , they are not required for highly neutralizing antibodies. Thus, at least in mice, even after ADE is initiated, there is a time window in which neutralizing antibodies that lack the ability to enhance infection can still protect against lethal disease. These results are a foundation for further investigation to address whether antibody-based therapeutics can control severe DENV disease in humans.",

The data shown are representative of two independent experiments. n.d., not done. (+) OD values > 0.5. (\u2212) OD values < 0.5 or no neutralization at the highest concentration tested (5 or 10 \u00b5g/ml). See also Table S1 . Characterization of non-E-reactive mAbs. The table reports the phenotype of non-E-reactive mAbs, the donor from which the mAbs were isolated and the mAb isotype and light chain usage as determined by specific ELISA. Specificity was determined by staining of Vero cells infected with DENV and by Western blot assay or ELISA. The specificity of mAb DV34.4 was not assigned (n.a.). The mAb isotype and light chain usage were determined as described in Table 2 . Viral neutralization and enhancement assays were performed on Vero and K562 cells, respectively, using DENV-1-4 vaccine strains. Shown are EC 50 values of neutralization and range of mAb concentrations of infection enhancement. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments.",
