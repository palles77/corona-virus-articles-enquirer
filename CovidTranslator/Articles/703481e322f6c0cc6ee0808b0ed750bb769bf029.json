BoHV-1 either alone or in association with other respiratory cattle pathogens causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry. The aim of this work was to validate a guinea pig model as an alternative method to the current BoHV-1 vaccine potency testing in calves. Guinea pigs were immunized with two doses of vaccine, 21 days apart and sampled at 30 days post vaccination (dpv). BoHV-1 antibody (Ab) response to vaccination in guinea pigs, measured by ELISA and virus neutralization (VN), was statistically compared to the Ab response in cattle. The guinea pig model showed a dose-response relationship to the BoVH-1 antigen concentration in the vaccine and it was able to discriminate among vaccines containing 1 log 10 difference in its BoHV-1 concentration with very good repeatability and reproducibility (CV \u2264 20%). A regression analysis of the Ab titers obtained in guinea pigs and bovines at 30 and 60 dpv, respectively, allowed us to classify vaccines in three potency categories: \"very satisfactory\", \"satisfactory\" and \"unsatisfactory\". Bovines immunized with vaccines corresponding to each of these three categories were experimentally challenged with BoVH-1 virus, the level of protection, as measured by reduction of virus shedding and disease severity, correlated well with the vaccine category used. Data generated by 85 experiments, which included vaccination of calves and guinea pigs with 18 reference vaccines of known potency, 8 placebos and 18 commercial vaccines, was subjected to statistical analysis. Concordance analysis indicated almost perfect agreement between the model and the target species for Ab titers measured by ELISA and almost perfect to substantial agreement when Ab titers were measured by VN. Taken together these results indicate that the developed guinea pig model represents a novel and reliable tool to estimate batch-to-batch vaccine potency and to predict efficacy of killed BoHV-1 veterinary vaccines.",

In Argentina, due to regulatory restrictions, only killed vaccines can be used to prevent viral diseases in cattle. Several conventional combined inactivated vaccines containing BoHV-1 together with other viruses (bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine parainfluenza type 3 virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus) and bacterial pathogens (Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus sommi, Moraxella bovis, Moraxella ovis, Campylobacter fetus-fetus, Campylobacter fetus-venerealis and Leptospira sp.) have been used for many decades in routine vaccination protocols to prevent bovine respiratory and reproductive diseases in cattle. These multivalent vaccines were designed to control a sanitary problem of complex etiology. However, the potency and efficacy against each antigen contained in some of these combined formulations is unclear and further studies need to be carried out to properly address this issue.",

Bovine trials are cumbersome, expensive and time consuming, particularly, in countries like Argentina, where BoHV-1, as well as other viral infections are endemic [10, 12, 13] . The difficulty in finding seronegative bovines, from BoHV-1 free herds, to be used in vaccine potency tests, pose the need for the developing standardized and harmonized tests in laboratory animals.

Vaccination trials were conducted in 12 beef farms located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Herds without previous history of vaccination against BoHV-1 were selected. As BoHV-1 infection is endemic in Argentina, vaccines were evaluated in BoHV-1 seronegative animals from BoHV-1 free herds, and also in seronegative and seropositive calves from BoHV-1 endemic herds, in order to consider the variability of the real target population [1, 19] . In the trials conducted in BoHV-1 endemic farms, the number of positive and negative animals was randomly distributed in each treatment group so as to initiate the study with statistically similar pre-vaccination mean Ab titers and variances among groups. In every trial, bovines were vaccinated with two doses of vaccine, 30 days apart, as recommended in the label of each of the 22 commercial vaccines tested. Vaccines were administered by the subcutaneal route with doses of 5 or 3 ml according to manufacturers\u01d0 recommendations. Vaccine formulated for model validation and named as \"reference vaccines\" were applied following same time intervals and dose volumes as commercial vaccines. Blood samples for serum extraction were collected by puncture of the jugular or coccygeal vein. Animals were sampled at 0, 30 and 60 days post-vaccination (dpv). Control groups included placebo and non-vaccinated animals. Groups of calves that received two doses of placebo formulated with culture media (without virus) emulsified in oil-adjuvant were assayed in eight occasions including the dose-response trials in which the animals were sampled until 90 dpv. In addition, in order to have vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups exposed to similar natural conditions, a group of non-vaccinated calves was included in every bovine trial conducted in each of the 12 farms that participated in this study. A bovine trial was only considered valid and included in the statistical analysis if no seroconversion was detected in the non-vaccinated and placebo control groups. Most experiments were carried out blinded (veterinarian, laboratory technician). Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold increase in antibody titer for both ELISA and VN.",

Briefly, bovine and guinea pig serum samples were heat inactivated at 56 \u2022 C for 30 min. Four replicates of serial 4-fold dilutions of each sample (1:4 to 1:1024) prepared in 96 well plates were mixed with an equal volume of the BoHV-1 reference strain Los Angeles, containing tissue culture infectious doses 50% (TCID 50 ), and leading to a final neutralization stage 1:8 to 1:2048 [9] . An extra sample replicate without virus was used to evaluate the potential toxicity of the serum on the cells. Positive and negative control sera of known Ab titer to BoHV-1 were also included in each assay as internal reference controls. Bovine reference samples were derived from naturally infected, vaccinated and experimentally challenged calves, as previously described [22, 23] . Guinea pig reference samples were obtained from naturally seronegative and vaccined animals, as detailed elsewhere [24] . Serum-virus mixtures were incubated during 1 h at 37 \u2022 C, and then, 100 l of Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell suspension containing between 200,000 \u00b1 50,000 cells was added. After 3 days incubation at 37 \u2022 C, plates were read microscopically for cyto-pathogenic effect (CPE). The test was considered valid if checking back titration of virus gave an infectious titer of 100 (TCID 50 ) with an acceptance range of 50-200 TCID 50 . The positive control should give its expected titer \u00b1 1SD, the negative serum should give no neutralization (monolayer with CPE) and the monolayer of control cells (cells plus culture medium, without serum and without virus) should be intact. Virus neutralizing Ab titers were calculated by Reed and Muench method [25] . Negative serum samples received the arbitrary value of 0.30 for calculation purposes.",

The antibody titer of each sample was expressed as the log 10 of the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution with a corrected optical density OD 405c (OD 405 in the positive coated wells minus OD 405 in the negative coated wells) greater than the cut off values of the assay (40% PP for both species). ELISA results were normalized by expressing the corrected OD values as the percentage of a single high-positive control serum (PP%) included in each plate, in every ELISA run.

Viral antigens were inactivated using binary ethylenimine (BEI) [29] and vaccines were formulated using a pilot scale equipment. The adjuvant used in the formulation consisted in a mix of 0.67% Polisorbate 80, 2.1% Sorbitan 80 Monooleate and 57.9% mineral oil, in a 60:40 oil:water proportion. Each vaccine set was formulated with a different dilution of the same bulk of antigen that was previously diluted or concentrated in order to obtain the desired Ag concentration and the vaccine was formulated thereafter. These vaccines of known antigen concentration are referred to as \"reference vaccines\" and were used to estimate the dose-response calibration curve in bovine calves and guinea pigs. Each set of reference vaccines was tested in two independent experiments in guinea pigs and two independent trials in bovine calves (Table 1) . Antibody responses were determined by VN, and the validated ELISAs. In the initial stage of development, samples were taken at different time points and the kinetic of the antibody response (mean ELISA and VN antibody titers) induced by these first set of reference vaccines (calibration vaccines) were evaluated until 60 dpv in guinea pigs and 90 dpv in calves. In all cases vaccines were administered in parallel, in groups of a minimum of 5 guinea pigs and 5 bovines.

The curves of the kinetic of the antibody response to BoHV-1 after vaccination in both species were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures and Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons [31] . This analysis allowed determining the earliest time point, for animal sampling, corresponding to the peak or plateau Ab titer that also showed acceptable discriminatory capacity. In a second stage of validation, at the time points selected in the previous stage, the ability of the laboratory animal model and bovine calves to significantly discriminate among vaccines formulated with antigen concentrations of 1 log 10 difference was evaluated. At this stage the minimal antigen concentration inducing a detectable Ab response by ELISA and VN was determined (detection limit or minimal immunogenicity dose). Each individual assay/trial using a group of 5 animals was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by DGC multiple comparison test [32] . Kruskal Wallis non-parametric rank sum test [33] was used when the assumptions of normality and/or homoscedasticity were not met. The control groups (non-vaccinated and placebo groups) were not considered in the analysis when all the animals of these groups remained seronegatives throughout the experience (variance equal zero).

            "text": "Specifically for BoHV-1 killed vaccines, international regulatory policies [1, 11] recommend to evaluate vaccine quality in a potency test conducted in seronegative bovine calves. Briefly, the first batch of virus inactivated BoHV-1 vaccine should be tested in five calves susceptible to IBR infection (negative for neutralizing antibodies to BoHV-1). Calves are vaccinated following the manufacturer's recommendations (typically 2 doses, 30 days apart), while three animals should be left as non-vaccinated controls. Fourteen days after the second dose of vaccine at least 4 out of 5 vaccinated calves should develop virus neutralizing Ab titers of 1:8 or higher. Vaccines not reaching this potency requirement should undergo a challenge test by intranasal route. Two out of three control calves should develop hyperthermia and clinical signs of IBR, while only one of the vaccinated calves may develop clinical signs, otherwise the vaccine batch is considered of poor quality [11] . After experimental challenge, the OIE also requests the vaccine to reduce nasal virus shedding at least 100 times and virus excretion period in 3 days compared to control calves [1] . Thus, for the release to the market, a BoHV-1 vaccine must prevent the development of severe clinical signs and markedly reduce virus shedding after experimental challenge. Tests conducted in calves are expensive and time consuming to be used as a routine test for vaccine batch release, more so in countries like Argentina and other South American countries like Brazil and Uruguay where BoHV-1 and 5 infections are endemic [4, 6, 7, 10, 12] . In such regions finding seronegative bovines from BoHV-1 free herds, is becoming increasingly difficult. The use of a serologic test in guinea pigs, naturally seronegative for the BoHV-1 and 5, represents a convenient alternative method to evaluate batch-to-batch vaccine potency, which is in alignment with the 3R initiative of refining, reducing and replacing animal experimentation [15, 16] .",

Under the conditions use, the minimum dose of antigen capable to induce detectable Ab response (detection limit or minimum immunogenicity dose) was in the order of 10 6 TCID 50 /dose of inactivated BoHV-1 in waterin-oil formulation, in both species as measured by VN and ELISA. The quadratic term of the mathematical equation obtained by lin-ear regression analysis reflected the kinetic of antibody response, indicating that above certain Ab titer the Ab response can not be improved by the addition of higher doses of antigen [40] . The guinea pig model was able to significantly discriminate between vaccines formulated with Ag concentrations differing in 1 log 10 and showed very good repeatability and reproducibility as recommended by the international guidelines [19] . It is important to highlight that the choice to test vaccines formulated with BoHV-1 antigen concentrations differing in 10-fold scale was based on preliminary data which indicated that no discrimination was observed between vaccine formulations having antigen concentrations within the same order of magnitude. This observation might be related to the fact that the infectious titer of the virus antigens used in the vaccine formulation as well as the virus used in the VN assay are conducted using 10-fold dilutions [38] .",

The classification of a vaccine as \"satisfactory\" or \"very satisfac-tory\" when it is actually unsatisfactory and fails to protect cattle represents a risk for the livestock producers.
