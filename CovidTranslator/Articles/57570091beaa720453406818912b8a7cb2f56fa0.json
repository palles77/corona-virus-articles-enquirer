LC16m8, an attenuated, replicating smallpox vaccine derived from the Lister strain of vaccinia, is currently licensed in Japan where it was safely used in over 50,000 children in the 1970s. It has been shown to have markedly less neurotoxicity than unattenuated vaccines in nonclinical studies. LC16m8 is immunogenic after a single dose, and recent studies in two different animal models have demonstrated protective efficacy equivalent to that of the only FDAlicensed smallpox vaccine. This article reviews the history and available scientific literature regarding LC16m8 and provides comparisons to other smallpox vaccines.",

Officials in countries with a low incidence of smallpox were particularly alarmed by the morbidity and mortality associated with postvaccination encephalitis and encephalopathy. While central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions were generally considered idiosyncratic events, the incidence seemed to vary by strain of vaccinia. This observation was eventually substantiated when the Marennikova group of the Viral Pharmaceutical Institute in Russia published animal data that characterized over 20 commonly used strains of vaccinia and showed a correlation between the degree of pathogenicity and viral replication in CNS and other tissues [1, 2] . According to the 1969 Marennikova report, the Ikeda strain of vaccinia was classified as having high pathogenicity, whereas the Lister strain used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UK National Health Service (NHS) was rated as hav-ing medium pathogenicity, and the New York City Board of Health strain (NYCBH, also manufactured under the trade name Dryvax \u00ae ) used in the US was rated as having low pathogenicity.",

The highest risk of mortality was in primary vaccinees, particularly in infants. As one of its first tasks, the SVRG investigated the CNS toxicity of several strains of vaccinia in mice that were inoculated intracerebrally [5] . The results from the mouse studies confirmed the greater neurotoxicity of the Ikeda strain reported by Marennikova and spawned several clinical trials in children comparing Ikeda with Lister and EM-63, a strain used in Russia. 0264 After collecting data from several thousand primary vaccinees, it was found that all of the studied vaccines induced similar take rates, antibody responses, and febrile reactions, but that Lister had the mildest local reactogenicity. While no direct conclusions could be made regarding the relative neurotoxicity of the studied vaccines, local reactogenicity was at that time regarded as an indicator of overall vaccinia toxicity, and was used to identify Lister as the safest vaccine strain in the trials [5] .",

The attenuated CVI-78 strain (CVI after 78 passages), developed by Kempe et al. at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the late 1940s, was ultimately selected for development based on the mild dermatologic reactions it produced in rabbit and human studies [14] . Similar results were seen during numerous clinical studies where only mild local reactogenicity and fevers without serious adverse reactions were observed [3, 13, 14] . Additionally, CVI-78 appeared to offer a major advantage for dermatologically compromised individuals as Kempe et al. confirmed the safety of this vaccine in children with eczema [14] . Nevertheless, two critical findings dampened enthusiasm for the CVI-78 vaccine. First, the neurotoxicity of CVI-78 following intracerebral inoculation of monkeys was shown to exceed that of the unattenuated Ikeda, Lister, and NYCBH strains, suggesting a greater human risk for encephalitis with CVI-78 [15] . Second, it was found that the immune response to CVI-78, particularly the neutralizing antibody response, was low when compared to unattenuated Lister or Ikeda strains, calling into question the protective efficacy of this vaccine [2, 16, 17] .",

Japanese public health officials hoped that, by varying the interval between the primary and challenge vaccinations in this substudy and monitoring cutaneous effects, they would be able to gain insight on the speed with which the primary attenuated vaccine elicited an immune response as well as the robustness and longevity of that response. As shown in Table 4 , cross-protective immunity against Lister challenge vaccination was induced early and in the vast majority of vaccinees (\u223c80%) [4, 21] . Findings with LC16m8 were comparable to Ikeda/Dairen results [4] . Takeuchi reported that when children (1-4 year olds) were vaccinated with LC16m8 and challenge-inoculated with Lister 10 days later, only 1/224 developed a small pustule; the remaining children had either no detectable reaction (54.5%), or redness/induration or scab at the vaccination site [21] . These findings suggested that cross-protection against other poxviruses, such as variola, could be mounted quickly following LC16m8 primary vaccination, and be maintained with little variation during the first year post-LC16m8 vaccination (the longest timepoint studied). However, other studies have shown that protection against a primary reaction following revaccination, although proposed historically for this purpose [24] , is not a definitive measure of likely protective efficacy [25, 26] . The relevance of a cutaneous reaction upon revaccination is therefore unclear.",

Recombinant studies, in which the HindIII D fragment of Lister has been introduced into the LC16m8 strain, have shown that a part of the genome containing the extra XhoI is responsible for small plaque and pock size, and restricted growth in Vero cells [30] . The gene in this fragment, originally called ps/hr for plaque size/host range, and now identified as B5R, is related to the regulator of complement activation (RCA) gene family in mammals that contain the characteristic short consensus repeat (SCR) domains (Fig. 2 ) [30, 31] . Recent analysis of the full sequence of the Lister, LC16mO, and LC16m8 genomes confirmed the 1-base deletion in the B5R gene of LC16m8, which introduces a stop codon within the gene [33] . As a result, while the full-length B5R gene encodes for a 317-residue protein, the altered gene in LC16m8 theoretically would encode for a 92-residue protein that, if processed correctly, would be secreted from infected cells as a 73-residue protein.",

B5R is also a target for neutralizing antibodies [36] , and anti-B5R antibodies have been shown to protect mice against lethal infection [37] . Yet recent lethal poxvirus challenge studies in rabbits and mice [33, 38] demonstrated that a deletion in the B5R gene does not diminish LC16m8's efficacy or its ability to induce EEV antibodies. A primate study [39] also suggested that the B5R protein is not critical for smallpox vaccine efficacy. Hooper et al. were able to show that a Dryvax-vaccinated monkey with no detectable B5R-specific neutralizing antibodies could survive a lethal monkeypox virus challenge. The serum of this particular monkey was able to neutralize monkeypox and the vv-Connaught vaccine strain (derived from the NYCBH strain) in PRNT assays. It is possible that the protection conferred by LC16m8 is B5R-independent and other EEV surface proteins may serve as epitopes for neutralizing antibodies [37, 39, 40] . There is also evidence that smallpox vaccines induce cell-mediated immunity (CMI) [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Hence it is possible that neutralizing epitopes on the truncated B5R protein might contribute to the overall protective immune response without being the primary mediator.",

This plaque-size heterogeneity can be mapped to the B5R gene where some variants exhibit point mutations upstream of the known B5R single-base deletion. These compensatory mutations correct the observed frameshift and lead to the reconstitution of a full-length B5R gene. Western blot analysis has confirmed a restored ability of these variants to produce a full-length B5R protein. In a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse LD 50 study, the pathogenicity of two revertant viruses and the LC16mO precursor strain was similar. In addition, plaque-purified LC16m8 and a construct of LC16m8 lacking the B5R gene were shown to have safety profiles comparable to that of MVA in the same animal models and to confer protective immunity in a mouse/intranasal vaccinia (Western Reserve [WR] strain) challenge study [47] .",

LC16mO and LC16m8 are attractive options for live rVVs because they are characterized by temperature sensitivity, restricted host range, and infrequent low-grade adverse events. Moreover, LC16mO has been found to be more immunogenic than its unattenuated parent, Lister, and LC16m8, so it has generally been the preferred vector system [53] .

A recent abstract [54] showed particularly promising results for an LC16m8-vectored SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) vaccine. It was observed that neutralizing antibody titers to the SARS-CoV spike protein increased 100-fold 1 week after vaccination and increased an additional 10-fold 2 weeks after a booster injection. Interestingly, rabbits with preexisting antibodies to the vector (after being pre-immunized with LC16m8) still generated an antibody response, suggesting that this vector system might produce vaccines suitable for populations that have undergone prior immunization with smallpox vaccine(s).",

These included basic antibody and T-cell assays and monitoring of cutaneous responses to primary vaccination with LC16m8 [4] . However, current standards for determining vaccinia efficacy rely on more sophisticated measurements of humoral and CMI responses as well as lethal poxvirus challenges in vaccinated animal models [41, 42, 67, 68] . One example of the latter is the lethal rabbitpox virus (RPXV) in rabbits, which mimics smallpox infection in humans [69] since it is rapidly and widely disseminated, is highly infectious, and produces high levels of EEV. The latter appears to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of both RPXV and variola [34, 70] , making the RPXV challenge model particularly suitable for testing the EEV-neutralizing capability of LC16m8. Hence, the protective efficacy of LC16m8 was recently evaluated in the rabbit model using a RPXV challenge [38] .",

Antibodies from the LC16m8vaccinated rabbits had a greater capacity to bind RPXV in an ELISA (data not shown) as well as neutralize RPXV IMV when compared to antibodies from Dryvax-vaccinated rabbits (Fig. 4) . Interestingly, antibodies from LC16m8-and Dryvax-vaccinated animals showed comparable abilities to neutralize RPXV EEV. Fig. 4 . Antibody responses to LC16m8 and Dryvax in rabbits. Sera obtained from rabbits 14 and 28 days after immunization were tested at a 1:10 dilution for neutralization of IMV and EEV forms of RPV by plaque-reduction assays.

IMV neutralization titers elicited by LC16m8 were significantly greater than those elicited by Dryvax (p < 0.001, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). Sera obtained from PBS-immunized animals demonstrated no neutralization. These data are not shown. Finally, a plaquing virus assay used to measure virus in different tissues showed there was no detectable RPXV in the lung, liver, or spleen of both groups of vaccinated animals, whereas placebo animals had high titers of virus in these organs.",

Although well proven with regard to protective efficacy against smallpox, a first-generation vaccine such as Dryvax may produce rates of local and systemic adverse reactions that are unacceptable in a post-endemic smallpox era, particularly given the higher rates of immunosuppression and skin disease in today's population. Common reactions to Dryvax include fever, lymphadenopathy, and lymphadenitis, while more serious adverse events include auto/contact inoculation, generalized vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, and encephalitis [77] .

The quality, progression, and timing of pock reactions were similar to those seen with Dryvax controls, as were most local and systemic reactions. Apart from local reactions at the injection site, the most common adverse reaction to ACAM1000 or ACAM2000 was lymph node or axillary pain (seen in 67-73% of primary vaccinees) [75] . Unfortunately, subclinical or overt myopericarditis was also found to occur at high rates in both the ACAM2000 and Dryvax control groups [79, 80] . In addition, one vaccinee given the experimental vaccine experienced a new onset seizure 8 days postvaccination [75] . In another recent Phase II study, myopericarditis developed in one subject 10 days after vaccination with 6.8 \u00d7 10 7 pfu/mL of ACAM2000 [83] .",

In addition, Hammarlund and colleagues recently reported that smallpox vaccination as much as 48 years pre-exposure conferred immunity to humans exposed to monkeypox [101] . No data on the duration of long-term immunity to LC16m8 are currently available, however, immunity duration will be an important consideration for all new smallpox vaccine candidates.",
