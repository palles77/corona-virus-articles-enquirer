            "text": "Recently, dendrimer-like DNA (DL-DNA) nanostructures have been synthesized by our group 14 . The multivalent and anisotropic properties of DL-DNA were used here as fluorescent dye carriers (that is, scaffoldings) to construct fluorescence-intensity-encoded nanobarcodes. We first synthesized fluorescence-labeled Y-shaped DNA (Y-DNA), where each Y-DNA consisted of three oligonucleotide components that were complementary to each other. One of the oligonucleotides had a sticky end, and the other two were labeled with either fluorophore(s) or a molecular probe. After hybridization, these oligonucleotides formed a fluorescence-labeled Y-DNA (Fig. 1a) that was used as a peripheral outermost layer of DL-DNA to construct fluorescence-labeled DNA nanostructures. Since both dye type and dye number can be precisely controlled, multicolor fluorescenceintensity-encoded nanobarcodes could be fabricated (Fig. 1b) . The decoding is based on the different ratios of different fluorescent dyes, independent of the dye positions (Fig. 1c) . During the construction of DNA nanobarcodes, molecular probes were linked to the free reactive ends of DL-DNA. A myriad of DNA-manipulation enzyme tools 15 makes it very easy to attach molecular probes (e.g., DNA or RNA probes, or even antibodies) to DNA nanobarcodes. Consequently, the resultant DNA nanobarcodes not only had coding capacity, but also contained molecular recognition elements that could be used for molecular detection.",

            "text": "The diameter of DNA nanobarcodes was o30 nm, which is far below the detection limit of optical microscopy. Polystyrene microbeads (5.5 mm diameter) were thus used to amplify the fluorescence signals for imaging and molecular detection. The microbead-based amplification strategy and detection format are shown in Figure 2a . In this arrangement, two sets of single-stranded (ss)DNA probes were used. The first set (capture probes) was biotin labeled and immobilized onto avidin-functionalized microbeads. Note that each batch of microbeads was attached with only one type of capture probe, which was complementary to a part of a particular target DNA (that is, sample DNA to be detected). Multiple types of microbeads were then pooled together to form a library of microbeads. The second set of ssDNA probes (report probes) was coupled to specific nanobarcodes, where each report probe was complementary to another part of the particular target DNA and thus was able to be hybridized onto a specific microbead in the presence of the target DNA via a sandwiched hybridization (Fig. 2a) . Because each microbead could accommodate a large number of sandwiched complexes, fluorescence signals from nanobarcodes were amplified. In the assay, the sample containing multiple types of unknown DNA (that is, target DNA) was mixed with microbeads in suspension, and captured onto the microbeads containing their corresponding capture probe sequences presented on the bead surface through DNA hybridization. A solution containing a nanobarcode library was then added. Since each nanobarcode was connected with a particular report probe, which in turn hybridized to another portion of the target DNA, nanobarcodes were specifically bound to corresponding microbeads. The resultant microbeads were first evaluated individually by fluorescence microscopy, and the overlay color images are shown in Figure 2b , following a similar color-processing approach reported previously 16 . Even with the naked eye, five different nanobarcodes could be distinguished from Figure 2b . The sample mixture, which consisted of DNA from four targets (Bacillus anthracis 17 , Francisella tularensis 18 , Ebola virus 19 and SARS coronavirus 20 ), was analyzed with nanobarcodes, and four different pseudocolors were revealed in the overlay image (Fig. 2c) . Compared to Figure 2b , we found that four different nanobarcodes, 4G1R, 2G1R, 1G1R and 1G4R, were bound to different microbeads as designed. With the preassigned barcode library (see Supplementary Table 5 online), we concluded that the samples contained characteristic DNA from four pathogens: B. anthracis, F. tularensis, Ebola and SARS. The quantitative decoding results at the population level are also shown (see Supplementary  Fig. 3 online) . Taken together, with one nanobarcode (e.g., 1G1R) serving as a reference, other nanobarcodes could be easily decoded.",

Six samples, including the controls of 27-mer ssDNA with irrelevant sequences and a 6.1-kb plasmid DNA, were first blotted onto a membrane; all five types of nanobarcodes (see Supplementary  Table 4 online) were then used to hybridize onto target DNA for detection (Fig. 3a) . Simultaneous detection of four colors on the resultant membrane (Fig. 3b) indicated four DNA targets, which were subsequently identified by referring to a preassigned decoding library. As expected, no fluorescent signals were detected in the two control spots, suggesting nanobarcode-based detection is highly specific. In addition, a barcode was similarly used to successfully detect a pathogen genomic DNA (Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis) extracted from animal feces in the presence of lysates or serum (data not shown). (c) Schematic illustration of barcode decoding. The nanobarcodes 4G1R, 2G1R, 1G1R, 1G2R and 1G4R were decoded based on the ratio of fluorescence intensity. A molecular recognition element, a probe, was also attached to each nanobarcode. The resultant nanobarcodes possess not only coding capability and capacity, but also molecular sensing ability. With a preassigned code library (see Supplementary Table 5 Flow cytometry is a powerful tool for multiplexed molecular detection 21, 22 . The application of nanobarcodes to multiplexed molecular detection was also demonstrated using flow cytometry. The fluorescence intensity ratio is the basis for the decoding of any nanobarcodes aGbR (see Supplementary Note 1 online for the mathematical processing of flow data). To simultaneously detect DNA from multiple pathogens, we made a solution containing mixtures of DNA from three pathogens with one irrelevant DNA sample as a negative control. This solution was treated as a sample with unknown pathogen DNA. Samples were allowed to bind to the microbeads without saturation. All five types of nanobarcodes (see Supplementary Table 4 online) were then added into a bead suspension. After the hybridization was complete, the fluorescence intensity ratio was measured for each microbead by flow cytometry (Fig. 4b) .",

            "text": "From the intercepts on the flow plots, the K values (the total fluorescence intensity ratio between red and green fluorophores, see Supplementary Note 1 online) of each line (top to bottom) were determined to be 11, 44 and 180, and their code numbers were thus calculated to be around 4.0, 1.0 and 0.25, respectively. Therefore, the detected nanobarcodes were 4G1R, 1G1R and 1G4R. The same detection experiments were repeated four times and the statistical data showed that the coding nanobarcodes were indeed 4G1R, 1G1R and 1G4R (see Supplementary Fig. 4 online) . After referring to the preassigned barcode library (see Supplementary Table 5 online), we concluded that the unknown samples contained DNA from three pathogenic species: B. anthracis, Ebola and SARS. The detection limit was 6.2 \u00c2 10 \u00c016 mole or 620 attomole. The final detection step was completed within 30 s. The success of simultaneously identifying multiple pathogen DNA with attomole sensitivity within a very short period of time (o1 min) demonstrated the potential of nanobarcodes for multiplexed molecular detection. Theoretical and practical coding capacity is discussed in Supplementary Note 2 online. (a) Schematic drawing of a sandwiched DNA nanobarcode whose signal is amplified from polystyrene microbeads. Briefly, biotin-labeled capture probes were attached to avidin-functionalized polystyrene microbeads. Each batch of microbeads had only one type of capture probe before all batches were pooled together. DNA targets (that is, control or unknown samples) were then captured by specific microbeads first. Each report probe, which was linked to a particular nanobarcode, was designed to be complementary to another part of a specific target DNA and thus was able to be hybridized onto a specific microbead. Since each microbead bound a large amount of sandwiched complexes (that is, capture probes/target DNA/report probes/nanobarcodes), fluorescence signals were amplified. (b) Merged fluorescent colors (pseudocolors) of nanobarcodes from individual microbeads. (c) Multiple target detection (a total of four targets) was achieved via a two-colored fluorescence microscope using DNA nanobarcodes and microbeads. All scale bars, 5 mm. Target DNA molecules were manually blotted onto a nylon-membrane. After prehybridization and blocking, a library of nanobarcode mixture was loaded onto the membrane. Through specific hybridizations with report probes that were functionalized with nanobarcodes, target DNA molecules were detected using a fluorescence reader, scanner or microscope. (b) DNA from multiple pathogens (four in total) were detected simultaneously using nanobarcodes. Control 1 was a 27-mer ssDNA with unrelated sequences and control 2 was a plasmid DNA, pVAX1/lacZ. Scale bar, 1 mm. chemical cross-linked dendritic DNA [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] or backbone-branched oligonucleotides 28, 29 ) , to our knowledge no one else has demonstrated successful multiplexed detection using DNA nanobarcodes, whose fluorescence intensity ratios were precisely controlled at an individual molecular level; at present such tight control of color-conjugations can be achieved only with anisotropic, multivalent carriers, such as DL-DNA. In addition, the DNA scaffold makes our nanobarcodes biocompatible and thus has the potential to be applied in vivo after solving degradation problems. Another advantage of using DL-DNA as a scaffolding material lies in the existence of DNA modifying enzymes. Functional elements can be easily introduced either before (e.g., the molecular recognition elements can be linked to the oligonucleotide components) or after nanobarcode synthesis. Moreover, the nano-scale size of our nanobarcodes ensures easier target access in vivo or in situ when compared to current microsized codes 4, [9] [10] [11] [12] . Note that the in situ possibility can be realized only when a spatial resolution can be achieved to distinguish individual barcodes (for example, by DL-DNA that is larger than 150 nm).",
