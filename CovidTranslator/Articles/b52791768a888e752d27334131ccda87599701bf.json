The IC 50 value of cimiside E on gastric cancer cells for 24 h was 14.58 \u00b5M. The mechanism of apoptosis was further elucidated through western blot, RT-PCR, morphology, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle arrest was induced by cimiside E in S phase at a lower concentration (30 \u00b5M) and G2/M phase at higher concentrations (60 and 90 \u00b5M). Cimiside E mediated apoptosis through the induction of the caspase cascade for both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. These findings suggest that cimiside E may be an effective chemopreventive agent against cancer.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is known to participate in various biological processes and is the basis for the meticulous elimination of potentially harmful cells, such as autoreactive immune cells that attack the body's own cells, or neurons that have failed to properly connect (Jacks and Weinberg, 2002) . Apoptosis also defends against infection and virus-infected cells. In contrast to necrosis, apoptosis is a programmed cell death. The apoptotic program can be triggered by ionizing radiation , chemotherapeutic anticancer drugs (Engels et al., 2000) and by natural product-derived supplements (Wieder et al., 2001; Khan et al., 2007) . The morphological characteristics include cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation. Failures in apoptotic pathways can lead to uncontrolled cancerous growth. Thus, the proteins preventing the death of cancer cells are common drug targets. One important pathway in the apoptotic mechanism is the Fas-Fas ligand-mediated pathway. The Fas ligand is a cellsurface protein expressed by activated natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes; it acts through Fas, which is an important cell-surface death receptor. The Fas ligand has a single transmembrane domain and is activated when ligand binding brings three receptor molecules into close proximity. The trimeric receptor complex attracts a protein called the Fas-associated death domain (FADD), which is an adapter that recruits and activates caspase-8. Cleavage of procaspase-8 induces the cleavage and activation of execution caspase-3, leading to apoptosis of mitochondrial-independent cells (Peter and Krammer, 2003) . Another important pathway is related to receive the death signals including the proapoptotic proteins (Bax and Bid) in the cytoplasm that bind to the outer membrane of the mitochondria to signal the release of cytochrome C with the assistance of Bak. Following its release, cytochrome C forms a complex in the cytoplasm with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and Apaf-1. The complex activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3. The caspase-3 activation leads to apoptosis in a mitochondrial-dependent pathway (Prokop et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Traditional herbal medicines have been used for centuries, some of which have proven to be clinically effective in the treatment of many kinds of cancers. The mechanisms of action of extracts or compounds from herbal medicines have been elucidated in different ways. After many years of research, certain compounds which have anticancer effects have been identified, such as, saponins (Luo et al., 2008) , polysaccharides (Ibrahim et al., 2008) , terpenoids (Jayaprakasha et al., 2008) , alkaloids (Magedov et al., 2008) and flavonoids (Topcu et al., 2008) . These kinds of compounds have cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, inhibit DNA synthesis, arrest cell cycle, modulate apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, or inhibit invasion and metastasis. Recently, black cohosh, the extract of C. racemosa, which is closely related to C. heracleifolia, has become increasingly popular as a dietary supplement in the United States for the alleviation of symptoms related to menopause (Radowicki et al., 2006) . The extract of C. heracleifolia has many uses, such as in apoptosis (Tian et al., 2007) , as an anticancer agent (Tian et al., 2006) or an anti-coronavirus (Kim et al., 2008) . It also has anti-allergic and estrogen-like activities (Kim et al., 2004) . Ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, both from C. heracleifolia, were reported as having an anti-inflammatory effect (Sakai et al., 1997; Hirabayashi et al., 1995) . To determine which component is responsible for the anti-cancer effect, several compounds isolated from C. heracleifolia were studied. Of these compounds, cimiside E showed a highly potential effect on apoptosis in AGS cells. In this study we focused on the apoptotic mechanism of cimiside E in AGS gastric cancer cells through cell cycle arrest.",

The dried roots of Cimicifuga Rhizome (10.35 kg) were percolated with methanol (MeOH) three times and concentrated in vacuo. The residue (1.43 kg) was suspended in H 2 O and partitioned successively with hexane, CH 2 Cl 2 , ethylacetate (EtOAc), and butanol (BuOH), yielding hexane (101.09 g), CH 2 Cl 2 (232.07 g), EtOAc, (115.93 g) and BuOH (112.24 g) soluble fractions, respectively. A portion of the EtOAc fraction (100 g) was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography eluted with a stepwise gra-dient of CH 2 Cl 2 : MeOH to yield ten fractions (E1~E10) ordered by their polarities. Fraction E7 was chromatographed again on a silica gel column and eluted with gradient mixtures of CH 2 Cl 2 and MeOH to give three subfractions (E7.1~E7.3). Then, E7.3 was chromatographed again on an RP-18 column eluted with a gradient mixture of MeOH and H 2 O to give two subfractions (E7.3.1~E7.3.2). E.7.3.2 was recrystallized with MeOH, resulting in pure cimiside E. The structure of cimiside E was verified by the comparison of NMR data with those in the literature ( Fig. 1) (Li et al., 1994) . The purity of the compound was assessed 98% based on the HPLC analysis. The HPLC analysis of cimiside E was accomplished on a Waters 2695 instrument (Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a refractive index detector (Waters 2414). An Alltech-Grom C 18 column (150 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size, Rottenburg-Hailfingen, Germany) was used at 30 o C. Isocratic elution was carried out using acetonitrile : water (80:20) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.",

From the western blot analysis, the expression of mutant type p53 significantly decreased from 12 h at 30 \u00b5M, which can slow down the proliferation of AGS cells (Duan et al., 2008) . In addition, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 increased significantly at 24 h after treatment with 60 Fig. 7 . Effects of cimiside E on Fas and FasL expression in AGS cells. Cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well) were treated with cimiside E (30 and 60 \u00b5M) for 1, 3 and 6 h. The equal loading was confirmed by stripping the immunoblots and reprobing them for \u03b2-actin. Fig. 8 . Effects of cimiside E on mt p53, procaspase 3, Bax and Bcl-2 protein expression in AGS cells. Cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well) were treated with cimiside E (30, 60 and 90 \u00b5M) for 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. The equal loading was confirmed by stripping the immunoblots and reprobing them for \u03b2-actin. and 90 \u00b5M cimiside E. Therefore, cimiside E has an apoptotic effect on AGS cancer cells through mitochondrial-dependent and mitochondrial-independent pathways of cell cycle arrest. We propose the mechanism in which cimiside E inhibits AGS proliferation by cell cycle arrest in S phase and induces apoptosis through activation of the caspase cascade in both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, including upregulation of Fas and FasL expression and increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in AGS cells. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest could be attributed to its anti-proliferative effects. These results suggest that cimicide E might be a promising anti-cancer agent.",

To extract DNA, AGS cells were lysed with Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Then total DNA was loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. After electrophoresis, the gel was visualized under a ultraviolet transilluminator.",

B: Treatment of cells with cimiside E (30 \u00b5M) for 3, 6 and 24 h. Then cells were collected and resuspended in 50 \u00b5L cold PBS, and 1 mL of D-PBS was added at room temperature. The full volume of resuspended cells was transferred to 4 mL of absolute ethanol at -20 o C by pipetting the cell suspension slowly into the ethanol while vortexing at top speed. After the cells were restored in ethanol at -20 o C overnight, they were collected by centrifugation. The pellet was washed with cold D-PBS, suspended in 500 \u00b5L PBS and incubated with 5 \u00b5L RNAase (20 \u00b5g/mL) at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were stained with PI (50 \u00b5g/mL) for 15 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry.",
