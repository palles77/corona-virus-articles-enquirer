A product of an unremarkable gestation and vaginal delivery at 39 weeks, she began to have symptoms of an upper respiratory infection at the age of 15 days. The illness abruptly worsened 3 days later with cough, cyanosis, periods of apnea, and progressive respiratory failure precipitating her admission. The mother, who had received DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus) vaccination as a child, reported a mild cough beginning in the 2 weeks prior to delivery. Upon arrival, the infant was having apneic episodes with cyanosis and her O 2 saturation dropped to 36% during a coughing spasm. An initial white blood cell count was 27,200/\u00b5L with 60% lymphocytes and a chest X-ray did not reveal any infiltrates.",

The infant's serum antibody against pertussis toxin was undetectable. The infant slowly improved with fewer bouts of paroxysmal coughing and she was discharged on hospital day 10.

In 2012, almost 50,000 cases were reported, the highest number of cases since 1955 with many infected infants requiring hospitalization, including at least 18 deaths. Outbreaks were also occurring in Europe, Australia, and Japan. It is this dramatic increase, which appears to be tied to the introduction of the safer vaccine (the pertussis paradox 3 ), that has made this infection an emerging (actually reemerging) disease, which has its highest risk of significant morbidity and mortality in infants.",

Among the group, B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. bronchiseptica are the most studied. B. bronchiseptica causes kennel cough in dogs and asymptomatic carriage can occur in many animals, but is not a usual human pathogen. The organism appears to be the evolutionary ancestor of both B. pertussis and B. parapertussis. The organisms are highly trophic for the cilia of the mucosa of the respiratory system and from this location a significant number of toxins are produced, which participate in the disease pathogenesis. B. pertussis is a small, strictly aerobic, Gram-negative coccobacillus that is quite fastidious, requiring specific media for its isolation. The morphology of the organism is not distinguishable from other Bordetellae or from Haemophilus species. B. pertussis is non-motile, oxidase positive, catalase positive, and is relatively inert biochemically. The organism is only isolated from humans.",

Pertussis immunization as part of the DPT vaccine was introduced in the United States in the late 1940s and, as can be seen in Figure 27 .1, the number of reported cases dropped slowly over the decades of the 1950s and 1960s (with periodic bumps characteristic of the infection) to a nadir of 1010 cases in 1976. That number is .99% lower than the number of cases in 1947. The numbers of reported cases remained low but in the 2000\u00c04500 range through the mid-1990s. Because of issues of reactogenicity with DPT related to the whole cell pertussis component, which became a political issue as the vaccine was inaccurately blamed for permanent brain damage among other things, the pertussis pediatric immunization schedule was gradually changed to an acellular one. This vaccine utilizes acellular pertussis toxoids, which were much better tolerated and seemed to produce a similar immune response as compared to DPT. Unlike DPT, the vaccine with a smaller amount of pertussis toxoids (Tdap) could be tolerated in adults.",

The nurse had made multiple healthcare visits but the disease was detected only after a 2-month-old premature infant developed pertussis and four other nurses were subsequently diagnosed with pertussis, probably transmitted by the nurse prior to diagnosis. Azithromycin prophylaxis was recommended to all infants in the unit during the time of the illness of the index nurse. Seventy-two infants received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as well as 72 healthcare workers (HCW). No other infant cases occurred but a resident physician who cared for the ill infant and declined prophylaxis did develop pertussis. A more recent outbreak among oncology nurses also showed transmission among HCW and none from the HCW to patients. 11 With the availability of acellular pertussis vaccine boosters, HCW, especially those with exposure to infants, should be vaccinated.",

The catarrhal phase is characterized by insidious onset of mild upper respiratory symptoms similar to rhinovirus infections including low-grade fever, coryza, sneezing, and a mild, occasional cough. During the 1\u00c02 weeks of this stage, the cough gradually becomes more severe. 2. The paroxysmal phase manifests as spasmodic coughing episodes, or paroxysms of as many as 10 or more coughs without an inspiration. These spasms sometimes are followed by a long inspiratory whooping sound and/or by posttussive vomiting. Paroxysmal attacks occur more frequently at night and may be precipitated by eating. Cyanosis can occur during paroxysms and the spasmodic cough may have many complications including cerebral hypoxia, subcutaneous emphysema, subconjunctival hemorrhage, umbilical or inguinal hernia, rib fracture, severe alkalosis, and seizures. Young children and infants may appear quite distressed and exhausted following an episode. Remarkably, the child can appear well between attacks. This stage usually lasts 2\u00c06 weeks, but may persist for up to 10 weeks. Neither fever nor pharyngitis is common in pertussis unless secondary bacterial superinfections intervene. 3. In the third or convalescent phase, recovery is gradual with paroxysms subsiding initially in frequency and then in severity and the cough may disappear in 2\u00c03 weeks. Paroxysmal episodes may return with other respiratory infections. 17 It is important to be aware that mild or even asymptomatic infection can occur especially in previously immunized children, adolescents, and adults, but even in unimmunized children, as many of 5% of apparently healthy infants had polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evidence of pertussis. 18 The milder illness in older children, adolescents, and adults is manifest by chronic cough lasting 3\u00c04 weeks or longer. In a report of a group of college students who were not clinically diagnosed with pertussis but found to have laboratory evidence of the illness, 19 the mean length of cough was 3 weeks. The only two features differentiating pertussis from non-pertussis in the study were non-productive cough and less likely previous use of antimicrobials. Classical pertussis can occur in adults and it has been observed that adults immunologically primed from previous infection were more likely to have typical pertussis than those primed by immunization. 17 Clearly, much of the severe morbidity and almost all of the mortality from B. pertussis infection occur in those younger than 6 months. As many as 63% of infants younger than 6 months of age with pertussis require hospitalization. 20 In this CDC report from infants with pertussis in 1997\u00c02000, there were 11.8% with pneumonia, 1.4% seizures, 0.2% encephalopathy, and 0.8% died. This compares with parallel numbers of 28, 8.6, 0.7, 0.1, and ,0.1% in infants 6\u00c011 months of age.",

Specific tests for these agents along with pertussis can help but it needs to be remembered that pertussis can co-infect with a respiratory virus and diagnosing a respiratory virus does not exclude the possibility of pertussis. 24 Especially in populations currently immunized with the acellular vaccine, mild pertussis can be difficult to differentiate from B. parapertussis and other viral or bacterial respiratory infections. 25 Infection with B. parapertussis can cause a disease similar to pertussis but parapertussis tends to be milder and of shorter duration than pertussis. It appears that in some areas such as Scandinavia, the two infections can be of equal frequency but generally diagnosed less often and the ratio of subclinical to clinical illness is much higher in parapertussis. 26 In culture, B. parapertussis is less fastidious, is oxidase negative, urea positive, and produces a brown pigment on heart infusion agar. 23 Using different primers for PCR, pertussis (with IS481) and parapertussis (IS1001) can be differentiated, although IS1001 is present in B. bronchiseptica. 23 Serologically, parapertussis does not express Ptx so that Ptx antibodies can distinguish the illnesses of pertussis and parapertussis but the antibody responses to FHA and prn are of similar magnitude. 27 B. holmesii, a more recently described organism, had been initially described as a cause of bacteremia but can cause a symptom complex similar to B. pertussis and, like B. parapertussis, can co-circulate in a population. B. holmesii contains IS481 as B. pertussis but does not produce an anti-PT response. 28 It appears that current vaccination of adolescents and adults does not affect the incidence of B. parapertussis or B. holmesii as much as B. pertussis. 25,28",

Whether measuring specific antibodies to proteins in the vaccine during the primary sequence 34 or assessing pertussis incidence after the sequence ends at age 5, 35 immunity to pertussis promptly waned. Indeed, pertussis incidence and risk ratios rose in the three study states 35 to as high as 8.8 times and 3.9 times in Minnesota between year 1 and year 6 after completion of the sequence. Currently, three-antigen and five-antigen component acellular pertussis vaccines are available in the USA. The five component vaccine had greater efficacy in a head-to-head comparison. 36 Interestingly, the relative risk of pertussis was 8.57 times higher in those with a five-dose aP schedule as compared to those who had received at least one dose of whole cell vaccine, 37 while those with six doses of aP had a relative risk of 3.55 as compared to the one or more whole cell group. Whether changing the balance of antigens in the vaccine or adding different antigens is unclear. In a response to the waning immunity observed following the primary immunization sequence of the acellular pertussis vaccine, further immunizations were recommended first for adolescents, then for adults 19\u00c064 years old, and then for adults 65 years and older. Finally, in order to best \"cocoon\" the as yet unborn baby, recommendations now exist for aP vaccination of the pregnant woman in the 2nd or 3rd trimester. 38 Evolutional changes have been observed in B. pertussis that may have had a role in the organism's ability to persist in a highly immunized population. Despite the genetically monomorphic nature of the pathogen without horizontal acquisition of new genes, Mooi and colleagues have observed strains carrying a mutation in the gene for the Ptx gene promoter, which mediates increased production that was associated with pertussis resurgence 39 and other genetic differences between surface proteins including Ptx, prn, and fimbriae. 40 Additionally, Lan's Australian group 41, 42 have divided B. pertussis isolates into six clusters based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The reemergence of pertussis seemed to coincide with the emergence of SNP cluster 1 of strains carrying prn and Ptx genes (prn2 and ptxP3) able to evade acellular pertussis vaccine-induced selective pressure.",
