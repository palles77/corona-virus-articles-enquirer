Although there have been reports studying the overall immunogenicity of S SL , knowledge on the precise location of immunodominant determinants for S SL is still lacking. In this study, using a series of truncated expressed S SL fragments and S SL specific mouse sera, we identified two immunogenic determinants for S SL . Importantly, one of the two regions seems to be located in a region not shared by known immunogenic determinants of the S SARS . This finding will be of potential use in future monitoring of SL-CoV infection in bats and spillover animals and in development of more effective vaccine to cover broad protection against this new group of coronaviruses.",

Based on the significant sequence difference between the SL-CoV spike protein (S SL ) and S SARS , it is no surprising to find that sera from SL-CoV positive failed to neutralize SARS-CoV . In our previous study, we found that SL-CoV infected bat sera could recognize a HIV-pseudovirus carrying the S SL protein, but not a similar pseudovirus carrying a mutant S SL protein with its receptor binding region replaced by that from the S SARS protein (Zhou P, et al., 2009) .

SL-CoV, which was first identified in 2005 (Lau S K, et al., 2005; Li W, et al., 2005) , may have the potential to spillover to humans through a minimal change in its spike protein (Lau S K, et al., 2010) . This prediction was confirmed in a recent study where a recombinant SL-CoV containing a very small fragment of the SARS-CoV S gene was able to infect and cause disease in mice, further highlighting its potential for pathogenicity in humans (Becker A B Fig. 3 .

From a series of recombinant truncated S SL expressed in this study, we were able to show, by both ELISA and Western blot, that S 280-455 and S 561-666 represent two immunogenic determinants in mice. The region covering aa 280-455 was the more immunogenic of the two since it was recognized not only by the polyclonal mouse sera, but also by all four monoclonal antibodies. It is worth to mention that the S1-81 and S82-280 may also contain conformational immunogenic determinants yet not be identified by the bacteria proteins in this study. It is possible that the use of recombinant full-length S1 protein as selection antigen will result into the loss of valuable monoclonals. Further screening of more immunogenic determinants needs to be performed with protein expressed in eukaryotic cells.",

In view of this, it is not surprising that S 561-666 of S SL also demonstrated the immunogenic in mouse. However, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S SL has low sequence identity to that of S SARS , especially in the critical receptor binding motif (RBM) region (Fig. 3A) . The RBD region of S SARS was known to be a major target of neutralizing antibodies (He Y, 2006; . The corresponding region of S SL also showed high level of immunogenicity, as reported previously (Zhou P, et al., 2009 ). However, a subtle difference was observed from this study. Although residues in the RBM region were reported to be a hotspot for neutralizing antibody production in S SARS (Zhu Z, et al., 2007) , the corresponding region (underlined in Fig.  3A ) in S SL failed to react with any of the four monoclonal antibodies and only reacted with one of the four mouse sera. From a 3D modeling of the RBM region (Fig. 3B ) for the two S proteins, it is evident that the two structures are almost identical except for a few very minor differences. Interestingly, several predicted hotspots for antibody targeting in different SARS-CoV strains, especially those covering the residues 489 and 491 (Zhu Z, et al., 2007) , are highly conserved in S SL both in sequence and predicted structure. But these regions seemed to be non-immunogenic in mice from this study. This could imply a subtle, but important difference in the location of immunodominant determinants between the two S proteins. However, it has to be said that the current study 96 was based on an immunization study in mice, rather than an infection study. Further investigation is required before we can fully assess the potential immunogenicity differences of the different bat SL-CoV S proteins.",
