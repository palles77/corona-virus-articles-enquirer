These formularies recommend sampling of the respiratory tract, bacterial isolation, and susceptibility testing before certain antimicrobial classes, critical for human medicine, can be used. 3 Recently, a change in Belgian law has been made, requiring an antibiogram before fluoroquinolones or cephalosporins can be used. 4 However, to date, there is no consensus on how the respiratory tract should be sampled to isolate causative pathogens.",

Deep nasopharyngeal swab is the easiest, fastest, and cheapest technique and therefore most suitable for sampling large numbers of animals. 6 One major disadvantage is that DNS does not sample the site of interest (pneumonic lung). Previous work in a single feedlot showed moderate agreement between DNS and BAL culture results in calves for Pasteurellaceae (Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica sensu lato, and Histophilus somni) and mycoplasmata. 11 Transtracheal aspiration samples the bronchial bifurcation, but has the disadvantage of being more time-consuming, expensive, and invasive, while at the same time holding a certain risk (e.g., hemorrhage, emphysema, infection) for the animal. 12 Agreement between DNS and TTA culture results was reported in fattening bulls to be moderate for M. haemolytica s.l. 8 A BAL often is performed with an endoscope, which requires costly equipment and carries high risk of contamination when sampling multiple animals successively. 11 Alternatively, BAL can be performed with a reusable sterilized BAL catheter without endoscopic guidance. 13 This makes it easier for large numbers of animals to be sampled at the lung level in a short time frame and with a low cost per calf. However, an important point of criticism is the nasal passage of the BAL catheter, which may inoculate the BAL sample with either respiratory pathogens of the nasal cavity or commensal microflora. 12 Despite the high prevalence of BRD in preweaned calves, 7,14 information on the performance of nonendoscopic BAL and the agreement of DNS and BAL culture results in preweaned calves currently is not available. Results in preweaned calves might substantially differ from those in feedlot cattle, because preweaned calves are more likely to suffer from their first BRD episode, whereas the older feedlot cattle might relapse, and residual pathogenic flora in the lung might differ from the dominant nasopharyngeal flora.",

The herds with clinical BRD were reported by local veterinarians and subsequently visited by the research staff. Calves to be sampled (cases) were selected based on previously described inclusion criteria. 15 Briefly, the following clinical signs were scored on a 4-point scale (score 0-3): lethargy (from standing to recumbency and position of the ears), cough (from absent to spontaneous), rectal temperature (from <39\u00b0C to >39.5\u00b0C), and nasal discharge (from absent to bilateral purulent). An animal with a score \u22655 was considered a case, independent on how many clinical signs were abnormal. Additionally, thoracic ultrasound examination was performed with a 7.5-MHz linear probe b as previously described. 16 The definition for a case was the presence of a consolidated zone in the lung of \u22651 cm 3 . In the affected herds, all animals that met the inclusion criterion were sampled. To avoid subclinical infection or inflammation (bronchitis-pneumonia) because of exposure to BRD risk factors, controls were selected from herds that had not experienced a BRD outbreak in the last month. Controls had to have a normal clinical investigation (0 on the 4-point scale) and absence of any ultrasonographic abnormalities.

Mycoplasma bovis was only found in both veal farms with BRD outbreaks (18.2%; 2 of 11). Very few targeted respiratory pathogens (n = 7) could be retrieved from the 3 control herds. In 2 herds (herds 13 and 14), 2 P. multocida isolates were retrieved, whereas in herd 14, 2 H. somni isolates also were retrieved. In herd 13, M. bovis was isolated from a single calf. In herd 12, no respiratory pathogens could be isolated ( Table 2 ). With DNS and BAL, both in cases as controls, P. multocida (n = 67) was isolated most frequently, followed by M. bovis (n = 39), M. haemolytica s.l. (n = 30), and H. somni (n = 13). In case calves, the isolation rates were not significantly different between DNS and BAL for all studied bacteria, except for H. somni which was less frequently isolated from DNS (P < .01; Table 2 ). Mixed infections (i.e., isolation of \u2265 2 respiratory target bacteria from the same DNS or BAL sample) were only seen in cases from the veal farms (Table 3 ). In cases, agreement between DNS and BAL culture results was moderate for all bacteria (j = 0.41-0.60), with the exception of H. somni, for which it was slight (j = 0.16; Table 4 ). A positive DNS culture result in cases significantly increased the odds of a positive BAL for M. haemolytica s.l., P. multocida, and M. bovis (Table 4 ).

A polymicrobial DNS and BAL culture result in at least 1 animal was present in almost all herds (11 of 14 herds, the other 3 herds had no polymicrobial BAL culture result), but there was very large variation in the percentage of polymicrobial results among the herds sampled (Table 1 ). In the cases, a polymicrobial DNS culture result did not increase the probability of a polymicrobial BAL result by \u226530% (P = .09), nor did it influence the probability of a negative culture (P = .52). However, the probability of retrieving M. haemolytica s.l. and P. multocida from the BAL sample still decreased when the DNS was polymicrobial.

Agreement between DNS and BAL samples was moderate for M. haemolytica s.l., P. multocida, and M. bovis, similar to what was observed for M. haemolytica s.l. in fattening bulls. 11 Agreement was much lower for H. somni, which can be explained by the fact that H. somni is easily overgrown by other bacteria. 20 Given their polymicrobial nature, DNS samples are likely to be falsely negative for H. somni, when no selective media are used. Current understanding of the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia in calves suggests overgrowth of Pasteurellaceae in the nasopharynx and tonsils with subsequent colonization of the trachea and lungs. 21 Even when applying a transtracheal sampling procedure, in diseased animals, one is probably as likely to isolate bacteria that have descended from the nasopharynx as those originating from the lung. Possible reasons why DNS and BAL samples do not agree are false-negative results caused by polymicrobial overgrowth (sampling technique or presence of resident flora), sampling of a nonaffected lung lobe with the nonendoscopic BAL technique, or the absence of deep bronchitis or alveolitis in case calves. The latter reason was excluded as much as possible by the use of ultrasound examination in this study. Previous work showed that this nonendoscopic BAL approach samples a random lung lobe in nonsedated animals, and not necessarily the most frequently affected cranial lobes. 13 This might in part explain why some cultures of cases were negative.

Additionally, the polymicrobial nature of the DNS did not affect the presence of a negative or pure culture result in the BAL. Also, H. somni could be isolated in pure culture from the lungs of diseased calves, whereas it was overgrown or absent on the nasopharyngeal culture. These observations strongly suggest that, under the conditions of our study, nasopharyngeal contamination of a BAL sample is less common than previously assumed. To what extent a possible cleansing effect of the DNS contributes to a pure culture result in the BAL is unclear. On the other hand, a DNS polymicrobial result did decrease the probability of isolating M. haemolytica s.l. or P. multocida from the BAL, whereas this effect was not observed for M. bovis for which selective media were used. Again, this observation could be explained by BAL placement in a healthy lung lobe in a case calf or because respiratory bacteria are not necessarily involved in every case. Several viruses (e.g., bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus) are capable of inducing pneumonia and marked disease without bacterial superinfection. Unfortunately, in our study, viral analysis in each case was not possible for financial reasons. However, in our opinion, the polymicrobial nature of DNA and BAL is strongly influenced by the sampling (technique and DNS, deep nasopharyngeal swab; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; ND, no statistical analysis possible, because of a too small number of observations in one of the groups; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.",

To overcome the issue of possible nasopharyngeal overgrowth in DNS and BAL samples due to nasopharyngeal passage, both the use of selective media for isolation of Pasteurellaceae (e.g., addition of bacitracin 5,7 ) and a more quantitative approach to BAL results 22 might be suitable. Our study focused on culture results obtained when applying DNS and BAL as in practice. To definitively determine the extent and diagnostic importance of possible overgrowth as a consequence of nasopharyngeal passage, experimental work with intensive strain typing and necropsy to confirm the infective status of the lung will be needed. As mentioned above, a significant herd effect was noted on many of the outcomes studied. Deep nasopharyngeal swab and BAL were performed only after cleaning the outer nares and without a protective sleeve as used in previous studies. 6, 11 This could have increased the risk of contamination by bacteria residing in the nostril. In Belgium, DNS for practical reasons is routinely performed without a protective sleeve, again increasing external validity in this study. Multiple samplers participated in the study, and although all of them received at least 1 training session from the same trainer before the start of the study, variation in the extent of experience in taking DNS or BAL samples and in the hygienic procedures accompanying these techniques might have influenced the results. Deep nasopharyngeal swab samples might be polymicrobial due to the presence of a highly variable nasopharyngeal microflora 23 or due to environmental contamination (e.g., touching the muzzle or other objects during sampling). Other reasons might be environmental or aerosolized dust, endotoxin, bedding conditions, and issues with stable ventilation. Likely, the risk of catheter contamination increases when repeated attempts to enter the trachea are needed or when the esophagus is accidently entered. Adequate training is likely the only solution, other than considering other procedures such as protective sleeves, agar plugs, or visualization of the larynx through a low-cost laryngoscope.",

            "text": "In conclusion, a nonendoscopic BAL results in less contaminated (and therefore more easily interpretable samples) compared to DNS under the conditions of this study. It returns an interpretable result in 79.2% of the cases, compared to 31.2% in DNS, and has better isolation rates for H. somni, offering a better return on investment for bacteriological sampling. It can be performed rapidly in a representative number of animals at low cost and likely has less impact on animal welfare then more invasive techniques. ",
