( 1 ) Four different HBoV types have been described thus far, including HBoV type 1 (HBoV1) predominately found in the respiratory tract. ( 1-3 ) HBoV1 is commonly detected in association with other respiratory viruses during respiratory infections. Because of this finding in addition to frequent prolong shedding in asymptomatic children, its pathogenic role has been questioned. ( 4 ) Nonetheless, increasing evidence confirms the association of HBoV1 with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URI and LRI), and acute otitis media (AOM) in young children. ( 2, (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) ) A recent study suggested that acquired immunity could be achieved by age 6, with a median of 2.3 years, ( 5 ) making an acute HBoV1 infection more likely during childhood. Prolonged HBoV1 presence in nasopharyngeal secretions has been described for up to 6 months ( 8, 10 ) and identified in healthy asymptomatic children. ( 2, 4, 5, 11, 12 ) In a previous study, ( 13 ) we detected HBoV DNA in nasopharyngeal secretions of children during acute URI. Herein, we further analyzed HBoV using pyrosequencing, a rapid, simple and cost-effective method targeting specific regions of DNA. The aim was to characterize the nucleic acid sequences detected, to differentiate prolong presence from a newly acquired infection and to compare the latter to AOM development.",

            "text": "Specimens analyzed in this study were archived nasopharyngeal secretions that were HBoV positive (+). The specimens were collected from a prospective, longitudinal study performed between January 2003 and March 2007 at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas, USA. ( 14 ) Healthy children (6 to 36 months of age) with no associated comorbidities were enrolled and followed for one year each for occurrences of viral URI and AOM. The Institutional Review Board approved the study; informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of all the study subjects. Specimens were collected only during URI visits and when AOM were diagnosed; the specimens were tested for respiratory viruses by viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously described. ( 13, 14 ) In the original study ( 14 ) , 988 specimens obtained from 214 children were tested for viruses; 707 archived specimens were available for HBoV-PCR testing. ( 13 ) Archived DNA from HBoV positive specimens were recovered; PCR prior to each pyrosequencing assay was achieved using three different sets of primers designed in order to target 3 different regions of the HBoV genome including NP1, VP1 and VP2. By targeting a highly conserved region within the HBoV genome, the NP1 region, ( 15 ) we differentiated HBoV type 1 from other less common types occasionally identified in the respiratory tract (2, 3, or 4) . Conversely, VP1 and VP2 regions are highly variable regions in the virus and several sequences have been described by different authors, ( 15-17 ) potentially allowing differentiation of more than one HBoV1. By targeting these areas, we were able to identify and subtype various types of HBoV1. Primers used in this study include: NP1 primers: Forward: Biotin-CGCATTGCTAGAGATGGTACTAA and Reverse: ACATTAGCTAAGTGCCTACGGTA, sequencing: ATTACATCTTTCACAATCAG. VP1 primers: Forward: Biotin-CTAAACCAGGAACCTCAAAAATGT and Reverse: TCCTCCTCCAATACTTCCTGTTC, sequencing: TGTTCCTCCCCCTGA. VP2 primers: Forward: Biotin-GTGAATGGRTTAAYAATGAAAGAGC and Reverse: TGCTGTGCTTCCGTTTTGTC, sequencing: CTTATGTACTGAACTCTTCT. A c1000 thermocycler was used to carry out PCR using the following protocol: Master mix per sample composed of 12.5 \u00b5l Bio-Rad Supermix, 1.0 \u00b5l forward primer (5 \u00b5M), 1.0 \u00b5l reverse primer (5 \u00b5M), 6.5 \u00b5l of TOC water and 3 \u00b5l of the DNA template. The reactions were carried out as follows: cycle 1: 95\u00b0C (1 minute and 30 seconds); cycle 2: 95\u00b0C (30 seconds), 58\u00b0C (30 seconds), 72\u00b0C (30 seconds) and repeated 49 times. These were followed by 5 minutes at 72\u00b0C and a hold step at 4\u00b0C. The resulting biotinylated PCR products were pyrosequenced using a Pyromark ID 96 instrument with PyroMark Gold reagents following the manufacture's instructions. For each assay the final sequencing primer concentration was 0.3 \u00b5M with a cyclic dispensation: 12 (GTAC). Resulting sequences were compared using a HBoV1 library built from GenBank/BLAST and Clustal Omega alignment functions, based on the most variable regions targeted (VP1 and VP2), subtypes within HBoV type 1 were described based on existing worldwide sequences: hBoV1_Irish, KU3, BJ3722, Bonn-1, LWK, TW674, st1. ( 1, 16-21 ) We assigned a unique identifier for each strain based on the sequence (both VP1 and VP2) that showed the greatest homology to the sample: KU3, BJ, Bonn, LWK, TW.",

Three children had only one negative follow-up sample each 14-19 days later. Similarly, a pattern of no recurrence after positive episode (Pattern 2) was identified in 10 children; all with viral clearance after 30 days and at least two (2 -6) negative follow-up samples after 32 to 267 days. Prolonged presence (Pattern 3) was defined as repeated presence of the same HBoV1 strain for more than 30 days. Of these, 5 children had 1 or more negative episodes suggesting the presence of virus <60 days; the remaining had persistent infection over 60 days. Intermittent detection (Pattern 4) was defined as the presence of a specific HBoV1 subtype in subsequent URI episodes with at least one negative HBoV1 (+)-URI in between. A recurrent HBoV1 infection (Pattern 5) was identified when a specific subtype was present during an URI episode then reappeared after several (4-5) HBoV-negative URI episodes. Finally, 2 subjects (4%) were infected with two different HBoV1 subtypes (Bonn/BJ and LWK/BJ in one subject and Bonn/BJ and LWK/TW in the other) within 1-year-period (Pattern 6). Figure 2 illustrates different patterns of HBoV1 shedding. Subject 1 (28-month old), with 7 symptomatic URI episodes had HBoV1-LWK/TW subtype identified in two episodes and corresponding to newly acquired infection with clearance in less than 30 days. HBoV1 coinfected with rhinovirus and adenovirus/rhinovirus in this case. Subject 2 (6-month old) had 7 URI episodes with only the initial being HBoV1-Bonn/BJ (+), co-infecting with enterovirus. This was followed by several negative samples for a total of 260 days. Subject 3 (14-month old) had 5 URI episodes, with 2 being HBoV1-LMK/BJ consecutively for 53 days (pattern of prolonged presence); HBoV1 co-infected with enterovirus and parainfluenza. Subject 4 had 7 URI episodes from HBoV1-LWK/BJ (+) and exhibited a pattern of prolonged presence for 99 days; HBoV1 co-infected with influenza and adenovirus/rhinovirus. Subject 5 (30-month old) had 6 URI episodes with two HBoV1-LWK/TW (+) intermittently detected with 2 negative samples in between; HBoV1 coinfected with adenovirus and enterovirus. Subject 6 (11-month old) had 7 URI episodes with 3 being HBoV1-LWK/TW (+), with the last episode occurring after an interval of 323 days from the previous HBoV1-URI episode, representing recurrence or virus reactivation; HBoV1 co-infected with enterovirus and influenza. Lastly, subject 7 (8-month old) had 10 URI episodes with 3 HBoV1 (+) of two different subtypes: one HBoV1-Bonn/BJ (+) and two HBoV1-LWK/BJ (+); HBoV1 co-infected with cytomegalovirus and RSV in this case.",

( 4-6, 9, 22, 23, 27, 29 ) In this study, even with lack of serology to confirm acute infection, the absence of other co-infecting respiratory viruses during URI and previously HBoV1-negative samples suggest that new HBoV1 infection is highly associated with AOM following URI (8 out of 15 episodes).
