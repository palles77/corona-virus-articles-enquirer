Interestingly, while viral genomic RNAs persisted in infected cells over 14 subsequent passages with concomitant synthesis of viral subgenomic mRNAs and structural proteins, no infectious virus was isolated beyond passage 2. Further biochemical and electron microscopic analyses revealed that virions, while assembled, contained little spike in the envelope, indicating that lack of infectivity during persistence was likely due to deficiency in spike incorporation. This type of non-lytic, non-productive persistence in oligodendrocytes is unique among animal viruses and resembles MHV persistence previously observed in the mouse central nervous system. Thus, establishment of such a culture system that can recapitulate the in vivo phenomenon will provide a powerful approach for elucidating the mechanisms of coronavirus persistence in glial cells at the cellular and molecular levels.",

            "text": "Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a member of the Coronaviridae. It is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus. The viral envelope contains three or four structural proteins, depending on viral strains (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . The spike (S) protein is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 180 kilo Dalton (kDa). For some MHV strains such as JHM and A59, the S protein can be cleaved by a furin-like proteinase into two subunits: the amino terminal S1 and the carboxyl-terminal S2. The S1 subunit is thought to form the globular head of the spike and is responsible for the initial attachment of the virus to the receptor on cell surface. The S2 subunit, which forms the stalk portion of the spike and which anchors the S protein to the viral envelope, facilitates the fusion between viral envelope and cell membrane and cell-cell fusion (Chambers et al., 1990; de Groot et al., 1987; de Haan et al., 2004; Gallagher et al., 1991; Kubo et al., 1994; Luytjes et al., 1987; Nash and Buchmeier, 1997; Stauber et al., 1993; Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996; Zhu et al., 2009) . It is therefore an important determinant for viral infectivity, pathogenicity and virulence (Boyle et al., 1987; Collins et al., 1982; Phillips et al., 1999) . The small envelope (E) protein and the membrane (M) protein play a key role in virus assembly (Vennema et al., 1996; Yu et al., 1994) . The nucleocapsid (N) protein is a phosphoprotein of approximately 50 kDa and is associated with the RNA genome to form the nucleocapsid inside the envelope (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Stohlman and Lai, 1979) . Upon entry into host cells, the viral genomic RNA serves as an mRNA for translation of the viral polymerase polyprotein from the 5\u2032 most overlapping open reading frames 1a and 1b (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . The polyprotein is then processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp's), which possibly along with host factors form replication and transcription complexes that generate a nested-set of subgenomic mRNAs (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder et al., 2003) . Each subgenomic mRNA is translated into a structural or nonstructural protein. The structural proteins are assembled into virions in cytoplasmic vesicles (Vennema et al., 1996) , which are then released (exocytosed) from the infected cell.",

In the CNS, acute encephalitis usually occurs during the first week of infection, and acute demyelination can be detected histologically as early as 6 days post infection (p.i.). By the end of the second week, if the mice survive virus infection, most of the viruses are cleared from the CNS, and demyelination develops. Although infectious virus can no longer be isolated from the CNS during the chronic phase (\u22483 weeks p.i.), viral RNAs are continuously detectable by Northern blot or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Demyelination continues to peak at around 30 days p.i., and then slowly decreases until over a year p.i.,",

While these studies have led to the establishment of MHV persistence in fibroblast 17Cl-1 cells, astrocytoma DBT cells and primary oligodendrocytes, infectious viruses continued to be produced, albeit at an extremely low level (Chen and Baric, 1996; Lavi et al., 1987; Sawicki et al., 1995; Schickli et al., 1997) . Thus, such persistence does not resemble the phenomenon observed in mouse CNS. Although we have previously reported the establishment of a persistent, non-productive infection in a rat progenitor oligodendrocyte cell line (Liu et al., 2003; Liu and Zhang, 2005) , the cells that harbor persistent viruses have not been confirmed, largely due to difficulty in separating infected cells from uninfected cells in a mixed culture. In an effort to establish a robust in vitro system that can faithfully recapitulate the in vivo phenomenon, in the current study we made several modifications in our experimental approach. We used a recombinant MHV that expresses a green fluorescence protein (GFP) such that infected cells can be easily identified and separated from noninfected cells. Using this approach, we were able to identify a new type of mouse oligodendroglial cell line (N20.1) that was persistently infected with MHV. Consistent with the results in rat progenitor oligodendrocytes (Liu and Zhang, 2005) , viral RNA persisted for over 14 passages without the production of infectious virus. Significantly and unexpectedly, we discovered that persistently infected oligodendrocytes continued to produce viral particles but that these particles were deficient in incorporation of spike proteins on the virion surface, thus providing a mechanism for the lack of viral infectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first report in virology describing non-productive, persistent infection that continuously produces virus particles without infectivity due to a lack of spike protein incorporation.",

However, it was not clear in that study whether all cells or only a fraction of the cell population were initially infected with MHV. This question is important because the mechanism of persistence could be different under these conditions. To unequivocally address this question and to identify additional cell lines for such studies, we used the recombinant MHV-A59/GFP, which expresses the GFP, and two additional mouse oligodendrocytic cell lines N20.1 (Verity et al., 1993) and Oligo-neu (Jung et al., 1995) . The rationale for using MHV-A59/GFP was to quantitatively assess the susceptibility of the cell population to virus infection and to track the extent of viral persistence following continuous passage of the cells. Thus, CG-4, N20.1 and Oligo-neu cells were infected with MHV-A59/GFP at an m.o.i. of 10, and were observed for GFP expression. We found that less than 0.1% of the CG-4 cells expressed strong GFP at 24 and 48 h p.i. (data not shown) while approximately 25% of N20.1 cells (Fig. 1B, a-b) and b20% of Oligo-neu cells exhibited strong fluorescence for the same time period (data not shown). Because of the highest cell number of GFP expression and relative ease in culture, N20.1 cells were used in all subsequent experiments described in this report.",

Indeed, viral genomic RNAs were detected with all 5 pairs of primers (Fig. 2B) , confirming the presence of the viral genome. We then isolated intracellular RNAs from various passages of the infected cells (VP1 to VP14) and used RNAs from acutely infected (VP0) and mock-infected N20.1 cells as a positive and negative control, respectively, for RT-PCR with the primer pair 5\u2032N and 3\u2032N. Results showed that viral genomic RNAs were present in all passages tested (Fig. 2C ). Thus, real-time qRT-PCR (using primer pair 5\u2032qPCR and 3\u2032qPCR) was used to further quantify the viral genomic RNAs in these passages. It was found that in general the amount of viral genome decreased drastically from VP0 to VP4, but relatively slowly thereafter (Fig. 2D ).

However, the eventual disappearance of GFP-positivity led us to further examine potential defects in viral gene expression in persistently infected N20.1 cells since the GFP ORF is under the control of the consensus intergenic sequence for subgenomic mRNA 4 ( Fig. 3A ) (Das Sarma et al., 2002) . Thus, both the genomic regions encompassing the GFP coding sequence and the subgenomic mRNA4 at VP4 were specifically amplified by RT-PCR using the pair of primers 5\u2032IG4-3\u2032G5a and 5\u2032Leader-3\u2032G5a, respectively, and the PCR products were sequenced directly or following shotgun cloning. Interestingly, we found that the entire GFP ORF was intact within the persistent viral genome (data not shown) but that there were multiple species of subgenomic mRNA4 varying in size (Fig. 3B) . These mRNAs contained a leader RNA fused at multiple sites downstream of the AUG translation initiation codon, thus effectively abolishing the expression of the GFP gene, a phenomenon reminiscent of the aberrant transcription described previously for MHV (Fischer et al., 1997; Zhang and Lai, 1994) .",

As an example shown in Fig. 4 , mRNA7 (for N gene) and mRNA3 (for S gene) were detected in various passages of the persistently infected cells but not in mock-infected cells (Figs. 4B and C) by RT-PCR using a pair of primers (5\u2032Leader-3\u2032S1 and 5\u2032Leader-3\u2032N) that specifically detect the respective mRNA species (Fig. 4A ). Similarly, viral N and S proteins were detected in these persistently infected cells by Western blot analysis and their expression appeared to decline over continuous passages when compared to the \u03b2-actin control (Figs. 4D and E). mRNAs for other structural proteins (M and E) were also detected (data not shown).

To further determine the time point at which infectious virus was no longer recoverable, medium and cell lysate were collected at various days after seeding of the fluorescence-positive cells at VP1.

These results, combined with the data shown in Figs. 1-4, reaffirm that MHV established persistence of viral genome in oligodendrocytes without the production of infectious viruses or with extremely low level of infectious virus (below the detection limit).

Culture medium was collected from persistently infected N20.1 cells between passages 6 and 10. Virions, if any, were concentrated through 30% sucrose cushion and were further purified via 20-70% sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation. The gradient was then fractionated and the buoyant density of each fraction was determined. Presence of viral N protein was determined by Western blot using an N-specific mAb. As shown in Fig. 6A , N protein was detected in the fractions 5 to 10, which correspond to the buoyant density between 1.14 and 1.20 g/ml. The standard buoyant density in sucrose for MHV-A59 is 1.18-1.19 g/ml (Liebermann, 1982) , which corresponds to fraction 8 in Fig. 6A . Since the majority of N protein was present in fractions 5-6, the data indicate that virus particles were likely produced but that they were slightly lighter than the infectious virus, suggesting some kind of defects with the virus particles. One possibility for a lower buoyant density is the lack of viral genomic RNA, i.e. virus-like particles. However, since the N protein is associated with the genome, the detection of N protein in the viral fractions argues against this possibility, although N protein can also interact with M protein during assembly (Narayanan et al., 2000) . Nevertheless, to experimentally demonstrate this possibility, fractions 5 to 10 were combined. RNAs were then extracted for RT-PCR with primers specific to viral genome within the N gene-coding region. Indeed, specific viral genomic RNAs were detected in the purified fractions from persistently infected N20.1 cells (Fig. 6B , lane VP) and in virus samples derived from acutely infected 17Cl-1 cells that served as a positive control (Fig. 6B , lane V). Viral RNAs were not detected in samples derived from mock-infected N20.1 or 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 6B) . These results confirm that viral genomes were present in the fractions that represent viral particles.",

In general, diverse morphology of the virions had been observed in each grid for the same sample (Fig. 7) . The shape and size of the virions isolated from acutely or persistently infected N20.1 cells and from 17Cl-1 cells were indistinguishable. Interestingly, however, little to no spike was found on the virions isolated from persistently infected N20.1 cells (panels a-b). In contrast, virions isolated from acutely infected N20.1 or 17Cl-1 cells exhibited the typical \"crown\" morphology of the coronavirus, i.e. the spike protein protruding from the virion surface to form a ring (panels c-e).

While the E protein is not absolutely required for replication, lack of E drastically reduces viral replication and fitness (Kuo and Masters, 2003) . Thus, to gain an insight into potential defects associated with S protein incorporation, we determined whether any mutations in the carboxyl-terminal domain of S protein or M and E proteins arisen during persistence might contribute to the lack of incorporation. We amplified a sequence at the 3\u2032-end of S gene that encodes the carboxyl-terminal domain of the S protein (including the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail) from various passages of persistently infected N20.1 cells (Figs. 8B and C). We also amplified the entire ORFs of the M and E gene from acutely (VP0) and persistently infected N20.1 cells at passages 10 (VP10) and 16 (VP16) (Figs. 8B and C). Direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products (Fig. 8C ) revealed that there was no single nucleotide mutation at the 3\u2032-end of the S gene and within the ORF for M and E genes (data not shown). These results suggest that deficient incorporation of S protein in the virions during persistence unlikely results from lack of interactions among envelope proteins due to mutations in the interacting domains.",

To recapitulate this in vivo phenomenon it would be highly desirable to have a robust in vitro cell culture system, such that the molecular mechanisms of viral persistence can be carefully examined at the cellular level. In an effort to achieve that objective, over the past decades we and others have searched a large number of susceptible cell lines and primary cell cultures for their potential as hosts for MHV persistence. Although these investigations have established MHV persistence in many types of cells following various manipulations of culture conditions, persistently infected cells continue to produce infectious viruses (Chen and Baric, 1996; Lavi et al., 1987; Sawicki et al., 1995; Schickli et al., 1997) . Only the rat progenitor oligodendrocyte CG-4 cell line has been reported to harbor MHV genomes without producing infectious viruses (Liu and Zhang, 2005). However, in that study it was not clear whether all cells had been infected with MHV (Liu and Zhang, 2005) . It is more likely that only a small population of cells were initially infected with MHV or were permissive for MHV replication, because less than 1% of the infected cells exhibited strong fluorescence when stained with an antibody specific to MHV N protein (Liu et al., 2003) . This suggests that only a tiny fraction of the cells may persistently harbor the virus.",

            "text": "In the present study, we employed a recombinant MHV that expresses GFP. This improvement allows us to screen multiple cell lines for their susceptibility to MHV infection and to identify and isolate infected cells. Indeed, we found that \u224825% of N20.1 cells exhibited strong GFP expression (Fig. 1) . Subsequent FACS sorting and subcultures of the GFP-positive N20.1 cells led to the establishment of persistent infection without production of infectious viruses (Figs. 1-4) , which recapitulates the phenomenon observed in mouse CNS. Thus, establishment of such a faithful system paves the foundation for future mechanistic studies of MHV persistence in CNS cells. Ironically, non-productive persistence is established only in 3 cell lines of oligodendrocytic origin (mouse oligodendrocyte N20.1 and Oligo-neu (this study) and rat progenitor oligodendrocyte CG-4 (Liu and Zhang, 2005) ) in spite of different conditions used for establishing these cell lines. This raises a possibility that this kind of MHV persistence is cell-type specific. CG-4 cell is a permanent, undifferentiated type 2 oligodendrocyte/astrocyte progenitor cell that was originally established during a primary neural cell culture derived from the brain of newborn (1-3 days postnatal) Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Louis et al., 1992) . It is maintained at the progenitor state under complex culture conditions containing various growth factors. It can differentiate into mature oligodendrocyte upon changing culture conditions. N20.1 cell is a cell line clone derived from mouse primary cultures of oligodendrocytes conditionally immortalized by transformation with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the simian virus 40 large-T antigen (Verity et al., 1993) . The Oligo-neu is a murine oligodendroglial precursor cell line established via transformation of a replication-defective retrovirus expressing t-neu oncogene linked to the external region of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (Jung et al., 1995) . Although the 3 cell lines were derived from different animal species and were established by different methods, they appear to retain the susceptibility to nonproductive persistence by MHV. This is in stark contrast to fibroblast (17Cl-1) and astrocytoma (DBT) cell lines (Chen and Baric, 1996; Sawicki et al., 1995) , where infectious virus continues to generate. Another difference between the non-productive persistence in N20.1 cells and the productive persistence in fibroblast and astrocytoma cell lines is that persistence can be established only in mixed (infected and uninfected; susceptible and resistant) cultures of 17Cl-1 and DBT (Chen and Baric, 1996; Sawicki et al., 1995) . In such mixed cultures with low multiplicity of infection, a small number of viruses released from a small fraction of cell populations can infect neighboring uninfected cells and thus the persistence can be maintained in an epigenetic fashion (Sawicki et al., 1995) . The persistence in N20.1 cells was established following selection of infected cells. When GFP-expressing 17Cl-1 or DBT cells were selected by the same FACS sorting following infection with MHV-A59/GFP, continuous passaging of the GFP-expressing 17Cl-1 and DBT cells was not possible, due to extensive cell death for 17Cl-1 as described by Chen and Makino (2002) or extensive cell fusion for DBT cells. However, it has been reported that infectious virus continued to produce in persistently infected primary mouse oligodendrocytes (Lavi et al., 1987) . One possible reason for the observed difference between primary oligodendrocytes and established oligodendroglial cell lines is that primary oligodendrocytes cannot be subcultured for many passages, thus leaving insufficient time for eventual cease of infectious virus production to take place. Another possibility is that culture conditions used for primary cells and cell lines might be different, which can affect cell proliferation and differentiation, which in turn affect virus replication and infectious virus production. A third possibility is that most primary cultures have a certain degree of impurity, i.e., contamination with a small number of astrocytes and microglia that can serve as a reservoir for infectious virus production, albeit at a low level.",

Interestingly, while aberrant transcription of subgenomic mRNA for GFP gene, a phenomenon reminiscent of the aberrant transcription described previously for MHV (Fischer et al., 1997; Zhang and Lai, 1994) , was identified (Fig. 3) , subgenomic mRNAs coding for viral structural proteins such as S, E, M, and N were transcribed with no apparent abnormality; further Western blot analyses confirmed the expression of these viral structural proteins (Figs. 2 and 4 and further data not shown). Thus, it appears that MHV has the ability to selectively inactivate the GFP gene expression through aberrant transcription while keeping viral own genes continuously expressed. Why and how MHV can discriminate self from non-self during gene expression remain an interesting subject for future investigation.",

            "text": "It has been known for decades in the coronavirus research field that MHV can establish persistent infection in the mouse CNS without apparent production of infectious viruses. This kind of so-called nonproductive persistence is unique among animal viruses. The most intriguing question remained to be answered, however, is what the major defects in the virus life cycle are associated with the nonproductive persistence. Despite the enormous technical challenges on studying persistent infection, our comprehensive biophysical, Following purification of the virus preparations, the sucrose gradient was fractionated and the buoyant density (g/ml) for each fraction was determined and plotted (see Materials and methods). The presence of virus in each fraction was further determined by Western blot analysis using a mAb specific to viral N protein. The dashed line indicates the standard buoyant density (1.18-1.19 g/ml) for coronaviruses as a reference. (B) Presence of viral genomic RNA in the purified viral preparations. RNAs were isolated from gradient-purified fractions. RT-PCR was performed to detect viral genomic RNAs (VP). Preparations from mock-infected N20.1 cells or 17Cl-1 cells were used as a negative control while preparation from acutely infected 17Cl-1 cells (V) was used as a positive control. Arrow indicates the unique RT-PCR product representing viral RNA. (C) Presence of viral structural proteins in the gradient-purified virus preparations from persistently infected N20.1 cells was determined by Western blot using antibodies to MHV S, N and E proteins. Virus preparations from acutely infected 17Cl-1 cells were purified in parallel and used as a positive control. biochemical and EM analyses have identified a potentially key defect in the virus life cycle, which may contribute to the lack of viral infectivity. We found that viral genomic RNAs continuously replicate, that subgenomic mRNAs are transcribed, and that viral structural proteins are expressed in persistently infected N20.1 cells. Successful continuation of these processes likely contributes to the maintenance of viral persistence. However, we also found that while viral particles are assembled in the persistently infected cells (Figs. 6 and 7) , these virions are not infectious upon infection of susceptible DBT cells (data not shown), although continuous blind passage of \"infected\" DBT cells has not been carried out. The most likely reason for a lack of infectivity of these virions is deficiency in incorporation of viral spike protein into the viral envelope, since spike protein is the key determinant for coronavirus infectivity. This is evidenced with the EM examination, which shows that virions isolated from persistently infected cells scarcely have spikes protruding from virion surface. Although the spike sometimes can get lost following the purification procedures, the overwhelming presence of spikes in virions isolated from acutely infected N20.1 or 17Cl-1 cells, which have been subjected to the same purification procedures in parallel experiments, suggests that the deficiency in spike incorporation into persistent viral particles is not simply caused by technicality; rather it is more likely due to some kind of defects in virion assembly. However, since virions from acutely infected N20.1 cells are infectious and have abundant spikes (Fig. 7, d-e) , this finding suggests that defective incorporation of spike protein may have occurred following the establishment of persistent infection.",

            "text": "What caused defective incorporation of spike protein? Since there are no apparent mutations in virion envelope proteins (Fig. 8 ) associated with S incorporation (de Haan et al., 1999; de Haan and Rottier, 2007) , we hypothesize that some cellular factors that are triggered by MHV infection and persistence might in turn inhibit spike protein incorporation into virions. It has been reported that treatment of cells with type I interferon (IFN) significantly inhibited the glycosylation of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein, the incorporation of G protein into virions and the virus infectivity (Maheshwari et al., 1980a,b; Jay et al., 1983 ). It has also been shown that inhibition of glycosylation of MHV S protein by the drug tunicamycin led to retention of unglycosylated S protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), prevented S protein from incorporation into virions and resulted in production of spikeless virions and loss of viral infectivity (Holmes et al., 1981; Rottier et al., 1981) . Similarly, infection with two temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV-A59 resulted in lack of the mature Golgi form and oligomerization of S, retention of the S in the ER, and lack of S in purified virions produced at the non-permissive temperature (Luytjes et al., 1997) . A mutant isolated from DBT cells persistently infected with MHV-JHM strain exhibited slightly lower buoyant density and had fewer spikes; although the mutant replicated slower (small plaque mutant), it was nevertheless infectious (Makino et al. 1983) . Interestingly, type I IFN is induced in N20.1 cells by MHV infection and pretreatment of N20.1 cells with IFNs inhibited MHV infectivity (Li et al., 2010) . Coincidently, there is apparent deficiency of a higher molecular weight (possibly glycosylated) S protein from IFN-producing, persistent N20.1 cells as compared to that from IFN-nonproducing 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 6C) . Thus, we speculate that, like VSV G protein, IFNs and possibly other cellular factors that are induced by MHV infection in N20.1 cells subsequently inhibit virus infectivity by blocking the incorporation of S protein into virions during assembly. Such a possibility is currently under intense investigation.",

It was kindly provided by Dr. Anthony Compadre (University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine). The N20.1 cell represents a mature oligodendrocyte because it expresses the myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), but one that is at a very early stage of maturity based on the expression of the MBP and PLP alternatively spliced mRNA population (Verity et al., 1993) . In addition, the N20.1 cell can be recognized by the A2B5 antibody, which recognizes a surface galactolipid expressed by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells; the A007 antibody, which is specific for sulfatide and found on cells committed to the oligodendrocyte lineage as well as mature oligodendrocytes, and the anti-GC antibody, which recognizes the protein expressed specifically by mature oligodendrocytes (Verity et al., 1993) . The N20.1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and G418 (100 \u03bcg/ml) at the permissive temperature of 34\u00b0C.
