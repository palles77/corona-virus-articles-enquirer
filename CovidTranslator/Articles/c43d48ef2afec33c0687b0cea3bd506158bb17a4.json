The Malmquist productivity change index can be used to track the specific position corresponding to each hospital and to examine changes in productivity and quality [17] . F\u00e4re et al. [18] advanced the Malmquist productivity index to measure changes in the following three components of productivity growth: quality change, efficiency change, and technical change.

We attempt to overcome this problem by incorporating the quality indicator in our estimation. Specifically, we examine productivity change and its three components (quality change, relative efficiency change, and technical change) from the pre-TQIP period to the post-TQIP period. Analyzing operations data from 31 TQIP regional hospitals in Taiwan from the pre-TQIP period (1998) to the post-TQIP period  (2002 and 2004) , we find that TQIP hospitals demonstrated significant productivity growth in the post-TQIP period. This growth is attributable to quality change and relative efficiency progress, meeting the TJCHA's expected goal. Our results also indicate that efficiency and quality improve simultaneously after TQIP participation, which coincides with the philosophy of total quality management (TQM) and confirms the efficiency improvement and quality assurance functions of TQIP.",

The Department of Health further established the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation (TJCHA) in 1999. There are four stated missions for the TJCHA, comprising of: (1) assisting and promoting national medical quality policies; (2) determining medical quality certification standards; (3) consulting with healthcare organizations; and (4) promoting the relationship between the hospitals and the patients. The ultimate goal is to integrate and upgrade the overall quality of the healthcare system. There have been several programs implemented by TJCHA, including Hospital accreditation, Healthcare Quality Improvement Circle (HQIC), and Healthcare Quality Learning Organization. Making successful experience and international benchmarking reference to the International Quality Indicator Project (IQIP), TJCHA initiated the Taiwan Quality Indicator Project (TQIP) in 2000 to meet the requirements of its fourfold mission. By 2004, there had been 72 hospitals joined TQIP.",

The motivating factor behind the IQIP is not just the collection of data, but in analyzing the underlying causes that lead to certain outcomes. The aims of the IQIP are to develop educational materials, to conduct user groups and educational sessions in the field, to learn from the efforts of IQIP participants to understand and put their data to work, and to assist in participants' benchmarking and networking activities.",

Due to such changes in organizational adjustment over time, short-term performance impact may differ from longer-term impact. For example, treatment cost may increase initially following quality improvement adoption because of changes in long-standing organizational routines and investment in data systems and other elements of QI infrastructure. However, organizational performance may, over a sufficiently long period of time, result in net savings and improved economic efficiency [24] .",

However, there was only higher bed occupancy in lower quality hospitals. Harkey and Vraciu [30] discussed the relationship between quality and financial performance.

Among the participating hospitals, 63 hospitals collected the acute care indictor data as recommended by TJCHA and the Department of Health of Taiwan. Depending on their primary functions, hospitals in Taiwan are divided into three basic levels: medical centers, regional hospitals, and district hospitals. The reimbursement schedule under the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act, while uniform within a given level of hospitals, varies by the level of hospitals. The type of patients serviced (hospital output) also varies within these different levels of hospitals. To ensure greater homogeneity in performance evaluation across comparable units, and taking into account sample size variations, we focus on examining the productivity change only for regional hospitals. There are 31 regional hospitals (15 public hospitals and 16 private hospitals joined the TQIP program in 2000) that provided complete data on acute care indicators for the years in the pre-TQIP period (1998) and in the post-TQIP period (2002 and 2004 ). 2 In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) originated in Hong Kong and China. Taiwan also had 664 cases, including 346 contagions and 73 dead. SARS had an important impact on healthcare and economics for Taiwan. Our study focuses on the changes in quality and productivity consequent to the adoption of TQIP, and we use the Malmquist productivity change index and its components to evaluate these changes from the pre-TQIP to the post-TQIP periods (1998-2002 and 1998-2004 ).",

The quality level, measured by the number of net inpatient mortalities, is an outcome healthcare quality indicator. The total inpatient mortality is a critical and readily available indicator and exhibits several healthcare qualities. Therefore, the mortality rate is a concern not only for patients, but also for insurance companies, and the public health authorities. Note that rather than using the total inpatient mortality, we have only taken the mortality of ambulatory patients after 48 hours duration, and excluded emergency room mortality, stillbirths, and early neonatal deaths as the net inpatient mortality. However, the net inpatient mortality number is identified as bad (undesirable) output. If we treat the output as input, the resulting DEA model does not reflect the true production process. We thus adopt Seiford and Zhu [54] that multiplied each bad output by ''-1'' and apply a proper translation vector to let all negative bad output be positive. After linear monotone decreasing transformation, the inputs and outputs fit the isotonity and convexity relations in DEA application. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for hospital inputs and outputs for the pre-TQIP period (1998) and post-TQIP period (2002 and 2004) . The means of inputs and outputs all increased from pre-TQIP period to post-TQIP period. The number of net inpatient mortality (a) is identified as bad (undesirable) output. The healthcare quality improves as the number of net inpatient mortality decreases relative to the other desirable output increases. In the pre-TQIP period (1998), the rates of the number of net inpatient mortality divided by the desirable output (number of outpatient visits, number of patients receiving surgery, or number of patient days) are 0.044%, 2.48%, and 0.193%. In the post-TQIP period (2002 and 2004) , the average rates decrease to 0.033%, 1.10%, and 0.143%. These results demonstrate healthcare quality improvement. Table 2 reports individual hospitals' productivity change, quality change, relative efficiency change, and technical change from the pre-TQIP period (1998) to the post-TQIP period (2002 and 2004) . Table 3 shows the frequency distribution of the Malmquist productivity index and other component factors contributing to the overall productivity change. From Panel A of both Tables 2 and 3, we observe that the average quality grows by 13.55% ( = 1-0.8645=0.1355) from the pre-TQIP period to the post-TQIP period (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) and only 4 hospitals' quality deteriorate. The average relative efficiency improves by 2.88% (= 1-0.9712=0.0288) and 5 hospitals' relative efficiency regress. The average technical change increases by 4.80% ( = 1-0.9520= 0.0480) and there are 20 hospitals showing progress in technical performance. The quality growth, relative efficiency improvement, and technical progress contribute to 21.23% ( = 1-0.7877= 0.2123) increase in productivity from 1998-2002. Among the productivity changes, the most important trigger derives from the quality progress (13.55%).",

In addition, the aggregate effects from the quality and efficiency progress have led to productivity growth after the TQIP adoption (0.7877, 0.8748). These evidence support H1, H2 and H3. That is, after joining TQIP, hospitals can identify the nonvalue-added process and reduce cost as well as thorough cost structure comprehension.",
