            "text": "A 1-step RT-PCR assay, targeting a 730 bp fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of bovine coronavirus (BCV), and a nested PCR assay, targeting a 407 bp fragment of the N gene, were developed to detect BCV in nasal swab and fecal samples of calves experimentally exposed to BCV. Both 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR recognized cell culture passaged isolates of 10 bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV), 5 calf diarrhea (CD) and 8 winter dysentery (WD) strains of BCV, but not transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus or bovine rotavirus. The sensitivity of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR was compared to that of an antigen-capture ELISA. The lowest detection limit of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR as determined by using tenfold serial dilutions of the BRCV 255 and 440 strains in BCV negative nasal swab suspensions from preexposure gnotobiotic calves was 2 \u00d7 10 4 and 2 \u00d7 10 2 TCID 50 /0.1 ml for each strain, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the antigen-capture ELISA as determined by using the same serially diluted samples was 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /0.1 ml for each strain. Therefore, the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were 50 and 5000 times, respectively more sensitive than the antigen-capture ELISA to detect BRCV in nasal swab suspensions. To investigate in vivo cross-protection between the BRCV and CD or WD strains of BCV and to detect nasal and fecal shedding * Present address: of BCV using the 1-step RT-PCR, nested PCR and antigen-capture ELISA, 6 colostrum-deprived and two gnotobiotic calves were inoculated with a BRCV, a CD or a WD strain of BCV and then challenged 3-4 weeks later with either BRCV, CD or WD strains of BCV. All calves developed diarrhea after inoculation and BCV antigen (ELISA) or RNA (RT-PCR) was detected in the diarrheic fecal samples or the corresponding nasal swab samples. In addition, low amounts of BCV were also detected only by nested PCR in the fecal and nasal swab samples before and after diarrhea. No respiratory clinical signs were observed during the entire experimental period, but elevated rectal temperatures were detected during diarrhea in the BCV-inoculated calves. All calves recovered from infection with the BRCV, CD, or WD strains of BCV were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either a heterologous or homologous strain of BCV. However, all calves challenged with heterologous BCV strains showed subclinical BCV infection evident by detection of nasal and fecal shedding of BCV RNA detected only by nested PCR. Such results confirm field and experimental data documenting reinfection of the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle, suggesting that, in closed herds, respiratory or enteric tract reinfections may constitute a source of BCV transmissible to cows (WD) or neonatal or feedlot calves. In addition, the present 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were highly sensitive to detect BCV in nasal swab and fecal specimens. Therefore, these assays should be useful to diagnose BCV infections in calves and adult cows.",

The BCV possesses a single-stranded, non-segmented RNA genome of positive polarity [6] . The virion contains four major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein, the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) protein and the spike (S) protein [24] . The BCV N protein is a 50-kd phosphoprotein that binds viral genomic RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid [12] . The N protein may play a role in replication of viral RNA, since antibody directed against the N protein inhibits the in vitro RNA polymerase reaction [3] . The N protein of BCV shows an overall amino acid sequence identity of 70% with mouse hepatitis virus, a member of the same coronavirus serogroup 2, but only 29% identity with the N protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and infectious bronchitis virus, members of coronavirus serogroups 1 and 3, respectively [12] .",

Results of comparative studies indicated that coronaviruses isolated from either the intestinal or respiratory tract of calves replicated in both the intestinal and upper respiratory tracts of gnotobiotic or colostrum-deprived (Cols-D) calves [21] . Bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) strains were frequently detected by ELISA and isolated from nasal swab samples of feedlot cattle with respiratory tract disease after shipping [9, 13, 22, 25] . Thus BRCV infection may contribute to the bovine respiratory disease complex, which is the single most important syndrome affecting 6-to 10-month-old beef cattle after entry into feedlots in North America [16] . There are reports [9, 25] that BCV strains isolated from the respiratory tract had different biological and antigenic properties from BCV strains isolated from the enteric tract, whereas others reported no differences between enteric and respiratory BCV strains [18, 26] . Fukutomi et al. [8] found that the BRCV and bovine enteric coronavirus (BECV) isolated from the respiratory and enteric tracts of a cow with winter dysentery, respectively, belonged to different antigenic groups according to their reactivity against monoclonal antibodies to the spike glycoprotein. However, in another report by Zhang et al. [32] , they found a specific BRCV strain was genetically similar to enteric coronaviruses, with 98.7% nucleotide similarity of the spike gene sequence between the BRCV and BECV isolates. Others reported that calves, which recovered from infection with the CD or WD strain of BCV, were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either the CD or WD strain of BCV [7, 21] , but nasal shedding of BCV was detected in 2 of 4 calves. To our knowledge, there are no in vivo cross-protection studies between BRCV, CD and WD strains of BCV.",

Moreover, there is a report that chronic shedding of BCV in feces was observed in clinically normal cows [4] . Similarly, specificity is equally important to avoid false-positives. Silva et al. [22] reported detection of BRCV using an ELISA that demonstrated high specificity (95.4%), but lower sensitivity (76.5%). Therefore, more sensitive tests are required to detect BRCV in nasal swab samples to improve the diagnosis of BRCV infections and to examine repeat infections with homologous or heterologous BCV strains.",

We designed primers from the nucleocapsid gene of BCV because this gene is conserved among BCV strains [5] . All 5 CD, 8 WD and 10 BRCV strains were detected by RT-PCR, suggesting that the sequences of the primers used in this study were conserved among these clinically diverse BCV strains. Nested primers can further amplify the products of the RT-PCR reaction. The nested PCR primers used in this study amplified the predicted bands of 407 bp from the RT-PCR products of all 5 CD, 8 WD and 10 BRCV strains of BCV. Moreover, primers used in this study for RT-PCR and nested PCR did not amplify RNA from rotavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, mock-infected HRT-18 cells, and nasal swab and fecal samples from preexposure gnotobiotic or Cols-D calves. From these results, primers used for RT-PCR and nested PCR in this study were specific for detecting BCV including CD, WD and BRCV strains. The assay protocol to detect BCV RNA should be as simple as possible such that it could be simultaneously applied to large numbers of clinical samples. Also, if possible, radioisotopes should be avoided as they are costly and difficult to use in many diagnostic laboratories. To accommodate these requirements, the reverse transcription and PCR amplification reactions were conducted sequentially in a single tube and the PCR products were detected by ethidium bromide staining following fractionation on an agarose gel. In the present study, the 1-step RT-PCR amplification in the same tube was of similar sensitivity for detection of BCV RNA to that of RT and PCR amplification steps, which were done in different tubes. From these results, the 1-step RT-PCR assay was useful for the detection of BCV in the fecal and especially the nasal swab samples.",

By ELISA and RT-PCR, the patterns of fecal and nasal shedding of BCV observed after primary inoculation with either the BRCV 930, CD DB2, or WD DBA strains were similar to those reported in other studies of gnotobiotic, Cols-D, or field calves infected with CD or WD BCV strains [7, 10, 18, 19, 21, 26] . To our knowledge, however, there are no published studies of in vivo cross-protection between BRCV and CD or WD BCV strains. In the present study, calves that recovered from infection with BRCV, CD or WD strains of BCV were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either the BRCV, CD or WD strains of BCV. This result was consistent with previous reports in which calves recovered from primary infection with CD DB2 or WD DBA BCV strains were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either the WD DBA or CD DB2 strains of BCV [7] .",

In addition, low amounts of nasal and fecal virus shedding of BCV was observed in nasal and fecal samples obtained from inoculated calves before or after diarrhea. To confirm whether the early shedding of BCV was due to BCV RNA derived from the inoculum, a gnotobiotic calf was inoculated with inactivated BRCV 930 strain and the fecal and nasal swab samples obtained were tested by ELISA, RT-PCR and nested PCR. No BCV antigen or RNA was detected in these samples even at 1-2 PID. These results suggest that the present nested PCR assay might be useful for diagnosis of subclinical BCV infections in calves. However it is unknown if the inoculated and challenged calves shedding BCV RNA by nested PCR only are capable of transmitting BCV infection to susceptible cohorts. This should be examined in future studies. The subclinical nasal and fecal shedding of BRCV, CD and WD BCV RNA detected by nested PCR in experimentally challenge-exposed calves agrees with results of field studies that documented chronic, repeated nasal shedding of BCV by infected calves [10] and chronic fecal shedding of BCV in healthy adult cattle detected by ELISA [14] .",

Nasal and fecal shedding of BCV, which were detectable only by nested PCR, after challenge exposure confirmed field and experimental data documenting reinfection of the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle, suggesting that, in closed herds, respiratory or enteric tract reinfections may constitute a source of BCV transmission to cows (WD) or young calves.
