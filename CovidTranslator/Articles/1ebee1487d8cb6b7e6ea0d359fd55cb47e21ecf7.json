Since gamma interferon (IFN) has been implicated as an up-regulator of IgG 2 a production, attempts were made to determine whether levels of this cytokine were modified in sera of infected mice. Serum IFN-y was not detected, but treatment of MHV-JHMinfected mice with monoclonal anti-IFN-? antibody resulted in high mortality with decreased survival times, enhanced virus titers in liver and spleen, and more severe virus-associated pathology, compared to mock-treated, infected mice. Immunotherapy with recombinant IFN-7 ameliorated disease as reflected by mortality rates and virus titers in target organs.",

Gamma interferon (IFN), a cytokine preferentially produced by the Th 1 subset of CD 4 + T cells [5] , stimulates production of IgG 2 a by B lymphocytes activated in vitro and in vivo and inhibits IgG 1 secretion [12, 30, 31] .

The initial goal of the currently reported experiments was to determine whether MHV-JHM infection yielded similar results and whether timing of virus exposure was critical to observing the effect, as has been reported for other experimental systems altered by MHV infection [4, 33] . MHV-JHM infection of the BALB/c mouse was exploited as representative of a combination of moderately virulent, pantropic virus in a commonly used permissive genotype. Based on the observation of elevated ovalbumin (OVA)-specific IgG 2 a levels in sera of mice infected with MHV-JHM at any of several intervals relative to antigen exposure, attempts were made to detect IFN-7 in sera of infected mice and to reverse the IgG 2 a elevation by administration of IFN-y-specific antibody. The effect of this antibody and of immunotherapy with exogenous recombinant IFN-7 on virus-associated mortality and pathology and on virus replication in target organs was examined.",

Sera from higher proportions of mice in groups that received MHV-JHM on days -4 (83%), -1 (88%) or 0 (83%) relative to OVA contained OVA-specific IgG2a on day 7 than the proportion that were OVA-immunized, but uninfected (36%); however, these differences were not statistically significant. Mice infected four days prior to OVA administration had OVA-specific IgG 1 titers that were sevenfold lower than those of OVA-immunized, uninfected mice (Table 1) , and the proportion of IgG 1-positive sera (60%) was reduced compared to uninfected control sera (92%). Results are shown as number positive at a dilution of 1 : 50 or greater/number tested, and geometric mean enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer \u00b1 SD for positive sera Sera collected from mice at 14 days after OVA immunization yielded a more clear-cut pattern. IgG 2 a titers were elevated in sera from mice that received virus any time from seven days prior to OVA through one day after OVA ( Table 1) . As had been seen among mice bled seven days after administration of OVA, the most marked increase in OVA-specific IgG 2 a (83-fold increase over controls) occurred among mice infected one day prior to immunization. Sera from all infected mice except those exposed to virus seven days prior to immunization contained reduced levels of OVA-specific IgG 1 (Table 1) .

Athymic mice were included because they produce IFN-y by virtue of fully competent natural killer cells [-19 ]. Four mice per genotype and treatment group were necropsied daily on post-infection days one through five. Liver and spleen sections from all mice were examined histologically, and virus in the same organs of mice necropsied on days four and five post-infection was quantified. On day 4, mock-treated athymic and euthymic mice and XMG 1.2-treated euthymic mice had rare scattered foci of necrotizing hepatitis, with necrosis of hepatocytes and infiltration of neutrophilic leukocytes. XMG 1.2-treated athymic mice had hepatitis that was similar in quality to that of their mock-treated counterparts, but necrotic foci were more numerous.

Mice infected intraperitoneally with MHV-3 two or four days prior to sheep red blood cell immunization yielded depressed IgM and IgG plaque-forming cell responses [33] , whereas mice in-fected at the time of or one day after red cell administration yielded elevated plaque-forming cell responses. This could be correlated with the timing of IFNa/13 responses relative to antigen administration. More recently, intranasal administration of MHV-A 59 one day prior to tetanus toxoid immunization resulted in elevated antigen-specific IgG with a four-fold decrease in the percent of IgG that was IgG 1 and a like increase in the proportion that was IgG 2 a [7] . Our results with MHV-JHM and a different immunizing antigen confirm and extend that finding by showing elevated IgG 2 a OVA-specific responses over a wide range of infection intervals. Timing is crucial, however, to the extent that IgG 2 a titers exceeded IgG 1 titers only among mice infected one day prior to antigen administration. MHV infection reportedly increases resistance to a variety of secondary viral infections. Pre-infection of mice with MHV increased resistance to lethal Sendai virus infection in a normally susceptible genotype and interfered with replication of pneumonia virus of mice in respiratory tract tissues [4] . Subclinical MHV infection delayed increased plasma lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels resulting from LDH-elevating virus [11] . Natural, inapparent MHV infection also increased resistance to encephalomyocarditis virus and reduced the protective effect of exogenous IFN-a or -13 [9] . Since MHV infection induces IFN-(z/13 production [15, 25, 33] , it was postulated that increased resistance to these secondary infections was due to endogenous IFN-a/13 levels and that the effects of exogenous IFN were masked by the endogenous production [9] .",

Treatment of mice with a different rat antimouse IFN-~f monoclonal antibody or with a sheep-derived antibody against recombinant IFN-7 resulted in reduced clearance or enhanced replication of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice [17, 19] . Neutralization of IFN-7 in LCMV-infected athymic C57BL/6 resulted in enhanced virus replication [193 as seen in the studies reported here. More recently, a rat antimouse IFN-7 monoclonal antibody prevented IL 2-induced recovery of athymic mice infected with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding murine IL 2 [16] , suggesting that IL 2-induced IFN-7 production was responsible for rapid clearance of this construct. Virus replication and associated mortality were unaffected among anti-IFN-7-treated athymic mice infected with a control virus construct encoding HSV TK and A/PR/8/34 HA [163. However, administration of recombinant IFN-7 to mice infected with the control construct significantly increased their survival time, although all treated mice eventually died of disseminated infection [16] . Resistance of intraperitoneally inoculated A/J mice to MHV-3 also correlates with the ability of this genotype to produce IFN-7 after infection [21] . The accumulated data strongly suggest that IFN-7, whether induced during the course of infection or administered therapeutically, limits viral replication in vivo. In the case of vaccinia virus encoding IL 2, IFN-7 apparently mediates recovery of athymic mice.",

In earlier studies with LCMV [13] and the current experiments with MHV, IFN-7 was either present in very low concentration or undetected in sera of infected mice, despite the fact that anti-IFN-y treatment resulted in elevated virus titers. These observations may stem from insensitivity of the assays used to detect IFN-7. The vesicular stomatitis virus cytopathic effect reduction assay was used in the LCMV studies, and the WEHI 279 cell bioassay was used in the current experiments. The WEHI 279 cell bioassay is as sensitive as the Ia induction assay for detection of IFN-7 [24] , but sensitivity comparisons with other methods have not been reported. Use of the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as reported by Karupiah and co-workers [16] , would likely reveal the presence of IFN-7 in sera or tissue homogenates from infected mice. Based on both histologic evaluation and virus quantification, the effect of administration of anti-IFN-7 antibody was more marked in athymic than in euthymic mice. This may be due to higher endogenous concentrations of IFN-7 in euthymic mice by virtue of functional T cells as well as natural killer cells. Neither natural killer cells nor endogenous levels of IFN-7 are sufficient to afford protection, however, since athymic mice do die after natural or experimental infection with MHV [-14, 32] . MHV-JHM also kills virtually all BALB/ c mice exposed by the intranasal route. The lethal effect of infection could be partially overcome by administration of recombinant IFN-7, with a concomitant and significant decrease in virus concentration in the liver.",

            "text": "Others have postulated that virus infections preferentially activate the IFNy producing T h 1 subset of CD4 + T cells [7] , based on the fact that most infections result in enhanced IgG 2 a production. Using LDH-elevating virus or the FL strain of mouse adenovirus, attempts were made to inhibit virusassociated IgG 2 a production by injection of several different IFN-y-specific monoclonal antibodies [6] . These efforts failed, although it was not clear whether treatment simply did not affect isotype distribution or whether the mice succumbed to infection. In the current study, neutralization of IFN-7 in vivo resulted in high mortality with reduced survival times, thereby inhibiting our efforts to show a direct link between virus-induced IFN-7 production and enhanced IgG 2 a responses. Among mouse strains susceptible to MHV after exposure by natural routes, lesions and mortality occur at or near the infectious dose level, and the severity of lesions is independent of virus dose [1, 2] . In the case of MHV-JHM inoculation of the BALB/c mouse by presumed natural routes, the median infectious and lethal doses are essentially identical (unpubl. data). Therefore, subsequent studies designed to reveal whether neutralization of IFN-7 reverses preferential IgG 2 a production will require the use of mouse genotypes more resistant to the lethal effects of MHV-JHM infection [29] or of a less virulent MHV strain. Our studies with MHV-JHM in the BALB/c mouse have shown, however, that endogenous IFN-y modulates coronavirusassociated mortality, virus replication and tissue damage in a susceptible host.",
