            "text": "At the beginning of the 21st century the diagnosis of disease still requires a detailed medical history and a thorough physical examination. For the majority of patients in many areas of the world, additional information from laboratory tests and other data are of rather limited availability. Modern science and technology have changed the situation considerably in the industrialized nations, but we are paying a high price. Cost containment in health care has become essential, and physicians have to be skillful in their history taking and physical examination techniques to collect a maximum of information before ordering expensive medical-technical investigations. The relevance of these skills in pediatric respiratory medicine is exemplified by clinical severity scores that are widely used in care maps for asthma, bronchiolitis, and croup in children, or in scores developed to manage patients suspected to have severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

Young children cannot follow instructions and participate in formal physiologic testing, and physicians hesitate before subjecting their pediatric patients to invasive diagnostic procedures. Diseases of the respiratory tract are among the most common in children, and in the majority of cases they can be correctly identified from medical history data and physical findings alone. The following review of the medical history and physical examination in children with respiratory disease includes some observations that were made with the help of modern technology. These technologic aids do not lessen the value of subjective perceptions but rather emphasize how new methods may further our understanding, sharpen our senses, and thereby advance the art of medical diagnosis.",

The age at first presentation is important because respiratory diseases that manifest soon after birth are more likely to have been inherited or to be related to congenital malformations. Depending on the duration of symptoms, the illness will be classified as acute, subacute, chronic, or recurrent. These definitions are arbitrary, but a disease of less than 3 weeks duration is generally called acute, between 3 weeks and 3 months subacute, and longer than 3 months chronic. If symptoms are clearly discontinuous, with documented intervals of well-being, the disease is recurrent. This distinction is important because many parents may perceive their child as being chronically ill, not realizing that young normal children may have six to eight respiratory infections per year, particularly during the first 2 years if the child is in a daycare setting or if they have older siblings.",

Similarly, a wood-burning stove used for indoor heating may be a contributing factor.

There may be a relationship between respiratory symptoms and daily activities. Exercise is a common trigger factor for cough and wheezing in many patients with hyperreactive airways. A walk outside in cold air may have similar effects. Diurnal variation of symptoms may be apparent, and attention should be paid to changes that occur at night. These changes may also be related to airway cooling, or they may reflect conditions that are worse in the recumbent position, such as postnasal drip or gastroesophageal reflux.

Were there any signs of neonatal respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, retractions, and cyanosis? Treatment with oxygen or endotracheal intubation should be recorded.

The physician should ask whether the child was fed by breast or bottle. For the newborn and young infant, feeding is a substantial physical exercise and may, in the presence of respiratory disease, lead to distress, much as climbing stairs does in the older patient. The question of exercise tolerance in an infant is therefore asked by inquiring how long it takes the patient to finish a meal. The caloric intake of infants with respiratory disease is often reduced despite an increased caloric need, to support the work of breathing. This reduced caloric intake commonly results in a failure to thrive. Older patients with chronic respiratory disease and productive cough may suffer from a continuous exposure of their taste buds to mucopurulent secretions and may quite understandably lose their appetites, but medical treatment (e.g., with certain antibiotics) may have similar effects. Patients with food hypersensitivity may react with bronchospasm or even with interstitial lung disease on exposure to the allergen (e.g., to milk). Physical irritation and inflammation occur if food is aspirated into the respiratory tract. This happens frequently in patients with debilitating neurologic diseases and deficient protective reflexes of the upper airways but may also occur in neurologically intact children.",

This will provide valuable information about the impact of the illness on daily routines, the financial implications, the existing or absent social support structures, and the coping strategies of the family. Compliance with medical treatment is rarely better than 50%, and physicians are generally unable to predict how well their patients follow and adhere to therapeutic regimens. Compliance can improve if the patient and the parents gain a better understanding of the disease and its treatment. It is important to recognize prior experiences that the family may have had with the health care system and to understand individual religious and health beliefs. Particularly in children with chronic respiratory ailments whose symptoms are not being controlled or prevented, the effort and unpleasantness (e.g., of chest physiotherapy) may limit the use of such interventions.

Measurements should be taken with a caliper at the level of the nipples in upright subjects. Normative values for young children are available but dated ( Fig. 6-4) . Most of the configurational change of the chest occurs during the first 2 years and is probably influenced by gravitational forces after the upright position becomes common. Disease-related changes in thoracic dimensions occur either as potential causative factors (e.g., the elongated thorax with a stress distribution that favors spontaneous pneumothorax in lanky adolescents, particularly males who increase their thoracic height vs. width more than females) or as a secondary event (e.g., the barrel-shaped chest in patients with emphysema and chronic hyperinflation of the lung). Inspection of the patient should also be directed to the extrathoracic regions. Many observations on the examination of the head and neck provide valuable clues to the physical diagnosis. Bluish coloration of the lower eyelid (\"allergic shiners\"); a bilateral fold of skin just below the lower eyelid (Dennie lines); and a transverse crease from \"allergic salutes,\" running at the junction of the cartilaginous and bony portion of the nose, may all be found in atopic individuals. The nose should always be examined, and bilateral patency should be documented by occluding each side while feeling and listening for airflow through the other nostril. Even without a speculum one can assess the anterior half by raising the nose tip with one thumb and shining a light into the nasal passageways. Color and size of the mucosa should be noted. The frequency of asymptomatic nasal polyps seems to be high. Most polyps arise from the mucosa of the ostia, clefts, and recesses in the ostiomeatal complex.

A dominant source of tracheal breath sounds is turbulence from the jet flow at the glottic aperture. However, narrow segments of the supraglottic passages also contribute to sound generation. There is a very close relationship between airflow and tracheal sound intensity, particularly at high frequencies. In the presence of local narrowing (e.g., in children with subglottic stenosis), flow velocity at the stenotic site is increased, and so is the tracheal sound intensity. Relating tracheal sound levels to airflow measured at the mouth can provide information about changes during therapy.

There is a distinct pause between the respiratory phases. Expiration is louder than inspiration, and resonance is apparent around 700 Hz. In this example, the subject was holding his breath at the beginning. During this respiratory pause, heart sounds below 200 Hz are easily identified by their temporal relation to the simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram (ECG). prominent effects on lung sounds and gas density effects are less obvious. Inspiratory lung sounds show little contribution of noise generated at the glottis. Their origin is likely more peripheral (i.e., in the main and segmental bronchi). Expiratory lung sounds appear to have a central origin and are probably affected by flow convergence at airway bifurcations ( Fig. 6-6 ).",

This information cannot be gathered on subjective auscultation but requires objective acoustic measurements. A trained ear, however, will recognize many of the findings that are related to these mechanisms. For example, lung sounds in healthy children and adults are not necessarily equal at corresponding sites over both lungs. In fact, expiratory sounds are typically louder at the right upper lobe compared with the left side. Similar asymmetry has been recognized when sound is introduced at the mouth and measured at the chest surface. A likely explanation for this asymmetry is the effect on sound propagation by the cardiovascular and mediastinal structures to the left of the trachea. Asymmetry of lung sounds is also noticeable in most healthy subjects during inspiration when one listens over the posterior lower chest. The left side tends to be louder here, probably because of the size and spatial orientation of the larger airways due to the heart.",

It is therefore not correct to speak of local \"air entry\" when one actually refers to local breath sound intensity. Decreased breath sounds, for example, are common in asthma even when normal blood gases indicate that air entry has to be adequate. Obviously, a qualitative distinction between absence or presence of local breath sounds will be easier than attempts at quantification. Also, when the stethoscope is placed over any given location, it is not known how large an area of the underlying lung is actually being assessed. In adult subjects, moving the chest piece of the stethoscope by 10 cm will position it to receive sound from entirely different lung units, but similar data for children are not available. Assessment of regional ventilation by thoracic acoustic signs becomes more meaningful when two sites are compared simultaneously. Differential auscultation with special stethoscopes that employ two chest pieces or a single divided chest piece has not become popular in clinical practice. Comparative auscultation is absolutely essential for airway management in the emergency room and intensive care unit for assessment of endotracheal tube position or for identification of the side of a pneumothorax. Listening simultaneously to two homologous sites over both lungs may also help to detect local abnormalities. Atelectatic areas will transmit sound more slowly than inflated lung tissue, but the resulting phase shift is too small to be detectable on subjective auscultation. With local airway narrowing, however, the maximum sound intensity over the affected side may become sufficiently delayed to be perceived as \"phase heterophony.\" In some cases, breath sounds may still be audible over the affected side after inspiratory efforts have ceased. This \"posteffort\" breath sound is a sign of incomplete airway obstruction.",

When asking the patient or the parents about wheezing and stridor, one should keep in mind that the use of lung sound terminology among nonprofessionals is no better standardized than it is among health care providers. Therefore, the physician should inquire about musical, whistling noises during respiration, and, if necessary, demonstrate stridor or the forced expiratory wheeze that can be produced even by healthy individuals.",

Box 6-2 lists conditions other than asthma that may be associated with wheezing and stridor. The wheezing typical in asthma originates from oscillations of airways at many sites. On auscultation, one hears many different tones simultaneously, which is called polyphonic wheezing. Obstruction of a single airway can produce a single monophonic wheeze or, in the obstruction of extrathoracic airways, stridor. Both inspiratory and expiratory wheezes are present in the majority of asthmatic patients. The audible expiratory phase (expirium) is typically prolonged because of wheezing. Objectively measured expiratory time (expiration), however, is rarely prolonged except in very severe airway obstruction. Under these circumstances, airflow is minimal, and thus wheezing is absent. Respiration becomes ominously silent, and the patient may have carbon dioxide retention and cyanosis. In less severe cases, however, the proportion of inspiration and expiration occupied by wheezing correlates to some extent with the degree of airflow obstruction. Objective and reproducible wheeze quantification can be achieved by computer-assisted techniques, but in practice the quantification of wheezing severity is made by subjective assessment at the bedside.",

Tracheal auscultation to determine if and when there is wheezing after methacholine inhalation challenge has been advocated instead of spirometry in young children who are thought to have bronchial hyperreactivity. However, wheezing may be absent even if airways become significantly obstructed during bronchial provocation (Fig. 6-12) . In our experience, wheezing heard at the chest but not necessarily at the trachea is very suggestive of airway narrowing and hyperresponsiveness. Listening to respiratory sounds over the neck may help to identify patients who are thought to be asthmatic but who generate the wheezing noises solely in the larynx.

Patients with decreased cardiac output and poor peripheral perfusion can be cyanotic despite normal arterial hemoglobin saturation. Some patients may become cyanotic only during exercise, a not uncommon response when restrictive lung disease reduces the pulmonary capillary bed and the transit time of erythrocytes becomes too short for full saturation during episodes of increased cardiac output. Congenital heart disease in infants may lead to differential cyanosis, which affects only the lower part of the body (e.g., in patients with preductal coarctation of the aorta).

Pulse oximetry, however, will not take into account the presence of abnormal hemoglobin. For example, in methemoglobinemia the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood is reduced and patients may appear lavender blue, but pulse oximetry may overestimate oxygen saturation in arterial blood (SaO 2 ). The blood of newborn infants, conversely, can be well saturated and not cyanotic at lower arterial oxygen tensions because of the different oxygen-binding curve of fetal hemoglobin. In the patient with hypoxemia who does not present with cyanosis (e.g, the anemic patient), the physician has to pay particular attention to other clinical signs and symptoms of hypoxia. These include tachypnea and tachycardia, exertional dyspnea, hypertension, \u25a0 FIGURE 6-13. Cyanosis requires at least 30 g/L of reduced hemoglobin (Hgb) in arterial blood or 4 to 6 g/100 mL in capillary blood. The arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) at which cyanosis occurs is dependent on the amount of total Hgb. As illustrated, a child with 30 g/L of Hgb plus 110 g/L of oxyhemoglobin has an SaO 2 of 78%. In the anemic patient (i.e., total Hgb of 80 g/L with Hgb of 30 g/L), SaO 2 will drop much lower (to less than 65% in this example) before cyanosis occurs, whereas in the patient with polycythemia (i.e., total Hgb of 200 g/L), cyanosis appears at a higher SaO 2 (85%). headache, and behavioral changes. With more severe hypoxia there may be visual disturbance, somnolence, hypotension, and ultimately coma. In addition, the patient may have an elevated level of carbon dioxide. Depending on how rapidly and to what extent the level of carbon dioxide has risen, the clinical signs of hypercarbia will largely reflect vascular dilatation.

Vascular endothelial growth factor from the continued impaction of shunted megakaryocytes and platelets in the digital vasculature, potentiated by hypoxia, is considered to drive the cellular and stromal changes in clubbing.

Interestingly, even long-standing finger clubbing seems to resolve in patients after successful heart and lung transplantation. In patients with cystic fibrosis, progression of finger clubbing suggests a suboptimal control of chest infections. It is therefore useful to quantify the degree of digital clubbing. Measurements have focused on the hyponychial (Lovibond) angle and on the phalangeal depth ratio (Fig. 6-14) . Changes of the hyponychial angle are quantified on \"shadowgrams\"-projections of the finger's lateral profile onto a magnifying screen-whereas the phalangeal depth ratio is measured from plaster casts.

During this stage, cardiac auscultation may be normal or may reveal an increased pulmonary component of the second heart sound, caused by an increase in diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure. The physician should look for a parasternal right ventricular heave. As pulmonary hypertension progresses, there is an increase in right ventricular end-diastolic volume. Dilation of the main pulmonary artery and right ventricular outflow tract lead to systolic pulmonary ejection clicks and murmurs. Diastolic murmurs appear when pulmonary or tricuspid valves or both become insufficient. Third and fourth heart sounds at the left lower sternal border are signs of decreased right ventricular compliance.

Increased respiratory resistance may exaggerate the normal inspiratoryexpiratory difference in left ventricular stroke volume. This is mediated by effects of intrathoracic pressures on ventricular preload. Clinically, pulsus paradoxus is first assessed by palpation of the radial pulse and then is measured at the brachial artery with a sphygmomanometer as the difference in systolic pressure between inspiration and expiration. The pressure cuff is deflated from above systolic level, and the highest pressure during expiration at which systolic pulse sounds are heard is recorded. Similarly, the highest pressure at which every pulse is just audible throughout inspiration is also noted. In general, a drop of greater than 10 mm Hg during inspiration is taken as clinically significant but only a severe paradox of greater than 24 mm Hg is a reliable indicator of severe asthma. The poor correlation between pulsus paradoxus and objective measurements of airflow obstruction may be explained by other factors that affect pleural pressure swings (e.g., the degree of pulmonary hyperinflation and the airflow rate). Furthermore, the accurate measurement of pulsus paradoxus is a challenge in tachypneic, tachycardic, and uncooperative young children. A work group on behalf of the British Thoracic Society Standards of Care Committee found pulsus paradoxus to be absent in one third of patients with the severest obstruction. In contrast to North American practice guidelines, it was therefore recommended that pulsus paradoxus be abandoned as an indicator of severity of asthma attack. In children, wheeze seems to be the clinical parameter of respiratory severity scores that correlates best with pulsus paradoxus, most likely because wheeze requires critical intrathoracic pressures. Perhaps the application of new plethysmographic methods using pulse oximeters will improve the diagnostic value of this clinical sign.",
