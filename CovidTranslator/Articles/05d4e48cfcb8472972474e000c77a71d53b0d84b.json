Patients tested were children and adults with different pathological diseases. Antibody detection was performed by using an indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique (gor all viruses) and, in the case of OC43 and NCDCV, antibody detection was obtained even with a ,hemagglutination inhibition test and a plaque reduction neutralization assay. Results obtained show a significant difference in the prevalence of antibody to 229E bet~Teen children and adult group. Furthermore, a different tirer was observed, within the two groups, between patients affected by hematological diseases (leukemia) and patients w&h other diseases.
