To date, experiments with EBOV Makona have not detected evidence for increased replication phenotypes. Studies in primates and in immunodeficient mice, for example, failed to detect increased virulence with EBOV Makona compared to EBOV Mayinga, the 1976 reference isolate (Marzi et al., 2015; Smither et al., 2016) . Likewise, the EBOV Makona immunomodulatory proteins VP35 and VP24 inhibited interferon signaling to the same extent as the analogous proteins encoded by EBOV from previous outbreaks (Dunham et al., 2015) . These studies, however, examined only the early reference EBOV Makona isolate from Kissidougou, Guinea (C-15), and did not address possible changes in the virus over the course of the epidemic.",

            "text": "The large number of human-to-human transmissions of EBOV Makona during the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic provided greater opportunity for EBOV to adapt to the human host than in any previous outbreak. As expected for an RNA virus, monitoring over the course of the EVD epidemic revealed mutations throughout the genome of EBOV Makona (Carroll et al., 2015; Gire et al., 2014; Simon-Loriere et al., 2015) . However, except for the mucin-like domain in the glycoprotein (GP), which is under diversifying selection by the host humoral immune system, most of the EBOV genome exhibited purifying selection (Park et al., 2015) . Although most nonsynonymous mutations detected during the epidemic probably had little effect on viral fitness, it is possible that some of these mutations proliferated because they conferred an advantage to the virus. One such candidate is the clade-defining A82V substitution in EBOV Makona GP, which emerged at a time in the epidemic just before the number of EVD cases increased exponentially. This mutation is particularly intriguing because it is located in the receptor-binding domain of EBOV GP. Here we describe our efforts to determine whether GP-A82V conferred a replication advantage to the virus.",

The tree demonstrated two distinct lineages ( Figure 1A ). The first lineage consisted of 86 sequences and was largely confined to the region around Conakry, Guinea. The second lineage formed a monophyletic clade comprised of 1,403 genomes sampled between March 2014 and August 2015. The second lineage included EBOV from all countries affected by the epidemic and was largely defined by two mutations: a non-synonymous C-to-T substitution at nucleotide 6,283, resulting in the GP-A82V substitution, and a synonymous T-to-C substitution at nucleotide 1,849, which encodes amino acid D460 of the viral NP. In addition to being present in the vast majority of EBOV infections during the 2013-2016 epidemic, the GP-A82V mutant was of interest because residue 82 is located at the receptor binding interface (Gong et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) .",

Aside from GP-A82V, T230A was the most frequently observed nonsynonymous mutation (2.5%) outside of the mucin-like domain. Four isolates from the GP-A82V/T230A sub-lineage possessed an additional A-to-G substitution at nucleotide 7,947 that resulted in the triple mutant, GP-A82V/T230A/D637G.

EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses were enriched by acceleration through a 25% sucrose cushion, and virion-associated proteins were analyzed by western blotting, using polyclonal antiserum against a V5 epitope tag that was appended to the carboxyl terminus of the GP. GP is cleaved by furin into two components, GP1 and GP2, and our western blot showed two distinct bands. One band was 70 kDa, consistent in size with full-length GP, either uncleaved by furin or GP1+GP2 covalently bound by disulfide linkages ( Figure 2D ). The second band was 25 kDa, consistent with the furin-processed GP2 product. GP1 + GP2 band intensity was compared to the intensity of the lentivirion capsid core (p24). All GPs showed equivalent levels of incorporation into particles, indicating that the enhanced infectivity observed in human cells with the GP-A82V-containing EBOV GPs was not due to differ-ences in protein synthesis, processing, or GP incorporation into lentiviral particles.",

Noda et al., 2002) . VP40 is also sufficient for incorporation of EBOV GP into the virion membrane, such that the resulting particles are capable of bona fide receptor-mediated entry into target cell cytoplasm. To facilitate quantitation of EBOV GPmediated entry, EBOV VP40 fused to b-lactamase was used to generate VLPs. These VLPs were used to infect target cells, and subsequently target cells were loaded with a fluorogenic substrate that is trapped within the target cell cytoplasm. The substrate can be cleaved only if the GP successfully attaches, binds, and triggers fusion, releasing b-lactamase-VP40 into the cytoplasm (Manicassamy and Rong, 2009; Tscherne et al., 2010 ). This experimental system does not require transcription of reporter genes, and therefore more directly tests whether the EBOV GP mutants increase the ability of EBOV VP40 cores to enter into the target cell cytoplasm. b-lactamase-containing VLPs bearing ancestral or mutant EBOV GPs were incubated with U2OS target cells, and then cells were loaded with the fluorogenic substrate. GP-A82V-or GP-A82V/T230A-bearing particles exhibited a significant increase in entry as compared with the ancestral EBOV GP (Figure 3 ).

In terms of how V82 is likely to affect the viral GP, our modeling suggests that the GP-A82V mutation will have little impact on the a1 helix backbone itself. Rather, the additional alkane branches in the side chain of valine compared to alanine may differentially impact neighboring amino acids such as the arginine at residue 85 (Figures 5B and 5C) . R85 extends into a charged pocket present on the opposite side of the a1 helix to where NPC1 interaction occurs and the nitrogens of the terminal guanidinium group are likely to form ionic interactions with the sidechains of E178, Y109, and the backbone hydroxyl group of A76.

This data recapitulated the skew (82V > 82A) that was seen in EBOV GP genotype prevalence per country depicted in Figure 1 (Figure 6A ). Further analysis was restricted to those cases for which data were available regarding all four parameters: viral load, mortality, sampling location, and viral genotype (Carroll et al., 2015; Gire et al., 2014; Quick et al., 2016) . All but 15 of these 194 cases occurred in Guinea, so the analysis was further restricted to Guinea, with samples from 19 districts. After paring down the data, geographic differences in the prevalence of viral genotypes remained ( Figure 6B ).",

When we added multiple potential confounding factors, including geographic variation in base fatality rate and access to health care, to the model, they had little effect on the conclusion. We found only modest evidence of geographic variation ( Figure S1 ), while including the cumulative number of EVD cases per region (a proxy for EVD-associated burdens on the health care infrastructure) failed to improve model fit ( Figure S1 ).

Emergence of human viral disease from a reservoir host is a major route of virus transmission, as has been documented for human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2), severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus (SARS-CoV), influenza virus, dengue virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and Marburg virus (Parrish et al., 2008) . Because of shared co-evolutionary history, zoonotic viruses are thought to replicate and transmit more efficiently in their reservoir hosts than in humans. In a new host, although productive infection may occur, differences in key host factors between cells of the reservoir versus those of the new host can impair important events such as receptor binding and entry, replication of the viral genome, virion assembly and release, and avoidance of the host innate or adaptive immune response. More efficient receptor utilization in the new host is a common route of adaptation and has been described for SARS CoV (Li et al., 2005) and numerous influenza strains (Herfst et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2012; Matrosovich et al., 2000; Stevens et al., 2006a Stevens et al., , 2006b Xu et al., 2010) . These experimental findings involving influenza have allowed for more informed surveillance of the animal reservoirs as well as providing a better understanding of the ongoing viral evolution in humans (Dugan et al., 2008; Holmes et al., 2005; Nelson et al., 2008; Obenauer et al., 2006; Rambaut et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2012) . The knowledge that EBOV GP mutations that modulate fusion to host cells may be a route for human adaptation, and which GP residues mediate this adaptation is potentially valuable knowledge for surveillance activities during future EBOV epidemics.",

However, there are likely to be differences in how the alanine and valine side chains pack against neighboring amino acids. Valine contains more alkane branches than alanine, which would place the side chain in closer proximity to GP-R85 and -W86. Steric hindrance between V82 and R85 may alter a predicted salt bridge between R85 and E178 ($2.7 \u00c5 apart, Figure 5 ). In addition, the added ''bulk'' of the GP-A82V mutation may alter the a1 helix conformation, to provide better access for proximal resides, such as GP-V79, -P80, -T83, and -W86, to interact with NPC1 . Compared to the human NPC1 loop 2 domain, the inclusion of hydrophobic side chains at site 499 (valine or isoleucine) in other mammals (non-primates) probably adds more bulk near the backbone, potentially restricting how the loop can adapt to new conformations. Primates also possess a phenylalanine at amino acid 504, while several other species have a tyrosine.",

The GP-A82V mutation was first sampled on March 31, 2014 (Data S1), after only approximately 110 EVD cases (CDC, 2016) . Our data show that GP-A82V increases infectivity of EBOV for a variety of human cells in tissue culture and is associated with increased mortality in humans. Although significant questions remain, our findings raise the possibility that this mutation contributed directly to greater transmission and thus to the severity of the outbreak. It is difficult to draw any conclusion about this hypothesis, though, since the frequency increase can also be attributed to stochastic effects, including founder effects as EBOV moved from Guinea into Sierra Leone and multiple re-introductions of GP-A82V back into Guinea. In any case, the early emergence of GP-A82V highlights the need for vigorous surveillance and rapid public health intervention after identification of EVD and other emerging infectious diseases, in order to limit the possibility of viral adaptation to humans. Finally, studies such as this are necessary, as they provide vital biological information crucial for the interpretation of viral sequence evolution. Having this connection between viral genotype and phenotype maximizes the utility of viral sequencing efforts during outbreaks, allowing more efficient targeting of intervention strategies.",

The following primers were utilized for generating these mutations: A82V F: 5 0 -CAACTGACGTGCCATCTGTGACTAAAAGATGGGGCTTC-3 0 , A82V R: 5 0 -GAAGCCCCATCTTTTAGTCACAGATGGCACGTCAGTTG-3 0 , T230A F: 5 0 -CCGGTTTTGGAACTAATGAGGCAGAGTACTTGTTC GAGG-3 0 , T230A R: 5 0 -CCTCGAACAAGTACTCTGCCTCATTAGTTCCAAAACCGG-3 0 , D637G F: 5 0 -GATAAAACCCTTCCGGGC CAGGGGGACAATGACAATTG-3 0 , and D637G R: 5 0 -CAATTGTCATTGTCCCCCTGGCCCGGAAGGGTTTTATC-3 0 . Additional derivatives of the ancestral and mutant glycoproteins were generated by removal of the stop codon (F: 5 0 -CTGTATATGCAAAT TTGTCTTTTCTAGAGTCGGGGCGGCC-3 0 , R: 5 0 -GGCCGCCCCGACTCTAGAAAAGACAAATTTGCATATACAG-3 0 ) and insertion of an XbaI-flanked C-terminal V5 tag synthesized as a gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies).",

We also allowed each location to have its own coefficient for the cumCases variables, such that the structure of the model allowed for variability in how locations responded to demand for health care.

Virus was pelleted through the sucrose cushion by spinning at 125,000 x g using SW55Ti buckets in an Optima XE-90 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN).

EBOV VLP fusion data was assessed for statistical significance using One-way Anova, with Bartlett's post-test comparing all derivative GPs to the ancestral GP.

We find that the variability in the data and possibly the relatively small number of observations lead to very broad estimates of the model parameters.

Cells were then washed once with ice cold HBSS and loaded with the CCF4-AM substrate, according to the manufacturer's protocol (ThermoFisher) with the following modifications: the inhibitor of anion transport, probenecid, was added to a final concentration of 250 mM and cells were incubated with CCF4-AM substrate overnight at 11 C. Cleavage of the CCF4-AM substrate was assessed using the Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) with the following filter settings for the cleaved substrate: 400/30 excitation and 460/40 emission. The amount of CCF4-AM cleavage in cells infected with each mutant Ebola virus GP was compared to that observed for the ancestral GP, similar to what was done for infectivity assays",
