'Fit check' is the term used to describe the process by which healthcare workers self check the fit of their respirator to ensure the respirator is sealed over the bridge of the nose and mouth and that there are no gaps between the respirator and the face. 4 'Fit test' is the term used to describe a procedure identifying which size and style of P2 respirator is suitable for an individual and ensuring that it is worn correctly.",

Quantitative fit testing methods are considered the gold standard method and measure leakage into the respirator. 5 Methods for quantitative fit testing are described in AS/NZS 1715 : 2009 and require the use of specialised equipment by a trained operator. The qualitative fit testing procedure is most commonly used in healthcare settings and is a pass/fail test to assess respirator fit, based on an individual's response to a test agent. Qualitative fit testings require the purchase and use of fit testing solutions and associated equipment. Although fast and simple to do, qualitative fit tests have the limitation of being influenced by the wearer. If used in high volume, the solutions used in qualitative fit testing are expensive and may not be readily available, as was our experience in Tasmania during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The aim of this study is to determine, when undertaking qualitative fit testing, if there is any difference in performance between a commercially available fit testing solution, a fit testing solution made locally and a placebo.",

A threshold test was then performed on the participant who was also blinded to the solution used. A threshold test determines the participants' ability to taste a weak solution of the challenge agent. 8 This procedure involved spraying the threshold solution into a hood worn by the participant until the solution could be tasted or until 30 sprays were administered. Participants were asked if they could taste anything throughout the procedure. The threshold number (number of sprays) was recorded. If the participant could taste the solution, they were deemed to have passed the threshold test. If the participant could not taste the solution, they were deemed to have failed.",

There are two main points of interest from this study, which could lead to further debate and discussion. First, 17% of participants could taste the placebo. Second, the commercial product and the homemade product performed almost identically at both the threshold and fit testing stages of this procedure. The first point of interest relates to the broader issue of the efficacy of qualitative fit testing and it is not the purpose of this paper to explore this. This issue, coupled with decisions around which respirator to use in a given situation are debated elsewhere. [9] [10] [11] [12] Findings from this study suggest that it is possible to make a homemade fit testing solution simply by using readily available artificial sweeteners. Such a finding needs to be replicated in larger size studies, using different research designs and different masks. Nonetheless, this study tests a novel process of using homemade fit testing solutions. Furthermore, should another pandemic occur and fit testing solutions become unavailable when qualitative fit testing is required, we provide an alternative that appears to be comparable to a commercially available product.",
