Here, we dissect the contributions of the individual complement activation pathways to the protection from WNV disease. Genetic defi ciencies in C1q, C4, factor B, or factor D all resulted in increased mortality in mice, suggesting that all activation pathways function together to limit WNV spread. In the absence of alternative pathway complement activation, WNV disseminated into the central nervous system at earlier times and was associated with reduced CD8 + T cell responses yet near normal anti-WNV antibody profi les.",

Complement activation through the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways induces several protective functions including direct pathogen opsonization and/or lysis, and enhancement of B and T responses (1) . Through these innate and adaptive responses complement contributes to the development of immunity against some enveloped DNA and RNA viruses (2) (3) (4) (5) . Several of these viruses have been shown to trigger distinct pathways of complement activation in vitro. Glycoproteins of murine leukemia, HIV, and human T cell lymphotropic viruses directly interact with C1q to activate the classical pathway (6) . Carbohydrates on the structural proteins of HSV, hepatitis B, and infl uenza viruses bind mannose binding lectins (MBLs) and activate the lectin pathway (7, 8) . Multiple viruses activate the alternative pathway, including Sindbis (9) , Sendai (10), measles (11, 12) , and Epstein Barr viruses (13) . However, the in vivo contribution of each complement activation pathway to the development of antiviral immunity has yet to be defi ned.",

WNV cycles in nature between mosquitoes and birds, but also infects human, horses, and other vertebrates. The virus is endemic in parts of Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, and has become established in North America. Infected humans generally develop a febrile illness, with a subset progressing to severe neurological disease. The elderly and patients with impaired immune systems are at greatest risk for the severe neurological manifestations of disease. Experiments in mice have begun to elucidate how an impaired host immune response results in severe WNV infection. An intact innate and adaptive immune response is required to limit central nervous system (CNS) infection as mice defi cient in type I IFN, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, B cells, soluble IgM, and CD8 + T cells are all highly susceptible to lethal infection (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) .

To confi rm that complement activation occurs in vivo after WNV infection, we compared the levels of functional C3 and C4 in the serum of naive and WNVinfected C57BL/6 mice using an erythrocyte hemolysis assay ( Fig. 1 A) . On day 2 after WNV infection, a time point at which peak viremia was observed (see Fig. 3 A), a 2.5-fold decrease in C3 functional activity (P < 0.0001) was measured. Signifi cant decreases, albeit smaller, were also noted on days 4 and 6 after infection (P \u2264 0.02). C4 activity (23) was also reduced at day 2 after WNV infection (Fig. 1 B) . As the catabolism of C3 in vivo generates a C3dg fragment, Western blot analysis was performed on serum from WNV-infected mice with an anti-C3 antibody. Increased levels of the 38-kD C3dg fragment were observed in serum at day 2 after WNV infection ( Fig. 1 C) ; the identity of this fragment was confi rmed by its absence from serum of congenic C3defi cient mice.

            "text": "To assess the mechanism of complement-mediated protection from WNV disease and the function of the classical, classical and lectin, or alternative pathways of complement activation in control of WNV, we evaluated morbidity and mortality in wild-type and congenic C1q \u2212/\u2212 , C4 \u2212/\u2212 , factor D (fD) \u2212/\u2212 , and factor B (fB) \u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice. Mice in all groups exhibited clinical signs of infection including weight loss, hunching, fur ruffl ing, and decreased activity. However, mice defi cient in any individual complement activation pathway were more vulnerable to infection and had higher mortality rates compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2) . Whereas only 35% of wild-type C57BL/6 mice succumbed to infection, 83% of C1q \u2212/\u2212 (n = 60, P < 0.0001), 100% of C4 \u2212/\u2212 (n = 38, P < 0.0001), 74% of fD \u2212/\u2212 , (n = 57, P = 0.0004), and 96% of fB \u2212/\u2212 (n = 51, P < 0.0001) mice died after WNV infection (Fig. 2) . Not all complement defi ciencies were associated with enhanced susceptibility as infection of mice defi cient in the C5a receptor (C5aR) survived at rates similar to wild-type mice (n = 50, P = 0.5). Although both fB and fD are components of the alternative pathway, a defi -ciency of fB caused greater mortality after WNV infection (P < 0.0001), possibly caused by residual alternative pathway activation in fD \u2212/\u2212 mice (24) . Overall, the C4 \u2212/\u2212 and fB \u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to lethal WNV infection than either C1q \u2212/\u2212 or fD \u2212/\u2212 mice (P < 0.0001). The increased susceptibility of fB \u2212/\u2212 mice was also refl ected by a decrease in the mean time to death from 10.9 \u00b1 0.3 d for wild-type mice to 9.7 \u00b1 0.1 d for the fB \u2212/\u2212 mice (P = 0.002). No statistically signifi cant decrease in the mean time to death was observed for C4 \u2212/\u2212 (10.3 \u00b1 0.2 d), C1q \u2212/\u2212 (11.7 \u00b1 0.2 d), or fD \u2212/\u2212 (11.0 \u00b1 0.2 d) mice. Thus, defi ciencies in all complement activation pathways resulted in increased mortality after WNV infection. The most severe phenotypes were observed in mice that had a combined defi ciency in the classical and lectin pathways (C4 \u2212/\u2212 ) or a complete defi ciency in the alternative pathway (fB \u2212/\u2212 ).",

Compared with wild-type mice, we observed a slight delay in clearance of WNV from the spleen in a subset of fD \u2212/\u2212 and fB \u2212/\u2212 mice. At day 6 after infection, 58% (7 of 12) and 73% (11 of 15) of fD \u2212/\u2212 and fB \u2212/\u2212 mice, respectively, had detectable infectious WNV in the spleen, whereas only 33% (5 of 15) of wild-type mice had infectious virus at this time point. On day 8 after infection 57% (8 of 14) of fB \u2212/\u2212 mice still had measurable infectious virus in the spleen, whereas it was no longer detectable in wild-type mice. Surprisingly, infectious virus was never recovered from the spleens of C1q \u2212/\u2212 mice at any point during the time course (n \u2265 11 for each time point). Consistent with this, at the peak of viral replication in the spleen, 120,000-fold lower levels of WNV RNA were detected by quantitative RT-PCR from the spleens of C1q \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wildtype mice (Fig. 3 C, P = 0.002). The peak viral burden and number of positive samples in the spleen also was signifi cantly lower in the absence of C4 (P = 0.04). Whereas 80% (12 of 15) of wild-type spleen samples were positive for infectious virus at day 4 after infection, only 30% (4 of 12) from C4 \u2212/\u2212 mice had infectious virus. Moreover, on day 6 after infection 60,000-fold lower levels of WNV RNA were detected in spleens of C4 \u2212/\u2212 mice (P = 0.001). Thus, in the spleen, classical pathway activation appears to be necessary for productive infection, whereas the alternative pathway contributes in part to its rapid clearance of WNV.",

Additionally, whereas 100% of complement-defi cient mice exhibited WNV invasion of the spinal cord by day 10 after infection, only 73% (11 of 15) of wild-type mice had infectious WNV in the spinal cord at this time point. These results suggest that the diff erent complement activation pathways modulate the entry and accumulation of WNV in the spinal cord.",

WNV infection activates the complement system in vivo, and all three complement activation pathways are required for protection against WNV. However, diff erences in priming of adaptive immune responses to WNV were observed in mice lacking individual components of all three pathways of complement activation. Defi ciencies in the alternative pathway were associated with slightly delayed splenic clearance, blunted T cell responses, yet near normal anti-WNV antibody profi les. Defi ciencies in classical and lectin pathway activation were associated with decreased splenic infection and signifi cant defi cits in both B and T cell responses against WNV. A defi ciency in the classical pathway alone was associated with markedly decreased splenic infection, yet normal T cell responses and near normal antibody responses. Importantly, not all defects in the complement system predispose mice to enhanced WNV susceptibility, as mice lacking the C5aR exhibited no increase in mortality after infection. This latter result was not unexpected as C5aR activity primarily modulates granulocyte responses, a cell type that has not been implicated in the pathogenesis or immune response to WNV infection (29) .",

Although the studies in C3 \u2212/\u2212 mice were consistent with models of complementdependent control of other viral infections including HSV, infl uenza, and LCMV (2-4, 31, 32) , no investigation had systematically addressed how the diff erent activation pathways coordinate protection. Our experiments demonstrate that all complement activation pathways are required for control of severe WNV disease. The virologic experiments suggest that complement limits viral spread and facilitates clearance of WNV within the CNS. As many complement proteins are constitutively expressed within the CNS (33) and up-regulated after infection with other neurotropic viruses (34-36), complement activation in the CNS could be critical for destr uction of viral particles or virus-infected neuronal cells. Alternatively, the defects observed in priming adaptive immune responses to WNV in complement-defi cient mice (see below) may result in earlier spread and/or decreased clearance.",

Because IgM fi xes complement by the classical pathway and WNV particles can be neutralized effi ciently in vitro by exogenous rabbit complement (20), we anticipated increased viremia in C1q \u2212/\u2212 and C4 \u2212/\u2212 mice. However, we only observed a transient increase in viremia in C4 \u2212/\u2212 mice, which may be secondary to depressed levels of antiviral IgM in these mice. Viral clearance from serum is known to correlate with the induction of WNV-specifi c IgM at days 4 and 6 after infection (15) . The relatively low viral neutralizing activity of serum complement in mice may be caused by the reduced function of the mouse classical pathway C5 convertase (37, 38) . Our prior in vivo experiments support this, as antibody-mediated protection from WNV disease was not signifi cantly attenuated in C1q \u2212/\u2212 or C4 \u2212/\u2212 mice (39) .",

            "text": "A surprising result was the requirement of C1q and C4 for normal levels of WNV infection in the spleen and draining lymph node. In the absence of C1q, infectious virus was not detected in the spleen, and 100,000-fold less WNV RNA was measured on day 6 after infection. Additionally, WNV infection of the draining inguinal lymph nodes was reduced in the absence of C1q beginning on day 3 after infection. In the absence of C4, fewer spleen samples contained less infectious virus than those of wild-type animals, and less WNV RNA was detected in the spleen and draining inguinal lymph node. At fi rst glance, this observation appears consistent with earlier in vitro studies that showed complement and antiviral IgM enhanced WNV infection in macrophages (42, 43) . Although these studies suggested that IgM-dependent fi xation of C3 split products (e.g., C3b, C3dg, or iC3b) on WNV enhanced infection, our prior studies with secreted IgM \u2212/\u2212 or C3 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed normal WNV splenic infection (15, 20) . Based on this, we speculate that C1q directly or indirectly interacts with WNV to facilitate splenic infection. Direct C1q interaction with viral glycoproteins has been observed for HIV-1, human T cell lymphotropic virus-1, and Moloney murine leukemia virus (6) , and C1q-dependent enhancement of infection has been demonstrated in vitro for both HIV-1 and Ebola viruses (44, 45) . Our data clearly establishes that WNV infection in the spleen does not signifi cantly contribute to viremia or CNS seeding. Somewhat paradoxically, decreased productive splenic infection did not dramatically alter the induction of primary antiviral B and T cell immune responses to WNV. This apparently contrasts with studies which show that follicular localization in the spleen is complement dependent and required for the development of antibody responses to soluble antigen (46) and vesicular stomatitis virus (2) . For WNV, we hypothesize that T and B cell priming may occur in other secondary lymphoid tissues. Alternatively, despite an absence of productive viral infection in the spleen, suffi cient complementdependent antigen trapping occurs for antigen presentation and priming of antiviral adaptive immune responses.",

Because near normal anti-WNV antibody responses were observed in fB \u2212/\u2212 or fD \u2212/\u2212 mice, activation of the alternative pathway is not required for priming the antibody response against WNV. Our results are consistent with studies which demonstrate that fB \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit normal B cell priming to T cell-independent and T cell-dependent antigens (47) . We observed a transient delay in the development of antiviral IgG but not IgM in the absence of C1q, consistent with previous reports of defects in primary T cell-dependent IgG but not IgM responses in C1q \u2212/\u2212 mice (46) . Our data suggests the contribution of the classical pathway to anti-WNV antibody priming is relatively minor and could be secondary to the defect observed in splenic infection. The most severe defect in anti-WNV antibody development was observed in the absence of C4, where IgM responses were blunted and IgG responses were delayed. Since the C1q \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited normal IgM responses, the C4dependent lectin pathway could play an important role in priming the antiviral IgM against WNV. Although no study has directly evaluated the contribution of the lectin pathway to antiviral antibody responses, this idea is consistent with work on HSV in which both the primary and memory antiviral humoral responses were blunted in C4 \u2212/\u2212 mice (3, 48) . Defects in MBL function and lectin pathway activation have been suggested to predispose individuals to HIV-1 (49), HSV-2 (7), severe acute respiratory syndrome (50) , and chronic hepatitis B infection (51) .

T cell responses to infl uenza and LCMV require C3 activation (4, 27) , possibly by enhancing antigen uptake and presentation or T cell traffi cking to infected organs. Effi cient CD8 + CTL responses are critical for development of WNV immunity (16, 17) , and complement-defi cient mice with the greatest mortality (i.e., C4 \u2212/\u2212 and fB \u2212/\u2212 ) had associated T cell activation and traffi cking defi cits. Because previous studies with soluble antigens suggested that C1q-mediated immune complex trapping contributed to T cell priming (46, 52), we expected C1q \u2212/\u2212 mice to have T cell defi cits; however, this was not observed. We speculate that WNV antigen uptake and presentation may be reduced in the absence of lectin pathway activity and/or C4b deposition. Lectin pathway recognition induces opsonization of infl uenza virus, HSV-2, and HIV-1 (53) , and C4b deposition and CR1 binding can activate and enhance antigen presentation in human cells (54) . Nonetheless, the defects in antiviral T cell responses in C4 \u2212/\u2212 mice could be indirect and attributed to the depressed anti-WNV IgM responses and decreased immune complex clearance. Although more experiments are necessary to identify the exact mechanism, our study is novel as it describes a role for C4 in T cell function after viral infection. We also observed a requirement for the alternative pathway in the development of T cell responses after WNV infection. Because others have demonstrated an 80% reduction in classical pathway-dependent membrane attack complex formation in the absence of alternative pathway activity (55, 56) , WNV antigen presentation may be reduced in the absence of fB because of a failure to amplify classical and/or lectin pathway-initiated responses. This may attenuate C3bdirected targeting, uptake, and presentation of WNV in lymphoid tissues (2, 4, 27) . Alternatively, C3b engagement of CR3 may promote an appropriate cytokine environment for antiviral T cell priming: production of IFN\u03b3 and IL-12 were reduced by treatment of human monocytes with CR3 blocking antibodies or natural CR3 ligands (57) .",

            "text": "Our study expands the current knowledge of the in vivo mechanisms of complement-mediated antiviral immunity, and in particular suggests that activation of complement by distinct pathways may control pathogens by triggering diff erent eff ector arms of antiviral immunity. A limitation of our study is that it does not address the precise mechanism by which the three complement activation pathways stimulate diff erent adaptive immune responses; the diff erences could be because of quantitative or qualitative variation in the generation of C3 or C5 activation fragments. Regardless, a fully functional complement cascade is clearly important for controlling and clearing WNV given that antibody and CD8 + T cells both are essential for protection (14, 16, 17) . It is intriguing to consider that severe WNV infection in humans, which occurs infrequently \u202b,)051/1\u0641(\u202c could be more common in patients with dysfunctional complement responses. Although complete defi ciencies of complement proteins are rare, heterozygous defi ciencies of C4 and MBL are common (59) and have been associated with an increased risk of viral diseases (30, 49, 51, 60) . As therapies against WNV become available, it will be important to target high-risk populations. Depressed levels of complement proteins or reduced complement activity could explain why some seemingly healthy patients develop severe disease after WNV infection. Genetic studies that evaluate the risk factors of neuroinvasive WNV infection in humans should include an analysis of common complement gene allelic polymorphisms.",

Complement-defi cient and wild-type mice were anaesthetized and perfused with 20 ml of PBS on day 9 after infection with 10 2 PFU of WNV. Individual brains were harvested into RPMI supplemented with 5% FBS and homogenized by pressing through a 70-\u03bcm mesh tissue strainer (BD Biosciences). The cell homogenates were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI with 5% FBS and overlaid on a 70-30% isotonic percoll (Pharmacia) step gradient. The gradients were centrifuged (800 g for 25 min at 25\u00b0C), and the leukocytes were collected from between the 70 and 30% interface. Leukocytes from three brains were pooled, washed twice, and stained for CD4 + or CD8 + T cells with anti-CD3 (17A2) and anti-CD8\u03b1 (Ly-2) or anti-CD4 (L3T4) antibodies (BD PharMingen) in the presence of 5% goat serum after Fc block (2.4G2; BD PharMingen). After washing, cells were fi xed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS and analyzed by FACscan (Becton Dickinson) with CellQuest software. The total numbers of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells from each brain were determined by multiplying the percentage of CD3 + CD4 + or CD3 + CD8 + cells by the total numbers of leukocytes harvested.",
