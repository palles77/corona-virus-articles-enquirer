Understanding the psychological impact of the outbreak on healthcare workers, especially those in hospitals, is important in planning for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. This review draws upon qualitative and quantitative studies of the SARS outbreak in Toronto to outline the factors that contributed to healthcare workers' experiencing the outbreak as a psychological trauma. Overall, it is estimated that a high degree of distress was experienced by 29-35% of hospital workers. Three categories of contributory factors were identified. Relevant contextual factors were being a nurse, having contact with SARS patients and having children. Contributing attitudinal factors and processes were experiencing job stress, perceiving stigmatization, coping by avoiding crowds and colleagues, and feeling scrutinized. Pre-existing trait factors also contributed to vulnerability. Lessons learned from the outbreak include: (i) that effort is required to mitigate the psychological impact of infection control procedures, especially the interpersonal isolation that these procedures promote; (ii) that effective risk communication is a priority early in an outbreak; (iii) that healthcare workers may have a role in influencing patterns of media coverage that increase or decrease morale; (iv) that healthcare workers benefit from resources that facilitate reflection on the effects of extraordinary stressors; and (v) that healthcare workers benefit from practical interventions that demonstrate tangible support from institutions.",

The rapidity of its worldwide spread was the result of modern patterns of air travel. The equally impressive rapidity of the identification and genetic characterization of the coronavirus that caused the infection was the result of an unusually high degree of global scientific cooperation. The outbreak was also unusual among infectious diseases for the high rate of infection among healthcare workers, especially those working in hospitals. The infectiousness of SARS was substantially higher in hospital settings prior to an accurate identification of the syndrome and the institution of isolation precautions (mean number of secondary cases transmitted from each case, R 0 = 4) (World Health Organization 2003) than it was in hospitals after isolation precautions were in place (R 0 \u03fd 1) (Low & McGeer 2003) or in the community (R 0 \u03fd 1) (Low 2004) .",

It was known from a study of an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci within a hospital that nurses could be substantially burdened, and that factors contributing to the burden included feeling inadequately supported, blamed for the outbreak, and resentful of the increased workload (Mitchell et al. 2002) . Beyond those clues, efforts to deal with the psychological stress of healthcare workers in SARS-affected hospitals were, of necessity, guided by general principals of stress response and adaptation, availability of local resources, and flexible responsiveness to emerging patterns of psychological resilience and vulnerability. The severity of the psychological burden that SARS would place on healthcare workers was not clear at the onset of the outbreak, nor was there an existing model to guide the interventions that would be most successful in facilitating adaptation.",

Because so little is known about the psychological impact of large-scale infectious threats within hospitals and the psychological impact of the measures that are required to contain infection, it is the purpose of this paper to review the observations that have been made of the psychological impact of SARS on healthcare workers, both anecdotally and quantitatively, to draw lessons from this experience that may be valuable in support of hospital staff in the future as new infectious diseases emerge.",

For the Toronto survey it was modified to accurately describe our job designations. The survey included 76 survey items probing attitudes towards SARS, infection control procedures, perceived risk and coping. Attitude statements were scored on a six-point scale from (1) strongly disagree to (6) strongly agree. Because the outbreak was unprecedented and because the information required was specific to the outbreak, there was no opportunity to validate the SARS survey against other measures of coping and perceived risk. The survey therefore has only face validity. Surveys were not included in the analysis if more than 15 attitudinal items were missing or if any IES items were missing.",

Responses are never (scored 0), rarely (scored 1), sometimes (scored 3) and often (scored 5) regarding the one-week period preceding the survey (Horowitz et al. 1979; Sundin & Horowitz 2003) .

Handshaking, as an example of the type of routine physical contact that colleagues are likely to share, was not allowed. Early in the outbreak, the cafeteria was closed. Later, healthcare workers were allowed to eat in the cafeteria area but were instructed to space themselves apart by a distance of a few feet.

A list of questions regarding recent symptoms and recent contacts was asked by screening personnel at the door and then the staff member's temperature was taken. Symptoms probed included non-specific symptoms such as headache and feeling unwell. This process, although very useful for case detection, may also have contributed to anxious hypervigilance of one's own symptoms for the rest of the day.

Uncertainty and fear were the intertwined forces that propelled a substantial stress response in many people, particularly healthcare workers. While uncertainty and fear are probably inherent in the early stages of any large-scale stressor, what may be more peculiar to the stressful impact of an emerging infectious disease is the interpersonal isolation that results from the nature of the threat itself (i.e. stigma and avoidance of contact) and from the nature of our efforts to contain the threat (i.e. isolation precautions).",

Social support is known to be one of the most effective buffers against the adverse effects of life stress (Callaghan & Morrisey 1993; Uchino et al. 1996) and so the isolating effects of SARS may have been its most potently provocative feature. These isolation-provoking factors include the experience of social stigma, which separated healthcare workers from members of their community with whom they might otherwise have engaged constructively. Second, choosing to avoid others in crowds or choosing to avoid colleagues appears to have contributed to stress, even though such avoidance was recommended as a public health precaution. Avoidance as a form of coping may be less effective than other more active forms of problem solving, in spite of the infectiousness of SARS that made avoidance a rational strategy. More subtly, interpersonal contact was diminished by the necessity of using personal protective equipment, especially masks, which greatly reduced the ability to communicate with the nuances of non-verbal expression, and even interfered with healthcare workers recognizing one another. Finally, insecure attachment also limits the extent to which a person can benefit from the support that is available from loved ones ). Thus, one of the factors that makes SARS unique among recent large-scale stressors was the constellation of factors that each contributed to a sense of isolation among healthcare workers. Importantly, these are features that are likely to be shared by other emerging infections that are dealt with in hospitals.",

A third possibility is that this difference relates to differences in the intensity of contact with patients, such as the total duration of time spent with patients, which was not measured in the survey. Finally, disciplines may differ in the degree to which they experience the impact of various mediating factors.

These comparisons require attention to the time elapsed between the stressor and measurement of IES. More time passing before measurement of impact usually results in lower comparative mean levels.

These questions cannot be answered by the empirical evidence currently available.

Studies of other traumatic stressors suggest that symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder occurring immediately after a stressful event resolve in 6% of persons within a few weeks, in 53% after three months and in 58% after nine months (Shalev et al. 1998 ), but clearly, more research into the long-term effects of SARS is required.",

There are several more-or-less independent decisions that need to be made in an outbreak regarding infection control procedures. How extensively is quarantine used? How widespread is the requirement for masks and other protective equipment? How restrictive do limits on social contact between professionals need to be? How restricted does access to the hospital need to be? These various procedures may affect psychological stress differently. Furthermore, some may be more effective than others in controlling infectious spread. The data presented here suggest that close scrutiny of the cost-benefit ratio of each step may be useful. However, our study provides no information that would allow one to compare the magnitudes of the costs and benefits of isolation procedures.

Some workers reported that they changed their clothes in the garage at night rather than taking the risk that a SARS virus living on the fabric might come in contact with a family member. One approach to remedy this disagreement would be an intensive effort to educate nurses about the limited benefits of greens, but that approach would risk further alienating a vitally important group of healthcare workers. Instead, recognizing that the psychological impact of perceived support is important, a negotiation took place in which the nurses devised a system of signing out greens to prevent theft, and the hospital ensured an adequate supply.

This work, of course, leaves many questions. We do not know whether stress symptoms related to SARS persist in our hospital workers or whether the acute stress has largely returned to normal. We have a measure of traumatic stress symptoms but we do not know the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder related to SARS. Leaving aside psychiatric diagnosis, we do not know the degree to which SARS has contributed to professional burnout. Perhaps most importantly for the system as a whole, we do not know what the effect of the SARS outbreak has been on the ability of hospitals and professional schools to recruit new staff, to retain the staff that they have, and to train professionals to work in emergency medicine and intensive care. Finally, although healthcare in Toronto was greatly changed for several weeks during the SARS outbreak, we do not yet know the different effects that may have occurred in regions such as China where the impact of infection, death and extensive infection control procedures was much greater.",
