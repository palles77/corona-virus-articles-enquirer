            "text": "Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of antimicrobial use and mortality in young calves. To reduce antimicrobial use and resistance on dairy farms, research on alternative therapies for calf diarrhea is necessary. Our laboratory previously conducted a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein found in colostrum, as a treatment for calf diarrhea. The trial showed significantly reduced calf mortality in diarrheic calves that were administered lactoferrin. Thus, the objective of this study was to corroborate the results of our prior clinical trial across multiple farms and to investigate the effect of lactoferrin on the morbidity and mortality of preweaned calves with naturally occurring cases of diarrhea. This randomized field trial was conducted on 5 commercial dairy farms in Ohio. In total, 485 calves (\u226421 d of age) were enrolled at first diarrhea diagnosis (fecal score \u22652 defined as loose to watery) and randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of lactoferrin (3 g of lactoferrin powder dissolved in 30 mL of water) or 30 mL of water (control) once daily for 3 consecutive days. Health assessments were conducted on the day of diarrhea diagnosis (d 0) and 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d following diagnosis. Producer records of disease treatment and mortality were collected 120 d following diagnosis. A Poisson regression model was used to test differences between treatments in disease frequency through 35 d post-diarrhea diagnosis and the incidence risk of treatment and mortality risk 120 d post-diarrhea diagnosis; the model controlled for calf age at enrollment, farm, and treatment. Median calf age at enrollment was 11 d and ranged from 1 to 26 d of age. At study enrollment, 51.3% (123/240) and 52.2% (128/245) of calves in the control and lactoferrin treatment groups, respectively, were diagnosed with severe diarrhea (fecal score = 3). The frequency of disease (diarrhea, dehydration, depression, signs of respiratory disease) through 35 d following diarrhea diagnosis was not significantly different for calves in the lactoferrin and control groups. Overall mortality risk for enrolled calves was 9.9%, and 10.7% (22/243) and 9.1% (26/242) of calves in the lactoferrin and control groups, respectively, died or were culled in the 120 d following diarrhea diagnosis. The relative risk of death or culling did not differ between treatment groups, however. Therefore, as performed in this study, lactoferrin as a treatment for calf diarrhea was not beneficial.",

Antimicrobials used for treatment in dairy calves have an important public health impact, and those categorized as \"highest priority critically important\" by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2017) , including third-generation cephalosporins, are commonly used to treat calf diarrhea in the United States (Constable, 2004; Pereira et al., 2014; USDA, 2018) .

Means, proportions, and standard errors were calculated for baseline characteristics at enrollment. Potential baseline differences between treatment groups were tested using model-based approaches that accounted for nonindependence of calves within farms. A linear regression model (PROC GLM, SAS version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to test for differences in continuous variables (temperature, packed cell volume, and total serum protein) at enrollment. A logistic regression model (PROC GLIMMIX, SAS version 9.4) was used to test for differences in age and dichotomized fecal, dehydration, and depression scores between treatment groups at enrollment. A Poisson regression model (PROC GENMOD, SAS version 9.4) with robust standard errors (Zou, 2004) was used to identify differences in the rate (across 6 observation days) of diagnosed diarrhea, depression, dehydration, and signs of respiratory disease (cough or ocular discharge and ear droop) post-diarrhea treatment. Very few cases of complicated diarrhea or signs of nasal discharge were diagnosed posttreatment; thus, these variables were excluded from further analyses. The experimental unit and the unit of observation were the calf, and the outcome for the model was the count of observed days with disease divided by a total of 6 calf-days at risk. Because health assessments were performed on 6 occasions post-diarrhea treatment (d 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35), each calf contributed a maximum of 6 calf-days. Due to study limitations, fewer calves had d 3 (control: n = 149; lactoferrin: n = 168 calves with completed observations) and d 35 (control: n = 168; lactoferrin: n = 169 calves with completed observations) follow-up health assessments. Baseline (day of enrollment) health assessment variables, including packed cell volume, total serum protein, age, dehydration, depression, and signs of respiratory disease, were retained in the model if the univariable P-value was <0.20 or if inclusion of the variable changed the treatment effect (risk ratio) measure by >20%. Despite robust randomization procedures, calf age at enrollment differed between treatment groups and farm and was thus included in the model to account for variation in age at enrollment. The final model included treatment, farm, and calf age at enrollment. Rate ratios for diarrhea, depression, dehydration, and signs of respiratory disease and the associated 95% confidence intervals were derived from the model using the \"estimate\" statement.",

Inclusion of multiple farms also reduces the risk of potential selection bias and confounding variables that may be associated with one farm. Additional strengths of this study include robust randomization and blinding procedures. One potential pitfall of this study, and a common limitation of randomized clinical trials, is missing data from a subset of calves during follow-up evaluations.

Previous studies have reported that lactoferrin improved fecal consistency in calves when supplemented 1 g/d from 3 d of age to 2 wk postweaning (Robblee et al., 2003) . Prenner et al. (2007) also reported fewer diseased days and reduced severity of diarrhea cases in calves supplemented with lactoferrin at 0.16% from birth to 70 d of age.

            "text": "Lactoferrin treatment tended to reduce the risk of diarrhea 14 d following diagnosis. This result was unexpected. It is possible that lactoferrin may have a pro- tective effect against certain pathogens, such as bovine rotavirus or coronavirus, which usually causes diarrhea in calves 1 to 2 wk of age (Cho and Yoon, 2014) . Although we accounted for as many variables as possible that may have influenced our outcomes, it is also quite possible that this is merely a spurious relationship. Furthermore, we observed no difference between treatments in the frequency of clinical signs associated with respiratory disease, such as ocular discharge or ear droop or cough. We hypothesized that the observed reduction in mortality and culling for calves treated with lactoferrin in our former trial may have been due to reduced severity or frequency of respiratory disease, yet the results of our current study do not support this idea. To our knowledge, very little research has been conducted to determine the influence of lactoferrin on respiratory disease in young dairy calves. However, a recent study reported a reduction in the incidence rate of respiratory-and diarrheal-related illnesses in human infants supplemented with lactoferrin-fortified formula for 3 mo (Chen et al., 2016) . Additionally, a pilot study by King et al. (2007) reported significantly fewer lower respiratory tract infections in infants when supplemented with lactoferrin for 12 mo; however, further studies are needed to corroborate these results. Thus, it is possible that lactoferrin may have beneficial effects on calf morbidity if supplemented throughout and beyond the preweaning period, but in contrast to our prior findings, the results of this study suggest little to no long-term effect on health when used as a 3-d treatment for early cases of calf diarrhea.",

In the current study, experimental treatments (lactoferrin and control) were administered as an adjunct to antimicrobial therapies, per farm treatment protocols. In other words, the farms enrolled in this study did not alter their disease treatment protocols, and farms continued to treat cases of diarrhea and other diseases independent of research staff diagnosis. Thus, it is possible that the antimicrobial therapies administered by farm personnel masked the potential beneficial effect of lactoferrin on calf morbidity and mortality. It is also possible that we did not have the statistical power to detect a significant difference with the mortality estimates used for the power analysis calculations, as the case-mortality rate was lower than expected.
