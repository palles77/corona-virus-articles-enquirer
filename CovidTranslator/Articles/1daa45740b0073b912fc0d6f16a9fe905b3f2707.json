            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes a severe clinical enteric disease in suckling neonates with up to 100% mortality, resulting in devastating economic losses to the pork industry in recent years. Maternal immunity via colostrum and milk is a vital source to neonates of passive protection against diarrhea, dehydration and death caused by PEDV. Comprehensive information on neutralizing activity (NA) against PEDV in mammary secretions is critically important for assessing the protective capacity of sows. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize anti-PEDV neutralizing activity in mammary secretions. Anti-PEDV NA was present in colostrum, milk and serum from PEDV-infected sows as determined both by immunofluorescence and ELISA-based neutralizing assays, with neutralization levels higher in colostrum and milk than in serum. The highest NA was observed in colostrum on day 1, and decreased rapidly in milk at day 3, then gradually declined from day 3 to day 19 post-farrowing. Notably, the NA in mammary secretions showed various patterns of decline over time of lactation that may contribute to variation in sow protective capacities. The kinetics of NA decline were associated with total IgA and IgG antibody levels. Neutralizing activity significantly correlated with specific IgA primarily to spike domain 1 (S1) and domain 2 (S2) proteins of PEDV rather than to specific IgG in colostrum. Subsequently, the NA in milk was mainly related to specific IgA to S1 and S2 during lactation.",

The use of 50% reduction as the readout in place of a focus-forming or plaque assay with 90% reduction enables optimization of key parameters, including MOI and testing of the percentage law (Andrewes and Elford, 1933; Brioen and Boeye, 1985) . The 50% endpoint for neutralization titers was used in place of 90% reduction in focus-forming units to gain information about the antibody reactivity independently of antigen concentration. Virus-antibody interactions can be modeled as antigen-antibody interactions that conform to the law of mass action as a reaction approaches equilibrium (Klasse and Sattentau, 2002; Reverberi and Reverberi, 2007; Tyrrell, 1953) . Since neutralized and nonneutralized virus is in equilibrium at 50% inhibition of infectivity, mathematical modeling can be used to assess functional qualities of antibodies and antisera that have viral neutralizing activity, as has been shown in HIV, influenza virus, human adenovirus, equine infectious anemia virus, chimeric SIV/HIV, and Newcastle disease virus infections (Klasse and Moore, 1996; McEwan et al., 2012; Nishimura et al., 2002; Schwartz and Smith, 2014; Shingai et al., 2014; To et al., 2012; Tyrrell, 1953; Willey et al., 2010) . Characterization of neutralization affinity, reaction kinetics, and avidity cannot be determined under more stringent conditions, such as at 90% inhibition, which are not at equilibrium. More stringent neutralization readouts may have value for diagnostic purposes or for studies in which there is background cross-reactivity such as with dengue virus (Roehrig et al., 2008) . However, cross-reacting substances have not been reported to interfere with PEDV neutralization assays. Table 2 Correlations between neutralizing activities and isotype-specific antibodies to N, S1 and S2 proteins in colostrum and milk a . *or ** indicated that the correlation was significant at the 0.05 or 0.01 level (2-tailed). a Colostrum (day 1) and milk (days 1, 3, 12 and 19 post-farrowing) were collected from PEDV immune sows. Correlation was performed by comparing the neutralizing titer of each sample to the antigen-and isotype-specfiic ELISA value of the sample using SPSS 17.0. In summary, the data show that neutralizing antibody levels against PEDV are high but patterns of passive expression in colostrum and milk are variable over time in mammary secretions. Sow variability might help explain the inconsistent success of feedback methods to protect suckling neonates from clinical PED through maternal protection received from immune dams. Moreover, the kinetics of neutralizing antibody titers during lactation help explain the pivotal role of IgA in colostrum and milk in suckling neonates to gain passive protection. The amount of neutralizing antibodies necessary for protection in piglets is unknown, and would be affected by titer, volume of milk ingested, antibody stability in the enteric environment, and possibly other variables that could be difficult to measure. Neutralizing activities in mammary secretions, which can be assessed and are mainly correlated with specific IgA antibodies to PEDV spike glycoprotein, may help guide vaccine design and immunological monitoring for PEDV.",
