A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID=8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials.

Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID=48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID=6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer. These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread.",

Also, in previous studies, membrane or matrix proteins of various viruses were analysed with respect to their intrinsic disorder content and roles in protecting the respective virions.

We believe that this is not the case. If SARS-CoV-2 would be placed in category C, the same category as MERS-CoV, then the model would be definitely wrong in terms of reproducibility. On the other hand, the placing of SARS-COV-2 in category A would be an inconsistency that would be difficult to explain. One would further notice that very few CoVs fall into category A, with the exception for HCoV-229E and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which make the chance of any CoVs including SARS-COV-2, to be in category A slim. More importantly, because SARS-CoV-2 is zoonotic and the only non-human CoV in category A is the avian IBV, placing SARS-COV-2 in category A could suggest that this virus is likely to be of avian origin, which is inconsistent with what we know about SARS-CoV-2. Phylogenetic study has confirmed that the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 are bat CoVs 4, 36 . We also noticed that at least three of closest neighbors with similar N PIDs of 47-48% are those of bat origin (See Table 1 ). This suggests that bat CoVs are likely to have an optimal mix of fecal-oral and respiratory transmission potentials that reflect their N PID range of 47-48%, which provides for greater fitness for the spread of the viruses among bats and that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be of bat origin too given its N PID is 48%. There are highly debatable suggestions that snakes or pangolins 3,37,38 may be an intermediary host of the virus. Even if any of these is later deemed as true, our data imply that the virus had not the chance to evolved much with any intermediary host except bats, unlike the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in which the model does suggest that they had evolved with hosts such as civet cats and camels respectively. This suggestion is, however, based on N PID alone.",

Furthermore, a strong but oddly weaker correlation ( r 2 = 0.77, p< 0.001) can also be found when N PID is the sole independent variable even if poor correlation ( r 2 = 0.21) is found when M PID is the sole independent variable. This basically means that the model should include both M and N PIDs as the statistical model seems to suggest that M PID does contribute, even if slightly, to the mode of transmission in conjunction to the major contribution by N PID. .This is consistent with the idea that both M and N play roles in protecting the virion from environmental damage and the need to protect the virion is dependent on mode of transmission. A qualitative inspection of the viruses in the three groups also reveals consistency. For example, as in Table 1 , canine CoV-respiratory falls into category B, while canine CoV-enteritis is in category C. The porcine CoVs are also consistent with observation of their behaviors as we will later see.",

This ability provides for rapid replication of the viral viral proteins and particles. This quick replication is also an efficient way to evade the host immune system by reproducing a large number of viral particles before the immune system even recognizes the virus,, which then often goes on to overwhelm the body leading to the death of the host 6,23-26 . One highly plausible explanation for the link between rapid replication and the modes of transmission is that viral load in the body fluids of the infected host needs to be sufficiently high before the virus can be infectious via the respiratory mode. This therefore explains the fact that rapid viral replication and inner shell disorder were found to be the common link between virulence and respiratory transmission in the case of Nipah virus 26 .",

We need to understand that the respiratory transmission potential of a single viral particle is just one of several factors that might contribute to the contagiousness of the virus. Other factors include how many particles are released by the host and how long does the particle remain in the environment. We mentioned that our model has detected something odd about SARS-COV-2: this virus has one of the hardest outer shell within the family as seen in Figure 1 and Table 1 (M PID = 6 %). Since the outer shell plays the greater role in protecting the virion in comparison to the inner shell, the harder outer shell provides virus greater resilience to outside the body environment and to the presence of digestive enzymes found in the saliva, mucus, and other bodily fluids 20,22,42-46 . As a result, the virus with the harder outer shell is able to remain active for a longer time and, therefore a lesser number of viral particles is required for a chance to infect someone. Furthermore, because the virus is more resistant to the digestive enzymes in the bodily fluids, an infected body is likely to discharged more infectious particles.",

This is especially so in the case of TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus).

Our analysis reveals that TGEV is of category C (higher fecal-oral, lower respiratory transmission potentials) with M and N PIDs at 14% and 43% respectively. The reason that it is able to move rapidly is that its high fecal-oral transmission potential represents a more efficient mode of transmission among the farm animals.",

Apparently, the result is implying that this is not necessarily true, as we have seen, and having higher fecal-oral transmission potential can actually provide greater efficiency in the spread among farm animals, as we have seen in TGEV, such that the virus does not have to stay long outside the body. The ability to stay longer in the environment could, however, provide advantages to a virus with greater respiratory transmission potential, especially with respect to spread via airborne virus from feces or body fluids.

This virus and its disease are currently known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) respectively 1-4 . SARS-CoV-2 is observed to be even more contagious (but fortunately less fatal) than SARS-CoV that was seen in 2003.In 2011-2012, just before the outbreak of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), we built an empirically-based model that measures the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins in viruses 5,6 . The main tool uses AI technology to recognize intrinsic disorder, given the protein sequence. The model involves the listing of shell disorder by coronaviruses that is easily clustered into three groups, which incidentally correlate with the known levels of fecal-oral and respiratory transmission of the various coronaviruses. The model predicts that the 2003 SARS-CoV (M PID = 8% and N PID =50%) is included into a category of CoVs with intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. An opportunity to test the validity of this model came when MERS-CoV first struck the Middle East in 2012. Upon the availability of the sequences of both MERS-CoV M and N proteins, the authors were able to confirm that MERS-CoV falls solidly into a category of viruses that have lesser respiratory transmission potential but have greater fecal-oral transmission capabilitie 6,7 . The categorization of MERS-CoV within this category was supported by the observations that MERS-",

M PID is therefore a more crucial indicator of the \"hardness\" of the virion. However, because of the higher correlation of N to the mode of transmission, our model is apparently suggesting that some other mechanisms are involved. In fact, studies of inner shell of other viruses such as Nipah virus, Ebola virus and flaviviruses 23-26 have indicated strong correlations between inner shell disorder and virulence. In the case of Nipah virus, the virulence and inner shell disorder were linked to the modes of transmission 26",

The N protein also helps with the packaging and budding of viral particles in the host ER (Endoplasmic Reticulum) 23,30,40 .

This peculiarity is likely responsible for its high level of contagiousness, since hardness of its outer shell could provide the virus with the greater resilience to the conditions outside the body and in body fluid, as the harder shell will better protect the virion from damage as a result of the hostile environment and action of the digestive enzymes found in bodily fluids. As a result, it is likely that the infected body can shed more infectious particles that have a greater chance of infecting a person over its lifetime. Chances of infections via indirect contact and airborne virus from feces and bodily fluids are therefore greater.
