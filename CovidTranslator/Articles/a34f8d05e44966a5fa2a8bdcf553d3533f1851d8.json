(a) Coarse-grained distribution of element values ln(1 \u2212 \u03bb i )a ij times \u22121 in the reconstructed vector X of all nodes in a Newman-Watts small-world network (NW), where bin accumulation is implemented for the original distribution. The peak centered at zero corresponds to null connections and the other corresponds to actual links. A cut-off value can be set within the gap between the two peaks. (b) The values of ln(1 \u2212 \u03bb i )a ij times -1 in the reconstructed vector X for Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random networks (ER), Watts-Strogatz small-world networks (WS), NW and Barab\u00e1si-Albert scale-free networks (BA), where green and yellow points correspond to existent links and null connections, respectively. All the networks share the same cut-off value of about 0.13. (c) Coarse-grained distribution of the structural variance \u03c3 in the NW network, where bin accumulation is exercised on the original distribution. The largest peak centered close zero corresponds to nodes of indirect neighbors of the hidden source and the large positive values of \u03c3 are associated with the immediate neighbors of the hidden source. A cut-off can be set within the largest gap. (d) The variance \u03c3 * i of element values in the reconstructed vector x of all nodes in the presence of a hidden source for ER, WS, NW and BA networks, where green and yellow points correspond to immediate neighbors and indirect neighbors of the hidden source, respectively. All the networks share the same cut-off values of about \u03c3 * i = 0.9. The network size in a,b is 200 and in c,d is 50, \u0398 = 0.25, \u2206 = 0.45, \u03bb i and \u03b4 i are uniformly distributed in the ranges (0.2, 0.4) and (0.4, 0.6), respectively. SIS dynamics are used for the illustration. Panels a and c correspond to Fig. 2a with nt = 0.4 and Fig. 5 in the main text, respectively.",

Prior works have verified that RIP holds with high probability for sampling matrices \u03a6 whose entries are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) realizations of certain random variables, provided that the number of rows in the matrix is large enough. For our reconstruction problem, the randomness of matrix \u03a6 is induced by the stochastic effect in the spreading process, allowing us to successfully reconstruct the neighboring vector X from a small number of base strings using compressed sensing algorithm. The accurate reconstruction results obtained from a variety of complex networks suggest that the condition of RIP is met, due to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the spreading dynamics. With respect to data requirement, our experience suggests that the main factor determining the amount of data required is the sparsity of vector X, where a sparser vector X requires less data for reconstruction. Nevertheless, provided with sufficient data, one can recover even relatively dense vectors.",

It is noteworthy that different base strings may share some strings in their contribution to the two average quantities in the sense that a string according to the threshold \u2206 may be subject to more than one base string. This will not have any negative impact on full reconstruction. More importantly, the sharing of strings by different base strings considerably reduces the minimum requirement of the length of time series and makes all available data sufficiently used, accounting for the slow increase of the minimum length t min of time series with the network size, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 .",

This can be done when there is an explicit gap between the values of the reconstructed elements associated with existent links and those with null links so that a cut-off can be set in the gap. The elements with values larger than the cut-off value are regarded as corresponding to actual links, while those with values smaller than the cut-off value correspond to zeros in the adjacency matrix. However, ambiguity may arise due to the dispersion in the element values. It is thus necessary to determine the cut-off value reliably. In the ideal situation, the element values in X exhibit a bimodal type of distribution, with one peak (centered at some positive value) corresponding to actual links and another (centered about zero) to null connections. However, due to the fluctuations in the distribution, the two peaks may overlap, making it difficult to set a cut-off. Our idea is to use coarsegraining to suppress noise but preserve the useful information. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1(a) , we calculate the local accumulation of the element values in the entire distribution region. The size of each bin can be adjusted according to the width of the peak centered at zero, with the constraint that the bin size should not be larger than the width of this peak. Empirically, 5 to 10 bins are effective to reduce noise while retaining the information about the link structure. Implementing such a coarse-grained process can in general make the \"valley\" between the two peaks distinct. The coarse-graining works even when there was no clear gap between the two peaks. In this case, we choose the lowest point in the valley between the two peaks to be the cut-off value.",

The \u03c3 i values can thus be used to reliably identify the neighboring nodes of the hidden source. Similar to the task of distinguishing actual links from null connections, we generate the statistical distribution of \u03c3 i and identify those nodes with abnormally large \u03c3 i values, which can be accomplished by using the coarse-grained method, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1c . After accumulating the bins, a well-defined gap between the small and rare large values of \u03c3 i emerges. A cut-off can then be set within the largest gap, where the nodes associated with the large \u03c3 i values are identified as the immediate neighbors of the hidden source.

Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3 show the success rates of reconstructing a number of model and real networks as a function of the fraction nt of base strings. For all networks studied, high recovery accuracy in a wide range of the values of nt is achieved. However, for nt close to unity, there is a slight decrease in the success rates. This can be attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of the compressed-sensing algorithm. Recall that compressed sensing is developed for solving under-determined systems with many more unknowns than the number of equations [12] . In order to assure a unique solution of the under-determined system, the constraint of sparsity must be imposed. Mathematically, if under such a constraint a unique solution indeed exists, the compressed-sensing framework enables recovery of the solution. For nt = 1, the matrix \u03a6 becomes a square matrix, indicating that the system is no longer under-determined. Although the compressedsensing algorithm is not restricted to under-determined systems, our results demonstrate that it performs better for under-determined systems than for nt = 1, as reflected by the decrease in the success rates when nt approaches to unity. However, since our method would typically be applied with limited data, the reconstruction accuracy can be still assured by using nt < 1 (so that nt = 1 is naturally avoided) in the process of setting up the compressed-sensing equation Y = \u03a6 \u00b7 X.",

This can be explained by the fact that different base strings may share some common strings in the reconstruction. The relative minimum length n min t resulting from t min /N is shown in Figs. 3(c,d) in the main text. One can see that n min t is considerably reduced as N is increased.

In this case, it is difficult to ascertain which neighbor passes the disease to the node. For example, in the extreme case where a node remains infected all the time, it is practically impossible to determine from which of its neighbors the infection comes.

However, for larger values of the average degree, scale-free networks perform better than the other two types of networks. This can be understood, as follows. In a scale-free network, the heterogeneous degree distribution indicates that most nodes have small degrees. In contrast, in the ER and NW networks, the degree distributions are approximately homogeneous. Thus, for the same value of \u27e8k\u27e9, the degrees of most nodes in scale-free networks are less than those in the ER and NW networks, resulting in slightly larger success rates when reconstructing scale-free networks. In fact, in the presence of high-degree nodes, we can provide a heuristic method to improve the success rates by taking advantage of the \"conflicts\" arising when matching the neighborhoods of different nodes, since the neighborhood of each node is recovered independently of others. The errors in the reconstruction of the whole network will induce certain inconsistency in predicting the presence/absence of links among nodes. Due to the relatively large reconstruction errors associated with higher-degree nodes, it is reasonable to accept the predicted links centered at smaller-degree nodes rather than that centered at high-degree nodes whenever such a conflict arises. This way the errors associated with high-degree nodes can be considerably reduced. This method can further improve the reconstruction accuracy of scale-free networks or in any networks where a small set of high-degree nodes exist.",

This phenomenon suggests that missing time series only affect the width of the gap, but otherwise has little influence on the reconstruction.

In contrast, the effect of unobservable nodes is relatively minor as compared to that of the hidden source, so their connections to the other observable nodes are difficult to be inferred.

In this case, ideally the standard SIS and CP dynamics are no longer applicable.

Moreover, even if the fitted line deviates from the diagonal line, the linear correlation can still assure the success of reconstruction based on equation (15) in the main text. The difference between the slope of the fitted lines and unity will become a small coefficient added to the neighboring vector X, which will slightly affect the element values in X, affecting only the width of the gap between actual links and null connections, but not the cut-off and identification of links.",

Each threshold value is bounded in the unit interval, as stipulated by the definition of the normalized Hamming distance. Specifically, \u2206 is employed to approximate the law of large numbers because of the difficulty to find two strings with absolute zero normalized Hamming distance.

If and only if both SREL and SRNC approach unity, the network is regarded as having been exactly reconstructed. In Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12, the smaller value of SREL and SRNC is defined to be the success rate.

Suppose that a string belongs to a base string in the sense that the normalized Hamming distance between them is less than the threshold \u2206. In the presence of noise, some states of nodes in the strings are reversed, resulting in the change of the normalized Hamming distance that may become larger than the threshold \u2206. However, due to the broad region of the applicable values of \u2206, the change of the normalized Hamming distance is tolerable and the string is likely to still belong to the base string and can be used to estimate the infection probability P 01 (t), so the selection of strings with respect to a base string based on the normalized Hamming distance is robust against noise. Analogously, identifying different base strings in terms of the threshold \u0398 is insensitive to noise due to the broad region of \u0398. The other factor by which noise may affect the reconstruction accuracy is the process of averaging over node states for obtaining \u27e8S i (t \u03b1 + 1)\u27e9 and \u27e8S i (t)\u27e9. Since the error in measuring node states induced by noise will be naturally reduced by the average, there is resistance to noise. In general, noise can be tolerated in all steps required to construct the vector Y and matrix \u03a6, ensuring robustness of our reconstruction framework against noise in time series.",
