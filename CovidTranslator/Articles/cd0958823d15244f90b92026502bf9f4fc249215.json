Its role in the nervous system is prominent but paradoxical. Studies on uninflamed or \"normal\" brain have generally attributed TNF-\u03b1 a neuromodulatory effect. In contrast, in inflamed or diseased brain, the abundance of evidence suggests that TNF-\u03b1 has an overall neurotoxic effect, which may be particularly pronounced for virally mediated neurological disease. Still others have found TNF-\u03b1 to be protective under some conditions of neurological insult. It is still uncertain exactly how TNF-\u03b1 is able to induce these opposing effects through receptor activation of only a limited set of cell signaling pathways. In this paper, we provide support from the literature to advance our hypothesis that one mechanism by which TNF-\u03b1 can exert its paradoxical effects in the brain is via crosstalk with signaling pathways of growth factors or other cytokines.

            "text": "Up-regulated in most if not all immune and inflammatory responses in the brain, TNF-\u03ba likely has important roles in a broad range of neurodegenerative disease. However, these roles are widely variable and often uncertain: in different settings, TNF-\u03ba can be causative, beneficial, or secondary to the disease. There are a multitude of factors that might determine whether TNF-\u03ba will have a protective or toxic effect on neurons under pathological brain conditions, and many of those will be discussed here. Which of the effects of TNF-\u03ba predominate may be in part dictated by the involvement of viral infection in the disease. TNF-\u03ba has been implicated in a number of definitive TNF-\u03b1 intraneuronal receptor crosstalk in normal and diseased brain 612 SW Perry et al Note. TNF-\u03ba or its receptors, as indicated in column 4, may play a role in the pathology of these viral infections of the nervous system. This is not an exhaustive list. Subfamily given for Herpesviridae. viral disease affecting the nervous system (Table 1) , and its role in some of these will be discussed in more detail later. In general, for some neurological diseases that result directly from known and active viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the nervous system, the neural effects of TNF-\u03ba are almost decidedly toxic. For neurodegenerative diseases not known to have a direct and active viral cause, the role of TNF-\u03ba is often more ambiguous, with different investigators reporting toxic, nontoxic, and even protective effects. There is also a growing list of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia, and multiple sclerosis (MS), that are not themselves defined by an active viral infection, but for which prior or latent viral infections may confer increased susceptibility to, or even induce, the disease. In AD (Itzhaki and Dobson, 2002; Perry et al, 2001; Verreault et al, 2001) , schizophrenia (Boin et al, 2001; Yolken et al, 2000) , and MS (see Hemmer et al, 2002 and Cermelli and Jacobson, 2000 , for review), TNF-\u03ba has been ascribed a possible role in either conferring susceptibility to the disease and/ or contributing to the pathophysiology of the disease itself. Although demonstrating a causative role is difficult, particularly in clinical studies, evidence that TNF-\u03ba plays a significant part in the disease is substantial and convincing. Evidence for the role of TNF-\u03ba in the development or progression of schizophrenia is still more equivocal, although the hypothesis has attracted considerable current research attention. Evidence for viral linksparticularly causative links as opposed to consequential links-to these diseases is also contested, but the burgeoning literature on the subject in recent years makes the possibility difficult to ignore.",

We propose that much as peripherally derived cytokines may determine the fate of a target immune cell, the complex balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS, along with other trophic factors, may determine a neuron's fate. Thus, CNS cytokines may serve as common mediators for a number of neuropathological conditions that were previously thought unrelated.

TNF-\u03ba derived from peripheral immune cells can act in a hormone-like fashion through the HPA axis and the vagus nerve to stimulate and affect several CNS responses, including neuroendocrine responses, sickness, and other behavioral patterns, as well as sleep and fever (Sternberg, 1997) . In turn, feedback from the HPA axis, the sympathetic nervous system, and the peripheral nervous system act to regulate the immune system. Brain vasculature can also convey cytokine-induced signals to the brain via second messengers, such as nitric oxide (NO) or prostanoids (Licinio and Wong, 1997) . Finally, peripherally derived TNF-\u03ba can enter the CNS and thus act directly on brain parenchyma by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), either by active transport mechanisms or passive diffusion in the circumventricular organs, including areas of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and pineal gland (Sternberg, 1997) . Although much of this action occurs in response to immune activation, there is growing evidence to suggest that peripheral TNF-\u03ba and other peripheral cytokines may exert neuromodulatory actions in healthy individuals under noninflammatory (i.e., immune \"normal\") conditions-for example, regulation of sleep and feeding (Vitkovic et al, 2000) .",

Several key observations argue for an important homeostatic role for TNF-\u03ba in normal brain: (1) TNF-\u03ba and its receptors are constitutively expressed in discrete brain regions in a manner consistent with a role in endogenous brain function; (2) expression is developmentally regulated; and (3) spatial and temporal variations in expression are consistent with a likely role in regulating sleep and other neuroendocrine and autonomic functions. The following studies will support the hypothesis that TNF-\u03ba is both present and functionally active at the levels found in uninflamed, healthy brain.",

In this fashion, TNF-\u03ba may be a common mediator or effector of the pathologies seen in many seemingly disparate neurological diseases. Furthermore, there has been sufficient evidence to suggest that (1) brain TNF\u03ba (and other cytokine) levels are acutely increased even with peripheral illnesses, or illnesses of any nature, and that this increased activity is what moderates fever and other sickness behavior (decreased appetite, somnolence, attention to illness, etc.) (Dantzer, 2001) ; and (2) in similar fashion, increased cytokine (including TNF-\u03ba ) expression may alter production, function, and/or turnover of a variety of neurotransmitters, and thus is likely to play a role in many behavioral and psychiatric illnesses (Kronfol and Remick, 2000) .

In many neurological diseases, the amount of peripheral TNF-\u03ba entering the brain increases relative to the normal state (Pan et al, 1997) . This might occur for several reasons. First, the local CNS immune response may recruit activated (i.e., TNF-\u03ba -producing) peripheral leukocytes and macrophages to the brain. Permeability of the BBB also increases with brain inflammation (Pan et al, 1997) , which may increase access of these peripheral immune cells to the brain parenchyma, as well as increase passage of peripheral TNF-\u03ba . Significantly, TNF-\u03ba itself may play a key role in increasing BBB permeability and recruiting activated immune cells (Pan et al, 1997) . This has been most well documented and determined to be of particular significance in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and HAD (Pan et al, 1997; Epstein and Gelbard, 1995) . Finally, any peripheral immune activation will increase the amount of peripheral TNF-\u03ba available to enter the brain by the active or passive transport mechanisms mentioned earlier. In illnesses that do not directly affect the nervous system, this phenomenon may simply serve to regulate sickness behavior. However, in illnesses with a direct neurological component, the association of other factors may make it such that this increased peripheral TNF-\u03ba actually contributes to the pathology of the neurological illness.",

Although no generalization can be made regarding the persistence of elevated TNF-\u03ba levels in the CNS during the course of neurodegenerative diseases, in some cases glia or neurons alone are likely to become the primary producers of TNF in the CNS (Munoz-Fernandez and Fresno, 1998) .",

Not surprisingly, then, TNF-\u03ba has been ascribed a significant role in the pathology of this disease (Griffin, 1997) . Perhaps the most telling evidence to implicate TNF-\u03ba in inflammatory damage to the CNS from virally mediated neurodegeneration comes from work using the LP-BM5 Moloney leukemia virus model for murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS). Despite being an (onco)retroviral infection, this model mimics many of the key immunological, biochemical, and neurological features of lentiviral infection in the CNS (Kustova et al, 1998) . Using LP-BM5-infected mice with a targeted deletion of TNF-\u03ba , Iida et al (2000) demonstrated that CNS neuropathology and biochemical and neurocognitive effects were substantially ameliorated despite unchanged systemic signs of immunodeficiency compared to wild-type mice infected with LP-BM5. As a variety of viral agents likely cause similar dramatic increases in CNS TNF-\u03ba levels via the mechanisms described above, TNF-\u03ba or its receptors are also implicated in the pathogenesis of other virally induced neurodegenerative diseases that target the brain and/or spinal cord. Many of these are listed in Table 1 .",

In AD, elevated levels of TNF-\u03ba are expressed by microglia associated with amyloid plaques, and beta-amyloid has been shown to stimulate neurotoxic levels of TNF-\u03ba from microglia, suggesting a possible role for TNF-\u03ba in AD pathogenesis (Munoz-Fernandez and Fresno, 1998) . Similarly, TNF-\u03ba immunoreactive glial cells have been observed in close proximity to degenerating dopaminergic neurons in PD, and thus TNF-\u03ba may also contribute to PD pathogenesis by inducing death of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons via a ceramide-dependent pathway (Brugg et al, 1996) . In MS, or the related animal model EAE, levels of TNF-\u03ba may correlate with disease progression, and blocking TNF-\u03ba ameliorates disease severity (Munoz-Fernandez and Fresno, 1998) . One mechanism by which TNF-\u03ba is thought to be neurodestructive in MS is by inducing damage to oligodendrocytes (Munoz-Fernandez and Fresno, 1998) , although other more direct effects on neurons may also exist. In stroke (ischemia), TBI, and intracerebral hemorrhage, TNF-\u03ba production is up-regulated after injury, and is directly correlated with extent of cerebral damage and neurological impairment (Mayne et al, 2001; Knoblach et al, 1999; Barone et al, 1997) . Finally, neuronal damage in bacterial meningitis and cerebral malaria may also be triggered by TNF-\u03ba (Munoz-Fernandez and Fresno, 1998) . Polymorphisms of the TNF-\u03ba promoter region have been linked to the development of cerebral malaria (Ubalee et al, 2001) .",

Perhaps the most dramatic example of this occurs in mice with targeted deletion of TNFRs (Bruce et al, 1996) . These mice have augmented damage after focal cerebral ischemia or seizures compared to their wild-type controls, leading the authors to conclude that TNF-\u03ba plays a neuroprotective role. Later studies from this group (Gary et al, 1998) established the dependence of neuroprotection on the TNFR-1 receptor, following ischemic insult to the hippocampus, whereas other groups using models of MS (Kassiotis and Kollias, 2001) and retinal ischemia (Fontaine et al, 2002) have demonstrated that TNFR-2 is involved in neuroprotection while TNFR-1 is involved in neurotoxicity in vivo. Perhaps some of the conflicting results observed between in vitro and in vivo studies may be due to the possibility that not all of the neurotoxic effect of TNF-\u03ba seen in these diseases is mediated exclusively by neuronal TNFR activation. For example, TNF-\u03ba likely also participates in secondary injury mechanisms such as glial recruitment and activation of glial TNFRs, thus resulting in glial-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory factors, and other potentially neurotoxic products (Knoblach et al, 1999) .",

Although the \"why\" and \"how\" are difficult to answer, the biological precedents are numerous. Many cytokines and growth factors, including nerve growth factor (NGF), can mediate either neuronal maintenance functions, protection, or death depending on the precise set of circumstances (see Casaccia-Bonnefil et al, 1999; Loddick and Rothwell, 1999; and below) . Therefore, it should be of no surprise to see TNF-\u03ba exhibit similar behavior. There are numerous mitigating factors that may impact what role TNF-\u03ba has under any given set of circumstances.

Both the membrane-anchored and soluble forms are homotrimerically active ligands that specifically bind and crosslink two members of the TNFR superfamily: the 55-kDa TNFR-1 (a.k.a. CD120a) and the 75-kDa TNFR-2 (a.k.a. CD120b), both of which are constitutively expressed in the brain (Vitkovic et al, 2000) . Soluble TNF-\u03ba has similar affinities for TNFR-1 and TNFR-2, but pTNF-\u03ba has a higher affinity for the TNFR-2 . Some nonspecific binding of TNF-\u03ba to the more closely homologous members of the TNFR superfamily, such as the p75NGF receptor, may also occur (Ameloot et al, 2001) . In most cases, receptor activation is thought to result in internalization and perhaps translocation of the receptor-ligand complex to subcellular localizations, although the significance of the role of ligand or receptor internalization is unclear, because many aspects of TNF-\u03ba signaling can still occur when ligand or receptor internalization is inhibited (Jones et al, 1999) .",

In fact, at least one group has reported (in endothelial cells) that although most TNFR-2 molecules are located on the cell surface, the majority of steady-state TNFR-1 are localized to the perinuclear golgi complex (Jones et al, 1999) . However, current understanding is that only the plasma membrane-bound TNFRs associate with the known effector molecules to activate the usual characterized array of downstream cell signals . Soluble TNFRs, on the other hand, may serve as a means for regulating both TNFR surface expression and, because they still retain ligandbinding capacity, TNF-\u03ba bioavailability . The function of subcellularly localized TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 receptors is less clear, because it is possible, but not certain, that TNF-\u03ba binds these receptors, and even if ligand binding occurs, it does not induce association with the usual adapter proteins (Jones et al, 1999) . In the same fashion as soluble TNFRs, this subcellular pool of receptors may also serve to regulate surface receptor density and perhaps TNF-\u03ba bioavailability. Nonetheless, more direct roles for these intracellular receptors are suggested by evidence that TNF-\u03ba activates signaling mechanisms at multiple subcellular locations, and an as yet unidentified TNF-\u03ba -binding protein has been localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane .",

Although the signaling functions of TNFR-2 remain less well understood, it has been shown that TNFR-2 can perform a \"ligand passing\" role for TNFR-1, or otherwise act in concert with TNFR-1 to supplement, enhance, or moderate its effects . Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that TNFR-2 may also subserve some effects of TNF-\u03ba entirely independently of TNFR-1 activation. Based on several knockout studies showing decreased neuronal damage with TNFR-1 knockouts, and increased damage with TNFR-2 knockouts (Fontaine et al, 2002; Yang et al, 2002) , it might also be tempting to conclude that-at least in neurons-TNFR-1 activation induces neuronal cell death, and TNFR-2 activation induces neuronal protection. However, once again, this view may be too simplistic, because TNFR-2 activation alone can promote necrosis in both neuronal cells (Sipe et al, 1998) and non-neuronal cells (Pelagi et al, 2000) . Thus, the role of TNFR-2 in neurons may be not only significant, but also more complicated than the knockout studies might suggest. In short, both TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 can probably transduce either neurotoxic or neuroprotective signals depending on their precise signaling environment.",

The TNFR-1 utilizes an ever-growing list of adapter molecules to initiate three primary signaling pathways in response to activation: the caspase (i.e., apoptosis), c-Jun, and (NF-\u03baB) pathways (Figure 1 ). Although the cellular effects of the latter two pathways can vary with cell type, in neurons, NF-\u03baB activation appears to be an important neuroprotective response to inflammation, whereas activation of the c-Jun pathway usually promotes neuronal death (Maggirwar et al, 2000; Ham et al, 1995; Estus et al, 1994) . Other TNFR-1-activated second messengers thought to be of particular significance to neuronal function(s) include the extracellularly regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK cascade, which is usually neuroprotective (Bahr et al, 2002) , and ceramide production, which is generally considered neurotoxic (Marchetti et al, 2002) , although it may be neuroprotective under some circumstances (Ariga et al, 1998) .

Although TRADD binding to TNFR-1 is sufficient to promote the rest of the apoptotic cascade (i.e., successive activation of Fas-associated death domain (FADD), Faddlike interleukin-1-converting enzyme (FLICE; aka caspase-8, caspases, etc.), subsequent binding of other effector molecules is necessary for activation of the c-Jun and NF-\u03baB pathways. By way of illustration, TNFR-associated factor-2 (TRAF-2) binding to TRADD enables activation of the c-Jun pathway, but further binding of receptor-interacting protein (RIP) to TRAF-2 is necessary for NF-\u03baB induction. In addition, ceramide production can be triggered by both FADD and by a separate receptor domain outside of the death domain, which may account for its sometimes opposing effects (Ariga et al, 1998) . Because TNF-\u03ba binding to TNFR-1 can simultaneously induce all of these pathways, the relative availability of certain downstream effector molecules may control which cellular response pathway takes precedence. Also significant are inhibitory molecules or functions that promote one TNFR-activated cascade while inhibiting another (Rath and Aggarwal, 1999) .",

Instead, TNFR-2 signaling is initiated by TRAF-2 dimers (either homodimers or heterodimers with TRAF-1) associating directly with the activated receptor (Baker and Reddy, 1998), thus enabling the TNFR-2 to activate many of the same pathways as TNFR-1 with the exception of the caspase cascade.

In this fashion, TNFR-2 signaling may be able to convert a TNFR-1 response from neuromodulatory to neurotoxic. Unfortunately, there is little direct evidence in support of this concept in neurons. However, in separate experiments, competitive inhibition of TRAF-2 binding reduced NF-\u03baB activation, and reduced TNFR-1-mediated NF-\u03baB activation enhanced the TNFR-1 apoptotic signal (Brink and Lodish, 1998) , thus supporting this as a plausible mechanism.",

            "text": "Two of the more prominent examples of this kind of crosstalk by second messenger systems include TNF-\u03ba signal interaction with interleukin-1 (IL-1) and NGF. TNF-\u03ba and IL-1 are proinflammatory cytokines that activate nearly identical signaling pathways and transcription factors, and achieve remarkably similar effects, despite structurally unrelated protein and receptor content (Eder, 1997) . Moreover, they have an equally remarkable congruence of effects on brain. In healthy brain tissue, like TNF-\u03ba , IL-1 is also nontoxic and thought to regulate many of the same neuromodulatory activities, but becomes toxic under conditions of brain inflammation or disease (Rothwell et al, 1997) . In achieving these effects, their analogous signaling pathways increase the likelihood of synergistic interactions between these two molecules. Both cytokines use TRAFs (TRAF-2 for TNFR, TRAF-6 for IL-1 receptor ) to activate the NF-\u03baB, c-Jun, and p38 MAP kinase cascades (Eder, 1997) . Although NF-\u03baB activation is usually neuroprotective, activation of c-Jun and the p38 MAPK cascades is usually neurotoxic. Therefore, in an inflamed brain, when both TNF-\u03ba and IL-1 levels rise, increased coactivation of both TNFRs and IL-1Rs might be sufficient to shift the balance from neuroprotective to neurotoxic by increasing activation of the neurotoxic pathways (i.e., c-Jun and p38 MAPK) relative to the neuroprotective one (i.e., NF-\u03baB). There are at least two hypothetical mechanisms by which this might occur in the CNS. First, IL-1R-mediated NF-\u03baB activation may be weaker than TNFR-mediated NF-\u03baB activation, whereas both receptors may activate c-Jun and p38 MAPK equally (Eder, 1997) , thus increasing the likelihood that IL-1/TNFR interaction will exert neurotoxic synergism. Second, the fact that the TNFRs and IL-1Rs utilize only one common neuroprotective pathway (i.e., NF-\u03baB), but at least two different neurotoxic pathways (i.e., c-Jun and p38 MAPK), might result in (1) increased competition for intermediaries in neuroprotective pathways, or perhaps more likely, (2) increased production of the number of unique neurotoxins (with potentially additive or synergistic effects) relative to the number of unique neuroprotectants-either of which would shift the overall net intraneuronal balance towards a neurotoxic cascade. This next contrasting example of TNFR crosstalk involves interaction with NGF, a neurotrophic factor that binds the p75 and TrkA receptors and is capable of inhibiting TNF-\u03ba -induced neuronal cell death (Haviv and Stein, 1999) . Which NGF signaling pathways mediate this inhibition? One might expect that most of the protective effects of NGF would be mediated by TrkA, as p75 usually modulates cell death through activation of the JNK pathway and selected caspases (Casaccia-Bonnefil et al, 1999) . Indeed, TrkA does activate the Akt pathway, a serine/threonine kinase that inhibits the apoptotic cascade by phosphorylating and thus inactivating many downstream apoptosis effectors such as Bad and caspase-9 . TrkA activation also activates the protective MAPK pathway. Either or both of these actions may enhance neuronal survival in the face of increased TNF-\u03ba signaling, although at least for oligodendrocytes, it has been shown that the Akt pathway probably plays a greater role than the MAPK pathway in NGF rescue of TNF-\u03ba -treated cells (Takano et al, 2000) . In addition, coexpression of Trk A with p75 abrogates the latter's death-inducing effect while still allowing it to maintain NF-\u03baB activation (Casaccia-Bonnefil et al, 1999) , which likely further contributes to the reduction of TNF-\u03ba neurotoxicity. Adding to the complexity of these interactions is the possibility that beta-amyloid can stimulate p75 receptors and, together with TNF-\u03ba , exert a synergistic neurotoxic response when TNFRs are colocalized on the same neuron (Perini et al, 2002) .",

TNF-\u03ba activation induces ceramide production, which has been implicated in a large number of pathways contributing to neuronal cell death, including activation of C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); involvement in the neurotoxic phospholipase A2 (PLA2)/arachidonic acid (AA)/reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) signaling pathway; caspase activation, perhaps in part through decreased activity of Akt; and inhibition of some protective protein kinase C (PKC) variants (Goswamia and Dawson, 2000; Macdonald et al, 1999; Ariga et al, 1998; Spiegel et al, 1998) . NGF, in contrast, stimulates ceramidase, which catabolizes ceramide, thus reducing the ceramide-induced activation of any or all of these pathways. Further, NGF also increases sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP) levels, which not only increases neuroprotective MAPK/ERK activation, but also prevents JNK activation and consequent apoptosis by TNF-\u03ba and ceramide (Casaccia-Bonnefil et al, 1999; Spiegel et al, 1998) . Moreover, SPP also has a stimulatory effect on phospholipase D, leading to increased diacylgly cerol (DAG) activity, PKC stimulation, and subsequent activation of ERK and NF-\u03baB cascades, whereas ceramide typically has inhibitory effects on phospholipases and thus reduces DAG generation. However, this last scenario is greatly complicated by the facts that ceramide and SPP can each have opposing effects on different PKC variants, and that PKCs in turn regulate SPP and ceramide levels (Spiegel et al, 1998) . Nonetheless, the more direct effects of NGF-induced SPP activity are likely to play prominent roles in alleviating neurotoxic effects of TNF-\u03bainduced ceramide production.",

Indeed, functionblocking antibodies to either TNF-\u03ba or TNFR-1 prevented apoptosis after withdrawal of NGF in sympathetic or sensory neurons (Barker et al, 2001) , suggesting that TNF-\u03ba facilitates the death of NGFdeprived neurons. Moreover, MacDonald et al (1999) show that AA, a downstream mediator of TNF-\u03ba , causes apoptosis in PC-12 cells by inhibiting NF-\u03baB and PKC-zeta, two components of the NGF signaling pathway. This TNF-\u03ba -induced apoptosis cannot be blocked by NGF. These data argue for inhibition of NGF suvival signals by TNF-\u03ba as another mechanism of intraneuronal receptor crosstalk.",

There are several potential answers to this question. First, perhaps TNF-\u03ba , even at low levels of activity in normal brain, is always capable of inhibiting some survival signals, but this survival inhibition only begins to have a detrimental or neurotoxic effect on neurons when they are otherwise stressed. For example, brain inflammation or disease unleashes numerous cascades contributing to neuronal insult, many of which have been mentioned here. Therefore, under these conditions, neurons become ever-more dependent on opposing neuroprotective mechanisms designed to ensure their survival, and thus also much more sensitive to the effects of inhibition of any of these survival promoting effects. In contrast, under nonstressed or \"normal\" conditions, neurons may be able to tolerate loss of some survival signals without loss of viability. Moreover, there may also be a hypothetical dose threshold at work here, so that only exposure to TNF-\u03ba above a certain level-perhaps above the level that is seen in normal brain-will inhibit survival signals. Similarly, concentrations or relative receptor activity of the survival signaling molecule may have to reach a certain level before inhibition from TNF-\u03ba or other molecules can occur.",

In this scenario, when the redox potential of vulnerable neurons is shifted toward oxidation by increased net production of free radicals or decreased production of free radical-scavenging enzymes, a concentration of TNF-\u03ba that is not normally toxic might induce neuronal apoptosis. Support for this concept comes from Castegne et al (2001), who demonstrated that administration of an NF-\u03baB inhibitor alone following axotomy of retinal ganglion cells was neuroprotective compared to vehicle control. However, coadministration of a glutathione synthesis inhibitor with the NF-\u03baB inhibitor following axotomy caused neuronal apoptosis in these cells. This example demonstrates that either activation or inhibition of the same molecule may have opposing effects depending on the redox status of the cell. This theory may also explain why levels of both TNF-\u03ba and IL-1 alone that are nontoxic in normal brain, then become toxic in inflamed brain (Vitkovic et al, 2000) .",

Cell survival in the no-serum control condition was only about 13% to start with, and increasing doses of TNF-\u03ba (.001 to 10 ng/ml) had little additional toxic effect. However, TNF-\u03ba caused a dose-dependent decrease in the ability of 100 ng/ml IGF-1 to rescue the neurons from serum withdrawal; survival decreased from 80% in the no-serum/no TNF-\u03ba /+ IGF-1 condition to about 20% in the no serum/+ TNF-\u03ba /+ IGF-1 condition. Although TNF-\u03ba itself showed little toxicity in this paradigm, the cells were already at such a low survival level that this does not by any means indicate that TNF-\u03ba at some doses would not show toxicity under more normal culture conditions. More importantly, this serum withdrawal paradigm models a very stressed and therefore unnatural state for the neurons. Thus, it is probably a closer representation of inflamed or diseased brain than it is of \"normal\" brain. Therefore, the findings that TNF-\u03ba inhibited IGF-1 survival signals in this experimental model may be in agreement with the idea that inhibition of IGF-1 (or other survival signals) by TNF-\u03ba (or other molecules) might SW Perry et al only occur, and/or might only reduce neuronal viability, under conditions of high neuronal stress such as brain inflammation or disease.",

            "text": "In any of these crosstalk examples, glia are likely to play a prominent role. Glia activated in response to inflammation are thought to mediate many of the neurotoxic and neuroprotective signals affecting neurons after brain injury. Thus, glial involvement may have much to do with whether TNF-\u03ba or any other molecule is neuroprotective or neurotoxic under any given set of circumstances. For example, both TNF-\u03ba and IL-1 are often nontoxic in pure neuronal cultures, but toxic in neurons cultured with glia (Loddick and Rothwell, 1999; Rothwell et al, 1997) . Further, as we have seen, these effects are often synergistic. In addition, the regional distribution of microglia has a profound influence on the extent of neuronal injury after inflammation-inducing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection . There may be several reasons for these critical effects of glia. Glia are most likely responsible for initiating most cytoprotective or cytotoxic cascades, and producing the majority of the neurotrophic and neurotoxic factors. Furthermore, cytokines or neurotrophic factors may affect a neuron very differently depending on the origin of the signaling molecule, and whether the molecule is acting directly on neuronal receptors, or acting via secondary pathways stimulated by ligand activation of glial receptors. Finally, glia can indirectly affect neurons by altering concentrations of a variety of molecules in the synaptic cleft. For example, reduced glutamate uptake by activated glia has often been attributed to excitotoxic neuronal death in a variety of neurological diseases (Hu et al, 2000) . An additional novel pathological mechanism involves chemokine signaling of stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1\u03ba ) through its cognate receptor CXCR4 on astrocytes to rapidly release TNF-\u03ba into the extracellular space. This process is further amplified by activated microglia (Bezzi et al, 2001) .",

Changing interactions between signaling pathways could explain the shifting roles of TNF-\u03ba at different times in the course of a disease, at differing levels of cellular stress, and perhaps between different classes of disease. Many of these concepts are illustrated in Figure 1 . For example, patterns of cytokine signaling typical of an neuroimmune response to viral infection may interact with TNF-\u03ba signaling in a way that leads to the predominance of toxic effects typically seen during virus-induced neurodegeneration. This may differ from the effects of TNF-\u03ba signaling during neuroimmune responses to other types of agents, which may differ yet again from neuroinflammatory responses in the absence of infectious agents. Moreover, the concept of intraneuronal receptor crosstalk itself implies two key prerequisites that, in many in-stances, are still under-investigated: (1) that receptors for the molecule in question are found colocalized on the same neuron, and (2) that this colocalization occurs in the regions where pathology is found. Published receptor expression studies indicate that this is probable, especially for more ubiquitously expressed molecules like the ones discussed above (Vitkovic et al, 2000) , but nonetheless, more studies specifically addressing receptor colocalization within particular brain regions and in specific neuronal populations need to be performed to fully elucidate this unfolding mystery.",

            "text": "In some situations, these pleiotropic effects of TNF-\u03ba might be explained in light of the hypotheses we present above. For example, primary cell cultures may very well represent more of an inflamed state than a \"normal\" neuronal state, due to physical stress that is inherent in establishing such cell cultures from primary brain tissue. Moreover, even \"pure\" neuronal cultures have varying glial content, which can affect cytokine or neurotrophic factor action. Likewise, the use of immortalized neuronal lines is complicated because the differentiating agents used to create \"neuronal\" phenotypes can activate innumerous complex intracellular signaling pathways regulating cell fate. Furthermore, such cell lines are mitotic, often tumor-derived, and therefore of questionable relevance to normal neuronal physiology. Finally, because cytokine action is closely interrelated with trophic factors, even medium compositions containing differing concentrations of growth factors or other cell factors may be enough to reverse the effects of TNF-\u03ba under otherwise identical experimental conditions.",

            "text": "In other situations, we likely have to look beyond the hypotheses presented here for additional explanations. It has been suggested that for some disease states, like nerve regeneration, early TNF-\u03ba presence may be beneficial to neurons, but become destructive with continued chronic exposure in the later disease state (Stoll et al, 2000) . Diametrically opposed, other investigators have suggested that TNF-\u03ba is toxic in the early postinjury phase, but neuroprotective at later time points (Shohami et al, 1999) . This observation is based on the work of Scherbel et al (1997) in a model of TBI in TNF-\u03ba knockout mice. Following cortical contusion, these mice recovered faster than the wild-type controls, but had greater neurological deficits between 1 and 4 weeks after the injury, suggesting that lack of TNF-\u03ba was implicated in the chronic phase of recovery from TBI. Other work has suggested that pretreatment with TNF-\u03ba confers neuroprotective activity against excitotoxic cell death resulting from brain injury (Gary et al, 1998; Mattson et al, 1997) . Exactly how this pretreatment effect works is unclear. However, it has been shown that cytokines and neurotrophic factors can moderate the levels of other cytokines or neurotrophins and their receptors (Munoz-Fernandez and Fresno, 1998) , and that p75 receptor expression alone confers a relative dependence on neurotrophins (Casaccia-Bonnefil et al, 1999) . It could be posited that TNF-\u03ba pretreatment affects receptor levels of other trophins, or that it reduces neuronal dependence on trophic factors, thus making it protective. Taking all of these results and concepts together, it would be interesting to make a comparison of the effects of TNF-\u03ba in these models when appplied pre-, peri-, or postinjury. For example, as we mentioned earlier, TNF-\u03ba is neuroprotective to hippocampal organotypic slices when applied prior to ischemic stress, but neurotoxic when applied after the same ischemic insult (Wilde et al, 2000) . This and many other examples cited above indicate that timing and duration of TNF-\u03ba exposure relative to injury may well determine whether its effects are neuroprotective or neurotoxic, and elucidation of these critical details is therefore imperative to developing safe and effective therapies for brain injury.",

On evolutionary grounds, why this occurs may be difficult to answer, but it further elucidation of exactly how TNF-\u03ba might exert its many effects will likely come from progress in several areas, including greater understanding of glial involvement in these processes; subcellular localization and function of TNF-\u03ba and other cytokine/neurotrophic factor receptors, especially at the nuclear and mitochondrial levels; regulation of cleavage activity of both TNF-\u03ba and its receptors, and how that affects signaling; regulation of endocytosis of both cleaved and uncleaved receptors and TNF-\u03ba ; other TNF-\u03ba -induced signaling pathways such as Jak/STAT, as well as continued search for additional molecules that inhibit signaling; and finally, how structural analysis of TNF-\u03ba and TNFRs relates to their function.",

To our knowledge, the signaling pathways are the same, yet TNF-\u03ba often has completely contradictory effects in neurons versus other cell types. Thus, as suggested herein, the differentiation state of a neuron may greatly dictate its response to TNF-\u03ba , whether it be in response to a virus, or some other inflammatory response. Lastly, to better understand TNF-\u03ba function in the brain, we also need to further our understanding of the role of TNF-\u03ba in the brain. TNF-\u03ba [a.k.a. lymphotoxin (LT)-\u03ba ] is highly active in the immune system but generally considered to play a lesser role in the brain than TNF-\u03ba (Munoz-Fernandez and Fresno, 1998) , and therefore we made no mention of it here. However, because TNF-\u03ba signals through the exact same receptors as TNF-\u03ba , if it is present in the brain, it could mediate any of the same effects, and participate in the same crosstalk mechanisms, as TNF-\u03ba . For example, in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of MS patients, Kraus et al (2002) recently found that TNF-\u03ba serum levels were significantly elevated in patient subgroups with (1) higher numbers of lesions, and (2) greater disease burden (total lesion area), respectively.",
