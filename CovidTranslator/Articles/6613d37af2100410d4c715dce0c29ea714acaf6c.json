            "text": "Bronchiolitis, Hospitalisation S U M M A R Y Over the last year there have been more studies determining predisposition to severe bronchiolitis and its consequences. Studies have highlighted various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be significantly associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalisation, and a candidate gene approach demonstrated that innate immune gene SNPs had the strongest association with bronchiolitis. The impact of 'other' viruses (RSV, influenza, adenovirus, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus [hMPV], coronavirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, paraechovirus) has been investigated. In one series only children with RSV infection experienced recurrent wheezing and in another only RSV infection was associated with respiratory complications (hypoxia correlated with prolonged hospitalisation). Others have examined the long-term outcome of viral infection in infancy. The above studies and others published in the last year will be discussed.",

The susceptibility to severe RSV infection was influenced by genetic factors (16%), family environment (73%), and non-shared environment (11%).

TLR 4 polymorphisms encoding Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile have been associated with TLR 4 hyporesponsiveness and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. In a study evaluating 105 DNA samples from high-risk patients, heterozygosity for both single nucleotide polymorphisms was associated with symptomatic RSV disease (p<0.00001). 2 In contrast, in another study of 236 children with RSV infection and 219 healthy controls, the Asp299Gly polymorphism was not associated with the risk of severe RSV infection and did not impact on proinflammatory cytokine production. 3 Interleukin (IL)-18 induces interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production and inhibits immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. Polymorphisms of IL-18 are associated with elevated serum IgE levels, atopy and asthma. In a study of 154 children with severe RSV infection and 270 controls, the -133G/C polymorphisms of IL-18 were associated with severe RSV infection (p=0.043). Haplotype analyses revealed associations with all six polymorphisms evaluated in the study (p<0.001). 4 Severe RSV infection is also associated with enhanced chemokine, including RANTES, activity which is increased in epithelial cells and nasal secretions in children with RSV. In 106 children hospitalised with RSV infection and 126 sex-matched healthy adults, the RANTES promoter gene polymorphism, -28C/C-403G/Aln1.1T/T combined genotype was commoner in cases of RSV hospitalisation than in controls (p=0.035). 5 Candidate genes have been investigated in a study of 470 children hospitalised with RSV bronchiolitis, their parents, and 1,008 random population controls. 6 Single nucleotide polymorphisms with the strongest association with bronchiolitis included the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (p=0.0017), the JUN oncogene, which encodes the transcription factor activator protein-1 and is essential for cell cycle progression and DNA replication (p=0.0093), and interferon alpha 5 (IFNA5) (p=0.0093) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) (p=0.0031) ( Figure 1 ). 6 Studies have also evaluated genetic susceptibility to other viral infections. In one study the occurrences of IL-10, IL-18, TLR 4, and IFN-\u03b3 polymorphisms were compared in 139 infants under six months of age hospitalised with bronchiolitis and 400 unselected blood donors. 7 Regarding the proportions of polymorphisms, infants with RSV bronchiolitis did not differ from controls, whereas those with non-RSV bronchiolitis were more likely to have an IL-10 -1082 allele G polymorphism compared with controls (p<0.0001).",

Four hundred sixty-nine children experienced 857 lower respiratory tract infections. RSV lower respiratory tract infections were associated with severe stunting, over-crowding, and the number of siblings under six years of age. A higher educational level of the primary caretaker was protective of infection.",

A prospective population-based cohort study using registry information about hospitalisation in Denmark was conducted to further investigate the relationship between RSV infection and invasive pneumococcal disease. The registry included 17,821 RSV hospitalisations and 7,787 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. In children less than two years of age, hospitalisation for RSV increased the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease during the 30 days after hospitalisation, with a rate ratio of 7.1. The investigators proposed the mechanism for the association was direct damage by the virus resulting in a secondary bacterial infection.",

Wheeze and asthma were evaluated at six months, and at two and five years. In this study, asthma was defined by a doctor diagnosis of asthma ever in the 5 years and current asthma included the presence of asthma and wheeze in the 12-months prior to the 5-year follow-up visit. Wheeze was defined as a high-pitched whistling sound coming from the chest, on expiration. Transient wheeze included wheezing episodes only in the first 3 years of life, late-onset wheeze was defined as no wheezing before 3 years of age with wheeze occurring between 3 and 5 years, persistent wheeze was defined as wheezing all 5 years of the study, and current wheeze was defined as wheeze in the 12 months prior to the 5-year follow-up visit. Analysis of aspirates revealed 69% of episodes were due to viruses, of which 10.9% were RSV and 48.3% were RV. At five years, 28.3% of children had current wheeze. Risk factors for the development of asthma where identified as wheezy infections (OR: 3.4) and/or febrile lower respiratory tract infection as infants (OR: 3.9), especially those caused by RSV or RV infections (OR: 4.1). Importantly, those risk factors were correlated with asthma only in children with sensitisation by two years of age, demonstrating an interaction between early life viral infections and atopy in the causation of asthma.",

Viral infections were determined by antigen detection in the nasopharyngeal aspirate obtained during hospitalisation and antibody determinations in paired sera. RSV was also assessed by rt PCR in frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates. Lung function measurements revealed that the children with an RSV infection compared to those without approximately 8 to 9 years prior to the measurements had evidence at follow up of a restrictive abnormality. In children who had been RSV positive, the FVC was 93.7% of predicted compared with 99.5% in children who had been RSV negative (p=0.009) and the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 )/FVC was 98.4 and 92.9 in children who had been RSV positive and negative, respectively (p=0.033). In a multivariate model, the decreased FVC and essentially normal FEV 1 values suggest that RSV is an independent predictor of lower FVC and that RSV bronchiolitis is associated with a permanent abnormal and restrictive pattern of lung function.",
