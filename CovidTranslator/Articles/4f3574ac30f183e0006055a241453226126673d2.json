Virulent, polytropic MHV-JHM was recovered from multiple maternal tissues, including liver and uterus, as well as placenta and fetus in susceptible BALB/cByJ mice. Fetuses were infected during all 3 trimesters of pregnancy. Low virulence, polytropic MHV-S infected fetuses in a low percentage of susceptible BALB/cByJ dams. Infection of resistant CD-1 mice with MHV-JHM was limited, with no fetal infection. Enterotropic MHV-Y was largely restricted to intestine of BALB/cByJ and CD-1 dams, with minimal dissemination and no fetal infection. Maternally-derived MHV IgG antibody was detectable in pup sera through 4 weeks of age. Antibody titers were generally lower in second litters of the same dam. Cross-fostering experiments showed that antibody was transferred via colostrum and not in utero, and that pups were capable of absorption through 2 weeks of age. Pups nursing immune dams were protected against MHV challenge at 1 and 2 weeks of age, compared to pups nursing naive dams. Immunity to MHV challenge was cross-protective against both antigenically homotypic and heterotypic strains of MHV.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a common and highly contagious coronavirus of laboratory mice. Like other coronaviruses, MHV exists as numerous, constantly changing strains that vary in primary tropism for upper respiratory or enteric mucosa and secondary tropism for several other target organs. Strains of MHV vary considerably in virulence, but most cause brief, clinically silent infections in adult mice. Disease expression is also significantly influenced by host age, genotype and immune status [1] . Difficulty in understanding the biology of MHV clearly emanates from the interaction of all of these variables on outcome of infection. The significance of maternally-derived passive ira-munity and the dynamics of MHV infection during pregnancy have not been adequately explored. Anecdotal natural observations and experimental data using artificial routes of MHV immunization and challenge suggest that MHV infection of neonatal mice can be influenced by maternally-derived passive immunity [I1, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22] . It is unclear if MHV is transmitted in utero. Experimental studies, using artificial routes of inoculation, have both supported and negated vertical transmission of MHV [10, 15, 20] . Clearly, the dynamics of MHV following natural routes of infection in pregnant and postparturient mice needs careful evaluation, so that controlled, experimental data can be extrapolated to the natural situation. This paper examines these questions in an effort to understand this aspect of MHV biology.",

Mice were transferred upon arrival into autoclaved Micro-isolator (Lab Products, Maywood, N J) containment cages containing pine shavings, food and water. Cage handling and changing were performed aseptically as previously described [5] . Mice were killed with carbon dioxide gas, followed by exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Neonatal mice were killed by hypothermia and decapitation. Interim blood samples were drawn by aspiration of blood from the peri-orbital sinus with a Pasteur pipette under light ether anesthesia. Mice were twice inoculated intranasally (i.n.) or per os with 10 gl MHV-JHM, MHV-S or MHV-Y stocks containing approximately 103 median tissue culture infectious doses (TCIDs0), or dilutions thereof. Previous studies have shown that with oronasal inoculation (unlike parenteral routesofinoculation ), MHV disease severity is not affected by higher doses of virus beyond the infectius dose [4] . Tissues collected for virus isolation and sera were stored at --70 \u00b0C until tested.",

In utero transmission would most likely occur during infection of a genetically susceptible dam with a polytropic MHV strain with sufficient virulence to induce disseminated infection of multiple target tissues. Previous studies [7] have demonstrated that BALB/cByJ mice, at 5 days after i.n. MHV-JHM inoculation, would be a suitable model system to test this hypothesis. Groups of timedpregnant and non-pregnant female BALB/cByJ mice were inoculated i.n. with MHV-JHM on days 3, 9, and 15 of pregnancy, then necropsied on day 5 after inoculation (days 8, 14, and 20 of pregnancy). Vertical transmission of a low virulence MHV strain in genetically susceptible mice was tested with MHV-S in BALB/cByJ dams. Like MHV-JHM, MHV-S is polytropic [6] , but is considerably less virulent [5, 12] . Mice were inoculated i.n. with MHV-S on day 15 of pregnancy and necropsied on day 5 after inoculation (day 20 of pregnancy'). Vertical transmission of MHV-JHM in genetically resistant mice was next tested in outbred CD-1 mice. Mice were inoculated i.n. with MHV-JHM on day 15 of pregnancy and necropsied on day 5 after inoculation (day 20 of pregnancy). Since enterotropic MHV strains tend to be highly restrictive in intestinal mucosa, with little dissemination to other organs, vertical transmission of enterotropic MHV-Y in genetically susceptible BALB/cByJ and resistant CD-1 mice [2] was examined. Mice were inoculated per os with MHV-Y on day 15 of pregnancy and necropsied on day 5 after inoculation (day 20 of pregnancy).",

Stage of pregnancy did not affect either the prevalence of infection or virus titers in dam liver and uterus. Virus titers in liver of pregnant mice (7.9 \u00b1 1.0 logl0LDs0/gram) tended to be higher than in non-pregnant females (6.3\u00b1 1.01ogl0LDs0/gram), and were significantly higher than in males (5.9 \u00b1 0.3 logl0LDs0/gram; unpaired t, p~<0.05). Uterine MHV titers among all pregnant mice combined (3.7 \u00b1 1.9 logloLDso/gram) were consistently lower than MHV titers in liver (7.4 \u00b1 1.0 logl0LDso/gram; paired t, P ~< 0.001). Virus antigen was found in endometrial stroma and epithelium. Only 4 of 10 dams that were inoculated on day 3 of pregnancy were pregnant at necropsy, in contrast to an over 80% pregnancy rate among dams inoculated on day 9 and 15 of pregnancy, suggesting fetal resorption or abortion. Additional replicates were not sought, since vertical transmission was verified in 1 of the mice. Virus was demonstrable in both placenta and fetus of this mouse (Fig. 1) . Virus titers in placentas of mice inoculated on days 9 and 15 of pregnancy (6.7 \u00b1 1.21ogl0LDs0/gram) were significantly higher than uterine virus titers (3.7\u00b1 1.91ogl0LDs0/gram; paired t, P~<0.001) and nearly equivalent to liver virus titers (7.4 \u00b1 1.01ogl0LDs0/gram; Fig. 1 ), suggesting a preferential site of viral tropism. This could not have been due to viremia alone, since although all mice inoculated on days 9 and 15 of pregnancy were viremic, blood virus titers (3.9\u00b10.71ogl0LDs0/gram) were lower than placental virus titers . Viral antigen was found throughout placenta, but particularly at the maternal-fetal junction. Vertical transmission of MHV was found to be dependent upon MHV strain and host genotype when genetically susceptible and resistant dams were inoculated with different virus strains at 15 days of pregnancy ( Table 1 ). As noted above, virulent MHV-JHM caused disseminated infection in susceptible BALB/ cByJ mice, as shown by a high prevalence of detectable virus in maternal fiver and uterus, as well as placenta and fetus (Table 1 ). In contrast, avirulent MHV-S infection of susceptible BALB/cByJ mice resulted in a significantly lower prevalence of fetal infection (Chi-square, P ~< 0.001), as well as a lower prevalence of infection in maternal liver and no detectable virus in uterus or placenta (Table 1) . Virus titers in livers with detectable virus were significantly lower than MHV-JHM titers in liver of BALB/cByJ mice ( (Table 1) . Virus titers in liver with detectable virus were significantly lower than MHV-JHM titers in livers of BALB/cByJ mice (unpaired t, P~<0.001), and equivalent to titers observed in MHV-S infected BALB/cByJ livers (Fig. 2) .

Curiously, antibody titers rose in all dams between whelping and weaning of the first litter, but remained static while nursing their second litters. Antibody titers were generally lower in second litter pups compared to first litter pups of the same dams. Based on cross-foster nursing results, maternally derived MHV antibody in suckling mice was colostral, and not placental in origin (Fig. 3) . Pups born to an immune dam but foster-nursed at birth on a naive dam had no detectable serum antibody to MHV (Fig. 3A) . Pups from a naive dam, but foster-nursed at birth on an immune dam had serum antibody to MHV which peaked at 2 weeks and was declining at 3 weeks of age (Fig. 3 B) . When pups were transferred at 2 weeks of age, pups from an immune dam that were foster-nursed on a naive dam had antibody titers at 2 weeks which diminished to undetectable levels by 4 weeks of age (Fig. 3C) . In contrast, pups from a naive dam that were foster-nursed on an immune dam starting at 2 weeks of age had no MHV antibody at the time of transfer, but had absorbed colostral antibody by 3 and 4 weeks of age (Fig. 3 D) .

In a second trial with MHV-S and MHV-JHM challenge of 1 week old pups, similar results were shown with MHV-JHM (Table 4 ). Compared to pups nursing naive dams, pups nursing MHV-S immune dams were protected against MHV-S (Chi-square, P~<0.001), but not MHV-JHM challenge. Pups nursing MHV-JHM-immune dams were protected against both MHV-JHM and MHV-S challenge (Chi-square, P ~< 0.01 and P ~< 0.001, respectively). Thus, passive immunity to MHV challenge is effectively conferred to 1 and 2 week old pups following infection of the dam by a natural route of inoculation and resistance does not appear to be virus strain-specific.

Low virulence, polytropic MHV-S could also be transmitted in utero in BALB mice, but not as efficiently as MHV-JHM. The restrictive enterotropism of MHV-Y precluded multisystemic infection of the dams, and thus fetal infection, regardless of genotype. The present study suggests that the physiological state of pregnancy may also increase host susceptibility to MHV, based on MHV-JHM titers in maternal livers. Vertical transmission occurred during all 3 trimesters of pregnancy, which is in agreement with others when ICR mice were inoculated intravenously with MHV-JHM [15] .

The data presented in this paper show that dams, immunized by a more natural means (recovery from oronasal inoculation of MHV), also confer significant protection to their young against MHV challenge. Furthermore, we have shown that colostrally-derived immunity is cross-protective against antigenically heterotypic strains of MHV. Although all MHV strains are antigenically crossreactive, active immunity is directed against strain-specific components of the virion [3] . Stronger challenge resistance was conferred by dams immunized with MHV-JHM compared to MHV-S, presumably because the more severe infection of the dam by MHV-JHM stimulated a stronger immune response. Passive immunity was effective in pups at both 1 and 2 weeks of age, intervals when they are highly susceptible to MHV. Age-related resistance to MHV evolves between 2 and 3 weeks of age [1] .",

            "text": "These findings allow a rational approach to control and detection of MHV in breeding populations of mice. Natural infections with MHV are likely to be short-term and mild, and spread rapidly through a population [1] . The likelihood of active infection during pregnancy in an MHV-naive mouse is therefore statistically remote. The appropriate combination of host genotype and virus strain for successful in utero infection is likewise remote. Thus, although MHV can potentially be vertically transmitted, it is unlikely. Concern over in utero transmission is valid during cesarean rederivation, but this can be circumvented by breeding MHV seropositive, recovered mice, and protecting such mice from exposure to another strain of MHV during pregnancy. Based on our current findings, progeny that have been rederived by hysterotomy and foster nursed on MHV-naive dams should be seronegative to MHV at birth, and certainly at weaning. If seropositive dams are bred and allowed to whelp, their progeny should be seronegative by 6 weeks of age. If pups are foster-nursed on naive dams, they should be seronegative at or before weaning. Rederivation of MHVfree progeny without hysterotomy has been recently demonstrated with enzootically infected stock, using foster dams or by breeding recovered dams [17, 24] .",
