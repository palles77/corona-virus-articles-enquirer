Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-time lockdown is one where the midpoint of the lockdown period coincides with the actual peak of the spread of the disease in the absence of the lockdown. We further show that the true effectivity of imposing a lockdown may be misrepresented and grossly underestimated by the reported case trajectories in the days following the action.",

After a slow month and a half, the virus spread through the rest of the world with a ferocity that has taken doctors, scientists as well as public health officials by surprise. As we write this, the number of cases globally is almost 4,20,000 with more than 18,500 fatalities on record. China remains the most severely affected country with 81,000 cases, Italy is a close second with almost 70,000 and USA is third at 55,000. Whereas the rate of growth of new cases has slowed down to a crawl in China on account of the earlier start of the outbreak as well as several other factors, the growth rates in the rest of the world remain frighteningly high [2] . The worldwide explosion in the number of cases, together with a very high mortality rate in some countries, has resulted in extreme public health measures being adopted across the globe. Full lockdowns have already been imposed in Italy, Spain, France and in California and New York State in USA. These lockdowns followed a slew of increasingly strict social distancing measures such as cancellation of sporting events, suspension of classes, limitation of public gatherings to size 50, and closure of bars, discotheques and other entertainment venues. On Monday, a nationwide lockdown was declared in the United Kingdom, after weeks of deliberation and debate on the adverse socio-economic impacts of such a move, as the growth in new Coronavirus cases kept accelerating relentlessly. Just yesterday, a similar move was announced in India, and today in New Zealand, both ostensibly less-affected countries, after several days of steady and continuous increments in the numbers of cases.",

The specific route of transmission to human from natural reservoirs is still yet to be known, however, some studies suggest that pangolins could be the intermediate mammalian hosts. Since the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are nearly identical to those of a virus isolated from pangolin, it is believed that pangolins could have provided a partial spike gene to SARS-CoV-2, to infect mammals [12, 13] . A recent study has also shown a development of new variations at the functional sites in the receptor-binding domain of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin, likely caused either due to a natural selection or due to mutations and recombination, or both [14] .",

CDC believed that this virus was a result of reassortment, a process through which two or more influenza viruses exchange genetic information by infecting a single human or animal host. A public health emergency was declared back then, but the death rate was lower than that of the seasonal flu (between 0.001 and 0.007 percent). This prevented the epidemic from escalating into COVID-19 proportions. Further, several vaccines were later developed which has significantly brought down the death rate since then.",

Their basic variables were x, the number of people susceptible to the epidemic, y the number of people infected by it and z, the number of people recovered from it (or killed by it). Their pioneering study formed the basis of the S-I-R (susceptible-infected-recovered) model which has since been applied to influenza [24] , dengue [25] and Ebola virus outbreaks [26] . Numerous modifications to the basic model have been proposed over the years; the one which is most relevant for us is the addition of delay [27, 28] . In these works, the delay represents the incubation period i.e. the gap between a person's being exposed to the pathogen and his/her turning infectious. These and similar models may be considered as lumped-parameter models, in the sense that they feature a small number of parameters which represent averages over various kinds of population, for example the young and the old, the healthy and the constitutionally infirm. The advantage of these models is that they are considerably simple, easy to use, and yet capable of yielding the broad trajectory of the epidemic in a region with high accuracy.",

[29] modelled the early phases of the outbreak in Wuhan to estimate the value of R0 there. The number they obtained was between 1.6 and 2.6. A similar study, determination of R0 as a function of time, has been performed by Feng et. al. [30] , whereas an extensive determination of parameters in the S-I-R model has been done by Rabajante [31] . Peng et. al. [32] use a similar model but with a different purpose -they predict the long-term course of the outbreak in Wuhan as well as in the rest of China. Chen et. al. [33] have used a more complicated model with 14 dynamical variables to explain the transmission of the virus from bats to humans and thereafter its spread in the human population. Neher et. al. [34] have introduced a parametric excitation into the basic S-I-R model to study the effects of seasonal temperature variation on the spread of the epidemic. As alternative approaches to the modeling, we would like to cite References [35, 36] which have used stochastic models to analyse the course of the disease in Wuhan and on the cruise ship Diamond Princess respectively. A mathematical analysis of the consequences of public health policy is Reference [37] which predicts the effects of various kinds of social distancing measures such as school closures and social isolation of the high-risk senior citizens. The models in this paper are based on individual-based stochastic influenza models [38] . As recently as the day before yesterday, a new study [39] has emerged which explores the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (social distancing etc) on the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. The mathematical core of this work is a stochastic model, once again for influenza [40] . Another recent work [41] attempts to find the required hospital capacity in Chicago in the presence and absence of a lockdown, using the model [34] . Yet another contribution [42] predicts the effects of imposing a lockdown in India, using an in-house lumped-parameter model. This model is based on S-I-R and accounts for the variation in susceptibility across different age groups. It also accounts for quarantining. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 29.20047035 doi: medRxiv preprint One of the features indigenous to this new and dangerous Coronavirus strain is that there are time lags involved in several stages of the transmission dynamics. One major delay step is that patients become transmissible before showing symptoms of the disease [43] ; in other words, there is a time gap or latency period between the time a patient turns infectious and time that s/he manifests symptoms. A second delay step comes from the fact that, on account of the element of surprise associated with the pandemic, testing facilities in many countries and regions are inadequate relative to the number of cases taking place. For example, the testing rate in USA increased by a factor of ten from 03 March to 17 March [44] , with some states such as New York achieving the maximum testing rates. Similarly, in India, Russia and some European countries, the testing rate is also undergoing a sharp increase even as we write. A limitation in the number of testing facilities means that there is a waiting period involved between the time that a patient reports with symptoms to an isolation-cum-testing facility and the time that the test results actually arrive. In South Korea on the other hand, there was a huge number of testing centres to begin with and this wait was very small. The role of testing delay in the Ebola epidemic has been discussed in Reference [45] .",

We follow the tradition with a variation. First, recall that by our definition, sick people stay sick for all time. However, they do not transmit the disease for all time. Consider an asymptomatic carrier who remains exposed to society throughout. We assume that the number of asymptomatics is proportional to the total number of sick people exposed to society, i.e. we let the number of asymptomatics be \u03bc1y where \u03bc1 is a number between 0 and 1. After falling sick, an asymptomatic carrier can transmit the disease for 7-10 days, which is called the infection period [46] . Thus, new healthy people can be only be infected by those asymptomatic sick people who have fallen sick within the last 7-10 days, and not those who have fallen sick earlier. The number of such people is the number of asymptomatic sick people today minus the number of those 7-10 days earlier i.e. it is ( )",

The logic leading to the retardation is important -we shall use it again. The other contributions to R2 are easier. R2 b is the number of anticipatory quarantines -these are typically made by contact tracing of existing cases, so it is reasonable to assume a form k3xw. This assumes that the tracing and quarantining are done nearly instantaneously, which is reasonable since the time scale involved is usually a few hours and not days. The proportionality to x in this term ensures that if the number of healthy people at large is very small, then also huge numbers don't get quarantined through contact tracing. Finally, R2 c represents the fact that there are some people who do not have the Coronavirus but display similar symptoms as a result of other illnesses for example flu.

We measure time in days, from t = 0 to t = 100, at which point we assume that the epidemic is over (for example through change in temperature, mutation of the virus, development of a cure etc). We use the time step h = 0.001 day. We assume that the population of the region is 500 units (for the plots we shall normalize to unity but for the simulation, a larger number proved convenient). The benchmark parameter values we consider are k0 = k3 = 0.0008, k4 = 0.0004, \u03bc1 = 0.18, \u03bc2 = 0.02, and the delays \u03c41 = 7, \u03c42 = 3 and \u03c43 = 5 (we shall explain some of the choices later). A delay differential equation needs to be seeded with initial functions lasting as long as the maximum delay involved in the problem. Here, this maximum is 15. So we have gone with the initial functions x (t) = 500 \u2212 t/15, y (t) = t/15, z (t) = 0 and w (t) = 2 x 10 \u22126 for the time interval [0, 15] . This assumes a slow growth of the epidemic during the seeding period. The time traces of x, y, z and w for this run are shown in the Figure below. Here and henceforth, we plot x in blue, y in green, z in red and w in grey. In the rate plots which appear later, we shall use the same colour scheme for the time derivatives of these four variables. We also normalize the initial population to unity. The results are physically plausible with the number of healthy at large people (blue) decreasing over time and the various other populations increasing over time. Before proceeding further, we briefly comment on the parameter values for this run. The values of \u03c41, \u03c42 and \u03bc1 come from virological studies and are approximately independent of region. For \u03c42, Reference [43] reports that patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 already carried significant viral loads. Since the median incubation period for COVID-19 estimated there and elsewhere [16] is about 5 days, we have taken \u03c42 to be 3 days, or approximately half .

The benchmark \u03bc1 comes from Reference [50] . The parameters \u03c43, k3, k4 and \u03bc2 on the other hand are region-specific and they come from records collected at the testing facilities in the region. Here we have gone with average, plausible values -when modeling a specific region they will need to be determined from the data. The most important parameter in the model is k0 which has both virological and region-dependent contributions -here we have chosen it so as to generate a peak in reported cases at about 35-40 days after initiation. We have found that the results which we shall claim in the subsequent pages are to a large degree independent of the exact numerical values of the parameters and hold true whenever there is a general spreading profile of a sharp peak surrounded by flats on both sides. Later in this Section, we shall give an example of how to estimate the parameters by fitting the model to an available data set. We note that for the benchmark run, the fraction of healthy at large people remaining at the end of the 100day period is 31 percent of the initial value. This number will be useful in comparing the disease trajectories as the parameters are varied.",

Accordingly we reduce k0 from 0.008 to 0.006 and plot the run below. There is a drastic increase in the ultimate number of healthy at large people, to more than 80 percent of the initial population. In a series of test runs (not shown here), we also find that increasing the value of k0 causes the peak in the transmission rate to appear earlier and be higher, which is consistent with the known fact that social distancing broadens and flattens the peak.

The data ends on the 33 rd day (yesterday) with the number of cases at 9037. The raw data is given below, as Table 1 . An interesting feature of the data is that the growth rate rises to a maximum of about 700/day on days 08-10, then falls rapidly upto day 20 but thereafter becomes almost constant at 100/day for the next 13 days as the cases increase linearly with time. 01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11  Cases  204  346  602  763  977  1261 1766 2337 3150 3736 4212  Day  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  Cases  4812 5328 5766 6284 6767 7134 7382 7513 7755 7869 7979  Day  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  Cases 8086 8162 8236 8320 8413 8565 8652 8799 8897 8961 9037 This data has to be fitted to a curve for w(t), obtained from our model (7) . When fitting, the first thing to note is that South Korea has a population of 5,17,00,000 [53], in comparison to which the number of cases is negligible. This is because the bulk of the outbreak occurred in several localized regions which were very effectively cut off from mingling with other, uncontaminated regions. Hence, the initial x in this case will not be South Korea's entire population but an effective value which takes into account the heavily localized character of the affected regions, where mixing of population took place. We find that this effective value naturally comes out of an attempt to fit the known curve. Since \u03c41 and \u03c42 represent biological properties of the virus, we keep them fixed at 7 and 3 days respectively. South Korea has been extremely proactive at testing, so we set \u03c43 = 2. We keep the seeding period at 15 days, assuming linear growth of y and w during this phase. We choose the growth rate so that w becomes equal to 100 at the start of the free evolution and make the ad hoc assumption that at this time there are thrice as many undetected cases as reported ones (this assumption is harmless -changing the number from 3 to 10 makes almost no difference with respect to the trajectory of the disease).

This fraction is similar to the predictions commonly made with respect to the spread of the virus in free society if steps are not taken to reduce social contacts. We again note however, that a fit of the model to data from an entire country is heuristic at best on account of the huge spatial variation of the infection rate, and the model's assumption of homogeneous mixing among the population.

The time interval between the two peaks is approximately 8 days, which corresponds to \u03c42 + \u03c43. To further bolster this conjecture, we increase \u03c42 to 4 (which makes an even more virulent epidemic with 20 percent of x remaining after 100 days) and reduce \u03c43 to 1. The plot is given below. This time, there is a 5-6 day separation between the two peaks, as we would expect. Other runs, not shown here, with different values of k0 and \u03c4's also bring out the truth of the conjecture that the peak in w occurs a time approximately \u03c42 + \u03c43 after the peak in y. Thus, the numerical values of the parameters are actually not too important so far as this prediction is concerned. Note that \u03c41, technically also a delay term, does not enter here. The lag between actual and reported results is entirely on account of the two delays which are novel to the Coronavirus. Going back to Figure 6 , we can see that when y has peaked, w is still strongly in the ascending region. This implies that, in the initial stages where the numbers of reported cases are increasing strongly, the disease is actually much closer to its peak and spreading much faster than the numbers would indicate. Hence, measures such as lockdowns and enforced social isolation, is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 29.20047035 doi: medRxiv preprint which reduce the spread of the disease by reducing k0, need to be implemented as soon as there is a significant growth in the numbers being reported. Waiting for the disease to get \"closer to peak\" before implementing lockdowns can actually be a sub-optimal policy as that will enforce the curbs after the disease has already spread like wildfire. There is however a brighter side to this picture, which is that when w has peaked, y is well into the trailing region. Thus, the epidemic is closer to the end that we would otherwise imagine on the basis of a raw interpretation of the data. (As a parenthetical note, this disparity between the actual and reported case histories would have been impossible to obtain from a traditional S-I-R model, which validates our unconventional choice of basic variables.)",

If this figure is maintained throughout the 100-day period then there is almost no spread of the epidemic with 98 percent of healthy at large population remaining at the end of the period.

For the first run, we implement a very early lockdown from t = 20 to t = 35. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 29.20047035 doi: medRxiv preprint This is an ineffective move -the disease remains quiescent during the lockdown but explodes after the restrictions are lifted. A similar phenomenon also happens for a range of early lockdowns, thus nullifying their effect completely. This runs contrary to the perception that locking down at the earliest signs of spread is the strategy to adopt -it is good if the lockdown can be indefinite but inutile when there are external constraints on its duration. Similarly, a lockdown at too late a stage (after the disease has peaked) is also useless, for obvious reasons. We find that the optimal time of imposing the lockdown is such that the centre of the lockdown period corresponds to the peak in y in the absence of the lockdown. For the next run, we impose lockdown from t = 37 to t = 52, straddling the y-peak at t = 44. The results are presented below. This well-timed lockdown cripples the flow of the disease before it approaches its peak. Moreover, the disease does not restart its virulent spread after the curbs are eased. The remaining fraction of x at the end of the 100-day period turns out to be 53 percent. Instead, if we impose the 15-day lockdown with its centre coinciding with the (no lockdown) peak in w, i.e. from t = 45 to t = 60, then too the flow of the disease is choked but the remaining fraction of x reduces to 45 percent, which is a nearly 1/5 drop from the previous case. In the next plot, we vary the starting point of the 15-day lockdown from the 20 th day to the 55 th day and plot the remaining percentage of x at the end of the 100-day period.

Another feature of the bottom panel of Fig. 10 is extremely important. We see from the grey curve that the rate of detected cases dw/dt keeps increasing even after the lockdown has been imposed. Indeed, in a qualitative sense, w in the presence of the lockdown proceeds smoothly to a peak and then tails off, just as it would have in the absence of the lockdown (there is a spike at the instant the lockdown is lifted but that is probably a numerical artefact and unlikely to manifest in practice). This might mislead one to believe that the lockdown has been ineffective. However, the actual decrease, and a very significant one at that, has taken place in a quantity (y) which cannot be measured directly. The height of the peak in w with the lockdown in place (about 0.007) has also reduced drastically relative to that without the lockdown (Fig. 7 , height about 0.019) -once again, a comparison with an unmeasurable quantity. Thus we see that the lockdown serves its purpose even if this is not apparent from the limited data (detected case trajectory) at our disposal. This is very likely the explanation behind the apparent futility of the lockdowns imposed in Italy and Spain, where the numbers of cases continue to rise aggressively even after the most drastic social isolation measures have been implemented. We shudder to think what these numbers would have been if the lockdowns had not been imposed when they were. We also note that the apparent lack of qualitative change after a lockdown can only be found from our delayed model and not from a real-time S-I-R model for example Reference [42] .",

We consider a region which is still approaching the peak and has implemented zero or partial social distancing measures. The biological parameters \u03c41, \u03c42 and \u03bc1 will remain fixed, at the values used here or at values which the authorities obtain from their (likely more comprehensive) data sets. The initial value x (0) will be some fraction of the total population of the region (accounting for people who are resistant, people who are very seldom outdoors etc). Authorities can use their testing records to find approximate values of \u03c43, k3, k4 and \u03bc2. Thereafter, the extant data for w (t) can be fitted to the model to determine a basic k0, and further refine the estimates of the other parameters. Given these, the authorities can now find the location of the expected peak in y, and impose a limited-duration lockdown centred round that peak. Figure 11 indicates that there is some margin of error here -the remaining percentage stays above 50 if the lockdown is imposed any time between the 34 th and 42 nd day.

For example, one can take into account the effects of errors in testing and intentional or unintentional violations of quarantine. According to the Institute of Medicine (IoM) categories, drivers of pathogen emergence like human demographics and behaviour, economic development and land use, international travel and commerce, changing ecosystems and human susceptibility should also be taken into consideration. One can also integrate our lumped-parameter model with more detailed analyses which account for heterogeneous spatial mixing and stochasticity in contracting the disease. Such steps will increase even more the predictive power of the model, and further help regional authorities in timing their lockdowns, and estimating the required capacities of quarantine and treatment facilities. * * * * *",
