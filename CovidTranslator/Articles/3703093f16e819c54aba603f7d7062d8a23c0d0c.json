            "text": "Molecular diagnostic is a series of techniques which are used for sensitively analysing biomarkers in the genome and the proteome-genetic code of individuals in vitro [1] . In the past several decades, it was rapidly developed to guide patient care management in the field of infectious diseases, cancers and so on. The increasing demand for the information of genetic and genomic leads to the rapid advances of molecular techniques [2] . Among most molecular diagnostic methods for nucleic acid biomarkers detection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the most widely used method for vastly increasing the number of nucleic acid molecules [3e5] . To make the molecular diagnostic test simpler and more portable, a suite of isothermal amplification techniques have been invented, such as rolling circle amplification (RCA) [6] , helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) [7] , recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) [8] , and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [9, 10] . These methods can realize the exponential amplification at constant temperature which could facilitate the point-of-care (POC) gene detection [11e17] . However, these assays are generally still impractical for real applications, because of the resource poor settings as well as the high frequency to generate false positive results [18e20] . With the purpose of improving the detection specificity and achieving more simple and reliable readout, we recently developed an innovation in which one-step nucleic strand displacement reaction (usually shortened as OSD) was adapted, instead of traditional fluorescent intercalating dyes, to probe the products of isothermal amplifications (e.g., LAMP). Due to the high sequence specificity, the possibility of false positive signals has been reduced at the maximum degree. Even though, unlike the intercalating dyes that can provide signal amplification via interacting with all the base pairs of the LAMP amplicons [21e23], one OSD probe can be activated by a single LAMP amplicon [24e26] . Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio or the observable signal change may be usually not significant enough to satisfy practical usage.",

            "text": "In order to overcome the above potential shortage and further enable the detection practical in more possible operation environments and settings, herein we import another innovation through updating the OSD probe with an enzyme-free nucleic acid circuit, the hybridized chain reaction (HCR). As an integration of multiple OSDs, the HCR reaction was firstly invented by Pierce group [27] and immediately became a starring signal amplifier due to high amplification efficiency and compatibility to different readouts [28e32]. In assistance of HCR, a variety of proof-ofconcept targets, including cancer cells, microRNA, metal ions, and many aptamer ligands have been detected with improved sensitivity [33e36]. In this paper, through designing partial of LAMP amplicon sequence as the input sequence to trigger HCR reaction, we for the first time couple the LAMP and HCR together to achieve both ultra-sensitivity and significant signal change for general gene targets. And different transduction strategies were developed to make sure the products of LAMP-HCR could be flexibly monitored via many kinds of available settings (readouts), e.g. gel electrophoresis, flow cytometer (FCM) and even a commercial personal glucometer (PGM). The practicability of the method has thus been largely improved.",

            "text": "Recently, the very contagious noroviruses (NoVs) have become the leading cause of sporadic gastroenteritis across all age groups, especially pediatric populations. It was reported that 26% of 4000 fecal samples from Chinese pediatric out patients were NoVpositive with more than 98% belonging to GII [37, 38] . As a response to the urgent demand for more accurate and reliable detection, here the gene segments of NoV GII was specifically employed as the model target [39] . In spite of their high sensitivity, earlier reports like electron microscopy [40, 41] , immunology-based detection (radioimmunoassay (RIA) [42, 43] , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) [44, 45] ) and nucleic acids biomarkers detection based on gene amplification techniques (PCR [46, 47] , nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [48, 49] , LAMP [50, 51] ) always lack of specificity and false positive results can easily arise. Herein, the powerful exponential amplification of LAMP results in ultrasensitive NoV gene detection with a detection limit of 30 copies, while the HCR gives rise to very good specificity and reliable signal changes in all kinds of readouts. And all of the three readouts can be compatible with fecal samples. Compared with fluorescence (gel electrophoresis and fluorescent reader), the FCM and PGM signals were more stable and interference-resistant because of the importance of magnetic beads (MBs) separation.",

A standard HCR reaction uses one single stranded oligonucleotide as trigger, and two hairpin oligonucleotides, H1 and H2, as substrates. The trigger successively opens H1 and H2 via two OSD reactions, and then starts an elongation cascade reaction continuously to form long, nicked duplex products. Herein the sequence of H1 and H2 were designed by using the Bc-Loop as the trigger. H1, H2, and the LAMP amplicons were mixed with Bio-H1-labelled MBs to trigger the HCR at the same time.",

The nicked double stranded DNA (dsDNA) could be finally formed on the surface of MBs. On one hand, if the probe H1 and H2 were modified with fluorochrome, the HCR triggered by LAMP could result in the accumulation of large amount of fluorophores on the MBs. By reading the FCM signals of the fluorescent MBs, the NoV gene can be directly analysed. On the other hand, the well-designed P15eH2 serves as a tail probe and the 15 bases extension could not disturb the LAMP to trigger HCR. In this case, after the HCR, the numerous tailed sequences, which were extended from the nicked dsDNA on the MBs' surface, could hybridize with its complementary DNA labelled with invertase (i.e., P15-Inv). Followed by the washing and separation steps, the re-suspended MBs with invertase could hydrolyze sucrose into glucose which can be detected by using the commercial PGM.",

The standard procedures of LAMP reaction were optimized by real-time fluorescence with the OSD reaction (Fig. S1, SI) . The OSD reporter was designed for Bc-Loop sequence (Fig. 1A) . After the optimization, 1.4 mM each BIP and FIP primers, 0.35 mM each B3 and F3 primers, 1 M betaine, 0.6 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgSO 4 , and 1 mL of 8000 units/mL Bst 2.0 DNA Polymerase in 1 \u00c2 iso buffer were employed as the LAMP reagents, followed by a constant 65 C reaction. Under the optimal conditions, as few as 30 copies nucleic acid templates of NoV could be detected within 1 h in 0.1% fecal samples ( Fig. 1B and C) . It should be noted actually the LAMP-OSD is already a ready-to-use method for efficient NoV detection. However, the concern is even with plenty of optimizations, the signal magnitude of the fluorescence signal (NoV positive) over background (NoV negative) is still not satisfied. Sometimes the signals may even be too small to be distinguished from the non-specific fluorescence increase generated by unknown interferences, especially when fecal sample concentrations are increased ( Fig. 1D and E) or non-specific amplifications (Fig. S2 , in SI) are induced. Actually, this problem may commonly exist in the detection for many other gene targets.

These results exhibited the MBs based LAMP-HCR strategy realized robust NoV detection and was more resistant to interference than the real-time fluorescence assay, where the fluorescence signal could be decreased with the increased concentrations of fecal samples ( Fig. 1D and Fig. S6 , in SI). The reproducibility test performed in 2% human fecal consists of three parallel assays, detecting both NoV positive samples (2 \u00c2 10 5 copies of NoV DNA) and buffer negative controls on three days, respectively ( Fig. 3E and F) . As expected, only small standard deviations were yielded by all nine sets of measurements (i.e., 94.0 MFI and 278 MFI for negative response (448 MFI) and positive response (2031 MFI), respectively). Besides sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility, the re-usability of the Bio-H1-labelled MBs after detection is easy to regenerate by heating the MBs at 80 C for 15 min, immediately followed by a quick separation of the Bio-H1-labelled MBs from other reagents (i.e., FAM-H1, FAM-H2 and LAMP products), leading to the regenerated modified MBs. The successful regeneration could be verified by the subsequent detection with the same result as that of the first one (Fig. S7, in SI) . Note that, the Bio-H1-labelled MBs could be reused at least but may be not limited to twice. The aggregation of MBs could occur under too much repeated regeneration, resulting in unreliable detection results. Encouragingly, the cost of per analysis could be controlled within 1 dollar, which makes it suitable for POC gene biomarker analysis.",

Here, P15eH2 with a tail sequence can hybridize with its complementary DNA labelled with invertase (P15-Inv). After washing and separation steps, the invertase attached on MBs hydrolyzed sucrose into glucose, which could be detected by PGM. Firstly, Mimic-T was chosen for investigating the HCR process (Fig. 4A) . With the increasing concentration of Mimic-T, the signal amplitude (DGMS) of PGM gradually increased. Then, instead of Mimic-T, LAMP amplicons could also trigger the HCR on the surface of MBs, following the hybridization of P15-Inv with the HCR products on the MBs. Fig. 4B shows a positive signal compared with negative control (non-cognate Rotavirus LAMP products). Remarkably, as few as 30 copies of NoV in 2% human fecal sample can produce an obvious amplitude, reaching up to 156 mg/dl. The agarose gel electrophoretic result also shows that HCR reaction occurred with NoV LAMP amplicons introduced (Fig. 4C) . The reproducibility test of this PGM assay was also carried out under the same experimental condition as the FCM assay. The DGMS values for detecting 2 \u00c2 10 5 copies of NoV in 2% human fecal on three days were comparable (Fig. 4D) , showing a very low standard deviation of 17 mg/dl.",

And for signal reporting, fluorophore FAM and its Quencher was, in respective, tagged onto Bio-Reporter-F and Reporter-Q. In presence of LAMP amplicons, the Bc-loop could initiate a strand displacement reaction and kick the Reporter-Q away from Bio-Reporter-F, finally leaving Bio-Reporter-F/Bc-loop (in amplicons) duplex on the MBs. Therefore, the MBs were lightened up with higher fluorescence emission. When such a process was transferred onto FCM assay, the sample with NoVs LAMP amplicons showed a tiny right-migration in the FL1 channel, indicating the success of the LAMP-OSD detection. However, the absolute (Fig. 5B ) and relative MFI (Fig. 5C ) values were all much smaller than those obtained from the LAMP-HCR detection.",

In general, compared with various NoVs gene detection methods (Table S2 , in SI), the present work proved much more reliable and reproducible. The LAMP reactions and transducers (i.e., OSD or HCR) we have developed are comparably sensitive but also sequence-specific to ensure low false positives. The sensitivity down to 30 gene copies is mainly contributed by the LAMP reaction. When the OSD signal suffers unsatisfied signal change, HCR reaction can further provide the ultra-selectivity and higher signal-tobackground ratio which has usually and seriously affected the accuracy for LAMP and other enzymatic amplifications. The detection is very practical, low-cost and almost enough to be ready-to-use. And the readouts should be very flexible, exhibiting great potential to be used in the diagnosis of gastroenteritis in the hospital or even at home with the read out by the portable PGM. ",
