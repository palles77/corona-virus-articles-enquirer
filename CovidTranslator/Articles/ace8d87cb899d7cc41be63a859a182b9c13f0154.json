In calves, diarrhea due to rotavirus appears mostly in the first 2 wk of life [2, 3] . The induction of active immunity, both locally in the intestine and systemically, following oral vaccination or experimental infection of the calf, has been reported [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . For instance, orally vaccinated calves challenged 48-72 h after vaccination remained normal and showed a significant neutralizing antibody response in the intestine and in the serum [5, 6] . Bachmann et al. [4] detected specific antibodies in the jejunum and in the feces 2-12 days and 4-8 days respectively following the rotavirus infection. A similar observation was also reported by Van Zaane et al. [7] who detected specific fecal antibodies of IgM and IgA classes 5 and 10 days respectively, after the rotavirus infection. Another study [8] showed that inoculation of attenuated bovine rotavirus either orally or directly into an isolated intestinal loop induced the appearance of rotavirus antibody-producing cells located in the mucosa of the proximal small intestine with a local production of specific immunoglobulins mainly of the IgA class.",

The specific antirotaviral antibodies, mainly IgG~, present in the colostrum and milk of the vaccinated cows were shown responsible for that passive protection. On the other hand, cell mediated immunity (CMI) is considered important in the protection and recovery of certain viral infections [13] [14] [15] . The lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) which is a blastic transformation in response to the mitogens or antigens including the infectious agents is used as an in vitro correlate of CMI in animals and humans [16, 17] . The purpose of the present study is to report the standardization and application of the LST as an in vitro correlate of CMI in the bovine following systemic immunization with adjuvanted bovine rotavirus.",

Optimal results were obtained after 4 days of incubation with 5 x 105 lymphocytes per culture stimulated with 5 x 10 6 TCIDs0 inactivated viral particles. A lower lymphocyte specific activity, as determined by the SI values after 5 or 3 days of cell culture incubation, was probably due to a diminution in cell nutrients resulting in mortality of the cells or a shorter time of antigenic recognition by the lymphocytes respectively. However, the possible presence of suppressive cells or molecules such as prostaglandins [17] in the cell cultures might also explain that lower lymphocyte activity. A good correlation was also obtained for the SI values and the increasing number of the cells in each culture, enhancing the probability of contact between the sensitized lymphocytes and the antigen. The ratio of 10 viral particles for each mononuclear cell gave the best results in this study. However, in one experiment, higher ratio of 20 viral particles for each cell (5 \u00d7 10 6 viral particles vs 2.5 \u00d7 105 cells per culture) [ Table 1 ] did not contribute to a significant augmentation of the SI. The use of inactivated virus particles as specific antigen in the LST was chosen instead of the live virus since it has been reported in humans that rotaviruses may infect leukocytes under mitogen stimulation [26] , with a potential abrogation of lymphocyte metabolism or of cell mortality.",

Furthermore, the specific in vitro lymphocyte stimulation coincided with maximal antibody titers in the serum of the same calves. The need for more than one immunization correlated with the secondary immune response which was obtained after the booster vaccine inoculations. As it was demonstrated in other studies in the bovine species [10, 11] , the use of IFA as adjuvant was satisfactory to induce a significant humoral immune response following systemic immunization with bovine rotavirus. The increased antibody formation that generally follows the inoculation of the antigen incorporated into a water-in-oil emulsion is recognized to be associated with the antigen-depot effect as a means of greater persistence of the antigen in vivo, thus extending the period of antigenic stimulation, and to the attraction of immunocompetent cells to the area of injection [30] .",

For rotavirus infection, it has been demonstrated that optimal CMI as measured by LST with splenic lymphocytes correlates with the end of virus replication in the intestine and follows the termination of diarrhea in young infected mice [31] . Another report [32] showed that delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) elicited by subcutaneous inoculation of murine rotavirus was observed in neonatal (12-day old) and adult (> 30-day old) mice respectively 21 and 7 to 10 days following rotavirus infection orally. This DTH response was however not seen in neonatal mice when infected at 5 days of age. Another study [33] has reported the ability of simian rotavirus-stimulated human peripheral blood leukocytes to produce interferon and cytokines, which stimulated the killing in vitro of rotavirus-infected cells by a second set of leukocytes described as natural killer cells. As reported in this study, immunization of calves with adjuvanted bovine rotavirus induced an in vitro specific proliferative activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, the role of these lymphocytes sensitized to bovine rotavirus remains to be determined.",
