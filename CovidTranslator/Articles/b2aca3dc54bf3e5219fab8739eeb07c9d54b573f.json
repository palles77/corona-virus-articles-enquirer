Among surface expressed polypeptides is the 35-kDa antigen, previously designated Ag35 . Both monoclonal (mAb) and monospecific affinity pure antibodies directed against Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness, indicating that this prominent surface antigen has a function during early virus-host cell interactions . The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to various regions of Ag35 was tested by reacting CNBr fragments, derived from the polypeptide, employing Western blotting . All mAbs tested reacted with the same region of Ag35 . Estimation of the molecular weights (MW), based on migration of the CNBr peptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that those partial digestion products which contained a proline-rich 99 amino acid limit digest fragment were present at a position approximately 12 .5 kDa larger than that predicted from the DNA sequence . By contrast, partial and limit digest products lacking the praline-rich fragment migrated to the MW position expected from the length of the DNA sequence . This observation demonstrates that departure from a predicted 22 .3 kDa to an anomalous MW of Ag35 is conferred by the proline-rich peptide . The surface location of Ag35 was confirmed by immune electron microscopy. In a competition test the binding specificity of mAb and affinity-purified antibodies at the surface of virions could be demonstrated . Evidence for an association of Ag35 with the virus envelope at various stages during biogenesis of vaccinia was obtained by immune electron microscopy of whole mounts and thin sections. Presence of Ag35 as an early component of immature and mature virions, probably residing in the bilayer membrane structure was detected . A distinction can, therefore, be made between Ag35 and several other vaccinia envelope polypeptides which are synthesized as late functions and added during late stages of envelope assembly . x 1ss1 Academic Press, Inc .",

            "text": "The orthopoxviruses as exemplified by vacciniavirus have been subjected to intensive study because they possess great structural and functional complexity, follow a unique scheme of replication, and are versatile as recombinant vectors for transfer of foreign genes into animal cells (Dales and Pogo, 1981 ; Fenner stall 1989 ; Panicali et al., 1983 ; Smith et all 1983) . Orthopoxvirus replication is confined to the cytoplasm of host cells mandating the encoding by the virus of a large spectrum of enzymatic activities to initiate uncoating and transcriptional events (Reviewed in Dales and Pogo, 1981 ; Fenneretal ., 1989) . The morphogenesis of vaccinia can be subdivided into a temporally regulated series of stages . One particular area of interest in this laboratory has been the biogenesis of the vaccinia viral envelope which occurs through a unique de novo mechanism within the viroplasmic matrix also termed \"factory .\" We define as the envelope the membraneous lipoprotein tegument which encloses the virion (Dales and Pogo, 1981) . Unlike the situation with 2 Supported by the Medical Research Council of Canada . Recipient of an Ontario Graduate Scholarship . 671 other membrane-enclosed eukaryotic viruses, formation of the vaccinia envelope is not connected with preexisting cellular membranes (Dales and Mosbach, 1968 ) . The first step in envelope assembly evident by electron microscopy is the appearance of curved segments consisting of a unit membrane configuration backed by an external layer of spicules, which provide rigidity and confer spherical shape to the immature form of the virion (Dales and Mosbach, 1968) . The early stages of envelope formation can occur normally in the absence of viral DNA synthesis, which may be blocked by inhibitors such as hydroxyurea (HU) (Pogo and Dales, 1971) . During normal morphogenesis, when DNA synthesis is allowed to occur, nucleoprotein complexes are packaged within the envelopes and then become differentiated into characteristic biconcave cores and associated lateral bodies . At a late stage during maturation the virus surface is modified by exchange of the spicule layer for a coating of surface tubular elements (STE) (Stern and Dales, 1 976a ; Essani et al., 1982) .",

The foreign polypeptides expressed by such recombinants are compartmentalized within the cell according to signal sequences encoded by the gene inserted but do not become part of the virion .

Briefly, an NP-40 extract from purified virus was prepared as described (Wilton et at, 1986) and separated by preparative SDS-PAGE using a full-width comb . Following electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and the band correspond-ing to Ag35 was localized by staining with amido black and excised from the nitrocellulose sheet . The excised strip was cut into small pieces and transferred to the barrel of a 5-ml syringe . All subsequent steps were carried out by drawing 1 ml of the appropriate buffer into the syringe through an 18-g needle and mixing gently . The nitrocellulose was blocked by treating with phosphate-buffered saline + 0 .05% Tween 20 (PBS-Tw) containing 3% casein for 4 hr at 24\u00b0. Nitrocellulose pieces were washed extensively with PBS-Tw (six to eight washes) then reacted with the antiserum overnight at 4\u00b0. Once again the pieces were washed extensively with PBS-Tw .

The biotinylated virus surface polypeptides were separated in the same manner. Extraction with 196 NP-40 released the bulk of the 35-and 31-kDa polypeptides into the detergent phase (Fig . 1A , lane 2) leaving behind the 58-and 22-kDa biotinylated polypeptides with the NP-40 insoluble pellet (Fig . 1A, lane 3) . The 39-kDa antigen was about equally abundant in the NP-40 soluble and insoluble fractions . After extraction of virions with NP-40 and 125 mM 2-ME, the envelopes disappeared leaving behind cores with attached lateral bodies (See Fig . 6D ) . In this preparation the 58-, 35-, 31-, and 22-kDa polypeptides, appeared in the soluble fraction (Fig . 1A, lane 4) . The 31-kDa polypeptide released by NP-40 alone should not be confused with a similarly migrating 32-kDa polypeptide described previously (Wilton et at, 1986) . The latter was not synthesized by the IHD-W strain of vaccinia used in the current study but was present when the IHD-J strain was reacted with NHSbiotin (data not shown), indicating that the 32-kDa polypeptide is also a surface exposed component . One should note the faint signals of 60-, 24-, and 23-kDa biotinylated polypeptides which remained with the viral cores (Fig . 1A , lane 5) . Slight biotinylation of these highly abundant core polypeptides (Dales and Pogo, 1981) could have been due to presence of a minor fraction of damaged virions in the purified suspensions .",

Distribution of Ag35 between detergent soluble and insoluble fractions, detected by immunoblotting ( Fig . 1 B) was identical to that revealed by the biotinylated polypeptides . More efficient solubilization of Ag35 achieved here, as compared to that reported by us previously (Wilton et a!, 1986) was probably due to carrying out the extraction at a pH 8 .3 rather than 7 .3 and use as starting material of a lower concentration (250 \u00b5g/ml not 1 mg/ml) of virus protein . Among minor components observed by Western blotting employing these polyvalent antibodies was an antigen migrating faster than Ag35 (Fig . 1B) , which comigrated with a biotinylated polypeptide (Fig . 1A) and a second antigen, above Ag35 which did not have a biotinylated counterpart .",

To define the antigen further affinity purified rabbit antibodies were prepared, as described under Materials and Methods . Specificity of these antibodies is evident in immunoblotting analysis, illustrated in Fig . 2 , where only a single prominent band at 35-kDa is evident . To obtain an approximate estimate on the amount of monospecific antibodies after affinity purification, in relation to the starting material, serial dilutions of the original rabbit antiserum were reacted with standard amounts of vaccinia antigen and compared with the affinity-purified antibodies (Fig . 2) . It should be noted that a very weak additional band at a higher MW position is also evident in the lane corresponding to reaction with purified and nonpurified antibodies . The minor antigenic component may result from retardation in the electrophoretic field due to an unreduced dimer or a contaminant associated with Ag35 because following excision from the gel and reelectrophoresis, this antigen migrated to the 35-kDa position (data not shown) . As described below, similar observations were made with MAb against Ag35 .",

Either PBS alone or varying dilutions of antisera in PBS were incubated in a 40 \u00b5l reaction volume at 37\u00b0 for 1 hr with a standard number of PFUs of vaccinia virus . Then the virus-antibody complexes were diluted and assayed on L cell monolayers . Open squares, antiserum to NP-40 extract ; closed squares, prelmmune rabbit serum ; open circles, affinity-purified monospecific antibodies ; closed circle, control in PBS, monospecific antibodies were tested in a neutralization assay . For comparison we also used the serum directed against the NP-40 extracted virion components . As evident from plaque reduction data seen in Fig . 3 , at an optimum dilution the polyvalent serum decreased vaccinia virus infectivity approximately 400fold, and the affinity-purified serum by about 10-fold . Preimmune control rabbit serum had no significant effect on infectivity . As described above in Fig . 2 , the level of reactivity specific for Ag35 was also evaluated by Western blotting . Assessment of the comparative antibody reactivity is based on affinity for SDS-denatured Ag35 antigen . From these data we estimated that the reactivity of 20 pl of the affinity-purified antibodies corresponded approximately to that obtained with 5 ul of the polyvalent antiserum, suggesting that reactivity of purified anti-Ag35 antibodies could be severalfold higher than actually observed by the neutralization assay . This still made them less efficient than the polyvalent serum . Loss of potency may occur because the affinity purification procedure relied on immobilization of antigen on Western blots . Therefore, the antibodies released after binding must have been primarily against linear epitopes, rather than some additional, conformational epitopes, possessing perhaps greater significance for neutralization of infectiousness . A second and more important consideration is the presence in the serum, directed against the entire NP-40 extract, of antibodies to a spectrum of antigens interacting with the host cell surface, including the important 14-kDa polypeptide described by Rodriguez et al. (1985) .",

The 35-kDa polypeptide could be broken selectively into a few fragments by CNBr because in the amino acid sequence only three internal methionines are available for cleavage . The fragments derived from CNBrdigestion of purified Ag35, as described in Materials and Methods, were resolved by PAGE separation . A graphic presentation showing the location of N-terminal and internal methionines, as predicted from sequence of Ag35 (Gordon et al., 1988) and the possible peptides which can be derived therefrom, is provided in Fig . 5B . This should be compared with the actual peptides resolved by PAGE and stained by Coomassie blue (Fig . 5A) and binding mAbs as revealed by immunoblotting (Fig . 5C ) . Due to the anomalous migration of Ag35 which, based on the sequence data, should be 22 .3 kDa rather than 35 kDa (Gordon et al., 1988) it is not possible to predict the exact MWs for individual peptides obtained by CNBr cleavage . However, it is possible to relate the diminution in MW as a consequence of the removal of one or more fragments . It is evident from data in Table  1 that for CNBrfragments CB6, CB7, and CB8 the MW obtained from the gel (Fig . 5A) , matches closely that predicted from the sequence . For the intact Ag35 and CB 1-5 fragments the apparent MWs in Fig . 5A and Table 2 are about 12-13 kDa greater than predicted from the sequence . Therefore, the anomalous migration in PAGE must be due to a sequence motif residing in the limit digest peptide CBS, as this represents the only fragment common to all peptides showing the anomalous migration . A prominent 20-kDa band in Fig .  5A could be a cleavage or degradation product of one of the larger fragments .",

Primary application of the rabbit antibodies decreased by a factor of 2 the number of gold particles identifying mAb 7C\" (Table 3) . However, to achieve this degree of competition it required the use of high concentrations of the rabbit antibodies, implying that mAbwas present in excess . This was confirmed by competition experiments employing for primary binding a constant amount of the rabbit antibodies followed by a range of dilutions of mAb 7C\" . This procedure resulted in effective competition against 7C, when 250 ng/\u00b5l of rabbit antibodies were used to compete with 12 .5 ng/ \u00b5l or 25 ng/\u00b5l of mAb, as shown by the data in Table 4 . Competition between the same constant amount of rabbit antibodies and 50 ng/ul of mAb reduced binding by approximately 500/0, a value similar to that obtained when rabbit primary antibodies were 500 ng/ul and mAb at 300 ng/pl (see Table 3 ) .

Although permeation of individual cells in cultures by means of saponin was highly variable, examples were found in which tagging of mAb 7C t1 or the monospecific rabbit antibodies by gold-antibody conjugates was adequate to demonstrate in thin sections the specificity of binding to immature forms of vaccinia . In one example of virus-infected cells sampled 12 hr after inoculation, numerous immature virions labeled by gold particles were evident in the cytoplasm (Figs . 7A and 7B) . Intermediates in envelope assembly possessing the characteristic rigid, spiculebacked hemispherical conformation were also specifically labeled, as evident in the examples shown in Figs . 713 and 7C . Reactivity with Ag35 was frequently evident at the free ends of segments of envelope, where the spicule-backed membrane structures are terminated, suggesting that specific antibodies became attached to the bilayer structure of envelopes (Fig . 7C) . It is quite possible that an external layer of spicules, described in detail previously (Essani, et al., 1982) was a hindrance to the ready access of antibodies to the subjacent bilayer . Very few gold particles were present within the nonmembraneous viroplasmic matrix material . The specificity of antigen-antibody interaction was shown by absence of gold particles when mAb directed against the variable surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma bruceii (A gift of Dr . M . W .

Not surprisingly, the polyvalent affinity-purified antibodies could diminish infectiousness more efficiently, to approximately 1/10 the original value, than the mAbs since the affinity-purified serum would be likely to react with more than one epitope on the polypeptide . Neutralization observed with the polyclonal anti-envelope serum was much more effective than with the monospecific antibodies indicating that in suppression of infectiousness several polypeptide antigens are probably participants . The relatively low efficiency in plaque reduction tests of monospecific rabbit antibodies against Ag35 is in keeping with neutralization data obtained using antibodies against other vaccinia envelope polypeptides (Rodriguez at at, 1985) and may be the consequence of a very large surface area and antigenic complexity of this virus . In addition, inefficient neutralization by mAb and monospecific antibodies may indicate that several polypeptides play a role at the initial stage of the infection .",

Although vaccinia virions contain two or more glycoproteins, none are present in the envelope (Holowczak, 1970 ; Garon and Moss, 1971) . The absence of envelope glycoproteins in vaccinia, in contrast with other enveloped viruses, is the consequence of synthesis of envelope proteins in the cytosol rather than on the endoplasmic reticulum .

The latter model fits the association of myelin basic protein with myelin membranes (Mendz et al., 1990) . One interesting characteristic of Ag35 is its anomalous migration by SDS-PAGE . Although the polypeptide migrates to a position corresponding to 35 kDa, the open reading frame (ORF) encoding Ag35 is sufficient to encode a polypeptide of only 22 .3 kDa . This discrepancy was anticipated by Rosel etaL (1986) from the length of the ORF for HeR . The inconsistency cannot be due to post-translational modification of the polypeptide since the ORF when linked to a prokaryotic promoter and expressed in E. col/yielded a polypeptide that retained the anomalous migration . When examining the behavior of CNBr cleavage products of Ag35, in SDS-PAGE it became clear that fragments containing the peptide CBS, corresponding to a unit peptide spanning the region between methionines at residues 18 El AEIRAHLKNSA and 116 in the predicted amino acid sequence (see Fig . 9 ), were found at positions 12-13 kDa larger than anticipated from the DNA sequence, while peptides which do not contain this fragment were positioned correctly, according to their predicted MW . Within C85 is a stretch of 22 amino acids, residues 39-60, in which 5 prolines occur, consistent with the explanation we have suggested (Gordon et al., 1988) , as the cause of the anomalous MW of this polypeptide in SDS-PAGE .",
