In murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the spike (S) protein mediates this process. Recently, the formation of anti-parallel 6-helix bundle of the MHV S protein heptad repeat (HR) regions (HR1 and HR2) has been conWrmed, implying coronavirus has a class I fusion protein. This bundle is also called fusion core. To facilitate the solution of the crystal structure of this fusion core, we deployed an Escherichia coli in vitro expression system to express the HR1 and HR2 regions linked together by a Xexible linker as a single chain (named 2-helix). This 2-helix polypeptide subsequently assembled into a typical 6-helix bundle. This bundle has been analyzed by a series of biophysical and biochemical techniques and conWrmed that the design technique can be used for coronavirus as we successfully used for members of paramyxoviruses. \uf6d9 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In humans and fowl, coronaviruses primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections, while porcine and bovine coronaviruses establish enteric infections that result in severe economic loss [4] . The emergence of atyp-ical pneumonia with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and identiWcation of the etiologic agent as a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have attracted the attention of the scientists and ordinary people for the importance of the family Coronaviridae [5, 6] .",

This process is mediated by viral envelope spike (S) protein, which is thought to be a trimer on the virion. The MHV S protein is cleaved in the Golgi apparatus, by a host cell protease, into two similarly sized subunits: amino terminal S1 and carboxyl terminal S2. It is believed that the S1 subunit forms the globular head of the spike, whereas the S2 subunit forms the transmembrane stalk portion [8] . Sequence analysis suggests that the coronavirus spike protein has the structural features of a type I membrane protein, including a transmembrane domain near the carboxyl terminus of S2 and a hydrophobic signal peptide at the N-terminus of S1.",

It has a fusion peptide at the amino terminus that is thought to insert directly into the target membrane during the viral fusion process [12] . Carboxyl-terminal to the fusion peptide are two regions containing 4,3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeats, sequence motifs, which form a coiled-coil structure in the postfusion state after series of the conformational changes of the fusion protein [12] . This coiled-coil structure is a stable, protease resistant core in the ectodomain of enveloped glycoprotein (or fusion protein), named as viral fusion core [12] . The fusion core complex consists of trimer of HR1/HR2 heterodimers, therefore, it is also called 6-helix bundle. The MHV fusion core complex has been conWrmed biophysically and biochemically [14] but its crystal structure is yet to be elucidated. We previously developed a method to prepare this core complex for other viruses [15] [16] [17] by linking the HR1 and HR2 as a single chain. It was shown to be an eVective method to prepare diVractable crystals for such a core complex.",

In comparison, the computed molecular mass of 2-helix (with 6\u00a3 Histidine) is about 13 kDa, which indicates that the 2-helix might form oligomers (about 40 kDa). MALDI-TOFF results showed that the 2-helix monomer is about 12.6 kDa with two possible charges (Fig. 4A) . Subsequently, chemical cross-linking demonstrated that the 2-helix protein oligomer was, in fact, a trimer (Fig. 5) from the estimated molecular mass of the cross-linked products. In addition, the content of trimer increased with the concentration increase of the chemical cross-linker. Clear trimer band with monomer could also be seen if the samples (reduced by SDS loading buVer) were not heated at 100\u00b0C (Lane 2 in Fig. 5A ).

Moreover, it seems that the start-codon ATG-encoded methionine remains in the expressed 2-helix protein as the molecular increase between the native and SeMet derivative indicates that three methionines were replaced by SeMet (molecular mass increases by 3 \u00a3 (79 \u00a1 32) D 141 Da).
