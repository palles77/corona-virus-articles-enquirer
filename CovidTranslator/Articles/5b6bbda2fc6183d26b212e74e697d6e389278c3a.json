            "text": "The effect of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and methylcellulose (Methocel \u00ae 60 HG) on the dissolution behavior of two cocrystals derived from nitazoxanide (NTZ), viz., nitazoxanide-glutaric acid (NTZ-GLU, 1:1) and nitazoxanide-succinic acid (NTZ-SUC, 2:1), was explored. Powder dissolution experiments under non-sink conditions showed similar dissolution profiles for the cocrystals and pure NTZ. However, pre-dissolved cellulosic polymer in the phosphate dissolution medium (pH 7.5) modified the dissolution profile of NTZ when starting from the cocrystals, achieving transient drug supersaturation. Subsequent dissolution studies under sink conditions of polymer-based pharmaceutical powder formulations with NTZ-SUC cocrystals gave a significant improvement of the apparent solubility of NTZ when compared with analogous formulations of pure NTZ and the physical mixture of NTZ and SUC. Scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction analysis of samples recovered after the powder dissolution studies showed that the cocrystals undergo fast dissolution, drug supersaturation and precipitation both in the absence and presence of polymer, suggesting that the solubilization enhancement is due to polymer-induced delay of nucleation and crystal growth of the less soluble NTZ form. The study demonstrates that the incorporation of an appropriate excipient in adequate concentration can be a key factor for inducing and maintaining the solubilization of poorly soluble drugs starting from co-crystallized solid forms. In such a way, cocrystals can be suitable for the development of solid dosage forms with improved bioavailability and efficacy in the treatment of important parasitic and viral diseases, among others.",

If at least one of the components is an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and if the coformer is pharmaceutically acceptable, then the substance is recognized as pharmaceutical cocrystal. A pharmaceutical cocrystal can offer multiple benefits for physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of APIs, such as increased solubility and dissolution rates, improvement of mechanical properties, and stability [13] [14] [15] . Particularly, cocrystals have exhibited higher, similar or lower solubility compared to the parent API, depending on the nature of the coformer and the solution conditions [16, 17] . Solubility advantages of cocrystals over parent drugs can be higher by orders of magnitude, however, this also represents a risk due to precipitation to the less soluble form of the drug at supersaturated concentrations reached during the dissolution process [18, 19] .",

A strategy to control cocrystal dissolution, drug supersaturation and precipitation is the use of supersaturated formulations, which incorporates additives and excipients such as cyclodextrins, surfactants and polymers [22] . In such systems, the supersaturation state must be maintained over a reasonable time period in order to promote adequate absorption for increased bioavailability. In this line, there are several recent reports on the effect of polymers and surfactants in increasing solubility and dissolution rates of poorly soluble drugs, starting from a cocrystalline solid phase. Some representative APIs and nutraceutical compounds studied under this approach are celecoxib [23] , danazol [24] , indomethacin [25] , carbamazepine [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , flufenamic acid [32] , cilostazol [33] , resveratrol [34] , dihydromyricetin [35] , tadalafil [36] , exemestane [37] and posaconazole [38] .",

In both publications, improved intrinsic dissolution rates were documented, showing that NTZ cocrystals can improve the solubilization of NTZ in physiologically relevant media [8] , thus being good candidates for the future development of novel dosage forms. Herein, two cocrystals, viz., NTZ-GLU and NTZ-SUC (GLU = glutaric acid; SUC = succinic acid), were chosen to evaluate the effect of two cellulosic polymers, namely hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and methylcellulose (Methocel \u00ae 60 HG) (Scheme 1), on the dissolution performance of the API, in comparison with pure NTZ, a commercially available NTZ medicine and the respective physical mixtures of NTZ and the coformer. Our study includes an API widely used in treatments concerning tropical neglected diseases, even though scarcely studied [45] . The purpose of this work was to study the behavior of NTZ cocrystals in solution and the conditions to sustain supersaturation levels since these conditions cannot be apparent and must be studied case-by-case. Given its therapeutic relevance, approaches to formulate nitazoxanide cocrystals will be of benefit to improve its efficacy, considering that its low solubility impacts its bioavailability. Importantly, nitazoxanide has been proposed as a potential agent for public health control [46] .",

NTZ-SUC and NTZ-GLU cocrystals were prepared in scales of 1.0 g, and in all cases a homogeneous single phase was obtained, for which the experimental PXRD pattern agreed with the pattern simulated from the crystal structure determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (see Figure S4 ). A batch of ten (individually characterized) samples was finally mixed and used for all subsequent experiments. Figure 1 shows the effect of polymers commonly employed in pharmaceutical drug formulations to inhibiting or delaying precipitation of NTZ. In the absence of polymers, addition of aliquots from NTZ stock solution (25 mg/mL) to 3 mL of a phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.5) caused precipitation of NTZ at concentrations above 0.30 mg/mL. In the presence of 0.5% w/v pre-dissolved cellulosic polymers, i.e., Methocel \u00ae MC, Methocel \u00ae 60 HG, HMPC, HPC 80,000 and HPC 370,000, as well as the polyvinylpyrrolidone Kollidon \u00ae 25, precipitation of NTZ was inhibited, reaching concentrations of at least 1.0 mg/mL; meanwhile, polyethylene glycol Kollisolv \u00ae and poloxamer Kolliphor \u00ae P 407 maintained the drug dissolved only at concentrations below 0.25-0.40 mg/mL. Based on these results, HPMC and Methocel \u00ae 60 HG were selected for subsequent powder dissolution experiments of NTZ and the cocrystal phases with GLU and SUC under non-sink conditions.

Although the graph associated to NTZ-SUC exhibits a larger increase, the statistical difference (p > 0.05) between the dissociation rates is not significant due to the relatively large standard deviation (Figure 6b ).

The AUC is directly and inversely proportional to the dissolution and precipitation rates, respectively [49] . Figure 7 shows that unformulated NTZ-SUC cocrystals and NTZ-SUC formulated with 1.0% w/w Methocel \u00ae 60 HG do not lead to improved dissolution profiles when compared to NTZ and the Figure 6a illustrates the dissolution profiles measured over a time interval of 3 h of the unformulated (0.0% w/w of Methocel \u00ae 60 HG) solid phases of pure NTZ, the physical mixture with SUC and the NTZ-SUC cocrystal. The drug dissolution profiles are similar (p > 0.05), achieving approximately 8 mg of dissolved drug (ca. 3% in relation to 250 mg of NTZ dose). In contrast, when the solid phases were formulated with 1.0% Methocel \u00ae 60 HG, the drug was dissolved in significantly larger amounts, either starting from the pure form, the physical mixture or the cocrystal (~17-27 mg of drug dissolved after 3 h). Although the graph associated to NTZ-SUC exhibits a larger increase, the statistical difference (p > 0.05) between the dissociation rates is not significant due to the relatively large standard deviation (Figure 6b ). However, with larger amounts of Methocel \u00ae 60 HG polymer (2.5 and 5.0%), the NTZ-SUC cocrystal gave a significantly improved dissolution profile (p < 0.05) when compared to analogous formulations of pure NTZ and the physical mixture, achieving after 3 h, amounts of 42 and 45 mg of NTZ dissolved (Figure 6c,d) . Furthermore, for the formulation of the cocrystal with 5% Methocel \u00ae 60 HG, the amount of NTZ dissolved after 2 min was already approximately 12 mg (Figure 6d ), which is significantly larger than the final amount achieved by the corresponding unformulated solid phases (Figure 6a) .",

            "text": "In the research project presented herein, two cellulosic polymers were chosen to evaluate their effect on maintaining the supersaturated state achieved during the dissolution of cocrystalline solid phases of nitazoxanide, a poorly soluble drug. Subsequently, polymer-cocrystal powder formulations were developed. To select adequate candidates from the series of widely used polymers in the pharmaceutical industry that delay the nucleation and/or crystallization of NTZ in supersaturated conditions, the solvent-shift approach was used [24] , see Figure S1 . Figure 1 demonstrates the results with the polymers tested for NTZ in pH 7.5 PBS at room temperature, finding that non-cellulosic polymers (Kollisolv \u00ae and Kolliphor \u00ae P407) do not significantly help in delaying NTZ precipitation, while polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-Kollidon \u00ae 25) and cellulosic polymers (HPC 80,000, HPC 370,000, HPMC, Methocel \u00ae MC and Methocel \u00ae 60 HG) enable the increase of the concentration of NTZ in aqueous solution up to at least 1.0 mg/mL. Considering the hydrogen bonding capacity, NTZ has one H-bond donor group (NH) and four H-bond acceptor sites [8] . As can be observed in Scheme 1, the cellulosic polymers HPMC and Methocel \u00ae 60 HG contain a large number of O-H donor groups, which are complementary for the formation of hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond acceptors, explaining the good precipitation inhibitor properties for NTZ. The remaining polymers tested herein lack strong H-bond donor functions that could interact through hydrogen bonds with NTZ. These findings are supported by previous reports in the literature, e.g., in 2010, Warren et al. described the effectiveness of cellulosic polymers as crystallization inhibitors for danazol [52] . Other reports showed that HPMC reduces efficiently the nucleation and crystal growth of felodipine [53] and celecoxib [54] under non-sink conditions. Moreover, it is reasonable to Figure 10 .

At the same time, in the last few years the number of publications and patents related to pharmaceutical cocrystals has been increasing [50, 51] . Nevertheless, there are still several challenges for the development of cocrystals in pharmaceutical solid dosage forms, particularly in controlling the behavior of cocrystal dissolution, drug supersaturation and precipitation kinetics, which can be achieved by selecting suitable excipients that will delay nucleation and/or crystallization, and maintain adequate drug supersaturation levels [13, 51] .",

Subsequently, polymer-cocrystal powder formulations were developed. To select adequate candidates from the series of widely used polymers in the pharmaceutical industry that delay the nucleation and/or crystallization of NTZ in supersaturated conditions, the solvent-shift approach was used [24] , see Figure S1 . Figure 1 demonstrates the results with the polymers tested for NTZ in pH 7.5 PBS at room temperature, finding that non-cellulosic polymers (Kollisolv \u00ae and Kolliphor \u00ae P407) do not significantly help in delaying NTZ precipitation, while polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-Kollidon \u00ae 25) and cellulosic polymers (HPC 80,000, HPC 370,000, HPMC, Methocel \u00ae MC and Methocel \u00ae 60 HG) enable the increase of the concentration of NTZ in aqueous solution up to at least 1.0 mg/mL. Considering the hydrogen bonding capacity, NTZ has one H-bond donor group (NH) and four H-bond acceptor sites [8] . As can be observed in Scheme 1, the cellulosic polymers HPMC and Methocel \u00ae 60 HG contain a large number of O-H donor groups, which are complementary for the formation of hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond acceptors, explaining the good precipitation inhibitor properties for NTZ. The remaining polymers tested herein lack strong H-bond donor functions that could interact through hydrogen bonds with NTZ. These findings are supported by previous reports in the literature, e.g., in 2010, Warren et al. described the effectiveness of cellulosic polymers as crystallization inhibitors for danazol [52] . Other reports showed that HPMC reduces efficiently the nucleation and crystal growth of felodipine [53] and celecoxib [54] under non-sink conditions. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that cellulose derivatives do inhibit, not only nucleation but also crystal growth and agglomeration into larger sized particles (see SEM results) that otherwise may form from during NTZ precipitation. In other words, the precipitation delay of NTZ can also be attributed to surface interactions between the NTZ particles and the polymer, forming drug-polymer complexes, which is derived in the modification of the NTZ solubilization properties.",

            "text": "Based on the large solubility difference between NTZ and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids as coformers [8] , we expected that cocrystal forms of NTZ with GLU and SUC increase the aqueous solubility of NTZ. Figure 2a shows that NTZ-GLU and NTZ-SUC cocrystals have dissolution profiles similar to NTZ in pH 7.5 phosphate buffer solution, and a higher solubilization of NTZ is not observed under these conditions. Indeed, rapid conversion of the cocrystals into pure drug was demonstrated by PXRD analysis of the solids recovered after the dissolution tests in short time periods (~1-5 min, Figure 3) . A similar behavior has been documented for other cocrystal phases in the literature [24, 25, 30, 36, 37, [55] [56] [57] . For example, exemestane-maleic-acid cocrystals did not increase solubilization of the drug due to rapid phase transformation [55] . In a recent publication this cocrystal was reinvestigated observing that transformation into the parent drug occurred in less than 1 min in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) [37] . The critical role of the coformer physicochemical properties on the solubility and dissolution advantages of cocrystals it is now accepted, even though the exact mechanism by which this enhancement occurs is not fully understood. In NTZ cocrystals studied here, the coformers GLU and SUC are ionizable compounds (pK a values of 4.3 for GLU and 4.2 for SUC) and exhibit favorable water solubilities of 540 mg/mL and 71 mg/mL at 25 \u2022 C, respectively [12, 58] . The fast dissolution-supersaturation phenomenon induced for the NTZ cocrystals under the experimental conditions used herein (pH 7.5 PBS), is attributed to the favorable solubilization of these coformers. This rapid cocrystal dissolution produces drug supersaturation levels that are difficult to control in absence of suitable excipients at adequate concentrations, and therefore NTZ solubilization advantage was not observed.",

An addition of a cellulosic polymer into the dissolution medium for powder dissolution studies under non-sink conditions revealed that these can induce a supersaturation effect starting from NTZ-SUC and NTZ-GLU cocrystals. Both Methocel \u00ae 60 HG and HPMC were able to maintain drug supersaturation (up to 4 times higher concentrations of NTZ in solution over solubility value) for a period long enough to display a superior dissolution profile (Figure 2b,c) . The phenomenon was upheld for up to 30 min, emulating the spring-parachute effect [48] . There are some studies demonstrating an in vitro/in vivo correlation of formulated cocrystals. In these cases, the in vitro dissolution test showed that the high drug concentration achieved by cocrystalline phases is maintained by 30-40 min and the bioavailability of the corresponding poorly soluble drugs was enhanced [24, 33] . Considering these experimental data, it is considered that the increase of NTZ dissolved from NTZ cocrystals formulated with polymers may promote NTZ absorption.",

Therefore, the improvement of the NTZ dissolution profiles in the presence of pre-dissolved polymer could be explained by the following mechanism: after the rapid NTZ release into solution starting from the cocrystal, the cellulosic polymer interacts with NTZ molecules delaying its nucleation and eventually NTZ crystallized also interact with polymer interfering the crystal growth and agglomeration process.",

However, there are few studies which have tested the effect of a polymer incorporated in the powder solid-state form on the dissolution profiles of cocrystals [23] . In order to evaluate the effect of Methocel \u00ae 60 HG on the dissolution process of NTZ-SUC cocrystals starting from a solid polymer-cocrystal formulation, we examined a series of pharmaceutical powder-based formulations containing different amounts of Methocel \u00ae 60 HG (0.0, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0% w/w) in comparison to analogous forms with pure NTZ and the physical mixture of NTZ and SUC. In the absence of polymer, all solid phases released similar amounts of NTZ into the solution during the powder dissolution studies using the USP 1 apparatus (Figure 6a ) and the NTZ-SUC cocrystal did not show a solubility advantage in comparison with the pure drug and the physical mixture. This observation can be attributed to immediate conversion of the cocrystal phase into NTZ and release of SUC into the solution, in accordance with the dissolution experiments under non-sink conditions. Formulations of pure NTZ, the physical mixture with SUC, and NTZ-SUC cocrystals with 1% (w/w) of Methocel \u00ae 60 HG showed dissolution profiles being similar among each other, but at higher concentrations, i.e., 2.5 and 5.0% (w/w), a significant increase of the dissolution rate was observed (Figure 6c ,d and Figure 7) .",

The polymer-NTZ interactions probably influence the nucleation process and subsequent crystal growth/agglomeration, thus giving high drug concentration in the dissolution medium over a prolonged time period.
