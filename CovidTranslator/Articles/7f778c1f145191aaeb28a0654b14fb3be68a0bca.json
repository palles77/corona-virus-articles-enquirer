However, rAAV-based vaccines have been suggested to trigger functionally impaired long-term memory CD8 + T cell responses, in part due to poor dendritic cell (DC) transduction. Such results, albeit limited to intramuscular immunization, undermined the use of rAAV as vaccine vehicles against intracellular pathogens. We report here that intradermal immunization with a model rAAV2/1-based vaccine drives the development of bona fide long-term memory CD8 + T cell responses. The intradermal route of immunization and the presence of potent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II responses showed synergistic effects on the overall quantity and quality of systemic long-term effector memory transgene-specific CD8 + T cells being generated against the transgene. Of key interest, we found that the induction of memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) following intradermal immunization was solely dependent on the cross-presentation of skin-expressed transgene products, which appeared highly enhanced as compared to muscle-expressed transgene products. Overall our results highlight key tissue-specific differences in transgene presentation pathway requirements of importance for the design of rAAV-based T cell-inducing vaccines.",

Experiments conducted in various animal models have confirmed the ability of rAAV to drive sustained protective humoral immunity through a variety of injection routes. 6 However, reports of function-ally impaired memory CD8 + T cell responses induced following intramuscular immunization led to the current paradigm that rAAV vectors are poorly suited for the induction of cellular immunity, 7, 8 a key requirement for protective immunity against intracellular pathogens.",

We previously described, in the context of intramuscular immunization, that this rAAV2/1 construct induces strong OVA 257 -specific CD8 + T cell and DBY 608 -specific CD4 + T cell responses in female mice. 9 In male mice, who are naturally tolerant to male antigens, the DBY 608 -specific CD4 + T cell response is absent, 27 while the OVA 257 -specific CD8 + T cell response is curtailed and strongly dependent on transgene expression in hematopoietic cells. 9 Of importance, male mice respond similarly to CD4-depleted female mice in this setting, 9 and the MHC class II-restricted OVA 323 epitope does not lead to detectable CD4 + T cell response.",

In contrast, similar CD8 + T cell responses were observed for both constructs following intradermal immunization in male mice, with only a mild reduction in the intensity of the response at day 14. These results suggested that direct priming by DCs is dispensable for the induction of strong CD8 + T cell responses following skin targeting with rAAV2/1 vectors. In the context of intramuscular immunization, however, efficient cross-priming of transgene-specific CTLs with tissue-expressed transgene products was only seen in the presence of a concomitant DBY 608 -specific helper T cell response ( Figure 4C ). Importantly, we also observed that potent generation of all memory subsets following immunization with our miR142-3p-regulated construct appeared to follow the same rules as seen with the wild-type mOVA-HY construct.

Protective immunity against this model pathogen has been shown to rely mostly on Lmspecific CTLs. 33 Female mice previously immunized with a control rAAV2/1 vector gradually lost weight up to day 3 post-infection ( Figure 5E ), at which time point the mice being analyzed harbored up to 10 8 CFUs of Lm-OVA in the spleen, in line with the known kinetic of pathogenesis associated with Lm infection. 34 In contrast, intradermal cross-priming induced by a single rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR immunization was sufficient to achieve clear protection, with weight loss curtailed by day 2 ( Figure 5E ) and complete clearance of the bacterial load by day 3 in 90% of analyzed female mice. Infection was also controlled in rAAV2/1-mOVA-HY-miR-immunized male mice ( Figure 5E ), both intradermal and intramuscular, but weight loss was only curtailed by day 3, and incomplete bacterial clearance could be observed in 30% of intramuscularly immunized male mice at this time point.

The addition of miR142-3p target sequences to the construct led to a reduced and delayed presentation of OVA 257 following intramuscular immunization ( Figure 7A ), in line with the observed reduction in DC presentation and in the primary CD8 + T cell responses (Figures 4B and 6E) . CD4 + T cell help only had a limited impact on the presentation of the miR142-3p-regulated transgene ( Figure 7B ). Interestingly, robust activation of transferred OT-1 was already detected by day 5 following intradermal immunization with the miR142-3p-regulated mOVA-HY construct and to levels continuously higher than in the intramuscular control group up to day 9 ( Figure 7C ). As this could simply reflect a quantitative effect rather than a qualitative difference with respect to the contribution of the cross-presentation pathway following skin delivery, we further analyzed OVA 257 presentation following intradermal immunization using lower doses of both wild-type and miR142-3p-regulated mOVA-HY constructs. In contrast to the striking difference in OVA 257 presentation observed at day 5 between both constructs following immunization in the muscle at the highest dose ( Figure 7A ), MHC class I presentation of skin-targeted OVA transgene was equally effective at all doses studied ( Figure 7D ).",

Of outmost interest for rAAV vaccines, our results further demonstrate a strong requirement for transgene cross-presentation in the context of rAAV immunization, and they highlight transgene expression in hematopoietic cells as an important source of antigen for cross-presentation in the context of intramuscular, but not intradermal, immunization.",

IL-2 is a key cytokine for secondary proliferation of memory CD8 + T cells, 35 and the absence of potent IL-2 producers among rAAV-induced memory CTLs following intramuscular immunization has been correlated with reduced responses to a secondary boost. 7, 8 The impact of the route of administration on the priming of anti-transgene CTLs reported in our study is in line with previous reports performed in the context of gene therapy and vaccination with rAAV2 vectors. 2, 36 Namely, compared to intramuscular immunization, subcutaneous immunization has been shown to induce stronger CTL responses, 2 and intranasal immunization has been shown to induce enhanced frequencies of IL-2-producing anti-transgene CD8 + T cell responses. 36 While the precise phenotypes of memory CTL being generated has not been fully examined in these studies, we would like to suggest that the results obtained here in the skin regarding the quality of memory CD8 + T cell responses apply to other routes of immunization, such as the intranasal route.",

            "text": "An interesting question raised by our study is the exact nature of the mechanism(s) driving long-term memory CD8 + T cell differentiation following intradermal immunization. A number of mechanisms have been considered so far to explain the limited induction of potent effector/memory CTLs following intramuscular immunization with rAAV vectors. This includes rAAV-intrinsic, poor DC transduction ability 14 and insufficient inflammatory responses leading to poor MHC class I upregulation on myocytes 16 and sustained transgene expression, 7, 16 or transgene-intrinsic limitations, lack of potent MHC class II epitope in the construct. 7, 8 Our results suggest that a combination of signals might be needed. CD4 + T cell help is indeed required for the generation of bona fide memory CTLs following intradermal immunization with rAAV2/1 vectors, in line with its key impact on CTL cross-priming via DC \"licensing\" 37 or IL-2 production. 38 CD4 + T cell help by itself, however, only promoted enhanced differentiation of terminally differentiated KLRG1 + effector CD8 + T cells in the context of intramuscular immunization, as previously shown in the context of immune responses to several pathogens. 39 Interestingly, targeting the skin did not result in enhanced transgene expression in DCs at the time of the first wave of antigen presentation in the draining lymph node, although we cannot rule out earlier expression leading to multiple distinct T cell-DC interactions. 40 Moreover, the induction of potent anti-transgene memory CD8 + T cell responses following intradermal immunization appeared independent of transgene expression in hematopoietic cells. Finally, targeting the skin was indeed associated with a better long-term clearance of the transgene. However, whether loss of transgene expression precedes or is the result of the enhanced differentiation of CTLs is still unknown.",

            "text": "Differences in environmental cues [41] [42] [43] or DC subsets 44 are among the numerous mechanisms already proposed for the regulation of effector/memory CD8 + T cell fate. Our starting hypothesis was that the skin, which naturally harbors a very large and diverse DC population 21 in direct contact with the commensal flora, 45 would be less dependent than the skeletal muscle on vector-intrinsic inflammatory properties for the recruitment and activation of memory CD8 + T cells through the cross-presentation pathway. Combining, for the first time, in vivo and ex vivo analysis of transgene presentation by DCs with restriction of transgene expression to non-hematopoietic cells, our data highlight key differences between skeletal muscle and skin in anti-transgene T cell priming. In the context of intramuscular immunization, we found that presentation of hematopoietic cell-expressed transgene by lymph node-resident CD8a + DCs was essential to drive potent CD8 + T cell responses. Following intradermal immunization, lymphoid CD8a + DCs, as well as migratory CD103 + DCs, similarly presented hematopoietic cell-expressed transgene products. However, the complete loss of such presentation events only led to a 2-fold reduction at the peak of the primary CD8 + T cell response, and the sole cross-presentation of skin-expressed transgene was sufficient for the maximal induction of memory CTL responses. This points to a Previous studies had highlighted the potency of cross-presentation in vivo for the induction of primary CTL responses to vaccinia virus, 25 modified vaccinia virus Ankara, 46 or lentivirus vectors. 47 Our results now illustrate the key impact of the cellular source of antigen on the efficiency of such cross-presentation events, complementing previous studies in the field. 47, 48 Enhanced cross-presentation of cell-associ-ated antigen following local (intradermal) rather than systemic (intravenous) delivery has been described in the context of a membranebound OVA model antigen. 49 Our results suggest that this might represent a unique property of the skin not shared by all other peripheral tissues, including the skeletal muscle. The potency of skin-expressed transgene cross-presentation further suggests that efficient induction of memory CTL responses should solely depend on the ability of a given vector to drive antigen expression in non-hematopoietic skin cells. While this extends beyond the initial scope of this study, understanding whether this holds true in the context of other rAAV serotypes as well as injection techniques designed to better target the various layers of the skin, such as micro-needles, 50 patches and skin surface stripping, 22 or transcutaneous vaccination via laser microporation, 51 could prove of key interest. Overall, our study highlights the skin as a potentially interesting target site for future rAAV-based vaccines. Adding to the dose-sparing potential of intradermal immunization, 52 we believe that these results will prompt for a more global assessment of the potential of individual rAAV serotype to induce strong cell-mediated immune responses and protective memory following intradermal vaccination.",
