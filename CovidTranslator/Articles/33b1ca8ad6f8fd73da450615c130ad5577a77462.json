Her goal was to inspire all to work towards decreasing radiation exposure to children when possible. With the help of many, she founded the Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging and the Image Gently campaign, initially focusing on CT. Her ability to encourage numerous experts and societies to work together and get involved in \"child sizing the amount of radiation used\" has resulted in a groundswell of research and activity in this area. Currently 69 organizations with over 800,000 members have joined the Alliance including 24 international societies. The web site, www.imagegently.org, has been immensely successful filled with free information pamphlets in over 12 languages, PQI projects, and modules for parents, physicians, and technologists. The Image Gently Campaign has received several awards including the Associations Advance America Honor Roll, RT Image magazine group with the \"most influence in radiology\" and the Most Effective Philanthropy Program from Aunt Minnie. Image Gently has spawned the creation of the adult-focused Image Wisely campaign. The Alliance has been named by the Joint Commission, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the American Medical Association in their influential statements on radiation dose as providing much needed guidance and information. Marilyn's exceptional talent is inspiring and coordinating experts in multiple fields to work together towards common goals. She continues to work hard on the Image Gently campaign with more safety and quality messages planned for the coming years. She is also proud of her work with the ACR Dose Index Registry and Quality Improvement Registry in CT Scans in children in working toward developing diagnostic reference levels with a talented consortium of pediatric radiologists, medical physicists and technologists.

This has been a resounding success, is currently used in other categories during RSNA and is a model for other meetings, including the Annual Meeting for the Society for Pediatric Radiology over the past few years. Pediatric Radiology was first in this effort. George continued to endorse topics that were marquees for Pediatric Radiology over the year in his education role on the RSNA Board of Directors. He endorsed and implemented the Pediatric Campus concept at the 2011 RSNA. Early returns are that this was an extremely successful model to consolidate experts in pediatric radiology (and those interested in this subspecialty), pertinent science, education and administration.

The awardee is selected by the Honors Committee, a committee comprised of the three most recent past presidents of the Society. Dr. Royal is a proud native of Birmingham, Alabama. He is a second generation physician who came naturally to his desire to care for children as the son of a pediatrician, Arnold Royal, who took care of children in the Birmingham community until he was 79 years old. Dr. Royal attended Rice University in Houston, Texas followed by MD and MS degrees from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He subsequently moved to San Francisco, where he completed a pediatric internship followed by a diagnostic radiology residency at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Royal credits Dr. Charles Gooding at UCSF for influencing his decision to pursue a career in pediatric radiology. During his internship Stuart observed Dr. Gooding make a plain film diagnosis of TAPVR, type 3 on a severely ill and perplexing newborn, and he was immediately hooked into radiology. While at UCSF Dr. Royal was also appointed as a National Institute of Health research fellow in the Department of Radiology. Following residency, Stuart completed a fellowship in pediatric radiology at The Children's Hospital Medical Center in Boston.",

To help achieve this goal, he has worked aggressively to secure increased funding for the Society of Pediatric Radiology Research and Education Foundation.

Image Gently has succeeded not only in raising awareness of the great diagnostic benefits we can offer to pediatric patients but also directs us to acknowledge the downside of overzealous diagnostic efforts where excessive radiation becomes a risk. Importantly, the \"Image Gently\" campaign, an upbeat, positive program rather than a punitive one, a smile rather than a frown, makes pediatric and all radiologists aware that their best practice reflects balanced, educated, up-to-date utilization of state-of-the art technology with exercise of responsible leadership in protecting the pediatric patient.

Gawande 1 , Dr. D intuitively had the vision to \"coach\" his trainees, trying to get the best out of them, without pressure, but with love and passion, and especially emphasizing the importance of achieving a worklife balance in order to prevent the now so common \"stress and burnout\" affecting the radiology community 2 . He warned us that many high achievers reach their goals only at the expense of their personal lives, but Dr. D has been as successful personally as he is professionally. His wonderful wife of 40 years, Louise, his two daughters and his recently newborn granddaughter serve as sources of strength and pride. He is a truthful and generous friend to many, both in and out of radiology. It is not uncommon for many of us, who came through Sick Kids, to come back and visit and be invited to his house to share a wonderful dinner with other invitees, who may be radiologists from North America or from other parts of the globe visiting Sick Kids to learn from him.",

His classic textbook, Pediatric X-Ray Diagnosis, which was first published in 1945, has become the recognized bible and authority in its field. The seventh edition of this book was completed several months before his death in 1978. It has been among the most successful books of its kind in the medical field. Dr. Caffey was born in Castle Gate, Utah on March 30, 1895 . It is interesting that he was born in the same year that Roentgen discovered the x-ray. Dr. Caffey was graduated from University of Michigan Medical School in 1919, following which he served an internship in internal medicine at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. He spent three years in Eastern Europe with the American Red Cross and the American Relief Administration, and returned to the United States for additional training in medicine and in pediatrics at the Universities of Michigan and Columbia, respectively.",

Interstitial lung disease, which is more common in infants than older children, is defined as a rare heterogeneous group of parenchymal lung conditions primarily due to underlying developmental or genetic disorders. Affected infants typically present with clinical syndromes characterized by dyspnea, tachypnea, crackles, and hypoxemia. Mainly due to a lack of evidence based information regarding underlying pathogenesis, natural history, imaging findings, and histopathologic features of interstitial lung disease, the understanding of interstitial lung disease in infants has been limited in the past. However, in recent years, the understanding of interstitial lung disease in infants has been substantially improved primarily due to: 1) advances in imaging technology for better detection; 2) improvement of thoracoscopic techniques for lung biopsy; 3) established pathologic criteria for consistent diagnosis; and 4) development of new classification system based on underlying etiology of the interstitial lung disease. In fact, several forms of interstitial lung disease in infants that exhibit distinct clinical, radiological, and pathological patterns are currently emerging. The overarching goal of this article is to review a new classification system, imaging findings, and pathological correlation of interstitial lung disease in infants. Improved understanding of this often challenging disorder can aid in early and accurate diagnosis, which in turn, will result in improved patient care.",

In an environment where the rapid acquisition of CT data allows general hospitals to image children instead of referring them to specialist pediatric centers, it is vital that general radiologists have access to protocols appropriate for pediatric applications. This lecture will focus on the main principles of volumetric CT imaging that apply generically to all MDCT scanners and in particular we describe the reconstruction techniques for imaging the pediatric thorax and the low-dose protocols used in our institution on a 64-slice dual source CT scanner. Examples of important clinical applications with the impact and added value of post processing are also given. Neoplasms, by definition, comprise an abnormal uncoordinated proliferation of cells that persists even after the inciting stimulus as ceased. The resulting mass may be benign or malignant and arise from any tissue that is normally found in the location where the mass develops. Thus, tumors of the chest may arise from bone, lung, pleura, lymphatics, muscle, etc. Whether benign or malignant, chest masses may be incidental findings on imaging obtained for other reasons. This presentation will focus on malignant tumors of the chest, address the imaging characteristics and staging of the most common chest malignancies and discuss characteristics that may aid in distinguishing these lesions from their corresponding benign or infectious counterparts. Included in this presentation will be the most common chest wall malignancies (Ewing family of tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma), mediastinal malignancies (lymphoma, germ cell tumors, and neurogenic malignancies) and pulmonary primary malignancies (pleuropulmonary blastoma and carcinoid). The changing appearance of selected tumors in patients treated with new targeted therapies will be introduced.",

While conventional proton MRI has found widespread clinical application in most organs of the body, MRI of the lung lags behind because the lung is intrinsically difficult to image with MRI. The strength of the MR signal depends on the physical density of protons in the tissue being imaged and the local environment of the protons. The lung has a low physical density and thus a low proton density so little MR signal is generated by the lung. Furthermore, the magnetic susceptibility effects from its many air-tissue interfaces cause what little signal is generated to rapidly decay so that the lung typically appears dark on conventional proton MR images. A variety of strategies have been developed to overcome the inherent difficulties of MRI of the lung, resulting in recent substantial improvements in image quality. Additionally by administering an inhaled gaseous contrast agent, such as the hyperpolarized noble gases helium-3 or xenon-129, direct visualization of lung airspaces in an MR image is possible. A number of unique strategies for evaluating the structure and function of the human lung using hyperpolarized gas MRI have been developed. Although the level of structure detail possible with lung MRI may never equal that of CT, MRI may nonetheless has the potential to provide clinically useful information and be a sensitive, effort independent test of pediatric lung disease.

Taylor, MD This presentation reviews the types of diagnostic errors in abdominal imaging occurring over a 13-year period in an academic pediatric radiology practice. Radiologists engage in two interrelated processes when interpreting imaging studies: perception and analysis. Failures in perception (failure to identify an important finding) are a common source of diagnostic error in pediatric imaging, while failures in the analytic portion of the process (over-or faulty interpretation of a finding) are not as common. Under-interpretation of findings can be related to a number of perceptual and visual phenomena including visual isolation where attention is selectively focused on a main area of the image while less or no attention is given to secondary areas, and satisfaction of search which occurs when additional lesions remain undetected after detection of an initial lesion. Many analytic errors are the result of commonly used heuristics or shortcuts in reasoning. These include the availability heuristic in which likelihoods are based on memory of a similar case, the framing effect in which a different diagnosis is reached based on how the information is presented, and the anchoring heuristic in which the initial impression is difficult to change, despite conflicting new information. Another recognized pitfall is blind obedience, in which a diagnostician stops thinking when confronted by authority. This authority can be human or technical (reliance on a laboratory value). Finally, diagnostic errors can result from an attitude of overconfidence. Examples of these heuristics and strategies to minimize cognitive errors will be discussed.",

Genetic and molecular regulation of vascular genesis of angiogenesis, and mutations responsible for some of the vascular malformations, have been delineated. In order to implement future targeted treatment of vascular lesions, accurate diagnosis is important. Imaging modalities that are effective in distinguishing the various types of vascular anomalies and demonstrating the extent include ultrasonography with Doppler interrogation, MRI and various forms of MR vascular flow imaging, conventional angiography and venography. Techniques used to image lymphatic channel anomalies, conventional lymphangiography, lymphoscintigraphy and infrared fluorescent lymphangiography. In this presentation, common forms of vascular anomalies will be described and rare or recently recognized anomalies will be mentioned. Current treatment of the different forms of vascular anomalies will also be discussed, including pharmacotherapy using beta blockers, angiogenesis inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors. Endovascular techniques used in treating vascular malformations, including embolization and sclerotherapy will be presented. Pediatric vascular disease is extremely varied, with a wide range of conditions requiring diagnostic or therapeutic intervention. Technological improvements in non-invasive imaging modalities such as MRI and CT have reduced the need for diagnostic angiography; however, with advances in interventional techniques, arteriography in the pediatric patient is now often performed for therapeutic reasons.",

DWI can aid in the differentiation of benign from malignant lesions, which generally have restricted diffusion. There is even greater potential for DWI in the assessment of tumor response to therapy. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are critical to accurate interpretation of diffusion sequences. ADC maps distinguish between restricted diffusion and T2 effect, both of which appear bright on DWI. Both qualitative and quantitative tissue assessments can be made with DWI. Challenges for DWI in the pediatric musculoskeleton include susceptibility artifacts from bone, motion vulnerability, and geometric distortion at larger fields of view. Our current protocols and parameters for DWI will be presented. contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR using one of a variety of vendor specific sequences. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of inflow and distribution of contrast have been shown to help differentiate between benign and malignant lesions and to evaluate drug efficacy during therapy.

Subjective assessment of nodules by PET-CT does not appear to improve the ability to distinguish benign from malignant histology in children with solid malignancies. Semi-quantitative nodule assessment using the standardized uptake value may improve the performance of PET-CT in this setting and will be investigated in the future. Purpose or Case Report: NEC is the most common lifethreatening medical/surgical emergency of the gastrointestinal (GI) system in neonates, with an incidence up to 10% in infants weighing <1500 g. With advances in treatment of NEC, increased survival rates result in rise in post-NEC GI complications such as feeding intolerance. Development of post-NEC bowel strictures results from healing of involved bowel and can result in bowel obstruction. It has been routine to study the bowel of infants after medical treatment for NEC by contrast enema and small bowel follow-through prior to initiating feeding. However, in order to \"Image Gently\" we are attempting to decrease the radiation exposure to these patients. We postulate that in patients with no abnormal bowel dilation prior to initiation of feeds, the incidence of colonic stricture would be so low that routine enemas would be unnecessary and could be eliminated from the workup. recorded as present or absent in 6 anatomic abdominal regions defined as: 1 and 2-from the dome of the diaphragm to top of L2 to the right and left of midline, respectively; 3 and 4-from top of L2 to the iliac crest to the right and left of midline, respectively; 5-from the iliac crest to the top of the sacrosciatic notch; 6-below the top of the sacrosciatic notch. We assessed the frequency of findings in each region and how often findings in regions 5 and 6 were associated with findings in regions 1-4. 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: The fewest pertinent findings were present in region 6 in 10.2% (51/501) (95% CI: 7.7-13.1%) of radiographs. Findings included: abnormal bowel 6% (n031), bowel gas paucity 1.4% (n07), pneumatosis 0.4% (n02), inguinal hernia 0.8% (n04) and osseous abnormalities 1.2% (n06). Pertinent findings were present in region 5 in 67.7% (339/501) (95% CI: 63.4-71.8%). Findings included: abnormal bowel 43.7% (n0 219), bowel gas paucity gas 19.6% (n098), pneumatosis 1.6% (n08), free air 0.2% (n01), and abnormal bowel with pneumatosis 2.6% (n013). Among 51 patients with an abnormality in region 6, 49 (96.1%) also had an abnormality within at least one of regions 1 through 4. Among the 342 patients with an abnormality in region 5 or 6, 338 (98.3%) also had an abnormality within at least one of regions 1 through 4. Catheter/tube tips were located in region 5 in 6.8% (n034) and region 6 in 1.4% (n07) of radiographs, respectively. Pneumatosis was present most frequently in regions 3 (5.8%), 4 (4.0%), and 5 (4.2%). Free air was present most frequently in regions 1 (1.6%), regions 2 and 3 (0.6% each). Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggest that pertinent findings on neonatal portable abdominal radiographs are rarely isolated to the pelvis, implying that gonadal shielding of regions 5 and 6 should not compromise diagnostic accuracy.

Included studies were interpreted as positive, negative, or equivocal for appendicitis. Report impressions that did not specify one of these categories and studies where the appendix was not seen were excluded. The pathologic diagnosis of appendicitis was considered the gold standard for a positive diagnosis. Because virtually all pediatric surgical cases in the region are referred to our hospital, it was assumed that the patient did not have appendicitis if surgery was not performed. Logistic modeling using appendiceal diameter as the independent variable established cutoff diameters of \u22646 mm0negative, >8 mm0positive, and 6<x\u2264 8 mm0equivocal. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for both methods. Results: Of the 571 patients imaged during the study period, 255 (45%) met the inclusion criteria; 34 (6%) reports did not categorize the impression and in 282 (49%) studies the appendix was not seen.

Purpose or Case Report: Intussusception is an obstructive condition that a segment of the bowel invaginates into adjacent bowel and is an urgency that needs to be reduced as soon as possible to prevent bowel ischemia or necrosis. When it occurs in the infants and young child, it usually develops idiopathically and reduced by the technique such as air enema under the fluoroscopic guidance or saline enema under the ultrasound guidance. The success rate of the non-surgical reduction has reported over 95%. The pneumatic reduction is to introduce air into the patients' rectum via a ballooned Foley catheter by hand pump. A mercury manometer connecting with the Foley catheter calibrates the pressure of insufflation, and the recommended maximum pressure is 120 mmHg. The hydrostatic reduction is to drip saline from a bag at the height of 3 ft that may be different according to the institute's guidelines. Until recently, in both techniques, the precise measurement of the intraluminal pressure was not possible. With the purpose of intraluminal pressure monitoring, we introduced a specific digital pressure gauge that can measure both pneumatic and hydrostatic pressure in various units and can give the collected data to our workstation. With the data, we purpose to make the curve of intraluminal pressure during the procedure and to compare the pattern and difference in both techniques of reduction, which permits suggesting the better technique for reducing the intussusception. From February 2011, we performed the intraluminal pressure monitoring in 8 children; 4 cases of pneumatic reduction and 4 cases hydrostatic reduction. The results indicated that the curves were similar in both techniques. However, the hydrostatic reduction tended to need longer time and higher pressure difference than the pneumatic reduction. We assumed that a higher flow rate and more fluctuating introduction of pressure in the pneumatic reduction made the difference between both methods. Purpose or Case Report: Anecdotal evidence suggests that some pediatric brain tumors, particularly pilocytic astrocytomas, demonstrate greater enhancement on delayed post-contrast T1 weighted MR imaging compared to early post-contrast imaging. Our goal was to compare immediate post-contrast imaging with delayed post-contrast imaging in pediatric brain tumors.",

Purpose or Case Report: Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a new technique that exploits susceptibility differences in different tissues, to provide a different type of tissue contrast. SWI is a gradient echo sequence utilizing both phase and magnitude data to achieve exquisite sensitivity to tissue magnetic susceptibility effects. It is extremely sensitive to even minute amounts of paramagnetic substances and therefore for detection of blood products (hemosiderin, ferritin), deoxygenated blood, calcium, iron, and small vein depiction. It is particularly suited for vascular imaging, especially in cerebral ischemia. SWI has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting cerebral microbleeds than is conventional T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo imaging (GRE) partly because of its inherent sensitivity, increased spatial resolution and the thinner slices acquired. Recent studies have shown that SWI detected more microbleeds in more patients, irrespective of their location and that SWI may be more sensitive in detecting traumatic lesions than CT or MRI.",

Purpose or Case Report: A common problem with pediatric MR imaging is motion. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is highly sensitive to the effects of both rigid-body motion and brain pulsation. The resulting motion artifacts can manifest in several ways, and include blurring (motion between volumes), slice 'drop-outs' (motion during the diffusion encoding), and aliasing (motion during the parallel imaging/ghost calibration scan). In order to improve image quality in pediatric DWI and avoid the potential for repeat scans, we have implemented our GRAPPA-accelerated diffusion tensor (DT)-EPI sequence on over 1,600 pediatric patients at our institution, and have developed tailored reconstruction software to correct for large motion and reduce the need for general anesthesia (GA).",

With these data, we investigate the use of a method to select the best GRAPPA and ghost calibration weights; 3D rigid-body realignment with importance weighting; a new volume rejection criterion for large motion; together with other procedures to lower image noise and reduce phase artifacts. All image reconstruction was performed using compiled threaded MATLAB code on the vendor's (GE) multiprocessor reconstruction hardware. Results: Using the maximum motion detected from the 3D realignment procedure on the 1,600 DTI exams, 51% of patients did not move (either through co-operation or GA, denoted here by <1 mm of motion); 28% of patients moved between 1-3 mm; 13% between 3-5 mm; 6% between 5-10 mm; and 2% between 10-18 mm. Except for 3 patients in total, the motion correction steps employed here were extremely robust in correcting for motion. In addition, the motion correction steps employed here do not blur or negatively affect the data on non-moving patients. Conclusions: Our proposed integrated reconstruction scheme suggests that correcting for different types of motion at different stages of the DTI acquisition is critical to provide scans of diagnostic quality. Apart from the very rare instance (0.2%) where the patient moved continuously an extensively throughout the scan, our motion correction procedures employed here are extremely robust. Using this scheme, we show that highly diagnostic motion-corrected DTI data can routinely be read on our patient database within 10 min. . Participating sites followed mutually agreed upon vendor-specific DTI protocols used for neonates in clinical practice: SS-EPI; b 0700;~2 mm3 voxel; 30-32 directions; TE~84 msec; 1 acquisition; parallel imaging; multi-channel (8-32) head coil. Tensor data was analyzed at one site using internally developed software in IDL. B0 and eddy current distortion were assessed by analyzing grid line distortion on ACR slice 5 ; deviations from linearity were measured in the phase encoding direction. ACR slice 7 was used to assess SNR of the center and periphery of the b00 image, and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the phantom, which should approach 0. Deviations from specified sequence parameters were recorded. Results: Both Siemens scanners had some image degradation due to vibration susequently corrected by the vendor. Nonlinear gridline distortion was highest on the GE followed by Philips but was corrected with the use of 2nd order shimming. Eddy current distortion was consistently smaller than acquisition voxel size after image registration. TE varied from 74-92 msec; acquisition bandwidth range was 1563-2928 Hz/pixel. The 2 mm slice thickness was problematic on clinical GE scanners resulting in non-isotropic voxels. Across vendors, SNR was consistently higher in the image periphery than center by a factor of 1. 30-0.45 ). The greatest difference was showed in patients with FHC. No association was found between the value of LDL-C and IMT. The 62.5% received drug treatment at the time of evaluation. In DBT-1 a no association was found between the IMT and the levels of HbA1c and lipids. And in the OB group found no association between IMT and BMI Z score. FHC 31%, 8% of DBT-1 and 6% of OB showed atherosclerotic plaques and intima irregularities.",

This allows clinical applications of preventive and therapeutic guidance. A benchmark for precision of flow assessment was determined from differences between aortic and pulmonary arterial flows, which should agree. The precision of flow when utilizing a slow flow structure (vein) and a fast flow structure (artery) was then determined, serving as an indicator of the precision of slow flow measurements. This was done in pairs for the upper body (SVC flow vs difference between ascending and descending aortic flow), lower body (IVC flow vs descending aortic flow) & total body (SVC flow+IVC flow vs ascending aortic flow). Paired t-tests were used to identify significant differences in the respective arterial and venous flow rates. With an f-test, the relative precision of the arterial flow (determined from aortic and pulmonary arterial flow) was compared against the precision of agreement between upper, lower, and total body flows, each of which has a slow flow venous component, thus assessing precision of venous flow measurement. Results: Arterial & venous flow measurements were strongly correlated for the upper body (r00.89), lower body (r00.96) and total body flow (r00.97); net aortic and net pulmonary trunk flow rates were also tightly correlated (r00.97).

A larger sample size of children could support the idea of abnormal myocardial mechanics being a diagnostic imaging marker for the development of myocardial iron overload and eventual iron-mediated cardiomyopathy. The choice of coil and field of view varied according to the age and size of the patient. Imaging was performed on a 1.5 T magnet (Philips MRI system). After the cine gradient echo time of flight sequences were acquired, the dynamic keyhole MR angiographic sequence was applied in the coronal orientation. This sequence commenced 2-5 s after initiation of the first bolus administration of 2-10 mL of undiluted gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.5 mmol/mL, Magnevist) at a rate of 2-3 mL/sec followed by 10-20 mL of saline at a rate of 2 mL/sec. Image acquisition was repeated multiple times without delay for 60 s during shallow breathing. Contrast material was administered through a peripheral or central venous line, and sometimes via simultaneous bilateral extremity injections. Rarely manual hand injection was performed. The parameters were as follows: CENTRA k-space filling, acquired voxel size 1-1.2 x 1-1.2 x 2-3, reconstructed voxel size 0.4-1 x 0.4-1 x 1-1.5, number of dynamics 8-20, keyhole percentage 25-38%, SENSE (parallel imaging) factor 2x1-2x2, dynamic times 1-3.6 s, and injection rate 1-3 cc/second. Image analysis was based on original contrast-enhanced data sets, MIP and volume rendering. The quality of the MRV was graded by a subjective scale from 1-5 (10excellent, no limitations; 50nondiagnostic). Comparison with unenhanced MR venographic sequences and Doppler ultrasound were available in all cases. Results: 4D MRV provided diagnostic information on patency of venous segments in all cases, including the presence of venous occlusion or stenosis, the segments involved, and collateral venous pathways. Conclusions: 4D MR venography using the method outlined is a reliable means of estimating central venous thrombosis in children, using short dynamic scan times with high spatial and temporal resolution, creating an effect similar to conventional venography.",

The course of the left and right coronary arteries was also evaluated based on a 4 point scale, focusing on how well the evaluator was able to visually follow the coronary artery from its origin to its termination. Radiation dose was recorded and compared. Results: The mean score of the homogeneity of vascular enhancement, stair step artifacts, image noise and signal, overall image quality, and score given to visualization of the course of the coronary arteries showed no significant difference (p>0.35) in the retrospective and prospective ECG gated groups. The mean estimated effective dose was significantly lower for the prospective ECG gated group compared to the retrospective group, (0.83 mSV vs 2.39 mSV) respectively (p<0.0005).",

Prospective ECG gated cardiac MDCT is a powerful adjunct to the treatment and surgical planning of pediatric patients with congenital heart disease less than 1 yr of age with lower radiation dose. Methods & Materials: 3 pediatric neuroradiology lectures were recorded and made available to 29 radiology residents at a university program through on-line streaming video viewed through an internet link. Topics included brain tumors, phakomatosis, and congenital brain malformations. One lecture per week was recommended prior to case conferences that reviewed the same topic. Pre-and post-tests and a feedback survey were administered. Nonparametric paired sign test and analysis of covariance were used to evaluate changes in test scores overall and according to feedback responses. Spearman's partial rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between the number of viewed videos and test scores. Results: Twenty-nine residents completed the pre-test and 28 the post-test. The means (SD) scores were 59.3% (12.0%) and 64.8% (14.2%) respectively. There was a significant improvement in test scores (p 00.019). Residents that agreed/strongly agreed that the streaming technology lectures were convenient had greater improvement than those who did not (14.0 vs. -3.2%, p00.001). Similarly, those who agreed/strongly agreed that being able to replay a lecture was helpful had greater improvement than those who did not (10.9 vs. -6.7%, p 00.001). Finally, those who agreed/ strongly agreed that the streaming technology lecture format was a better teaching tool had greater improvement than those who did not (10.8 vs. -4.7%, p00.003). Significant positive correlation between number of videos watched postconference and improvement was present (Spearman's rho0 0.48, p00.013).",

Purpose or Case Report: Premature birth is associated with white matter injury leading to a wide ventricular system. However,normative standards for ventricular size are lacking for this particular group.Aims: We aimed to, in a controlled, population based Norwegian cohort of ex-prematures without major handicaps, and for men and women separately,to 1) create standards for radiological indices of ventricular dilatation, 2)investigate associations of these measurements with subjectively assessed ventricular size,3) examine differences in ventricular size between ex-prematures and healthy controls Methods & Materials: The initial birth cohort included 217 neonates, birth weight below 2000 g (low birth weight)born within Hordaland county, Norway, between April 1st 1986 and August 8th 1988. 113 of 174 eligible survivors (without major handicaps)underwent MR examination during the period January 2006 to May 2007. 103 of these were expremature (born before gestational age 37 weeks) and were included in this sub-study. Based on T2 weighted images, the ventricular size was subjectively judged as being normal, mildly, moderately or severely dilated by an experienced paediatric neuroradiologist, while objective measurements were performed in a blinded fashion, by a second observer (SMA) using an imaging software program (Nordic Ice\u00ae). Results: The normative standards for the ventricular system in ex-premature young adults showed wide variations, in particular for the occipital horns. The agreement between subjective and objective assessment of ventricular size was good. Ex-prematures had smaller heads than those born term (control group). There was no difference in ventricular size between the two groups, even after adjusting for head size. Ex-premature males had larger ventricles than females; however, the difference disappeared after adjusting for head size.",

Friedman Purpose or Case Report: Patients with red blood cell transfusion-dependent conditions receive high amounts of iron that can lead to abnormal iron accumulation in tissues resulting in organ damage. While the liver is the dominant excess iron storage organ, iron related cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Therefore, accurate determination and tracking of tissue iron levels in both the liver and the myocardium is important for patient prognostication as well as monitoring treatment changes. While multi-echo gradient echo MRI (T2*) is widely used and validated method employed for iron assessment, less attention has been given to derived metrics. Specifically, the literature almost exclusively reports and uses the mean value for T2* from a pixel-wise (PW) map. Infrequently used is the median. The median is a potentially superior metric than the mean because it is insensitive to outliers. Outliers will always occur in data because of either noise or imperfect vessel exclusion.",

Z-axis scan lengths for the chest CT exams ranged from 10.1-33.3 cm. A z-axis scan length of 14 cm centered 3.5 cm below the carina captured all PEs in all patients, and a length of 12 cm centered 3.5-4 cm below the carina in patients with CHD. A z-axis scan length of 8 cm centered 5 cm below the carina was sufficient to capture at least one PE in all patients, and a length of 8 cm centered 4-5 cm below the carina in patients with CHD.

We report data in animal models exemplifying its advantages over conventional contrast in the setting of CT pulmonary angiography Methods & Materials: NCTX blood pool nanoparticles of 125 nm diameter with an encapsulated total iodine concentration of~125mgI/ml were administered by intravenous injection to mice, rabbits, dogs, pigs and sheep. (These studies were actually conducted for other purposes and a review of the data revealed the similarities that motivated this paper.) Total injected volumes were~5 ml/kg in large animals, and as high as 10 ml/kg in small animals to provide satisfactory vessel enhancement. Iohexol or iopamidol was administered for comparative studies with conventional contrast. In a subset of pigs, iatrogenic pulmonary arterial emboli were introduced prior to contrast administration. Toxicity studies were conducted in mice and monkeys. Results: The visualization of pulmonary vessels using NCTX blood pool nanoparticles was generally at least equivalent to using conventional contrast, and superior in several cases, particularly in small veins and when bolus timing of the conventional contrast was suboptimal. In all cases, satisfactory vessel enhancement was achieved for a duration of several hours following a single infusion of NCTX blood pool nanoparticles. There was no evidence of renal toxicity, and only transient elevation of hepatic enzymes at relevant dose levels. Conclusions: NCTX nanoparticle blood pool agents demonstrate several advantages over conventional glomerularfiltered iodinated contrast agents for CT pulmonary angiography in animal models, including no nephrotoxicity, no dependence on bolus injection technique, superior depiction of small veins, and capability of re-imaging for follow-up studies without needing contrast re-injection. Potential applications in human pediatric subjects include the diagnostic and post-therapeutic evaluation of cardiopulmonary anomalies and pulmonary embolism, especially in patients with renal insufficiency or tenuous vascular access.

Retrospective EKG gated CT imaging was performed 3 h later using a 128-slice dual-source CT scanner at 80 and 120 kVp. Two radiologists analyzed and graded (on a 5-point scale with 1: unreadable, 5: Excellent) images aimed at anatomic structures relevant to CHD.

Pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein branch visualization extended up to the 5th generation in all cases. Visualization of coronary artery branches was possible up to the second generation, with good arteriovenous separation. Subtle morphologic features including crista terminalis, Thebesian valve, foramen ovale, membranous septum, and chordae of the mitral valve were demonstrated in all cases. Automated functional analysis and myocardial mass quantitation was feasible in all cases. There was no significant difference in blood pool attenuation between the atria, ventricles, and extracardiac vasculature on quantitative assessment. No image artifacts were visible on the reconstructed images. Conclusions: These findings suggest that NCTX promises to be superior to conventional contrast agents for CT imaging of complex congenital heart disease, due to the absence of nephrotoxicity, avoidance of repeated contrast administration, and reduced number of scans performed. Avoiding the need for accurately timed scans precludes the need for large bore intravenous access. These attributes make it a promising agent that warrants further studies.

            "text": "Theoretical Cost and X-Ray Dose Reduction in Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease Imaging by the Use of a Nanoparticle Contrast Agent Robert Bell, The University of Texas-Houston; Rajesh Krishnamurthy, Gabriela Espinosa, Christopher Petit, Ananth Annapragada Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of this study is to determine the effective, population averaged reduction in costs and radiation dose that can be achieved in the diagnosis of congenital heart disease by use of a nanoparticle long circulating blood pool contrast agent. Methods & Materials: A Markov model of the decision tree followed at the Texas Children's Hospital in the image based diagnosis of congenital heart disease was constructed in TreeAge software. The model included CT Angiography, MR Angiography, cardiac catheterization, and echocardiography diagnostic modalities. Patient records, accumulated between 2003 and 2011 were examined to inform the model. The radiation dose and cost for each step were encoded as penalty functions. Markov simulations were run for two decision trees: (1) utilizing CT angiography and (2) replacing conventional CT angiography with blood-pool agent based CT angiography. The overall population X-ray dose and accrued cost was calculated for each pass through the model. Results: X-ray dose distributions for the example populations showed substantial reductions per CT study, as much as 50%. Averaged over the population, since a sizeable fraction of patients are diagnosed without ever being exposed to any X-ray based modality, reductions were more modest, but still substantial. Costs per CT study were slightly higher when the blood pool contrast agent was used. When the diagnostic probability using the blood pool agent increased, it led to an automatic overall cost reduction. Conversely when the diagnostic probability remained unchanged, costs rose, commensurate with the increased cost of the contrast agent. Conclusions: The use of a blood pool contrast agent for CT angiography leads to substantial reduction in radiation dose in the setting of congenital heart disease. Cost reductions are more modest, and are driven almost completely by the reduction in the number of MR and invasive angiography procedures resulting from increased diagnostic success using blood pool based CT angiography. The model as constructed does not account for potential workflow changes that might result from the use of a new contrast agent. Actual reductions realized may therefore be higher.

As the first step in the segmental analysis of structural heart disease, the determination situs position is of fundamental importance. Abdominal situs, as defined by splenic position and morphology, and cardiac situs, as defined by atrial morphology, are usually but not always in agreement. Echocardiographers also employ the relative position of the great arteries and vein at the hiatus to determine cardiac situs. We evaluate the frequencies of discordances among abdominal, hiatal and cardiac situses. Methods & Materials: With retrospective IRB approval, imaging records from 2001 to 2011 were reviewed for the diagnosis of cardiac situs inversus and heterotaxy. Patients who had cardiac CT or MRI were included. Images were evaluated on a 3D-processing station by a cardiac radiologist. Cardiac situs was determined by the morphology of the atrial appendages. When an atrial appendage was not adequately visualized, cardiac situs was assessed by the relative position of the main pulmonary artery and bronchi. Hiatal situs was determined by the relative position of the aorta and the systemic venous return, and abdominal situs by the position and morphology of the spleen. Results: Thirty-five cases were identified, with 23 cardiac CT and 12 MRI. Patients' age ranged from 1 day to 35 years old. In the abdomen, the numbers of situs inversus, asplenia, and polysplenia were 11 (32%), 12 (34%), and 12 (34%). For the heart, the numbers of situs solitus, inversus, rightisomerism, and left-isomerism were 2 (6%), 13 (37%), 11 (31%) and 9 (26%). The abdominal and cardiac situses were discordant in 5 (14%) cases. Polysplenia had the highest number of discordance with the heart. Hiatal situs was discordant with the abdomen in 5 cases (16%) and with the heart in 8 (25%) cases. Conclusions: Situs disagreement between the abdomen and the heart is not uncommon and they should be documented separately in radiology reports. Hiatal situs, as used by echocardiographer, disagrees with the cardiac situs in a quarter of the cases. It should be used with caution in the segmental analysis.",

Acosta Purpose or Case Report: We observed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal abnormality in the anterior cingulate gyrus of pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The cingulate gyrus could play a role in cognitive deficits of NF1 patients. The first objective here is to document inter-rater reliability scores for visual detection of this sign. The second objective is comparing ADC values of the cingulate gyrus in areas of visually abnormal MRI signal in NF1 patients to matched normal MRIs to confirm a pathophysiological basis of the visual MRI sign. Methods & Materials: Retrospective analysis, IRB approved, 61 NF1 patients and 38 matched controls. In the visual assessment part, two blinded neuroradiologists rated presence or absence of MRI signal abnormality in the cingulate gyrus in three different age groups of NF1 patients mixed with normal controls. Cohen's Kappa inter-rater reliability coefficients were calculated. The same blinded neuroradiologists evaluated the cohort one year later, this time by agreement at the workstation. In the ADC measurements part, two researchers, one blinded, manually placed ROI's in the anterior and posterior cingulate regions of 26 NF1 patients and their matched controls, and student t-test was used to assess for significance of differences in measured values.",

Poliakov, Sandra L. Poliachik, Dennis W. Shaw Purpose or Case Report: Often diagnosed at birth or in early childhood, mitochondrial disease presents with a variety of clinical symptoms, particularly in organs and tissues that require high energetic demand such as brain, heart, liver, and skeletal muscles. In a group of pediatric patients identified to have complex I or I/III deficits, but with white matter tissue appearing qualitatively normal for age, we hypothesized that quantitative DTI analyses might unmask deficits in microstructural integrity. Methods & Materials: DTI and structural MR brain imaging data were collected in 10 pediatric patients with confirmed mitochondrial disease and 10 clinical control subjects matched for age, gender, scanning parameters, and date of exam. Paired Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) were performed to evaluate differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Results: In patients with mitochondrial disease, significant widespread reductions in FA values were shown in white matter tracts. MD values were significantly increased in patients, having a sparser distribution of affected regions compared to FA. Results of TBSS statistical analysis will be shown. To be shown in green is the mean FA skeleton which represents the centers of main white matter tracts. All results p<.05. Red and yellow represent a significant increase, blue and light blue represent a significant decrease. Conclusions: Despite qualitatively normal appearing white matter tissues, patients with confirmed mitochondrial disease have widespread microstructural changes measurable with quantitative DTI. This supports the evaluation of such metrics in other populations where gross imaging features may be normal. To extend our studies to patients with other PLP1 mutations, we analyzed the brains of 52 male PMD patients (ranging in age from 2 to 45) and 9 female carriers for whom the PLP1 genotype had been determined and analyzed by MRI. For each patient we measured, white matter volume (WMV) and the intercaudate distance (ICD). The MRI data were correlated with functional disability scores (FDS) using a system we developed for clinical evaluation of PMD patients and which was validated by assessments of 22 PMD patients. Brain volume and segmentation were measured using NIH image 1.62. The average number of coronal slices analyzed from each patients MRI was 60 slices. When graywhite contrast was not adequate, then the Intercaudate distance (ICD) and intercaudate ratio were measured as described in Caon et. al., (2003) . Results: Comparison of the MR measurements and the FDS demonstrated that white matter volume inversely correlates with functional disability, suggesting that the initial disability does correlate with the extent of myelination. The intercaudate distance also correlated with the FDS, and may usefully substitute when gray-white matter segmentation is not possible. Conclusions: PMD is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the major CNS myelin protein, proteolipid protein (PLP). Myelin is a major target of disease pathogenesis in most cases of PMD, but how the various mutations cause clinical disability is not fully understood. Our data demonstrate that the extent of brain white matter atrophy, measured directly by volumetric fractionation, or indirectly by analyzing the intercaudate ratio, is significantly correlated with the patient's functional disability. White matter atrophy is thus the main cause of clinical disability in patients with PMD of all ages and mutation type.",

Hayes, Richard A. Jones Purpose or Case Report: Language localization is of paramount importance when contemplating surgery in children with intractable epilepsy or brain tumors. The potential risk of injury to language centers in the developing pediatric brain needs to be weighed against the potential benefits of surgery. In the past, language localization was crudely and invasively determined using the WADA test. Most institutions are now transitioning to non invasive localization using functional MRI (fMRI). The purpose of our study was to analyze language localization relative to age in children using age appropriate language paradigms and fMRI. Methods & Materials: Forty three healthy, English speaking, right handed children underwent fMRI evaluation for language localization. The studies were performed on a 3 T system. Three novel age appropriate language block paradigms were utilized, targeted both to expressive and receptive language processing. These paradigms were the auditory category decision task (AUDCAT), the auditory description decision task (ADDT), and the Listening task. The spatial statistical maps generated by the fMRI data were fused to the 3D anatomical MRI dataset. Language areas were localized and statistical analysis was performed with age as the variable in a general linear model. Results: Our results demonstrate a distinct trend in language localization and lateralization with brain maturation. In the young age groups (less than 12 years) the localization tended to be less focused and bilateral in the frontal and temporal regions of the brain. In the older age groups (greater than 12 years), language became more localized and lateralized to the expected left sided pattern. The findings were more robustly demonstrated with the ADDT task and were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our study clearly demonstrates the plasticity of language centers in the maturing pediatric brain. This observation is significant for neurosurgical planning and rehabilitation in the pediatric population. (3) no SLC26A4 mutations were found in 16, 12 and 47 subjects, respectively. Significantly higher association with SLC26A4 mutations was found in bilateral EVA+V/C dysplasia (16/18). Double mutations of SLC26A4 is more often associated with combined EVA+ V/C dysplasia, while a single mutation with EVA only. Cochlear aplasia without EVA (0/2) and SNHL with normal imaging (3/21) are less likely associated with SLC26A4 mutation. Conclusions: SLC26A4 mutation is highly associated with EVA and V/C dysplasia. Once EVA with or without V/C dysplasia are found at imaging, genetic investigation is recommended for SLC26A4 mutation because of possible thyroid involvement. moderate-severe HIE who were randomized to cooling (33.5\u00b0C for 72 h). There were 73 in the hypothermia group and 63 in the control group. All MRIs were reviewed by a cental reader masked to the clinical findings, groupings, and outcomes. The MRI findings were scored according to pattern and extent of injury, including involvement of the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, thalami, internal capsules, and other structures. Brain injury scores were correlated with death or disability at 18 months postnatal age. Results: No MRI abnormalities were observed in 38 of 73 infants (52%) in the hypothermia group and in 22 of 63 infants (35%) in the control group (P00.08). Infants in the hypothermia group had fewer areas of injury (12%) as compared with the control group (22%, P0 0.02). There were 51 of the 136 infants with death or disability at 18 months. The brain injury score correlated with outcome of death or disability (P00.001) and disability among survivors (P00.0001). Conclusions: Fewer areas of brain injury on MRI were observed following whole-body hypothermia. The MRI brain injury score is a marker of death or disability at 18 months following hypothermia for term HIE. . Presence or absence of the \"red dot\" on FA color maps was correlated to clinical (ataxia, oculomotor abnormalities etc.) and morphological data, and to FA and MD measurements. Results: The \"red dot\" was absent in JS and HGPPS (genetic cross wiring impairment diseases) and present in COMA and WVS (no reported gene abnormalities so far) as in normal controls. JS and COMA presented on MRI molar tooth appearance. HGPPS presented \"split pons\" appearance. JS and COMA patients presented oculomotor apraxia, WVS and HGPPS palsy of the horizontal gaze. Mirror movements were found in 2 JS and in WVS. Ipsilateral responses are present in HGPPS. WVS presented multiple cranial nerves impairment. In JS, FA and MD values of SCP, PT and PC were significantly lower than in normal controls (p >0.01). In HGPPS high FA and low MD were found in PC and PT (p >0.01) and normal in SCP. Conclusions: The \"red dot\" absence is unrelated to morphological or clinical abnormalities. Absence of the \"red dot\" is associated to abnormal measurements of FA and MD in PC and PT( low in JS and high in HGPPS). These findings indicate a pivotal role for the PC in the physiopathology of these diseases. The \"red dot\" absence seems to be a marker of genetic cross wiring diseases. In this view, COMA and WVS should not be considered as part of these diseases.",

            "text": "Sonographic Predictors of Intermittant Testicular Torsion in the Pediatric Patient Jennifer Williams, MD, Pediatric Radiology, Texas Children's Hospital, jlwilli1@texaschildrens.org; Marthe Munden Purpose or Case Report: Intermittent testicular torsion (ITT), defined as sudden onset unilateral scrotal pain with spontaneous resolution, is difficult to confirm both clinically and sonographically. The purpose of this study was to determine if sonographic predictors exist for diagnosing ITT in the pediatric patient. Methods & Materials: A search of the PACS data system for patients presenting with suspected intermittent testicular torsion was performed. Fifteen patients with a total of 20 episodes presenting over a 2 year period were found. A retrospective review of the medical records for clinical presentation, surgical outcome, and comorbidities was performed. Scrotal ultrasound images and reports were reviewed for testicular size and echotexture, testicular flow, epididymal appearance, vascular bundle appearance, and presence of hydrocele. Results: An abnormal appearance of the vascular bundle was found in 85% of episodes (17/20). Initial absence of testicular flow followed by reperfusion during the scan was seen in 30% of episodes (6/20); 45% had increased flow (9/ 20), 10% had decreased flow (2/20), and 15% had normal flow (3/20) . Nine of the 15 patients had surgery; of these 8 were found to have evidence of ITT and 1 was found to have acute testicular torsion. Of patients with ITT, 88% (7/8) had an abnormal vascular bundle. Testicular flow was not initially visualized but returned during the exam in 50% of patients (4/8), was increased in 38% of patients (3/7) and was decreased in 13% patients (1/8). Conclusions: ITT is a difficult diagnosis. The most reliable sonographic indicator is an abnormal spermatic cord, found in 85% of episodes and 88% of surgically proven ITT. Dedicated views of the spermatic cord must be obtained in order to differentiate an abnormal epididymis from an engorged vascular bundle (the so-called pseudomass). Attention to testicular flow is of particular importance. While visualization of a transition from no or decreased testicular flow to normal flow during the sonogram is certainly diagnostic of ITT, increased testicular flow should not lead to false reassurance. Purpose or Case Report: Testicular torsion is a common acute condition in boys requiring prompt and accurate diagnosis. The objective was to evaluate ultrasound accuracy and findings, and clinical predictors in testicular torsion in boys presenting to the Stollery pediatric emergency department (ED) with acute scrotal pain. Methods & Materials: Retrospective review of US, surgical and ED records for boys aged 1 month to 17 years, presenting with acute scrotum from 2008 to 2011, was performed. Age, demographics, clinical symptoms, physical findings, US and surgical techniques, findings and diagnoses were recorded. Surgical results and follow-up were used as the gold standard as all pediatric urology in our region is performed at our centre. Results: 343 patients presented to ED with acute scrotum with the following diagnoses: 35 testicular torsion, 11 possible torsion-detorsion, 3 torsion of appendix testes, 135 epididymo-orchitis, and 159 other. Of 266 US performed, 29 boys had torsion confirmed by surgery. There were 8 inconclusive US reports, none of which had torsion at surgery or follow-up. The false positive rate of US was 1.5% (4 patients), and there were no false negatives. Six torsion patients had no US. Median time from ED to US and surgery for torsion patients was 159 and 303 min. Six patients had non-salvageable testes. Diagnostic accuracy of US compared to surgery was 96% for torsion and 67% for other. Sonographic heterogeneity was seen in 80% of patients with testes that the surgeon felt were non-viable at surgery and 72% of patients with viable testes (p00.35). Sudden-onset scrotal pain (92%), abnormal position (86%) and absent cremasteric reflex (91%,) were most prevalent in torsion patients. Conclusions: Color Doppler US is accurate and sensitive for diagnosis of torsion in the setting of acute scrotum. Despite heterogeneity on pre-operative US, many testes were felt to be salvageable at surgery. Rate of salvage of torsion was high. Common symptoms and findings of torsion were sudden onset of pain, abnormal testicular position and absent cremasteric reflex.",

Bandarkar, Dorothy Bulas Purpose or Case Report: Fallopian tube torsion is a rare cause of acute pelvic pain in a young female and requires prompt diagnosis for immediate surgical intervention. Our purpose is to review varied imaging findings of surgically proven cases of tubal torsion. Methods & Materials: Retrospective review of our data base from 2007 to 2011 revealed 7 cases of surgically proven fallopian tube torsion. Ages ranged from 9 to 15 years of age. All had pelvic ultrasound performed, 3 cases had additional CT performed for acute pelvic pain. Results: US findings included thickened dilated tubular hypoechoic structure (5), cystic mass (4); adnexal (3), midline (1). Five cases had normal ovaries bilaterally (2 with paratubal cysts). CT imaging findings include dilated, fluid filled, thickwalled tube with internal hyperdensity (40HU) likely debris/ hemorrhage in 1 case. Additional findings included cystic adnexal mass (3 cases), beak sign (1 case) and increased vascularity (1 case). Secondary signs included free fluid (5), peritubular fat stranding (1), vascular congestion and thickening of the broad ligament (1) and enlarged draining vein (1). Laparoscopic salphingectomy was performed in 3 cases (including 2 cases with isolated tubal torsion). Laparoscopic detorsion was performed in a total of 4 cases. In addition, laparoscopic cyst drainage was performed in 2 out of these 4 cases. Detorsion with paratubal cystectomy and hemorrhagic ovarian cystectomy was performed in 1 of the 4 cases. Conclusions: Imaging diagnosis of tubal torsion can be difficult. It can occur in isolation with a dilated thickened tubular structure adjacent to a normal ovary or potentially mimic appendicitis, pyosalpinx, complex adnexal cyst or cystic adnexal neoplasm. Presence of normal ovaries, beaked tapered tubular structure with intratubal fluid level and hemorrhage may help in making the diagnosis. It is important to recognize this entity in a patient with acute pelvic pain to facilitate prompt tubal sparing surgery.",

Ultrasound, CT, and MRI exams were used for renal length measurement. Renal lengths were assessed for each age group, first as an average length of all the patients within that age group overall, and subsequently as an average renal length by age group divided into the following time frames after transplantation: 0-30 days, 31-90 days, 91-180 days, and 181+ days. Clinic chart information collected included BUN, creatinine, weight, and medication use. Results: Renal length was measured using 278 imaging cases, distributed across each age group as follows: 6-12 months, N 011; 13 months-2.5 years, N 030; 2.6-4.5 years, N033; 4.6-7.5 years, N038; 7.6-11.5 years, N0 51; 11.6 years and higher, N0115. Renal lengths were greater, on average, within every age group, compared with previously established normative age-related renal lengths (Rosenbaum et al.) . The augmented renal lengths universally were observed in the 0-30 day post-transplantation timeframe. Return to normal renal lengths typically occurred by 6 months post transplant. Clinic chart review revealed that the majority (87%) of patients received nephrotoxic medication within two weeks of imaging. Conclusions: Pediatric BMT patients have larger kidneys in the absence of known renal disease than age-matched peers. A revised, age-based renal length chart for post-BMT patients has been generated which should help prevent the misdiagnosis of nephromegaly in this population, eliminating unnecessary diagnostic evaluations. Multiple etiologies to explain renal enlargement in these patients are possible, including fluid overload, nephrotoxic medication, or direct effect of the transplant. Purpose or Case Report: MR urography can be a comprehensive exam for anatomical and functional pediatric renal evaluation. Quantification of renal function may benefit when dynamic contrast enhanced images can be obtained at high spatiotemporal resolution and with minimal respiratory motion artifacts. Though respiratory triggering may decrease motion artifacts, it results in loss of temporal resolution by a factor of about three.",

            "text": "A two-echo gradient echo sequence with segmented outer k-space sampling and view-sharing/Dixon image reconstruction (DISCO, DIfferential Subsampling with Cartesian Ordering) was chosen as a starting point due to its high temporal resolution. It was then modified to enable respiratory triggering while maintaining temporal resolution of one temporal frame every one to two respirations, with segments of k-space only acquired in the expiratory phase of respiration. Imaging parameters were: 12\u00b0flip angle, \u00b1 167 kHz bandwidth, TR~3.56, matrix 256x200, FOV 28-34 cm, slice thickness 4 mm, and 2x2 spatial acceleration. With IRB approval and informed patient consent 9 consecutive patients referred for MRI renal function evaluation were recruited (age range; 0.5 to 9.6 years, mean\u00b1SD: 3.99\u00b13.6 years; males 78% females 22%), and scanned on a GE 3 T MR using a 32-channel torso array with the respiratory-triggered high spatiotemporal resolution technique to extract regional GFR maps. Two readers by consensus assessed image qualitative SNR, motion artifacts and volumetric fat-water suppression performance. Results: Data acquisition was obtained to completion in all subjects without triggering failure. Temporal resolution was approximately 12 s for two respiratory cycles. No case had major fat suppression failure, whereas minor fat suppression failure was seen in 11% (95% C.I. 0 to 37%). All cases had diagnostically acceptable SNR. No motion artifacts were noted in 7/9 cases, while some artifacts with ghosting in 2/9 cases. Regional GFR maps could be successfully extracted for each patient without the need for image registration. Attached figure shows image quality. Conclusions: View-sharing offsets loss of temporal resolution from respiratory triggering. Thus, high spatiotemporal resolution renal dynamic contrast enhanced respiratory triggered images can be obtained with minimal motion artifacts in a pediatric clinical setting to evaluate renal function.

Methods & Materials: The study cohort was selected from the IRB approved Children's Oncology Group AREN03B2 study. Cases are evaluated for pre-operative WT rupture based on central review of surgical/pathology findings. 70 WT cases with rupture were matched to 70 WT controls by age and tumor weight (within 6 months and 50 g). CT scans were independently reviewed by 2 blinded radiologists, for presence/absence of rupture and the following CT signs: poorly circumscribed mass, perinephric fat stranding, peritumoral fat planes obscured, retroperitoneal fluid, ascites beyond cul-de-sac, peritoneal implants, ipsilateral pleural effusion, intratumor hemorrhage. Sensitivity, specificity of CT for assessing pre-operative WT rupture was determined. The relationship between CT signs and rupture was assessed by McNemar's test, and the most predictive CT signs determined by backward selection multivariate logistic regression. Results: Sensitivity, specificity for detecting WT rupture were: reviewer 1-53.7%, 88.4%, reviewer 2-70.2%, 88.4%. Kappa coefficient for interobserver agreement was substantial: 0.76 (p<0.0001). All CT signs tested, except peritoneal implants and intratumoral hemorrhage, had significant association with tumor rupture (p<0.01). For reviewer 1, ascites and fat stranding around tumor were most predictive (Odds ratio 18.359 and 10.554, P<0.01). For reviewer 2, ascites and retroperitoneal fluid were most predictive (OR 8.345 and 4.916, P<0.01).",

From this group, 16 children had follow-up surgical intervention with repeat pyeloplasty or balloon dilatation of the UPJ. Imaging features reviewed included degree of hydronephrosis, calyceal transit times, renal transit times, signal intensity versus time curves, as well as functional analysis based on volumetric and Patlak differential function and change in the asymmetry index. Results: All children who underwent a second surgical procedure had delayed calyceal transit times. The degree of hydronephrosis and renal transit times were either stable or worse when compared to pre-operative evaluation. Functional derangement could show stability, slight improvement or deterioration. The asymmetry index estimated the severity of the obstruction. Conclusions: MR urography is valuable in the evaluation of children who have undergone pyeloplasty. The calyceal transit time appears to be the most reliable discriminator when comparing successful and failed pyeloplasty. Calyceal transit times may be prolonged before the hydronephrosis becomes progressive.

The fMRU studies were carried out according to a standard protocol and post-processing using the CHOP-fMRU software. This included IV hydration, bladder catheterization and IV Furosemide administration. Fifteen minutes after diuretic administration, a dynamic coronal 3D fat saturated T1 sequence was performed in a supine position over 15 min. A sagittal 3D T1 and delayed single coronal T1, both fat saturated, followed in a supine and/or prone position. The following functional features were evaluated: visualization of the ureter, the presence of a contrast-urine level and swirling of contrast in the dilated renal pelvis. The functional results included in the analysis were calyceal transit time (CTT), renal transit time (RTT), time-to-peak (TTP), parenchymal volume (PV), differential renal functions (volumetric-vDRF, Patlak-pDRF and volumetric Patlak-vpDRF) and the difference between vDRF and pDRF. Results: 16 patients were comprised of 8 males and 8 females with an age range of 0.1-17.0 years (median 0.8 yrs). Of the kidneys with PCD, the ureter was visualized in 10, 3 during the dynamic sequence, 4/9 during supine delay and 3/7 only in prone position. A contrast-urine level was present in 14 of the dilated systems, and swirling in 6. The ureter was visualized during dynamic sequence in all contralateral normal kidneys and at no time was swirling or a contrast-urine level identified. The average functional parameters are seen in Table 1 . A statistically significant (p<0.05) difference between the normal and dilated pelvicalyceal systems was achieved in TTP, pDRF and vpDRF for this small sample size. Conclusions: Awareness of multiple functional features and the range of calculated results may aid in subsequent combined interpretation of the fMRU with the morphologic analysis.

Demographics, clinical presentation , diagnostic studies and treatment outcomes were evaluated. Post-procedure imaging was evaluated for clot burden reduction (patency) and residual venous stenosis by two-reader consensus. Results: Ten patients (5 male; 5 female, mean age 16 years, range 15-18) presenting with acute upper extremity swelling and pre-procedure imaging revealing 100% occlusion of the axillary and subclavian veins received successful endovascular therapy. All 10 patients underwent infusion catheter placement for thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase. 6 patients received additional pharmacomechanical treatment. Angioplasty was also performed in all patients. The mean treatment duration was 33 h (range 16-62). Post-procedural imaging revealed that 9 of 10 patients achieved 75-100% patency (clot burden reduction) and 1 patient achieved 50-75% patency. The residual venous stenosis was graded: 5 patients had 0-25% stenosis, 2 patients had 25-50% stenosis and 3 patients had 75-100% stenosis. All patients were discharged on full anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin. 9 patients had surgical rib resection postthrombolysis with an average length of time from thrombolytic therapy to surgery being 32 days (range 14-73). 3 patients had re-thrombosis events during the follow-up period (mean 10 months; range 1-34), with one re-thrombosis event occurring within one week of thrombolytic therapy, prior to surgery and the other two occurring 3-5 weeks post-rib resection. There were no procedure related complications. One patient was lost to follow-up after initial successful catheter directed therapy. Conclusions: Percutaneous endovascular techniques such as pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and angioplasty appear to be feasible and safe options for Paget Schroetter Syndrome in otherwise healthy adolescent patients. In attempt to prevent rethrombosis and chronic symptoms, we refer all patients for adjunctive surgical decompression. Future larger studies are needed to address optimal strategies for these patients.",

Racadio, Drazenko Babic, Ross Schierling, Jasmine Hales, Benno Hendriks Purpose or Case Report: To investigate the feasibility and potential of real-time tissue characterization at the tip of a needle with diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) sensing capabilities during 3D fluoroscopy guidance using cone beam CT and dedicated needle path planning software. Methods & Materials: A C-arm X-ray system that combines fluoroscopy and 3D imaging from a cone beam CT was used to image a woodchuck with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The imaging system enabled needle path planning, which was used to perform insertion and navigation of a needle toward the liver tumor. The needle was integrated with optical fibers for real-time tissue spectral sensing at its tip. Optical spectra measurements were obtained continuously as the needle passed through healthy liver tissue and then into the tumor. From the diffuse optical spectra measurements, the following clinical parameters were extracted for tissue characterization: blood volume fraction, blood oxygenation, lipid volume fraction and tissue light scattering (related to tissue density). The tissue parameters were compared for healthy liver and tumor using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: The tissue density of the healthy liver was lower than that of the tumor. Higher blood and lipid volume fractions as well as oxygenation levels were observed in the healthy liver as compared to the tumor. All differences were statistically significant (P<0.01). Additionally, a much wider heterogeneity in tissue density was observed in the tumor as opposed to the healthy liver. Conclusions: Differences in tissue properties between tumor and healthy liver enable discrimination between these two types of tissues. Adding real-time optical sensing at the tip of a needle to 3D fluoroscopy image guidance is a feasible technique that complements the imaging information with relevant physiological parameters; it facilitates more precise definition of tumor boundaries despite any target motion during needle insertion.

Methods & Materials: Two children aged 6 months and 3 months were treated at this institution for liver failure resulting from urea cycle disorders, with a hepatocyte transplant procedure. The recipient liver was irradiated prior to transplant to facilitate engraftment. The procedure involves the injection of prepared hepatocytes from a suitably screened, compatible donor, via a main portal vein branch into the recipient liver. In both procedures access to the umbilical vein was achieved by the surgery service and a 4 French arterial sheath was placed. A 4 French angled catheter was used for diagnostic runs and to access the right and left main portal vein. A 3 French Fogarty catheter (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Ca) was placed to isolate each portal vein branch in turn and hepatocytes injected using hand injections. Pressures in the main, right and left portal veins were measured and hand injections of contrast made at regular intervals. Careful attention must be paid for evidence of pruning of portal branches, indicating occlusion of small portal branches, or portal to hepatic vein shunting. If shunting is seen, infusion must be stopped as embolism of hepatocytes into pulmonary arteries may result with serious clinical sequelae Results: In both patients, the desired number of hepatocytes were successfully delivered into the recipient liver. In both cases, mild pruning of the portal vein branches was evident at the end of the procedure. Portal vein presssures remained steady. There was no venographic or clinical evidence of pulmonary arterial embolization. Conclusions: The interventional radiologist plays a central role in the hepatocyte transplant procedure. Familiarity with catheterizing portal branches from an umbilical vein approach, measuring venous pressures, using small occlusion catheters and recognizing venographic end points such as portal vein pruning and portal to hepatic vein shunting are necessary to the safe and successful completion of this new technique. Purpose or Case Report: The aim of the study was to evaluate the trends in term of type of tube placed, number of procedures per year, number and age of the patients as well as the number of procedures per patient and the interval of time between two placements, and finally the irradiation burden borne by the patients. Methods & Materials: After REB approval the radiologic files of the patients who underwent naso-duodenal-jejunal (NDJ) or gastro-jejunal (GJ) or jejunal (J) tube placement under fluoroscopy over the past five years (2006 to 2010) were extracted from the RIS and reviewed. The results were tabulated as a single batch and stratified by year. Results: Eighty-nine patients representing 234 procedures (155 NDJ, 77, GJ, 2 J) were included. Only 38 patients underwent a single procedure. The average number of procedures per patient was 2.6 with a maximum of 12 during the study period. The average patient's age was 55.3 months (SD074.88, median0 11.43). The average fluoro time per procedure was 7.2 min (SD08.3, median05.0). The average interval between two procedures was 58 days (SD0108,44, median018). The average fluoroscopy time per patient combining those having a single procedure and those having multiple ones, was 19.57 min (range 0.3 to 151.7, SD024.36, median012.45). Conclusions: Fluoroscopic placement of enteric tubes delivers a significant amount of irradiation. Our data led to two interventions with respect to insertion and management of the tubes. On one hand, when the attempt pursued by a radiologist is not successful after 10 min of fluoroscopy other strategies should be considered including another operator or an alternative technique for tube positioning. On the other hand, information will be distributed toward the clinicians and nurses in order to improve the management of these tubes and avoid fortuitous displacement which was responsible of a significant amount of repeated procedures leading to undue irradiation. Purpose or Case Report: To evaluate drug elution pharmacodynamics of doxycycline in an albumin-based solution, as used in percutaneous imaging-directed therapy of aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) and microcystic lymphatic malformation (LM) Methods & Materials: Doxycycline mixed with 25% human serum albumin (HSA), and doxycycline mixed with saline solution (both 20 mg/ml) were evaluated using a fluid diffusion chamber system over 8 h, recording pH and doxycycline concentration. Static pH and doxycycline concentrations were recorded every 5 min for the first 180 min, then every 30 min for a total of 8 h, averaged over 3 trials in each of the HSA and saline systems. Statistical analysis evaluated standard deviation and rate of change for the 3 trials in each system. Drug elution dynamics data were correlated with clinical experience in the doxycycline/albumin treatment of 49 patients (233 treatments) with aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) and 63 patients with 1263 lymphatic malformation microcysts. Results: Drug elution was linear in both the HSA and saline systems, with statistically significant (p<.001) slower elution drug release from the albumin system as compared with the doxycycline and saline solution, both over 3 and 8 h. Purpose or Case Report: To describe a successful Interventional Radiologic approach to the management of Paget Schroetter Syndrome presenting as acute arm swelling in adolecent athletes. Methods & Materials: Institutional Review board approval was obtained for this retrospective study. Five patients aged 14 to 18 years (mean 16.5 years) were treated at this Institution over a 2 year period all presenting with acute arm swelling (July 2009 -July 2011). Ultrasound confirmed subclavian vein thrombosis in all cases. All were treated with placement of an infusion catheter (EV3, Plymouth, MN), infusion of Tissue plasminogen Activator (TPA) at a rate of 1 mg/hour overnight and aspiration of remaining clot with a \"Trellis\" (Bacchus Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) thrombectomy device. Results: Clot was successfully removed in all five patients. Complete clearance of clot was confirmed by contrarst venography in all cases. In four patients balloon angioplasty of a narrrowing at the junction of the subclavian and brachiocephalic veins was carried out. In one, the thrombus recurred within 6 h. The patient was retreated the next day with aspiration of clot using the \"Trellis\" device and an infusion catheter placed with low dose (0.5mgs/hour) TPA commenced until surgical review; this patient was operated on within 48 h of final thrombolysis. All patients were seen by a Vascular Surgeon with an interest in this condition. All underwent surgical decompression; at end of the study period all patients were asymptomatic. Conclusions: Interventional Radiologic management of acute axillo-subclavian thrombosis due to Paget Schroetter syndrome is safe and highly successful in the adolescent population. Early recurrence of thrombus is not uncommon and prompt surgical consultation with a view to early surgical decompression is recommended. Purpose or Case Report: Diagnostic reference levels (DRL) or target radiation dose ranges for pediatric CT scans are needed in the U.S. The first U.S. pediatric CT dose index registry (QuIRCC) within the American College of Radiology recorded estimates of patient radiation dose using a new method (SSDE) based on body width(BW) for the purpose of developing Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRL). In addition to developing DRL at the 75th percentile, the purpose of this study was to determine the SSDEs associated with the lower range of acceptable image quality through subjective image quality evaluation.",

From 939 exams, each site submitted de-identified images for selected cases based on SSDE and patient width. A total of 106 cases were selected from the lowest, first quartile and median SSDE. Six investigators reviewed 3 images from each case under identical viewing conditions and rated them for subjective quality according to a score sheet and reference scale of images with known quantum mottle. Cases were considered non-diagnostic if at least 3 of 6 reviewers ranked them as such. Results: First, second, and third quartile SSDE and CTDI-vol32 values from 6 sites for each BW will be shown. 6/ 106 cases were ranked non-diagnostic by the reviewers. 4/6 non-diagnostic cases were below the 10th percentile based on SSDE. 5/6 of \"non-diagnostic\" cases had SSDE less than the 25th percentile. The unacceptable case with SSDE above the 25th percentile (16 cm, SSDE 8.2 mGy) was due to subcutaneous metal implant with artifact. The QuIRCC 75th percentile using CTDIvol 32 for a 5 yr old is 7.1 mGy which is 30% lower than the ACR CT accreditation data's published 75th percentile. Conclusions: This consortium developed target dose ranges (DRLs) for CT of the abdomen with IV contrast for routine exam indications based on evaluation of image quality that establish lower and upper ranges (25-75 percentile) of patient dose(using SSDE) associated with clinically acceptable images. This study demonstrates that pediatric radiologists in this consortium are comfortable interpreting images at or above the 25 percentile SSDE and judged all but one image within this target range as diagnostically acceptable. Table 1 ). With the exception of neonate chest, most used age-based techniques; only two centers reported using thickness. No survey used grids for wrist images, while 2/3 of the surveys used grids for chest and abdomen exams in 5-year-olds. At the most common SID there was up to a 60 kVp variation (5year-old chest AP) and up to 8-fold variation in mAs (13 year old Scoli Lat). Only two surveys used equipment that displayed the new IEC exposure index. Conclusions: Participants report variability in the techniques and methods used to acquire common radiographic studies, reflecting differences between detector types and users. Radiologists, technologists, medical physicists, manufacturers, and the FDA have an opportunity to work together to standardize the techniques based on detector type to optimize radiation exposure for pediatric radiographic exams.

CTDIvol and greatest lateral dimension were recorded from each scan and were used to calculate SSDE. Mean SSDE from community scans was compared to mean SSDE from children's hospital groups A and B. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t-test. Results: Patient age range was 0-17 years in both community and children's hospital groups. Mean SSDE for community C, AP, and CAP scans was 1.7, 1.3, and 1.6 times higher than mean SSDE for matched scans in control group A (p<0.001) and 5.0, 2.8, and 3.7 times higher than mean SSDE for matched scans in control group B (p<0.0001). Conclusions: SSDE was significantly higher for community pediatric body CT scans than for matched scans performed at a children's hospital that adheres to Image Gently Campaign principles. Results suggest that more community outreach and education are required in implementation of low-dose CT protocols outside of children's hospitals. Concurrent use of IR provides a means of achieving even greater SSDE reduction than is possible with FBP alone and should be encouraged.",

            "text": "We performed 256 MDCT scans of 10, 20, 25, and 35 cm CWP. Thirty scans were performed for each phantom. The tube currents ranged from 50 to 500 mAs with increments of 50 mAs, and the tube voltage levels were 80, 100, and 120 kVp. The noise (standard deviation in HU) was measured using center region of interest (ROI) that was 80% of phantom's area. Two other ROIs (each 2% of the area) were placed at the center and periphery of the phantom images to measure noise gradient. Results: In the smallest (10 cm) CWP, approximately the same noise level was maintained with all three tube voltages without a significant change in CTDIvol. For the 20, 25, and 35 cm phantoms, the average CTDIvol needed to be increased by 2%, 4%, and 19%, respectively, to maintain same noise level when the voltage was decreased from 120 to 100 kVp. The average CTDIvol needed to be increased by 15%, 22% and 52% to maintain the same noise level in the 20, 25, and 35 cm CWP when the tube voltage was decreased from 120 to 80 kVp. The difference between central and peripheral noise increased on average by 11.1%, 19.6%, 23.7%, and 28.0% in the CWP of 10, 20, 25, and 35 cm, respectively. In each CWP, the central to peripheral noise difference was more pronounced (up to 3.7% more) with decrease in kVp from 120 to 100 or 80. Conclusions: Noise measurements in the water phantom model indicate that tube voltage could be decreased from 120 to 80 in CWP of 10 cm without significant change in CTDIvol. It is also possible to decrease the voltage from 120 to 100 kVp with a minimal (< average 5%) increase in dose in CWPs of 10, 20, and 25 cm. The noise gradient increases with larger CWP and smaller kVp.",

Podberesky, Erin Angels, Terry T. Yoshizumi, Greta Toncheva, Donald P. Frush Purpose or Case Report: To compare effective dose (ED) estimates, image noise, and scan duration for pediatric chest, abdomen and pelvis protocols using 320-row and 64-row CT scanners in various acquisition modes. Methods & Materials: Organ doses were measured using 20 MOSFET dosimeters. Dose, scan duration, and noise measurements were made in a 5-year-old anthropomorphic phantom for conventional helical, 160-detector helical and volume acquisition modes for chest, abdomen and pelvis protocols on a 320-row CT, and for helical mode on a 64row CT (Aquilion ONE and Aquilion 64, Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan) using similar scan parameters representing currently used clinical protocols. Mean organ doses from three runs for each protocol, in combination with ICRP 103 tissue weighting factors, were used to obtain ED for each protocol. Noise was measured as the standard deviation of Hounsfield units in 3 equivalent locations at 4 levels for each protocol with an ROI tool. ED and noise were compared with a paired T-test or sign test. Results: Compared to helical acquisitions on the 64-row CT, ED of all tested acquisition modes on the 320-row volume CT were significantly lower for chest, abdomen/pelvis (AP) and chest/abdomen/pelvis (CAP) protocols (Table) . Scan durations were lower across the board on the 320-row volume CT. Compared to acquisitions on the 64-row CT, noise was in general similar to those on 320-row CT protocols, but some acquisition protocols on the 320-row CT produced greater noise (Table) , specifically volume acquisition for chest CT and 160-detector helical and volume modes for AP and CAP protocols. Conclusions: Dose savings can be achieved for chest, AP and CAP CT examinations on a 320-row CT scanner compared to helical acquisition on a 64-row CT, with shorter scan durations. Image noise was in general comparable between protocols. Although noise differences between some modes did reach statistical significance, the impact on overall image quality will need to be studied further.",

Our aim was to investigate the relationship between O:E TFLV and short-and long-term morbidity outcomes in surviving infants with CDH. Methods & Materials: A retrospective analysis of cases of isolated left-side CDH referred to our institution for fetal MR evaluation between 24-35 weeks. MR imaging studies were performed on a 1.5 T Philips system using a phased array body coil. The observed TFLV was calculated by multiplying the summed area of the region of interest by the section thickness. The expected TFLV was calculated with a formula previously described in the literature using the gestational age of the fetus. The observed TFLV was expressed as a percentage of the expected TFLV at a given gestation. Morbidity outcome data was obtained from the case records of all surviving infants. Specific measures of illness severity relating to short-term intensive care management and long-term outpatient management were recorded. Differences in O:E TFLV between outcome groups were assessed by t-test. Results: 18 liveborn infants with isolated left-side CDH and antenatal MR scans were identified. Scans were performed at 24-35 weeks gestation. 12 infants survived to discharge; gestation 38.5 (36.0 -39) weeks, birth weight 3.17 (2.03-3.66) kg. Median length of admission was 38 (23-103) days, median duration of follow-up was 3.1 (0.7-5.4) years. O:E TFLV was significantly lower in non-surviving infants; 23 vs. 37%, P0 0.005. O:E TFLV was significantly lower in infants who received High Frequency Oscillation Ventilation (HFOV) versus those who were conventionally ventilated (29% vs 41%, P00.05). O:E TFLV was also significantly lower in those infants who had a length of admission greater than the median of 38 days (29% vs. 43%, P00.02). O:E TFLV trended lower with other measures of increased morbidity; inhaled nitric oxide use, patch repair of diaphragm, rehospitalisation within 1 year, supplemental feeding at discharge, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and developmental delay. Conclusions: As well as predicting survival, lung volume measurement by O:E TFLV is a promising predictor of outcome and morbidity in surviving infants with CDH. Further studies in larger populations are required to provide quantitative predictive risk data.",

The scanner has a maximum patient bore diameter of 21.8 cm (without RF coil), and roughly twice the gradient performance of the best conventional adult whole-body 1.5 T MR systems.

A Br\u00fcel & Kjaer model 2250 sound level meter (Br\u00fcel & Kjaer Sound & Vibration Measurement A/S, Denmark) was used to perform the SPL measurements for 6 several different MR acquisitions (spin echo, gradient echo, fast RF spoiled gradient echo, fully balanced steady state free precession, gradient echo echo planar, and diffusion weighted) using acquisition parameters consistent with clinical protocols. The MR sequences, acquisition parameters, noise measurement equipment and methodology were identical for the two MR systems. The maximum SPL in units of A weighted decibels (dBA) was recorded for each of the MR acquisition/MR system combinations evaluated. Results: The maximum SPL values measured during each of the 6 MR acquisitions were lower for all sequences (average 11.33dBA (range05-18dBA)) for the NICU MRI unit as compared to the conventional MRI scanner ( Table 1 ). The average measured maximum SPL value, reported in dBA, across all 6 acquisitions was 86.2\u00b12.6 for the NICU scanner, and 97.5\u00b12.9 for the conventional MRI scanner. The highest SPL values were measured for the diffusion-weighted sequence: 85 and 103dbA, for the NICU and conventional MRI scanner respectively. Conclusions: Because of the smaller dimensions of the gradient coils in the NICU MRI system, acoustic noise is less than that of conventional MRI scanners despite the superior gradient performance of the smaller coils. The lower inherent acoustic noise level of the NICU system provides improved safety for the neonate, and facilitates siting of the unit in the NICU.

Persistence of germinal matrix and immature neurovascular autonomic regulation in the premature neonate is thought to predispose to GMH. Most GMH in premature population occurs during the first 4 days of life, and yet the persistence of the germinal matrix to 32 weeks gestation may allow for post-natal GMH outside of the immediate perinatal period.

The study population included 150 infants who had a head ultrasound (HUS) within the first week of life and at least one follow HUS after the first week of life. All HUS were reviewed by three experienced pediatric radiologists for the presence and grade of ICH or late developing hemorrhagelike lesions (HLL). Infants with and without HLL were evaluated for several clinical variables, including neurodevelopmental outcomes (Bayley scales). Results: Average gestational age of study population was 25.1 weeks. The incidence of GMH in the first week of life was 34% Grade 1, 38.6% Grade 2, 4.9% grade 3/ 4, and 2.2% posterior fossa. New echogenic foci (HLL) at the caudothalamic groove were seen in 13.3% after the first week of life. 70% of these lesions were bilateral. A four-fold increase in incidence of HLL was seen in infants <750 g compared to those> 750 g. Higher grade hemorrhages were not seen in this patient population, although 6% of infants had late posterior fossa hemorrhages. The clinical course of infants with HLL trended towards a higher incidence of stressors, but this was not statistically significant. The Psychomotor Development Index scores were lower than those infants without hemorrhage. Conclusions: Small HLL at the caudothalamic groove are common in extremely preterm infants after the first week of life. Higher grade (2-4) hemorrhages were not seen. There were no cases of intraventricular extension and no direct complications. If isolated, this finding necessitates no follow-up imaging, but may be associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Disclosure: Dr. Guevara has indicated that he will discuss or describe, in the educational content, a use of a medical device or pharmaceutical that is classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as investigational for intended use. Purpose or Case Report: TOF/APV is a rare congenital heart lesion in which pulmonary arteries may become aneurysmally dilated and compress adjacent airways. Pulmonary arterioplasty is often required to relieve tracheobronchial compression in addition to intracardiac repair. The purpose of this study was to review pre and postnatal imaging findings and their impact on patient management and clinical course. Methods & Materials: A retrospective database search identified 9 infants with TOF/APV between 2005-2011 (4 fetal diagnosed cases and 5 diagnosed postnatally). For FDC, prenatal ultrasound (US) and fetal MRI were correlated with postnatal CT for the size of the central pulmonary arteries, airway compression, and presence / distribution of air trapping/atelectasis. For all cases postnatal CT findings (between 3-9 days of age) were correlated with clinical management and outcome. Results: Prenatal diagnosis of TOF/APV was suggested sonographically, based on dilated central PAs, between 21-28 weeks gestational age (GA). Fetal MRI, performed between 32-37 weeks GA confirmed the diagnosis and aneurysmal central PAs and demonstrated air trapping &/or atelectasis in 3/4 with normal appearing lungs in 1 fetus. Size of the PAs (4/4) and presence and distribution of lung abnormality (3/4) correlated closely between fetal MRI and postnatal CT, although detailed visualization of the central airway/ vascular relationships were better defined on CT. Fetal MRI identified an unexpected diaphragmatic hernia (DH) not seen on US. For the PND cases, CT showed aneurysmal PAs and airway compression with air trapping &/or atelectasis in 4/5 infants. Seven infants with airway obstruction on CT required pulmonary arterioplasty; 1 infant with no air trapping did not have arterioplasty. 7/8 operative patients survived, one with concomitant DH died at age 22 days due to hemorrhagic shock. One FDC was inoperable due to poor cardiac function and died at age 7 days. Conclusions: Prenatal MRI correlates well with postnatal CT for assessing pulmonary artery size and location and severity of lung abnormality in patients with TOF/APV, this allows for appropriate management planning and may negate the need for an immediate postnatal CT. CT accurately depicts the location and extent of airway compression and resultant air trapping or atelectasis, serving to guide the need for and extent of the arterioplasty procedure.",

Results: 5/6 cases were correctly diagnosed prenatally. In the second trimester findings may be subtle, with mild calvarial changes; digit abnormalities, in particular, may elude the imager in unsuspected cases. Although the diagnosis could be made with either modality, the full spectrum of abnormalities was best appreciated using a combined imaging approach of MRI and US. By US many salient features were depicted: Turribrachycephaly/trigonocephaly/cloverleaf (6/6); Syndactyly (4/4); Polydactyly (1/1). Agenesis of the corpus callosum was identified by US in (2/2) cases. Conversely, MRI, performed in all cases, contributed additional observations not well seen by US: the fetal airway was well delineated in all cases (6/6); a low lying spinal cord was noted (1/1), midface hypoplasia (6/6) and migrational/sulcation abnormality (1/1). Additional findings of absent ductus venosus with biliary atresia (1/1), abdominal wall defect (1/1) and renal anomalies (1/1) were seen with both modalities. Reimaging in later pregnancy depicted important changes (2/2), including worsening hydrocephalus and resolution of suspected airway occlusion. Conclusions: US and MRI are complementary modalities in evaluating fetuses with craniosynostosis. Airway patency, midface hypoplasia, spinal cord abnormalities and intracranial abnormalities are often better seen with MRI. Fetal activity, digits, bone detail, and cardiac anomalies are better appreciated by US. Findings may be subtle in the second trimester.

Animals were induced with arthritis and subsequently given intravenous hyperpolarized 13 C-pyruvate, and imaged. The amount of 13 C-lactate produced from pyruvate in normal and arthritic joints was measured both at single points in time and dynamically at either 3 or 14 Tesla. The 13 C-MRSI data were compared with clinical measures of arthritis, cell stimulation studies, and joint changes on conventional anatomic MRI and histology. Results: Alterations in lactate production as measured by 13 C-MRSI appear to depict sites of arthritis and correlate with other more established but potentially less reliable or more invasive measures of disease status. Imaging robust mouse models of pediatric disease may be feasible at 14 Telsa. This method may also be translated from high-field to clinical equipment with reasonable hardware and software modifications that allow detection of hyperpolarized 13 C compounds. 13 C-MRSI depicts increased lactate production at specific regions of inflammation within arthritic joints and is confirmed by histological inspection and anatomic MRI. On average, lactate production is increased by 60% in areas affected by inflammation. Conclusions: The intravenous injection of hyperpolarized carbon-13 compounds and subsequent imaging with 13 C-MRSI provides a unique molecular imaging strategy to noninvasively monitor pediatric disease. This non-invasive imaging strategy may eventually provide clinical utility for several pediatric diseases involving inflammation, infection and tumor.

Methods & Materials: Using the Hemangioma-Vascular Malformation Clinic registry at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, we searched for patients diagnosed with KHE whose evaluation included MRI. Twenty such patients were found, although three of the patients had no pre-therapy MRIs. The imaging studies were reviewed by the authors with assessment of the following characteristics: location, margin definition, soft tissue involvement, and pre and post contrast signal intensity. Results: Location: Lesion location was as follows: trunk (9), extremity (3), extremity plus trunk (3), and head/neck (2). Signal: All lesions were dark on T1 weighted sequences with diffuse enhancement after contrast administration. The majority of the lesions were bright on T2 weighted sequences, but there were 3 cases that had heterogenous to low T2 signal (with all involving the retroperitoneum). Of the 17 cases, only one had both high arterial and venous flow by MRI. Margin definition: Four of the lesions had well defined borders (greater than 50% well circumscribed) with minimal to no adjacent infiltration/edema. Two of those four cases were exophytic masses. The remaining 13 cases were poorly defined lesions with adjacent infiltrative fluid signal intensity and enhancement. Tissue/Organ involvement: Tissue/organ involvement was counted if abnormal fluid-signal intensity or enhancement was identified at that site. Review of these cases showed fifteen patients with muscular involvement. Dermal and subcutaneous involvement was observed in all but 4 cases, with the uninvolved lesions being isolated and deep. Additional sites of suspected involvement included bone (3), pleura (1), penis (1), and pancreas (2). Conclusions: KHE is a rare neoplasm of infancy with a spectrum of features by MRI. Poorly defined lesions are much more frequent than well-circumscribed masses. However, pathologic correlation of such infiltrative margins is usually not available as treatments after biopsy are primarily medical rather than surgical. Common additional MRI features include predominant involvement of muscle, subcutaneous fat, and skin over viscera and bone with lesions generally showing increased T2 signal and enhancement.",

Pediatric oncology patients, ages between 0-21, with known solid malignant tumors who were referred to PET-CT and standard chest CT within 30 days for staging or assessment of treatment response between 01-2008 and 01-2011 were eligible for this retrospective study. Radiology reports were reviewed for potential discrepancies. Two radiologists re-evaluated the standard chest CT and low dose chest CT portion of the PET CT of the discordant cases, while comparing with the most recent prior studies.

            "text": "Results: 120 (57 female, 63 male) patients were identified. 31 radiologic reports of 16 different patients (8 female, 8 male) had potential discrepancies based on review of the reports. The primary tumors were rhabdomyosarcoma (n0 6), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n 03) and others (n 07). Reevaluation of the original images showed true discrepancies in 3.3% (4/ total 120). In 2 studies, the discrepancy had no clinical significance. In 2 studies, a pulmonary nodule was identified on standard chest CT which was not described on the PET-CT. Both of these patients had rhabdomyosarcoma. One of these patients had findings that pediatric oncologists considered significant enough to alter patient management. Conclusions: We found a low false negative rate for clinically significant findings on the low dose portion of PET-CT as compared to standard chest CT. In the future, improvements in acquisition technique and post processing of the CT portion of the PET-CT may further improve its diagnostic utility, obviating the need for a routine separate diagnostic CT, thereby minimizing radiation exposure in these young patients. Methods & Materials: 98 low-dose CTA examinations were performed in pediatric patients over a three year period to evaluate suspected vascular traumatic injury with some patients receiving scans of more than one area of the body. Areas scanned in this include the head and/or neck (N054), chest (N017), abdomen and/or pelvis (N013), upper extremity (N08) and lower extremity (N017). In 80 of these patients, suspected vascular injury was due to a history of either blunt (N 041) or penetrating (N 039) trauma. 64 patients were referred directly from the emergency department, while 27 were inpatients and the remaining 7 were referred from an outpatient setting. Patients (32 F:66 M) ranged in age from 0 to 23 years old (mean age 11). Studies were performed on a 64-channel MDCT scanner with 80 or 100 kV, 40 to 200mAs, 1.0 to 1.5 mm section thickness, reconstructed with 50% overlap, and 0.8 to 1.5 pitch. Contrast medium was power-injected using weight-based protocols to optimize iodine delivery. Exams were interpreted on a workstation using advanced imaging techniques. Patient radiation dose was calculated in all cases. Clinical outcome was assessed through a 6 month follow-up when possible. Results: All studies were technically adequate. 76.5% (N078) of studies revealed no vascular injury, while 23.5% (N023) revealed acute vascular pathology. Vascular injuries included vascular occlusion (N012), vasospasm (N03), narrowing/dissection (N04), pseudoaneurysm (N02), and transection (N0 1). Extravascular traumatic findings were demonstrated in 51.0% (N050), including fractures, lung injury, soft tissue hematomas, and a ruptured Baker's cyst. Of the patients with acute vascular findings, 43.4% (N010) underwent surgical management (including 6 for vascular injury), while 52.1% (N012) were managed conservatively. One patient with active extravasation was managed with angiographically-guided embolization. In no case was catheter angiography required to confirm CTA findings. Conclusions: Low dose CTA is a reliable means to screen pediatric patients emergently for acute vascular injury. Vascular and non-vascular pathology can be diagnosed noninvasively for efficient patient management.",

ARFI velocity measuring was performed by 4-9 MHz linear probe for children under 5 years old and 1-4 MHz convex probe for older children. ARFI velocity was measured three times at each organ. However this measurement was stopped if the child cannot tolerate. Results: Two hundred two children (M:F092:110; mean age, 8\u00b14.7 years) were enrolled. And ARFI measurement was performed only two time for some organs in three children. The mean ARFI value was 1.12\u00b10.20 m/s in liver, 2.20\u00b10.49 m/s in right kidney, 2.33\u00b10.53 m/s in left kidney, and 2.25 \u00b1 0.41 m/s in spleen. ARFI velocity was not different between boys and girls. However, ARFI velocity was different between right and left kidneys (p00.001). The ARFI value of right kidney, left kidney and spleen was correlated with age, height, weight and BMI (p<0.001). However, the ARFI value of liver was not correlated with these parameters. Conclusions: ARFI measurement is feasible in children with only three times acquisition for each abdominal organ. The mean ARFI velocity was increased according to the age, height, weight and BMI in kidney and spleen, but it was constant in liver.

Purpose or Case Report: Diagnostic image quality can be achieved over a wide range of radiation exposure in digital radiography. \"Exposure Factor Creep\" or \"Dose Creep'\" in which technologists tend to increase dose to avoid the appearance of noise has been well described. Using the ALARA principle, acceptable images can be achieved while minimizing dose. At our institution \"dose creep\" has been observed in bedside pediatric chest radiography. To address this we coupled a data mining tool with a continuous quality improvement (CQI) initiative which educates individual technologists on appropriate technique. Methods & Materials: Radiation dose in digital radiography is estimated from an exposure index, a proprietary format that varies among manufacturers. Our institution uses a Fuji Computed Radiography system which calculates an S, or Sensitivity value, that provides an approximation of the radiation dose to the imaging plate, using an inverse scale. Overexposed bedside chest radiographs were defined by a S value less than 150. A data-mining program was developed to extract from the DICOM header the S value and other relevant information, on a monthly basis. These data were used to provide training and feedback on a one-on-one-basis. Results: With ad hoc feedback and group training initiatives prior to implementation of this new system, approximately 16.7% (344/2057) of bedside chest radiographs were overexposed over a four month period. After one-on-one intervention with the technologists, preliminary findings reveal a trend towards fewer overexposed radiographs with approximately 9.2% (40/435) with S<150. Conclusions: Our tool provides a simple method for systematically identifying overexposed radiographs and the corresponding responsible technologists. We anticipate that this personalized educational program will continue to reduce the proportion of overexposed radiographs and thus the radiation dose to our pediatric patients. Purpose or Case Report: Ensuring radiation protection for children undergoing CT scans is challenging due to rapidly changing technology, differences in CT equipment and potential lack of understanding of unique aspects of scanning children. The Joint Commission has named technologists' training as an \"action\" item. We developed 8 online training modules to fill potential gaps in CT technologists' education.",

The CVICU examinations accounted for 11% of all IH and was the second most common patient location for IH, but not significantly different from other inpatient locations (p00.09).

For each scan, we recorded patient age, weight, effective mA, kVp, console CTDIvol-32 cm and DLP-32 cm (from which we calculated age-adjusted effective dose (ED)). We measured effective chest diameter \u00d8 to convert CTDI to SSDE, and we correlated SSDE with measured breast ESD, using linear regression. We evaluated image quality with regard to answering the clinical question. (Table) , due to systematic introduction of automatic exposure control, low kV and high pitch scanning techniques. All studies were of diagnostic image quality to address the clinical question. Conclusions: SSDE is a valid measure of CT dose in pediatric patients undergoing chest CTA over a wide range of scanner platforms, techniques, and patient sizes, and may be used to model breast and other organ dose, and to document results of dose reduction strategies over time. Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of this project was to create an automated system capable of quantifying slice-byslice CT image quality and radiation dose data based on patient size. The information generated from this system should enable size-specific optimization of CT scan parameters in order to obtain images of diagnostic quality at the lowest possible radiation doses. Methods & Materials: A mathematical model was developed to predict CT image noise based on kVp, effective mAs, and water-equivalent diameter of the patient. A conical water phantom was used to calibrate the model on multiple scanners and accounting for different operational modes and scan parameters, including tube voltage (kVp), tube current (effective mAs), bowtie filter, and focal spot size. A software application was created to process image data from the scout topogram and incorporate DICOM metadata from the axial images. A database and data viewing application were developed to display individual and aggregate study data. All of these systems were integrated and automated to enable real-time monitoring of image quality and radiation dose as a function of patient size. Results: Since the completion of the automated system, 565 CT exams have been processed. A search application allows the user to find an individual study or a collection of studies based on parameters such as body part imaged or study protocol. The viewing application displays slice-by-slice patient diameter, radiation dose, and image quality for each study. Radiation dose estimates are adjusted for patient size, yielding size-specific dose estimates. The application also graphs individual study data compared to those of comparative studies that are included in the search. Conclusions: We have successfully developed an automated system that monitors CT image quality and radiation dose data based on patient size. The system enables simultaneous real-time monitoring of all studies performed on all CT scanners at our institution. Specifically, the system enables size-specific radiation dose estimates at every scan level. This system will be used to guide protocol adjustments in order to optimize CT image quality and thus optimize radiation dose.",

Recorded values included patient width(cm) from an axial image at the level of the splenic vein, patient age (yrs) and patient weight (lbs). A regression model for predicting patient width as a function of age and weight was determined. Results: 939 exams, 472 had all 3 measurements. Both age and weight were significant predictors of patient width (p<.0001). There was also a significant interaction between weight and age (p<.0001), indicating that the relationship between patient width and weight depended on the age of the patient. The R2 for the regression model for predicting patient width from age and weight individually were 0.65 and 0.83 respectively. The R2 for the model including both age and weight and their interaction was 0.86 leaving 14% of the variation unexplained. The regression equation for this model is: Patient width 014.1 + 0.34 x Age(yrs)+ 0.12 x Weight(lbs)-0.003 x Age x Weight. Despite the R2 of 0.86 for the model using both age and weight, the average error (RMSE) for predicting patient width compared to a direct measurement of width was 1.9 cm. The plot of observed minus predicted values (residuals) versus predicted values indicates that the best model (combination of weight and age) results in measurable errors of predicted patient width relative to direct measurement. Conclusions: A combination of both patient age and weight results in a more accurate patient width prediction than using age or weight alone. While age and weight can be used to predict body width, this is not sufficiently accurate for generating CT protocols. Therefore, direct measurement of body width form either physical measurement on the patient or from the scout view or an axial image is preferred to select appropriate scan parameters for pediatric abdominal CT.",

It is thus essential to accurately assess the risks to pediatric patients undergoing CT imaging. Current efforts to monitor radiation dose, however, are limited because they do not account for differences in risk from ionizing radiation due to variability in patient size, age, and gender. In this context, we developed an automated size-adjusted dose monitoring program capable of performing patient-specific risk estimation to facilitate protocol optimization. Methods & Materials: DICOM routing software was used to send dose reports and scout images to an image repository on a dosimetry server. Optical character recognition was used to extract dose-relevant data from dose reports; patient size was determined from corresponding scout images. Based on anatomical location, risk estimation conversion coefficients (qfactors) were determined for each series in the dose reports. The q-factors were adjusted according to patient size, age, and gender and then multiplied by the DLP to estimate the risk to each patient. This process was applied to the cohort of pediatric patients undergoing CT examination at our institution. To evaluate the impact of including patient size, age, and gender, risk estimates were obtained excluding and including the dependencies on size, age, and gender. The results were computed in units of cancer incidence per 1000 cases exposed (cpt). Results: The average patient-generic risk estimate for a pilot group of patients undergoing body CT was 0.15\u00b10.14 cpt. By including patient size, the risk estimate was increased to 0.26 cpt\u00b10.27 cpt. By including patient age and gender, the average risk estimate was further increased to 1.0 cpt\u00b10.72 cpt. Conclusions: We developed a new size-adjusted dose monitoring program for pediatric CT dosimetry. Comparisons between patient-generic and our new patient-specific risk estimates show that failure to consider patient size, age, and gender resulted in risk estimates that were too low by a factor of seven. Additionally, the increase in standard deviation we observed demonstrates that our method of including patient size, age, and gender is sensitive to the inherent variability in the patient population. Disclosure: Dr. Christianson has indicated that he will discuss or describe, in the educational content, a use of a medical device or pharmaceutical that is classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as investigational for intended use. Purpose or Case Report: Treatment of prenatally diagnosed lung masses is controversial, with many specialists recommending elective surgical removal in the first year of life because of a reported or perceived increased risk of infection and malignancy, while other centers recommend a conservative approach to management. The natural history of unresected lung masses is not clear. In our center, our standard recommendation is prophylactic resection of asymptomatic lesions, although not all families choose this option. We asked whether respiratory morbidity increased during the time prior to elective resection of prenatally diagnosed lung masses. Methods & Materials: Ninety-eight pregnant women carrying fetuses with chest masses were imaged by ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Medical records of the liveborn infants were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Fetal diagnosis of a lung mass was made at a mean of 27 weeks gestation (range 17-32 wks). Intrauterine fetal demise was documented in 4 pregnancies. There was one elective termination of pregnancy. Three infants were lost to follow up. Thus, outcomes were available for 90 children (59% M, 41% F) with prenatally diagnosed lung masses. Significant respiratory morbidity (RM) was defined as the occurrence of pneumonia, asthma, chronic coughing or wheezing, or respiratory symptoms severe enough to require an Emergency Room visit or hospitalization. Of the 76 children who had surgical removal of their lung mass, 34 (45%) had RM prior to surgery. Fifteen out of 90 children did not have surgery but have been followed expectantly, and 3 of 14 (21%) developed some form of RM. Fifteen of 76 (20%) infants had immediate and significant RM (tachypnea, grunting, increased work of breathing, increased oxygen requirements or need for intubation) in the newborn period leading to urgent surgery (range of age at surgery: 1-10 d; mean 2.5 d). Of the 61 initially asymptomatic infants, 17 (28%) developed RM prior to elective removal of the mass (range 6-96 weeks, mean 17 weeks). Of the lesions removed, histology revealed: cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) 59%, CCAM + sequestration 21%, Sequestration 8%, congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) 7%, CCAM+CLE 1%, other 3%. Conclusions: The risk of respiratory morbidity appears to be increased during the time prior to elective resection of prenatally diagnosed lung masses, which may be important for parents and pediatric specialists to consider when deciding whether to remove an initially asymptomatic lung mass. Purpose or Case Report: It is now accepted that fetal MRI with its superior tissue resolution can be very helpful in clarifying anomalies detected during obstetrical ultrasound. This is particularly the case with intracranial abnormalities, although indications are expanding. The current English medical literature, though, appears to be focused on evolving MRI techniques and how MRI compares to ultrasound with regards to image quality and detection of additional findings which may alter the diagnosis. However, we found no study specifically evaluating the clinical relevance and impact of the information obtained by fetal MRI to the specialists who counsel and treat these patients.",

            "text": "A \"Satisfaction and Clinical Impact\" survey was created and sent to all the members of our Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment Group, asking specifically how the clinicians rated their satisfaction with this type of imaging, its influence on their counseling and on various clinical decisions, both prenatal and postnatal. Results: We received responses from 37 specialists in 10 different clinical disciplines. The greatest number of respondents came from our obstetricians (28%), many of whom perform their own ultrasounds, and from members of our medical geneticists/genetic counselors (27%), although 46% of respondents were from various other clinical disciplines, both medical and surgical. There was a surprisingly high degree of satisfaction overall with the quality of the images and with the type and amount of information provided. Most respondents indicated they felt fetal MRI was \"moderately\" or \"extremely\" useful for their particular clinical decisions, and most respondents agreed that fetal MRI impacted \"moderately\" or \"significantly\" on counseling and management of these pregnancies. Impact appeared greatest on the counseling of the parents and their decision to terminate/pursue the pregnancy, and the least impact was on issues around delivery. Conclusions: Fetal MRI, in addition to providing images of better quality, particularly in certain conditions, has clinical value in that it directly impacts on the counseling of parents and on clinical decisions. 2006-2011. Ultrasound reports were reviewed to determine sonographic diagnoses. Selected patients from this cohort underwent MRI using GE 1.5 Tesla magnet without contrast (Sequences included SSFSE, FIESTA, FGRE or dual echo in 3 planes). The images were reviewed and multiple characteristics were assessed for specifiying the area of obstruction. The features included: presence of normal fluid-filled bowel, small rectum for gestational age, signal of meconium in the rectum, and meconium filled dilated bowel. Results: 46 cases of sonographically suspected bowel obstruction were identified during the study period; 27 of these underwent fetal MRI. Of these 27 cases, 4 had normal MRI and postnatal outcomes, 2 cases did not have postnatal findings available, and 2 had postnatal meconium peritonitis but no obstruction. One case of congenital chloride diarrhea was diagnosed by fetal MRI. A variety of bowel abnormalities were observed amongst the remaining 18 cases. Proximal obstruction was diagnosed in 8 cases: jejunal atresia (n07) and multiple atresia (n01). Distal obstruction was diagnosed in 10 cases: ileal atresia (n03), meconium plugging (n04), closed gastroschisis (n01), enteral duplication cyst (n01), and imperforate anus (n01). Characteristic patterns of features were identified amongst these 18 cases that specified the location of obstruction. These patterns of findings allowed accurate localization of the level of obstruction in all cases when compared to postnatal findings. Distal obstruction was characterized by normal fluid-filled small bowel and high T1 signal in distended loops. Jejunal atresia was characterized by multiple loops of dilated bowel with high T2 signal primarily in the left upper quadrant. Small rectum for gestational age was not consistently associated with proximal or distal atresia. Conclusions: Evaluation of fetal MRI with attention to specific features allows localization of bowel obstruction. This may aid in counseling and postnatal management, including the need and type of postnatal imaging study. Early diagnosis and treatment of PH may prevent clinical deterioration. PVT may produce a spectrum of imaging appearances, which has not been fully recorded in the literature. The goal of this paper is to review the spectrum of imaging appearances of neonates and survivors of neonatal PVT with special emphasis on the role of US and to correlate these findings with the clinical findings including outcome. Methods & Materials: A retrospective review of 133 consecutive neonates admitted between 1999-2003 and diagnosed with PVT was conducted. Diagnosis was established by US at a mean age of 9 days (range: 1-40). Health records, initial and follow-up (f/u) imaging were reviewed. Findings were classified as non occlusive, single branch, PVT (grade 1); occlusive PVT (grade 2) and PVT with extensive parenchymal ischemia (grade 3). Results: PVT was diagnosed in 133 patients, 70 of whom were followed up to for 2 years or longer. Twelve patients were excluded due to liver disease, 22 expired and 29 were lost to f/u. Of the 70 in whom f/u was available, at the time of initial diagnosis, grade 1 PVT was present in 27, all were on the left. Grade 2 PVT was diagnosed in 28 and grade 3 PVT in 15. On f/u physical exam, findings were unremarkable in 68/70 patients. Liver function tests (LFT) and thrombophilia assessment were available in 25 children, mild LFT abnormalities were noted in 9 and 6 children had evidence of thrombophilia. US exams were available in 37/70 children. Among the 37 survivors of neonatal PVT, US was regarded as normal in only 14 children; 16 showed left lobar atrophy (LLA), 5 had slowly progressive splenomegaly without other signs of PH, and 2 developed clinically significant PH requiring shunting. Conclusions: PVT has a wide spectrum of imaging appearances, it is possibly underdiagnosed and clinically unsuspected. Varying degrees of LLA are likely a sequela of clinically silent left PVT. US is a sensitive method for the detection of disease and assessment of progression.",

Barth Purpose or Case Report: To present the fetal MRI findings in fetuses with a prenatal diagnosis of arthrogryposis and correlate with postnatal outcome or autopsy results. Arthrogryposis refers to contractures involving more than one joint which often represent deformational changes secondary to decreased or absent fetal movement. Prognosis varies widely dependent on diagnosis, ranging from isolated contractures in amyoplasia to lethality in some cases. We hypothesized that fetal MRI may demonstrate central nervous system (CNS) pathology and muscle abnormalities which are important for predicting postnatal outcome. Methods & Materials: We identified 6 fetuses with a diagnosis of arthrogryposis between January 2010 and October 2011. All had fetal MRI which was performed on a GE 1.5 Tesla magnet, with SSFSE, FIESTA and FGRE sequences in 3 planes. The fetal MRI's were evaluated for CNS and muscle abnormalities. The extremities were evaluated for: muscle mass, increase in subcutaneous fat (indicative of muscle atrophy), and extremity joint positioning. These findings were subsequently correlated with the clinical exam of the neonates, pathology in the abortus and karyotype when available. Results: Results of fetal US, amniocentesis, fetal MRI and post-natal or post-termination outcomes will be summarized. Five fetuses had \u22652 limb joint contractures. A sixth case had neck hyperextension and lateral flexion associated with akinesia and hydrops. On MRI, no structural brain or spine abnormalities were identified. The abnormalities detected in the extremities were: severe decrease in muscle mass associated with increased subcutaneous fat (3 cases); normal muscle mass (2 cases); moderate decreased muscle mass associated with increased subcutaneous fat (1 case). In the 3 cases that delivered, the diagnoses were amyoplasia (2) and distal arthrogryposis (1). In a fourth case that underwent elective termination, autopsy was consistent with amyoplasia. Two cases are pending delivery.",

            "text": "Conclusions: While fetal MRI can be useful to rule out CNS anomalies, it may also provide important information on decreased muscle mass as an important prognostic sign in a fetus with arthrogryposis. In our series, severely decreased muscle mass was predictive of amyoplasia, and joint contractures limited to hands and feet with preserved proximal muscle mass was predictive of distal arthrogryposis. Both diagnoses are associated with relatively good prognosis and usually normal intelligence. Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of iterative reconstruction technique (IRT) on image quality metrics measured in child-sized anthropomorphic phantoms as kVp is changed. Methods & Materials: CT scans were performed on anthropomorphic phantoms with sizes of 1, 5 & 10 years (ATOM Phantoms, CIRS, Norfolk Virginia) using low dose pediatric chest protocols (1.6, 3 & 6 mSv) to determine baseline noise and dose levels. Subsequently three voltage levels (120, 100 & 80 kVp) were used while adjusting mAs to maintain baseline CTDIvol and without mAs adjustment which allowed varied CTDIvol. Images were reconstructed using 100% filtered back projection (FBP) and blends FBP: IR (80:20, 60:40, & 40:60) . Parameters including CTDIvol, dose length product, scan length, kVp, and mAs, were recorded for each scan. Image noise, contrast:noise (CNR), and signal:noise (SNR) data were recorded from ROIs in phantoms and dilute iodine contrast filled syringes (5, 3, 1.5%). Results: As kV is lowered from 120 to 80, image noise is doubled if mAs is not increased to maintain CTDIvol, and CNR is increased but SNR is decreased due to the increased image noise. As kVp is lowered from 120 to 80, image noise is increased nominally (8-21%) if mAs is increased to maintain CTDIvol; therefore the increase in CNR and decrease in SNR is negligible. CTDIvol is reduced >300% in all phantom scans as kV is reduced from 120 to 80. IRT reduces image noise by up to 36% [range 10-41%] in all phantom sizes and in clinical images. As CTDIvol is maintained in patient scans, image noise, CNR, and SNR are reduced in patients (p<0.05), resulting in improved image quality. Conclusions: When lowering kVp, compensation with increases in mAs is necessary to maintain CTDIvol. However, lower target CTDIvol can be achieved when adding IRT as image noise can be decreased. For these phantoms, CNR and SNR improved using all [selected] levels of IR, even when kV was reduced, resulting in lower CTDIvol in phantoms. At all kVp settings when IRT is applied, image noise is reduced, resulting in improved CNR and SNR for all phantoms.

            "text": "The raw data from 14 consecutive low-dose pediatric abdomen exams was gathered. A dose simulation tool which adds noise to raw projection data was employed to simulate tube current at 1/4 of baseline mA. Data were reconstructed with both standard filtered back projection and with AIDR. Regions of interest were drawn in the liver and lumbar musculature to determine the signalto-noise (SNR), contrast-to-noise (CNR) and overall diagnostic quality of each data set. Statistical significance was determined using a Student's t-test. Subjective image quality was evaluated by two reader blind review using a five point scale (50excellent, 10unacceptable). Results: The SNR and CNR were significantly lower for the 75% dose reduction datasets compared to the original filtered back projection reconstructions (SNR: 3.59 vs 2.20, p<0.001; CNR: 1.24 vs 0.75, p00.01). When AIDR was applied to the 75% dose reduction data, the SNR and CNR improved to be superior to the native case (SNR: 3.59 vs 5.48, p<0.001; CNR: 1.24 vs 1.95, p00.02). The average image quality score for the low dose datasets with AIDR was 4.2 compared to 3.4 with standard filtered back projection at the baseline mA Conclusions: AIDR significantly improves the image quality of pediatric abdominal CT images. With a simulated 75% reduction in dose, AIDR produces images with significantly greater SNR and CNR. The subjective image quality scores for AIDR showed dramatic improvement over standard filtered back projection. AIDR processing algorithms with ultra-helical 320 MDCT will allow 75% reduction in radiation exposure while achieving the same diagnostic quality as compared to routine pediatric abdomen MDCT radiation protocols with filtered back projection processing algorithms. Purpose or Case Report: To explore incorporating ASIR into pediatric head CT protocols, to reduce patient radiation dose while maintaining image quality. Methods & Materials: An Alderson RANDO head phantom was estimated to approximate the size of a 7-year-old child's head, and was scanned at decreasing 10% mA intervals (100 to 50%, 150 to 75 mA) relative to this institution's age-based head CT protocols. Each of these studies was then was reconstructed at 10% ASIR intervals (0% to 100%), and a 100 mm2 ROI was obtained in a consistent location behind the frontal bone to estimate noise (SD). Using this phantom data, our ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt follow-up CT protocol was modified, and patients were scanned at 20% ASIR with approximately 20% mA reductions relative to our normal age-based mAs. These ASIR studies were then anonymously compared to older non-ASIR head CT studies from the same patients (with identical kVp/slice thickness) by two blinded attending pediatric neuroradiologists. All studies were evaluated subjectively for diagnostic utility (1-4), sharpness (1-5), noise (1-4), and artifacts (1-4). 50-100 mm2 ROIs were drawn in consistent locations to estimate noise in air, bone, CSF, and white matter (WM). Results: The phantom study suggested similar same noise levels at 100% mA/0% ASIR (3.9) and 80% mA/20% ASIR (3.7). 12 patients (average09, range01 to 17 years) were then scanned at approximately 20% mA reductions, with an average of 349 days (range027 to 871 days) between the ASIR study and prior non-ASIR study. The average CTDIvol and DLP values of the 20% ASIR studies were 22.4 mGy and 338.4 mGy-cm, and for the non-ASIR studies were 28.8 mGy and 444.5 mGy-cm, representing statistically significant decreases in the CTDIvol (22.1%, p00.00007) and DLP (23.9%, p00.0005) values. There were no significant differences between the ASIR studies and non-ASIR studies in respect to diagnostic acceptability (p00.33), sharpness (p0 0.45), or noise (p00.84). There was a non-significant trend that the ASIR studies had a lower artifact score (1.8 vs 2.1, p0 0.06). There was good to perfect (kappa00.5 to 1.0) agreement. The ASIR studies had statistically significant decreased CSF noise (3.0 vs 4.4, p00.0000008), but no noise differences were seen in air (p00.46), bone (p00.26), or WM (p00.22). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ASIR can provide dose reductions in pediatric head CT without affecting image quality. Purpose or Case Report: To validate the T2 map as a noninvasive quantitative biomarker of fatty infiltration of muscles and to determine whether the T2 map can differentiate between boys with DMD and healthy boys. Methods & Materials: Two groups of boys with similar ages (range 5-15 years) were evaluated: 42 boys with DMD (mean age 10.4 years) and 29 healthy boys (mean age 11.7 years). MR images were performed at 3 T. Fatty infiltration of the pelvic and thigh muscles on T1-weighted images (WI) was graded from 0 to 4. On T2 maps with and without fat suppression, the muscle with the greatest fatty infiltration on T1-WI was selected, and a region of interest was placed to obtain T2 values. T2 values from T2 maps with fat suppression were subtracted from values of T2 maps without fat suppression and designated as the \"T2 fat value.\" T2 fat values were obtained from the same muscles in all boys. Comparison was made between the T2 fat values of the two groups. The upper reference limit of the reference interval (RI) of T2 fat values was obtained from the control group to establish the normal range and applied to both groups to determine the accuracy of the T2 map. Results: The gluteus maximus muscle had the greatest fatty infiltration on T1-WI. Median T2 fat value was 73.0 msec for DMD (95% RI 193.8, range 29.2-175.6) and 7.5 msec for the control group (95% RI 19.2, range 1.4-21.6). When applied to the two groups, the upper reference limit of the RI for control patients yielded 100% sensitivity, 93% specificity, 95% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Utilization of T2 maps for the quantitative measurement of fatty infiltration of muscles can clearly differentiate between DMD and normal control boys with a high degree of accuracy and precision. This advanced noninvasive technique may potentially replace invasive muscle biopsies currently used for diagnosis. Purpose or Case Report: Prior work has shown that the gluteus maximus muscle has the greatest T2 relaxation time on MR imaging using T2 mapping in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, an increased T2 value on T2 relaxation time mapping may reflect both fatty infiltration and inflammation of the muscle. Fatty infiltration characteristically follows inflammation in this disease process. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of each component (fat and inflammation) within gluteus maximus muscles and to correlate each component to clinical assessments. Methods & Materials: Forty-six boys with DMD (ages: 5-15 years) were recruited. MR imaging of the pelvis using T2 maps with and without fat suppression were performed. The T2 map \"fat values\" (T2 value calculated from the T2 map without fat suppression [FS] minus T2 map with FS) and the T2 map \"inflammation value\" (T2 value from the T2 map with FS) were obtained. Clinical assessments typically used to evaluate DMD patients (including clinical functional score, 30 ft run, Gower score, and 4 step-up time) were also performed. Spearman correlation coefficients between fat and inflammation values and the clinical assessments were calculated. Results: There was a statistically significant correlation between the fat value of the gluteus maximus muscle and each clinical assessment test (p<0.05). However, the inflammation value of the gluteus maximus muscle did not correlate with any clinical assessment. Conclusions: In DMD, the amount of fatty infiltration of the gluteus maximus muscle has excellent correlation with clinical assessment. The amount of inflammation of the gluteus maximus muscle, however, does not correlate with clinical function. Therefore, further study is needed to determine whether components (fatty infiltration or muscle inflammation) of the single most involved muscle reflect the components of all the muscles of the pelvis and thighs and whether the cumulative muscle involvement of each component represents clinical disease severity.",

Lamya Atweh, MD, Radiology, Texas Children's Hospital, laatweh@texaschildrens.org; Robert C. Orth, Wei Zhang, R. Paul Guillerman, Herman Kan Purpose or Case Report: At our institution, gadolinium contrast-enhanced MR sequences are often obtained to assess epiphyseal and non-epiphyseal osteonecrosis in children. Several studies have shown that dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences may provide prognostic information about long-term complications and healing of osteonecrosis. To our knowledge, no studies have determined the added value of routine post-contrast MR imaging in assessing acute complications related to chronic osteonecrosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of intravenous gadolinium contrast in the MRI identification of complications in children with an established diagnosis of osteonecrosis. Methods & Materials: 64 patients were restrospectively identified (age range: 1.75 years to 25.75 year; M:F 0 59:80) with an imaging diagnosis of chronic osteonecrosis who underwent 139 contrast-enhanced MR studies between 1/2000 and 9/2011. The pre-and post-contrast MR images were consensus reviewed by two CAQ pediatric radiologists. Pre-and post-contrast images were reviewed at separate times. The pre-contrast images were available during the review of post contrast images. Studies were assessed for: osteonecrosis location (epiphyseal, non-epiphyseal osteonecrosis, or both), joint effusion, marrow edema, and epiphyseal collapse. 95% confidence interval (CI) and Cohen's kappa coefficient(\u03ba) was calculated to assess observed agreement. Results: The diagnosis of osteonecrosis without complicating features was made in 49.6% (CI: 41.3-58.0%) (69/139) of pre-contrast studies and 53.2% (CI: 45.0%-61.5%) (74/ 139) of post-contrast studies. When chronic osteonecrosis with complicating features was identified,pre-and postcontrast images idenfied joint effusion in 44.9% (57/127) and 51.2% (65/127) (\u03ba00.686, p<0.001); marrow edema in 50.4% (70/139) and 46.8% (65/139) (\u03ba00.727, p<0.001); and epiphyseal collapse in 51.2% (65/127) and 42.5% (54/ 127) (\u03ba00.796, p<0.001), respectively. Myositis or muscle strain was incidentally diagnosed in 12.2% (17/139) pre-contrast and 10.1% (14/139) post-contrast (\u03ba 0 0.674, P <0.001) studies. Conclusions: The high observed agreement between the pre-and post-contrast MR images shows that the addition of intravenous gadolinium may not be necessary in the majority of children with chronic osteonecrosis.",

Doria Purpose or Case Report: Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI has the potential to identify regions of early hypoxic and vascular joint changes in inflammatory arthritis. At this point, there is no standard protocol for data analysis of BOLD MRI measurements in musculoskeletal disorders. Standardization of the technique is paramount to compare results between studies and assess the validity of this technique in tissues outside the blood-brain barrier. Our objective is to optimize BOLD MRI reading parameters in a rabbit model of inflammatory arthritis by determining the diagnostic accuracy of (1) statistical threshold values (r>0.01 vs r>0.2), (2) summary measures of BOLD MRI contrast [ the mean of the % BOLD signal differences within the region of interest (ROI) (diff_on_off) and the percentage of suprathreshold voxels within the ROI (PT%)], and (3) voxel activation algorithm (positive, negative, and positive_negative). Methods & Materials: Using BOLD MRI protocols with a carbogen stimulus on a 1.5 T magnet, we imaged injected and contralateral knee joints of 21 juvenile rabbits at baseline, and days 1, 14 and 28 after a unilateral intra-articular injection of carrageenin. Nine non-injected rabbits served as controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the reading parameters. The BOLD measures from [(injected knee-control knees)/control knees] were counted as positive cases, while the BOLD measures from [(contralateral knees-control knees)/control knees] were regarded as negative cases. Areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated to determine the most accurate parameters. Results: Using diff_on_off and positive_negative activations as constants, r>0.01 was found to be more accurate than r>0.2 (p00.03 at day 28). Comparison of diff_on_off and PT% yielded no statistically significant difference (p> 0.05). Finally, positive_negative activations for diff_on_off and negative activations for PT% using r>0.01 were the most diagnostically accurate (AUC00.78, p<0.01 at day 28, and AUC00.90, p<0.01). Conclusions: From the results of this study, the most diagnostically accurate and clinically relevant reading parameters included the use of a more lenient threshold of r>0.01, a diff_on_off measure of BOLD contrast, and a positive_negative voxel activation algorithm. PT% may used as an ancillary measure of BOLD contrast.",

Methods & Materials: 12 boys, 11 with hemophilia (A, n09; B, n02) and 1 with von Willebrand disease, median age 13 (range, 6-17) underwent a high resolution MRI protocol at 1.5 Tesla, x-rays, and physical examination using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) system. Two blinded radiologists scored the MRI examinations for cartilage items (horizontal component: surface erosions, scores 0-2 and vertical component: cartilage degradation, scores 0-4) according to the semiquantitative method (International Prophylaxis Study Group MRI scale). An experienced operator applied a validated quantitative 3D-MRI method (horizontal components: AC, VC, VCtAB, ThCtAB; vertical component: ThCcAB) to corresponding high resolution MR images of ankles. Results: Internal correlation of the semi-quantitative method components was substantial (r00.72, P<0.0001, tibia) to high (r00.91, P<0.0001, talus) in any site of investigation, but it was site-specific with the quantitative method, being significant only in the talar trochlea (r00.86, P<0.0001). External correlation of corresponding components of the semiquantitative and quantitative methods was moderate (r00.55, P00.005) to poor (r00.39, P00.05) for horizontal components, and non-existent for vertical components. Components of the semi-quantitative method highly correlated with lifetime number of previous ankle bleeds (r00.74-0.84, P<0.0001), Pettersson x-ray (r00.87-0.94, P<0.0001), and HJHS scores (r00.91, P<0.0001). This correlation was poor (r00.42, P0 0.04) to moderate (r0\u22120.56, P00.004) for horizontal components of the quantitative method. Conclusions: The biologic concepts of the semi-quantitative and quantitative MRI methods are distinct for assessment of ankles. The semi-quantitative method is valid for assessing cartilage changes in cross-sectional studies of blood-induced arthropathy, however the quantitative method is suboptimal or less powerful for this purpose.",

This frequently results in uncomfortable patient positioning, motion, poor fat suppression, low SNR and there is currently lack of a dedicated pediatric elbow coil in the commercial market. Our goal was to explore the usefulness of a new coil array dedicated for pediatric elbow imaging and to compare quantitative & qualitative imaging findings to commercially available coils. Methods & Materials: An eight channel elbow coil was designed. The coil frame was designed to be rigid and lightweight. Seven identical loop coils were built into a polycarbonate frame and an eighth coil built into a paddle that fits into the top frame. The coil elements were constructed with heavy copper to provide a high Q-factor and increased SNR. The complete coil including electronics & covering, weighs only 1.4 kg. MR Imaging under IRB approval was performed on a GE 1.5 T scanner using a routine clinical elbow protocol including T1W, PDW, T2W, Fat-Sat, Non-fat-sat, 2D & 3D sequences. Subjects were positioned feet-first with the elbow on the side & were subjectively assessed for comfort level. Images obtained from the new coil & from the current commercial coils were compared for SNR. Results: Scan positioning was reported to be comfortable. SNR was between 20-25% higher as compared to the routine coils. Fat saturation was uniform, indicating that the magnetic susceptibility of the coil is well-matched to human anatomy. Anatomical detail depiction was subjectively better for anatomic features such as trochlea. Detection & diagnostic confidence of elbow disorders were improved with the new coil & greatly decreased motion artifacts were observed. Conclusions: The new pediatric elbow coil provided excellent image quality, patient acceptance and clinical performance improvements over existing coils. The open coil design also allows for imaging of the elbow in a partially flexed position or in a cast. The advantages provided by the new coil are expected to include shortened image acquisition times (via parallel imaging) & increased SNR. Disclosure: Dr. Serai has indicated that he will discuss or describe, in the educational content, a use of a medical device or pharmaceutical that is classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as investigational for intended use.",

Patients were separated into 3 groups based on MRI findings: normal, ligamentous injury, or osteochondral injury (osteochondral lesions, bone contusions/fracture, and avulsion injury). Knee radiographs were consensus reviewed by two CAQ pediatric radiologists blinded to MRI findings and categorized into the same groups. Radiograph and MRI findings were compared and categorized into 3 groups: neutral if radiograph and MRI findings were the same, misleading if findings were discordant, or helpful if radiographs improved MR interpretation. The latter group was analyzed for impact on MR diagnosis. Results: For 194 knee radiographs, 166 were normal, 2 showed ligamentous injuries, and 26 showed osteochondral injuries. When radiographs were interpreted as normal (N0 166), by MR 44% were normal, 33% had ligamentous injury, 10% had osteochondral injury, and 13% had both ligamentous and osteochondral injury. When radiographs were interpreted as ligamentous injury (N02), by MR 50% were normal and 50% had ligamentous injury. When radiographs were interpreted as osteochondral injuries, by MR 8% had ligamentous injury, 38% had osteochondral injury, and 54% had both ligamentous and osteochondral injury.

Nadel Purpose or Case Report: Vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis are a potential complication of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To date, the incidence of vertebral fractures during ALL treatment has not been reported Methods & Materials: We prospectively evaluated 155 children with ALL during the first 12 months of leukemia therapy. Lateral thoracolumbar spine radiographs were obtained at diagnosis and 12 months. Vertebral bodies were assessed for incident vertebral fractures using the Genant semi-quantitative method, and relevant clinical indices such as spine bone mineral density (BMD), back pain and the presence of vertebral fractures at diagnosis were analyzed for association with incident vertebral fractures. Results: Of the 155 children, 25 (16%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 11% to 23%) had a total of 61 incident vertebral fractures, of which 32 (52%) were moderate or severe. Thirteen of the 25 children with incident vertebral fractures (52%) also had fractures at the time of diagnosis. Vertebral fractures at diagnosis increased the odds of an incident fracture at 12 months by an odds ratio of 7.3 (95% CI 2.3 to 23.1, p00.001). In addition, for every 1.0 standard deviation reduction in spine BMD Z-score at diagnosis, there was 1.8-fold increased odds for incident vertebral fracture at 12 months (95% CI 1.2 to 2.7%, p00.006). Conclusions: Children with ALL have a high incidence of vertebral fractures 12 months after diagnosis, and the presence of vertebral fractures and reductions in spine BMD Zscores at diagnosis are highly associated clinical features. Purpose or Case Report: To provide objective measures of acetabular morphology utilizing volume-rendered CT and to better characterize normal acetabular development in adolescents. Implications for the diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) will be discussed. Methods & Materials: 146 hips in 73 consecutive patients (36 female, 37 male; ages 13-20 years) who underwent abdominal and pelvic CT for non-hip related complaints were retrospectively examined. Examinations were performed for a variety of complaints, including abdominal pain, nephrolithiasis, vomiting etc. Patients with obvious hip pathology were excluded. Pelvic rotation was eliminated, and pelvic inclination was measured and corrected to 60\u00b0u tilizing a volume rendered CT model. Measurements of femoral head diameter (FHD), anterior femoral head coverage (FHCA), and posterior femoral head coverage (FHCP) were obtained. Femoral head area (FHA) was defined as \u03c0(FHD/2)2. Percent anterior femoral head coverage (%FHCA) was defined as (FHCA/FHA)*100. Percent posterior femoral head coverage (%FHCP) was defined as (FHCP/FHA)*100. Acetabular version by volume-rendered CT (AVVR) was defined as (FHCP/FHCA). Results: Average pelvic inclination angle (sd) was 70.9 (5.6) for females and 64.8 (6.3) for males. Average (sd) %FHCA was 22.7 (4.9) for males and 18.6 (5.6) for females. Average (sd) AVVR was 2.39 (0.57) for males and 3.42 (1.19) for females. Among males, average AVVR decreased with subject age. On the other hand, there was little change in average AVVR with age among females. Conclusions: Average AVVR is greater for females than males, and this difference becomes more striking with increasing subject age. This represents an unexpected finding given the reported increased incidence of \"pincer\" type FAI among females. Characterization of acetabular morphology among adolescents with clinical FAI should consider subject age and gender. In this regard, volumerendered CT is capable of providing an objective measure of acetabular morphology.",

All radiographs were previously interpreted by a CAQ-certified pediatric radiologist varying in experience from 1 year to 57 years. 745 abnormals were identified, including 305 elbows, 168 wrists, 175 knees and 97 ankles. All radiographs were determined to be \"as dictated\", missed significant finding, or overcall. Attention was focused on the missed findings and overcalls. Results: Findings were as follows: elbow radiographs-14 missed findings and 10 overcalls, wrist radiographs-12 missed findings and 5 overcalls, knee radiographs-9 missed findings and 0 overcalls, ankle radiographs-14 missed findings and 10 overcalls. This resulted in a total of 49 missed findings (6.6% of abnormals) and 25 overcalls (3.4% of abnormals). Of the 49 misses, 49% were fractures. The highest mistake percentage occured in the ankles where the combined misses and overcalls approached 25%. This was also the location where we found the highest percentage of missed fractures (9.0%) Conclusions: When just abnormal cases were considered, fully trained pediatric radiologists have a mistake rate of approximately 9.8%, if misses and overcalls are included.

Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) is free of ionizing-radiation, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use that making this technique suitable for follow-up of hemophilic children with clinical suspicion of osteoporosis. To our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the value of QUS for longitudinal assessment of growing bones in an animal model which is paramount for clinical translation of the technique once change in measurements could relate to either the baseline pathology or physiologic bone growth variability.

Midshaft tibia speed-of-sound (SOS) was measured at baseline, and weeks 8 and 17 of the experiment. Two operators scanned each site twice at each time point. QUS measurements were compared to microCT (reference standard) on week 17 to validate the study results. Results: The SOS measured in the control group increased significantly (P<0.001) over the 17 week period. There was not such an increase in the arthritis SOS value (P>0.05). In both groups the overall intra-operator coefficient of variation of SOS measurements was 6% at baseline and decreased to 2% at week 17 likely due to increased tibia size. The inter-operator reliability was 6% at baseline and 3% at week 17. With regard to the effect of bone growth on QUS measurements for the control group (n 016), SOS values increased by 419.13 m/s, whereas for the pathologic group (n08), they only increased by 195 m/s. Statistically significant differences in ratios of SOS between final/baseline results were noted (P 00.016) between the pathologic and control groups. Conclusions: The longitudinal use of QUS has an acceptable intra-and inter-operator reliability. Even accounting for the significant impact that bone growth has on QUS measurements over time, QUS can differentiate pathologic from control knees in the proposed animal model and holds potential for clinical use in the assessment of osteoporosis in hemophilic children. Methods & Materials: The study was approved by the institutional review board. 68 pediatric patients with 73 abdominal tumors (34 malignant and 39 benign lesions) underwent diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) on clinical 1.5 T (n039) and 3 T (n029) MRI scanners. ADC maps were generated from b0500 DWI and ADC values were retrospectively and independently measured by two radiologists. ADC values of benign and malignant tumors were compared with the Welch two sample t-test. A p value of 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significant differences. In addition, a receiver operating curve analysis (ROC) was performed to determine the optimal cut-off ADC value for differentiating benign and malignant tumors. Results: The mean ADC value (mm2/sec) of benign tumors was 1.681 x 10-3 for the first reader and 1.679 x 10-3 for the second reader. The mean ADC value (mm2/sec) of malignant abdominal tumors was 1.018 x 10-3 for the first reader and 1.113 x 10-3 for the second reader. The differences between benign and malignant tumors were statistically significant (p<0.001 for both readers). ROC analysis revealed an optimal cut-off ADC value for differentiating malignant and solid tumors as 1.1 x 10-3 mm2/sec. Conclusions: Diffusion-weighted imaging with ADC maps can be used to differentiate between benign and malignant pediatric abdominal tumors.",

Improved therapy has led to an increase in the number of long-term survivors. Many of these survivors are now experiencing late effects as a result of the original disease process or its treatment. These late effects are frequently identified on imaging. The purpose of this study is to create a database of the imaging findings of long-term survivors of pediatric malignancy in an attempt to begin to classify the findings and identify associations. Methods & Materials: After IRB approval, the institutional cancer registry was searched to identify all patients younger than 20 years of age who were diagnosed with a solid tumor between 1980 and 2005. Patients were included in the database if they survived for more than 2 years from the date of their initial diagnosis. The electronic medical record system was then used to obtain demographic and treatment information for each included patient. The dictated reports from all cross-sectional imaging studies evaluating the chest, abdomen, or pelvis performed more than two years from the date of diagnosis were then reviewed. Each positive imaging finding was classified by the involved organ. Results: After querying the institutional cancer registry, 909 patients were identified who met the inclusion criteria for this database. The most common neoplasms were neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, and astrocytoma. Of the included subjects, 420 had imaging of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Overall, 2851 reports were evaluated and classified. Findings were most commonly identified in the lungs, musculoskeletal system, kidneys, liver, and lymph nodes. Conclusions: A database examining the late effects in longterm survivors of pediatric malignancies was created. This database has the potential to help identify the radiologic manifestations of the complications of cancer therapy and thus help guide rationally determined long-term risk-benefit ratios in the treatment of pediatric malignancies.",

            "text": "Imaging Followup of Lymphoma in Pediatric Patients: Is Pelvic CT Necessary? Javier Lopez Bueno, MD, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, jlopezbueno@cheo.on.ca; Nishard Abdeen Purpose or Case Report: Pelvic CT is often included in the imaging followup of patient with lymphoma before, during and after treatment to assess response to treatment and monitoring for relapses. While such followup is expected to improve detection of relapse, there is little objective evidence of its effectiveness in lymphoma. Anecdotally, there are few pelvic relapses in pediatric patients with lymphoma regardless of primary site. We hypothesize that pelvic CT could be avoided as part of the followup without adverse impact on survival or in the detection rate of relapses, and with subsequent significant reduction in the radiation dose, particularly to the gonads. Methods & Materials: Research ethics board approval was obtained. Patients diagnosed with lymphoma and with at least one year of followup at our tertiary care pediatric hospital were included. Sex, age, type of lymphoma, stage, primary site, site of relapse if any as well as the number of CT scans of the head, neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis were recorded. Results: A total of 29 patients met study criteria. There were 21 males and 8 females, with an average age of 11.9 years (range 3-17 years). Eighteen patients had Hodgkin disease (62%) and eleven had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (38%). Mean length of followup was 3.8 years (range 1-12 years). An average of 4.5 pelvic scans per patient were performed for surveillance (range 0-12). Three relapses were detected. Of these only one was in the pelvis, in a patient whose initial T cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma was extensive and involved the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis. Conclusions: This study suggests a low incidence of pelvic relapse in pediatric patients with lymphoma. The routine use of pelvic CT in surveillance protocols may therefore be of little benefit while imposing a significant radiation burden. Our study is limited by small sample size and short length of followup. Further large scale studies are required. (ESFT) is performed by measuring the size of the tumors before and after chemotherapy. The proposed method of measuring tumor size, however, differs amongst RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), WHO (World Health Organization) and COG (Children's Oncology Group) response criteria. In our project, we assessed whether response classification differs between the three different methods. Methods & Materials: After IRB approval, we retrospectively analyzed MRI studies of 55 patients with Ewing Sarcoma who were treated at Stanford and UCSF Medical Centers. Tumor size was assessed before and after therapy. Tumor measurements were obtained using RECIST 1.1 (longest single diameter), WHO (longest diameter and perpendicular diameter), and COG criteria (three measurements to calculate tumor volume). Tumor response was assessed by the differences in sizes of the tumors before and after treatment using four response categories: progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), and complete response (CR). Concordance between the three response classification systems was assessed using Cohen's kappa (k) coefficient and percentage of disagreement per response category. Results: The k statistic for concordance in COG/WHO, COG/ RECIST and RECIST/WHO were 0.663, 0.210 and 0.166 respectively. Disagreement rates for RECIST/WHO, COG/ WHO, and COG/RECIST were 12.73, 34.55, and 47.27% respectively. Using tumor volume, twenty-six patients were reclassified: twenty-four cases of Stable Disease coded by RECIST were reclassified as Progressive Disease by COG and two cases of Partial Response coded by RECIST were reclassified as Complete Response by COG.",

Russell, Eugene S. Kim Purpose or Case Report: Surgical resection is a standard part of multimodality treatment of neuroblastoma, the most common abdominal malignancy of infancy and early childhood. Chylous ascites is a rarely reported complication of surgery for abdominal neuroblastoma, and is likely underrecognized, posing the risk of nutritional deterioration and sepsis. To facilitate early diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapy, we present the salient imaging findings of the largest known series of chylous ascites following surgery for abdominal neuroblastoma. Methods & Materials: All patients with abdominal neuroblastoma complicated by post-operative chylous ascites over a five-year period at a large children's hospital were identified by a database search. A retrospective review of the imaging studies and clinical charts was conducted. Results: Chylous ascites developed following surgical resection of abdominal neuroblastoma in 5 of 36 patients, with the diagnosis made between postoperative days 20 and 33. Four cases were high-risk neuroblastoma and one was intermediaterisk neuroblastoma. All 5 cases involved resection of an adrenal mass and dissection around the abdominal great vessels. All 5 cases manifested with abdominal distention on physical exam, and ascites was suspected clinically in 3 cases. Computed tomography (CT) in all 5 cases revealed a large volume of ascites of near-water attenuation (range of \u22123 to 16.5 Hounsfield units). The 3 cases imaged with ultrasound (US) showed hypoechoic or anechoic ascites without septations. The chylous ascites resolved after 1-4 months of treatment with dietary fat restriction, medium chain triglycerides, intravenous octreotide, or peritoneal catheter drainage. Conclusions: Chylous ascites is an under-recognized complication of surgical resection for abdominal neuroblastoma, occurring in 14% of patients in this series. The diagnosis is supported by the demonstration on CT or US of a large volume of ascites causing abdominal distention 3-5 weeks post-operatively. The ascites is typically near-water in attenuation rather than fatty in attenuation and should not be misattributed to peritonitis, hemorrhage, bowel leak, or early tumor recurrence.",

Khademian, Tanya Hinds, Katherine Deye, Allison M. Jackson, Eglal Shalaby-Rana Purpose or Case Report: To evaluate the incidence and nature of cervical spine injuries and relationship to posterior fossa abnormalities in children who underwent brain and cervical spine MRI as part of the clinical workup for suspected physical abuse. Methods & Materials: Authors retrospectively analyzed records of eighty-five children less than three years of age who were documented by the Child Protective Services at a level one pediatric trauma center over a period of four years (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) . Only patients who underwent both MRI imaging of the cervical spines (c-spine) in addition to brain imaging as part of the clinical workup were included. Cspine and posterior fossa of brain MRIs were independently reviewed by two pediatric neuroradiologists, both blinded to clinical details. C-spine abnormalities (bone marrow edema, cord edema, intrathecal blood, disc pathology, soft tissue/ ligamentous injury, vascular injury) were documented and correlated with abnormalities seen in the posterior fossa (blood, brainstem edema, cerebellar edema). Results: At this time, 40/82 patients have been reviewed. Twenty patients (50%) had both cervical spine injuries and posterior fossa abnormalities. There were no patients with isolated cervical spine injuries without posterior fossa abnormalities, but there were five patients (12.5%) that had posterior fossa abnormalities in the absence of c-spine injuries. Fifteen patients (37.5%) did not have any spinal or posterior fossa imaging abnormality. None of the patients had bone marrow edema, disc pathology, or intrathecal blood. One patient had vascular neck injury and cord edema. Conclusions: Our results show that the incidence of cervical spine injury in children under investigation for abusive head trauma is as high as 50%. Our data show further that cervical spine injury predicted posterior fossa injury in all patients, while presence of posterior fossa injury predicted concomitant c-spine injury in only 75%. The incidence of c-spine trauma we found in these patients is higher than reported elsewhere in the literature and may impact whether or not routine c-spine MRI will be included in national imaging guidelines for children under investigation of abusive head trauma.",

Part of the difficulty in assessing height is due to uncertainties in actual distance. Objective: To determine what types of skull fractures can occur in pediatric and adult post-mortem human specimens during controlled impacts on hard surfaces from various heights. Methods & Materials: Skull fracture patterns in postmortem human specimens from a unique bank of pediatric specimens (30-week gestation to 16-years-old, n013) were subjected to controlled drops from both arbitrarily low heights (15 and 30 cm) and high heights (2 m) onto an aluminum platen. The specimens were dissected from the neck at the occipital condyles and intracranial were sealed inside the head using PMMA. The heads were dropped on to five different impact locations. Fractures were identified using palpation and high resolution MDCT. Results: No specimens between 33-weeks-gestation and 24days-old sustained fractures from the 15-30 cm drops. Three out of four (75%) specimens ages between 5-and 22-months old fractured due to the 15 or 30 cm drops. The 9-and 16-year-old specimens and all adult specimens survived the 15-30 cm drops. All specimens subjected to the 2 m drop fractured. The specimen between 11-months and 22-months sustained either a linear fractures or diastatic fractures from the 15 cm and 30 cm drops.",

Zakhari, Lily H P. Nguyen Purpose or Case Report: To compare a new classification of temporal bone fractures which specifically evaluates involvement of the otic capsule against the traditional classification system (transverse versus oblique versus longitudinal), to evaluate whether this new classification is able to better identify patients at risk of adverse otologic outcome and neurologic complications in the pediatric population. Methods & Materials: A retrospective hospital chart review was performed by ENT colleagues searching for all patients with temporal bone fractures seen at our center over the past 10 years. This was followed by a blinded review of the CT heads by a resident and a trained pediatric radiologist with neuro expertise. These CTs were evaluated for petrous involvement, otic capsule involvement and any associated intracranial lesions. This information was then correlated with clinical outcome measures including post-traumatic hearing deficit, facial nerve palsy, persisting CSF leak and global neurologic sequelae. The new classification was compared to the traditional one, and specifically analysed for the ability to better predict the clinical outcomes. Results: Expectedly, pediatric temporal bone fractures were infrequent and otic involvement even more rare. Fractures with involvement of the otic capsule (versus otic sparing) were found more frequently in boys. They were also more likely to be associated with immediate otologic signs and neurologic findings on presentation. These fractures also had the highest association with conductive hearing deficit (>60%) and were twice as likely as otic sparing fractures to be associated with immediate facial nerve palsy and with more important concomitant intracranial injuries such as midline shift. Conclusions: While our numbers are small, our results suggest a trend that when temporal bone fractures show involvement of the otic capsule, there is higher risk of adverse otologic outcome and neurologic complications even in the pediatric population.",

Leach, Mekibib Altaye Purpose or Case Report: The pathophysiology of sportsrelated concussion (SRC) is poorly understood, especially for children. Following SRC and mild traumatic brain injury in adults, a few MRI and proton MRS studies have identified axonal injury with declines in the neurometabolite N-acetyl aspartate (NAA). We wanted to examine a SRC adolescent population with proton MRS, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and other MRI methods within 72 h of concussion and with short term followup to determine if there were differences in imaging metrics with age and sex matched healthy control participants. Methods & Materials: Twelve children, ages 11-15 years, who experienced SRC were evaluated with ImPACT neurocognitive testing, T1-weighted MRI, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), DTI, proton MRS, and phase contrast angiography (PCA) at less than 72 h, 14 days and 30 days or greater post-concussion. Healthy, age and sex matched controls for each SRC participant were recruited and evaluated at a single time point. Quantitative imaging metrics included fractional anisotropy, metabolite concentrations, and global cerebral blood flow (CBF). Group comparisons were examined by paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test. Correlational data employed Spearman rank correlation. Results: ImPACT results revealed significant differences in initial total symptom score (TSS), and reaction time (RT) for the SRC group compared with the control group, with TSS resolving by a mean of 14 days and RT at 30 days. No evidence of structural injury was observed qualitatively for either group. Analyses between groups or over time within the SRC group found no decreases in NAA or elevation of lactic acid upon MRS, and no changes in fractional anisotropy upon DTI. Within the SRC group, significant changes in the global CBF were observed. Improvement towards control values occurred by 14 days for 27% and by 30 days for 64% of SRC group participants. Conclusions: Pediatric SRC affects global CBF without evidence of structural or metabolic injury.",

Lindquist, Matthew R. Skelton, Gail J. Pyne-Geithman, Joseph F. Clark Purpose or Case Report: Creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) is an untreatable X-linked mental retardation syndrome with severe cognitive and speech impairment. Patients are identified by an absence of creatine in the brain on MR spectroscopy (MRS) and distinguished from two creatine synthesis deficiency syndromes with genetic testing. For CTD, the absence of the transporter (SLC6A8) prevents creatine from crossing the blood brain barrier and entering brain cells. A brain specific CTD knockout mouse was developed replicating key features of the human disease and establishing an animal model for treatment of CTD. We report the successful treatment of the CTD knockout mouse and present confirmation by MRS. Methods & Materials: Brain specific knockout and littermate control mice were randomly assigned and treated with on one of three supplements: AgentX (confidential), creatine or maltodextrine as placebo. 1H and 31P MRS data were collected on a 7 T MR system (Bruker). Mice (N016) were studied with MRS after 9 weeks of supplementation. Single voxel 1H data were acquired on a 144 uL voxel covering the cerebrum using a double spin echo sequence. 31P data were acquired with an ISIS sequence from the same voxel. Metabolite quantification was performed with jMRUI and compared between groups and over time with statistical tests for significance (t-tests, ANOVA). Results: Creatine and phosphocreatine levels in the brain were all significantly higher after 9 weeks supplementation of AgentX in knockout mice, compared to creatine and placebo fed knockout mice (Phosphorus MRS [144 uL brain voxel] with phosphocreatine (PCr) (0 ppm) observed only in AgentX treated knockout mice. Adenosine triphospate (ATP) gamma (\u22122.5 ppm), alpha (\u22127.5 ppm) and beta (\u221217 ppm) peaks are noted in all three knockouts.

Data were collected for all children <10 years undergoing evaluation for physical abuse and their contacts. For contacts of abused children, the protocol recommended physical examination for all children <5 years, skeletal survey and physical exam for children <24 months, and physical exam, skeletal survey and neuroimaging for children <6 months old. Results: Among 2,825 children evaluated for abuse, 618 met criteria as \"physically abused\" and these had 477 contacts. For each screening modality, screening was completed as recommended by the protocol in approximately 75% of cases. Of 133 contacts who met criteria for skeletal survey, new injuries were identified in 16 (12.0%). None of these fractures had associated findings on physical examination. Physical examination identified new injuries in 6.2% of 257 eligible, examined contacts. Neuroimaging failed to identify new injuries among 19 imaged, eligible contacts less than 6 months old. Twins were at significantly increased risk of fracture relative to other non-twin contacts (56.3% vs 11.9%, OR 19.9). Conclusions: These results support physical examinations and skeletal survey, regardless of physical examination results, for contacts of abused children <24 months of age. Too few children had cranial imaging to change recommendations to image contact children less than 6 months old. Even for children where no injuries are identified, these results demonstrate that abuse is common among children who share a home with an abused child.

Medical records were reviewed and children with documented abuse or accidental trauma were evaluated. Children with indeterminate injury mechanisms were excluded. Sixty-six patients with rib fractures were included in analysis, 47 due to abusive injury and 19 due to accidental trauma. Children were analyzed for associated intrathoracic, abdominal or intracranial injury, additional fractures and retinal hemorrhage. Results: Abused children were younger (4.7+/\u22126.1 months) than accidentally injured children (18.9+/\u221211.1 months, p< 0.001). Children with rib fractures due to accidental trauma had a higher incidence of intrathoracic injury compared to those due to abusive injury (53% vs 13%,p<0.001). There was no difference in the incidence of abdominal or intracranial injury between groups. Mortality and ICU admission rates were similar. Abused children had a higher total number of rib fractures (mean 5.5 vs 3.0, P<0.009) and were more likely to sustain additional fractures outside of the thoracic cavity (77% vs 63%, P<0.001). Conclusions: Abuse is a more common cause of rib fractures in young children than accidents. Children with rib fractures due to abusive trauma are less likely to have intrathoracic injury compared to those sustaining rib fractures due to accidental trauma. This suggests differences in mechanism of injury between groups.",

            "text": "Pediatric Elbow Fractures: A Different Angle on an Old Topic Shannon Zingula, MD, Pediatric Radiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Kathleen Emery, Christopher G. Anton Purpose or Case Report: The 3 most common elbow fractures classically reported in pediatric orthopedic texts are supracondylar (SC) (50-70%), lateral condylar (LC) (20%), and medial epicondylar (ME) fractures (10%) with fractures of the proximal radius (including but not limited to fractures of the radial neck) being relatively uncommon (5-10%). Our experience at a large children's hospital suggests a different distribution. Purpose: 1) to describe the frequency of different elbow fracture types in a large pediatric population, and 2) to determine the fracture types that were occult on initial radiographs but detected on follow-up. Methods & Materials: Review of medical records identified 468 children, median age 6 years and interquartile range for age of 4-8 years (range, 0.8-18 years) diagnosed with elbow fractures at our institution from October 2010 through July 2011. Initial and follow-up radiographs were reviewed in blinded fashion independently by two experienced pediatric musculoskeletal radiologists to identify fracture type(s) on initial and follow up radiographs. Note was made of fractures identified on follow up only. Results: The most common fractures included SC (n0254, 54%), radial neck (RN) (n080, 17%), and LC fractures (n066, 14%). As compared to classically referenced incidences, RN fractures were seen significantly more (p<0.0001) and ME fractures (n025, 5%) significantly less (p0.0008) than would be predicted. In 26 patients without fracture seen on initial films, occult fractures were seen on follow up; SC (n012, 46%) and RN fractures (n08, 31%) were most common. The frequency of RN fractures compared to the overall group (31% vs. 17%) approached but did not reach statistical significance (p00.06). 34 patients with one fracture had additional fractures seen on follow-up not seen initially with olecranon fractures most frequent (n018, 53%.) This was significantly more common than the number identified on initial radiographs (n033, 7%) (p<0.0001). Conclusions: SC fractures are the most frequent elbow fracture seen initially and in follow up followed by RN and LC fractures in a distribution different than classically described. The relatively high frequency of RN and olecranon fractures detected on follow up speaks to their potentially occult nature. Careful attention to these areas is warranted in patients with initially normal radiographs. Purpose or Case Report: Previous studies have found that fractures involving the spine, hands and feet are rare on skeletal surveys for suspected child abuse, leading some authors to suggest eliminating views of these regions from the initial skeletal survey protocol. The purpose of this study was to assess this recommendation by performing a historical review of these injuries in a population undergoing screen-film based skeletal surveys for suspected abuse.",

            "text": "This cross-sectional, retrospective IRB approved study reviewed the reports of the initial skeletal surveys of all children <2 years of age with suspected abuse imaged between April, 1988 and December, 2001 . Infants underwent skeletal surveys according to ACR standards acquired on a mammographic type screen-film imaging system with at least 13 line pairs per millimeter resolution. Studies in toddlers were performed using a par speed screenfilm system. Results: 62% (225/365) of all skeletal surveys demonstrated positive findings, and 44% (98/225) had >1 fracture. 5.5% (20/365) of all studies had fractures involving the spine, hands or feet. Of all positive skeletal surveys, 8.9% (20/ 225) had fractures involving the spine, hands or feet, and 20.4% (20/98) of all patients with >1 fracture on skeletal survey had fractures involving these regions. Conclusions: These data, acquired in the screen-film era, suggest that fractures of the spine, hands and feet may not be rare in infants and toddlers in cases of suspected child abuse. The benefits of eliminating views of these regions from the initial skeletal survey should be carefully weighed against the cost of missing these potentially important injuries in at-risk pediatric populations. Purpose or Case Report: Dating fractures is critical in cases of suspected infant abuse, but there are little scientific data to guide radiologists, and dating is generally based on personal experience and conventional wisdom. We previously reported a scientific scheme for dating fractures in infants based on an analysis of subperiosteal new bone and callus formation in birth-related clavicular fractures. We hypothesize that when used as a guide this system can significantly improve the ability of radiologists to accurately date fractures in young infants. Methods & Materials: 103 radiographs of presumed birthrelated clavicular fractures in infants 0-3 months were reviewed by 2 pediatric radiologists with 2 (reader A) and 15 (reader B) years experience in two reading sessions separated by one year. For the first read, no guidelines were provided. Training was carried out prior to the second session, and readers were given the dating scheme as a guide during fracture analysis. Readers were asked to provide an estimate of the minimum and maximum fracture age in both sessions. The primary outcome was whether or not the reader's estimated range for fracture age included the actual fracture age. A secondary outcome was the width of the estimate of fracture age. These outcomes were compared across the two reading sessions. Results: The rate of correct response significantly increased after training for each reader (reader A: 66% to 89%, p<.0001; reader B: 76% to 86%, p0.041). The width of estimated fracture age after training was significantly smaller for each reader (reader A: mean width 17 days to 13 days, p<.0001; reader B: 25 days to 15 days, p0.001). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the ability of a radiologist to accurately date fractures can improve significantly when provided with a scientifically based system outlining patterns of fracture healing. This scheme can be applied in radiologic practice and may prove particularly useful in cases of suspected abuse, where fracture dating often has forensic implications. Purpose or Case Report: To demonstrate the acute and subacute features of proximal femoral physeal fractures in the abused child. Also to demonstrate how to recognize this injury in patients with unossified femoral heads.",

From these 254 patients, the cases of proximal femur growth plate fractures were identified. Results: 7 patients with proximal femur growth plate fractures were identified for a prevalence of 2.8%. One patient had bilateral proximal femoral fractures, for a total of 8 fractures in 7 patients. 5 were boys, 2 were girls with ages ranging from 2.5 mos to 2 yrs 2mos. In 4 patients, the fracture was revealed on imaging performed because of refusal to bear weight; in the other 3 patients, the fracture was found during imaging for the skeletal survey. The fracture was on the left side in 7 cases and on the right side in 1 (the patient with bilateral fractures). In all of the fractures, there was lateral displacement of the femoral shaft. In 3 fractures, the femoral head was not yet ossified simulating the appearance of a dislocation. Location of the femoral head in the hip joint was verified by ultrasound or CT (CT abdomen had already been done in 1 patient) thus delineating the presence of a physeal fracture. 6/8 fractures were Salter-Harris I and the other 2 were Salter-Harris II fractures. The fracture was acute in 2 cases and subacute in 6 cases. In these 6 subacute cases, periosteal reaction and/or calcifying subperiosteal hemorrhage was present in 3, and irregularity and scalloping of the metaphysis was present in the other 3. Conclusions: Proximal femoral growth plate fractures are quite uncommon in non-accidental trauma. The injuries are typically Salter-Harris I or II fractures, seen more often in the healing phase. In the presence of an unossified femoral head, the laterally displaced femoral shaft can simulate hip dislocation; this can be clarified with hip sonogram. Purpose or Case Report: In recent years, metal stents have been used to overcome airway obstruction in children for whom no better surgical option is available. These devices are not designed for use in the airway, however, and may cause significant complications. Bioabsorbable airway stents may avoid some of the problems associated with metal stents.",

Custom-made polydioxanone stents of various sizes (Ella DV, Ella, Czech Republic) were used. Results: Twelve stents were inserted in the airways of seven children. Indications were: recurrent obstruction after slide tracheoplasty (2), persistent airway compression after correction of a congenital cardiac lesion (2), collapse of stem cell supported tracheal homograft, tracheomegaly following fetal balloon insertion, and syndromic tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). Eleven stents (diameters 6 to 12 mm) were placed in the trachea and one in the left main bronchus. Two stents had to be removed and replaced for technical reasons (one was too long and the other too narrow). The child with syndromic TBM died when treatment was withdrawn because she could not be weaned from the ventilator. The remaining children are alive at a median follow-up of nine months (range 1 to 17 months). The granulation tissue response was similar to that seen after placement of metal stents. The stents were observed to absorb gradually over a period of approximately three months, requiring serial stenting in two children. Conclusions: Bioabsorbable airway stents are more difficult to insert than metal stents. They cause similar early complications, especially granulation tissue formation, but appear to avoid potential long-term complications of metal stents, including vascular erosion and growth limitation.

Tumor volume was measured from available CT or MRI imaging before and after embolization. Pre-and postembolization symptoms and creatinine levels were documented. Results: 37 patients had available follow-up imaging at a mean of 63 months post-embolization. The mean preembolization tumor volume was 581 mL and postembolization was 284 mL; median decrease in volume was 76%. Using the Schwartz method, the mean glomerular filtration rate before embolization was calculated to be 95.75 mL/min/1.73 m2. After embolization the mean value was statistically unchanged at 101.97 mL/min/1.73 m2. None of the patients experienced renal hemorrhage or symptom recurrence during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Selective embolization of renal AMLs in patients with TSC decreases tumor volume, relieves symptoms and reduces the risk of future hemorrhage while preserving renal function. ETOH was injected percutaneously with 25 G needle; transductal ablation performed through a 4 F micropuncture sheath. Drug volumes, technical difficulties, percentage reduction in saliva production, family reported clinical significance, and complications were recorded. Results: Salivary gland ablation (SGA) included bilateral SMG and SLG ablation without parotid gland ablation in 20 cases, and with unilateral parotid gland ablation in 4 cases. One case of bilateral parotid gland ablation following surgical resection of bilateral SMGs. Mean ETOH dose for SMG04.2 ml, and 3.1 ml for SLG. One case of focal skin necrosis was noted; no other complications. Patient families reported response to SGA in 24/25 cases (96%) with mean saliva production of 66%. Greatest health and family impact was reported with elimination of hospitalizations for recurring aspiration pneumonia (2 cases), elimination of choking in bed (3 cases) , and improved patient sense of self-hygiene in 8 cases. One complication occurred with temporary marginal mandibular nerve paralysis (resolution in 6 months). Conclusions: Percutaneous and transductal SGA is feasible, safe, and effective in this small patient series, offering an alternative to surgical salivary gland resection, or treatment option following failed surgical intervention.",

Patients' demographic data, primary diagnosis, referring team's clinical suspicion, lesion's anatomical location, tissue adequacy for pathology, final diagnosis and clinical follow up were reviewed. Aspects of starting a program of MR-guided procedures, safety concerns, imaging and technical challenges, and MR compatible materials were also addressed. Results: To date, 7 procedures (5 bone biopsies, 1 soft tissue biopsy and 1 pre-surgical needle localization) were performed in 6 patients during 9 months. There were 4 girls and 2 boys with a mean age of 10.2 years (3y5mo-17 yrs). One patient had a Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, 1 Cardiofacial Syndrome, 1 Wilm's tumor and 3 had no previous medical issues. The clinical suspicion for 2 procedures in 2 patients was metastatic disease and for 5 procedures in 4 patients was primary malignancy or infection. Lesions were located in the tibia (2-metaphysis and diaphysis), femur (2 -metaphysis and epiphysis), thigh (1-soft tissues), sacrum (1) and retroperitoneum (1). All biopsies provided adequate tissue for diagnosis. Needle localization and hook deployment was also accurate. Malignancy was excluded in all patients. Final diagnosis included 1 Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO), 3 Osteomyelytis, 1 fibrous tissue, 1 Osteoid Osteoma, and 1 scar tissue. Mean follow up was 6.6 months. No patient required a second procedure to confirm the diagnosis. Conclusions: MR with its unique soft tissue resolution and lack of ionizing radiation is an excellent method to guide interventions in children. One of the greatest advantages of this method is the precise target localization especially in lesions located in the bone marrow or lesions better identified on MR. Special safety measures, specific MR compatible material (needles, surgical instruments), dedicated imaging techniques to reduce or increase material/needle artifact and careful technique are paramount. 2006-2011. 11 M, 15 F; 2 .5-59 months, mean 8.3 months, median 5 months, mode 5 months. Sonographic approach expanded as our experience grew over 71 months. 25 studies performed by a single pediatric radiologist. Bilateral sonography included: interscalene and supraclavicular neck, nerve roots at neural foramina, cervical spinal canal, diaphragm during spontaneous respiration, rhomboid muscle, serratus anterior muscle, posterior shoulder, all performed and interpreted blind to other imaging. Results: Interscalene and supraclavicular neck evaluated in all patients. All exhibited echogenic interscalene portion of brachial plexus.Size and extent of traction neuroma varied. Nerve roots at foramina noted in axial and coronal planes. In 11 cases enlarged root(s)noted. Cervical spinal canal studied in 19 patients: cord oscillated normally, no syrinx, cord concentric in canal. Intracanalicular traction pseudomeningoceles on concurrent CT myelography or MRI were not apparent on US. In 2 cases a \"clumped\" retracted nerve root on the cervical cord was later found to correspond to a pseudo-meningocele on CT myelogram. Otherwise, cervical spinal canal US was unremarkable in 24 cases. Diaphragm motion was evaluated in 23 patients during spontaneous respiration; no phrenic nerve palsy. Rhomboid muscle was evaluated for atrophy in 16 patients; 4 had atrophy. The rhomboids are innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve which arises solely from C5, prior to C5 joining the brachial plexus. Intact rhomboid indicates that the central C5 root is intact. Serratus anterior muscle, innervated by the long thoracic nerve (C5,C6,C7), was evaluated for atrophy in 12 patients; 6 had atrophy. Dynamic evaluation of the posterior shoulder looking for posterior laxity was evaluated in 10 patients; 4 had laxity. Posterior shoulder dislocation or subluxation is a known sequela of brachioplexopathy which sometimes requires muscle transfer when the child is older.",

And a new probe with high frequency has been developed which can be applied for pediatric patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability of shear-wave velocity (SWV) at various depths using different frequencies to suggest standard measurement in ARFI elastography. Methods & Materials: ARFI elastography of both the elasticity phantom and normal liver was performed at different depths (2-5 cm) with convex (1-4 MHz) and linear (4-9 MHz) probes. Ten valid SWV measurements at each depth were performed. It was repeated ten times with the phantom and it was done in 8 healthy volunteers (M:F03:5, age 20-34 years; mean 25.5). The mean value and standard deviation of SWV were calculated. Results: In both the elasticity phantom and the liver, variability of SWV was different between the depths in both probes. The depth with lower variability in the phantom was 4 and 5 cm with the convex probe and 2 cm with the linear probe. In the liver, the depth with lower variability was 4 cm with the convex probe and 3 and 4 cm with the linear probe. In comparison of two probes, the linear probe showed lower variability at 2 and 3 cm depth in the phantom and at 3 cm depth in the liver whereas the convex probe showed it at 4 cm depth in both the phantom and the liver. Conclusions: In ARFI elastography, measurement of depth shows different variability in both low and high frequency probes. To obtain the most reliable measurement of SWV, using high frequency probe is recommended for 2-3 cm depth and using low frequency probe is recommended for 4-5 cm depth.

            "text": "Methods & Materials: This retrospective review examined the computed tomography (CT) reports of all pediatric patients referred to our tertiary care children's hospital over a 17 month period (1/1/2009-5/31/2010). The outside reports and the requested second interpretation reports were compared and their content categorized as \"agreement\" vs. \"disagreement: major or minor\". A representative sample of 92 major disagreements in which there was reliable followup information was correlated with the final diagnosis to determine if there was added value provided by the reinterpretation. Results: CT scans from 732 patients were submitted for reinterpretation. Disagreements were found in 301/732 cases (41.1%); with 50.5% (152/301) classified as major disagreements. Among the 427 neurologic cases, major disagreements occurred in 53 patients (12.4%) and minor disagreements in 92 patients (21.5%). Among the 305 body scans, major disagreements occurred in 99 cases (32.5%) and minor disagreements in 57 cases (18.7%). In the cohort of cases reviewed for final diagnosis, the second read interpretation was more accurate in 90.2% of cases with a p-value of <0.0001 (neurologic 84.4%, p0<0.0001; body 95.7%, p0<0.0001). Conclusions: In our review, discrepancy rates between community and tertiary care radiologists in interpretation of pediatric CT scans were substantial, with discrepancies occurring in more than 40% of cases. Further review of the cases for final diagnosis, showed that a significant number of the tertiary care interpretations were more accurate. Possibilities that may account for this discrepancy include subspecialty training and elapsed time since performance of the study, which might provide additional clinical data in some cases. Diagnostic CT scans performed at outside institutions should not be repeated considering added radiation burden to the child and additional expense. Our data indicates there is added value to the reinterpretation which impacts the accuracy of the report (as assessed by the final diagnosis), and should be recognized by payors as integral to optimal patient care.",

We focused on the most common examinations (98% of all radiographs) and assigned each an estimated equivalent dose based on published literature: chest and abdomen021.3 micro Sieverts (\u03bcSv), one-view chest013.3 \u03bcSv, abdomen013.5 \u03bcSv, twoview chest026.6 \u03bcSv, two-view abdomen027 \u03bcSv. We then calculated a cumulative equivalent dose (CED) for each infant based on the number of each type of examination they received. Descriptive statistics were generated to depict the distribution of number of examinations and CED. Results: Over five years, 2,626 infants cared for in our NICU received at least one radiograph of the chest and/or abdomen. The number of examinations obtained on these infants was 9.6, 4, 1, 137 (mean, median, minimum, maximum). The 1st quartile was 1 and the 3 rd quartile was 11 examinations. The cumulative equivalent dose these infants received was 157.9, 61.2, 13.3, 2, 092.2 \u03bcSv (mean, median, minimum, maximum) . The 1st quartile was 21.3 and the 3 rd quartile was 61.2 \u03bcSv. Two hundred infants (7.6% of the study population) received a CED of over 500 \u03bcSv. Conclusions: Descriptive statistics provide a valuable assessment for the broad range of radiation that infants receive in the NICU. Although the distribution is skewed towards a low level of exposure, a subset of patients (7.6%) received a CED of over 500 \u03bcSv. Identification of factors that cause infants to enter this group will be important for future dose reduction strategies.",

He had mild tachypnea without cyanosis. His oral intake was adequate with no evidence of failure to thrive. He was referred to a pediatric cardiologist who performed an ECG and a transthoracic echocardiogram. The ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at 135 beats per minute with no abnormalities. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a 25 x 25 x 14 mm homogeneous mass originating from the anterior free wall of the right ventricle, and mild dilation of the right ventricle. Mild dynamic subpulmonary stenosis and a secundum atrial septal defect were also noted. Although the murmur was significantly louder at one month follow-up, a repeat echocardiogram did not reveal any increase in the size of the mass. At 2 months of age, a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) study under general anesthesia was performed. CMRI revealed a 16 x 21 x 22 mm cardiac tumor that was causing narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract. The tumor was hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T1weighted imaging, with positive delayed enhancement. These findings, along with the size and location of the mass, are consistent with a diagnosis of a cardiac fibroma. Chest MRA, that was also performed, showed normal extracardiac vascular anatomy with no evidence of peripheral branch pulmonary stenosis. Cardiac fibromas do not usually increase in size; however, the concern is the child's risk of arrhythmias. Frequent Holter monitoring was recommended for this patient. Considerations were also made for an electrophysiology study in the next 1-2 years to determine the risk of ventricular ectopy. At that point, the patient can be assessed for the possibility of resection of the fibroma. Purpose or Case Report: Treatment of pulmonary atresia is complex and demands intricate solutions. One solution is the creation of a conduit between the right ventricle and the main pulmonary artery. The lifespan of these conduits is limited by progressive occlusion over time, which can be treated with endovascular stent placement in lieu of surgical re-intervention. However, these stents are at high (40%) risk for fracture, typically at the stent waist. The radiologist should be aware of this complication, as they may be the first to identify it on chest radiograph. The purpose of this electronic poster is to familiarize radiologists with this entity by presenting 3 cases of stent fracture and migration. Methods & Materials: Over a 6 month period, we identified three children with RV-PA stent fractures and associated stent migrations on chest radiography. Imaging analysis was focused on the appearances of these fractured stents. Patient management and outcomes were reviewed. Results: Three children, 2 males, 1 female (ages 4, 3, and 3 years) were found to have asymptomatic RV-PA conduit stent fractures with fragment migration. One chest xray was performed in the ER for fever and cough; one was pre-op for GI surgery; one was done to confirm abnormal findings seen on a routine cardiac echo. The time between stent placement and fracture detection ranged from 1 to 22 months. Two patients had stent fractures and embolizations to the right ventricle that required open surgery to remove stent fragments. The third patient had embolization to both pulmonary arteries, but did not require treatment. All patients did well. Conclusions: Stent fractures and migrations are a relatively common complication of RV-PA conduit stent placement. Pediatric radiologists need to be aware of this complication in order to provide value-added interpretations. Purpose or Case Report: We describe the case of a 23 week stillborn fetus with a 5.5 cm diameter craniopharyngioma detected by ultrasonography. A G1P0 woman in her third decade had ultrasonographic examination showing hydrocephalus, polyhydramnios and an intracerebral mass. The nature of the mass was uncertain and intracerebral hemorrhage was considered. The pregnancy was terminated at 23 weeks gestation. At postmortem examination the decedent was a 650 g male fetus with a head circumference of 24.5 cm and a crown-rump length of 21.8 cm. Anterior and posterior fontanelles appeared large. No other external abnormality was found. The placenta was unremarkable and cytogenetics on placental tissue showed a normal male karyotype. Examination of fetal viscera was remarkable for mildly underweight adrenal glands (0.75 g, expected 1.5 g) and hepatomegaly (66.4 g, expected 21.7 g). Intracranial CSF was increased in volume. There was a suprasellar 5.5 cm diameter somewhat gritty, but smooth-surfaced tumor. The brain and tumor together weighed 135 g. The floor of the cranium and sella turcica were grossly normal. Histologic examination of the tumor showed an adamantinomatous type craniopharyngioma with characteristic epithelium, stellate reticulum, focal keratinizing squamous epithelium and calcification.",

Purpose or Case Report: Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder causing hamartomatous proliferation in number of organ systems. Because the classical triad of epilepsy, mental retardation and adenoma sebaceum is not commonly seen on clinical examination, imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberous sclerosis. Central nervous system features of TS include subependymal nodules, cortical tubers, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, white matter bands and cysts. In patients with TS, cerebral involvement in the form of subependymal nodules is seen in 95% to 100% and white matter abnormalities are noted in 40% to 90% of cases. Knowledge of expected radiological features is thus important in making the correct diagnosis. Recent studies have indicated that earlier appearance of brain lesions indicate a greater risk of mental retardation and a more severe clinical course. We present a case of a 23-day-old neonate who was referred to us with concerns for hydrocephalus. The cranial ultrasound demonstrated multiple echogenic subependymal nodules of varying sizes and mild asymmetry of the ventricles. The differential diagnosis included TS, TORCH infections, and X-linked subependymal heterotropia. Areas of increased echogenicity were noted within the white matter of the left frontal lobe, which favored TS. Subsequently, an MRI was performed to validate these findings and assess for additional white matter lesions. The MRI showed classic manifestations of TS that included periventricular lesions and streaky, linear, wedge-shaped hyperintensities on FLAIR imaging. A noncontrast CT scan was also performed which revealed classic calcified subependymal nodules. Cardiac rhabdomyoma and renal angiomyolipoma are the other recognized manifestations of TS and were respectively excluded by subsequent echocardiogram and renal ultrasound.",

Merrow, MD, Radiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, carl.merrow@cchmc.org; Jason S. Frischer, Anne W. Lucky Purpose or Case Report: Pyloric atresia (PA) is an uncommon disorder, accounting for 1% of congenital gastrointestinal atresias. Up to 55% of cases have associated anomalies, the most common of which is epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Prenatal findings have been reported sonographically for each of these anomalies, both in isolation and in the rare case of association. A case of isolated PA has been reported by fetal MRI. We present the first reported case of PA with EB diagnosed by fetal MRI with corroborative postnatal imaging and surgical findings. The mother of this child was initially referred to the Fetal Care Center of Cincinnati at 21 weeks gestation for a possible myelomeningocele diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound at an outside facility. These ultrasound images were not available for review at the time of our workup. A fetal MRI was the first study to be obtained at our institution. The MRI showed no myelomeningocele or brain anomalies. The stomach was moderately enlarged throughout the exam and did not empty. Subjective polyhydramnios was also noted. No duodenal dilation was seen, and there was minimal fluid in the distal bowel loops. This constellation of findings raised concern for pyloric atresia, resulting in a careful search for any sign of epidermolysis bullosa due to a known association of these disorders. Prominent debris was seen layering dependently in the amniotic fluid and in the dilated fetal stomach, and the external ears were abnormally small and misshapen. The PA-EB association was proposed as the underlying diagnosis based on our MRI findings. It was also postulated that skin blistering over the lumbosacral spine at the time of the prior outside ultrasound could have mimicked a myelomeningocele, thus prompting the referral to our center. At delivery, the baby had numerous skin defects, and the ears were malformed. An abdominal radiograph obtained after nasogastric tube placement and air injection showed no gas beyond the stomach. A pyloric ultrasound showed a distended stomach without a patent pyloric channel to the duodenal bulb, consistent with pyloric atresia. A skin biopsy confirmed epidermolysis bullosa, and the patient underwent a resection of the PA with gastroduodenostomy. The baby subsequently expired less than two weeks later, most likely due to sepsis based on wound cultures and autopsy results. Our case demonstrates the ability of fetal MRI to diagnose this rare condition and highlights the key imaging manifestations of the PA-EB association. Disclosure: Dr. Merrow has indicated that he is an author for Amirsys and receives a royalty accordingly. Purpose or Case Report: We demonstrate a case where the changing position of the contrast filled appendix lead to the diagnosis of malrotation, with review of the embriology of intestinal rotation. A newborn preterm female presented with a golf ball sized umbilical mass, that reduced by itself, thought to represent an umbilical hernia vs omphalocele. She was unstable to undergo an upper GI exam under fluoroscopy, therefore a limited contrast study was performed at bedside and was inconclusive for malrotation. Subsequent NICU radiographs showed changing position of the appendix filled with residual contrast, visiting all quadrants of the abdomen in a random pattern over a few days period. This confirmed our suspicion for malrotation. It is well know that in malrotation the position of the cecum can be variable, most commonly located in the right upper quadrant or left lower quadrant. To our knowledge it has not been described yet that the changing position of the appendix can lead to the diagnosis of malrotation. Through this case we display the embriology of the intestinal rotation and the radiologic signs of malrotation.",

The spectrum of post transplant complications has been previously described, primarily utilizing ultrasound. As MRI has become a more widely used technique in pediatric imaging, and ultrasound findings may be non-specific, knowledge of MR imaging patterns is an important adjunct in the post-transplant evaluation. We present a spectrum of complications, including vascular, biliary, hepatic parenchymal, and systemic complications. Methods & Materials: Using an electronic record system, we identified pediatric patients with prior liver transplantation who subsequently underwent abdominal MRI at our institution and were found to have a post transplant complication. Patient management and outcomes were reviewed. Results: Our review of a subset of the available patients shows vascular complications to be the most commonly encountered abnormality at our institution, including hepatic artery stenosis/thrombosis, and portal vein stenosis/ thrombosis, cavernous transformation of the portal vein. Biliary complications were relatively common, including bilary stenoses and bilomas. Hepatic parenchymal and systemic complications, such as PTLD, were less common.

Dobbs, MD , Radiology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, matthew.dobbs@vanderbilt.edu; Sumit Pruthi, Stephanie E. Spottswood Purpose or Case Report: Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a relatively rare pediatric liver disease due to a genetic mutation (ABCB11 gene on chromosome 2q24-31) in a bile salt export protein causing cholestasis leading to chronic inflammation within the biliary system. The diagnosis is made clinically with detection of a low GGT in the face of an elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. One of the 3 subtypes, Type 2, was shown in 2006 to be highly related to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The vast majority in children in this study developed HCC at less than 2 years of age. Radiological contribution to the management of these chronic liver disease patients is to perform surveillance imaging to detect HCC. Due to the rarity of this condition, almost no reports exist in the radiological literature describing the imaging features or management of this condition. Our presentation will review the imaging findings in our small population of PFIC Type 2 patients on US, CT, and MRI. We will also review suggested surveillance imaging techniques and imaging algorithms.",

However, over the last decade with advancement in imaging, several distinctive imaging features specific to renal tumors have been recognized which aid in their classification as being distinct pathologically. We present a case of Rhabdoid Tumor where in the primary tumor arose from the kidney. It had classical imaging features of Wilms tumor. We want to highlight that even with the most sophisticated imaging techniques, specific renal tumors cannot always be diagnosed with preoperative imaging and how this alters the management and prognosis for child with a renal mass. In our case, the postoperative findings, pathology and immunohistochemical techniques confirmed a Rhabdoid Tumor. Differentiation of these two tumors is essential since in patients with Rhabdoid Tumor survival is poor with 4-year overall survival rates of 42% for stages I and II and 16% for stages III, IV, and V. On imaging, there are several features that suggest the diagnosis of rhaboid tumor. These include subcapsular fluid collections, linear calcifications outlining tumor lobules, and vascular invasion. Also, a pertinent feature of rhabdoid tumor due to its aggressive nature is the presence of lung metastasis (83%) and synchronous malignant brain lesions (15%). These findings were not present on our case, which led us in formulating a diagnosis of Wilms. Our patient is unusual in the fact that the local renal findings and absence of metastasis, synchronous malignant lesions, and vascular invasion led us to an incorrect diagnosis of Wilms tumor. In conclusion, we would like to stress that diagnosis of rhabdoid tumor of the kidney on imaging presents a challenge because of its imaging similarity to Wilms tumor.",

Mosse, Jill P. Ginsberg, Kevin E. Meyers Purpose or Case Report: Neuroblastoma (Nbl) is the most common extracranial solid malignancy of childhood. With current therapy, the prognosis and long term survival of patients affected by this condition has dramatically improved. Nevertheless, the treatment for Nbl may account for some complications further in life. In patients with neuroblastoma, acute renal failure can occur usually as a result of a thrombotic microangiopathy associated with bone marrow transplantation. In addition, end-stage renal disease has been reported in long-term survivors of Nbl. This exhibit describes and illustrates the first case series of five patients with treated Nbl in whom the imaging features of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) developed over time, and in some cases, as progressive renal failure ensued. Methods & Materials: Medical and imaging records were reviewed (IRB approved) of patients with treated Nbl in whom PKD became apparent during the course of followup imaging. Results: Five patients displayed findings of PKD on US and/or CT. Three of the five patients (where images were available) had normal renal imaging at time of Nbl diagnosis. The mean age at Nbl diagnosis was 2.4 years (range 1.3-3.3 yr). The mean age at time PKD was detected was 14.6 years (range 8-18 yrs). None of the patients had a family history of PKD, or had previously undergone dialysis. All patients received chemotherapy and total body irradiation prior to bone marrow transplantation. Four patients survived Nbl therapy but eventually developed end-stage renal disease. Conclusions: An association between acquired PKD and Nbl has not been previously reported. The etiology of this observation is still unclear, but a toxic insult is likely to account for the renal changes. Further research is needed to establish the epidemiology, prognosis, and etiology of this association.",

In our practice the thread of the retention anchor suture is cut at 14 days and the metallic portion passes pre rectum. We report an interesting and very rare migration of the metallic portion of the retention anchor suture in post-primary gastrostomy tube insertion. An 8-month-old girl, with a mitochondrial disease and severe hypotonia underwent percutaneous gastrostomy placement. During the procedure the retention anchor suture thread snapped and the metallic portion of the suture remained within the stomach. Day1 post procedure, the child became uncomfortable, so a gastrostomy tube check was performed. The suture was not visible in the abdomen on abdominal x-ray or fluoroscopically. On close review of the images, the suture was found projected over the distal esophagus. Initial impression was the anchor suture had refluxed into the esopahgeal lumen. Careful attempts were made to remove it along with the nasogastric tube, from above under fluoroscopic control. However on withdrawal of the nastogastric tube, the retention anchor suture moved enbloc with the nasogastric tube. Once removed the retention anchor suture was confirmed to be within the nasogastric tube. This case illustrates the importance of examining the chest X-ray carefully before assuming a retention anchor suture has passed. To understand the appropriate post procedural radiographic workup and its technique for timely diagnosis. 3. To learn the potential complications of delayed diagnosis.",

We report an extremely rare case of a retroperitoneal synovial sarcoma masquerading as retroperitoneal hematoma in a 16-year-old white female with non-traumatic back pain and non-contrast enhanced CT findings of right quadratus lumborum and psoas region presumed hematoma. Coagulation studies revealed Factor XI deficiency also known as Hemophilia C. However, on follow-up imaging, the presumed retroperitoneal bleed persisted and a subsequent MR examination revealed a solid enhancing mass. CT, MR, and FDG-PET findings as well as a brief histopathology are discussed. Our case is rare in the regards that the tumor occurred in an uncommon retroperitoneal location in a pediatric patient and was mimicking a retroperitoneal hematoma which posed a significant diagnostic challenge. Despite a rare entity, synovial sarcoma among other sarcomatous lesions maybe considered in the differential consideration of a spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma even in hemophiliac patients.",

MRI has a great role in the pediatric population owing to its inherent advantages namely lack of radiation, high tissue specificity, and high diagnostic yield at the level of the entire body under a single sedation. Unlike the application of WBMRI in the assessment of metastasis and bone marrow involvement in leukemia, its role in systemic diseases is yet to be further investigated. Certain diseases such as CRMO are very often multifocal. The extent of osteonecrosis in patients on steroids, dermatomyositis and the lesions related to child abuse are very often wide spread in the skeleton. We intend to present some of the findings of these pediatric systemic and multifocal diseases on WBMRI. Chronic Relapsing Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO): CRMO can be acute or chronic and is multifocal. The abnormality manifests as high signal intensity. WBMRI can guide for the best site for biopsy and provides monitoring for response to treatment. Osteonecrosis: Only few small studies evaluated the usefulness of WBMRI in the diagnosis of both the symptomatic and asymptomatic sites of osteonecrosis in ALL patients on steroid therapy. WBMRI is more sensitive than conventional radiographs. The abnormalities are typically geographical areas of high STIR signal intensity. Myopathies: WBMRI has also the role of detecting the extent of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies such as dermatomyositis in the entire skeleton. Child abuse: WBMRI has a low sensitivity for the highly specific fractures that are pathognomonic for child abuse. Conclusions: WBMRI is a useful examination in the pediatric patient that is radiation free, quick and allows imaging of the entire body. It is an adjunct to dedicated MRIs to look for multifocality and extent of systemic diseases such as CRMO, osteonecrosis in patients on steroids and dermatomyositis. It has a great potential as a screening examination but at the same time can detect both the symptomatic and the asymptomatic lesions in the bone marrow and muscles that are otherwise not seen on conventional radiography. It also allows guidance for biopsy and monitors response to treatment.",

Nagaraj, MD, The Ohio State University Medial Center, usha.nagaraj@osumc.edu; Brent Adler Purpose or Case Report: Hydranencephaly is a congenital central nervous system disorder manifested by the replacement of the cerebral hemispheres with a thin membranous sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid and necrotic debris. Hemihydranencephaly is an extremely rare brain condition in which the vascular anomaly is unilateral, with fewer than 10 cases previously reported in the literature. This is a case of a 4-month-old male who presented to the ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible leukocoria of the right eye. The patient had a history of a difficult vaginal delivery that required forceps delivery with possible associated trauma to the right eye. Dilated fundoscopic exam revealed retinal calcifications. This caused a clinical concern for retinoblastoma and CT and MRI of the orbits were obtained. CT demonstrated profound dilatation of the left lateral ventricle with only a thin rim of cortex surrounding it. There was some midline shift to the right with mild dilatation of the right lateral ventricle. The thalami and brainstem were spared. There were multiple soft tissue bodies that layered in the dependent portion of the left lateral ventricle, which were isodense to grey matter. MRI revealed similar findings consistent with hemihydranencephaly involving the left cerebral hemisphere. There were multiple round soft tissue masses that measured up to 1 cm in size that layered posteriorly in the left lateral ventricle. These masses were isointense to grey matter on T2 and hyperintense on T1. When the patient was placed with his head turned to the left, these masses moved to the dependent portion of the left lateral ventricle. The orbits were normal on both CT and MR. These soft tissue collections are presumed to be mobile collections of infarcted brain tissue. This unusual appearance has not been described in the radiology literature. We review the CT and MR findings and review the relevant literature. Purpose or Case Report: Citrullinemia type I is a rare inborn error of urea cycle metabolism resulting in hyperammonemia. In the classic form, the newborn presents with poor feeding, vomiting, progressive lethargy and signs of increasing intracranial pressure 3-7 days after birth, rapidly progressing to apnea, coma and death if left untreated. We present a case of a term infant who presented to the hospital on the 5th day of life with a typical history of poor feeding and profound hypotonia. Upon admission he had multiple episodes of apnea and hemodynamic instability prompting intubation and intensive support. Laboratory evaluation revealed multiple abnormalities, most notably, hyperammonemia (910umol/L) and elevated citrulline (>800umol/L). MRI of the brain performed on the 7th day of life showed findings consistent with term hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy with restricted diffusion in bilateral rolandic cortex and subcortical white matter, bilateral caudate heads and lenticular nuclei, bilateral insular cortex, and bilateral cerebral peduncles. The genu of the corpus callosum, bilateral deep frontal white matter, and the left parietal white matter also demonstrated restricted diffusion suggesting infarction secondary to thrombosis of deep intramedullary veins. An area of restricted diffusion in the right parietal cortex was suspicious for superficial venous infarct. Review of the literature reveals that this case of neonatal citrillunemia has unique MRI findings. While our patient had diffusion changes with some shared similarities to the previous two cases in the literature, there are also findings consistent with deep intramedullary venous thrombosis and infarction.",

Only a few cases have been previously described in literature. We describe an extremely rare case of duplicated right internal auditory canal in a six month-old patient with a history of Down syndrome. A six month-old male with Trisomy 21 presented with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The patient failed the newborn hearing screening tests. Past medical history was unremarkable for recurrent ear infections. On focused physical examination, the auricles were normal appearing. External auditory canals were patent bilaterally revealing clear and translucent tympanic membranes. Patient did not reveal a facial palsy. Subsequently, a high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the temporal bone was performed. Duplicated appearance of the right internal auditory canal with separation of facial and vestibulocochlear segments was noted. The facial nerve canal demonstrated normal caliber while there was significant narrowing of the cochlear canal near the fundus. Significant stenosis of the vestibulocochlear segment of the duplicated IAC was identified at the porus acousticus. Dehiscent right posterior semicircular canal was also seen. An enlarged right vestibule was also noted. A single IAC was identified on the contralateral side with significant stenosis at the porus acousticus. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of IAC was recommended which revealed normal appearance of the bilateral cochlear and vestibular nerves. Duplication of the IAC is an extremely rare anomaly involving a redundant osseous canal extending from the cerebellopontine angle through the otic capsule bone toward the labyrinth or cochlea. A duplicated IAC may or may not be associated with congenital sensorineural hearing loss secondary to aplasia or hypoplasia of the vestibulocochlear nerve. To evaluate for structural abnormalities that may preclude cochlear implantation, it is important to evaluate pediatric patients with sensorineural hearing loss radiologically. Although HRCT is the best imaging modality for evaluation of osseous IAC, the IAC contents are best viewed on MRI in oblique sagittal planes of the IAC using a 3-D volumetric steady state sequence.",

Repeat MRIs at 93 h (Case 1) and 75 h (Case 2) were both positive for mild hyperintensity on trace diffusion images, and corresponding reduced diffusion on ADC maps, involving regions of the cortex and juxtacortical white matter in left middle cerebral artery distributions. These findings completely resolved at 3 months in both cases. MR angiograms (MRA) were negative in both cases. Case 1 had a family history of migraines and was found to have an unreported mutation in ATP1A2 gene at a highly conserved location in vertebrates. Case 2 had a family history of HM and was found to have an indeterminant mutation in the CACNA1A gene. Infectious, metabolic and hypercoagubility work up was negative. Case 1 required inpatient rehabilitation and at 1 year follow up was requiring speech therapy. Case 2 resolved completely. In the literature, 6 cases of hemiplegic migraine with neuroimaging changes were reported. All cases had prolonged hemiplegic migraines (symptoms>24 h) and showed cerebral edema with or without restricted diffusion. Conclusions: All eight HM cases in the literature with abnormal findings on neuroimaging had prolonged attacks. MRIs for our two cases and two cases reported in the literature were initially normal at admission. Mild swelling and restricted diffusion developed in our two cases after 24 h, and resolved on follow up MRIs. Subtle findings on diffusion and T2 imaging may lag behind the clinical picture in HM, therefore serial neuroimaging may be useful in individuals with prolonged symptoms. Most cases eventually show resolution clinically and on MRI.",

Nagaraj, MD, The Ohio State University Medical Center, usha.nagaraj@osumc.edu; Daniel Boue, Lisa Martin Purpose or Case Report: Cerebellar heterotopia is a common congenital anomaly frequently encountered in the form of cell rests around the fourth ventricle. However, isolated well-differentiated cerebellar ectopia is extremely rare. Of the 8 previously reported cases in the literature, only 4 have presented as a discrete, extraaxial mass and none have been described in the posterior cranial fossa. We present a case of a 5-year-old male who initially presented with persistent daily headaches. Physical exam including a detailed neurologic exam was within normal limits. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the brain was initially performed, demonstrating no abnormalities. Further work-up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which revealed a well-defined, extra-axial mass superior to the cerebellum and inferior to the tentorium, immediately beneath the vein of Galen. The mass was isointense to grey matter on T1 and T2 sequences and there was no significant enhancement on post-contrast images. There was mass effect on the vermis and the cerebellar tonsils were displaced 3 mm below the foramen magnum. Neurosurgery was consulted and the mass was removed for diagnosis and treatment of the patient's symptoms. The mass was easily identified intra-operatively and gross total resection was accomplished successfully. Pathologic analysis of the mass revealed well-formed cerebellar tissue without evidence of neoplasia. To the best of our knowledge this is the only case of ectopic cerebellum presenting as a discrete extra-axial mass in the posterior cranial fossa. Our case shows that an extra-axial mass that parallels grey matter on all sequences can be a presentation of ectopic cerebellum. We describe the CT and MRI findings, surgical and histopatholgical results and review the relevant literature.",

Kao, MD, MSEE, University of Kansas-Wichita, run4boston@gmail.com; Debbie Desilet-Dobbs Purpose or Case Report: The density (attenuation coefficient) of subdural hemorrhage (SDH) in computed tomography (CT) is important in assessing the acuity of SDHs. An acute SDH is traditionally described as hyperdense and then becoming isodense in approximately 3 weeks when entering the subacute phase. In this report, we document the case of a pediatric patient with the new appearance of an acute SDH within 40 h of the prior CT that was isodense. Greater than 95% of the collection was isodense, with a small focus of hyperdensity. Acute SDHs are known to be isodense to gray matter in patients with anemia (WP Smith, Am J Neurorad 1981). However, the hemoglobin and hematocrit was within normal limits. In addition, acute SDHs that are only a few hours old can have a mixed hyperdense and hypodense appearance because of uncoagulated blood before clotting takes place (J Provenzale, AJR 2007) . Thus, an acute SDH can have an isodense appearance in a non-anemic patient. Radiologists should consider the possibility of an acute SDH with an isodense appearance, especially in case of possible non-accidental trauma where timing of an injury is important.",

Daniel, MD, UT Southwestern / Children's Medical Center Dallas, michael.daniel@utsouthwestern. edu; Lisa Sutton, Sandy Cope-Yokoyama, Neil J. Fernandes Purpose or Case Report: Mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occur infrequently in the adult and are extremely rare in the pediatric population. The occurrence of these lesions in the esophagus is limited to a collection of case reports in the available literature. Most esophageal mesenchymal tumors in the pediatric GI tract are benign leiomyomas. The vast majority of malignant mesenchymal tumors in children are categorized as either sarcomas or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). We report a case of a high grade undifferentiated sarcoma of the distal esophagus in an 11year-old male. While this tumor most closely resembles a GIST, the immunohistochemical profile of the lesion is not typical of any distinct mesenchymal neoplasm. A review of the literature demonstrates a single case report of a likely benign undifferentiated mesenchymal neoplasm of the distal esophagus in an adolescent. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an undifferentiated esophageal sarcoma in a pediatric patient. We provide radiologic and pathologic features of the above lesion, and review the typical imaging and pathologic characteristics of mesenchymal GI neoplasms.",

It has been shown that a variety of health care professionals other than anethesiologists may provide sedation, including advanced practice registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, fellow level trainees, emergency medicine physicians, intensivists, pediatricians and, last but not least, radiologists. Moderate sedation, also called \"conscious sedation\", does generally not require an anesthesiologist as there is usually adequate spontaneous ventilation and no airway intervention required. However, in case of a complication during the imaging study intubation may become necessary. For patients with certain congenital or acquired conditions emergent intubation may be very difficult and should be brought to the attention of an anesthesiologist prior to inducing moderate sedation. The four \"D's\" is a quick way to assess potentially difficult airways that necessitate consultation with anesthesia prior to moderate sedation: Dentition (incisor/tooth size, dental alignment, and macroglossia), Distortion (swelling from infection, tumor, or trauma), Disproportion (hyoid-chin ratio, such as with micrognathia), and Dysmobility (jaw or cervical spine movement issues, i.e. trauma or atlanto-occipital instability). Presence of some of these features may be an indication to consider general anesthesia for sedation; at the very least, anesthesiologist's awareness of a potentially difficult intubation adds to patient safety during moderate sedation. Purpose or Case Report: Lymphangiomatosis describes the presence of multiple lymphangiomas often with multiorgan involvement; typically bones, spleen, mediastinum and lungs. Although lymphangiomatosis has been described in patients ranging from birth up to 80 years, it most frequently presents in childhood. The lesions can occur in any tissue in which lymphatics are normally found, with a predilection for neck and chest involvement. The clinical presentation is variable including pleural or pericardial effusion, hemoptysis, protein wasting enteropathy, peripheral edema, hemihypertrophy and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The coexistence of lytic bone lesions and chylothorax serves as an important diagnostic clue. We describe typical radiographic, CT and MRI findings in the appropritate clinical setting that narrow the differential diagnosis and raise concern for this rare entity as the etiology for the patient's symptoms.",

Osseous and splenic lesions are demonstrated both on CT and MR. Differential diagnosis includes interstitial edema, lymphoma and sarcoidosis. Conclusions: The natural history of pulmonary lymphangiomatosis is characterized by progressive growth and compression of adjacent structures. Therapy should aim to decrease the compressive effects, to control chylous effusions, and to maintain cosmesis. The success of surgical resection is limited by inability to separate lymph collections from normal structures.

Methods & Materials: Cardiac embryology animations were created using modeling clay, a digital camera, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Surface and cross-sectional views were generated, depicting the key events in cardiac embryology: heart tube formation, cardiac looping, chamber division, truncus arteriosus division, and pulmonary venous connection. Example models are shown in Figure 1 . Results: In this lecture, the animations are presented alongside actual embryonic heart photographs. The lecture then uses the embryology knowledge as a basis to explain the common congenital heart diseases and their MRI appearances. Examples of septal defects, ventricular hypoplasia, and transposition of the great arteries are presented, among others. Conclusions: Understanding cardiac embryology is required in order to approach congenital heart disease in a logical fashion. Modeling clay animations are a cheap and easy way to simplify this complex topic.",

Hegde, MD, Arkansas Childrens Hospital, University of Arkansas, shilpavhegde@gmail.com; S. Bruce Greenberg Purpose or Case Report: Dynamic pulmonary computed tomography (DPCT) is a wide-detector CT technique that allows for continuous chest imaging during respiration. When combined with intravenous contrast, the technique is a unique tool for evaluation of cardiopulmonary abnormalities in children with cardiopulmonary abnormalities. The purpose of this poster is to illustrate the technique of DPCT for evaluation of cardiopulmonary disease in children with congenital heart disease and persistent respiratory distress. Methods & Materials: Methods and Materials: 8 DPCT exams with intravenous contrast were performed on 5 infants with a history of congenital heart disease and palliative surgery. Four continuous 350 msec gantry rotations were obtained with respiratory rates set at 40/minute. The imaging was accomplished during the time of a single respiratory cycle. 80 kVp and low mA resulted in effective dose of\u22481.5 mSv. Eight respiratory phases were reconstructed to create 3D and MPR cine loops for evaluation of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Results: Cardiopulmonary abnormalities were detected in all patients. Patency of Sano shunt, Blalock Tausig shunt or patent ductus arteriosus stent was established. Intimal thickening was identified in one Sano shunt. Hypoplastic branch pulmonary arteries were present in 3 infants and pulmonary vein thrombosis in 1 infant. Left bronchomalacia was identified in four of five infants and best or only identified on the expiratory phase of respiration. Left lung air trapping was present in two patients. Conclusions: DPCT with intravenous contrast is the ideal study for evaluation of the post-operative infant with congenital heart disease and persistent respiratory distress.",

Based on the reported adult experience we introduced renal CT angiography (CTA) for the evaluation of renovascular hypertension in mid-2006. Our Institution has a robust, well-established protocol, which results in reproducible, high quality images. We aim to present our imaging strategies for the evaluation of these patients and to discuss and illustrate the role of low-dose CTA with 3-D imaging as a noninvasive alternative in the evaluation of pediatric renovascular hypertension. Methods & Materials: We used our department information system to identify pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) who had documented renovascular hypertension confirmed either by conventional angiography and/or surgery during a 5-year period. We present our protocol and discuss the indications, limitations and benefits of renal CTA. CT thin slice data, obtained employing dose reduction strategies, was reviewed and reconstructed in 2D and 3D renderings. Pertinent US and MR studies as well as demographic and clinical data were reviewed and recorded. Several causes for renovascular hypertension were documented and relevant CT angiographic findings were selected for presentation. Results: Radiation dose ranged 0.58-4 mSv. Fibromuscular dysplasia was the most common diagnosis followed by neurofibromatosis type 1. Vascular pathology included stenoses, beading, occlusions, and aneurysms. Disease was noted in the extraparenchymal renal arteries in approximately 70% of the cases.",

Gross Kelly, Tushar Chandra, Ibrahim S. Tuna, Craig Johnson Purpose or Case Report: The purpose of the exhibit is to illustrate various brain, head and neck massses/vascular anomalies on fetal MRI. We will also briefly discuss the normal fetal brain anatomy as seen on fetal MRI. Methods & Materials: Major indications for fetal MRI include evaluation of inconclusive sonographic findings in cases of CNS malformations. In our institute patients are scanned on 1.5 T MR Scanner. A body surface six channel phased array coil is used to maximize signal to noise. All the scans are checked by a neuroradiologist to make sure adequate 3 plane imaging of the brain or other lesion in question were performed. 3 plane scanning of the fetal body is also performed for the laterality determination of the lesion and also screen for other congenital anomalies. Results: Prenatal USG is frequently inconclusive for evaluation of complex fetal brain and head and neck anomalies. Most studies suggest that MRI after first trimester is safe. In addition, advent of rapid MRI sequences like single shot fast spin echo (ssFSE) have helped in reducing scan time and motion artifacts leading to availability of diagnostic quality images. These have led to increasing use of MRI as supplemental tool to further investigate inconclusive fetal sonographic findings. MRI provides better anatomical delineation of these complex abnormalities. It helps in making appropriate diagnosis with high confidence and aids in appropriate obstetric and prenatal/neonatal surgical planning or intervention. This educational exhibit will illustrate few common fetal anomalies. These will include agenesis of corpus callosum, malformation of cortical development, posterior fossa malformations, ventriculomegaly, in-utero stroke, orbital abnormalities and some fetal neck masses/ vascular malformation. Correlation and confirmation with the postnatal MRI will also be provided for some cases. Conclusions: Technical and therapeutic advances have driven the development of fetal MRI. It is an important adjunctive tool for prenatal imaging in those instances in which a complex anomaly is suspected by sonography, when fetal surgery is contemplated, or when a definitive diagnosis cannot be determined. It has prognostic implications and may help in optimal and timely obstetric and neonatal management. Purpose or Case Report: This educational report will provide a review of the imaging appearance of intradiaphragmatic and subdiaphragmatic pulmonary sequestrations on fetal MRI. The proposed pathophysiology, review of sequestration subtypes, and surgical management options will also be described. Case examples will be provided to illustrate the fetal MR imaging findings of these variants of pulmonary sequestration that help support the diagnosis. Specifically a \"triangle sign\" of T2 hyperintense tissue directed toward the diaphragm will be demonstrated. Illustrative case examples will be placed in the context of a differential diagnosis for subdiaphragmatic masses seen on prenatal imaging. Imaging signs that help make a diagnosis of these pulmonary sequestration variants and separate this entity from other lesions will be emphasized.",

The imaging findings of the two modalities, MRI and US, were correlated with the pattern and severity of the injury and brain maturity. Results: Diffuse white matter abnormalities were observed in 60% of the patients by US or MRI. The ultrasound identified diffuse increased echogenicity which did not show correlation with MRI in 30% of patients. Focal white matter abnormalities were better identified by MRI on non-cavitary leukomalacia which is the most common PVL observed in premature neonates with low birth weight and the most difficult to identified using US. Cavitary leukomalacia showed strong agreement in both methodologies. The MRI identified 6% more cases of intraventricular hemorrhage, however, the corresponding increase in hemorrhage was of minimal clinical significance. In most cases extra axial hemorrhage was better identified by MRI. Conclusions: After viewing this exhibit, the viewer will gain a better appreciation and understanding of the neuroimaging characteristics of hypoxia-ischemia in US and MRI, and thus improving the interpretation of the US which is usually the first imaging modality used to evaluate this patient population. Purpose or Case Report: The most common thoracic lesions found on prenatal imaging, congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), usually have characteristic imaging findings previously described in detail. However, common entities presenting with atypical findings and rarer thoracic entities do occur and can be characterized by fetal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The purpose of this educational exhibit is to show examples of atypical presentations of common thoracic lesions and more unusual thoracic entities on fetal MR. When applicable, prenatal MR is compared with prenatal ultrasound, postnatal imaging, operative findings, or pathology. Methods & Materials: Using a radiology information system database, the reports of all fetal MR exams at our institution from January 2005 through January 2011 were reviewed. When unusual thoracic findings were described in the report, all prenatal and postnatal images (when available) were evaluated. In the cases selected, medical charts were reviewed for operative findings and pathologic reports. Results: The cases to be described, both pulmonary and extrapulmonary in location, include: hybrid lesion in a horseshoe lung, CPAM extending across the midline, bilateral BPS, BPS located within the mediastinum, BPS located within the leaves of the diaphragm, ectopia cordis and CDH as components in Pentalogy of Cantrell, CDH with herniation of liver into the pericardium, elongated esophageal duplication cyst, chest wall lymphatic malformation, and tight double aortic arch causing congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (CHAOS).",

Results: Since 2002, 6 patients (5 girls, 1 boy) have been diagnosed with MMIHS at our institution, including 4 on prenatal MRI and US. The characteristic prenatal imaging findings include marked urinary bladder distension, bilateral pelvicaliectasis, and dilated, tortuous ureters, as well as a diminutive colon containing no or minimal T1W-hyperintense meconium on MRI. Postnatal imaging studies also characteristically demonstrate a massively distended urinary bladder (with no apparent mechanical cause of obstruction) as well as a small, unused colon with dilated, hypoperistaltic small bowel seen proximal to the microcolon. Additional findings which are variably seen include intestinal malrotation, stomach and esophageal hypoperistalsis or aperistalsis, gastroesophageal reflux, and biliary stasis. Conclusions: Although a rare syndrome, the constellation of imaging findings in MMIHS is pathognomonic, and recognition of the classic pattern of findings can allow the radiologist to make a diagnosis of MMIHS in both the in-utero and postnatal setting.

Results: The clinical presentations of our patients, who were all female, were somewhat varied but typically included symptoms of intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis of MMIH syndrome was made in our patients from the first few weeks of life through early childhood. The four patients demonstrated imaging features characteristic of this disease including a very large dilated bladder, severe bilateral hydroureteronephrosis, gaseous distention of the stomach and proximal small bowel, intestinal hypoperistalsis, and a very small colon. The clinical course of these patients that we observed was also quite variable, with some patients dying in neonatal period while another patient continues to do reasonably well at 14 years old after a multi-organ transplant. Conclusions: MMIH syndrome is a rare and frequently lethal disease. The ability of the pediatric radiologist to recognize this constellation of imaging findings can help the clinical team arrive at a diagnosis of MMIH syndrome.

The role of the radiologist is to identify whether or not mechanical obstruction is present; if obstruction is identified on initial radiographs, to determine the level of obstruction, and finally to identify the etiology of obstruction. Initial plain radiographic evaluation also helps to determine the subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic approach. Methods & Materials: A retrospective review of multiple radiographic and fluroscopic examinations in patients with diagnosis of neonatal bowel obstruction was performed at Kentucky Children's Hospital. Multiple examples of classical imaging findings were compiled and placed into a pictorial review. Results: Neonatal intestinal obstruction generally presents with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal distention, vomiting, or failure to pass meconium depending on the level of obstruction and time of occurrence of underlying congenital lesion/atresia in the intrauterine life. Initial plain radiographs of the abdomen reveal dilated bowel loops when obstruction is present. High intestinal obstruction is suspected when only few dilated loops are identified, while multiple dilated bowel loops are seen in low obstruction. Most cases of high obstruction may not need another diagnostic imaging test. All cases of distal intestinal obstruction require water soluble enema to identify the etiology of obstruction. In conditions like functional immaturity of the colon, and meconium ileus water soluble enema is therapeutic and thus surgery can be avoided in most cases. The objective of this presentation is to present an educational exhibit of classical imaging findings of various types of neonatal bowel obstructions, and how to differentiate between them. Conclusions: Bowel obstruction is the most common abdominal emergency in the new born period. Most cases are secondary to a congenital surgical condition and early diagnosis and treatment significantly reduces mortality and morbidity. Radiographic evaluation plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.",

Using a casebased approach, we will demonstrate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as part of a comprehensive MRE protocol for the assessment of IBD in children.",

The role of MRE DWI for the evaluation of pediatric Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) will be reviewed using a case-based approach. Key images from pertinent imaging studies will be identified by searching institutional electronic medical records and presented with relevant clinical data. Results: A review of pediatric MRE examinations suggests DWI can be used to detect the following: 1) small and large bowel segments affected by IBD (both CD and UC) 2) abdominopelvic abscesses (including within the mesentery, body wall, iliopsoas muscle, and liver) 3) abnormal lymph nodes 4) sacroiliitis 5) perianal disease (including abscesses and other penetrating complications). Conclusions: DWI has the potential to play a very important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of pediatric IBD. This MRE technique is particularly useful for detecting a variety of disease-related complications. As the exact meaning of bowel wall restricted diffusion is poorly understood to date, continued investigation will be necessary to determine the clinical and histologic significance of this finding.

Relevant imaging studies were reviewed for known GI manifestations of CF. These imaging studies were correlated with clinical histories and available intraoperative and pathologic findings. Results: CF involvement of the GI tract presents over a wide range of ages, organs involved, and associated symptoms. These manifestations can generally be divided anatomically into those involving the alimentary tract, hepatobiliary system, and pancreas. Alimentary tract manifestations consist of meconium ileus in uncomplicated and complicated forms (with the latter including secondary intestinal atresia, volvulus, and perforation with meconium peritonitisdistal intestinal obstruction syndrome, constipation, rectal prolapse, duodenal fold thickening, and appendiceal dilation. Hepatobiliary disorders secondary to CF include microgallbladder, cholelithiasis, biliary ductal abnormalities, neonatal hepatitis, and cirrhosis (including complications such as portal vein thrombosis and ascites). Pancreatic expressions of CF include fatty infiltration, calcifications, and cysts/ cystosis, frequently in the setting of malnutrition and/or stooling abnormalities. This exhibit will demonstrate the spectrum of clinical and radiologic GI findings in this disease from the fetal and neonatal period through adolescence across a range of imaging modalities. Conclusions: Gastrointestinal manifestations of cystic fibrosis occur frequently in the pediatric population and may be the earliest clinical expression of the disease. Familiarity with the variety of gastrointestinal imaging findings of cystic fibrosis can expedite appropriate diagnosis and therapy, particularly in those children in whom the primary disease is not clinically suspected.",

            "text": "Beyond Acute Appendicitis: Imaging of Additional Pathologies of the Pediatric Appendix Kelly Dietz, MD, Cincinnati Children's Hospital; Arnold C. Merrow, Daniel J. Podberesky, Alexander J. Towbin Purpose or Case Report: Primary acute appendicitis (or appendiceal inflammation caused by a superimposed bacterial infection in the setting of appendiceal obstruction) is by far the most common pathology of the appendix, and imaging evaluations to exclude this diagnosis occur daily in the pediatric radiology setting. The clinical and imaging differential diagnosis in a patient with right lower quadrant pain and suspected appendicitis is a broad but well-recognized list that predominantly involves structures adjacent to the appendix including the ovaries, small and large bowel, and ureters. There are, however, less common pathologies primarily involving the appendix which can create an imaging diagnostic dilemma in the setting of right lower quadrant symptoms. Our goal is to review the imaging and clinical manifestations of these less commonly encountered appendiceal abnormalities. Methods & Materials: Cases of appendices that were abnormal by imaging but ultimately determined not to be due to primary acute appendicitis were collected from clinical encounters by the authors as well as through a search of the radiology and pathology report databases. Clinical course, surgical findings, and pathology reports (if available) were subsequently reviewed through the main hospital medical records system. Results: The collected cases demonstrate a wide range of additional pathologies of the appendix outside of primary acute appendicitis. A variety of imaging modalities were employed in the workup of these cases. Examples reviewed in this exhibit include Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, carcinoid tumor, inguinal hernia with incarceration, retained foreign body, pinworm infestation, and ileocolic intussusception. Conclusions: Despite the frequency of primary acute appendicitis, there is a differential diagnosis when an abnormal appendix is found by imaging. Familiarity with these alternative diagnoses may be particularly helpful in guiding management of the patient whose clinical presentation is not typical for primary acute appendicitis. Methods & Materials: A hospital PACS database search from the past 10 years for patients with BWS. Selected cases, with multimodality imaging, were cross-referenced with pathology reports from patient records database. Results: Intricate abdominal pathologies are depicted utilizing multimodality imaging, such as plain films, US, CT, MRI and PET/CT, and with pathologic correlation. Cases with highlight the following: Liver: hepatoblastoma, nonspecific hepatobiliary cysts, multiple hemangiomas mimicking metastatic disease; adrenal: dysplastic organomegaly mimicking neoplasm; pancreas: diffuse and focal hyperplasia in the setting of hyperinsulinism, organomegaly; renal: neprocalcinosis, including medullary sponge kidney, nephroblastomatosis, organomegaly; adnexal: ectopic paraovarian adrenal tissue mimicking metastatic lymph node; urinary bladder: benign fibro-uroepithelial polyp. Conclusions: Diagnosis of BWS can be difficult when the classic clinical and radiological findings are not present. These few cases highlight the unusual abdominal pathologies, so when detected, a radiologist can aid in the appropriate diagnosis and help guide therapy for these young patients. This poster will discuss pharmaceuticals the FDA considers investigational for their intended use.

Describe the key morphologic features and other pertinent findings using various imaging modalities. Correlate pathologic and radiologic findings. Methods & Materials: Illustrate the various imaging characteristics of pathologically proven pancreatic masses including pseudocyst, pancreatoblastoma, solid pseudopapillary tumor, acinar cell carcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, pancreatic neuroblastoma, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Correlate pathologic and radiologic findings. Identify the key imaging features that allow narrower differential diagnosis. Results: Pancreatoblastoma and solid pseudopapillary tumor are the more commonly encountered pediatric primary pancreatic tumors. Both are bulky and heterogeneously enhancing tumors with solid and cystic elements. Pancreatoblastoma occurs more commonly in young children. Internal hemorrhage and fibrous capsule favor solid pseudopapillary tumor which more commonly occurs in adolescent girls. Ductal adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma and an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, which were pathologically proven in our pediatric patients, are exceedingly rare entities. The imaging findings of these cases and their pathology when available will be presented, as well as a quick literature review of these rare tumors.

The MR imaging characteristics of the patient's primary hepatoblastoma pre-and post-therapy (when available) and post treatment findings (when available) were reviewed. Results: 22 MRI studies in 9 different patients were reviewed. The patients ranged in age from 4 months to 12 years. 6 patients had pre and post treatment evaluation with Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI, 1 patient had only pretreatment evaluation and 2 patients had only post treatment evaluation. 6 of the hepatoblastomas did not take up Gd-EOB-DTPA during the hepatocyte phase and were therefore low signal intensity during the hepatocyte phase of imaging. This was useful in the pretreatment evaluation of hepatoblastoma, particularly in defining the relationship of the tumor to hepatic and portal veins. Post treatment Gd-EOB-DTPA imaging allowed characterization of the biliary anatomy and demonstrated the communication of a postoperative fluid collection with the biliary tree, consistent with biloma. 1 atypical hepatoblastoma showed uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA on hepatocyte phase imaging, similar to what has been described in adults with atypical hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusions: Gadoxetate disodium enhanced MRI is useful in the imaging evaluation of hepatoblastoma, particularly in defining the relationship of tumor to vascular and biliary anatomy and in characterizing post-treatment complications.

            "text": "Methods & Materials: Patients who have previously undergone ultrasound and/or MRI in the course of their clinical workup within the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) were identified using electronic medical records. Imaging reports were reviewed by a single author in order to identify relevant imaging findings (interesting anatomic variations, associated anomalies, etc.). Pertinent images from these imaging examinations were de-identified and saved to a secure hard drive. The medical record was accessed by a single researcher to obtain relevant information regarding the patients' clinical presentations. In cases of corrective surgery, pathology reports were reviewed, if available, for correlation with the imaging findings. Results: Cases of Mullerian duct anomalies were reviewed within the pediatric population. Clinical manifestations were correlated with imaging appearances. Conclusions: Mullerian duct anomalies represent a range of developmental variants. Although functioning ovaries and age-appropriate external genitalia are characteristic, there may be anomalies ranging from uterine and vaginal agenesis, to duplication of the uterus and vagina, to minor uterine cavity abnormalities. M\u00fcllerian malformations are frequently associated with abnormalities of the renal and axial skeletal systems, and pediatric patients in particular may present with these associated anomalies. Menstrual abnormalities may represent a more typical presentation in the adolescent age group. This is in contrast to the adult population, which may be more likely to present with infertility. The variation in clinical presentations make Mullerian duct anomalies difficult to diagnose and, because surgical techniques for correction and treatment depend on the underlying anatomy, understanding these variants in the context of imaging studies is important to their diagnosis and management. Patient 2 had radiographs which showed an irregular left humeral metaphysis with an associated fracture. Patient 3 had a 3 phase bone scan that showed slightly increased uptake on the angiographic and blood pool phases and increased activity on the delayed phase in the right femur. Radiographs showed a moth eaten appearance of the right femur with soft tissue swelling. Patient 4 had radiographs that showed periosteal reaction in the right tibia with an associated fracture. Patient 5, in addition to radiographs, had an MRI that showed osteomyelitis of the left humerus and scapula with an associated subperiosteal abscess. Patient 6 had multi focal osteomyelitis that was demonstrated on radiographs by irregular cortices and periosteal reaction involving the upper and lower extremities. Conclusions: Neonatal osteomyelitis is an uncommon entity that can have severe complications if not diagnosis and treated promptly. It is important to review cases and to review the appearance of neonatal osteomyelitis on multiple modalities. Radiographs will usually demonstrate periosteal reaction and possibly soft tissue swelling. Additional studies may be obtained to evaluate for complications, such as abscesses or involvement of the joint space. Purpose or Case Report: Review the epidemiology of DDH. Describe the critical diagnostic imaging findings of DDH. Understand the role of imaging accompanying treatment. Methods & Materials: Images including radiographs, ultrasound, CT and MRI will be used to demonstrate the current and historical role of imaging in caring for patients with DDH. Discussion of the importance of reducing radiation exposure when choosing imaging studies will be included. Results: Radiographs and ultrasound are used primarily in making the diagnosis of DDH. Ultrasound and MRI are most often used during the course of treatment to assess its effectiveness. MRI is increasingly utilized without sedation for patients in spica cast.

Advantages of ultrasound, a relatively non-invasive technique, include excellent spatial resolution, low cost, lack of ionizing radiation, lack of need for sedation, and the ability to image the patient in real-time. The major disadvantage of ultrasound is operator dependency, which is particularly evident in musculoskeletal applications.

Results: Multiple epiphyseal lesions were elucidated primarily by radiography, with cross-sectional imaging included where clinically necessary. Congenital lesions include the epiphyseal dysplasias represented here by chondrodysplasia punctata. Epiphyseal infarction may due to multiple etiologies including slipped capitol femoral epiphysis, developmental dysplasia of the hip, sickle cell disease, or idiopathic reasons. Neoplasms may occur in the epiphysis, including chondroblastoma and histiocytosis. Traumatic lesions include fracture and avulsion. Osteomyelitis can occur in the epiphysis as well. Pseudolesions that mimic pathology will also be reviewed. Other pathologies that can affect the epiphysis include juvenile idiopathic arthritis and hemophilia. Conclusions: A wide spectrum of congenital and acquired pathologies may affect the epiphysis in the infant and child. Plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging all contribute to the diagnosis of these varied lesions. Purpose or Case Report: We aim to present the spectrum of common and uncommon hip disorders in pediatric population. We will formulate a systematic approach and present a flowchart to workup and characterize hip diseases. Methods & Materials: Relevant imaging appearances of normal as well as pathological hip will be presented. Normal hip anatomy will be discussed through anatomic drawings and radiological images (plain radiographs, CT, USG, and MRI). We will illustrate the various anatomic landmarks, measurements and lines on plain radiographs and ultrasound of hip. Results: Evaluation of limp and hip pain in the pediatric population has undergone rapid evolution. Surgical treatment for these disorders continues to be refined, and our ability to identify patients along the spectrum of disease continues to improve. Yet, despite our advances, obtaining an accurate diagnosis can remain challenging, especially in the setting of mild structural abnormalities. Many imaging studies can be used to evaluate the bones and soft tissues, but conventional radiography is the primary imaging modality for most clinical conditions. Plain radiographs usually are obtained first because they are sensitive and specific for a wide range of bone pathology. More sophisticated imaging modalities including radionuclide scintigraphy (bone scan), ultrasonography (USG), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are reserved for specific clinical situations. Each of these imaging modalities has specific advantages and disadvantages. It is the aim of this review to guide in selecting and interpreting the appropriate imaging modality for a variety of common disorders. This exhibit will illustrate imaging features of developmental dysplasia of hip, Perthes disease, Slipped Capital femoral epiphyses, hip malformations in syndromes, femoral acetabural impingement, labral disorders, septic arthrits and other disorders. The role of various imaging modalities in evaluation of these disorders will be discussed, along with common imaging pearls and pitfalls. Conclusions: A systematic approach is necessary for evaluation of pediatric hip disorders. Familiarity with normal appearances, pitfalls and specific imaging of these entities is essential for proper diagnosis and management.",

Laurence, MD, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, nkang26@gmail.com; Monica Epelman, Richard Markowitz, Camilo Jaimes, Diego Jaramillo, Nancy Chauvin Purpose or Case Report: A common benign bone-forming lesion, osteoid osteoma comprises approximately 12% of all benign bone tumors. The tumor is composed of a nidus of vascular osteoid tissue and woven bone lined by osteoblasts, frequently with considerable surrounding inflammation. The radiolucent nidus surrounded by variable degrees of reactive sclerosis usually leads to a straightforward diagnosis; however, sometimes the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma can be challenging, as it may have a non-specific and misleading appearance on different imaging modalities, particularly on MRI. The purpose of this exhibit is to review the typical and atypical features of osteoid osteomas on different imaging modalities.

Results: When osteoid osteomas occur in atypical locations the diagnosis can be elusive. When located in the intraarticular space there is often minimal or absent cortical thickening and there may be a joint effusion with synovial hypertrophy. Phalangeal lesions may cause extensive bone marrow edema and surrounding soft tissue swelling. Both of these types of osteoid osteomas can be mistaken for infection. The recently described \"CT vessel\" or \"vascular groove\" sign, a low density vascular groove adjacent to the nidus, is highly specific for osteoid osteoma. In the authors' experience, a rim of sclerosis surrounding the nidus may aid in diagnosis on MRI and can be identified as an outer hypointense halo on all sequences. We illustrate the findings in cases of atypical osteoid osteomas which may be difficult to diagnose including intraarticular, phalangeal, and vertebral osteoid osteomas. We also show examples of the newly described sign which has high specificity for osteoid osteoma. Conclusions: Imaging findings in osteoid osteomas can be misleading and cause misdiagnosis, especially in atypical cases. Knowledge of their appearance in atypical locations and specific findings can aid in the correct diagnosis.",

Doria, MD, The Hospital for Sick Children-Diagnostic Imaging, andrea.doria@sickkids.ca; Frederico Xavier, Arun Mohanta, Carina Man, Ningning Zhang, Pamela Hilliard Purpose or Case Report: 1.To report a systematic ultrasound (US) protocol for assessment of hemophilic elbows. 2. To discuss advantages and disadvantages of US and MRI for evaluating hemophilic elbows in comparison with physical examination. 3.To illustrate US and MRI findings and associated pitfalls in hemophilic joints. Background: The value of physical examination for assessment of early arthropathic changes in hemophilic joints is unknown. US does not require sedation in young children, but involves operator training and standardized technique. MRI is the reference standard imaging modality for assessment of pathology in hemophilic joints. Standardization of a systematic protocol for data acquisition and interpretation of US findings and understanding of the correlation of findings between physical examination, US and MRI in hemophilic elbows is essential for the use US as an outcome measure both in clinical practice and research. So far such information is not available for growing elbow joints. Methods & Materials: Eight hemophilic boys (age range/ median, 7-17/13 years) with a history of prior elbow bleeds underwent US and MR imaging, and physical examination on the same day. Corresponding images on US and MRI were highlighted to illustrate abnormalities and pitfalls. Soft tissues (effusion/hemarthrosis,synovial hypertrophy,hemosiderin deposition) changes were characterized as small, moderate, or large. Erosions, cartilage and subchondral abnormalities were graded based on depth or extent of articular changes. Results: 1. US is helpful for discriminating synovial hypertrophy, joint effusion/hemarthrosis, and large hemosiderin deposition which otherwise generates susceptibility artifacts on gradient-echo MRI obscuring adjacent tissues. 2. US can visualize erosions, cartilage and subchondral abnormalities at the joint periphery. However,differentiation between subchondral cysts and erosions is usually unfeasible by US. 3. Prior knowledge of the degree of joint maturation is essential for an accurate evaluation of cartilage loss by US. 4. Physical examination has limitations for assessment of early joint changes in contrast to US. Conclusions: US can be useful for assessing hemophilic elbows, with advantages over MRI in the evaluation of soft tissues. Further development of an US-MRI atlas on normal cartilage in growing joints is needed for definition of the value of US in the assessment of minimal osteochondral abnormalities.",

Developing expertise in the radiographic evaluation of skeletal dysplasias can be difficult, as more than 250 dysplasias exist. Exhaustive description of individual dysplasias can be found in hard copy textbooks, without the ability to compare individual dysplasias side by side. By providing radiographic images and descriptive text of thirteen common skeletal dysplasias and two comparative normal skeletal surveys, we aim to facilitate understanding of the terminology and highlight the differences in imaging appearances one may commonly encounter in interpreting skeletal dysplasias. Methods & Materials: Initial skeletal surveys and/or follow up radiographs obtained for evaluation of skeletal dysplasias at our institution from 2005 to 2011 were compiled and reviewed for best quality images. Selected images for each case were labeled according to body part and view, to include AP and lateral views of the spine and skull and AP views of the extremities and pelvis. For neonates, AP and lateral babygram images were used. The software program used for viewing the atlas, written in C#, may be freely downloaded. It permits linked scrolling and resizing of the images, and simultaneous comparison of different cases is available. Cases may be viewed as unknowns or in a selfteaching mode. Results: Radiographic images for thirteen common skeletal dysplasias and two comparative normal skeletons (neonate and child) are provided within an interactive digital atlas. Cases include achondroplasia, pseudoachondroplasia, cleidocranial dysplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, diaphyseal dysplasia, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, osteopetrosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, multiple hereditary exostoses, dysostosis multiplex, fibrous dysplasia, asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (Jeune syndrome), and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. Conclusions: By displaying radiographic images of several common skeletal dysplasias in an interactive and comparative format with descriptive text, understanding of basic radiographic terminology and appearances will be facilitated. Purpose or Case Report: 1. To classify various pediatric MSK soft tissue masses 2. To describe pathogenesis, imaging appearances and differential diagnosis of these lesions Methods & Materials: Radiology and clinical medical records were reviewed and pediatric patients with musculoskeletal soft tissue masses were identified. Representative images were collected as examples of each lesion. The lesions were then classified into different groups based on the similar pathology and etiology. Brief discussion is done for each of these masses with their multimodality imaging appearances. Results: The search yielded pediatric soft tissue masses of multiple different etiologies, including post-traumatic (hematoma, fat necrosis, fibromatosis coli, myositis ossificans), inflammatory or infectious (cellulitis, abscess, granuloma annulare, retained foreign bodies), pseudotumors (synovial cysts, ganglion cysts, vascular malformations) and neoplastic lesions (fatty, vascular, neural, fibrous, muscular). Multiple different imaging modalities were used to evaluate these masses, including ultrasound, CT and MRI. Representative examples of different lesions and their appearances on different imaging modalities will be presented and an organized approach to the diagnosis of these lesions will be discussed. Conclusions: Musculoskeletal soft tissue masses are relatively common in children. Majority of these are benign; however, up to 6% of these lesions can be malignant \"sarcomas\". Multiple different imaging modalities often provide complimentary information in the work-up of these lesions. Despite multimodality imaging approach, tissue diagnosis or short interval follow-up is still often required when the mass does not show typical features of a benign etiology. Pediatric radiologists should be familiar with various pediatric MSK soft tissue masses and their imaging appearances, and should be able to guide appropriate management. Results: 199 elbow MRI examinations were reviewed on children aged 4 months to 18 years with 28 (14%) of these investigating clinical instability in 25 children. Mechanism of injuries included congenital dislocation 10 (36%), traumatic dislocation 13 (46%), fracture or avulsion 2 (7%) and other injuries 3 (11%). The patient's with congenital elbow dislocations most commonly presented with radial head dislocation and associated dysplasia or flattening, effusion and less frequently dysplasia of the olecranon or capitellum. Patient's with traumatic dislocations were frequently associated with ligamentous or capsular disruption, bone oedema and epicondylar avulsion with effusion, loose osseous bodies and fractures less often. The epicondylar avulsions and ligamentous or tendon injuries occurred equally often in those few patients with unspecified injury mechanism. Conclusions: A number of the bony, ligamentous, articular and developmental anomalies evident on elbow MRI have been illustrated highlighting the importance of careful and systematic review of all elbow structures when presented with a child with elbow instability. Accurate identification of these abnormalities is vital to facilitate their appropriate management. Methods & Materials: From our computerized radiology information system, we retrieved all patients that have foot ultrasound for evaluation of vertical or oblique talus deformities in the last 6 years (10/2005-10/2011). The US was performed by a pediatric radiologist using a high resolution linear and tight convex curve probes with foot in neutral, plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. All medical charts, ultrasound scans and foot radiographs were reviewed by a pediatric radiologist. Results: We identified nine patients' with foot deformities who were suspected of vertical or oblique talus and were evaluated by ultrasound. Seven patients are male; two of them had initial foot radiographs that were not diagnostic. Two female patients had unilateral oblique talus deformity.

However, pediatric musculoskeletal imagers are increasingly leveraging newer techniques to add specificity to their diagnoses when abnormal marrow signal is detected. The purpose of this educational exhibit is to review the application of current MR techniques to pediatric marrow imaging across the spectrum of normal, variant, and pathologic processes. Methods & Materials: Cases with potentially overlapping imaging appearances on conventional MR sequences, including hematopoetic marrow, sickle cell disease, osteomyelitis, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, and infiltrative neoplasms, will be presented. The basis of various MR techniques including chemical shift imaging, \"whole body\" marrow imaging, diffusion weighted imaging, and fat-water separation techniques such as Dixon or IDEAL (GE) will be reviewed. The strengths and weaknesses of such techniques in differentiating between infection, neoplasm, and normal variation will be emphasized through the case examples. Challenges and pitfalls in the imaging of these pathologies using such techniques will be discussed. Results: Current MR imaging techniques add specificity to diagnoses of marrow pathology which are otherwise difficult to differentiate using traditional sequences alone. The use of opposed phase imaging can be helpful in differentiate hematopoietic marrow or infection from infiltrative and neoplastic conditions. \"Whole body\" marrow imaging may serve as an alternative to other modalities which involve significant radiation exposure. The use of diffusion weighted imaging is a promising, but developing, technique being applied to marrow pathology. Conclusions: Pediatric bone marrow MR imaging is a challenging area for a vast majority of the radiologists. Understanding normal developmental bone marrow changes and being aware of the pitfalls is crucial to render accurate diagnosis. Current techniques such as IDEAL, chemical shift imaging, and \"whole body\" MRI have a potentially important role in further characterization of marrow abnormalities.",

Jackson, Tanya Hinds, Katherine Deye Purpose or Case Report: To present less common imaging manifestations of injuries in child abuse that may not be readily recognized as possibly abusive injury. Methods & Materials: Through bi-monthly review of cases with the child protection team over a period of 12 years, the imaging studies of patients with suspected non-accidental trauma were recorded. Of the 654 pts with suspected nonaccidental trauma, outcomes were available in 599 patients. The child protection team concluded 254 (43%) were cases of non-accidental trauma with reasonable medical certainty. This data base was reviewed for less common injuries that were found in these medically confirmed cases of child abuse. Results: Less common manifestations of abuse identified by radiographs included Salter-Harris injuries in the proximal humerus, and proximal femur. Pelvic fractures were rare and when present were associated with sexual abuse. Severe chest wall injury, with associated rib fractures, causing complete or near-complete white-out of the chest was occasionally encountered. Soft tissue injures, such as hematomas were found in various locations in the body including the buttocks and anterior abdominal wall, were imaged on ultrasound and CT. Paraor prevertebral injuries, with or without associated bone injury were identified; one infant presented with retropharyngeal soft tissue swelling. MRI identified cervical spine injuries which included ligamentous injury and intrathecal hematomas. Conclusions: While classic metaphyseal lesions and rib fractures are the most common, specific injuries documented by radiologic work up of suspected non-accidental trauma, less common injuries to the soft tissue and skeletal system may occur as a result of child abuse.

Using a data search program from a large academic institution, pediatric ankle ultrasounds performed in the last 10 years were reviewed. Pathologies include trauma, inflammation/infection, masses and congenital abnormalities. Examples of normal anatomy will be included particularly when demonstrating ligament and tendon pathology. The normal side was often assessed for comparison purposes. Results: Ankle sonography is a useful modality to evaluate commonly encountered pathologies in the pediatric ankle. Radiographically occult fractures may be discovered. Ligament and tendon pathology, such as tears of the anterior talofibular ligament, high ankle sprain and peroneus longus tendon tears, can be easily detected. Signs of infection that can be radiographically occult such as subtle periosteal reaction or fluid collections can be identified. Finally, \"lumps and bumps\" can be characterized. For example, one of the most commonly encountered masses in the pediatric ankle is a ganglion cyst which can be well characterized sonographically. Awareness of imaging pitfalls is also critical to avoid misdiagnosis and to guide appropriate management. Conclusions: With basic ultrasound skills and knowledge of normal anatomy, sonography of the pediatric ankle is a useful modality to evaluate soft tissue structures and other pathologies. It is comparable to MRI and allows for dynamic evaluation without need for anesthesia. Resonance Angiography (MRA) using time resolved imaging is a relatively new technique that has become increasingly utilized in the diagnosis of vascular anomalies. We will describe the technique used at our institution, Time Resolved Imaging of Contrast Kinetics (TRICKS, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), and the parameters that can be adjusted to optimize the exam. We will review key imaging features of hemangiomas and vascular malformations in various modalities, with a special emphasis on the TRICKS appearance.",

            "text": "We performed a retrospective review of all the TRICKS studies performed at our institution for suspected vascular anomalies. In addition to the MR imaging features, we specifically analyzed the T1 weighted with fat saturation post TRICKS enhancement and the temporal TRICKS enhancement pattern. We reviewed all additional imaging including plain film, ultrasound, and CT and correlated the radiographic imaging with the available clinical and histopathologic features. Results: We present illustrative cases of hemangiomas, kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, venous malformations, arteriovenous malformations, lymphatic malformations, and other pitfall lesions. We propose a diagnostic algorithm that relies heavily on the post contrast T1 weighted with fat saturation post TRICKS enhancement pattern and the temporal TRICKS enhancement pattern. Conclusions: Time resolved contrast-enhanced MRA has become an increasingly important adjunct in the diagnosis of vascular anomalies. Optimization of the exam technique and familiarity of the TRICKS imaging appearance is essential and can often assist in accurate lesion characterization. Purpose or Case Report: Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR) is increasingly used in the treatment of thoracic insufficiency, scoliosis, and chest wall defects in children. In contrast to spinal fusion surgery, VEPTR allows for growth while stabilizing the deformity. We review the indications, pre-operative imaging, normal radiographic appearance, and complications of this device. Methods & Materials: On review of the literature, the indications for VEPTR have expanded in the past several years to include thoracic insufficiency, idiopathic and neuromuscular scoliosis, and chest wall defects. We illustrate the normal radiographic appearance of the three common configurations of VEPTR (cradle-to-cradle assembly, cradle with lumbar extension assembly; cradle-to-ala hook assembly). We discuss the potential complications of VEPTR, including infection, rib fracture, dislodged hardware, and neurological injury, with an emphasis on imaging diagnosis. Results: There is a relatively high rate of reported complications with VEPTR in the literature. Therefore, awareness of the growing number of indications, as well as the expected and unexpected appearance of this device, aids in radiographic diagnosis of complications. Conclusions: Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR) is gaining acceptance in the treatment of thoracic insufficiency, scoliosis, and chest wall defects in children. Recognition of the indications, normal radiographic appearance, and complications of this device will facilitate timely and accurate diagnosis. Disclosure: Dr. Philips has indicated that she will discuss or describe, in the educational content, a use of a medical device or pharmaceutical that is classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as investigational for intended use.",

The most common differentials include pilocytic astrocytoma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. MR imaging is crucial to diagnosis, staging and identification of complications such as hydrocephalus and haemorrhage. Soft tissue characteristics alongside tumour location, invasion and clinical history facilitate radiological discrimination prior to surgery. However, there is significant clinical equipoise with regards to the imaging appearances in a significant proportion of cases making definite diagnosis difficult. The aim of this study is to evaluate the radiological findings and correlate with histological data. This will allow identification of the key morphological features that discriminate different tumours. These can then be presented to educate fellow radiologists. Methods & Materials: Radiology PACS and patient notes were used to collate radiological, histological and clinical data. Results: There were 27 patients presenting at our institution with posterior fossa tumours. 12 had pilocytic astrocytomas, 8 had medulloblastomas and 7 had ependymomas. One patient had an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumour (ATRT). Traditional features alongside more advanced MR characteristics were correlated with histology, and the features allowing for discrimination of tumour types are presented in this pictorial review. Conclusions: Posterior fossa tumours have a highly variable radiological appearance. We present a range of appearances and describe the important morphological features that allow radiological discrimination of tumour type.",

Tuna, MD, Radiology, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, dristuna@yahoo.com; Teresa C. Gross Kelly, Tushar Chandra, Mohit Maheshwari, Sumit Singh, Hervey D. Segall Purpose or Case Report: Radiological evaluation of the pediatric spine can be more challenging in child than in the adult patient due to the wide range of normal anatomic variants and synchondroses, combined with the unique effects of trauma in children. MRI is an excellent imaging modality for the evaluation of the pediatric spine. However, in order to provide an accurate interpretation of acute posttraumatic changes in the pediatric spine, particularly in the setting of abusive head trauma, a fundamental knowledge of normal anatomy, variants and pathology of the pediatric spine is required. The aim of this educational exhibit is to illustrate normal MRI anatomy of the spine in the infant, child and adolescent. Methods & Materials: This exhibit will first describe basic spinal embryology and development of the vertebra and spinal cord, followed by MRI depiction of the developmental anatomy of the spine from infancy through adolescence. The changing appearance of the spinal canal, spinal cord and vertebral bodies with age will be illustrated using normal cases from the radiology database. Sagittal and transverse diameter of vertebral bodies, thickness of the dural thecal sac, dimensions of the spinal canal, normal bone marrow signal changes, vertebral body heights, level of conus medullaris, prevertebral and paraspinous soft tissues and epidural fat thickness will be described and changes according to age will be pointed out.",

            "text": "Results: In early life, the spinal cord extends to the inferior aspect of the bony spinal column. Because the vertebral bodies grow longitudinally faster than the spinal cord does, the conus medullaris may change. Ossification of the vertebral bodies and posterior elements is nearly complete by age 10, with a resultant decrease in the spinal canal diameter. The nucleus pulposus becomes smaller after 10 years and spans approximately half the disk space in the sagittal plane. The spinal cord is elliptical in cross section in the cervical spine and demonstrates a difference in signal between the normal gray and white matter of the spinal cord which should not be mistaken for intramedullary pathology. Conclusions: A solid understanding of normal spine anatomy and embryological development is essential in evaluation of pediatric spine, mainly in the setting of trauma. Familiarity with normal anatomic variants is essential to provide an accurate interpretation of pathology in the pediatric spine.",

Methods & Materials: A retrospective review of our imaging database was performed to identify studies obtained in which the findings included intracranial cystic lesions. Results: Multiple cystic lesions were elucidated primarily by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. These lesions can be divided into nonneoplastic and nonneoplastic tumor-associated cysts. The nonneoplastic cysts, which is the largest group, include: cavum septi pellucidi and cavum veli interpositi, choroid plexus cyst, enlarged peri-vascular spaces, pineal cyst, the large spectrum of arachnoid cysts, colloid cyst, epidermoid cyst, Rathke cleft cyst, and porencephalic cyst. Nonneoplastic tumor-associated cysts include: craniopharyngioma, optic glioma, pilocytic astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma, and ganglioglioma. Conclusions: Intracranial cystic lesions are relatively common entities in the pediatric population. A wide spectrum of nonneoplastic and nonneoplastic tumor associated pathologies are presented using both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Kelly, Sumit Singh, Ibrahim S. Tuna, Hervey D. Segall Purpose or Case Report: The aim of this educational exhibit is to provide a comprehensive review of imaging features, classification and management of pediatric spinal cord tumors. We also aim to elicit the differences between pediatric spinal cord tumors and their adult counterparts. We will summarize the differences between the individual tumors based on histological cell types and the pertinent implications on management and outcome Methods & Materials: This exhibit will provide an overview of the common as well as uncommon tumors of the pediatric spinal cord. Various classification systems for these tumors-anatomical as well as histological will be discussed. We will illustrate the relevant imaging findings that can help in differentiating these tumors. Results: Pediatric spinal cord tumors account for 1% to 10% of all pediatric central nervous system tumors. MRI is the mainstay for the initial diagnosis as well as the post surgical evaluation and surveillance of these tumors. Pediatric and adult spinal cord tumours differ both in terms of anatomical location as well as histology. The disease and treatment related morbidities are also different in children as compared to adults. Astrocytomas, ependymomas, glioneural tumors and CSF metastasis represent the vast majority of cord neoplasms in the pediatric age group. Some of cord tumors may also be associated with inherited syndromes (like Neurofibromatosis type 2) or may have genetic predisposition. These would also be discussed. We will also illustrate and discuss common non neoplastic spinal masses that may mimic tumors. Conclusions: Pediatric spinal cord tumors have varied clinical presentations, imaging appearance and outcome.

Using cases that have been imaged with multiple modalities, the exhibit will delineate the sonographic, MR, and CT appearance of congenital, infectious, and neoplastic head and neck lesions in the pediatric population. Methods & Materials: A restrospective search of PACS was performed on studies completed at the Oklahoma University Medical Center on the Oklahoma University Health Science Center Campus from January 2008 to the present. Ultrasound, CT, and MR examinations were selected that depicted relevant pediatric head and neck pathology. All studies were de-identified prior to image export. Results: Over twenty representative cases of pediatric infections, fibrous tumors, cystic neoplasms, vascular malformation, bony tumors, developmental anomalies, and other neoplasms were selected for inclusion. Results: Pictorial review of cases including the following representative cases: myelonmeningocele associated with Arnold Chiari malformation, lipomyelomeningocele, tethered cord with spinal lipoma/fibrofatty filum, tethered cord and dermal sinus tract, and Chiari I with syringohydromyelia. Several unique cases including the following will be presented as well: thoracic meningocele with Arnold Chiari malformation, terminal myelocystocele, diastematomyelia, and myelomeningocele without Arnold Chiari malformation. While MRI demonstrates the cranio-cervical junction and the cervicothoracic spinal cord better than ultrasound, ultrasound often allows for improved resolution of the distal spinal cord, lumbosacral spinal canal, and spinal dysraphism structures near the skin surface in the neonate. Conclusions: Congenital spinal malformations are complex and variable in imaging appearance. It is important to understand the classification in order to determine the appropriate management and prognosis. In the neonatal period imaging should be performed with ultrasound and MRI studies, as they may provide different and complementary information. Conclusions: Hypoxic Ischemic Injury is a common condition resulting in a wide spectrum of severe neurological defects. While in the past treatment only consisted of supportive care for HII, recent advances have yielded promising treatment options if initiated within a limited time window. Thus due to the severity of the disease and the need for rapid intervention, it is important to recognize radiological manifestations of HII along with its clinical signs and symptoms to offer a better prognosis to the patient.",

            "text": "Results: Some of the forms of craniosynostosis may have a genetic basis, but many are spontaneous in nature. Untreated progressive craniosynostosis can lead to inhibition of brain growth, and an increase in intracranial pressure. MDCT with MIP and 3D surface reformations is the preferred modality for diagnostic evaluation of craniosynostosis. It is also a robust modality for post operative assessment and long-term follow up. MRI is a useful adjunct for assessment of associated intracranial anomalies and complications. Timely and appropriate imaging is essential to assess for potential complications of craniosynostosis which may include intracranial hypertension, anomalies of external and middle ear, hydrocephalus, chronic tonsillar herniation, cranial base deformity, impaired venous drainage, enlarged emissary foramina and veins and optic atrophy. On the other hand, positional plagiocephaly should not be misinterpreted as craniosynostosis. Surgical management is typical for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, which involves correction of craniosynostosis between three to six months of age. Conservative management is the mainstay for syndromic craniosynostosis. Postoperative follow up imaging for surveillance for ventricular size and signs of raised intracranial pressure are necessary. Conclusions: Craniosynostosis is a challenging area of pediatric neuroimaging. Knowledge of the sutural anatomy, an understanding of the potential intracranial complications caused by premature sutural closure, as well as the role that imaging plays in presurgical planning, can provide a practical way for the radiologist to evaluate craniosynostosis in a fast-paced clinical setting.",

It is not easy always to differentiate between different tumors. Important imaging characteristics will help us towards better differential diagnosis. In this exhibit, we will illustrate ultrasound anatomy of the neonatal spinal cord. Discussion of the normal anatomic variants and pathological conditions of the spinal cord will be provided. Representative images of a variety of common and uncommon pathological conditions of the spine will be presented to illustrate teaching points. In abnormal cases, follow up MRI images will also be illustrated for comparison. Results: Ultrasound is a robust screening modality for evaluation of the lumbosacral spine in neonates. It is cheaper, readily available, safer first line imaging modality in neonates suspected to have spinal malformations. Under able and well trained operator, diagnostic accuracy of spinal ultrasound approaches MRI. However, MRI remains the gold standard for imaging evaluation of spine. Normal variants that simulate disease processes like ventriculus terminalis, prominent filum terminale and central echo complex will be presented. Congenital malformations of the cord such as tethered cord, hydromyelia, lipoma, diastematomyelia, myelomeningocele, lateral meningocele and presacral masses will also be discussed. Conclusions: Ultrasound is a very useful screening technique for evaluation of pathological conditions of lumbosacral spine in neonates. This review would improve the understanding of utility and limitations of ultrasound in evaluation of neonatal spinal malformations. Purpose or Case Report: Although MRI is the standard for detecting epilepsy and brain tumor abnormalities, PET-CT is performed to ascertain metabolism related to epileptogenic regions or characterize tumor metabolic activity. Asymmetric metabolism often correlates to structural abnormalities like cortical dysplasia. Metabolic activity often correlates with tumor aggressiveness or grade. FDG PET is commonly used to assess seizure and tumor metabolism. The lesser utilized amino acid PET tracers (C11 Methionine, FDOPA) show increasing value with lower grade tumors due to high tumor to normal tissue contrast. Literature is accumulating regarding C11 methionine (CMET) in the detection of lesions like cortical dysplasia and its ability to delineate low grade seizure related tumor lesions. Despite the established FDG and accumulating CMET literature, little information exists about the imaging seen with both in pediatrics. As these studies are increasingly viewed as part of fusion MRI images, there is more scrutiny of focal metabolism correlating with MRI findings and less interpretative reliance on abnormality based solely on asymmetry.",

Studies demonstrating a variety of tumors, postoperative findings of residual or recurrent tumor, and pseudoprogression were selected. Epilepsy cases with structural cortical abnormalities or seizure-associated tumors were also selected. CMET and FDG studies were analyzed by 3 pediatric neuroradiologists and the imaging findings correlated with prior MRI and any pathology or follow-up imaging. Pictorial galleries of the CMET and FDG imaging patterns were created. Results: Pathologically proven low-grade glial tumors showed increased CMET uptake and no hypermetabolism on FDG. High-grade tumors showed increased uptake on CMET and hypermetabolism on FDG. Patients with residual or recurrent tumors showed uptake similar to their original tumor. Granulation tissue and pseudoprogression changes showed increased uptake on CMET and no hypermetabolism on FDG. Epilepsy surgery patients with cortical dysplasia or low grade glial tumors showed increased uptake on CMET and FDG hypometabolism. Conclusions: This study illustrates the variety of findings on CMET and FDG PET-CT in pediatric patients clinically evaluated for brain tumor and epilepsy.

Glade, Anthony Alleman Purpose or Case Report: The clinical spectrum of sinusitis in children can range from uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis to invasive fungal sinusitis. Most cases respond favorably to medical management. However, complications occasionally occur due to the spread to adjacent structures. Imaging plays an important role in characterizing the disease and guiding the clinical and surgical planning and treatment. This electronic presentation outlines the following-1. Review radiologic anatomy and unique characteristics of pediatric sinuses. 2. Review the clinical features, pathophysiology, and microbiology of sinusitis. 3. Review of CT and MRI imaging characteristics of sinusitis with representative cases such as complicated sinusitis and invasive fungal sinusitis. 4. Review the treatment approaches of sinusitis. Methods & Materials: A retrospective search of PACS was performed on studies completed at the OU Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City for the last three years. CT and MR examinations were selected that depicted relevant disease processes. Corresponding nasal endoscopic pictures were obtained from cases which required surgical management. All studies were de-identified prior to image export. Results: Over fifteen representative cases of the clinical spectrum of sinusitis and its complications were selected for inclusion. Conclusions: This educational exhibit provides a concise review of imaging, clinical features, and treatment of pediatric sinusitis. Findings will be richly illustrated with radiological and clinical images. microcephaly or hydrocephalus. Knowing the embryology of the cerebellum and 4th ventricle is important to perceive the development of posterior fossa malformations and to further understand the imaging findings. Several classifications schemes have been proposed from a pure embryologic to an imaging-based approach using some essential findings such as the size of the posterior fossa, the presence of CSF collection or expansion of CSF space, and the size and morphology of the cerebellum. MR is the gold-standard for adequately access and characterize the posterior fossa structures. This pictorial essay will review the MR findings of some of the most common posterior fossa malformations including Dandy-Walker malformation, persistent Blakes pouch, mega cisterna magna, arachnoid cyst, paleocerebellar hypoplasia, cerebellar agenesis, cerebellar and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, cerebelar cortical malformations, isolated brainstem hypoplasia/dysplasia and Chiari malformations.

While there was considerable overlap in imaging appearances, making a precise diagnosis was found to be challenging in difficult cases, and by and large, a stepwise approach was successfully formulated and used to: 1. Diagnose the more emergent conditions and to 2. Devise a management algorithm for the less acute abnormalities.

We will also briefly discuss the embryology, genetic basis, classification schemes and characteristic imaging findings . Methods & Materials: This exhibit will illustrate three main categories of cortical malformations: neuronal proliferation, migration and organization. Understanding of this complex topic would be facilitated by brief discussion on the embryological basis and proposed genetic causes of some of these cortical malformations. Classification schemes on embryology and imaging will be discussed. Characteristic imaging findings of these malformations will be discussed and examples from the authors database will be shown. Results: Neuroimaging in pediatric seizures is challenging. MRI is considered the imaging modality of choice because of superior soft tissue contrast and better ability to characterize the pathologic process. We will also discuss the dedicated seizure protocol which is used in our institute. PET-CT imaging can also provides additional information in cases where MRI is negative, inconclusive or does not correlate with EEG/clinical findings. Brief discussion on advanced imaging techniques will also be presented. Malformations are frequently detected in infancy. However, if the initial MRI scan performed in infancy is negative, a repeat scan after 2 years of age may be helpful. Conclusions: Evaluation of cortical malformation in seizure patients still remains a challenging area of pediatric neuroimaging. Reviewing of the embryological basis, classification schemes and characteristic imaging findings would improve the understanding the cortical malformations and interpreting the images.",

Results: A brief overview of neonatal cystic spine lesions, their etiology, and imaging appearance is presented in poster format utilizing both literature search and printed reference material. Images from several cases of cystic neonatal spine lesions are presented. Conclusions: Neonatal spine ultrasound is often performed to evaluate for abnormalities related to the presence of sacral dimples, cutaneous stigmata, skin tags, hairy tufts, during the evaluation of other congenital anomalies, or when prenatal ultrasound/MRI demonstrates an abnormality warranting postnatal follow-up. The identification of cystic spinal cord lesions is relatively rare in the neonate. However, the etiology of these lesions can often be deduced or surmised based upon the location and the imaging appearance of the lesion. The most common cause of a cystic intramedullary spinal lesion is ventriculus terminalis, with a reported incidence of 2.6%. Additional lesions include transient dilatation of the central canal, filar cyst, syringohydromyelia, intramedullary arachnoid cyst, and myelomalacia related to in utero/birth trauma. Extremely rare etiologies in the neonate include epidermoid/dermoid, cavernous malformation, intranatal cystic infections etiologies, neuroepithelial cysts, and cystic neoplasms. Mimics include diastematamyelia, spinal lipomas, and intramedullary hematomas. Numerous imaging examples of these lesions are provided in the accompanying poster.",

Soares, MD, Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California at San Francisco, bruno.soares@ucsf. edu; Leonardo Vedolin, Guido Gonzalez Purpose or Case Report: Our presentation aims to illustrate the brain MRI patterns in peroxisomal disorders. Peroxisomes are intracellular organelles involved in important cellular processes including beta-oxidation of very-longchain fatty acids and plasmalogen production. Peroxisomal disorders can be categorized into disorders of peroxisomal biogenesis, in which the peroxisomes are abnormally formed and several peroxisomal functions are deficient, and in defects involving a single peroxisomal function, in which the structure of the peroxisome is intact. Disorders of peroxisomal biogenesis include Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata. Numerous disorders are caused by loss of a single peroxisomal function including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and Acyl-coA oxidase deficiency. Clinical findings in peroxisomal disorders include dysmorphic features, hepatic dysfunction, neurodevelopmental delay, retinopathy and hearing impairment. Methods & Materials: Pictorial essay illustrating brain MRI patterns in peroxisomal disorders, including disorders of peroxisomal biogenesis and disorders with loss of a single peroxisomal function. Results: Brain abnormalities in peroxisomal disorders have a wide spectrum of patterns. Neuronal migration disorders with abnormal myelination are typically seen in Zellweger disease and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy. Specifically, the association of abnormal myelination with germinolytic cysts is suggestive of Zellweger syndrome. Classic X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy typically shows posterior central white matter involvement and symmetric demyelination also involving the corticospinal tracts and corpus callosum. A similar pattern of white matter involvement is seen in Acyl-coA oxidase deficiency and infantile Refsum disease. Conclusions: Brain MRI helps narrow the differential diagnosis and guides subsequent evaluation in infants presenting with clinical features concerning for peroxisomal disorders. Therefore, knowledge of the brain MRI patterns in peroxisomal disorders is important for the radiologist interpreting neuroimaging studies.",

The etiologies of cerebral venous thrombosis related infarction would be discussed from an imaging perspective with a case-based approach with emphasis on MRV and SWI techniques. Finally, we will focus on hemorrhagic causes of childhood stroke such as vascular malformation, aneurysm, neurocutaneous disorders, coagulopathy, and a variety of other causes from an imaging standpoint. Perfusion imaging in pediatric stroke demonstrates flow within the brain and can detect areas that are at risk of ischemia; however, further studies in the pediatric population need to be validated for the role of this technique in pediatric stroke. Results: The most important factors in the diagnosis of childhood stroke are causal investigation, appropriate laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Imaging is frequently the first step in the evaluation of an acutely ill child. Conclusions: Pediatric stroke is a debilitating disease that requires urgent multidisciplinary approach for diagnosis and treatment. In cases of both ischemic and hemorrhagic origin, the radiological approach to be obtained in emergency setting leads to the initial screening and the first therapeutic possibility. Methods & Materials: This exhibit will illustrate the characteristic imaging findings of vascular anomalies in the head and neck region. Vascular anomalies are divided into vascular tumors and vascular malformations which include slow flow malformations (capillary malformations, venous malformations, lymphatic malformations and their combinations) and high flow malformations (arteriovenous fistula and arteriovenous malformations). Complex malformations are also seen in several syndromes including Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome, PHACE syndrome, etc. Cases from author's database will be used for illustration. Results: A review of clinical manifestations, characteristic imaging findings and interventional treatment strategies in cases of head and neck vascular anomalies will be presented with pre and post treatment imaging features. Ultrasonography and MRI are the mainstay in diagnosis of these malformations. CT scan and catheter angiography may occasionally be needed for diagnosis and treatment planning.

The radiologist should be aware of this as use of DWI continues to grow. This exhibit with familiarize the reader with common conditions that specifically affect the cortex and produces true restricted diffusion. Methods & Materials: High resolution CT scan and MRI are mainstay of diagnosis and assessment in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. In this exhibit we will present a pictorial review of CT scan and MRI images of various causes of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that are seen on imaging. Reviewing the embryologic basis of these anomalies would enable better understanding of this complex subject. Results: The new system classifies these malformations according to descending order of severity into complete labyrinthine aplasia, cochlear aplasia, common cavity, cystic cochleovestibular malformation or incomplete partition-I (IP-I), cochleovestibular hypoplasia, and incomplete partition-II (IP-II). There is a lot of confusion in literature pertaining to Mondini deformity. The new classification divides incomplete partition into IP-I representing cystic cochleovestibular malformation and IP-II representing the classic Mondini deformity with three components (cystic cochlear apex, dilated vestibule, and large vestibular aqeduct). Recently a subclassification of IP-I and IP-II has been proposed (subdividing into typical and atypical subtypes)[2]. This will be discussed briefly. Isolated large vestibular aqueduct without associated cochlear abnormalities will also be discussed. We will discuss the relevant embryology with correlations of malformations to the timing of embryologic insult. Conclusions: The new classification system provides precision in description of inner ear malformation. This also helps in providing a uniform scale for comparison of effectiveness of cochlear implant for different malformations. Purpose or Case Report: Congenital cranial nerve anomalies often present as sensory and/or motor deficits of unknown etiology in the pediatric age group. The early recognition of a definitive cranial nerve abnormality using high-resolution imaging can focus further clinical investigation and shorten the time to diagnosis. Methods & Materials: To promote appropriate recognition of cranial nerve anomalies, we present the imaging findings of the most commonly affected cranial nerves and provide correlation with clinical presentation. All studies were performed on a 1.5 T magnet with dedicated high resolution imaging of cranial nerve exit zones. Results: Ours is a tertiary care pediatric hospital with an extensive neuroimaging database. We intend to review all known cases of cranial nerve anomalies from the prior 5 years and present interesting and representative images including optic nerve hypoplasia as part of septo-optic dysplasia, Kallman syndrome, Duane retraction syndrome, and Mobius syndrome. Conclusions: Congenital cranial nerve anomalies present with varied symptomatology including anosmia, impaired vision, occulomotor deficits, and hearing loss. Additionally, clinical manifestations of cranial nerve anomalies can be difficult to recognize in the pediatric age group. Effective imaging and prompt diagnosis is crucial to initiate appropriate clinical management. Purpose or Case Report: MR is the standard for evaluation of tumors or epilepsy. PET-CT imaging is often performed to ascertain metabolic asymmetries related to epileptogenic regions or to better characterize the metabolic activity of tumors. A baseline for normals with PET-CT FDG-18 and C11 Methionine does not exist. Methods & Materials: Retrospective review was performed of the 110 pediatric patients who underwent PET-CT with C11 Methionine and FDG. Representative studies were selected for patients imaged during infancy (<1 yr), early childhood (1-4), childhood (4-7), late childhood (7-12), teenage (13-18). C11 methionine and FDG studies were analyzed for normal patterns of uptake and any trends identified across the stratified age groups. Representative pictorial image galleries of the C11 methionine and FDG imaging patterns through development were created. Results: The pattern of radiotracer uptake on C11 methionine differed from that of FDG. The C11 uptake remained low level throughout development compared to FDG uptake, which was robust in much of the cortex. The cortical FDG uptake within the frontal lobes progressively increased with age. The C11 uptake within the brainstem and thalamus was equal to cortex throughout development. The FDG uptake within the basal ganglia was equal to cortex while the brainstem and thalamic uptake was generally less than cortex. Several anatomic structures showed robust C11 uptake not seen on FDG. These included the lacrimal, submandibular and parotid glands. Incidentally, the pituitary gland and hippocampus consistently showed C11 uptake equal to cortex contrary to their appearance on FDG. Our institutional protocol regarding the performance of combination C11 methionine and FDG brain PET-CT studies is presented. Conclusions: This study illustrated the normal appearance of brain PET-CT imaging performed with C11 methionine and FDG in a representative cohort of the pediatric patients through development. Normal variance imaging patterns and developmental trends seen with each radiotracer was demonstrated.",

Finally DTI tractography images will be used to delineate functional pathways to and from, as well as within, the cerebellum. Pathological specimens will be photographed to further illustrate gross anatomy. Results: Afferent white matter pathways travel mainly via the inferior and middle cerebellar peduncles. The main efferent cerebellar white matter pathway is through the superior cerebellar peduncle. Transverse fiber tracts are present in the vermis. There are mainly two main systems of cerebellar white matter fibers which are easily visualized with DTI color mapping; however more anterior components of DTI tracts are intermixed with afferent white matter projections following the middle cerebellar peduncle. Conclusions: Knowledge of the precise neuroanatomy and white matter tracts of cerebellum may elucidate our ability to comprehend the clinical manifestations of cerebellar diseases in children. A solid understanding of normal cerebellar anatomy, development and functional fiber tracts in the pediatric patient can provide a baseline that may help predict the clinical outcome of various diseases or interventional procedures.",

Early diagnosis of GERD is essential in avoiding long-term sequelae such as growth delay, chronic lung disease, esophageal stricture, and esophagitis. Gastroesophageal reflux scintigraphy, a noninvasive imaging modality, has been applied for detection of GERD and gastric emptying in children over the past few decades. The radiation burden is considerably small given that a very low dose of radioactivity via a short half-life radioisotope like Technetium-99 m tagged to oral sulfur colloid is administered to a patient. This feature makes reflux scintigraphy especially attractive as the patient can be scanned for prolonged and delayed periods without increasing radiation dose permitting not only identification but also assessment of severity of GERD. Characterizing GERD severity is essential in determining how aggressive the pediatrician should be with therapy. Gastroesophageal reflux scintigraphy also allows a child to be fed their regular meal tagged to radiopharmaceutical without altering food taste. Qualitative and quantitative parameters like gastrointestinal transit and gastric emptying time can be measured, respectively. Scintigraphy is highly sensitive to low grade reflux making it very desirable for monitoring response to therapy. While scintigraphy like all other imaging modalities,has limitations, it continues to be an excellent technique for GERD identification and characterization as well as in monitoring response to GERD therapy.",

            "text": "Methods & Materials: DMSA scintigraphy is routinely performed in the nuclear medicine department with a single-head gamma camera (Siemens e.cam, Schaumberg, Illinois). About 1.5 h after injection of DMSA, posterior and posterior oblique images are obtained using parallel and pin hole collimators. Differential renal function is also calculated. DMSA scan reports containing the words \"duplex\" or \"duplicated\" from 2006-2011 were populated using a radiology search engine (Montage Health care Solutions Inc.). The images were then reviewed in PACS and representative examples were selected for the poster. The scans were evaluated for renal position, size, contour, any evidence of duplication and parenchymal damage. Results: Patterns of duplication included non complicated duplex kidney recognized by asymmetric renal size and a prominent cortical bar separating the two moieties, complicated duplex systems with hydronephrosis, scarring or pyelonephritis of one or both moieties. A small nonfunctioning upper moiety was sometimes evidenced by just an indentation along the superomedial aspect of the larger lower moiety. Cases with bilateral duplex kidneys were also seen. Illustrative examples of each will be provided. Correlating findings on other imaging modalities will also be included. Conclusions: Establishing the diagnosis of duplex kidney on a DMSA scan requires a careful systematic review of the images. The findings can be subtle and it is important for the radiologist to recognize them. Correlation with other modalities such as ultrasound or voiding cystogram can be complementary. The assessment of parenchymal function of the upper and lower moieties separately on DMSA scintigraphy can be of immense value in patient management and in choosing surgical options.",

The diagnostic utility, sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of 99 m-Tc bone imaging of benign conditions have long been established. In fact, more than 3,450,000 bone scans were performed in the United States in 2005. In this poster we will review the current indications for planar bone imaging for the evaluation of non-malignant diseases in the pediatric population, such as Acute Osteomyelitis secondary to Salmonella Enterobacteriaceae and tubercle bacillus (TB), chronic osteomyelitis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, spondylolysis, bone infarcts in the setting of sickle cell disease, fractures (occult/stress), ankylosing spondylitis, dermatomyositis and non-accidental trauma. The poster will also correlate planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging findings with appropriate additional imaging including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and plain film radiographs when clinically warranted and in keeping with the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle set forth by the American College of Radiology (ACR). Purpose or Case Report: We review the radiologic features of pathologic conditions linked to diesel exposure. The hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\") technique is increasingly used in many areas of the country to extract natural gas from rock formations. Diesel fuel, or fluids containing diesel, are one component of fracking fluid and create a potential for ground water contamination and risk to air quality. The toxic effects of diesel exhaust are described in the literature, and include asthma, hydrocarbon pneumonitis, and leukemia. There are no scientific data currently available on the effects of chronic diesel ingestion. Methods & Materials: Multi-modality examples of pathology were obtained from a radiology database at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. The specific cases displayed are not known to have diesel exposure, but are intended to serve as representative examples of the type of pathology that may be encountered in the setting of chronic diesel exposure. Results: Imaging findings of asthma include hyperexpansion, atelectasis, peribronchial thickening, and air-trapping. Hydrocarbon pneumonitis may demonstrate low attenuation consolidation and subsequent pneumoatocoeles with CT. Leukemia may present on plain radiographs with lucent metaphyseal bands and with marrow infiltration on MRI.",

Sinai Medical School, Henrietta.Rosenberg@mountsinai.org; Diane Belvin, Neil Lester Purpose or Case Report: Superficial soft tissue masses in the pediatric age range can be quite challenging to the pediatrician and the imager. The purpose of this presentation is to demonstrate the efficacy of duplex/color Doppler ultrasound for the diagnosis and follow up of a large gamut of superficial lumps and bumps. Methods & Materials: We reviewed our experience during the past 6 years using ultrasound to evaluate superficial soft tissue masses that had been encountered in many parts of the body, from the skull to the soles of the feet, in a large group of patients ranging in age from newborn to 21 years. All sonograms were performed after obtaining pertinent clinical information as well information regarding the clinical characteristics of each of the masses, e.g. location, consistency (firm [solid], compressible [cystic]), fixed or easily movable, smooth or irregular surface, tenderness. The masses were palpated by the imaging team and duplex/color Doppler ultrasound was performed. Comparison sonographic views of the opposite side were obtained as needed. Clinical followup and surgical/pathological correlation was obtained in most of the patients. Results: Most of the masses were benign and included a wide variety of etiologies. Most often, US was sufficient for assessment of soft tissue masses if the entire mass was included in the field of view. If the lesion was too large for the field of view or malignancy was suspected, CT/MRI were required preoperatively. Nuclear medicine studies are reserved for midline masses likely due to ectopic thyroid and PET was used for more complete evaluation of a lesion that was likely malignant. Conclusions: Duplex/color Doppler ultrasound (US) is the modality of choice for evaluation of superficial lumps and bumps! This modality allows for rapid acquisition of information without the use of ionizing radiation, intravenous contrast material, or sedation/anesthesia. Reliable information can be rapidly acquired regarding the size, shape, borders, location, internal consistency, vascularity, vascular encasement/displacement. Correlation of the ultrasound and clinical findings helps narrow differential diagnosis. Sonography helps to determine what is the next best step: watchful waiting (clinical observation, follow-up US), surgical resection, or US guided interventional procedure.",

Towbin Purpose or Case Report: Down syndrome is a common genetic condition characterized by unique physical traits and multisystem anomalies. The purpose of this exhibit is to portray the imaging findings of Down syndrome and discuss with illustrative examples, the use of imaging in multidisciplinary management. Methods & Materials: Published literature was reviewed to identify the multisystem imaging findings in Down syndrome. The electronic medical record system was then searched to find illustrative case examples from our institution. Results: In patients with Down syndrome, abnormalities can be found in the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems. Abnormalities can range from emergent, life threatening conditions such as malrotation with midgut volvulus to chronic conditions such as scoliosis. Examples of abnormalities from each organ system and the modalities used for diagnosis and management are described. Cardiovascular system: Echocardiogram and cardiac MRI and CT are useful in evaluating congenital heart disease associated with Down syndrome. Respiratory system: Micrognathia with macroglossia and hypotonia predisposes patients to sleep apnea which can be evaluated with dynamic MRI. Chest CT demonstrates subpleural cysts which are characteristic of this syndrome. Gastrointestinal system: Fluoroscopy and/or radiographs are the mainstay in diagnosing many gastrointestinal disorders including duodenal atresia, malrotation, annular pancreas, imperforate anus, and Hirschsprung disease. Central nervous system: Choroid plexus cysts may be identified on prenatal ultrasound in a fetus with Down syndrome. Imaging is used in the evaluation of epilepsy, hearing loss and Alzheimer disease that is more common in these individuals. Musculoskeletal system: Multiple skeletal anomalies can be present in patients with Down syndrome. Radiographs are often used as the method of identifying and, if needed, following the anomalies. Prenatal imaging: Increased nuchal translucency is the earliest imaging finding. Other features of Down syndrome can be identified on prenatal ultrasound or MRI. Prenatal imaging is helpful in determining the prognosis of the fetus and in guiding management. Conclusions: Modern day multidisciplinary management has improved quality of life and survival in individuals with Down syndrome. Imaging plays a critical role in guiding management in these individuals.",

As 90% of LM present by 2 years of age, these lesions represent an important pediatric entity. LM can often be suspected clinically in an infant with the classic presentation of an asymptomatic, soft mass in the head, neck, or axilla. However, myriad presentations are possible as LM occur in numerous other anatomic locations, can be multiple, and can be a component of mixed vascular malformations. In addition, the true extent of LM is often not apparent clinically. Given these considerations and the implications for proper management, imaging plays an important role in the assessment of LM.

Results: Images of LM involving the head and neck, chest, abdomen, retroperitoneum, extremities, and skeletal system were identified. In addition, cases of lymphangiomatosis and mixed venolymphatic malformation were identified. Various imaging modalities including radiography, CT, sonography, and MR were represented. Conclusions: Adequate knowledge of the imaging characteristics of LM across multiple modalities enables proper diagnosis, assessment of disease extent, and guidance of appropriate therapy in pediatric patients. Results: CT and MR imaging findings in nine cases will be presented. They include 1) Congenital absence of the inferior vena cava with thrombosis of the external iliac vein secondary to venous stasis 2) Pyelophlebitis complicating ruptured appendicitis 3) Left iliac vein thrombosis in a patient with May-Thurner syndrome 4) Splenic vein thrombosis complicating pancreatitis 5) Splenic vein thrombosis following splenectomy 6) Renal vein thrombosis in an infant of a diabetic mother 7) Adrenal vein thrombosis as the presenting sign of antiphospholipid syndrome 8) Budd-Chiari syndrome associated with underlying myeloproliferative disease 9) Iliac vein thrombosis as a manifestation of Behcet's syndrome (Hughes-Stovin syndrome, a variant of Behcet's syndrome, which presents with systemic venous thrombosis and pulmonary artery aneurysms will also be discussed). Conclusions: Thrombosis of large abdominal and pelvic veins in children and adolescents is uncommon. Certain conditions, both congenital and acquired, predispose to the development of venous thrombosis. CT/MR imaging defines the extent of thrombosis, and demonstrates additional findings that may elucidate the nature of the underlying condition leading to clot formation. Purpose or Case Report: Because abnormal gait in a young child has a wide range of causes, imaging plays a critical role in establishing the definitive diagnosis. The purpose of this exhibit is to review the clinical clues (age, duration, laboratory markers) and imaging findings of the causes of abnormal gait in a toddler and to assess the strengths and limitations of radiographs, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT). Methods & Materials: Cases, from a single institution experience with various causes for abnormal gait in a toddler, are reviewed and categorized into congenital, traumatic, inflammatory, neoplastic, or neuromuscular etiologies. Results: There are various causes of abnormal gait in a toddler. The congenital causes include spinal dysraphism, proximal and distal skeletal deformities and dysplasias. The traumatic causes include non-accidental trauma, toddler's fracture, foreign body, and soft tissue injuries. The inflammatory causes include juvenile idiopathic arthritis, transient synovitis, and infection, including osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, discitis, cellulitis, and abscess. The neoplastic causes include various neurogenic, bone, and soft tissue tumors. The neuromuscular causes include cerebral palsy and spinal bifida. The combination of clinical presentation, supporting laboratory findings, and classic imaging findings help to distinguish the possibilities and often allows confident diagnosis. Conclusions: Knowledge of imaging findings and clinical factors can demystify the diagnosis of abnormal gait in a toddler. Familiarity with the clinical presentation can ensure the performance of the appropriate diagnostic studies, timely diagnosis, and effective treatment. Nonaccidental causes should never be overlooked. Ultrasonography has become an important tool in the radiologist's armamentarium, augmenting radiography, MRI, and CT. Approximately 20 different contrast agents for MRI and CT are now commercially available for use. Although most of them are FDA approved in adults, information on usage and safety in children is not readily available. The most important reason is lack of controlled studies in children, especially for the age of 0-2 years. However, the lack of FDA approval has not limited the use of these promising agents in children. In fact, there is widespread off-label use of these agents in most major pediatric hospitals in the country. Based on a review of relevant literature in children, and based on a survey of radiology faculty at major pediatric hospitals, this poster will address the gap between approved use and reality in the setting of pediatrics. Results: Using a tabular format, this poster will provide a list of MR and CT contrast agents that are available for clinical use, their relevant clinical properties (ionic or nonionic, viscosity, linear or macrocyclic, degree of relaxivity for MRI, iodine concentration for CT, cost, dosage, halftime, incidence of allergic reactions, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and other adverse reactions), FDA approval status (for ages 0-30 days, 30 days-2 years, and 2-17 years), common pediatric applications, and contrast injection protocols for common applications. Conclusions: To enlighten imaging personnel about usage and safety of contrast agents in children.

Repeated infarction has some of its greatest visual and physiologic impact within the spleen. Continuous hemolysis, sequestration and vaso-occlusion within the spleen result in loss of splenic function early in life and frequently autosplenectomy thereafter. By 2 years of age, approximately 90% of children with hemoglobin SS disease will have diminished splenic function, putting them at increased risk for infections. Treatments for SCD have evolved over the last 20 years, and among others include penicillin prophylaxis and immunizations, Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy (or hypertransfusion program). Imaging findings are a reflection of the different treatments and their efficacy. Methods & Materials: Our institution cares for a large group of patients with Sickle Cell Disease, from birth to adulthood. This offers an unprecedented opportunity to document the imaging findings of the spleen with different treatment regimens, and over many years. The splenic size and morphology can be followed, by ultrasound, in a very straightforward way. We have compiled a pictorial essay of the various imaging characteristics of spleens from infants to adults. We also performed a literature review to compare and supplement the findings of our images. Results: There is a spectrum of imaging findings in the spleen of patients with SCD that changes from birth to childhood. The findings range from the normal appearance of a spleen to a calcified spleen, and include regenerative nodules, fibrosis, altered parenchymal echotexture, increased echogenicity, and changes in size, including enlargement secondary to sequestration. The ultrasound characteristics not only change with advancing age, but also appear to depend on whether or not the patient has received specific treatments, and at what age treatment was initiated. Conclusions: The ultrasound appearance of the spleen in patients with SCD is variable. Treatments such as blood transfusions and Hydroxyurea, patient compliance with therapy and type and severity of the disease are some of the factors that affect imaging characteristics.",

Results: The entities reviewed in this exhibit include, but are not limited to, congenital anomalies of tracheobronchial branching, airway malformations associated with situs, and congenital or acquired airway compression and/or obstruction. Conclusions: MDCT with volume visualization is a useful adjunct for evaluation of the pediatric central airways in a variety of pathologies. As a noninvasive technique, it avoids sedation risks and spare patients from complications associated with conventional flexible bronchoscopy. Low dose protocols should be used to minimize radiation exposure. bronchopulmonary foregut malformation that result from abnormal budding of the primitive foregut. Currently, many such anomalies are initially detected by prenatal ultrasound and are further delineated by fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while others may be incidentally detected on postnatal radiologic examinations or later in life in the setting recurrent pulmonary infection. Imaging plays a very important role in the diagnosis and characterization of these lesions and assists surgical planning. The purpose of our educational exhibit is to illustrate the common and uncommon radiologic appearances of CPAMs using various imaging modalities, including radiography, computed tomography, prenatal and postnatal ultrasound, and prenatal and postnatal MRI. Methods & Materials: All pediatric and adult CPAM (including both sequestration and CCAM) patients were identified using electronic medical records. Pertinent imaging reports (including radiography, prenatal and postnatal ultrasound, CT, and prenatal and postnatal MRI) were reviewed by a single author in order to identify relevant imaging findings. Relevant images from these imaging examinations were de-identified and saved to a secure hard drive. Medical records were accessed by a single researcher to obtain relevant demographic information as well as data regarding the patients' clinical presentations. In cases of corrective surgery, operative and pathology reports were reviewed, if available, for correlation with the imaging findings. Results: Cases of pediatric and adult CPAM were identified and presented in a variety of clinical contexts. Their appearances were reviewed through multiple imaging modalities.

Singh, Jennifer Soares, Lisa Young Purpose or Case Report: While adult interstitial lung disease is a well-described and fairly well understood group of disease processes, pediatric interstitial lung disease (ILD) remains a subject of uncertainty and misunderstanding for many clinicians and radiologists. Confusion surrounding the phenomenon of pediatric ILD stems not only from the rarity of the disease, but also from the extensive list of disease entities that can produce ILD, the existence of certain patterns that are restricted to infants and children and the fact that patterns of ILD manifest differently in a child's developing lung than in an already developed adult lung. Imaging plays an important role in diagnostic work-up of this disease and can guide lung biopsy in specific patient populations.",

We will include patients with biopsy proven ILD and will provide examples of the major ILDs, including clinical, radiologic and pathologic correlation. Our pictorial review will describe the radiologic patterns associated with the different forms of ILD, emphasizing what the radiologist needs to know and how to be helpful to a multidisciplinary team in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Results: The study will report the frequency of ILD at our institution, including a breakdown of the various subtypes of ILD. We will show examples of the subtypes with correlative chest radiography, computed tomography, and pathology. We plan to highlight specific differentiating factors between the different diseases and demonstrate how a radiologist can be helpful in collborating with clinicians in diagnosing and treating these diseases. Conclusions: Pediatric ILD can be a confusing topic for radiologists. Increasing knowledge and awareness of these diseases, their clinincal presentation, work up, and treatment is important for pediatric radiologists who work as part of of a multidiciplinary team.",

The examinations were performed between January and July 2011. 433 consecutive CT examinations (241 cranial, 192 abdominal) performed at our own institution were also reviewed. CTDIVOL and DLP were obtained from the dose report for each examination (32 cm-phantom for abdominal exams, 16 cm-phantom for cranial exams). Patient age and weight were obtained from the medical record. Results: Average CTDIVOL for abdominal CT performed by local community hospitals and imaging centers was 8.7 mGy, while average CTDIVOL was 4.3 mGy for abdominal CT performed at CHOA. There was a wide variation in CT radiation dose delivered. While some sites delivered a CT radiation dose comparable to our own, others delivered a substantially greater dose. In fact, 23% of pediatric abdominal CT exams performed by local community hospitals and imaging centers exceeded the Notification Value recommended by the AAPM (10 mGy using the 32cm phantom). Low kVp technique for imaging small children was infrequent. Multi-phase examinations were more often performed, resulting in additional elevation in CT radiation dose when DLP is considered. Average CTDIVOL delivered by local community hospitals and imaging centers for cranial CT was 44 mGy compared to a CTDIVOL of 30 mGy for cranial CT performed at CHOA. 8% of pediatric cranial CT exams performed by local community hospitals and imaging centers exceeded the Notification Value recommended by the AAPM (60 mGy for 2-5 years, 80 mGy for >5 years). Conclusions: Despite ongoing efforts at education, there is wide variation in CT radiation dose delivered for pediatric abdominal and cranial CT examinations performed by local community hospitals and imaging centers. Appropriate use of dose check software on newer scanners may help reduce the number of children subjected to excessive CT radiation dose. Ultimately, each site performing pediatric CT must take responsibility for minimizing radiation dose while producing diagnostic quality exams.",

Image noise, spatial and contrast resolution, contrast noise ratio (CNR) and Wiener spectrum analysis were performed on 0.625 mm Ax, 5 mm Ax MPR and 2 mm Cor MPR series. Results: 50% ASIR resulted in a mean decrease in noise of 30% (0.625 mm Ax), 26% (Ax MPR) and 28% (Cor MPR) and improvement in CNR of 38-49%. Incremental advantage was seen with stepwise increase in ASIR %. However, application of ASIR was associated with a small reduction in spatial resolution (2-8% at 50% ASIR). Low contrast detectability (LCD) improved except at the smallest target lesion size. Image quality effects at very low mAs and at high ASIR % will be presented.",

These studies optimally demonstrate complex anatomy, streamlining communication between members of the healthcare team and providing a tool for communicating complex anatomy and treatment options with families. These studies have been ordered with more frequency over the past five years. We retrospectively reviewed the types of congenital heart disease demonstrated by cardiac 3D CTA over the past five years at a congenital heart center. Methods & Materials: Color coded cardiac CTA postprocessing was performed from ECG gated prospective and retrospective CTA data on a commercially available workstation for 333/395 patients over the past three years. The anatomy was initially segmented and colored into individual parts of the anatomy of the heart and great vessels as follows RV 0 purple, LV 0 light red, aorta 0 red, pulmonary arteries 0 blue, systemic veins and right atrium 0 aqua, pulmonary veins and left atrium 0 pink, PDA or collaterals 0 green, airway 0 yellow, coronary arteries 0 neutral. The anatomy was then reassembled and images obtained every 3\u00b0in a 360\u00b0rotation for display. Results: 3D color coded CTA images were used in the treatment and care of congenital heart patients for the following types of congenital heart diseases: 124 cases of complex anatomy (TGA, truncus arteriosus, HLHS, tricuspid atresia, TOF\u2026), 67 coronary artery anomalies, 68 cases of pulmonary atresia or stenosis, 44 cases of systemic and venous anomalies, 40 cases of coarctation or interruption of the aortic arch, and 56 tracheobronchial tree anomalies. Conclusions: Color coded cardiac CTA post-processing is an effective and viable method for demonstrating anatomy in complex congenital heart patients. It is an excellent tool for demonstrating anatomy which is difficult to see by echocardiography such as: coronary artery anomalies, pulmonic atresia, aortic arch coarctation or interruption, and tracheobronchial anomalies and/or stenosis.",

Results: Recent studies showed that patients treated with cooling had a more favorable prognosis than was suggested by the clinical grade of encephalopathy compared with infants treated with standard care. Our institutional protocol includes the performance of MRI, and Ultrasound. CT is performed when is a clinical impossibility of perform MRI. Brain ultrasound was performed in all the 15 patients. MRI scans were obtained in 11 neonates. CT was obtained in 3 patients. All MRI studies included DWI. The utility of DWI and ADC maps as an aid in diagnosis of non-ischemic lesions is becoming increasingly established. MRI evidence of brain injury was visible on basal ganglia in 8 cases with negative ultrasound. Abnormal signal intensity in the posterior limb of the internal capsule coexists with lesions in the basal ganglia and thalami have been associated with abnormal motor outcome. The remaining 3 newborns did not develop significant MRI evidence of brain injury. It has been suggested that the ability of MRI to predict subsequent neurological impairment is unaltered by therapeutic hypothermia. Further research is needed for defining the relation between MRI findings and cooling. It is possible that imaging findings might be delayed in cooled infants.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability to measure blood flow into and out of the liver with time resolved volumetric (4D) phase contrast MRI in the pediatric patient. Methods & Materials: Nineteen consecutive patients were retrospectively identified who underwent 4D flow imaging through the level of the hepatic vessels on 1.5 T and 3 T magnets. A software enabling 4D flow program was utilized to first assess for the feasibility of measurement of flow in the hepatic artery (HA), portal vein (PV), splenic vein (SPV), superior mesenteric vein (SMV), supra (SIVC) and infrahepatic (IIVC) inferior vena cava. If measurable, calculations were performed to evaluate for internal consistency by comparing the sum of SMV and SPV flow to PV flow. Calculations were then performed to compare hepatic inflow (PV+HA) to hepatic outflow (SIVC-IIVC) and for the percentage of PV and HA contribution to hepatic inflow. Results: Of the nineteen patients, all of the above mentioned six vessels were visualized and measurable in two patients, both of which were imaged on the 1.5 T magnet. In the remaining patients, flow measurements were limited by respiratory motion artifacts obscuring the smaller vessels, and severe eddy currents, particularly in patients imaged with the 3 T magnet. The evaluation for internal consistency demonstrated an average of 1.2% (0.06% & -1.5%) difference between SMV+SPV and PV flow. Hepatic inflow was found to closely match the measured hepatic outflow with an average difference of 11.1% (19.1% & 3.1%). The portal vein was found to contribute 82.9% and 87.3% to hepatic inflow, while the hepatic artery contributed 17.1% and 12.7%. Conclusions: Measurement of hepatic flow with phase contrast MRI is more challenging than assessment of thoracic flow. When respiratory artifacts are minimal, vessels can be identified and measurements have internal consistency and good agreement between hepatic inflow and outflow at 1.5 T. Conversely, flow measurements were limited at 3 T by eddy currents. Thus, ongoing efforts are aimed at mitigating respiratory motion artifacts at 1.5 T.",

Gupta Purpose or Case Report: As advances in congenital heart disease continue to improve both mortality and quality of life, associated complications are becoming more prevalent. Amongst patients who have had Fontan repair for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspic atresia, or other right heart dysfunction, it is well known that liver disease is a complication. We describe the MRI findings in post-Fontan patients and propose MRI as a useful tool to the hepatologist's evaluation of these patients. Methods & Materials: IRB approval was obtained for a retrospective review of 29 patients who underwent Fontan repair and were subsequently referred for hepatology evaluation between 2010-2011. All but one patient was scanned on a SiemensTrioTrim 3 T magnet; one patient was scanned on a GE Twinspeed 1.5 T magnet with an equivalent protocol due to orthodontics.

Fibrosis was determined based on a specific pattern of delayed reticular enhancement in combination with liver morphology. Congestion was deemed present if there was increased T2 signal in the liver parenchyma or periportal regions in combination with cloud-like enhancement on dynamic post-contrast images. All patients demonstrated morphologic changes in the liver with varying degrees of hepatic fibrosis and hepatic congestion. Fibrotic changes were often non-uniform, and thus could be underdiagnosed by biopsy. Interestingly, 4 patients, 24%, had focal arterially enhancing lesions speculated to represent vascular proliferative lesions, however, none warranted biopsy. Conclusions: It is established that patients who undergo Fontan develop hepatic abnormalities. MRI is a reliable, non invasive technique that accurately demonstrates these findings.

The goals of this study were to determine rates of procedurebased complications based on severity, to establish thresholds for complications, and to determine whether measurable trends in complications over time were evident. Methods & Materials: Between 2004 and 2010, 14,042 interventional procedures were performed within the division of interventional radiology at our institution. Adverse events were characterized both according to level of severity (using an institutional 5 point severity scale), and with brief descriptions of individual events. Adverse events were reviewed monthly at the division's morbidity and mortality conference, with respect to procedure type and operator. Based on review of our interventional radiology data and benchmarks rates used for diagnostic errors, threshold complication rates were established by consensus between the department quality improvement committee and the division of interventional radiology. For severe events (Level 4 and 5) there is no allowable threshold; all such events were subjected to both internal and institutional review. Results: The overall complication rate was less than 1% for all procedures performed. The complication rates for the respective severity levels were: Level 1 (0.235), Level 2 (0.3), Level 3 (0.1), Level 4 (0.249), and Level 5 (0.028). The severity of a given complication was not associated with procedural complexity. No operator-specific trends were identified. Conclusions: Since 2003, the Society of Interventional Radiology has offered guidelines and strategies for improving safety and quality in interventional radiology. However, no specific benchmark data or procedural recommendations are available for pediatric interventional procedures. Our results demonstrate rates of complications well below published overall complication rates for interventional radiologic procedures. This database of procedure-based complications serves as a foundation for a quality improvement program that allows review of complications with respect to specific procedure types, individual operators, and procedural complexity, in an effort to institute an ongoing and continuous process of quality improvement within interventional radiology. Purpose or Case Report: Dysosteosclerosis (DSS), an extremely rare dense bone disease, features short stature and fractures and sometimes optic atrophy, cranial nerve palsy, developmental delay, and failure of tooth eruption in infancy or early childhood consistent with osteopetrosis (OPT). Bone histology during childhood shows unresorbed primary spongiosa from deficient osteoclast action. Additionally, there is remarkable progressive flattening of all vertebrae mimic PPi blocking mineralization. During EHDP treatment for GACI, In our patient prolonged high dose EHDP resulted in severe skeletal deformity resembling hypophosphatasia which was reversable with drug stoppage. Methods & Materials: A 7-year-old boy with GACI referred for profound, acquired, progressive skeletal deformity. He was receiving 200 mg/day of EHDP and was wheelchair bound. We studied him and his response to stopping EHDP. Results: Skeletal radiographic findings resembled pediatric hypophosphatasia with pancranial synostosis, widened physes with metaphyseal osteosclerosis, \"tongues\" of radiolucency, along with cupping and fraying, and long-bone bowing. In addition there were large intra and extraarticular calcifications. Radiographic features of BP-induced OPT included femoral Erlenmeyer flask deformity and osteosclerosis (lumbar sine DXA z-score +5.7). Biochemical parameters of mineral homeostasis were essentially normal although serum osteocalcin was low and he had markedly elevated serum levels of creatine kinase and TRAP-5b consistent with osteopetrosis (OPT). After stopping EHDP, he improved quickly with remarkable healing of his rachitic appearing skeleton and decreased joint calcifications. Conclusions: Our patient with GACI had profound skeletal deformities from high-dose EHDP therapy that significatly improved with drug stoppage.",

Defining the most useful approaches and MRI sequences, to facilitate identification and early diagnosis of lesions with the potential to predict outcome and abnormal neurodevelopment. Methods & Materials: Reviewed available evidence on MRI strategies for evaluating infants with Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Different cases illustrating lesions are presented and discussed for proper diagnosis correlating physiopathology and imaging appearance. More relevant findings are depicted with didactic illustrations. Identifying studies where new techniques such as DWI, ADC, DTI, SWI, or MRS adds significant diagnostic value to the overall interpretation. Results: MRI is routinely performed as a very sensitive method for detection of HIE lesions. Advanced MR techniques, such as DTI, DWI, ADC, MRS, SWI offer the possibility of detecting injuries at a time when intervention is theoretically possible. The understanding of the physiopathology allows for prediction of the location and extent of lesions, facilitating identification and appropriate classification. The identification of infants with potentially abnormal neurodevelopment, offers the opportunity to provide therapeutic neurodevelopmental interventions in early childhood. MRS is the best MR biomarker to predict neurodevelopmental outcome in asphyxiated full-term neonates. Brain metabolite ratios and regional ADC values may vary between MR systems and coils. Development of normal values for each institution is required, and support of physicists is mandatory. Conclusions: MRI continues to evolve as a valuable adjunctive tool routinely obtained in nearly all cases of HIE. Advanced MRI techniques increase sensitivity of conventional T1 and T2-W images and outperform computer tomography and ultrasound for confirming the diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury or providing prognostic information for the care of patient with HIE.

Medical College, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India, amitsensation@yahoo.co.in Purpose or Case Report: The aim of this exhibit is to demonstrate various conditions involving the posterior fossa in children with emphasis on importance of embryologic development of cerebellum in reaching a correct diagnosis. Methods & Materials: This pictographic presentation displays the imaging features of cases encountered in our clinical practice on 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Results: With the advent of MR imaging, there has been a revolution in identification and characterization of malformations of the brain This is especially true in posterior fossa, where the sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging with its multidimensional imaging capability are far superior to those of computed tomography (CT) in the detection of subtle morphologic abnormalities. However, there is still a great deal of confusion regarding their classification, terminology, and spectrum of expression and this is where neuroembryology is of great help. This exhibit demonstrates : 1) Review of embryology and normal anatomy of cerebellum. 2) MR appearance of spectrum of conditions involving posterior fossa in children which includes developmental abnormalities (Dandy-Walker complex, Arnold Chiari malformations, cerebellar dysplasia/ hypoplasia, Joubert's syndrome, etc.), cysts (arachnoid cyst, giant cisterna magna etc.), tumours (medulloblastoma, ependymoma, hemangioblastoma etc.) and miscellaneous conditions. significantly reduces dose (1/3 of other gadolinium based contrast agents), and doesn't require trigger imaging. Conventional MRI provides important information regarding the anatomical extent, size, and relation to critical anatomical structures thus when combined with TWIST, MRI provides the best information without use of radiation in children.",

Poliakov, PhD, Radiology, Seattle Children's Hospital; David Bauer, Edward Novotny, Seth D. Friedman, Dennis Shaw, Jeff Ojemann Purpose or Case Report: Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is a way to evaluate cortical networks across different modalities such as motor, sensory, vision, and the default mode network using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. fcMRI relies on correlation in fMRI image intensity that occurs between functionally connected regions. This effect can be seen in awake as well as anesthetized patients. We evaluated these pathways in pediatric patients with brain tumors. Methods & Materials: Patients were randomly selected from our tumor database. Inclusion criteria included age less than 18, history of brain tumor resection, and complete fcMRI data. Imaging was performed on a 3 T Siemens Trio system. Functional MRI data were acquired as part of a clinical imaging protocol over 6.5 -8 min using a gradient echo, echo-planar sequence. Preprocessing of fMRI data followed by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was performed using FSL software. Functional connectivity analysis was performed using software provided by 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, based on AFNI and FSL software packages. Correlation maps were produced by extracting the BOLD time course from a seed region, computing the correlation coefficient between that time course and the time course from all other brain voxels, correcting for multiple sampling and degrees of freedom and thresholded at a z value of 3.0. Results: Fourteen patients were included in the study, eight female and six male. Tumor types include ganglioglioma (5), pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (2), juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (2), ependymoma (1), anaplastic astrocytoma (1), glioblastoma multiforme (2), and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (1). Seven patients had tumor-associated epilepsy, and seven patients did not. The figure shows connectivity patterns in the motor network in patients without (A) and with (B) epilepsy. In the patients without epilepsy, functional connectivity was often displaced but not decreased or absent. In the patients with epilepsy, we observed decreased or absent functional connectivity. Similar results were found for default mode network: connectivity was diminished or absent in the patients affected by epilepsy. Conclusions: fcMRI is a novel technique that may prove useful for evaluation and presurgical planning by giving us insight into how tumors disrupt function. Functional connectivity was often displaced but relatively preserved in the patients without epilepsy. It was disrupted or absent in the patients with epilepsy.",

Patients consecutively selected from institutional data base; inclusion criteria: established diagnosis of NF1, brain imaging with DTI sequence, abnormally high corpus callosum to skull ratio; excluded were patients with complications of NF1 that could affect size of the corpus callosum. Age and gender matched normal controls were randomly selected from the radiology data base. ROI were placed manually over the corpus callosum for DTI measurements using DTI-Studio by two independent researchers, one blinded to diagnosis. Results: Fifteen NF1 patients and matched controls were analyzed. The corpus callosum to skull ratio was found to be significantly different between the experimental and control group (p00.0001). For NF1 patients we found: a trend to lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, p00.067), significantly higher radial diffusivity (p00.023), significantly lower axial diffusivity (p00.0002), and significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA, p00.0012). Conclusions: The significantly lower axial diffusivity in NF1 can indicate that there are more crossing fibers in the corpus callosum of NF1 patients than in normal controls. Further studies using comparative DTI tractography may be helpful in further investigating this stipulation. The significant increase in radial diffusivity can be explained by a variety of factors, including thinner myelin sheaths, increased interstitial fluid, smaller axons, or a combination thereof. The trend of lower ADC may indicate low axonal diameter, as ADC has been shown to more strongly correlate with axonal diameter without the myelin sheath. In future studies we will correlate abnormal corpus callosum DTI markers with cognitive functions in NF1 patients to see if relationships exist that can be used as predictors of cognitive deficits in NF1 patients.",

Methods & Materials: After IRB approval we reviewed all skeletal surveys performed at Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC) in the last 10 years and selected the children who were evaluated for suspected non-accidental fracture. We determined if 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level was requested for these patients and characterized the provider's clinical suspicion of vitamin D deficiency as high or low. Per the 2010 Institute of Medicine Report and 2011 Endocrine Society Guidelines we defined vitamin D deficiency as a 25 (OH)D level of less than 20 ng/mL. We calculated the prevalence of children with low 25(OH)D levels whose providers had low clinical suspicion for vitamin D deficiency. Results: 396 skeletal surveys were done at TAMC from November 2000 to July 2011. 99 were performed after identifying a suspected non-accidental fracture. Of these patients 11 children from ages 1 to 7 months had 25(OH)D levels requested. For children whose providers had a low pre-test suspicion for vitamin D deficiency, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 12.5% (95% binomial CI 0.003-0.524, 1 of 8 cases. These results indicate that at least one out of every three hundred children evaluated for nonaccidental fracture could have vitamin D deficiency despite a low clinical suspicion by their provider, although the actual rate is likely much higher given that we found one in eight cases. The child we identified with a low Vitamin D level whose provider had no suspicion for rickets was treated with Ergocalciferol and continued to be evaluated for abuse. Conclusions: Routine vitamin D level screening after nonaccidental fracture may detect vitamin D deficiency in children for whom there is low clinical suspicion. As our population resides at a low latitude and receives greater than average sun exposure, the rate of deficiency in children with suspected non-accidental fracture may be much greater in other areas.",

Methods & Materials: Ultrasonographic images in patients less than 18 years of age were reviewed. Cases were selected that showed classic artifacts which helped with the diagnosis of a variety of entities. Results: Ultrasound artifacts include comet tail, reverberation, ring down and \"dirty\" shadowing. These can be used to help characterize a variety of pediatric conditions including gossypiboma, bezoar, subcutaneous foreign body, complications of NEC, and staghorn calculus. Artifacts can also be used to confirm the presence of stool or bowel gas.

Nhi Huynh, MD, Radiology, St. Joseph Hospital and Medical Center, e.nhihuynh@gmail.com; Todd Chapman, Randy Richardson Purpose or Case Report: Tracheobronchial compression or narrowing secondary to a vascular ring has been well documented. The purpose of this study is to describe the frequency of airway compression secondary to an enlarged patent ductus arteriosus detected by CCTA without the presence of a vascular ring. Methods & Materials: A retrospective study of 282 CCTA exams in infants was performed over the period between 03/ 28/2007 and 09/28/2011. CCTA was performed with a 64-slice MDCT, with EKG gating, followed by three-dimensional reformations. Results: Of the 282 congenital heart disease infant patients, there are 49 patients with tracheobronchial compression or narrowing. Of these 49 patients, 20 patients reported to have patent ductus arteriosus as the primary cause of tracheobronchial compression or narrowing. Approximately 41% of patients with airway compression in patients with congenital heart disease are secondary to an enlarged and/or tortuous patent ductus arteriosus. None of these cases were due to a vascular ring. Of these 20 patients, 10, 6, and 4 patients demonstrated to have mild, moderate, and severe airway compression respectively. Conclusions: Tracheobronchial compression or narrowing secondary to vascular ring with a patent ductus arteriosus has been well documented. In this study, we demonstrate that a significant percentage of airway compression in patients with congenital heart disease without a vascular ring is due to a tortuous enlarged patent ductus arteriosus. Cardiac CTA is uniquely equipped to evaluate airway compression due to an enlarged patent ductus arteriosus and can help improve patient care in congenital heart disease patients with respiratory symptomatology.",

Towbin Purpose or Case Report: A wide variety of pediatric liver disorders may be complicated by the development of liver fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. With early interventions, the progression to hepatic fibrosis can be slowed, halted, and in some cases reversed. Liver biopsy has long been considered the gold standard for assessing the presence and degree of liver fibrosis. However, liver biopsy has disadvantages, due to its potential sampling error, risk of complications, relatively high cost, intra-and inter-observer variability, and, in general, poor acceptance by pediatric patients and their parents. MR elastography (MRE) is a relatively new, non-invasive technique that provides a safe, rapid and cost-effective method for objectively evaluating of a wide variety of hepatic diseases by quantitative stiffness evaluation of the liver-parenchyma. The purpose of this exhibit is to review our clinical experience with this technique and illustrate the application of liver MRE in the pediatric population at our medical center. Methods & Materials: A review of pathogenesis and staging of liver fibrosis in children and current methods available for assessing liver fibrosis will be provided. A review of MRE physics and technique, including the specific liver MRE protocol used at our institution will be illustrated. We will review widely-used and emerging clinical indications for liver MRE, as well as benefits and limitations to the technique, supported by brief literature review.",

Results: With the advent of the newer modalities, the utility of the plain skaigram has been largely limited a initial screening tool only. Whereas CT scores over MRI in pulmonary TB (parenchymal disease, lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, empyema, miliary disease) and abdominal TB (spectrum from mesenteric lymphadenitis to visceral involvement), the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is much better in diagnosing CNS TB (tuberculoma, abscess, meningitis, subdural empyema and myelitis). In musculoskeletal and genitourinary TB, CT and MR imaging may be preferred based on the stage of disease and the character of the lesion. Cardiac involvement (pericarditis) is among the less common affections of TB. Conclusions: Tuberculosis is a multisystem disease that can affect virtually any part of the body from head to toe. TB demonstrates a variety of clinical and radiologic findings and has a known propensity for dissemination from its primary site and therefore can mimic numerous other disease entities. Hence it is imperative for radiologists to understand the typical disease distribution, patterns and imaging manifestations of TB. ",

TWIST and conventional MRI was performed (Triplanar T2-Weighted [T2-W] imaging with fat saturation, pre-contrast axial T1-Weighted [T1-W] imaging, and post contrast triplanar fat-suppressed T1-W imaging). TWIST was performed in coronal plane using blood-pool MR contrast agent (Ablavar-Lantheus) to enhance image quality and spatial resolution of MRA. Two pediatric neuroradiologists evaluated all patients in two different sessions, 15 days apart: one session conventional MRI with contrast was evaluated, in the second session TWIST was evaluated. Clinical evaluation and/or percutaneous venogram/lymphogram data were the gold standard. Results: Our patients had diagnosis of infantile hemangioma (n04), venous malformation (n012), and lymphatic malformation (n012). TWIST alone could accurately classify 26/ 28, conventional MRI with contrast could accurately classify 22/28. Conventional MRI with contrast combined with TWIST could accurately classify all cases. Conclusions: TWIST offers high temporal resolution in the order of seconds, and provides functional data about the dynamics of contrast enhancement comprising the arterial, venous and delayed venous phases",

Average rates of change of the saline and HSA systems were 0.39 vs. 0.06 at 60 min; 0.46 vs. 0.04 at 120 min; and 0.35 vs. 0.03 at 180 min. Doxycycline/HSA was injected as a stable foam in all ABC and LM treatments, visible as a static air echogenicity or lucency on both ultrasound and fluoroscopic imaging, and visible on CT imaging after 3 days in 2 patients (1-ABC, 1-LM). Conclusions: Doxycycline as a protein bound therapy agent, targeting tumor cells of ABC and endothelial cells of LM, is slowly eluted when mixed with an HSA drug delivery system, as demonstrated in an in-vitro elution system. Clinical correlation in 1496 injections confirms the stable foam injection and delayed foam dissipation, in both ABC and LM patients.

Amaral, MD Pediatric interventional radiology has evolved from diagnostic angiography alone to multiple image guided minimally invasive procedures in children.Interventional angiography, vascular access, gastrointestinal access, drainages and biopsies were the first areas that pediatric interventional radiologists (IR) adopted. New devices, better imaging equipment, new imaging modalities, research and experience allowed pediatric IR to develop new techniques and procedures.Nowadays, some of the new non-vascular procedures offered by pediatric IR include:& Botulin toxin injection into salivary glands (off-label use) to reduce drooling symptoms in children with cerebral palsy and significant sialorrhea; & Use of fibrinolytics in complex and loculated pleural effusions to improve drainage, reduce hospital stay and avoid surgical intervention; & Thoracic duct embolization in patients with severe chylothorax that does not respond to medical measures to stop drainage of chyle; & Topical application of Mitomicyn C to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and reduce scarring in recurrent esophageal strictures; & Balloon dilatation of bowel in patients with post-surgical strictures to avoid surgical reintervention; Thermal therapies such as laser or radiofrequency ablation of osteoid osteomas and cryoablation of renal tumors;",

Six patients had negative FDG PET/CT scans for infection, one subsequently diagnosed with endocarditis. Conclusions: FDG PET/CT diagnosed all 5 cases of surgically proven spinal rod infection in our series of 19 patients. Other causes of back pain including hardware loosening and superficial incision/wound infection were also reliably diagnosed. PET/CT identified an alternate infection, pneumonia, in three patients. FDG PET/CT is a reliable test in patients with spinal hardware and FUO and/or suspected spinal infection.",

Anupindi, Monica Epelman Purpose or Case Report: To illustrate clinical utility of advanced imaging techniques in pre-and post-operative assessment of children with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) being evaluated for a Rex Shunt procedure.Methods & Materials:We performed a retrospective review of the medical records and pre-and post-operative imaging of patients with EHPVO who underwent a Rex shunt. Demographics, etiology of EHPVO, presenting symptoms before and after surgery and details of the procedure were recorded. Imaging included: 2D Doppler US, 2D & 3D CTV and MRV exams. 3D imaging, such as multiplanar reconstructions, maximum intensity projections (MIP) and/or volume rendered displays, and liver volumes were performed on a dedicated 3D workstation. Pre-surgery imaging evaluated patency and size of the internal jugular vein, portal vein and branches, and superior mesenteric vein, presence or absence intrinsic liver disease. Post-operatively we evaluated patency of the Rex, flow in LPV and intrahepatic branches, decrease in size of collaterals, decrease in splenomegaly, and liver volumes. Results: There were 5 patients identified who underwent the Rex shunt procedure. 1 patient had only preoperative US performed, and was excluded. We retrospectively evaluated 2D & 3D images of 8 CTV and 4 MRV in 4 patients (2 F:2 M, mean age 4 yr, range 2-9 yr). Indications for the surgery included portal hypertension, recurrent variceal bleeding and splenomegaly. In the preoperative setting, CTV and MRV was performed in all patients and Doppler US in 2 patients. In the postoperative setting, 2 patients had US and all had CTV and/or MRV. In all patients, conventional 2D imaging incompletely demonstrated small portal veins and hypoplastic intrahepatic portal veins. Preoperative 3D reconstructions improved depiction of these abnormal findings critical for preoperative planning. No patient required catheter portal venography to confirm 3-D features. Pre & post Rex shunt liver volumes were calculated in 3 pts which increased by at least 30% on post op imaging confirming improved shunt function and permeability. No postprocedural complications occurred. Conclusions: US is commonly used as first-line evaluation for pre-and post-operative evaluation of a Rex Shunt. In the author's experience CTV should be utilized when US is not feasible as it can better delineate vascular pathology. Our cases illustrate the feasibility of rendering 3D images and the clinical role of advanced imaging for the pre-procedural planning.Advantages of a Nanoparticle Blood Pool Contrast AgentOver Conventional Intravascular Glomerular-Filtered Contrast Agents for Pulmonary Vascular Imaging Ketan Ghaghada, Radiology, Texas Children's Hospital, kbghagha@texaschildrens.org; Ananth Annapragada, R.

Spelic Purpose or Case Report: The ACR-SPR Practice Guideline for General Radiography calls for technique charts tailored to a range of pediatric patient sizes. Only a single U.S. survey of pediatric radiography technique factors from 1998 exists (Nationwide Evaluation of Xray Trends) for a single study, pediatric chest. The purpose of our study is to develop technique charts for digital x-ray equipment, categorized by detector type and manufacturer, based on selected routine radiographic exams. Methods & Materials: An Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Radiology survey was sent to the Society of Chairmen of Radiology Departments at Children's Hospitals and vendors through the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance. The exams included: neonatal chest; 5-year-old for two-view chest, supine abdomen, and three-view wrist; 13-year-old two-view scoliosis. The survey requested patient parameters (age, weight, or body part thickness) used to determine radiographic technique factors; use of manual technique or automatic exposure control; the exposure factors (kVp, mAs, grids, SID); and the type and range of exposure indicator (proprietary indicator or new International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) exposure index standard).

Methods & Materials: Retrospective review of MRI elbow studies performed at The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne between 2003 and . The studies were reviewed by a Pediatric Musculoskeletal Radiologist and Pediatric Radiology Fellow with patient demographics, clinical indication, findings and selected images recorded. Results: 199 elbow MRI examinations were reviewed on children aged 4 months to 18 years (123 boys, 76 girls) with equal numbers of left and right sides examined. Clinical indications included previous trauma in 147 cases (74%) and nontraumatic conditions in 52 (26%). The most common traumatic indication was suspected or confirmed fractures or avulsions (21%) followed by osteochondral or cartilage injuries (18%), growth arrest (16%), loose bodies (14%) and ligament injuries (10%). Hemophilia (38%) was the most frequent nontraumatic indication followed by neoplasm (17%). Mild to severe arthropathy, fractures, physeal growth arrest, subluxations, osteochondral lesions and loose bodies were the most frequently demonstrated abnormalities. Ligament strains and tears, bone oedema, neuromuscular abnormalities, infections and several neoplasms including lipomas, vascular/lymphatic malformations and bone tumors also featured.

The electronic medical record system was then searched to find illustrative case examples from our institution. Cases demonstrating the primary imaging findings as well cases highlighting complications of the disease or its therapy were selected. Results: CNS involvement is common in HLH with approximately 75% of patients demonstrating neurological symptoms. CT findings of CNS involvement include diffuse parenchymal atrophy, low attenuation lesions in the white matter and calcifications. MR findings include diffuse leptomeningeal and perivascular enhancement, T2 hyperintense lesions with nodular or rim enhancement as well as confluent white matter lesions, and diffuse parenchymal volume loss of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Restricted diffusion has been demonstrated in some lesions. Ring enhancing parenchymal lesions have been described representing active demyelination. Intracranial hemorrhage may occur as a result of thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities. Sepsis with opportunistic organisms can involve the CNS and produce intracranial findings such as parenchymal abscesses. CNS changes, such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, are also seen with the commonly used immunomodulatory regimen used in the treatment of HLH. Conclusions: This exhibit will aid the viewer in identifying the CNS imaging findings of HLH as well as the complications of the disease and its therapy. While the CNS imaging findings are not specific, they may help the radiologist formulate a diagnosis in association with the other clinical and imaging findings; furthermore, imaging can help the clinical team in managing the disease and its complications. Methods & Materials: Medical records of our pediatric patients with palpable head masses over the last 5 years, were reviewed and images were collected. Correlation of US of these lesions with other imaging modalities and/or pathologic diagnosis was done. Results: US appearances of various head masses including congenital/developmental (encephalocele, meningocele, dermoid, occipital protuberance), traumatic (cephalhematoma, subgaleal hematoma, calvarial fracture), inflammatory/infectious (sebaceous cyst, histiocytosis, dermatitis), vascular (malformations, pseudoaneurysm) and neoplastic (benign and malignant lesions including metastases) etiologies, will be illustrated with case based approach. MRI and/or CT or tissue diagnosis can be problem solving. Role of ultrasound guidance for percutaneous procedures (biopsy, sclerotherapy) will also be described. Conclusions: Ultrasound can play an important role in the delineation, diagnosis and guiding further management of pediatric palpable head masses. US can differentiate various scalp lesions and suggest the underlying calvarial defect or involvement to some extent, helping to narrow the differential diagnosis for such lesions. Color doppler US can be useful to detect vascularity within the lesion or vascular lesions. Given that US is often requested for the evaluation of palpable head masses, pediatric radiologists should be familiar with their sonographic features.",

Byrne Purpose or Case Report: Posterior fossa malformations are a group of central nervous system anomalies that may be detected during pregnancy or present early infancy with features that include hypotonia, developmental delay, mutations responsible for the disease and proposals as to mechanism of action of the mutation with respect to disease manifestations. This preceded the development of hypotheses regarding the relationship between genotype and phenotype and the attempt to utilize imaging modalities that could better assess disease activity as it related to functional status. The purpose of this exhibit is to briefly review the history pre-1989 and to focus on the numerous ways in which the understanding has improved since that time. Conclusions: 1. There are over 1000 different mutations of the CFTR gene responsible for cystic fibrosis with varying prevalence throughout the world. 2. The class of mutation often dictates its particular mechanism of action. 3. There is some relationship between genotype and phenotype-particularly with respect to pancreatic involvement. 4.

Handan Cakmakci, Pediatric Radiology, Dokuz Eylul University Hospital, handancakmakci@gmail.com; Nevin Uzuner, Filiz Tetik Purpose or Case Report: Early diagnosis and treatment are very important for infants with tuberculosis. Infantile pulmonary tuberculosis is more symptomatic, and the risk of severe and life-threatening complications such as tuberculous meningitis or miliary tuberculosis is higher. Bacteriologic confirmation of the disease in children is difficult and in younger infants (<3 months), the tuberculin skin test is frequently negative. Therefore, radiological findings play important role in diagnosing tuberculosis in infants. The purposes of this study are to identify chest x-ray and lung CT findings in pulmonary tuberculosis of infants and consider the most useful diagnostic findings of these age group patients.Methods & Materials: Chest radiographs and chest CT images of 7 infants who were diagnosed in our hospital from 2005 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The study group included 2 boys and 5 girls ranging in age from 2 to 12 months (mean age, 6 months). Chest x-ray and computed tomography images were analyzed considering air space consolidation, nodular lesions, cavitating lesions, mediastinal enlargement, hyperinflation, bronchial narrowing, atelectasis pleural effusion on plain radiography and additional mediastinal calcific or caseating lymph nodes on CT images.Results: Air space consolidation was seen on 5 out of 7 chest x-ray and computed tomography images. Nodular lesions were seen 2 out of 7 chest x-ray and computed tomography images. Cavitating lesion was seen on 1 out of 7 chest x-ray and computed tomography images. Mediastinal enlargement suggesting lymph node was seen 5 out of 7 chest x-ray and computed tomography images. Hyperinflation, bronchial narrowing was seen 2 out of 7 chest x-ray and computed tomography images. Atelectasis, pleural effusion was seen 1 out of 7 chest x-ray and 2 out of 7 computed tomography images. Mediastinal caseating lymph nodes, mediastinal calcific lymph nodes were seen 3 out of 7 computed tomography images. Conclusions: Frequent and the most useful diagnostic radiological findings of pulmonary tuberculosis in infants are mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy with central necrosis and air space consolidations. Disseminated nodules including miliary lesions and airway complications are also detected in this age group. CT can show detailed parenchymal lesions and tuberculous lymphnodes especially calcified ones.",

The ductus bump was first described in 1965 by Berdon et al as a transient physiologic mass in the chest in newborn infants. Some controversy remains as to the exact etiology and clinical significance. Although initially thought to represent a dilated ductus arteriosus, recently it has been suggested that it actually represents a ductus arteriosus aneurysm that spontaneously resolves. Others contend it represents dilation of the infundibulum of the closing ductus. Regardless of etiology, the time of discovery, location, and rapid resolution are characteristic of this entity. In this presentation we will review the radiographic and echocardiogram findings of the ductus bump, as well as discuss the differential diagnosis. The frontal radiographic findings are a round mass to the left of the vertebral spine projecting from the mediastinum near the aortic arch. This mass does not indent the esophagus and it cannot be seen on the lateral view. It is classically said to resolve within the first few days of life. The controversy regarding the etiology has also led to some disagreement involving the clinical significance and appropriate follow up, which will also be discussed. After reviewing this educational poster, the reader will have Conclusions: Abnormalities of the posterior fossa are often difficult to differentiate solely on the basis of their radiologic appearances alone. However, an accurate diagnosis is essential for proper treatment planning and genetic counselling. Therefore it is imperative for radiologists to be well versed with the normal anatomy and development of cerebellum so as to correctly diagnose the various posterior fossa abnormalities.Poster #: SCI-019Imaging of Oculoauriculofrontonasal Syndrome with Low-Dose 3-Dimensional Computed Tomography Paritosh C.

In keeping with the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) concept and the Image Gently recommendations (www.imagegently. org), CT head and face studies were obtained on six of eight patients at SCH, while two had prior exams at outside institutions. Using a 64-slice multidetector CT scanner (GE LightSpeed VCT, Waukesha WI), low-dose CT (120 kV, 150 mAs or lower depending on age) of the head and face was obtained. Planar bone window and 3D surface rendered images were analyzed. Results: Our series of patients demonstrated bifid nasal bones, uni-or bilateral mandibular hypoplasia, temporomandibular and zygomatic dysplasia and bony external auditory canal abnormalities. One patient had an interfrontal bone with a frontal bony defect that was contiguous with the metopic suture. We describe additional previously unidentified CT anomalies of the nasal bones, anterior nasal spine and nasal septum. These structures are involved in all patients who had CT imaging available, although unique features are present in each case. Conclusions: CT is the mainstay of imaging of craniofacial anomalies in the post-natal period, both pre-and postoperatively. In addition to our low-dose CT imaging findings of OAFNS, novel nasal bone anomalies identified by our group serve to identify a new subset of patients with this syndrome and may help refine the phenotype of the OAFNS spectrum.
