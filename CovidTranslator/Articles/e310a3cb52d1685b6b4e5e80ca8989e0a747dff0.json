It has also been established that incorporating either cytokines, biological response modifiers or both into multilamellar vesicles (liposomes) may protect several host species from viruses or tumor metastases in the lung (Hart et ah, 1981; Sone and Fidler, 1981; Key et al., 1982; Koff et al., 1985; Phillips and Chedid, 1987 ). Because of the success of liposome therapy in combating viruses and tumor metastases, we became interested in determining whether this type of therapy might ameliorate respiratory tract infections in pigs. Before attempting such protocols, preliminary experiments were done to gather baseline data on porcine alveolar macrophages. In this manuscript we detail a finding from our initial experiments. We report that 75% of conventionally housed pigs, that appear clinically normal, already have detectable activated alveolar macrophages. These macrophages can not be further activated by the biological response modifier N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine-2H20 (MDP). We suggest that biological response modifier therapy of porcine alveolar macrophages may not be a practical or useful prophylactic technique in alleviating respiratory disease in swine.",

Because young swine develop costly episodes of pneumonia, we were interested in developing a protocol to activate porcine alveolar macrophages with the known biological response modifier MDP. In experiments done to establish baseline information on alveolar macrophages, alveolar macrophages from 12 individ-ual pigs were incubated with several concentrations of MDP for various time intervals. Activation was measured by assessing macrophage cytotoxicity of the tumor cell E8. The data in Table 1 illustrate that macrophages from 75% of the swine tested, were activated before culture in MDP. When freshly harvested porcine macrophages were cultured with tayget cells _+ MDP (for the length of the 18-h cytotoxicity assay), there was no significant difference in the amount of killing between macrophages incubated with or without MDP (See Fig. 1 for two representative animals) . If macrophages were incubated + MDP for 24 or 48 h before target cells were added, alveolar macrophage cytotoxicity diminished to 10 % or less (See Fig. 1 for two representative swine ). Neither 2 nor 20/~g/ml concentrations of MDP maintained macrophage cytotoxic activity better than incubation in culture medium alone. Interestingly, even macrophages that expressed very low levels of cytotoxicity when first harvested, also could not be stimulated to become more cytotoxic (data not shown). These data contrasted the results obtained with murine peritoneal macrophages which were tested simultaneously. The data in Fig. 2 show that freshly harvested murine peritoneal macrophages were not cytolytic in the absence of MDP. These data indicate that our culture conditions were not stimulating the alveolar macrophages to become cytotoxic. Furthermore, macro- phages incubated with target cells in the presence of MDP were cytotoxic for E8. Therefore, our MDP was biologically active. Fig. 2 shows that murine macrophages cultured for 24 h in media without MDP did not become cytotoxic. In contrast, they became cytotoxic when incubated in MDP. Only murine macrophages incubated for 48 h were not cytotoxic, even when incubated in MDP (Fig. 2) .",

The macrophages were not induced to become cytotoxic because of the culture conditions, because murine macrophages cultured identically were not cytotoxic unless incubated with MDP. These data support the findings of Charley et al. (1983a) . They demonstrated that alveolar macrophages from conventionally reared swine were spontaneously cytostatic when tested in vitro. Our findings are also consistent with the studies of E1- Awar and Hahn (1987) that demonstrated about 20% spontaneous killing by alveolar macrophages. Kensinger et al. (1987) found that normal alveolar macrophages had high spontaneous ADCC (antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity) activities against virus-infected cells. However, they did not present data on direct killing of targets in the absence of antibody. In contrast, Rothlein et al. (1981) found that alveolar macrophages from Minnesota miniature swine were not spontaneously cytotoxic. However, their swine were raised under germ-free conditions. This suggests that conventionally raised swine are subjected to environmental conditions that result in activation of alveolar macrophages.",

It is possible that enhancing alveolar macrophage function using biological response modifiers may alter or reverse the suppressive effects of environment or viruses. However, we could not enhance cytotoxicity by normal alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, our treatments did not reverse the loss of cytotoxic activity that occurred when macrophages were cultured in vitro. It is possible that other biological response modifiers may maintain activated, porcine macrophages better than MDP. However, several different biological modifier treatments were unsuccessful in maintaining murine macrophage cytotoxicity in vitro (Chapes and Haskill, 1983 ) .
