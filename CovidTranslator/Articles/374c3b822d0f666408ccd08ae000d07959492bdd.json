            "text": "Influenza virus contains three integral membrane proteins: haemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix protein (M1 and M2). Among them, M2 protein functions as an ion channel, important for virus uncoating in endosomes of virus-infected cells and essential for virus replication. In an effort to explore potential new functions of M2 in the virus life cycle, we used yeast two-hybrid system to search for M2-associated cellular proteins. One of the positive clones was identified as human Hsp40/Hdj1, a DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein. Here, we report that both BM2 (M2 of influenza B virus) and A/M2 (M2 of influenza A virus) interacted with Hsp40 in vitro and in vivo. The region of M2-Hsp40 interaction has been mapped to the CTD1 domain of Hsp40. Hsp40 has been reported to be a regulator of PKR signaling pathway by interacting with p58 IPK that is a cellular inhibitor of PKR. PKR is a crucial component of the host defense response against virus infection. We therefore attempted to understand the relationship among M2, Hsp40 and p58 IPK by further experimentation. The results demonstrated that both A/ M2 and BM2 are able to bind to p58 IPK in vitro and in vivo and enhance PKR autophosphorylation probably via forming a stable complex with Hsp40 and P58 IPK , and consequently induce cell death. These results suggest that influenza virus M2 protein is involved in p58 IPKmediated PKR regulation during influenza virus infection, therefore affecting infected-cell life cycle and virus replication.",

A/M2 has an ion channel activity to permit protons to enter virions and cause RNP-M1 dissociation during uncoating of virions in endosomes (Sugrue and Hay, 1991; Pinto et al., 1992; Takeda et al., 2002) . A/M2 channel activity was required for the activation of inflammasomes by influenza and was sufficient to activate inflammasomes in primed macrophages and dendritic cells (Ichinohe et al., 2010) . A/M2 also functions to equilibrate the pH gradient between the lumen of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the cytoplasm to prevent HA from adopting a low-pH-induced conformation in the Golgi apparatus (Ciampor et al., 1992; Shimbo et al., 1996) . Cytoplasmic tail of the A/M2 plays a vital role in infectious virus production by coordinating the efficient packaging of genome segments into influenza virus particles (McCown and Pekosz, 2006) . Unlike the A/M2 protein, the M2 protein of influenza B virus (BM2) is translated from a bicistronic mRNA derived from RNA segment 7 (Briedis et al., 1982; Horvath et al., 1990) , containing 109 amino acid residues, with a small N-terminal ectodomain (1-7 aa), a single transmembrane domain (8-27 aa) and a Cterminal cytoplasmic tail (28-109 aa) (Pinto and Lamb, 2006) . In addition to its obvious ion channel activity (Mould et al., 2003) , BM2 protein has recently been found to be essential for influenza B virus replication as shown by the experimental data of reverse genetics technology (Hatta et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "There is increasing evidence suggesting that the proteinprotein interactions between virus and host play an important role in the life cycle and pathogenicity of viruses (Liu et al., 2009) . But so far no interacting host partners of influenza virus M2 protein have been identified, except for our recent findings of the host ATPase \u03b21 unit (Mi et al., 2010) . In this study, a yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a human kidney cDNA library so as to identify host proteins that interact with BM2. One clone encoding heat shock protein Hsp40 (Hdj1/ DnajB1/DjB1), a DnaJ/Hsp40 family protein, was identified. We further presented our experimental data to show that both A/M2 and BM2 interacted with Hsp40/Hdj1 in vitro and in vivo. It has been reported that Hsp40 associates with P58 IPK , a cellular inhibitor of PKR, an interferon-induced doublestranded RNA activated serine-threonine kinase (Melville et al., 1997) , which is a novel \"CIHD\" member of the host innate defense response against pathogenic virus. Infection of P58 IPK knockout mice with influenza virus resulted in increased lung pathology, immune cell apoptosis, PKR activation, and mortality (Goodman et al., 2009) . It has been also previously reported that Influenza virus infection promotes the disruption of the Hsp40-P58 IPK complex and the activation of P58 IPK (Katze et al., 1988; Lee and Katze, 1994) . The released P58 IPK is then capable of interacting with PKR by binding to amino acids 244-296, which prevents dimerization and activation of PKR (Tan et al., 1998) . Our results also show that M2 proteins could bind to P58 IPK and be able to promote PKR autophosphorylation and activation in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it is probable that M2 proteins form a stable complex with Hsp40-P58 IPK and hinder the disassociation of Hsp40-P58 IPK . As M2 is synthesized in the late stage of virus infection (Odagiri et al., 1999) , together with the early-synthesized NS1 to inactivate the PKR activity (Bergmann et al., 2000) , influenza virus regulates/ interferes cell functions to facilitate its replication through its protein products (NS1 and M2) interacting with PKR-related proteins.",

One positive clone containing cDNA with entire open reading frame encoding Hsp40/Hdj1 was isolated from a library of approximately 1 \u00d7 10 6 independent clones. To confirm the observed interaction between BM2 and Hsp40 in the yeast, we set up a growth experiment on SD plate lacking adenine, tryptophan, leucine and histidine in the two hybrid system. In this assay, growth on SD medium is supported only when the two hybrid proteins interact and induce transcription from the his reporter gene. We found that two yeast clones co-expressing AD-Hsp40/BD-BM2 and AD-p53/BD-T antigen (positive control) constructs grew on this medium (Fig. 1A) . We also carried out liquid \u03b2-galactosidase assays by co-transforming the recombinant plasmids to yeast strain SFY526. As shown in Fig. 1B , co-transformation of AD-Hsp40 and BD-BM2C resulted in a strong induction of \u03b2-galactosidase activity, significantly higher than that of the respective control co-transformations. These results collectively indicate that BM2 and Hsp40 interact with each other.",

Many viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to evade the host defense, such as production of multifunctional proteins binding to dsRNA or direct interaction with PKR (Morris et al., 2002) . It is reported that A/M2 is highly toxic for mammalian cells, yeast and insect cells (Ilyinskii et al., 2007 (Ilyinskii et al., , 2008 . Similar observations have been made in our experiments. Taken together, our results demonstrate that, during influenza virus infection, M2 protein associating with host partners Hsp40 and P58 IPK leads to the autophosphorylation of PKR, reduction of host proteins synthesis, and finally, induction of cell apoptosis.",

            "text": "It has been thought that the induction of apoptosis is a host defense response, stopping the replication and spread of virus. However, the increasing evidence has shown that apoptosis induction is beneficial for influenza virus replication. First of all, the expression of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 which inhibits influenza virus-induced apoptosis reduces virus replication, spread and HA glycosylation (Olsen et al., 1996) . Furthermore, the inhibition of caspase 3 activity which is a member of the central component of the apoptotic machinery strongly impairs influenza virus propagation (Wurzer et al., 2003) . It seems that influenza virus has acquired the capability to take advantage of the protection machinery of the host cells, thereby supporting viral replication. The virus probably needs some mechanisms to keep the balance between limitation of antiviral response and maintenance of sufficient signaling strength to support virus growth. Such a balance may be controlled by proteins encoded by influenza virus. There are several proteins of influenza virus that has been reported to act as apoptosis promoters: NS1, PB1-F2, NA and M2. But the data that NS1 acts as apoptosis inducer (Schultz-Cherry et al., 2001) was challenged by the finding that recombinant influenza virus lacking NS1 still induced cell apoptosis. It is expressed during the early stage of infection and has been described as an inhibitor of PKR to promote viral protein synthesis. NA was the first influenza virus protein shown to have a role in the induction of apoptosis (Schultz-Cherry and Hinshaw, 1996; Morris et al., 1999) . It can activate TGF-\u03b2 at the cell surface by facilitating cleavage of TGF-\u03b2 into its active form. However, NA is not the sole contributor to apoptosis as UV-irradiated virus, which retains 100% NA activity, weakly induced apoptosis. PB1-F2 is known to localize in the mitochondria of the infected cell and to sensitize cells to death through interactions with two mitochondrial proteins, ANT3 and VDAC1 (Zamarin et al., 2005) . These interactions promote the permeabilization of the mitochondria, facilitate the release of mitochondrial products and trigger cell apoptosis. Like PB1-F2, M2 protein is expressed during the later stages of the infection cycle. This correlates well with late requirement for TRAIL and caspase activity in the viral replication cycle. Their pro-apoptotic effect most likely is not inhibitory to viral replication.",

PKR remains latent in unstimulated cells, and its activation requires binding of specific activators. P58 IPK is also inactive before influenza virus infection because it is bound to Hsp40. Early in the infection, PKR is activated by dsRNA generated by viruses. Moreover, NS1 is expressed and blocks the dsRNA-mediated activation of PKR to fight against host defense and support normal viral replication. P58 IPK is also activated to block the dimerization and activation of PKR due to the disruption of Hsp40-P58 IPK complex. During later stage of the infection, M2 is expressed Protein & Cell and associates with Hsp40 and P58 IPK to prevent the disruption of Hsp40-P58 IPK complex. This leads to the activation of PKR, and then may induce cell apoptosis and control virus replication. Through this sophisticated way, influenza virus manipulates the host cells to favor its replication and release.",

Therefore, we speculate that the interaction of influenza virus M2 protein with Hsp40 possibly results in the dissociation of Hsp40 and P58 IPK and activation of P58 IPK . Unexpectedly, our results from GST pull-down assay showed that purified BM2 protein could not block binding of Hsp40 to P58 IPK . The further observation that both BM2 and A/M2 can bind to P58 IPK suggests that M2 protein, Hsp40 and P58 IPK probably form a stable complex in virus-infected cells. The findings that the level of PKR autophosphorylation was enhanced by both A/M2 and BM2 in vitro and in vivo indicated that P58 IPK was arrested and inactivated as a result of interaction with Hsp40 and M2 protein.Studies using the herpes simplex virus translocating protein VP22 to carry influenza virus proteins into cells have shown that expression of M2 protein induces Hela cell apoptosis",
