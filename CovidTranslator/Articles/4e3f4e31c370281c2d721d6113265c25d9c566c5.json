Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a group of non-enveloped, 49 single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA viruses in the family Astroviridae. 50 HAstVs are causative agents of viral diarrhea in young children, 51 immunocompromised patients, and elderly individuals (1-5). The astrovirus 52 genome has three open reading frames (ORFs); ORF1a and ORF1b encode two 53 nonstructural polyproteins (nsPs), and ORF2 encodes the capsid protein (6). The 54 nsP1a polyprotein, transcribed from ORF1a, is involved in viral transcription 55 and replication. When HAstV infects a host cell, nsP1a is cleaved into at least 56 four products, named nsP1a/1, nsP1a/2, nsP1a/3 (protease), and nsP1a/4. The 57 nsP1a/4 protein is located at the C-terminal end of nsP1a.Several domains have 58 been identified in nsP1a/4, including two coiled-coil regions, a death domain 59 (DD), a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a putative viral genome-linked 60 protein(VPg), and a hypervariable region (HVR)(7-12). It was confirmed that 61 nsP1a/4 plays important roles in the activation of capsid maturation and the 62 regulation of RNA replication (13, 14). To better understand the roles of nsP1a 63 and nsP1a/4 in HAstV infection and replication, we characterized host proteins 64",

We amplified thensP1a gene by PCR and inserted the resulting 92 PCR product (2781bp) by recombination cloning into the yeast two-hybrid 93 (Y2H) bait vector pGBKT7 as a C-terminal fusion with a Gal4 DNA-binding 94 domain (BD). We confirmed the correct constructs by enzyme digestion and 95 DNA sequence analysis (Fig 1A) . When introduced alone into yeast Y2HGold 96 cells, the Gal4 (BD)-nsP1a bait construct wasnot toxic to the yeast and did not 97 auto-activate the Y2H reporter gene, indicating that the construct was suitable 98 for use in a Y2H screen (Fig 1B) . 99 Using a Y2H assay with Gal4 (BD)-nsP1a as bait and a human Caco-2 cDNA 100 prey library, we screened approximately 2.5\u00d710 5 clones and identified 14 101 positive bait-prey interactions.

We analyzed the resulting protein 116 complexes by western blot with anti-Flag or anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3A) . We 117 detected no proteins in control lysates from cells transfected with empty vector 118 (Fig. 3A , lane 1).We detected CD63 protein only in the lysates from cells that 119 wre transfected with pcDNA3.1-3flag-CD63 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) .Likewise, we 120 detectednsP1a protein only in the lysates from cells that were transfected with 121 PEF-HA-nsP1a (Fig. 3A, lane 3) . Both nsP1a and CD63 were readily detected in 122 the lysates from cellsthat were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-3flag-CD63 and 123 PEF-HA-nsP1a. The HA antibody was able to pull down CD63-Flag together 124 with nsP1a-HA (Fig. 3A, lane4) . Likewise, the Flag antibody was able to pull 125 down nsP1a-HA together with CD63-Flag (Fig. 3A, lane4) .
