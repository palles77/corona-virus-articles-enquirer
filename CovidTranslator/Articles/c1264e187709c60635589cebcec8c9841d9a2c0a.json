However, the appearance of novel, drug-resistant or previously recognized viruses in unexpected situations poses a challenge to existing diagnostic approaches. Nucleic acid-based assays have demonstrated their worth as highly sensitive and specific tests for known targets, but they require continuous adaptation. This particularly applies to tests for RNA viruses, which, owing to high error rates in RNA polymerases, are genetically variable. The need for adaptation also applies to real-time PCR tests dependent on probe complementarity to virus sequences.

Leviticus (circa 1440 BCE) provides detailed instructions on the presumptive diagnosis of leprosy [1] . The diagnostic process is explained, based on the shape and color of lesions, the duration of quarantine is specified, re-examination after quarantine is recommended and treatment is described, based on the presumptive diagnosis. Presumptive diagnosis remains crucial for triage. Early, correct deduction can be critical for patient outcome. The WHO estimates up to 100 million dengue infections occur annually with 25,000 fatalities [201] . While there is no specific treatment for dengue, appropriate medical care can save the lives of dengue hemorrhagic fever patients. The ability to rapidly identify the etiological agent and the clinical, immunological and genetic factors that predict disease severity outcome would impact Review Barnard, Hall & Gould significantly on the capacity of the overburdened health facilities to manage the disease. The same argument applies for Australian Bat Lyssavirus, Hendra and Nipah viruses, where purified immunoglobulin [2, 202] or novel engineered antibody therapeutics are now available [3, 4] . In these cases, astute presumptive diagnosis will be critical to facilitate the use of the correct therapeutic antibody or the appropriate public health intervention. Early presumptive diagnosis informs choices between antibacterial, antiviral or antiprotozoal medication; however, this differentiation is difficult, based on circumstances, signs and symptoms (e.g., differentiating between cyclic fever caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, several possible arboviruses or malaria).",

The nucleic acid-based tests developed over the last two decades have been remarkably successful in accelerating our ability to identify etiological agents. However, the conventional approach to assay design has limitations in the context of a changing disease environment. Most nucleic acid-based tests have been designed to detect single organisms or a small panel of organisms chosen on the basis of presumptive diagnosis. Standard target-focused PCRs or ligase chain reactions, even moderately multiplex tests, will fail when the etiological agent is not part of the panel of tests. Usually, uncommon viral infections are common in immunocompromised patients and novel sequence variants appear. The variations may be in regions of the virus targeted by probes or primers. Novel or known viruses emerge in unexpected places or under unforeseen circumstances. Moreover, in the absence of sequence information, the design of primers and/or probes for new tests to detect the new disease is time consuming. By the time a new probe has been added to the suite of target-focused tests, the disease outbreak may have run its course. Indeed, many deaths from viral encephalitis in the UK are not attributed to a specific etiologic agent [5] so there is evidently room for improvement, which presents an opportunity for broadspectrum molecular diagnostics, not narrowly focused on the basis of presumptive diagnosis. Factors in the environment that have the potential to influence the spectrum of viruses to which Homo sapiens is exposed will be summarized in the following section. The potential impact of each factor on target-focused, nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests will be discussed, before the presentation of examples of emerging technological responses.",

Change in vector distribution, for example, the incursions of Aedes albopictus from Torres Strait into northern Australia, are likely to lead to permanent colonization [9] . These mosquitoes have the capacity to spread a suite of viruses (West Nile virus [WNV], yellow fever virus, St. Louis encephalitis, dengue fever and chikungunya virus [CHIKV]) into higher latitudes. Irrespective of whether this change is related to climate change, to the rapid adaptation of mosquitoes to cooler climates or the adaptation of viruses to new vectors [10, 11] , the need for continued adaptation of our diagnostic methods is evident. Extreme climatic events, such as flooding, have an impact on the local disease incidence, and moreover, flooding provides water corridors for the distribution of insect vectors over large distances.",

            "text": "Anthropogenic change of the physical environment has an impact on arbovirus distribution and the frequency of arbovirus-related illnesses. For example, change in water tank usage has been proposed to have had a major effect on the distribution of dengue fever in Australia since the early 20th Century. Russell and colleagues pointed out that, although the current range of Aedes aegypti is restricted to Queensland, the historical distribution was wider and both the vector and virus were formerly distributed all across Australia [12] . A return to previous distribution of dengue could occur as a result of factors other than climate change (e.g., changes in water management or vector-control programs). Irrigation and deforestation have had a major impact Review Nucleic acid-based diagnosis & discovery of emerging viruses on the occurrence of epidemics of Rift Valley fever in Africa. Urbanization in Asia has had an impact on dengue outbreaks. Gould and colleagues have provided a comprehensive review of the range of zoonotic arboviruses in Western Europe [13, 14] . There is strong serological evidence that WNV, Usutu and sindbis virus already circulate in the UK. The authors concluded that climate change is probably the most important requirement for emergence of arthropod-borne diseases such as dengue fever, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis and blue tongue in the UK. However, the unavailability of reservoirs will also be a limiting factor (e.g., the natural reservoir for yellow fever virus [YFV] is tree-dwelling monkeys and their associated mosquitoes). One unexpected consequence of global attempts to control Ae. aegypti appears to have been the progressive displacement of Ae. aegypti by Aedes albopictus (the Asian tiger mosquito). The global spread of Ae. albopictus has also been facilitated by tyre shipments. Ae. albopictus is now established in most tropical, subtropical and temperate regions [15, 16] . As Ae. albopictus continues to spread, the distribution of dengue, chikungunya and other viruses will change. New diagnostic tests need to anticipate this development.",

WNV has been isolated from more than 60 mosquito species in North America, and WNV, YFV and St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) have also been isolated from ticks, which is indicative of vector promiscuity [18] . CHIKV appears to have acquired an A226V mutation in the E1 envelope, which improves its transmission competence for Ae. albopictus. This adaptation is postulated to have facilitated the 2007 epidemic in northern Italy, and may have facilitated the outbreak in La Reunion. Ae. aegypti has long been considered to be the natural and most effective vector of CHIKV for humans, but this mosquito species has not yet become established as a significant vector of CHIKV, either in Italy or La Reunion [8] . Ae. albopictus has gradually been dispersing worldwide and is present and active in Italy and La Reunion, but was not considered to be an effective vector of CHIKV until the virus mutated in the E1 protein (A226V). This improved the vector competence of Ae. albopictus for CHIKV. The A226V mutation appears to have arisen on several independent occasions in CHIKV from different geographic regions, implying convergent evolution, presumably under the selective pressure of the tiger mosquito. De Lamballerie et al. describe three distinct examples of convergent evolution that were identified during an approximate period between 2005 and 2007 [19] . These were identified in the regions of La Reunion/Mauritius/Madagascar, India (this covers the Italian virus which was introduced from India), and Cameroon and Gabon. Populations of Ae. albopictus in Florida (USA) are able to transmit CHIKV [20] , thus diagnostic test panels should be expanded to include this pathogen and facilitate its differentiation from other related alphaviruses circulating in the Americas. Moreover, rapid and precise diagnosis would increase the likelihood of identifying the associated vector species. It would be advantageous if these new diagnostic tests could incorporate detection of the A226V mutation as a predictor of the relative ease of transmission in regions outside the range of Ae. aegypti.",

There has been a contemporaneous emergence of several zoonotic viruses in the last two decades. The transmission of viruses to humans has been facilitated by bidirectional habitat encroachment and increasing frequencies of contact between bats and humans, sometimes involving an intermediate domestic animal host (e.g., pigs in the case of Nipah virus, horses in the case of Hendra virus and civets in the case of SARS). Satellite telemetry has demonstrated that bats travel long distances (e.g., between Australia and Papua New Guinea [25] ). Birds play a role in the dispersal of arboviruses such as sindbis virus, SLEV, WNV and Usutu virus (USUV) [13] .

Regular transmission from primates to humans suggests that viral adaptation to new hosts plays an important role in cross-species transmission and large-scale emergence in humans.

RNA viruses, including retroviruses, have much higher mutation rates than DNA viruses [33, 34] , increasing the complexity of generating effective probes for nucleic acid amplification tests. This can result in assay 'drop out'. This has been a problem with influenza A diagnostics targeting hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments. It is exemplified by the necessity for ad hoc test development for the 2009 H1N1 human influenza of swine origin, the 'swine influenza virus real-time detection panel', and its authorization for emergency use by the US FDA. This test was subsequently replaced by an improved version developed by the CDC, as more H1N1 specimens became available [203] . The problem of drop out continues to plague commercial and in-house assays [35] . Whiley and colleagues cite several examples of PCR or reversetranscriptase (RT)-PCR-based virus diagnostic assays that are prone to false-negative results caused by sequence variation. This list includes commercial assays for HIV-1, human parvovirus B19, and in-house methods for rabies and cytomegalovirus [35] . This calls for astute primer design or the use of multiple gene targets within a single organism (e.g., combining PCRs for the por A and ctr A genes in Neisseria meningitidis [36] or for the HA and NA genes for influenza A detection) [37] . The challenge to the designer of an influenza diagnostic test is the same as the challenge faced by the designer of influenza vaccines, where the vaccine needs to be reformulated annually to account for antigenic drift and also when antigenic shift is detected.",

WNV outbreaks have been recorded in birds, horses and humans in Europe and Russia since the 1960s. The most recent recorded outbreak in Italy was reported in 2008/2009 [38] . For many years, CHIKV was regarded as an African virus that caused occasional localized outbreaks in human communities closely associated with the forest regions where the virus circulates among Aedes spp. Prior to 2005, the virus was also spasmodically associated with outbreaks of chikungunya fever in India. In 2005, the virus appeared for the first time in La R\u00e9union and the Comoros Islands and quickly became established as both epidemic and endemic. Subsequently, it dispersed to India and many other parts of Malaysia where epidemics are now common and involve millions of humans annually. For the first time, this virus also recently caused epidemics in Italy. Thus, CHIKV is now endemic/epidemic in the southern Oceans and Asia and appears to be moving into southern Europe [49, 50] . USUV was detected for the first time in Vienna in 2001, where it caused fatal encephalitis in wild birds. This virus has now been detected in several southern European countries and in 2009 was identified as the etiological agent for a case of human neuroinvasive disease [51] . Bluetongue virus (BTV) is now endemic in southern Europe and arrived for the first time in northern Europe in 2006. Indeed, BTV crossed the English Channel and caused outbreaks in the UK in 2008 before it was controlled using a combination of quarantine, controlled importation measures and vaccine usage. At the time of writing, BTV has not reappeared in the UK. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has recently occurred for the first time in southern Europe. Rift Valley fever has, on two occasions, moved out of Africa into the Arabian Peninsula. Since the discovery of Hendra virus in Australia in 1994, and Nipah virus in 1998, there have been 199 cases of hemorrhagic fever due to one or other of Review Nucleic acid-based diagnosis & discovery of emerging viruses these viruses [204] . In South America, dengue virus has expanded its range to Argentina. In September 2010, two independent cases of autochthonous transmission of dengue fever and two of chikungunya fever occurred in south-eastern France [52] . Clearly, these events have implications for Europe and consequently for innovative and rapid design of nucleic acid-based virus diagnostics.",

            "text": "Real-time PCR has rapidly become the favored method of choice in clinical virology laboratories. It is routinely used in targetfocused tests for many viruses, including HIV-1 [53] , parvovirus [54] , BTV [55] , WNV [56] , dengue virus [57] , influenza A virus, influenza B virus and at least eight human herpes viruses. Multiplexing is utilized in some of these tests, both to enable coamplification of internal and external controls along with the target viral nucleic acid (e.g., [55] ), as well as for reasons of economy and work flow, to include several of the detectable targets in one or two reaction tubes. The level of multiplexing can be increased by various strategies. One method (utilized in [28] ) entails dividing the extracted nucleic acid samples into more than one tube and using sequential real-time reactions after the positive reaction is identified by melt-curve ana lysis in one of the tubes. By this means it has proved possible to detect and differentiate HSV1, HSV2, VZV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, human herpes virus (HHV)6, HHV7 and HHV8. As mentioned earlier, some of the rarer, yet highly pathogenic, herpes viruses (e.g., herpes simiae virus) are not included in these panels. As many of these multiplex real-time PCR assays are dependent on multiple, exact-match primers directed to single target genes, they are vulnerable to sequence variation and 'drop-out of signal'. Another strategy to increase the level of multiplexing is to utilize GC-rich extensions on the tails of PCR primers, allowing discrimination of amplified targets by melt-curve ana lysis. Lo et al. used this approach, combined with the use of two fluorophores and the intercalating dye SYBR \u00ae Green [57] . Using this hybrid strategy, the authors were able to detect and differentiate dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. However, the assay was not designed to detect JEV, which cocirculates with dengue in many locations in Asia.",

Various arboviruses cocirculate in geographically overlapping regions, with incursions of exotic flaviviruses into unanticipated regions becoming more common (see later), posing a difficult challenge for diagnostics. The pan-genus diagnostic approach has been utilized for three decades in antibody-based assays, with panflavivirus monoclonal antibodies developed in the early 1980s [63] . Follow-up immunological tests were necessary for species identification but these are not always definitive (see later for the example of the failure of West Nile differentiation from USUV by immunological methods).

Sequence alignments of 490 flavivirus sequences were used to select highly conserved sites in all known members of the genus. A computer program capturing the method of Zheng et al. [68] was then used to chart the sequence stability in the selected, conserved flavivirus sites over the time period since the first flavivirus was entered into the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. This program (dubbed 'Lu-Tze') identifies the least rapidly changing sequences among the initially selected group of conserved sites. A region in the NS5 gene was selected and redundant (mixed-base) primers were designed [66] , amplifying a product rich in phylogenetic information and suitable for downstream analysis using array technology (see later). This assay was effective in detecting all 66 tested flaviviruses from all three groups: mosquito-borne, tick-borne and no known vector, as well as some recently isolated variant viruses (i.e., a variant Edge Hill Virus, a member of the YFV group) [69] .",

            "text": "The RT-PCR was interfaced with a prototype array detection system that utilized a novel probe design [65] . These 'dichot' or 'binary' probes successively divide a target population of sequences into two populations [70] : those that react with the probe and those that do not (Figure 1 ). As each probe generates a yes/no (binary) answer, they can be described in terms of a base 2 logarithm, such that Y = 2 X , where X is the number of probes and Y is the maximum number of species that can be differentiated. For example, ten probes differentiate 2 10 = 1024 species and 20 probes differentiate >1 million. This system generates a binary barcode. The discovery of a new nonzero barcode flags a new but related virus. For example, if one compares the binary barcodes of two viruses on a dichot array consisting of nine spots, 100100100 and 100100101, these different codes can be interpreted as revealing three regions of similarity and one region of nonsimilarity between two viruses. This type of array detection yields an immediately expandable test. Newly discovered viruses will be those generating a new barcode on the existing array. The new barcode can be entered into a pattern-matching database and a new test is rapidly available. This and other array-based, nontarget-focused detection methods are examples of adaptive Moureau et al. also developed a one-step RT-PCR method for universal (more correctly, pan-genus) detection of flaviviruses [65] . The primers (PF1S/PF2R) were a modification of degenerate primers described earlier [72] [73] [74] . Their assay was extended to develop a real-time RT-PCR version of the test, using the SYBR green system. The real-time assay, when positive, was followed by direct sequencing using the amplification primers. This test exhibited exquisite sensitivity and, notably, was capable of detecting cell fusing agent virus in mosquito pools and Ngoye virus from crushed ticks.",

These signatures are located in the HA gene segment, the PB2 gene segment, the NA gene segment and the M gene segment. Although the association between signature and phenotype is well established, the signatures have not yet been utilized in front-line diagnostic tests, which currently give little more than rudimentary information about the HA and NA type. In response to this need, Castillo Alvarez et al. developed a degenerate primer, single-step, touch-down RT-PCR to detect all NA subtypes, amplifying the region of the NA gene segment containing the molecular signature (H275Y) encoding oseltamivir resistance, and the PB2 segment from all influenza subtypes containing molecular signatures for pathogenicity [77, 78] . A second weakness of current front-line Review Barnard, Hall & Gould diagnostic tests is that most of the commercial and in-house assays target a limited range of HA and NA types. Moreover, they are prone to drop out due to sequence variation in primer and probe regions [35] . In response to this problem, a more robust, albeit target-focused, real-time RT-PCR was developed to detect H1N1 of swine origin. It was improved by using RT-PCR to amplify two gene segments, the HA and NA genes [37] . This assay detected the first case of novel H1N1 influenza in Australia.",

A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was obtained from a child with pneumonia. A total of 17 targetfocused PCR assays for known respiratory viruses produced negative results. Total nucleic acid from the NPA was randomly amplified using the sequential, random primed 'AB' protocol of Wang et al. [71] . The primer B products were cloned and 384 clones were sequenced using standard dye terminator chemistry. The strategy resulted in 327 human sequences, six known bacterial sequences and six viral sequences, all with limited homology (34-50% predicted amino acid identity) to known polyoma viruses. This led to the discovery of a novel polyoma virus. Specific primers were then designed and prevalence studies undertaken on 1254 respiratory samples, revealing a 3% prevalence. Finkbeiner et al. used the same approach, including the random primed 'AB' amplification method, followed by cloning and sequencing to identify a spectrum of known and novel viruses from human diarrhea, including highly divergent astrovirus and, unexpectedly, sequences from nodaviruses not hitherto associated with infection in mammals [84] .",

However, the number of detectable simultaneous targets has been broadened by intelligent primer design, such as the use of 'tails' on PCR products to allow differentiation by size or melting curve [55] and splitting samples into multiple reactions. A second and pervasive restriction which is a limitation of any target-focused amplification or hybridization nucleic acid test, is the possibility of drop out when the target sequence evolves and novel variants emerge. This continues to plague commercial and in-house assays [35] and necessitates astute primer design or the use of multiple gene targets within a single organism [36, 37] . In the emerging disease environment, those within target multiplexing will need to be more generally adopted. Thus, the pressure for increased multiplexing as a result of two requirements: first, the need to increase the number of gene targets within a single virus, and second, PCR tube Unichip Figure 2 . Nanowire chip in PCR tube. Electronic 'drop-intube' biochip. The chip could include oligonucleotide-coated nanowires at the lower end of the chip (yellow section), each of which is connected to a discrete radiofrequency identification transponder (red section) [102] . The process by which nucleic acids are coated on the nanowires, and the distance between the wire surface and the hybridization event, will be critical (see [99, 100] ) to allow this type of device to operate at the ionic strengths encountered in PCR reactions.
