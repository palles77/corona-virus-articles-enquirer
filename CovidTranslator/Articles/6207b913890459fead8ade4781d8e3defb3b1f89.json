Unfortunately, many patients are inherently resistant or develop resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PIs). One potential strategy to combat PI resistance is targeting upstream components of the UPS such as DUBs. DUBs represent a promising potential therapeutic target due to their critical roles in various cellular processes including protein-turnover, localization and cellular homeostasis. While considerable efforts have been undertaken to develop DUB modulators, significant advancement is necessary move DUB inhibitors into the clinic.",

There are approximately 600 ubiquitin E3 ligases identified, with variable specificities to individual protein-substrates [2] . Once a protein is polyubiquitinated by an E3 Ligases it is designated for degradation under unmodified UPS conditions, and is transported to the multimeric 26S proteasome complex which cleaves it into oligopeptides and releases the ubiquitin moieties which are recycled by the UPS [1] [2] . The 26S proteasome consists of a complex of a 20S core particle consisting of heteromeric \u03b2-subunits that possess a protease-like activity, and is capped by two 19S regulatory particles on each end of the 20S core [1] [3] .

This has led to extensive interest in the molecular machinery that regulates the UPS and modulation of protein-ubiquitination states [10, 11] . The fate of ubiquitinated proteins is determined by: the number of ubiquitin residues (ub-chains), the position of conjugations, and the specific branching patterns of poly-ubiquitin chains [12] . Protein ubiquitination (Ub) is a reversible mechanism (deubiquitination) regulated by DUBs, which has emerged as a cardinal regulatory-target for posttranslational modifications [1] [2] which, like protein phosphorylation, adds to the complexity and sensitivity of the UPS. The complex nature of UPS modulation allows the cell to finely tune its response to different physiological states and stimuli by modulating the fate of key molecules in the cells' molecular-machinery/systems, and biological-pathways. Ubiquitination status is now recognized as a key posttranslational modification that plays a plethora of critical roles in protein turnover as well as variety of signal transduction pathways [2] . regulate the degradation, and consequently the expression and activity of plethora of critical molecular targets and as a result, DUBs regulate diverse cellular processes and functions ( Figure 1 ) including [15] processing or removal of polyubiquitin moieties or chains on proteins, thereby altering the targeted protein's fate with regards to either degradation by proteasome and/or differential subcellular localization [15, 16] . In addition, DUBs regulate gene expression, apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA repair as well as cytokine signaling [17] which will be further discussed in 'DUBs in other diseases' section. ",

Thus DUBs and E3 Ligases regulate protein fate in a similar way that kinases and phosphatases regulate protein activity [19, 20] . However, the complexities of the UPS far exceed the kinase/phosphatase dynamic. As mentioned previously ubiquitin chains of different length and/or branching patterns can modulate the localization of degradation of the ubiquitinated proteins [5, 21] . Therefore, specific cleavage along the ubiquitin chain in different locations can have differential effects on the fate of the ubiquitinated protein, which provides the cells with a complex and dynamic system to modulate protein turnover, activity, expression and localization [19, 22] .",

            "text": "There is substantial scientific evidence demonstrating that DUBs exhibit strong substrate selectivity including protein specificity and specificity for specific branching patters of motifs of poly-ubiquitin chains. The key domain of DUBs is their ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) [13] . The UBD consists of: A ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), a zinc finger ubiquitin-specific protease domain (ZnF-UBP domain), and a ubiquitinassociated domain (UBA domain) [25] . Most research indicates that the ZnF-UBP imparts the ability of the DUBs to specifically target individual proteins and/or structural-motifs, thereby imparting target specificity for the individual DUBs [13] . It has been hypothesized that almost 95 DUBs are encoded by the human genome [26, 27] . DUBs can be subdivided into five subfamilies that consist of four cysteine proteases: Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), Ovarion tumour proteases (OTUs), Machado-Joseph domain proteases (MJD), and a zinc metallo-iso-peptidase and the Herpes virus tegument USPs (e.g. JAB1/MPN/MOV34 metalloproteases/JAMM) [27] [28] [29] . In addition, M48 USP , a novel class of proteases that function as a DUBs but are not in the same gene family, has also been reported [13] . This suggests that there may be other gene families that act on the UPS to modulate protein ubiquitination status, which should be considered when designing/developing DUB inhibitors and targeted therapies [30] . Among the DUBs, three DUBs are associated with 19S regulatory particle (RP) in humans [31] [30, 32] , including Rpn11, Usp14/Ubp6 and Uch37/UchL5.",

Inhibition of the proteasome by bortezomib was the first clinical validation of targeting the UPS in cancer therapeutics [6] [ [33] [34] [35] . However, soon it was observed that extended treatments with bortezomib were associated with toxicities and drug resistance, limiting its efficacy [36] . Furthermore, PIs have failed to show efficacy in solid tumors in humans [37] . Researchers now propose that targeting specific aspects of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway upstream of the 20S proteasome (e.g. DUBs) might be advantageous with regards to efficacy as well as adverse effects [38] . The aspect of DUB activity that makes them an attractive therapeutic target for cancer and other diseases is the ability to modulate protein fate in a specific or selective manner/fashion [2] [5] . Therefore, targeting this pathway can modulate the signaling status of the cell by modifying specific \"Key Aspects\" of the pathological pathways to specifically direct the cell towards death or recovering from the pathological state. For example, a DUB that targets a tumor suppressor protein may be a good target for activation in order to increase the expression of the tumor suppressor by decreasing UPS degradation, alternatively the targeting of a DUB may change the localization of a protein and serve to inhibit oncogenic processes. Conversely, DUBs that target oncogenic proteins may be targeted by compounds to inhibit their activity through degradation by UPS. Development and design of an enzyme selective/specific inhibitor is easier than designing and developing an enzyme activator (due to competitive inhibition and modeling of substrates). Therefore researchers emphasize greater efforts towards the development of DUB inhibitors [2] [5] . However, it is important to emphasize the benefits of studying the basic science modulating this complex system in order to determine the intrinsic mechanisms that enhance selective DUB activity endogenously and then we could potentially highjack/utilize these process/ properties to design therapies around nature's stratagem.",

Screening for genetic abnormalities in ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro as well as the 3T3 focus formation assays point to the role of USP14 in ovarian carcinogenesis [41] . Another study in colorectal cancer patients found that upregulated USP14 expression levels are associated with the pathologic stages as well as liver and lymph node metastases [41] [42] [43] . CXCR4 degradation and chemotaxis is controlled due to its deubiquitination by USP14 [44] .

Although the limiting factor of their work is the lack of the specificity of identified inhibitors, other researchers have shown that selective inhibition of specific DUBs is possible [58] . Figure 3A ) is a novel proteasome-inhibitory agent that acts by abrogating the DUB activity associated with the 19S RP [61] . It selectively inhibits the activity of two DUBs, UCHL5 and USP14 that are associated with 19S RP while not affecting the non-proteasomal DUBs. The inventors propose that b-AP15 may be effective in treating cancer subtypes that are resistant to bortezomib or other PIs. Furthermore, their research shows that compound b-AP15 may be effective in the treatment of other anti-cancer agent refractory cancers [62] .",

Interestingly, p53 status of the cancer cells or overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, BAX and PUMA did not affect the induction of apoptosis by b-AP15 [63] . Therefore, b-AP15 MOA differs from bortezomib [48, 64] . b-AP15 also decreases viability in MM cell lines as well as MM cells obtained from patients, even in the presence of bone marrow stroma cells [48] . Importantly, under in vitro conditions b-AP15 has been shown to overcome the bortezomib resistance. b-AP15 treatment to MM cells arrested their growth due to the down regulation of CDC25C, CDC2 and cyclin B1 with the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis and activation of unfolded protein response. b-AP15 is well tolerated in in-vivo studies using human MM xenograft models which is associated with inhibition of tumor growth as well as prolonged survival [48] . The combination of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, lenalidomide, or dexamethasone with b-AP15 showed synergistic anti-MM activity. b-AP15 induced apoptosis is not dependent on TP53 status or BCL2 expression in cancer cells. This preclinical data demonstrates the efficacy of b-AP15 in MM disease models and validates DUBs as potential therapeutic targets, providing a basis for future clinical studies on USP14/UCHL5 inhibitors in patients resistant to PIs [48] .",

This is exemplified in the high incidence of tumors such as renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and hemingioblastoma of the central nervous system in individuals with loss of function of both alleles of the VHL gene leading to elevated HIF-1\u03b1 levels [70] . In addition, most cases of sporadic renal cell carcinoma are associated with early loss of function of the HVL gene and increased HIF-1\u03b1 levels. HIF-1\u03b1 levels are also increased in cancer cells with mutant or deleted PTEN [71, 72] . HIF-1\u03b1 was therefore described as an important target for anticancer drug development because of the role it plays in regulating the response of growing tumors to hypoxia and PX-478 as an agent that would be effective against such tumors by being selectively activated in hypoxic environments [65] .",

HAUSP is most widely known as a direct antagonist of MDM2 [94] . Normally, p53 levels are kept low in part due to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Interestingly, in response to oncogenic insults, HAUSP can deubiquitinate p53 and protect p53 from MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 in response to stress. It was also reported, however, that HAUSP is required for p53 destabilization and disruption of HAUSP stabilizes p53 [94] .

Similarly, diethyldithiocarbamate (EtDTC) when coupled with copper and zinc could inhibit purified 20S proteasome and intact 26S proteasomal activities in the cancer cells. Interestingly, zincand copper-(EtDTC) 2 complexes were better inhibitors of 26S proteasome than 20S proteasome [95, 98, 101] . Hence, it has been proposed that the copper or zinc complex act as proteasome inhibitors although their mechanism might be different from clinically approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. It is possible that these complexes could inhibit the 19S rather than the 20S proteasome, although this needs to be further assessed [95, 98] .",

Therefore, it was recently approved for Phase II clinical trial to treat cancer by US Food and Drug Administration (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01419691). Although, the exact mechanism of action for Aur is not clear, quantitatively it is equally effective as bortezomib in terms of proteasome inhibitory properties but mechanistically it differs from bortezomib as it inhibits proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (DUBs) like UCHL5 and USP14 but not the 20S proteasome [102] . Additionally, UCHL5 and USP14 inhibition is required for its cytotoxic effects. There are several reports that indicated that it has other targets as it showed inhibition of DNA, RNA, protein synthesis as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, and cathepsin B. Furthermore, in vivo in animal models, Aur showed inhibition of tumor growth.

The UPS consists of a profound and dynamic regulatory system that controls the fate of specific proteins thereby coordinating the dynamic signaling status and fates of the cells. DUBs play a prominent and specific role in regulation of the UPS and therefore are plausible therapeutic targets. DUBs regulate the ubiquitination state of many crucial molecules and thereby regulate cellular pathways modulating homeostasis and fate. Crystal structures of various DUBs have been resolved which provide additional evidence that DUB inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of proteopathies, viral infections, as well as cancer. Although progress has been made in our understanding of DUB biology/mechanisms, there is considerable work to be done in order to move DUBs into the clinic. Basic research is crucial to discovering the natural regulatory mechanism in a cell in order to identify candidate pathways and targets which are required for regulation of DUB expression and activity that may be modulated pharmacologically. Furthermore, basic science is yet to fully understand system wide pharmacodynamic ramifications of targeting of DUBS. Rigorous, well-controlled studies must be performed in order to fully understand the specificity, selectivity, activity and stability of the various endogenous DUBs in normal and pathological biology in order to determine the best targets for future DUB-based drug developments.",

These studies have revealed a high prevalence of inherent and induced direct PI resistance in patients, in addition to a lack of efficacy in the treatment of solid tumors, as well as multiple adverse effects. As a result additional approaches for targeting the proteasome and/or the components of the proteasome system must be pursued.",

This review has also viewed the considerable efforts that have been undertaken in order to develop novel DUB modulators; however, it is clear that further understanding in the basic biology and specificity/selectivity of DUBs is needed before specific DUB inhibitors can be identified and developed for the clinic.",

With the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance bacteria and microorganism DUBs may be utilized as novel and specific anti-biotics if DUB inhibitors could be developed to specifically target the pathogenic DUBs sparing any untoward effects in the host.

Unfortunately, the majority of current small molecule DUBs inhibitors are not selective and target multiple DUBs, although it is yet to be proved if compounds that target only one specific DUB could be clinically useful. It is very likely that resistance might quickly become a problem once again even to these selective and specific inhibitors. However, it is possible that DUB inhibitors that intentionally lack specificity might be more beneficial therapeutically by targeting multiple critical proteins in the same or multiple pathologic pathways.
