Having reviewed records of important events in the years where drops were noticed, outbreaks of serious infectious diseases were found in Hong Kong. The following events were the epidemics in Hong Kong which are characterized by the time series in the lower panel of Fig. 2 (HKTA , 1999; HKTB, 2005) .

Using the case of SARS, Chien and Law (2003) have advocated that hotel managers should be well prepared for unexpected epidemics. By mastering the influencing factor of infectious diseases, the impact on hotel occupancy rate and its lasting time can be accessed for the potential occurrence of future epidemics. The recent outbreak of Influenza A has already had a very negative impact on the hotel industry in Hong Kong and many other regions. By analyzing the existing and expected infectious cases as well as the fatality rate, one can quantitatively estimate the extent of influence of the disease on hotel occupancy rates and the induced financial loss by comparing the previous outbreaks such as avian flu and SARS.",

Therefore, at an operational level, hotel managers should take actions to minimize operation costs during a crisis. Some feasible choices could be shutting down unnecessary equipment, reducing consumption of electricity and water, as well as stop using some high-cost but under-utilized facilities. With the temporally decrease of tourists due to the threat of diseases, hotels could consider flexibly changing their marketing strategies by attracting local residents for dining and lodging to raise both hotel revenues and occupancy rates. Lastly, the model has an influence on decision-making of hotel development projects as a popular district will have a higher risk of experiencing larger drops in occupancy rates during an outbreak of influential diseases. This should be taken into account during hotel development.",

With the time series data of Hong Kong hotel occupancy rates, an infectious disease influencing factor was identified that can capture the acute influence of bird influenza and SARS on hotel occupancy rates. With the availability of additional data, the model can be extended to access the likely impact of other infectious diseases on a region's hotel industry. To summarize, the successful implementation of the model would be beneficial to hotel managers on planning for potential crises.",
