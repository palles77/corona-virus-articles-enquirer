Diverse RNA species interact with RNA, DNA, proteins, lipids, and metabolites to form intricate molecular networks. In this review, we attempt to delineate diverse RNA functions by interaction types between RNA and other macromolecules. Through such interactions RNAs participate in essentially every major molecular function and process, including information flow and storage, environment sensing, signal transduction, and gene regulation at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Through such interactions, RNAs promote or inhibit diverse biological processes, and act as catalyzer or quencher to modulate the pace of these progresses. Alterations and personal variations of these interactions are mechanistically coupled with disease etiology and phenotypical variations for clinical use.",

            "text": "RNAs are diverse and have refined roles. Besides canonical protein-encoding RNAs, various long and short ncR-NAs have been continuously discovered with advances in the experimental and computational approaches of contemporary biology. We propose to classify RNAs with (partially) characterized functionalities into three categories ( Table 1 ). The first class encompasses protein-coding associated RNAs including RNAs designated to protein synthesis, i.e., messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and RNAs responsible for their maturation. While mRNAs, rRNAs and tRNAs are responsible for protein translation; small nuclear RNAs (snRNA) primarily function in pre-mRNA processing in the nucleus, ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) are responsible for tRNA and rRNA maturation, respectively, and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA) possess impressively diverse functions including rRNA and snRNA modification. The second class of RNAs comprises of regulatory RNAs. For example, micro RNAs (miRNAs), short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNA) are short ncRNAs interfering with gene expression via degrading mRNA molecules posttranscriptionally; piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence retrotransposons and other genetic elements in germline cells; antisense RNAs (aRNAs) are endogenous RNAs with partial or full sequence complementarity to other transcripts, which use diverse transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms to carry out a wide variety of biological functions; competing endogenous RNAs (ceR-NAs) regulate mRNA transcripts by competing for shared miRNAs; long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are over 200 nucleotides in length and transcribed in a tissue specific and developmentally regulated pattern that can mediate epigenetic alterations via recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes to specific genomic loci; enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are short ncRNA molecules transcribed from the enhancer regions and actively play a role in transcriptional regulation in cis and in trans [4] . The last group is comprised of parasitic RNAs including, e.g., retrotransposons capable of self-propagation, RNA viruses, and CRISPR RNAs (crR-NAs) that constitute prokaryotic immune system by helping Cas proteins recognize and cut exogenous DNA. Such a classification is not mutually exclusive. Some RNAs were identified initially from one class and later found with roles played in another. For example, circular RNAs (circRNAs) [5] were firstly characterized as ncRNAs with gene regulatory potential [6] , some of which were shown later with protein-coding roles [7] . The precise roles of many ncR-NAs are still under investigation. For instance, sno-derived RNAs (sdRNAs) are miRNA-like RNAs originated from H/ ACA box snoRNAs or C/D box snoRNAs with hypothetical roles during the interplay between RNA silencing and snoRNA-mediated RNA processing systems; miRNA-offset RNAs (moRNAs) are produced from human miRNA precursors but have considerably lower expression levels than the corresponding miRNAs; transcription initiation RNAs (tiRNAs) are mapped within \u2212 60 to + 120 nucleotides of the transcription start site (TSS) and suggested as a general feature of transcription in possibly all eukaryotes with exact functions uncharacterized. The diverse types of RNA functionalities largely depend on their interactions with macromolecules, which are often determined by the sequence and structural features of both interplay partners. This review classifies currently identified RNA interactions into six categories depending on their interplay partners, outlines the capturing technologies in each category as well as the derived RNA functionalities, and identifies understudied niches as future directions to warrant more investigations.",

            "text": "RNA-DNA interactions possess prominent functionalities in diverse biological processes through genetic and epigenetic regulations. NcRNAs are key regulators of chromatin states and gene expression for important biological processes such as dosage compensation [8] , imprinting [9] , development process [10] , lineage differentiation, and disease progression including cancinogenesis [11] , where DNA-RNA hybrid formation plays an important role. RNAs provide the templates to orchestrate genome rearrangement in some species such as Oxytricha and act as the templates to facilitate DNA translocation in the 'trans-splicing mediation' model of non-canonical gene fusions resulted from intergenic splicing [12] . Further, the activity of the telomerase holoenzyme is determined by the binding affinity between the telomerase RNA template region and the DNA primer [13] ; the CRISPR Transcription initiation RNA tiRNA Mapped within \u2212 60 to + 120 nucleotides of the transcription start site (TSS) and suggested as a general feature of transcription in possibly all eukaryotes with exact functions uncharacterized system against foreign nucleic acid invasion in bacteria and archaea involves DNA/RNA hybrids; steady-state circRNAs have been mapped to thousands of genomic loci in mammals and contribute to gene regulation [6] ; and transcriptional pausing can be modeled using sequence-dependent free energy of nucleic acid interactions including DNA-RNA base pairing. While some lncRNAs work in cis on neighboring genes, others function in trans to regulate distantly located genes. For example, while both playing fundamental roles in X chromosome inactivation and dose compensation, human lncRNA Xist functions in cis [8] and Drosophila ncRNAs roX1 and roX2 bind numerous regions in trans on the X chromosome of male cells. Most evidence on the interactions between RNA and DNA was observed at the chromatin level. We extract RNA-DNA interaction modes from this context and summarize them into 4 types. We define 'type 1' as 'RNA interaction with single DNA strand forming R loop', 'type 2' as 'RNA interaction with double DNA strand forming triple helix', 'type 3' as 'RNA interaction with single DNA strand without R loop', and 'type 4' as 'RNA interaction with double DNA strand forming tertiary structure'. Type 1 is the mode used for mRNA elongation in the transcription machinery, where the R loop comprises the nascent RNA hybridized with the DNA template strand and the singlestranded non-template DNA [14] . Recent advances have confirmed the role of type 1 mode RNA-DNA interaction in regulating ncRNA expression. For instance, R loops are formed over the promoter region of the lncRNA COOLAIR and stabilized by AtNDX (a ssDNA-binding homeodomain protein) to suppress its transcription [15] . The sgRNAs in the CRISPR system function via the type 1 mode for genomeediting, representing an exogenous example (Fig. 2a) . The type 2 mode is adopted by many lncRNAs to regulate gene expression in cis or in trans [16] . For instance, promoterassociated RNAs (pRNAs) regulate rRNA gene expression by forming stable RNA-DNA triple helix with the promoter sequence, and the formed triplex is specifically recognized by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3b that results in de novo CpG methylation of rRNA genes (Fig. 2b) . It is also reported that specific endogenous miRNAs take the type 2 mode to fight against viral invasion in eukaryotic cells by entangling with double strand DNA viruses such as HIV-1 and forming stable triplexes with viral DNA motifs [17] . The RNA template of telomerase takes the type 3 mode to interact with single DNA strand for chromosome elongation (Fig. 2c) . The type 4 mode is a potential model recently proposed where RNA serves as a structural component to maintain the 3D genome conformation (Fig. 2d) .",

Another fundamental landmark awarded with Nobel Prize is the regulatory roles of RNAs on gene expression derived from siRNA-mRNA interactions, which has led to technical advances in gene expression modulation, namely RNA interference. RNA-RNA interactions represent a general strategy used by many ncRNAs to achieve complicated and diverse biological functionalities. For example, genomewide RNA interactome analysis revealed that TINCR (terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA) interacts with a range of differentiation mRNAs through a 25-nucleotide 'TINCR box' motif, and is required for their high mRNA abundance.",

The formation of structured RNA such as duplexes represents a critical feature of RNA mediated biological processes. The lead RNA can take diverse roles when interacting with its RNA partner such as enzyme (e.g., ribozyme in mRNA degradation), sponge (e.g., cir-cRNA in miRNA regulation), schaffold (e.g., lncRNA during nascent RNA production), and guider (e.g., snoRNA in rRNA maturation) (Fig. 3) . Besides locally positioned RNA structures, long-distance intragenomic RNA-RNA interactions also exist.",

Detection of long-range and other tertiary RNA interactions has been achieved by structure-based approaches including nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscropy [22] . RNA proximity ligation following immunoprecipitation of complexes of interest given a known interacting protein partner has been launched with success for mapping several types of RNA interactions such as AGO-CLIP (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) in identifying Argonaute-bound miRNA-mRNA interactions [23] , hiCLIP (RNA hybrid and individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) in recognizing Staufen-bound structured RNAs [24] , and CLASH (cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids) for characterizing snoRNP-bound snoRNA-rRNA interactions and miRNA interactions [25] . A RAP based method, namely RAP-RNA (RNA antisense purification-RNA), has been proposed to comprehensively characterize in vivo intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions of a target RNA and distinguish direct and indirect interactions through differential usage of crosslinking reagents with different specificities for proteins and nucleic acids [26] ( reversible AMT crosslinking to globally map RNA duplexes in living cells with near base-pair resolution and capture the complexity of RNA structures through direct identification of base-paired helices [28] (Table 2) .

            "text": "RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes are typical functional forms of RNA-protein interactions, which extensively control, at the post-transcriptional level, the expression of genes in eukaryotes. RBPs such as PRC2 (polycomb repressive complex 2), Argonaute (the key player in all small-RNA-guided gene-silencing processes [30] and interact with approximately 20% lncR-NAs), PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, TNRC61-C and Nova interact with RNAs to drive mRNA processing, nuclear export, translation, localization, turnover, etc. For example, the interaction between the Ezh2 protein domain (a RNA binding subunit of PRC2) and RepA (a 1.6 kb ncRNA residing in lncRNA Xist) recruits PRC2 to the X chromosome that leads to X inactivation; and enforced lncRNA HOTAIR expression re-allocates PRC2 to form an occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to altered histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, gene expression and, ultimately, increased cancer metastasis [31] . RNPs are RNA-protein complexes that play an integral part in numerous biological processes, e.g., ribosome in protein synthesis, telomerase in chromosome protection, ribonuclease P in small ncRNA transcription, hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) in gene transcription and post-transcriptional modification, and snRNP in pre-mRNA splicing. RNAs can function as the enzyme, sponge, schaffold, guider during RNA-protein interactions. For instance, the ribosomal RNAs convey enzymatic roles for protein production such as the catalytic peptidyl transferase activity in linking amino acids together (Fig. 3a) ; lncRNA PANDAR acts as a sponge of p53 protein to block its binding with the promoter region of CDKN1A gene in gastric cancer (Fig. 3b) [32] ; the lncRNA Malat1 regulates nascent pre-mRNA processing through recruitment or modification of serine/arginine (SR) proteins localized to these sites [26] (Fig. 3c) ; several types of small RNAs function as the guider of protein enzymes to find their targets for cutting, digestion or modification such as sgRNA in guiding Cas9/dCas9 to certain genomic loci and siRNA in guiding DICER to specific mRNAs (Fig. 3d) .",

Garciablanco et al. developed the RIP (ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation) assay to study RNA-protein interactions in vivo (Table 2) . This technique has been combined with high-throughput technologies and evolved as RIP-Chip (RIP microarray) and RIP-seq (RIP sequencing) [33] to facilitate studies on RNA-protein interactions in the genome-wide scale ( Table 2) . Darnell et al. developed the CLIP (UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) approach to reveal the interactions between RNAs and their binding proteins through in vivo UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (Table 2) ; and later proposed the HITS-CLIP technique by combining CLIP with highthroughput sequencing to produce transcriptome-wide RNA binding maps with higher accuracy and resolution [34] ( Table 2 ). Tuschl et al. developed a step-by-step protocol for the transcriptome-wide isolation of RNA segments bound by the protein of interest from the background un-crosslinked RNAs, namely PAR-CLIP (photoactivatable ribonucleosideenhanced crosslinking an immunoprecipitation), via introducing photoreactive nucleosides that generate characteristic sequence alterations on crosslinking, converting isolated crosslinked RNA fragments into a cDNA library followed by deep-sequencing [35] (Table 2 ). Ule et al. developed individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP (iCLIP) to identify protein-RNA crosslink sites with nucleotide resolution, where the use of two cleavable adapter regions and barcode that enables PCR amplification of truncated cDNAs (the truncated sites represent the cross-linked nucleotide contributes) followed by circularization, linear cleavage and high-throughput sequencing contribute to the trick of this technology ( Table 2) . TRAP/RAT (tandem RNA-affinity purification/RNA affinity in tandem) does not depend on formaldehyde nor cross-linking, but is an RNA tag-based method for affinity purification of endogenously assembled RNP complexes followed by mass spectrometry protein identification (Table 2) . RiboTrap is another approach of this kind that purifies targeted RNPs from cell lysates through immunoaffinity precipitation to describe in vivo endogenous assembly of ribonucleoproteins (Table 2) . MS2-BioTRAP (MS2 in vivo biotin tagged RNA affinity purification) coexpresses HB-tagged bacteriophage protein MS2 and stemloop tagged target RNAs in cells followed by HB-tag based affinity purification of authentic RNA-protein complexes, and proteins associated with target RNAs are subsequently identified and quantified using SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry [36] (Table 2) .",

RaPID (RNA purification and identification) allows for the isolation of specific mRNAs of interest and subsequent analysis of the associated proteins using mass spectrometry [38] (Table 2) . A couple of methods have been developed to determine RNA-protein binding specificities. While RNA-Compete (competition between individual RNA sequences binding to proteins), SEQRS (in vitro selection, high-throughput sequencing of RNA and sequence specificity landscapes) [39] , RBNS (RNA Bind-n-Seq) [40] and RNA-MITOMI (RNA-mechanically induced trapping of molecular interactions) [41] capture RNA-protein binding specificities in vitro, RNA-MaP (RNA on a massively parallel array) and HiTS-RAP (high-throughput sequencing-RNA affinity profiling) [42] achieve this in situ. RNA-Compete uses RNA-protein binding followed by microarray analysis to enable high-throughput identification of RNA binding motifs ( Table 2 ). SEQRS is featured by being capable of identifying RNAs interacting with the protein of interest with low binding affinities and multiple binding modes in a single experiment [39] (Table 2) . RBNS novels in measuring the binding affinities both quantitatively and in a high-throughput manner ( Table 2) . RNA-MITOMI provides a microfluidic platform to allow the identification of new binding specificities through screening the interaction of a RNA mutant library with stem-loop-binding protein [41] (Table 2) . RNA-MaP repurposes a high-throughput sequencing instrument to quantitatively measure the binding and dissociation of a fluorescently labeled protein to a library of RNA targets generated on a flow cell surface by in situ transcription [43] (Table 2) . HiTS-RAP allows simultaneous transcription of hundreds of millions of DNA clusters that are each derived from amplifying a single molecule with primers covalently linked to the glass flowcell, and the binding of fluorescently labeled proteins to these transcribed RNA clusters is analyzed afterwards [42] (Table 2) .",

For instance, RNase P enzymes consist of both RNA and protein subunits where the RNA fraction is indispensible for catalyzing the removal of the 5\u2032 leader sequences from tRNA precursors; RNase MRP (mitochondrial RNA processing) enzymes cleave the A4 site in the ITS (internal transcribed spacer) region of pre-rRNAs to generate mature 5.8S rRNA. Some RNAs serve as the guide to specify the sites of modification for the enzyme to execute the catalytic function. For instance, site-specific synthesis of the 2\u2032-O-methylated nucleotides and pseudouridines in rRNAs and snRNAs is guided by snoRNAs through basepairing followed by snoRNP protein catalyzed 2\u2032-O-methyl transfer and uridine-to-pseudouridine isomerization reactions. Some RNAs direct the associated proteins to the targeted sites to trigger conformational change of the substrate for subsequent catalysis. For example, snRNAs constitute a large family with at least 10 members; they form ribonucleoprotein complexes (snRNPs) with their associated proteins and bind specific sequences on the pre-mRNA, resulting in the exposure of nucleotides favorable for splicing.",

LncRNA MRHL (meiotic recombination hot spot locus) interacts with RNPs such as p68, whose down-regulation results in tyrosine-phosphorylated p68 cytoplasmic translocation, \u03b2-catenin nuclear localization, \u03b2-catenin-TCF4 interaction, \u03b2-catenin occupancy at the promoter regions of Wnt target genes and ultimately activated Wnt signaling in mouse [49] . The lncRNA NKILA (NF-kB interacting lncRNA) directly interacts with the functional domains of signaling proteins NF-kB/IkB to form a stable complex that prevents over-activation of NF-kB pathway in inflammation-stimulated breast epithelial cells and ultimately less tumor metastasis [50] . The cytoplasmic lncRNA LINK-A facilitates the recruitment of BRK to the EGFR:GPNMB complex and BRK kinase activation, leading to heterodimer-dependent HIF1\u03b1phosphorylation at Tyr565 and Ser797 by BRK and LRRK2, respectively, HIF1\u03b1 stabilization, HIF1\u03b1-p300 interaction, and HIF1\u03b1transcriptional programs under normoxic conditions.",

Given that lncRNAs are over 200 nucleotides in length, they could fold into complex three-dimensional structures that allow them achieving the regulatory functionalities by interacting with biomolecule partners such as transcription factors, histones and chromatin-modifying proteins.

CircRNAs can function to modulate miRNA activities [51] , regulate alternative splicing [52, 53] , and sponge other factors such as RBPs or RNP complexes [51] . Being a miRNA activity regulator, circRNA could sponge miRNA complexes and potentially release them on cleavage. For instance, circRNA 0000515 sponges miRNA326 to promote cervical cancer progression via up-regulating ELK1 [54] , circRNA TTN acts as a sponge of miRNA432 to facilitate the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts through the IGF2/PI3K/AKT pathway [55] , circRNA NRIP1 functions as a miRNA149-5p sponger to promote gastric cancer progression via AKT1/mTOR signaling [56] , and circRNA TRIM33-12 acts as the sponge of miRNA191 to suppress hepatocellular cancer progression [57] . The regulatory role of circRNA on alternative splicing is associated with circRNA biogenesis. As pre-mRNA splicing is dictated by competitions between alternative pairing of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites and backsplicing during circRNA generation affects the splicing pattern of the remaining pre-mRNA, cir-cRNAs modulate alternative splicing as a process regardless of the functionalities of circRNAs produced [52] . CircR-NAs can also sponge RBPs or RNP complexes to prevent them from acting, provide a protective reservoir of these factors, and deliver them to particular subcellular locations [58] . Lastly, the protein-coding function of circRNAs has been recently identified but still lack sufficient evidence, and novel approaches such as the 'intron-mediated enhancement system' have been proposed to investigate circRNA proteincoding functionalities through increasing circRNA formation [59] .",

This is especially true in eukaryotes and concords with the hypothesis that RNAs devolved some of their functions to DNAs and proteins and pertained the mediating role. RNAs were selected as the primary regulator of many cell events due to their rapid metabolism that is required for dynamic regulation of cellular homostasis. Though RNAs preserve the information storage capacity in prokaryotes as evidenced by RNA viruses, they are simply genetic information storage unit and need to hijack host materials for propagation. This suggests the prominent roles of macromolecular interactions in driving RNA functionalities in any organisms. Importantly, many biological activities involve multi-player interactions, e.g., RNA and protein function together to maintain chromosome stability for telomerase to take on the action mode. Thus, we cannot dissect any function from its context and leave molecular interactions aside.

Viroids are small nonencapsulated circular ssRNAs that are not proteincoding but replicate in plants as free RNA molecules through RNA structure-based interactions with host cellular factors for functionalities and reply on host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II for transcription. For instance, potato spindle tuber viroid modulates its replication through directly interacting with a negative splicing regulator RPL5 [61] . CrRNAs constitute prokaryotic immune system by assisting Cas proteins recognize and cut exogenous DNA. On phage infection, proteo-spacers are lysed by bacteria Cas protein complexes and integrated into the 5\u2032 end of the CRISPR sites in host genome which are then transcribed into crRNAs and function as the template against phage proto-spacers once infected again [62] [63] [64] .",
