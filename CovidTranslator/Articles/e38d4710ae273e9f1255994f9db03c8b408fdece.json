Methods: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled 63 ventilated adult patients with ARDS; 50 as septic and 13 as non-septic, and followed them for 28 days in intensive care units at a university hospital in Taiwan. Serial serum sTREM-1 levels and cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association between biomarkers and clinical infectious diagnosis/outcome in ARDS was explored. Results: Serum sTREM-1 and cytokine levels could not differentiate septic from non-septic ARDS. Serum log sTREM-1 and inflammatory cytokine levels were correlated positively (r = 0.325 for IL-1\u03b2; r = 0.247 for IL-8; r = 0.480 for tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1). As prognostic factors, higher serum sTREM-1 level on day 1 and increasing levels over time, especially in the first 5 days, were independent predictors of mortality on day 28, using a multivariate Cox regression model. Serum sTREM-1 levels remained stable or even increased in the non-surviving patients, but decreased in the survivors. Conclusion: Serum sTREM-1 level might not be a reliable marker for infection in ARDS patients. However, as an inflammatory marker, initial serum sTREM-1 level and its trend over time, especially in the first 5 days, could be predictive of short-term mortality. A progressive decline in serum sTREM-1 levels during followup indicates a favorable outcome, whereas persistently elevated sTREM-1 indicates a poor prognosis and should lead to a re-evaluation of therapy.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating clinical condition with high morbidity and mortality, and can have a septic or nonseptic etiology. 1 Sepsis is the most common cause and has a worse prognosis compared to other risk factors. 2, 3 The discrimination between septic and non-septic causes of ARDS is important, because it can prompt physicians to start multimodal treatment of severe sepsis, including the use of recombinant human activated protein C (drotrecogin-\u03b1), as early as possible. 4, 5 It can also encourage them to feel free to use corticosteroid therapy in the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS without an ongoing infectious process. 6 However, prompt and correct diagnosis of septic ARDS is difficult because many infectious clinical features, such as changes in body temperature, leukocytosis, or tachycardia, are non-specific. A serum biological marker that indicates severe bacterial infection would be useful in this situation. Many inflammatory biomarkers have been studied to differentiate septic from non-septic ARDS, but only a few fulfill the requirements. [7] [8] [9] [10] Trigger receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) has recently been identified as an infectious marker. 11, 12 TREM-1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that consists of a single extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. 11, 13 TREM-1 is a receptor that is expressed on neutrophils and macrophages/monocytes, which are the main effector cells in innate responses. 11, 13 TREM-1 can trigger and amplify the inflammatory response. In the presence of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi, the expression of TREM-1 is greatly upregulated on neutrophils and monocytes, but TREM-1 is hardly expressed at all in non-infectious inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, vasculitis, and granulomatous disorders. 14 Soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) does not have the transmembrane and intracellular domains that are released from activated phagocytes, and can be found in body fluids. [15] [16] [17] [18] In previous studies, the presence of sTREM-1 in the bronchoalveolar fluid has been shown to be a good indicator of lung infection. 16, 18 In addition, serum sTREM-1 has been shown to be able to distinguish survivors from non-survivors of sepsis. 17 However, information on the diagnostic role of sTREM-1 as an infectious marker in ARDS patients has been lacking until now.",

Univariate or multivariate analysis, after adjusting for possible confounding factors, such as recent major abdominal surgery, 24 pancreatitis, 25 active malignancy, 22, 26 or gouty arthritis, 27 showed that septic etiology of ARDS was not associated with elevation of serum log sTREM-1 level. Moreover, considering the duration of SIRS in septic or non-septic groups before the onset of ARDS, it did not seem to affect the serum log sTREM-1 levels according to the univariate, multivariate, or subgroup analyses for patients whose duration of SIRS before enrollment was < 48 hours. These results depart from the findings for sepsis reported by Gibot et al. 15, 17, 23 This could be explained as follows. First, ARDS induced by direct lung injury might have a higher sTREM-1 concentration in the lungs than in the serum. 18, 28 Pulmonary infection or aspirationrelated ARDS might have lower sTREM-1 levels in the serum, although they are classified as septic ARDS. Second, recent clinical studies investigating the role of sTREM-1 in an infectious diagnosis have shown that sTREM-1 is not a good marker for infection in sepsis 29 or ventilator-associated pneumonia 30, 31 in critically ill patients. To explain these discrepancies, some have proposed the following: different sensitivities of the sTREM-1 assays (ELISA or immunoblotting), 31 exposure to antibiotics or lack thereof, 18, 31 inadequate controls in the absence of suspected infection, 30 among patient groups in various studies. 31 Third, limited case numbers and a retrospective definition of non-septic ARDS might compromise the diagnostic value of sTREM-1 for infection. Although serum sTREM-1 might not be suitable as an infectious marker in ARDS, we still noted that, in pathogen-confirmed septic ARDS patients, serum sTREM-1 was higher when cultures grew Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. In patients with Gram-positive coccal, fungal, or viral infections, serum sTREM-1 levels were lower. However, there was no significant difference between them.",

The first 5 days of serum sTREM-1 elevation in ARDS is compatible with the acute exudative phase when alveolar macrophages and neutrophils are recruited in the alveolar space, and most cytokines are released. 33 Our prognostic findings in ARDS patients were similar to those in the sepsis study of Gibot et al. 32 Further intervention was needed for the elevation of serum log sTREM-1 levels, especially during the first 5 days of follow-up, which indicated the progression of a systemic inflammatory response.

This might have been due to a longer drinking history in our younger patients; alcohol abuse is thought to be associated with high mortality in ARDS patients, according to the study of Wakabayashi et al. 35 In addition, a persistent or elevated trend of serum IL-1\u03b2 might have predicted poor prognosis in our multivariate analysis (Table 3) , which was also found in the previous ARDS study of Goodman et al. 7 With regard to serum CRP level in our study, it might be used to differentiate septic and nonseptic ARDS patients, even better than serum sTREM-1. Barati et al reported the same phenomenon as we have: CRP performs better than sTREM-1 in diagnosing infection. 36 Barati et al, however, noted that the diagnostic accuracy of sepsis markers is highly dependent on the setting in which they are tested. Their study was conducted in a heterogeneous group of ICU patients, which was similar to our ARDS group, that consisted of various causative etiologies. The heterogenous population and small number of patients might be the reasons for the different diagnostic value of CRP and sTREM-1. In the analysis of prognostic value, although higher serum CRP level was observed in the non-survivors in univariate analysis, this effect was not seen in multivariate analysis (Table 3 ). It could be because the short-term mortality correlates better with other inflammatory variables, such as the level of serum cytokines or sTREM-1, than with the serum CRP level.",

Second, we did not analyze other inflammatory markers, such as procalcitonin or IL-6. We checked the CRP at day 1, but we did not follow it up during the course of ARDS. Third, we did not investigate the presence of peptic ulcer disease by using pan-endoscopy due to ethical sensitivities for the critical patients who did not present with active gastrointestinal bleeding. Peptic ulcer disease could potentially elevate sTREM-1 levels. 37, 38 Finally, but not least, the non-septic ARDS group in our study was defined by a retrospective review, which could have compromised our conclusion about the diagnostic value of sTREM-1 for sepsis, because of possible occult infections in the group that could not be ruled out. Clinically, precise prospective identification of non-septic ARDS is very difficult, because sepsis is always considered to be the causative differential diagnosis that is lethal if no adequate treatment is taken.
