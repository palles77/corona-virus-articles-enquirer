            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) has been detected primarily in children with acute lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), but its occurrence, clinical profile, and role as a causative agent of RTD are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the potential clinical relevance of HBoV. Using molecular tests, we tested 1352 nasopharyngeal samples obtained between October 1, 2017 and April 30, 2018 from children up to the age of 16 with RTD for the presence of HBoV DNA and 20 other respiratory pathogens at three different hospitals in Belgium. HBoV was detected in 77 children with a median age of 10.6 months. Consecutive samples were available for 15 HBoV-positive children and showed persistent HBoV positivity in four of them. Monoinfection was observed in six infants. Four of them were born prematurely and were infected during hospitalization at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Only one of these six monoinfected children was diagnosed with recurrent wheezing due to HBoV. This child was carried to term and had a high viral load. Coinfections, most frequently with rhinovirus (52.1%) and adenovirus (49.3%), were observed in 72 patients. In seventeen of them in which HBoV was present at high viral load or higher viral load than its copathogens, bronchi(oli)tis (n = 8), recurrent wheezing (n = 8) or episodic wheezing (n = 1) were diagnosed. Our results suggest that HBoV infection at high viral load in infants is associated with wheezing (P = 0.013, Cramer's V = 0.613).",

            "text": "Respiratory tract diseases (RTDs) are a leading reason for morbidity in young children and are caused by a broad spectrum of microbial agents. Viruses account for the largest number of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). The so-called respiratory viruses include influenza A and B viruses (IAV, IBV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human adenoviruses (HAdVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), human coronaviruses (HCoVs), enteroviruses (EVs) and human parechoviruses (HPeVs). In the 21st century, using large-scale molecular virus screening, several novel viruses have been discovered in patients with respiratory infections. These viruses include human metapneumovirus (hMPV), polyomaviruses KI and WU, several coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) as described by Allander et al. in 2005 [1-3] . The DNA virus HBoV is a member of the family Parvoviridae, genus Bocaparvovirus. HBoV is classified into genotypes 1 through 4. HBoV1 is predominantly found in respiratory tract secretions from children with RTD, and HBoV2-4 are found mainly in stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis [3, 4] . HBoV is predominantly present in winter and spring [5] . The average prevalence of HBoV in respiratory tract samples ranges from 1.0% to 56.8%, depending on the country. The worldwide estimate for the total prevalence of HBoV in respiratory infections is 6.3% [6] . HBoV has been reported worldwide in all age groups; however, it has mainly been detected in children who presented at the hospital with RTD. A high HBoV viral load could be an etiologic agent for severe LRTI, and these patients may develop bronchitis and pneumonia with fever, cough and peribronchial infiltrates detected on a chest X-ray [7, 8] . Low viral loads in coinfection indicate more asymptomatic shedding [9] . Furthermore, HBoV has been suggested as a cause of pediatric gastrointestinal (GI) infection [10, 11] and might even have a causal role in encephalitis [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, it has also been found in children with mild infections [16] and in asymptomatic ones, and therefore, the pathogenic role of HBoV is still under discussion [8, 17] . Classically, Koch's postulates have been used to establish a causal relationship between viruses and disease [18] . As there is no animal model so far for HBoV, proving its clinical relevance is challenging. However, HBoV can replicate in human airway epithelium cultures [6, 19] , and Deng et al. showed that HBoV1 induces damage to the airway epithelium (loss of cilia, disruption of the tight junction barrier, and a significant decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance) [20, 21] . Furthermore, serological diagnosis of HBoV has recently confirmed significant increases in IgG antibodies in children with pneumonia. These results support the idea that it is a true pathogen in RTI in children [22, 23] . Prolonged viral shedding has been described, about 2.5 months in outpatients and about 4.5 months to 1 year in hospitalized children, which probably explains why HBoV is detected in asymptomatic cases. This prolonged shedding may also explain why the rate of coinfection with other viruses is so high, ranging from 75% to 85% [24] .",

We were especially interested in patients with HBoV in monoinfection or with HBoV present at a low Cq value (\u2264 22) or a lower category of Cq value than its copathogens in cases of coinfection, since the fundamentals of RT-PCR allow us to understand that lower Cq values represent a higher viral load. The PCR results were analyzed together with the white blood cell count (WBC) and differentiation, the value of C-reactive protein (CRP), the clinical characteristics of the patient (URTD vs. LRTD, GI disease, fever), the duration of hospitalization, the need for oxygen therapy, and results of chest X-ray, if available. A history of underlying conditions such as cardiac disease, prematurity, chronic pulmonary disease or previous episodes of wheezing were studied if present. Bronchiolitis or wheezing in young children is a very common clinical problem, and definitions are often confusing. In this study, we define bronchiolitis as a constellation of clinical signs and symptoms occurring in children younger than 2 years, including a viral URT prodrome followed by increased respiratory effort and wheezing [26, 27] . We diagnosed children younger than two years of age with bronchiolitis if their history showed no previous episodes of wheezing and with \"recurrent wheezing\" if there had been previous episodes. Children older than two years of age with previous episodes of wheezing were diagnosed with episodic wheezing. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was defined as oxygen dependency beyond 28 days of life [28] .",

Out of the 87 samples, 13 (14.9%) were monoinfections and 74 (85.1%) were coinfections with one or more other viruses. The 13 single detections belonged to six infants, the 74 samples with coinfections belonged to 72 children. One child had multiple NPSs that were positive for HBoV in mono-and coinfection, so a total of 77 different children were included in this study ( Fig. 1 ). Coinfections were most frequently seen with HRV (38 samples) and HAdV (36 samples). Coinfection of HBoV with bacteria or fungi was not seen. The HBoV viral load, expressed as a Cq-value, in children with a monoinfection (mean Cq, 26; range, 10-34) was not different from that in children with a coinfection (mean Cq, 28; range, 13-35) (P = 0.445).

Three of them got infected in the same week, so transmission probably occurred via the hospital staff. These premature patients were all treated in incubators and had had no previous contact with other children. The fact that they were in a protected area is probably the reason there was no coinfection. The patients born at 25, 26 and 28 weeks all developed BPD as a sequela of their premature birth. All three were intubated at birth, received surfactant, and needed long-term ventilator support. Two of them developed chronic oxygen dependency and were discharged with home oxygen therapy. The child born at a gestational age of 25 weeks needed conventional ventilation for 17 days, followed by 10 days of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and long-term oxygen treatment. His respiratory condition was aggravated at an age of 70 days by infection with HBoV (Cq value, 10) with a need for repeated CPAP support and a higher oxygen supply. A chest X-ray at this time point showed peribronchial thickening and atelectasis. This child showed persistent HBoV PCR positivity in seven separate determinations (6 in monoinfection, 1 in coinfection). The other three premature infants expressed HBoV at higher Cq values (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) and had only mild deterioration of their respiratory condition. A child born at a gestational age of 26 weeks had severe BPD with a need for invasive ventilation (conventional and high-frequency oscillation) for 33 days followed by 18 days of CPAP. During the infection with HBoV, there was a higher oxygen need. A child born at a gestational age of 28 weeks needed conventional ventilation for 2 days followed by 3 days of oxygen supply by nasal canula. At day 19, infection with HBoV resulted in lower saturation and development of a need for extra oxygen until day 63. A child born at a gestational age of 33 weeks was transferred from another hospital to the NICU because of necrotizing enterocolitis. During her stay, there was an unexplained mild decline in saturation. A respiratory panel showed the presence of HBoV.",

An overview of the results can be found in Table 3 . The median age of these 17 children was 11.8 months (range, 3.3-32.9 months). Five of these children had been born prematurely, with a gestational age ranging from 31 to 34 weeks. All children were hospitalized briefly in a pediatric ward at one of the three hospitals. Symptoms typically started with rhinitis and cough, which developed to tachypnea, wheezing, crackles, and sometimes the use of accessory muscles and nasal flaring.

Upper respiratory pathology such as conjunctivitis, rhinitis, pharyngitis, stomatitis and otitis media was present in 94.1% of the children. Gastrointestinal disorders, ranging in severity from decreased oral intake to vomiting and diarrhea, was observed in 11 children.

            "text": "During the respiratory season 2017-2018, 1352 NPSs were received for molecular respiratory screening. HBoV was detected in 6.4% of the samples, which is in accordance with prevalence data described previously [6] . As the two hospitals use slightly different molecular techniques for diagnosis, infection frequencies can be biased. In agreement with previous studies [29] , coinfection was common (85.1%), which might reflect the high prevalence of viral infections in young children and the prolonged shedding of HBoV [24] . Higher Cq values dominated. Only 23.0% of the specimens had Cq values \u2264 22. Competition or interference between viruses in the respiratory tract could explain the low viral loads observed in the majority of coinfections. In our study, HBoV viral loads were comparable between the monoinfected and coinfected samples, as was also found in previous studies [7, 23, 30] . However, the small number of samples in the monoinfected group makes it difficult to prove any statistical difference between the two. The median age of the HBoV-positive children was 10.6 months. All but one of the children were younger than 3 years of age. This is in agreement with previous studies in which it was observed that most HBoV infections occur between the ages of 6 months and 3 years [5, 23, 29] . This distribution is compatible with protection from infection by maternal antibodies. The mean age of children who express HBoV in monoinfection (3.9 months) is lower than the mean age of children with HBoV in coinfection (14.0 months) (P = 0.016). This makes perfect sense, as older children have had more time to be exposed to different respiratory viruses. Indeed, four 4 prematurely born patients with monoinfection were still hospitalized at the NICU at the time of infection. The HBoV viral load was higher among patients younger than 18 months. This is in concordance with findings of Zhou et al. [7] .",

            "text": "Consecutive samples were available for 15 HBoV-positive children. Four children showed persistent HBoV PCR positivity. In one child with seven consecutive samples, a large decrease in viral load was observed after the initial detection, suggesting that a persistent low-level shedding of HBoV in respiratory secretions may follow the HBoV primary infection. This observation was also seen in the case of a second child in which the Cq value increased from 18 to 32 in a two-week period. The Cq values of a third child are indicative of reinfection in mid-January, as the Cq level begin January was much higher. In the last child, the observation of similar viral load levels at a 5-month interval could be attributed to protracted viral shedding or to reinfection. In four other children, the Cq value for HBoV was already high at the beginning, ranging [16] . Since this is a retrospective study, the NPSs are not available anymore in the laboratory, and we are therefore not able to perform sequencing to distinguish between reinfection and persistence. Long-term shedding, which is a feature shared by other human parvoviruses [31] , might explain the high frequency of codetection of HBoV with other respiratory pathogens. Therefore, the positivity of HBoV does not necessary imply respiratory disease, and it is informative for clinicians to have an indication of the viral load. Proving the clinical relevance and pathogenicity of HBoV is challenging, because fulfillment of Koch's postulates is not possible and because of the high rate of coinfection. One might argue that HBoV is only an aggravating factor of respiratory disease, a persisting virus that is reactivated by the inflammatory process or an innocent bystander that is just detected by chance [32] . Many studies have confirmed the association between HBoV infections in hospitalized children and wheezing episodes [33] [34] [35] , while other studies fail to find an obvious relationship between HBoV infection and distinct clinical manifestations [24] . In our monoinfected group, three infants were born at a gestational age of 25-28 weeks and already had weak lungs and an immature immune system as a result of their premature birth. All three met the consensus criteria for BPD. As it is known that children with BPD have an increased risk of developing severe disease when acquiring a respiratory viral infection, it is difficult to reliably attribute the observed clinical respiratory signs to the pathogenicity of HBoV. Nevertheless, we saw deterioration of the patients' respiratory status with higher oxygen need and a need for more ventilator support at the time of infection in all three cases. In the monoinfected group, there was only one infant, who was 4.9 months old and without comorbidities, hospitalized at the PICU, for which there was a clear causal relationship between the presence of HBoV at a low Cq value and wheezing. Thus, in our study, only one child out of 77 HBoV-infected children needed hospitalization at the PICU because of severe acute respiratory distress due to HBoV infection. This is lower than the 3.93% observed in a study by Moesker et al. [17] .",

In these patients, a viral URT prodrome followed by breathing difficulties and wheezing were the most frequently reported clinical signs, and bronchi(oli)tis and recurrent wheezing were the leading diagnoses. In this group, a relationship was observed between HBoV and LRTD. Some previous studies have found high viral loads to be associated with more-severe symptoms [9] , while others have failed to find a clear relationship [5, 7, 23] . In our opinion, it is not possible to establish a clear relationship between viral load and severity of LRTD. In the past, many scoring systems have been developed in an attempt to quantify respiratory distress objectively, but few have demonstrated any predictive validity [36] . Since clinical parameters such as respiratory rates or use of accessory muscles were sometimes lacking in the medical files, it was not possible to make a 100% correct statement about severity. We may assume that all children who needed hospitalization, and certainly those who developed hypoxia with a need for extra oxygen or ventilator support, had rather severe clinical signs.",
