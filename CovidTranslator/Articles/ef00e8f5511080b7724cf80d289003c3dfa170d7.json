As a result, inflammatory responses must be tightly controlled, and many unique mechanisms seem to contribute to this control. In addition to being important causes of human disease, RNA viruses that infect the CNS provide useful models in which to study immune responses in the CNS. Recent work has shown the importance of innate immune responses in the CNS in controlling virus infection. And advances have been made in assessing the relative roles of cytotoxic T cells, antibodies and cytokines in the clearance of viruses from neurons, glial cells and meningeal cells.",

            "text": "Virus infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are relatively uncommon, but potentially devastating. The longevity of many cells in the CNS and the relative inaccessibility of this tissue to components of the immune system make the brain and spinal cord particularly susceptible to persistent virus infection. Because of the potential for neurological damage by inflammatory mediators and cytotoxic cells, the brain has intrinsic mechanisms for controlling immune responses that are different from other organs. Nevertheless, many virus infections are cleared from the CNS through virus-specific immune mechanisms without marked neurological damage. Clearance of virus from nonneural tissues often involves cytolytic elimination of the infected cells. However, immune responses to virus infection of the CNS can also clear the virus from the tissue or sustain prolonged inhibition of virus replication without damage to the structure or function of the nervous system. Non-cytolytic clearance mechanisms are advantageous to the host when the infected cells cannot be replaced, but they might provide less complete elimination of the virus than cytolytic processes. Mechanisms for non-cytolytic clearance are beginning to be elucidated and new roles have been identified for lymphocytes, local antibody production and cytokines. The degree to which clearance is successful differs with the type of virus that causes the infection and with the target cells that the virus infects.",

DNA viruses that infect the CNS have nuclear phases in their replication cycles and often have an inherent capacity to remain latent in the nucleus (and undetectable to the immune system), either by integrating a copy of the virus genome into host DNA or by maintaining an episomal form of the virus genome in the cell nucleus. These viruses are common causes of disease in immunocompromised hosts because of their ability to reactivate when host immune responses fail. Most RNA viruses replicate only in the cytoplasm and do not establish true latency and, therefore, are susceptible to different mechanisms of immune control than are DNA viruses. This review focuses on the immune response to RNA viruses in the CNS.",

These viruses do not usually cause serious disease or persistent infection because they infect renewable cells in a part of the nervous system that is accessible to the immune system. Less common, but more likely to cause fatal disease, are viruses that infect neurons. Neurons are long-lived, terminally differentiated cells that are important target cells for viruses causing This is formed by endothelial tight junctions that limit entry of leukocytes, immunoglobulins, cytokines and complement proteins into the central nervous system. studies of immune responses to neuronal infection have been with rabies virus and mosquito-borne alphaviruses, such as Sindbis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Semliki Forest virus, that can cause acute encephalomyelitis in mice. The most extensive studies of immune responses to viruses that infect glial cells, often in addition to neurons, have involved the natural mouse pathogens Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), which is a picornavirus, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which is a coronavirus. Another natural mouse pathogen, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is an arenavirus that can infect ependymal cells, choroid plexus cells or neurons, has also been studied extensively. LCMV, as well as Borna disease virus, can cause immune-mediated disease and persistent infection of the CNS. For all of these RNA viruses, the outcome of infection depends on the age and genetic background of the mouse, and on the strain of virus that is studied. For this review, the focus is on immune responses of adult animals to the most commonly studied strains of each virus. These infections have many common, as well as distinctive, features. Immune responses to each infection progress through several phases that start with intrinsic responses in the CNS as the presence of the pathogen is recognized, followed by entry of lymphocytes and monocytes from the periphery as part of the adaptive inflammatory response, and then complete or partial silencing of immune-mediated inflammation as the virus is cleared or its replication is controlled.",

Rapid production of TYPE 1 INTERFERON (IFN) is important for host survival and, in most experimental virus infections of the CNS, susceptibility to fatal disease is markedly increased in mice that lack the receptor for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 7\u221210 . IFN-\u03b2, an immediate early IFN, which is produced by neurons as well as glial cells, is the main type 1 IFN that is produced by the CNS and is required for efficient induction of IFN-\u03b1 in vitro 11, 12 . Preferential production of IFN-\u03b2 rather than IFN-\u03b1 in the CNS might be neuroprotective, as IFN-\u03b1 has marked CNS toxicity compared with IFN-\u03b2 13, 14 , and IFN-\u03b2 might induce the production of neurotrophic factors by astrocytes 15 and the local production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) 16 . Rapid local production of type 1 IFN after infection encephalomyelitis (BOX 1) . Not all types of neuron are equally susceptible or likely to become infected; this depends on the virus tropism, route of entry of the virus into the CNS and the mechanism of spread. Many neuronotropic viruses spread within the nervous system by axonal transport and move from neuron to neuron through connecting synapses 1 . If infection is induced experimentally by intracerebral inoculation, there might also be rapid spread through the cerebrospinal fluid 2 . Other viruses target the supporting glial cells of the CNS -oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia -alone or in addition to neurons. Oligodendrocytes form and maintain the myelin that surrounds the axons of neurons, and infection of these cells might lead to acute or chronic demyelinating disease. Astrocytes are the 'supporting' cells for neurons. Among other functions, they produce neurotrophic factors, remove toxic materials and maintain the BLOOD\u2212BRAIN BARRIER. Infection of these cells might also indirectly damage neurons. Microglia are the resident macrophages of the CNS, can express MHC class I and class II molecules, have an important role in local immune responses and can produce various factors that are toxic to neurons.",

It is generally agreed that, although there are cells that can present antigen to primed T cells in the CNS, the activation of naive T cells and B cells occurs in secondary lymphoid tissues outside the CNS 32\u221234 . The parenchyma of the normal CNS does not contain dendritic cells, although they are present in the meninges and cerebro\u2212 spinal fluid (CSF) 35 . Some of the CSF and CNS interstitial fluid drains to the deep cervical lymph nodes through the nasal submucosa 32, 36 . Experimental inoculation of virus directly into the CSF elicits a potent immune response, whereas inoculation directly into the brain parenchyma elicits little or no response 37 . Responses that are initiated by inoculation of antigen into the CSF tend to be characterized by marked antibody responses, priming of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells and no DELAYED-TYPE HYPERSENSITIVITY 32 . However, essentially all neurotropic viruses naturally initiate infection in the periphery either through the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract or the bite of an infected mosquito or animal. Therefore, induction of the virus-specific immune response occurs through virus infection, or uptake by dendritic cells in peripheral tissue and antigen presentation in lymph nodes that drain those initial sites of replication, rather than in the CNS. The entry of circulating leukocytes into the CNS is generally restricted by the tight junctions and by the relative nonreactivity of cerebral capillary endothelial cells, which have limited endocytosis and expression of adhesion molecules 38, 39 . However, several studies have shown that activated T cells routinely cross the blood\u2212brain barrier as part of the normal immunological surveillance of all tissues 39\u221241 (FIG. 1a) . Transendothelial migration of activated CD4 + T cells occurs, in part, through the interaction of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand, which is expressed by activated T cells, with P-selectin, which is expressed at low levels by normal cerebrovascular endothelial cells 38, 42 . However, one side effect of the induction of a systemic immune response, even in the absence of infection in the CNS, is the upregulation of expression of adhesion molecules by CNS endothelial cells and increased surveillance of the CNS by activated T cells 43, 44 . Activated T cells that enter the CNS are not retained in the CNS in the absence of antigen, and slows virus spread and constrains virus replication before the induction of virus-specific adaptive immune responses. Virus inhibition of type 1 IFN production or activity -for example, by the leader protein of TMEV -increases the probability that the virus will not be cleared 17 .",

The factors that are produced by neurons in response to injury -which includes injury caused by virus infection -are not completely catalogued, but they probably include the cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6, and the chemokines fractalkine (CX3CL1) and secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC, CCL21), in addition to IFN-\u03b2 19\u221221 . CX3CL1 is a membrane-bound chemokine that is constitutively expressed by subsets of neurons and is rapidly cleaved from the cell surface after neurotoxic damage 22 . Macrophages and glial cells express the CX3CL1 receptor (CX3CR1) and so become activated in early phases of the response to neuronal infection 23, 24 , in which they have an important role. Activated microglia and astrocytes can rapidly produce an array of cytokines and chemokines.

CNS GANGLIOSIDES either leave or die in situ (FIG. 1a) . However, activated T cells are retained in the CNS when the relevant antigen is present and associated with appropriate MHC molecules 39 . During inflammation, local production of chemokines and induction of expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells further enhance the entry of activated cells into the CNS 45 . Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1, CD54) and vascularcell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) is upregulated by cerebral capillary endothelial cells during virus infection, and antibody specific for the integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1), which is the ligand for ICAM1, blocks lymphocyte entry into the brain during the acute inflammatory response to Sindbis virus 39 .",

However, neurons rarely express MHC class I molecules. Neurons respond to IFN-\u03b2 with induction of antiviral proteins, such as 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase, but not with expression of MHC class I molecules 48 . Suppression of expression of MHC class I molecules by neurons seems to be both transcriptional and post transcriptional. There is little translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) -a key transcription factor for MHC class I expression -in neurons in response to pro-inflammatory mediators for example, TNF and IL-1 or virus infection, despite the presence of these receptors. By contrast, astrocytes readily respond in this manner. Lack of NF-\u03baB translocation in neurons seems to be due to a failure to induce degradation of the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB\u03b1) in response to cytokines 48, 49 . However, neurons that are damaged or electrically silenced by treatment with a neurotoxin can be induced to express MHC class I molecules by treatment with IFN-\u03b3 50 . In vivo, the levels of mRNAs that encode MHC class I heavy chain, \u03b2 2 -microglobulin (\u03b2 2 m), transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1) and TAP2 are increased in neurons during infection 46 . However, there is controversy over whether mature MHC class I molecules are expressed on the neuronal cell surface 46, 51 . The \u03b2 2 m molecules that are sometimes detected on the neuronal cell surface might be associated with expression of T HELPER 1/2 CELLS (T H 1/2). At least two distinct subsets of activated CD4 + T cells have been described. T H 1 cells produce interferon-\u03b3, lymphotoxin and tumournecrosis factor, and support cellmediated immunity. T H 2 cells produce interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13, support humoral immunity and downregulate T H 1-cell responses.",

First, there is inhibition of virus spread to new cells, then elimination of cell-free infectious virus. Subsequently, virus-infected cells must be eliminated or intracellular virus replication permanently suppressed. The most frequently measured parameter of virus clearance is the amount of infectious virus that is present in CNS tissue. However, as antibody specific for the virus is produced, the ability to detect infectious virus by standard assays, which depend on the detection of viral cytopathic effects in susceptible indicator cells, is compromised by the presence of neutralizing antibody in the tissue homogenates. During this phase of clearance, virus can often be detected by cocultivation of cells from the infected tissue with susceptible tissue culture cells. As replication in cells is suppressed or infected cells are eliminated, quantitative measurement of virus nucleic acid provides the best indicator of whether the virus has truly been eliminated from the relevant cells and tissue.",

An important role for CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in virus clearance that is associated with the production of IFN-\u03b3 has also been shown for a neuronotropic strain of MHV 61 . IFN-\u03b3 also has a role in the clearance of vesicular stomatitis virus, a virus that is related to rabies virus, from neurons, perhaps through the production of nitric oxide 95 . CD8 + T cells alone can clear LCMV from persistently infected neurons after a prolonged period of time 96 and these cells might produce anti-viral factors in addition to IFN-\u03b3. For example, the cytotoxic effector molecule granzyme A seems to have an additional role in restricting the replication of herpes simplex virus in neurons 97 . However, in contrast to its essential role in non-cytolytic clearance of hepatitis B virus from hepatocytes, there is no evidence of a role for TNF in clearing virus from neurons 94,98 . Interestingly, neurons in different regions of the CNS differ in their ability to respond to the anti-viral effects of IFN-\u03b3. Motor neurons in the spinal cord show complete resolution of infection in the absence of antibody, whereas cortical neurons require antibody for the clearance of Sindbis virus 94 . Whether this is due to differences in the ability to bind IFN-\u03b3 or to differences in the ability to respond to IFN-\u03b3 is not known. The IFN-\u03b3 receptor is widely expressed by neurons and constitutive expression by neurons is markedly higher than it is by glial cells 99 . their resistance to apoptosis. If infected cells are allowed to survive, the clearance of virus must include mechanisms for inhibiting intracellular synthesis of virus nucleic acid and protein, and for removing virus genomes from cells.

In general, antibody responses have an important role in the clearance of viruses from neurons, whereas T-cell-mediated responses are more important for clearance from glial cells, for reasons that are not yet understood. However, as with any important biological process, mechanisms for the control of virus replication are redundant and overlapping. Experimental approaches to define these clearance mechanisms are dependent on the transient depletion of specific immune-cell populations and on the use of mice that have selective deficiencies in various components of the immune system. Because of the interdependent relationships of components of the immune system in the development of an immune response, deficiencies of one type of cell or molecule might affect several facets of the immune response, making it difficult to identify specific effectors that are crucial for in vivo clearance.",

            "text": "Clearance from glial cells. Clearance of infectious virus from glial cells seems to be more complicated than clearance from neurons and is probably dependent on T cells (FIG. 2) , perhaps because these cells are more likely to be induced by inflammatory mediators to express MHC molecules. In the best-studied examples of virus infection of glial cells -TMEV and MHV -clearance mechanisms often fail, which results in persistent infection and immune-mediated demyelinating disease in susceptible strains of mice. TMEV has an early encephalitic phase, which mainly involves infection of neurons, followed, in genetically susceptible strains of mice, by persistent infection of glial cells. Clearance www.nature.com/reviews/immunol R E V I E W S endothelial cells and lymphocytes that are responsible for entry of the earliest T and B cells involved in immune surveillance and initiation of inflammation are unclear. The molecular mechanisms involved in non-cytolytic virus clearance from neurons are not defined for any of the model infections that are being studied. Knowledge of these mechanisms would allow the identification of cell-type-dependent differences -that is, between different neuronal populations, oligodendroglia, astrocytes and microglia -in response to various immune mediators, such as IFNs and antibodies. Another important area of investigation will be the use of new genetic information to identify host determinants that affect inflammation, virus persistence in the CNS, and host susceptibility to fatal virus and immune-mediated disease. This information will help the development of new treatments for infections of the CNS caused by RNA viruses. For example, knowing the target virus proteins and contributions of specific components of the immune response will help in rational vaccine design. In addition, the ability of passively transferred immune serum that contains polyclonal antibody to aid the clearance of virus indicates that therapeutic monoclonal antibodies can be developed for post-exposure prophylaxis. This could potentially be combined with the appropriate use of cytokines that are involved in virus clearance. Whether such approaches would be therapeutically useful after the development of symptoms that are associated with neuronal loss or dysfunction is less clear.",
