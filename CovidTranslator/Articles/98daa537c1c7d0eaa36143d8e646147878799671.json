Such a vaccine would require the approval of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study is the first to examine the public's willingness to accept the use of an EUA vaccine and drug under the conditions in which they may be offered during this pandemic. This article explains the EUA mechanism, provides an update on the H1N1 vaccine, discusses factors that affect vaccine uptake, and examines specific contextual issues that may affect uptake of an EUA vaccine or drug. We present results of a national survey that (1) examines public attitudes toward the use of a new H1N1 vaccine, (2) explores worry and willingness to take an EUA drug for oneself and one's child, and (3) examines the impact of specific allowable conditions for distribution of an EUA on willingness to accept such a drug or vaccine. These issues are particularly compelling for multiple reasons. First, as we plan for potential distribution of H1N1 vaccine this fall, understanding public reaction to a novel vaccine is essential. Second, children are at heightened risk for H1N1. And, finally, we currently have EUAs that allow use of antiviral drugs for children. Understanding public reaction to these issues is critical to our pandemic planning.",

            "text": "Effective risk communication that targets healthcare providers and the public is essential in a pandemic. However, the FDA has modest expectations with regard to communication to the public about an EUA. The FDA Commissioner mandates that ''to the extent practicable, [emphasis added]'' the manufacturers of the drug provide fact sheets for the healthcare provider or authorized dispenser and to the recipient. 5 The FDA ''expects that some form of written information will be given to recipients, similar to the Fact Sheet for health care providers or authorized dispensers.'' However, FDA's guidance is confusing. While it provides the commissioner with the authority to mandate fact sheets for providers and recipients, the FDA does so only ''to the extent practicable given the circumstances of the emergency.'' 5 Therefore, these fact sheets are not required if the urgency of the emergency is such that their production or distribution would slow administration of the EUA drug or vaccine. If practicable, the manufacturer may use a variety of channels to disseminate information, including public service announcements, videos/DVDs, websites, and healthcare providers. The FDA recommends that fact sheets be tailored to audience level of education and literacy and, when possible, pretested for clarity ''particularly regarding messages on uncertainty and relative risks.'' Thus far in the H1N1pandemic, the FDA has authorized the emergency use of two drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza, as well as use of an N95 respirator and 3 RT-PCR diagnostic test kits. 7, 10, 11 Currently, there are fact sheets for healthcare providers and the public on each EUA, available in English only, on CDC's Emergency Use Authorization website. The FDA EUA declarations for Tamiflu and Relenza explicitly require written information about the use of the drug. 7 There may well be more EUAs issued during the pandemic. In fact, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology explicitly called for consideration of a possible EUA for the intravenous use of antivirals. 12 FDA guidance also permits the distribution of the EUA drug or vaccine by authorized dispensers other than health professionals and in non-healthcare settings. 6 Currently, there is significant concern that the sheer demands of providing mass immunizations could prompt the use of non-health professionals to distribute a vaccine.

            "text": "Although the EUA is a new concept for the American public, the literature on acceptance of vaccines, including novel vaccines, and experiences with the anthrax vaccine in 2001 provides guidance for H1N1 communication. According to Quinn et al, 13 factors that affect vaccine uptake include clear recommendations from physicians, the public's subjective risk, social networks, and belief in the vaccine's safety. The literature documents multiple factors associated with reluctance to accept a vaccine, including concerns about vaccine safety, mistrust and fears about motivations for vaccination, perceived lack of a clear recommendation, and outrage factors. 13 Outrage factorswhich include uncertainty, controllability, voluntariness, trust, dread, effects on children, media attention, benefits, familiarity, and others-affect how we perceive risk. Many of these factors are particularly pertinent with novel vaccines or drugs. 14 In the context of the smallpox vaccination, the most relevant factors were: incomplete knowledge of the risk of an attack, limited knowledge about adverse effects, perceived risk of adverse effects and desire to wait and observe what happened to early vaccine recipients, belief that benefits did not outweigh risks and that vaccinations were not necessary, complex weighing of perceived risk of smallpox versus the risk from the vaccine, potential decisional conflict, and concerns about compensation. 13 Other studies have found that vaccine acceptance is positively affected by perceived benefit of vaccination, perceived greater risk and worry about bioterrorism, positive beliefs about vaccines in general, and female gender. 13 There is only 1 study that examines the acceptability of drugs that are not fully approved by FDA, albeit in a hypothetical situation. Paek et al., 15 in their study of public knowledge about pandemic flu, report that there is a general lack of support for the use of non-approved drugs. The authors suggest testing communication using the term ''investigational'' versus ''non-approved'' to see if the former has more support than the latter. However, an EUA does not constitute an investigation. In other words, there is no research and no informed consent involved in an EUA.",

Quinn et al. found that lack of a clear recommendation, uncertainty, risk perception, perceptions about inequity, and lack of trust contributed to less willingness by affected postal workers to accept the anthrax vaccine. 13 These same factors, along with agency disagreements and mixed and changing messages, also reduced trust and credibility for public health agencies. 13, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] In the anthrax attack, some evidence exists that postal workers perceived the vaccine, offered as an investigational new drug, as experimentation 16, 22 and that those who chose to be vaccinated had a higher level of trust in public health professionals than did those who refused. 16 The Trust Determination Model-composed of caring and empathy, competence and expertise, dedication and commitment, and honesty and openness-is a key element for effective crisis and emergency risk communication. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Other studies assert that fiduciary responsibility, absence of bias, predictability, and fairness are critical to trust. 23, 28, 29 The literature identifies key dynamics that diminish trust, including ''disagreement among experts, lack of coordination among organizations, an unwillingness to acknowledge risks, unwillingness to disclose information, perceived irresponsibility in managing risk, and insensitivity of authorities to the public's need for dialogue.'' 21(p208) Uncertainty and the Proposed H1N1 Vaccine There has been significant media coverage of the production of the H1N1 vaccine. 30, 31 There has also been speculation about whether the vaccine will be an EUA drug. 8, 31 This potential for an EUA, along with discussion of whether an adjuvant would be needed in order to boost the effectiveness of the vaccine, was raised in a Washington Post article: ''The ingredient is not licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, but the agency has the power to authorize the use of such products in an emergency.'' 31 Adjuvants are not approved for use in flu vaccines in the U.S. 32 However, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has signed contracts for bulk supplies of antigen and adjuvant with Novartis and GlaxoSmith-Kline, 33 and there have been calls from within the U.S. and in the international community for the U.S. to use an adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine so that supplies may be stretched, allowing greater equity in access to the vaccine. 34, 35 Novartis began clinical trials in early August with 2 vaccines, 1 of which uses an adjuvant. 36 Additionally, the President's Advisory Council on Science and Technology acknowledged that supplies of MF59, an adjuvant, were stockpiled for potential use, but they urged HHS to identify specific criteria for making a decision to use an adjuvant, largely due to the resulting need for an EUA. 12 These uncertainties, coupled with the media discussion of the 1976 swine flu vaccine controversy, 37, 38 create an atmosphere of potential confusion and concern. Should the media contribute to any misunderstanding of the EUA as an investigational drug, we could encounter issues similar to those raised by postal workers who saw themselves as guinea pigs in light of changing treatments and the offer of the anthrax vaccine. 18, 22 This study provides insights into public attitudes that can affect decision making about the use of EUAs and into ways to improve communication with the public about such vaccines or drugs.",

To recruit panel members, KN uses a combination of random-digit dial and addressbased probability sampling methods. To ensure that they minimize the exclusion of low-income panelists, KN provides panelists with access to the internet and hardware, if necessary. Panelists participate in online research studies in return for internet access and hardware or for points redeemable for cash. For this study, a national sample of 2,498 adults 18 years old or older, including oversamples of African American and Hispanic adults, was randomly drawn from KN's panel and contacted by e-mail to participate.* Between June 3, 2009, and July 6, 2009, 1,543 respondents completed the survey, for a completion rate of 62%. KN's procedures include both e-mail and telephone reminders to maximize participation. KN provided a data file with weighting variables, which incorporate designbased weights to account for the recruitment of the panelists and both panel-based and study-specific poststratification weights benchmarked against the Current Population Survey (CPS) for May 2009 with respect to demographic and geographic distributions of the population ages 18 and over. All results reported here are weighted to be nationally representative. More information on the KN research panel is available from their website. 39, 40 ",

The exact wording and order of the questions are shown in Table 4 . When respondents were asked, if they had to make a decision now would they be willing to take ''a new, but not yet approved vaccine,'' 63.5% indicated they would not take it (Table 4 ). Almost 28% were undecided. Only 8.7% were willing to take the vaccine. Overall, 48.8% said they would be very or extremely worried if they ''were offered a flu vaccine that was recently developed and not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.'' Of those who reported being moderately to extremely worried, 70% would refuse the vaccine (Table 5) ; only 4% of the most worried, compared to 23.4% of those who reported being not at all or slightly worried, would accept the vaccine ( p < 0.001). Race was significantly associated with refusal to take the vaccine (Table 5) : 66.5% of whites and 60% of blacks, compared to 47.4% of Hispanics, would refuse the vaccine ( p < 0.001).

With a vaccine currently in clinical trials, there is also uncertainty as to whether it will contain an adjuvant and=or require 2 doses. Given this complexity, communication about the H1N1 vaccine is enormously challenging. The additional factor of a possible EUA further complicates the communication challenge. Ensuring that people most at risk choose to accept the vaccine, should it be offered under an EUA, will require effective risk communication based on information about public attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccines and the EUA. Of additional concern is that EUA drugs will continue to be significant tools for treatment, thus requiring clear communication with the public and providers about such drugs.",

During the 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign, physicians' recommendations were found to be a significant predictor of people's vaccination behavior. 47 Although having one's provider recommend an EUA vaccine will not guarantee acceptance, the literature suggests that a clear recommendation from the provider can be effective. We believe that the federal government must mount an intensive, ongoing campaign to reach healthcare providers, including school nurses, physicians, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel, and others. It is essential that they fully understand the potential implications of an EUA vaccine, recognize the complexity of the vaccine schedule, have tools in hand to communicate clearly with patients, and put systems in place to remind those who may need a second H1N1 vaccine dose.",

Flu vaccine with this extra ingredient is widely sold in Europe but never has been sold here, and there's little information about their safety in young children or pregnant women. While both adjuvantfree and adjuvant-added swine flu vaccine is being tested in the U.S. and abroad, using it outside of those studies would require a completely separate government decision. 57 While there is still so much uncertainty about the characteristics of the new vaccine, it seems appropriate to educate the public about the differences without framing one as familiar and safe and the other as unknown and potentially dangerous.

            "text": "Since the acceptance of this article on Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for vaccines and drugs, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has rapidly unfolded, including the release of early results from clinical trials and approval of 4 novel H1N1 vaccines on September 15, 2009. As of September 18, clinical studies continue on the vaccine with special populations of children and pregnant women. Additionally, there remains at least 1 pending application for approval of a vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Experience tells us that with influenza comes uncertainty and the need to be prepared for unexpected changes in the virus and its impact on human health. At this point, it appears that the FDA will not use the option of an EUA for H1N1 vaccine. However, should the pandemic warrant reconsideration of an adjuvant in vaccines, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has urged the Department of Health and Human Services to identify criteria that it would use in that policy decision. Regardless of whether the FDA ultimately employs the EUA mechanism for H1N1 vaccines, there are currently existing EUAs for antiviral medications, and there may be another EUA application for intravenous use of antivirals. The issue of EUAs remains relevant in this pandemic, and lessons learned today can have an impact on our ability to address public response to EUAs in future public health emergencies.-Sandra Quinn, September 18, 2009 ",
