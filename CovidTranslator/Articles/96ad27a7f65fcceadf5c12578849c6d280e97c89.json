The objective of this study was to determine if CDP capacity (i.e., skills and resources) and involvement in CDP programming improved in public health organizations in Canada from 2004 to 2010. Data for this repeated crosssectional study were drawn from two waves of a national census of organizations mandated to carry out primary prevention of chronic disease and/or promotion of healthy eating, physical activity and tobacco control. Medians for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables were compared across time. Neither resources nor level of priority for CDP increased over time. There was little difference in the proportion of organizations with high levels of skills and involvement in core CDP practices (i.e., needs assessment, identification of relevant practices, planning, evaluation). Skills and involvement in CDP risk factor programming showed some gains, some steady states and some losses. Specifically, skill and involvement in tobacco control programming declined markedly while the proportion of organizations involved in healthy eating and physical activity programming increased. Skills to address and involvement in programming related to social determinants of health remained low over time as did involvement in * Corresponding author. 3875, rue Saint-Urbain, 1st Floor,",

On the one hand, failure to deal adequately with public health crises such as the contamination of drinking water in Walkerton, Ontario and the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, underscored serious deficiencies in the public health system. On the other hand, the role of public health expanded in health promotion and the primary prevention of chronic disease. Significant developments included, among others, the creation of the Institute for Public and Population Health as one of the Canadian Institutes for Health Research in 2000, and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the National Collaborating Centres for Public Health in 2004. 1,2 The Canadian Population Health Initiative, which has a particular focus on the social determinants of health, 3 was launched in 1999 to provide information on the health status and the determinants of health among Canadians. 4 Provincial changes in the public health infrastructure were also underway, beginning with the creation of the Institut national de sant e publique du Qu ebec in 1999, followed by restructuring of the health system in many provinces from 2000 to 2010. 5 Initiatives to develop workforce capacity, define core public health competencies and support training programs were advanced, 6, 7 and the number of Canadian universities offering a professional degree in public health (i.e., Masters of Public Health programs) more than tripled from five to over 15. 8 Several universities across Canada began the process of building Schools of Public Health.",

This multimillion dollar program spanning 15 years (mid-1980s to the late 1990s) comprised province-wide surveys of cardiovascular disease risk factors, 13 demonstration projects aimed at developing and evaluating heart health promotion projects 14 and dissemination projects to incorporate lessons learned into provincial public health systems. 15 This initiative led to the involvement of the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector in public health programming, as well as the creation of multi-organization coalitions and alliances as new forms of public health organizations. An explicit goal was to increase capacity for health promotion and CDP in the public health system.",

In addition, public health organization housing divisions or units dedicated to CDP activities became larger. These findings may reflect the changeability that characterizes the regionalized healthcare systems implemented in nine of the ten provinces during the 1990s. 16 Changes to the regional model since 2004 ranged from consolidation of two or more health regions as in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador (2005), and New Brunswick (2008), to complete abolition of regional health authorities as in Prince Edward Island (2005) and Alberta (2008). Such structural transformation creates disruption in CDP programming through, and not limited to, loss of trained personnel, change and/or increase in workloads, increased uncertainty among public health practitioners (regarding differences in cultures between merging organizations) and the public (regarding level of community involvement in decisionmaking and planning). 17e19 Further, there is evidence 20 that sectors similar to CDP, which rely more on people than technology to deliver programs, do not achieve anticipated economies of scale following amalgamations. Most CDP activity is carried out by units within larger structures which focus primarily on health care services. As these structures expand, existing priority attributed to health promotion and disease prevention may erode and the resources for CDP prevention diverted to curative or treatment activities. Macro-level organizational theories 21 postulate that the ability to obtain a stable flow of resources from the environment is a core determinant of the maintenance of infrastructure and the development of services within 22e24 and outside competitive markets. 25 Within the context of the preventive health system, these theories would imply that long-term stability in infrastructure is critical for the preventive health system to building capacity or even maintaining current levels.",

Skills and involvement in CDP risk factor programming showed some gains, some steady states and some losses. Tobacco-related skills and involvement decreased, corresponding to decreases in funding for tobacco control in Canada. 27, 28 Skills to address the social determinants of health and involvement in social determinants of healthspecific programming remained low over time. Although others 29 have documented a paucity of public health interventions that address CDP through action on the social determinants of health, the lack of improvement in skills is surprising given increasing recognition of the importance of the social gradient in chronic disease. 30, 31 The growing pressure to tackle these 'upstream' causes may be tempered by major challenges including: current Canadian political and economic policies; 32 lack of evidence of effective interventions; 33 lack of clarity as to where on the pathway from determinants to outcomes public health would be expected to have impact; 34 significant barriers in partnering with sectors for collaborative cross-sectoral action; 35 and absence of systems to support the application of such programming so that health equity is built into planning and performance indicators. 36 On the plus side, new public policies to prevent overweight 37,38 seem to have translated into increased skills and involvement in healthy eating and, to some extent, physical activity.",

Additionally, in every province, the proportion of organizations designated as 'both' user and resource increased, which may indicate a reduced focus on implementation of programs if organizations are now involved in both activities. Although the most effective mix of user to resource organizations is not known, this trend raises questions about if and how CDP programs, policies and services reach the populations targeted. The decline in the proportion of formal public health resource organizations funded by governments and the increase in the proportion of resource NGOs suggests a shift from the public to the private and notfor-profit sector in CDP innovation and leadership.",

Our findings are, however, consistent with other studies of change efforts in health systems, which document weak linkages between intentions and results, and high levels of status quo preserving resilience. 39e41 Resilience can be explained by many factors but two may be particularly salient. First, to ensure survival, organizations in highly institutionalized environments generally seek to conform to norms in their fields. 41 Although they may slowly evolve, norms are rarely revolutionized, providing a strong foundation for immovability. An example in our context is evaluation capacity. Despite momentum toward evidence-based medical practice, evaluation is still not part of normative organizational capacity in Canadian public health organizations. Second, when there are barriers to workforce renewal, workers in the system remain to all intents and purposes the same. Barriers in the period studied may have included a limited supply of well-trained public health professionals coupled with a growing need for specialized public health expertise in CDP.",
