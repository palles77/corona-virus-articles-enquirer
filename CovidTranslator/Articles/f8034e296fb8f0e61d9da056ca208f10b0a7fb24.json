The knowledge and skill gained by microbiologists that is necessary to isolate, manipulate, and propagate pathogenic microorganisms required parallel development of containment principles, facility design, and practices and procedures to prevent occupational infections in the workplace or release of the organisms to the environment. Biosafety entails safe microbiological practices and procedures and proper use of containment equipment and facilities. To be prudent in biosafety, one must develop knowledge of the principles of epidemiology, disease transmission patterns, risk assessment and risk management, disinfection and sterilization, disease prevention, aerobiology, and environmental control.

In comparison, chemicals hazardous to the living can be fast moving, dramatic, and sudden. While containment is the first line of defense in combating biohazards, containment alone is not effective in the prevention of reactive hazards. No containment is perfect and breaching of barriers can occur, becoming what we term \"accidents.\" After fires and explosions, the major accident that can occur in chemical processing is the release of a chemical that is hazardous to humans. Recall that one of the green chemistry tenets is to eliminate or reduce the use of toxic chemicals in a process. Benign solvents, such as air, water, carbon dioxide, and low-volatility solvents (eg, ionic liquids and molten salt), are preferred. Still, the products we seek or produce are also commonly harmful substances when improperly released. Air and water can become contaminated with chemicals that cause harm. These hazards can be acute (causing immediate and critical harm to people, as in the Bhopal chemical plant toxic gas accident in India) or chronic (groundwater contamination, which can require years and millions of dollars for cleanup).",

The 2015 explosion in the port city of Tianjin, China, for example, shows improper storage of chemicals (in this case, nitrocellulose and ammonium nitrate) can cause extreme harm. Over 100 lives lost to the explosion. For all potential runaway reactions, heat loss possibility and environmental conditions are important, and therefore, scale is important. A small vessel will lose more heat than a large vessel due to the available heat transfer area per volume of the reaction mixture; the large vessel is more adiabatic. A reactive material in a smaller vessel will be stable to a higher temperature than the same material in a larger vessel. The same sample may be safe in a beaker or drum, but may run away in a tanker causing an explosion. A battery may be stable as a single unit, but as a battery pack in a black-cased notebook alongside heat-producing electronic components, heat output may raise the battery temperature causing disintegration and fire. To simulate the real-life or largescale scenario, the sample under investigation must be in an environment without heat loss (or gain). The temperature where the heat production exceeds the heat loss is the temperature of no return (TNR). There is not just one TNR, this value will change as heat-loss potential changes.

The major problem here is that the initiation step can be initiated by a trace amount of an impurity that no one knows is in the bottle. As examples, all tertiary CdH bonds are fairly weak, as are the CdH bonds in aldehydes and alkenes. The reaction can be initiated by traces of these compounds, and the chain is propagated throughout all molecules in the otherwise quite unreactive liquid. 4. The initiation step can be photoinduced.

A slight increase in temperature (perhaps a warm day) can cause the rate of oxidation of the alkane in the oil or the carbon in the coal or the biomass in wood to oxidize, and at some T 0 , the \"reactor\" will suddenly ignite and burn. Once this happens, natural convection forces air rapidly through the barrel or coal pile and \"fans\" the flame. Underground coalfields are especially difficult to extinguish because there are many holes in the ground that act as inlets and outlets for the \"reactor.\" While the CSTR model is extremely primitive, the ideas of size dependence and differences in rate for air flow before and after ignition explain many of the features of these troublesome chemical reactors.",

In Chapters 11 and 12, we examined the cell growth. Cell is produced and it is also the catalyst for more growth. These reactions can be modeled as A + R ! 2R (18.34) because the reaction generates the catalyst after we added the catalyst to initiate the process. Another example was the chain-branching reaction, such as (18.22) H \u00c1 + O 2 ! OH + O \u00c1 (18.22) just described in hydrogen oxidation. The bioreactions were nearly isothermal, but combustion processes are both chain branching and autothermal, and therefore they combine chemical and thermal autocatalysis, a tricky combination to maintain under control and of which bioprocess engineers should always be wary. This suggests immediately the definition of autocatalysis. A reactive intermediate or heat can act as a catalyst to promote the reaction or, more precisely, increase reaction rate. However, in contrast to conventional catalysis, we do not add the catalyst from outside the system, but the catalyst is generated by the reaction. We may add promoters or heat to initiate the process, which then accelerates by autocatalysis. Conversely, we may add inhibitors or cool the reactor to prevent both types of autocatalysis.",

Pyrolysis reactions of biomass are catalyzed by alkali metal salts. One can expect less liquid production when alkali metal salts are present. Table 18 .10 shows the elemental composition of the whole pyrolysis oil (aqueous phase + oil phase) as well as those of the original switchgrass. One can observe that the oil is slightly less oxygenated than the switchgrass itself. The two phases of the oil have very different densities: 1100 kg/m 3 for aqueous phase and 920 kg/m 3 for oil phase.",

Certain bacteria, or enzymes, can be applied to convert syngas to chemicals similar to sugars. Therefore, gasification has been a well-studied method in thermochemical conversions. However, as expected, the bioconversion efficiency is much lower for gaseous substrates than solid/liquid substrates. Table 18 .12 shows the typical compositions of gases in syngas as a function of the oxygen addition. In anaerobic conditions, the gasification process is endothermic. Large amounts of heat are needed to maintain the high temperature (700-1000\u00b0C) as well as to provide energy for breaking the polymer binds. The benefit of anaerobic gasification is the high heating (or energy) value of syngas. Table 18 .12 shows that the low heating value (LHV) of syngas produced with steam as heating medium is 12-14 MJ/Nm 3 , while it is only 4-6 MJ/Nm 3 for syngas produced by partial burning with air. The high energy content in the syngas is desirable. The energy requirement of gasification can be satisfied by adding oxygen in the feed. When oxygen is available, biomass will burn or partially burn to provide energy to the system. However, the burning of biomass will reduce the energy content in the final product gas stream. Therefore, oxygen content should be controlled at low level, just enough to provide heat to maintain the desired gasification temperature.",

This mixture would fizz with a flash of light. Thus were born explosives, which Westerners were the first to turn into materials of warfare in the 15th century. As mentioned previously, the animal waste sources of fixed nitrogen were too limited for conducting a large-scale war, and chemical engineers developed the Haber process for making ammonia from N 2 and the Ostwald process to oxidize NH 3 into NO and thus to HNO 3 .

The velocity of sound in air at 300K is approximately 1100 f/s or 300 m/s. If the velocity of propagation is less than the velocity of sound, the wave is called a deflagration. If it is at or above the velocity of sound, it is called a detonation. Detonation can do much more damage because of the shock wave.

Water was admitted into a storage tank containing this chemical, which caused it to hydrolyze and produce CO, HCN, and unreacted MIC, which spread downwind into a crowded slum nearby and caused many deaths and casualties. The desired reaction to synthesize MIC was CH 3 HN 2 + OCl 2 ! CH 3 NCO + 2HCl (18.45) and the very undesired hydrolysis reactions were CH 3 NCO + H 2 O ! CO + HCN (18.46) all of which are highly toxic. The Bhopal chemical plant was used to produce agricultural pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are important in agriculture to control insect and weed populations so that crop yields can be improved. One wants to produce pesticides and herbicides that are very selective in destroying a particular insect or plant but are not also toxic to other organisms. Here the objectives are to produce a chemical that is toxic to specific plants or animals but not to others. Some desirable characteristics of these chemicals are that they (1) attack only the target pests, (2) do not decompose during storage and shipment, and (3) decompose soon after application so that pesticide residues do not remain on food or contaminate groundwater. Considerable creative engineering goes into formulating and testing these agricultural products.",

The hazards are generally divided into three main categories: health, flammability, and physical. The labeling is visual and easy to understand. In 1992, to avoid confusion and promote trade, the United Nations created a universal identification system, a GHS of classification and labeling of chemicals. The GHS label includes the substance name, ID, eye-catching pictograms to show potential dangers, plus warnings and descriptions on how to handle it. GHS hazard classification also includes three categories: physical, health, and environment. As compared with HMIS and NFPA labeling, GHS combined the flammability hazards into a physical hazard category while one additional category is added for environmental hazard.",

            "text": "Chemical reactivity hazard is defined as a situation where an uncontrolled chemical reaction could result directly or indirectly to seriously harm people, property, or equipment. One common reactivity hazard is fire and explosion, which usually involves strong exothermic reactions. To safeguard processes and facilities, one needs to first identify the threat, or screen for reactivity hazards. When the threats are identified, one can then determine specific remediation by adding barriers or changing the design.. Bioprocess engineers commonly use a design criterion of minimizing the cost or maximizing the profit. Putting up barriers to perceived threats or potential failures ultimately will increase the cost and footprint of the facility.",

Your chances of getting killed driving to and from work are much higher than while at work in the most hazardous job you could have in the chemical industry. Nevertheless, accidents in the chemical industry can be spectacular, with great potential for loss of life and income for many people. The chemical engineer (you) is responsible for creating safe processes and protecting the lives and health of the community.A great deal can and should be said about safety, but we have only been able to outline the principles by which chemical reactors may go out of control. We will conclude our discussion of safety by listing some of the notorious accidents that have occurred in the chemical industry (see Table 18 .14). Energy balance over the reactor, eg, Eq. (18.7), leads toThe energy-balance equation has the appearance of heat removal (due to heat transfer out of the reactor as removed by the cooling water) and heat generation as given by Estimate transient temperatures, velocities, and concentrations versus time with as much accuracy as possible. 18.6.

(b) Why will a small particle be lifted from the fire? (c) One part of this problem is analogous to a hot air balloon. Formulate a model with which you could calculate the size and density for lift and the velocity of the rising spark particle. 18.7. Ammonium nitrate (AN) is a common fertilizer that is an excellent source of nitrogen.(a) Sketch the flow sheet to manufacture AN from CH 4 , air, and water. (This is a combination of several earlier problems.) (b) Fertilizer bags list three numbers, N, P, and K percentages. What are the NPK ratings of AN and of KNO 3 ? (c) Write a reasonable reaction for the decomposition (explosion) of AN. (d) How does the energy release of AN compare with TNT? (e) How many cubic meters of gas would be produced if 1 cubic meter of AN reacted as above and the products were at atmospheric pressure and 20\u00b0C? At 2000\u00b0C? 18.8. A bottle that you thought contained pure diethyl ether actually has autooxidized to 10% diethyl ether hydroperoxide. What is the temperature if the contents of the bottle suddenly react to chemical equilibrium? At what hydroperoxide concentration would the temperature not exceed 100\u00b0C? Assume that the heat of decomposition of the hydroperoxide is 125 kJ/mol. 18.9. Dimethyl ether decomposes to methane and formaldehyde.

Show that if the cooling had been shut off for 10 min after 12 h of operation, no explosion would have occurred for the 9.04 kmol charge. Develop a set of guidelines as to when the reaction should be quenched should the cooling fail. Perhaps safe operation could be discussed using a plot of the time after the reaction began at which the cooling failed, t 0 , versus the length of the cooling failure period, t f , for the different charges of ONCB.
