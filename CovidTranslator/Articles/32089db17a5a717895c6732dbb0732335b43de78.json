Quercetin is flavonoid that occurs naturally in plants and is widely used as a nutritional supplement due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we investigated antioxidant activities and mechanisms of action in zymosan-induced macrophages of quercetin and quercetin-related flavonoids such as quercitrin, isoquercitrin, quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-(2\u2032\u2032-galloyl)rhamnopyranoside (QGR) and quercetin 3-O-\u03b2-(2\u2032\u2032-galloyl)glucopyranoside (QGG) as well as gallic acid, a building moiety of QGR and QGG. QGR and QGG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities compared with quercetin, whereas quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid exhibited weak-tono antioxidant activities, assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, superoxide production, superoxide scavenging, nitric oxide (NO) production, peroxynitrite (ONOO -) scavenging and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Regarding mechanisms, the quercetincontaining flavonoids QGR and QGG differentially targeted compared with quercetin in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway that inhibited the DNA binding activity of the NF-\u03baB complex without affecting the degradation and phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB phosphorylation. In addition, QGR and QGG inhibited CRE and activator protein (AP-1) transcriptional activity and JNK phosphorylation by inhibiting the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in a different manner than quercetin. Our results showed that although QGR and QGG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities than querce-tin in macrophages, their mechanisms of action in terms of the NF-\u03baB, PKA and PKC signaling pathways were different. al.,",

These molecules play important roles in cellular signaling and homeostasis, which protect the human body against bacteria and viruses. Immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils activated by either internal stimuli or environmental stressors, release excess amounts of ROS and RNS such as the superoxide radical anion (O 2 \u2022-), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), hydroxyl radical (OH \u2022 ), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and peroxynitrite (ONOO -) due to activation of NADH/NADPH oxidase, 5-lipoxygenase, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the mitochondria (Trachootham et al., 2008) . This may result in noxious effects on cells by direct interaction with cellular macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, lipids and proteins; the damage caused by the free radicals is reported in the etiology of several diseases (Lee and Kang, 2013; Rahman et al., 2012; Valko et al., 2007) .",

In addition, zymosan induces inflammatory signals by binding with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) after phagocytosis by macrophages, and the signals are prolonged because they are not degraded and can be enhanced by the use of mineral oil as a carrier (Sato et al., 2003) .",

In this study, we found that QGR and QGG exhibited significant stronger antioxidant activity compared with their aglycone core structure (quercetin) and their building blocks (quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid) in zymosanstimulated macrophages. In addition, both compounds exhibited anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), protein kinase A (PKA) and C (PKC) signaling pathways in zymosan-stimulated macrophages. However, the inhibitory action of QGR and QGG on their signaling was mediated by mechanisms distinct from those of quercetin.",

We therefore investigated whether quercetin and its structurally related compounds could affect NF-\u03baB signaling. We assayed SEAP expression as a measurement of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in RAW264.7 cells harboring the pNF-\u03baB-SEAP-NPT reporter construct, followed by incubation with various concentrations of each compound for 24 h in the presence or absence of zymosan. SEAP expression was increased by ~2.5-fold by stimulation with zymosan, indicating that cellular NF-\u03baB is transcriptionally activated and functional. QGR, QGG and quercetin inhibited NF-\u03baB-SEAP expression in a concentration-dependent manner, to as low as basal levels at high concentrations (100 \u03bcM). However, quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid had no effect on NF-\u03baB-SEAP expression compared with zymosan-stimulated cells (Fig. 7A) . The inhibition of zymosan-induced NF-\u03baB-SEAP expression was significantly stronger by PDTC treatment than with QGR, QGG or quercetin.",

            "text": "Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid compound that is distributed widely in nature and has a number of biological properties. Recently, quercetin has been used commercially to enhance blood vessel health and as an ingredient in numerous multivitamin preparations and herbal remedies in many countries. Quercitrin and isoquercitrin contain quercetin and either rhamnose or glucose as a glycoside, and QGR and QGG contain quercitrin or isoquercitrin as well as galloyl moieties as their building blocks. Thus QGR, QGG, quercitrin and isoquercitrin contain the quercetin moiety as the core structure. Previous studies have reported antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of quercitrin and isoquercitrin (Babujanarthanam et al., 2011; Camuesco et al., 2004; Jung et al., 2010; Rogerio et al., 2007) . QGR and QGG containing quercitrin or isoquercitrin and galloyl moieties have recently been isolated from Polygonum salicifolium and Persicaria lapathifolia (Calis et al., 1999; Park et al., 1999) ; however their properties have been investigated only minimally. In this study, we evaluated the antioxidant activities of QGR, QGG, quercetin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, and gallic acid. QGR and QGG exhibited stronger protective effects against oxidative stress than quercetin and a significantly stronger effect than quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid in zymosan-stimulated macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Antioxidant scavenging of free radicals is one of the defense mechanisms of the body. To prevent ROS-and RNS-mediated damage, the human body has multiple enzymatic antioxidant systems, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase (Irshad and Chaudhuri, 2002) . Low levels of ROS and RNS generated by natural byproducts are considered beneficial for the cellular immune response against invading microorganisms. However, excessive amounts of these molecules generated during oxidative stress have been implicated in various pathogenic conditions, and activate various signaling pathways through oxidation of reactive cysteine residues on specific target molecules. Therefore, regulation of the ROS-and RNS-generation systems and scavenging of the ROS and RNS generated is important for prevention of oxidative stress-related disorders. We assayed DPPH radical scavenging activity, superoxide production, superoxide scavenging activity, MPO activity, and NO and ONOOproduction in zymosan-stimulated macrophages to investigate the antioxidant activity of structurally quercetin-related flavonoids and gallic acid. QGR and QGG exhibited the greatest antioxidant potential as indicated by scavenging activity and inhibition of ROS and RNS production. Although quercetin also showed effective antioxidant activity, no peroxynitrite scavenging and MPO activities were observed. Quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid showed similar antioxidant potentials, which was lower than those of QGR, QGG and quercetin. In flavonoids, the 3\u20324\u2032-dihydroxy B-ring and hydroxyl group at position 3 of the C-ring are structurally important for antioxidant activity (Cao et al., 1997; Choi et al., 2002; Heijnen et al., 2001) . QGR and QGG contain either quercitrin or isoquercitrin and galloyl moieties in their structures, while quercitrin and isoquercitrin contain a quercetin moiety as well as a glycoside (rhamnose or glucose). Despite the importance of the phenolic hydroxyl groups of quercetin for the antioxidant activities of QGR and QGG, the galloyl moiety appears to play a more pivotal role as indicated by the significant increase in activity, even though the activity of gallic acid was either very low or nonexistent.",

Quercetin targets IKK\u03b1 phosphorylation, which is an upstream signal of NF-\u03baB, thereby inhibiting phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB activation, resulting in inhibition of the expression and production of pro-inflammatory mediators (Chen et al., 2005; Garc\u00eda-Mediavilla et al., 2007; Wadsworth and Koop, 1999) . Quercitrin and QGR also inhibit NF-\u03baB activation and iNOS expression, as well as NO production (Camuesco et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2005) . We found that quercetin inhibited iNOS expression by targeting the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in zymosan-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, indicating an upstream target of NF-\u03baB; this is consistent with other reports. However, QGR and QGG exhibited different NF-\u03baB-mediated mechanisms of inhibition of NO production and iNOS expression than quercetin. QGR and QGG inhibited DNA binding of the NF-\u03baB complex in the nucleus without affecting phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, whereas quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid did not inhibit NO production and iNOS expression. Therefore, gallic acid is essential for inhibition on the NF-\u03baB signaling by QGR and QGG, even though quercitrin and isoquercitrin do not affect this signaling.",

Of these, QGR, QGG and quercetin inhibited the transcriptional activities of CREB and AP-1. CREB is activated by cAMP/PKA signaling (Delghandi et al., 2005) and JNK activation is related to AP-1 signaling (Papachristou et al., 2003) . Quercetin inhibited cellfree PKA enzymatic activity, whereas QGG and QGR did not exhibit significant inhibitory effects on PKA activity. However, JNK phosphorylation was inhibited by quercetin, QGR and QGG. Similar to quercetin in NF-\u03baB signaling, the molecular targets of QGR and QGG in both the cAMP/PKA and JNK/AP-1 signaling pathways differed.

The NADPH oxidase complex is composed of the membrane-associated cytochrome B 558 and the cytoplasmic complex p40 phox , p47 phox and p67 phox (Babior, 1999) . PKC, specifically PKC\u03b4, is important for activation of the NADPH oxidase complex (Brown et al., 2003) . In addition, zymosan activates PKC via a receptor-mediated signaling pathway, and PMA is a direct activator of PKC in phagocytes ( Klebanoff and Headley, 1999; Liu and Heckman, 1998; Phillips et al., 1992) . Although quercetin, QGR and QGG effectively inhibited superoxide production in zymosan-or PMA-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, these compounds showed no significant inhibitory effects on PKC activity, suggesting prevention of the membrane-associated assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex, an event downstream of PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic p47 phox component that is similar to the NADPH oxidase-inhibitory mechanism of apocynin (Stolk et al., 1994) . Zymosan and PMA induce NADPH oxidase activation by phosphorylation of the p47 phox and activation of the Rac2 through signaling pathways of the protein tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K), PKC, ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases (Karlsson et al., 2000; Makni-Maalej et al., 2013; Raad et al., 2009 ). Our results indicated that strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of qurecetin, QGR and QGG than quercitrin, isoquercitrin and gallic acid resulted in regulation of the NADPH oxidase complex, specifically p47 phox .",
