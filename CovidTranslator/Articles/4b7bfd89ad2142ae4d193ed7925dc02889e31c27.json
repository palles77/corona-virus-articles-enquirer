The IPS was derived from alignments of Influenza genomes. The RNA segments of 5,133 influenza strains having diverse degree of relatedness were concatenated and aligned. After alignment, 9-mer sites having high Shannon entropy were searched. Additional criteria such as: G+C content between 35 to 65%, absence of dimer or trimer consecutive repeats, a minimum of 2 differences between 9mers and selecting only sequences with Tm values between 34.5 and 36.5oC were applied for selecting probes with high sequential entropy. Virtual Hybridization was used to predict Genomic Fingerprints to assess the capability of the IPS to discriminate between influenza and related strains. Distance scores between pairs of Influenza Genomic Fingerprints were calculated, and used for estimating Taxonomic Trees. Visual examination of both Genomic Fingerprints and Taxonomic Trees suggest that the IPS is able to discriminate between distant and closely related Influenza strains. It is proposed that the IPS can be used to investigate, by virtual or experimental hybridization, any new, and potentially virulent, strain.",

The viruses can exchange segments, leading to diversity of reassortant strains. Together with accumulation of point mutations, segment reassortment is the basis for evolution and maintenance of diversity for these viruses. It provides them with the ability to rapidly adapt to the pressure of the host immune system and leads to the continuous emergence of new virus variants that cause seasonal and pandemic outbreaks of influenza. Because of this ability, segmented viruses can exist in numerous genotypes and serotypes, presenting a challenge to the creation of protective vaccines and detection methods [1, 2] .",

Several molecular biology techniques, most of them based on PCR amplification, have contributed to the diagnostic of the different types and subtypes of influenza virus. However, PCR techniques are frequently unable to detect new potentially virulent strains. Other techniques such as sequencing are able to perform a precise The creation of a microarray is complicated when genomic structures are similar. Probe selection is further complicated when the number of known sequences is very large. When this happens the probe selection strategy becomes critical [5] . There are several methods [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] for the selection of specific probes for influenza virus detection. Direct search for probes based on traditional computational methods is labor-intensive and often requires plenty of time. The Shannon entropy (H), is a bioinformatics technique that has been used to sort the influenza virus, to analyze the evolution of influenza [13] , to facilitate the development of an anti-influenza vaccine [14] , and to create a profile of these areas of high variation, observing characteristic patterns for each subtype [15] .",

The VH programs conducts a rigorous and reliable analysis to find and track all the sites in each viral genome where the probe sequences can hybridize taking into account the degree of complementarity between the probe and the recognized site in the target (allowing at least a mismatch difference) and the thermodynamic stability between them. The generated information constitutes an in silico genomic fingerprint listing details of the specific sites in each target DNA where hybridization occurred, the number and sequence of the probe that hybridized as well as the free energy value of the hybridizations and it also provides the sequence of the target site recognized by each probe. A free energy cutoff value of -9 kcal/mol for 9mer probes was used. Figure 2 . It is clear that both viruses are very similar with only minor mutations, as expected for viruses from the same outbreak. However IPS genomic fingerprints are able to show seven differences between then, with five specific probes for A/M\u00e9xicoindre4487/2009 H1N1 virus and two for the A/California/04/2009.

Using as reference organism the virus A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009(H1N1 (in red) and A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (in green) to compare fingerprints.Evaluation of the genomic fingerprintThe analysis of the performance of our set of probes to distinguish between several viral sequences the in silico evaluation was divided into several steps: A) Viral Family Test: Two kinds of trees were calculated: One derived from the alignment of the concatenated fragments calculated with Clustal X 2.0 and the other resulting from the comparison of genomic fingerprints obtained with the IPS and VH. Both trees are derived from 12 different viral genome families including Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, which cause respiratory symptoms similar to influenza and several family Orthomixoviridae viruses like influenza B, influenza C, influenza A (H1N1, H1N2, H3N2) Thogotovirus and Isavirus are shown in(Figure 1).The comparison of the two trees shows a close correspondence. The tree from genomic fingerprints groups the influenza A (H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2) on a branch, influenza B, C and Isavirus in another branch and other viral families in other clusters. It is noteworthy that Human Respiratory Syncytial virus (which is a Paramyxovirus) was grouped with theRhinovirus Human Rhinovirus B, together with Thogotovirus in the tree based on genomic fingerprints. Thogotovirus has been classified as belonging to the Orthomixovirus family, although other studies make comparisons of Orthomyxoviridae PB1 proteins, showing low percentages of amino acid identity when compared with influenza viruses and Isavirus [22, 23]. Likewise, influenza virus types A, B and C yielded characteristic patterns for each virus, so IPS probes allowed creating distinctive fingerprints for each one and create one fingerprint characteristic for each virus (Figure 2). B) Hybridization of viral genomes of the same subtype was carried out on two subtypes of Influenza A H1N1, that infect different hosts (human and swine), to check if the IPS is able to generate distinctive genomic fingerprints. The virus A/New York/18/2006/H1N1 causes seasonal influenza whereas the virus A/ Swine/Wisconsin/1915/1988/H1N1 infects swine. It is highlighted that the IPS probes generated specific genomic fingerprints for each one. This result is very relevant showing that IPS is capable of an appropriated identification when there are outbreaks of this disease in humans by strains from animals such as pigs (Figure 2). C) Comparison of Genomic Fingerprints of two genomes with very high similarity. Overlapping Genomic Fingerprints of Influenza A H1N1 viruses A/M\u00e9xicoindre4487/2009 and A/California/04/2009 from the 2009 pandemics are shown in",
