Isatis indigotica has been used for the treatment of wounds, viral infections, and inflammation for centuries. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are found in all classes of life ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. To identify AMPs, I. indigotica was explored using a novel, sensitive, and high-throughput Bacillus subtilis screening system. We found that IiR515 and IiR915 exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against a variety of bacterial (Xanthomonas oryzae, Ralstonia solanacearum, Clavibacter michiganensis, and C. fangii) and fungal (Phytophthora capsici and Botrytis cinerea) pathogens. Scanning electron microscope and cytometric analysis revealed the possible mechanism of these peptides, which was to target and disrupt the bacterial cell membrane. This model was also supported by membrane fluidity and electrical potential analyses. Hemolytic activity assays revealed that these peptides may act as a potential source for clinical medicine development. In conclusion, the plant-derived novel AMPs IiR515 and IiR915 are effective biocontrol agents and can be used as raw materials in the drug discovery field.",

Multiresistant bacteria have many strategies that threaten the health of animals and plants [3] , such as beta-lactamases that are enzymes synthesized by bacteria to break host resistance [4] . This situation has been provoked by the recent attention paid to identifying new antimicrobial genes against emerging bacterial resistance [5] . Therefore, scientists have been trying to discover novel biocontrol agents to overcome this problem. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have received a considerable amount of attention because of their significant activity against fungi, bacteria, parasites, viruses, inflammation, and tumor cells [6, 7] . It is generally believed that AMPs are short peptides (20-50 amino acids) with low molecular weight and mostly linear cationic \u03b1-helices [8] , with effective activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens. AMPs can be isolated from a variety of organisms such as bacteria, fungi, insects, plants, animals, and humans [9, 10] . As a new class of antibiotic with low tendency to induce resistance, high antimicrobial activity, and good selectivity, AMPs have the potential to replace some traditional antibiotics in the future [11] . The Gram-positive bacterial cell envelope is composed of an outer cell wall (a thick peptidoglycan layer and a polysaccharide coat) and an inner cytoplasmic membrane. To achieve their bactericidal activities, AMPs interact with the cell wall or cytomembrane, resulting in membrane interruption and cell lysis [12] . In most of these cases, AMPs are reported to cause disruptions in cell wall or cell membrane integrity, perforation, deformation, and increased water ion and molecular flow across the membrane, which ultimately causes microbial death [13] .",

Based on this assumption, cells with abnormal growth were identified and their inserts were considered to be potential antimicrobial genes ( Figure 1 ). The lengths of the inserts were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ( Figure S2) , and the quality of the cDNA library was determined based on the primary library titer and recombination rate, which were 5.6 \u00d7 10 6 CFU/mL (Colony Forming Units per milliliter) and 90.27%, respectively. During initial screening, a total of 2.20% of clones (45/2039) demonstrated killing effects on B. subtilis, and among them, 15 clones showed strong antimicrobial activities. These results suggested that the inserted fragments in those 15 clones coded for products with the potential to inhibit or kill microorganisms (Table S2 ). Based on this screening, IiR515 and IiR915 were selected for further study.",

From the SEM results, the control B. subtilis WB800-e strain showed normal and intact cell morphology. By contrast, membrane damage, such as membrane holes, deformation, and lysis, was observed in cells transformed with the IiR515 and IiR915 genes (Figure 2a ). Cell staining was observed by confocal imaging. Under an ordinary optical microscope, rod-shaped bacterial cells were observed for both the control and transformed strains ( Figure 2b ). However, images under a fluorescence microscope were different; red fluorescence was not observed for B. subtilis WB800-e (control), whereas obvious red rod-shaped IiR515and IiR915-transformed bacteria were observed (Figure 2c ). Propidium iodide (PI) uptake increases with an increase in cell membrane permeability. Dot plots showed that the B. subtilis WB800-e strain had minimal PI staining (approximately 1.75%). Conversely, the PI fluorescent signal for the transgenic strains was much stronger, approximately 88.4% for IiR515 and 96.9% for IiR915 (Figure 2d ). The y-axis shows the intensity of scattered light, which also increased with increased PI fluorescence signal (x-axis). All of these results showed that the intact cell membrane of wild-type Bacillus rejected the infiltration of PI. By contrast, PI infiltration into the IiR515and IiR915-transformed cells occurred because of their incomplete cell membranes and PI bound to their exposed nucleic acids, resulting in the observation of red fluorescence. Our results revealed that the cell membrane was significantly destroyed, ultimately leading to cell death.",

A drawback of this strategy is that strong AMPs will kill B. subtilis cells too rapidly to detect the clones, and therefore, only AMPs with weak killing effects are preferred. However, B. subtilis has a good secretory system, which may reduce the toxicity of strong AMPs. Additionally, during the first few hours (12 h), the concentration of strong AMPs is possibly not high enough to kill the cells, making the selection of strong AMPs feasible. In our study, part of the B. subtilis system selected AMPs that did not actually show a strong effect on B. subtilis cells; however, the selected AMPs did show strong antimicrobial activity against other pathogens. Although the selection of AMPs with weak killing effects is preferred, the B. subtilis screening system has the ability to select for cell membrane-interrupting antimicrobial peptides that inhibit a broad range of pathogens. This strategy was used for the screening of AMPs from the Chinese herbal plant, I. indigotica, which was previously reported for its high antimicrobial activities [46] and other health-related benefits [47] . In this study, we identified 45 different candidates from I. indigotica with the potential to induce autolysis of Bacillus cells. Out of the 45 candidates, two different peptides, IiR515 and IiR915, that exhibited strong antimicrobial activities were selected for further study. These two peptides were considered to be novel because they had no homology in NCBI BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches or the antimicrobial peptide database (APD) ( Figure S4 ).",

Cytometric analysis of IiR515and IiR915-transformed Bacillus cells showed the same results and were supported by previous studies [50] . Propidium iodide can penetrate broken cell membranes and cause the majority of cells to emit red fluorescence. Cytomembrane breakage always accompanies intracellular component outflow, such as nucleic acids, which can be detected in the extracellular environment. Cell membrane damages also correlate with membrane fluidity and changes in electrical potential, as our results show. We treated the genomes of different pathogens with these peptides, but they did not cause DNA degradation.

Bacillus subtilis 168 is the most popular host for the expression of heterogenous proteins, and it is a biocontrol agent [52] that can secrete many extracellular proteases to degrade extracellular proteins.

Many of the methods require PCR amplification to increase the abundance of cDNAs.

Similarly, the MIC for AMP CAP-1 from Pseudomonas sp. ranged from 30 to 550 \u00b5g/mL against a wide range of pathogens [36, 54] . Minimum inhibitory concentration for our peptides revealed that they were similar to the previously reported AMPs.

Phytophthora capsici is a pathogenic oomycete which is hemi-biotrophic and has a broad range of hosts. It can infect most of the Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae crops [56] . Disks containing P. capsici were used to inoculate N. benthamiana leaves for pathogenicity analysis by observation of necrotic lesions [57] . Our results demonstrated that IiR515 and IiR915 enhanced the resistance of N. benthamiana towards P. capsici. These two peptides were then ligated into the pTRV 2 Ex (viral vector) vector, and we observed that they had the potential to improve the resistance of N. benthamiana towards B. cinerea. Previous studies have shown that the use of viral vectors can produce a huge quantity of AMPs in plant systems to efficiently reduce pathogen attack [58] , as was observed in our study.",
