The spread of COVID-19 reached the epidemiological criteria to declared pandemic, and on March 11th 2020, with more than 118,000 cases in 114 2 countries, and 4,291 deaths, the WHO have officially confirmed it [2] . A Chinese report have already revealed that cancer patients have an increased risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19, compared to non-cancer population [3] . Although with substantial differences, the challenges which cancer care professionals have to face with during a pandemic are quite similar to those posed by natural disasters. [4] . Flexibility, understood as the ability to quickly adapt to changing situations, represents the fundamental tool for overcoming critical issues. During the 2009 tragic earthquake of central Italy, some of us were serving at an oncological home care service in L'Aquila, the city which was more hardly hit. At that time, we had no available literature data nor previously published experiences related to oncological home care during natural disasters. Therefore, we based our activity on two main empirical principles: to maintain the continuity of care as much as possible, and to adapt our operating procedures according to the circumstances [5] .",

First, the risk for the patients of being infected, which can lead to severe and life-threatening forms of CODIV-19. Secondly, the risk for the health care professionals of being infected. All the figures involved have to be very careful and standardized processes might be helpful. During the current CODIV-19 pandemic, we are supporting the Tuscany Tumor Association (ATT), a charity with a twenty-year experience, which provides oncological home care in the cities of Florence, Prato and Pistoia, in Italy. At the beginning of the outbreak, ATT was following an average of 300 patients per day, 40% of whom were still on disease-oriented treatment, and by the first days of March 2020, the infection spread had already hit the served area. We have established a \"double triage\" protocol; our goals were ensuring the continuity of care and to protect the health care professionals from the infection. The first triage is a telephone interview, performed by a dedicated nurse the day before the scheduled home visit. This step is obviously focused on identifying patients who might have even mild forms of COVID-19. The nurse ask to each patient if within the previous 48 hours: 1) he/she have experienced fever, breathlessness or cough; 2) he/she (or his/her relatives) have recently been to known outbreak areas; 3) he/she have had direct contact with people known to have COVID-19; 4) he/she have had direct contact with people currently in quarantine. The same questionnaire is addressed to the patient relatives and/or cohabiters. Patients whit a positive first triage are referred to 3 the general practitioner, to follow the procedures established by the national health system [6] .",
