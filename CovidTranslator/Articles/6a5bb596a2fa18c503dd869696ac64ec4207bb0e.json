These include many potentially pathogenic organisms, as well as a wide variety of other non-replicating antigens such as food proteins and other immunogenic materials. These features predict that IEL have an important role in protecting the intestinal mucosa against invading antigens. Furthermore, an increased proportion of IEL is a characteristic feature of the pathology of many small intestinal disorders, suggesting that these lymphocytes may also be involved in producing enteropathy.",

This is particularly true of human IEL, where difficulties are increased by the limited availability of tissue samples of appropriate size and origin. Furthermore, many studies of isolated \"IEL\" in man have used populations of \"mucosal lymphocytes\", rather than wellcharacterised preparations of pure IEL and are, thus, impossible to interpret. In this review, I shall describe the features and possible biological functions of IEL, with particular reference to their roles in health and disease. Although I shall concentrate on IEL from human small intestine, where appropriate I shall refer to studies using animal IEL. Finally, as many features of human IEL have been reviewed in the fairly recent past [28, 31] , I shall emphasise more recent findings on the phenotype and functions of these cells.",

In man and laboratory rodents, IEL are distributed widely and relatively evenly throughout the small intestine. Large numbers of epithelial lymphocytes also occur in the stomach, colon and rectum, although there may be less IEL in more distal parts of the gut [28] . Similar cells have been described in other epithelial tissues, including bronchus, breast and the urogenital tract. Most of these populations of IEL have not been studied in any detail and their relationship to small bowel IEL is unknown. However, as I shall describe, evidence is accumulating that epithelial lymphocytes may form a discrete compartment of the immune system.",

Virtually all IEL lie on the basement membrane (BM) between the enterocytes and are never found within epithelial cells (Fig. 2) , although in disease states, IEL may be found closer to the luminal surface of the epithelium [30] . There are no desmesomes or tight junctions between IEL and surrounding enterocytes and cytoplasmic extrusions from IEL can often be seen pushing their way through the intercellular space between adjacent epithelial cells [77] . It has been suggested that rarely an entire IEL may move into the lumen and attach to potentially invasive organisms [93] , but this concept is difficult to prove directly.",

The nature of these granules has not been determined with certainty and has provoked considerable speculation over the origin and lineage of IEL. Apparently lysosomal in nature, the granules stain metachromatically with Astra blue or toluidine blue at low pH, contain sulphur-containing glycosaminoglycans [38, 41, 95] and appear to be associated with serine esterase activity [41] . Although these features initially suggested that IEL were part of the unusual population of mast cells found in the intestinal mucosa [38] , there is now considerable evidence that IEL and mucosal mast cells (MMC) are distinct [41, 95, 101] . Furthermore, MMC precursors are rare among IEL [101] .",

            "text": "The source of IEL precursors and their routes of migration to the epithelium have not yet been proven conclusively. Animal studies show that Peyer's patches are necessary for the normal reconstitution of IEL populations [38] , while radiolabelled T lymphoblasts from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and thoracic duct lymph (TDL) may localise in the epithelium after recirculating through blood [78, 108] . This pathway is similar to that described for the recruitment of IgAcommitted B lymphocytes into the intestinal lamina propria (LP) and would suggest that IEL derive from antigen-reactive precursors in the Peyer's patches (Fig. 3) . Whatever the original source of IEL, clearly these cells must ultimately traverse the LP before entering the epithelium. This is shown clearly in electron microscopy (EM) studies which observe IEL breaking through the BM into the epithelial layer (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, recent elegant studies of immunologically induced enteropathy in human gut in vitro have shown that activation of LP lymphocytes is paralleled by reconstitution of IEL numbers [79] . These findings make the fact that IEL and LP lymphocytes comprise very different populations all the more surprising (see below). The fate of IEL is unclear and remains controversial. As noted above, most IEL have a short life-span within the epithelium, although some may remain for much longer periods [67, 98] . That IEL are merely lost into the lumen, possibly by migrating up the villus with the enterocyte sheet has never been shown directly and is probably inconsistent with the predominantly basal position of IEL within the epithelium. Furthermore, even IEL near the enterocyte extrusion zone at the villus tip show none of the signs of degeneration which might be expected in an effete population [22, 70] . Thus, it seems more likely that IEL leave the epithelium by re-entering the LP, an idea which is supported by EM studies appearing to show IEL breaking the BM in the direction of the LP [113] . The ultimate fate of IEL after leaving the epithelium is entirely unknown. Despite initial evidence to the contrary [38] , detailed studies in mice show that isolated IEL have no capacity to return to the mucosa by recirculating through blood and lymphoid tissues [2] . Therefore, it must be assumed that IEL either die in the LP or use less conventional routes of migration to re-enter lymphoid tissues. Intriguing, but uncorfirmed, observations in chickens suggest that parasite-infected IEL may indeed return to the peripheral immune system, perhaps supporting the view that IEL continue to function for some time after leaving the epithelium [57] .",

Very low numbers of IEL are found under germ-free conditions [8, 28, 97] and a depresse d IEL count has even been reported in normal individuals placed on a milk-free diet [96] . As IEL and their precursors exhibit normal turnover kinetics in germ-free rodents [98] , and IEL precursors migrate normally into germ-free intestine [28] , the low numbers of IEL seems to reflect a lack of local factors which normally retain recirculating lymphocytes in the gut wall.

            "text": "T Lymphocyte Markers on IEL. As noted earlier, there is considerable evidence that many, if not virtually all, IEL are thymus-dependent lymphocytes. This is supported by the uniform findings that IEL from all species contain virtually no slg + B lymphocytes and by the absence of macrophages [22] . Furthermore, initial studies using human T lymphocyte-specific monoclonal antibodies showed that 95 % or more IEL carried the CD3 marker which is associated with the T cell receptor (TcR) on all T cells [102, 103] . This finding has since been amply confirmed by many other workers [9, 13, 36, 45, 46, 65, 107] . The lack, until recently, of equivalent CD3-specific reagents has prevented similar studies in other species, but it has been reported that 85 %-90 % of mouse IEL are CD3 \u00f7 [35] . Interestingly,in our own work, we have found that mouse IEL seem to express less CD3 than conventional T lymphocytes (I. N. Crispe & A. McI. Mowat, unpublished observations). Many of the other phenotypic features of IEL also distinguish them from conventional populations of T lymphocytes (Table 1) . Although most IEL express some markers which are found as pan T cell antigens on other T cells, including CD2 [11, 13, 23, 36] , other pan T cell markers are absent from a significant proportion of IEL including CD5 [7, 13, 46, 65, 103] , Thy-1 in mice [19, 20, 26, 51, 94] and W3/13 in rats [61] . In mice, IEL also do not carry the MEL 14 antigen found on mature recirculating T cells [58] .",

Whereas T lymphocytes from peripheral blood and most other lymphoid tissues have a CD4 \u00f7 : CD8 \u00f7 ratio of around 2 : 1, [102, t03] . This large population of CD8 \u00a7 IEL accounts for most of the aberrant expression of other, pan T cell markers, with up to 70% of human CD8 \u00a7 IEL being CD5 - [13, 65, 103] and around 50% of murine IEL are CD8 \u00a7 Thy-1 - [9, 20, 26, 51, 94] . In contrast, CD4 \u00a7 IEL seem to express other T cell markers (normally) although some workers have reported a small proportion of CD4 \u00a7 CD5 -cells [9] . Although CD8 \u00a7 T cells from other tissues do not usually share this defective expression of pan T cell markers, some CD8 \u00a7 LP lymphocytes do show similar features [65, 103] , while CD8 \u00a7 C D 5 -T cells have been described in the skin of patients with graft-versus-host (GvH) disease [44] and in rejecting renal allografts [6] . Interestingly, athymic mice have CD8 \u00a7 but no CD4 + IEL, suggesting that at least some CD8 \u00a7 IEL may be thymus independent [52, 54, 59] . Nevertheless, the low number o f l E L in such animals indicates that this population is likely to be small under normal conditions.",

            "text": "Recent studies have suggested that the unusual phenotype of IEL may reflect the presence of a discrete population of T cells with a distinct developmental lineage. Thus, it has been reported that murine and chicken CD8 \u00a7 IEL express the 3'6 form of the TcR for antigen, which is rarely found on mature T lymphocytes and is normally restricted to developing thymocytes [4, 7, 35] . Interestingly, T cells in skin epidermis also use the 3\"~i TcR and these findings have led to the hypothesis that 3,5 \u00a7 IEL are part of a primitive population of effector T cells whose function is to protect the superficial layers of the body, including the skin, gut and respiratory tract [43, 109] . However, it should be noted that murine IEL express a family of 3,5 receptors which is different to that employed by either thymic or skin 3~ \u00a7 T cells [4] , suggesting that IEL may be a unique family of T cells. It is important to emphasise that most of these immunochemical studies have yet to be confirmed and they contrast with phenotypic work on IEL. Thus, 5 % of less of human IEL have the CD3 \u00a7 CD4-CD8-phenotype normally associated with 3,~ + T cells in other sites ( Fig. 4 ; [13, 45, 46, 107] ) and >90% of human CD3 \u00a7 IEL carry the WT31 marker which characterises mature T cells with the conventional a13 TcR [13] . Furthermore, we have found that the proportion of murine IEL (including CD8 \u00a7 IEL) which express the V~8 and Va6 families of ot13 TcR is almost the same as that in other T cell populations. Together, these findings do not support the view that most IEL are 3'5 \u00a7 T cells. Nevertheless, a small (< 10%) proportion of human IEL are CD3 \u00a7 CD4 -CD8 -T cells and a similar number have been reported to be WT31 -and to express the \"r6 receptor [13, 45, 46, 107] . In addition, it has been suggested that Thy-1 -IEL in mice may contain a lower than normal proportion of ot13 + T cells, while Thy-1 \u00a7 IEL are normal in this respect [114] . Our own results also indicate that murine CD8 \u00a7 IEL may express less or/3 TcR than other CD8 \u00a7 T cells. Thus, the true frequency of different TcR among IEL remains unclear. It will be an important goal of future research to investigate the T cell lineage of IEL, using appropriate molecular biological and immunological techniques. In particular, it will be of interest to determine the relationship between CD8 \u00a7 IEL and the rare population of peripheral CD8 \u00a7 T cells which has recently been described in man and which appears to represent a distinct subset of 3,5 + T lymphocytes [80] .",

            "text": "Activation Markers on IEL. Many morphological features of IEL are consistent with a degree of activation in situ and several investigators have looked for the presence of phenotypic markers of activation on IEL. Most of these studies have been negative, as IEL do not express conventional T cell activation markers, including the interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor (Tac; CD25) [45, 58] , class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (HLA-DP, DR, DQ) [9, 11, 13, 45, 46, 65, 102, 103] , transferrin receptors (CD9) [65] or T10 [9] . Nevertheless, some phenotypic features are not consistent with IEL being entirely a resting population ofT cells. A variable proportion of human IEL express the CD7 marker normally associated with activated T lymphocytes and this is most marked among CD8 + IEL [65, 107] . In addition, 50%-60% of murine IEL express the CT1 carbohydrate epitope of the T200 common leucocyte antigen, which is rarely found on resting peripheral T cells, but is present on many activated T cells, particularly those with cytotoxic activity [51, 58] . More recently, these results have been supported by the fact that an IEL-specific monoclonal antibody, M290, seems to recognise an unusual form of the T200 molecule [50] and by the finding that most human IEL carry the UCHL-1 marker which is an epitope of the T200 molecule expressed primarily on differentiated memory T cells (J. Spencer and T. T. Mac-Donald, personal communication). These features indicate that IEL may have already interacted with antigen before entering the epithelium.",

The preceding sections show clearly that the vast majority of IEL are T lymphocytes of undefined nature, but many studies have also identified a small population oflEL which do not express the CD3 marker (see above). Some of these CD3-cells express other pan T cell markers [44, 107] , while others will be the eosinophils, mast cells and macrophages rarely found in the epithelium. Despite the similarity between the morphology of IEL and the LGL which mediate NK cell activity in other sites, NK cell markers such as Leu-7 (HNK-1), NKH-1 (Leu- 19) or the FcRIII receptor (CD16, Leu-llb) are almost never found on human IEL [1, 9, 23, 36, 45, 46, 103] . However, 15%-20% of mouse IEL express the asialo GM1 molecule [8, 112] which is often considered specific for rodent NK cells and I shall return to the issue of NK-active IEL in a later section. One final phenotypic peculiarity of IEL comes from recent reports that not all IEL carry LFA-l-related antigens found on most other lymphocytes [13, 58] .",

This antibody, HML-1 labels virtually all IEL, irrespective of their morphology and expression of the other lymphocyte markers described above [13, 45] . Few cells in other tissues are HML-1 \u00a7 although many of the CD3 \u00a7 lymphocytes found in the epithelium of the breast, bronchus and uterus are HML-1 \u00a7 underlining the possible relationship between IEL in different mucosae. Approximately 40 % of LP lymphocytes are also HML-1 \u00a7 and interestingly, most of these are CD8 \u00a7 as were the 20% HML-1 \u00a7 cells found in foetal decidua. These findings indicate that HML-1 identifies a predominantly CD8 \u00a7 population of lymphocytes which may localise preferentially in epithelia. The molecule recognised by HML-1 is a heterodimer with chains of molecular mass 105 kDa and 150 kDa [13] and is characteristic of one of the \"integrin\" molecules which are believed to mediate adhesion between cells in vivo. Thus, HML-1 may be a cell surface marker which enables IEL to interact within the surrounding epithelium. This may act in two ways. First, HML-1 could appear only after IEL enter the epithelium and so its function would be to retain IEL in this site. Alternatively, as HML-1 is expressed on MLN lymphoblasts, this molecule may direct the migration of IEL precursors to the epithelium. Another recently described monoclonal antibody has an almost identical pattern of specificity for murine IEL, CD8 \u00a7 LP lymphocytes and some TDL blasts [50] . As this M290 antibody also recognised an integrin-line molecule, these findings underline the possible importance of cell surface adhesion molecules in regulating the appearance of CD8 \u00a7 T cells in the epithelium. The development of further IEL-specific monoclonal antibodies will be of considerable help in defining the nature and origins of these cells.",

For these reasons, I shall confine my attention principally to animal work and will include only those human reports which used weU-characterised populations of IEL.",

            "text": "Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) Functions. The large number of CD8 \u00a7 IEL of granular morphology would be consistent with the presence of many CTL. It is exceedingly difficult to examine for CTL function in man, but allospecific CTL appear rapidly in the LP and epithelium of mice immunised with allogeneic tumour cells [17, 52, 87] . Interestingly, CTL are found among IEL after either oral or parenteral immunisation and under these circumstances, IEL have as much or more CTL activity than cells from conventional lymphoid tissues. Paradoxically, more detailed in vitro studies have shown a low frequency of CTL precursors among IEL and most of these belong to the small population of Thy-1 \u00a7 CD8 \u00a7 IEL [26, 27] . These findings suggest that individual CTL among IEL may have very high lytic activity on a cell for cell basis and may indicate that cytotoxic IEL have been pre-activated in situ. This idea is supported by the fact that IEL share many features of cloned CTL, including their morphology, the presence of the murine CT1 antigen and their marked tendency to lose specificity during culture in vitro [53] . In addition, the asialo GMI marker found on 15%-20% IEL may also be expressed by activated CTL [110] . Finally, compared with CD8 \u00a7 lymphocytes from other tissues, resting mouse IEL seem to be more readily activated to exhibit CTL activity after stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody [35] . Helper/suppressor T cell activity IFN Interferon; IL interleukin; GM-CSF granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor; DTH delayed-type-hypersensitivity; NK natural killer Natural Cytotoxicity by IEL. NK cell-specific markers are virtually absent from human IEL (see above) and human IEL show no NK activity against conventional lymphoid tumour cell targets in conventional short-term assays, even when stimulated by IL 2 or interferon (IFN) [9, 90] . Although a similar lack of resting NK cell activity has been described in IEL from most other species [8, 34, 58, 86, 95, 114, 117] , IEL seem to contain a large number of cells which can bind to NK cell targets [34] and can express excellent NK activity if extended assays are used [14, 78, 79, 111] . In addition, IEL from mice immunised with allogeneic tumour cells or with GvH reaction (R) have enhanced NK activity, even in shortterm assays [5, 87] . Finally, it has been shown that murine IEL may have nonspecific short-term lyric activity against target cells infected with the enteric pathogen, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). This activity was non-antigen-specific and due to Thy-1 -CD8 -IEL and so did not reflect the degenerate CTL described above [8] . Similar non-specific cytotoxicity against Giardia trophozoites has been noted using mouse IEL [48] and against a crypt cell line using rat IEL [40] . Thus, IEL may mediate non-specific cytotoxicity directed at target structures different from those recognised by conventional NK cells, such as pathogens or intestinal cells themselves. In later sections, I shall describe evidence that IEL NK cells may be important in certain forms of local immunopathology.",

Although some positive responses have been reported using IEL from some animal species, they are usually much smaller than those obtained with lymphocytes from other tissues [19, 20, 116, 120] . Human IEL bind the polyclonal mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) normally [36] and the lack of accessory cells among IEL preparations does not seem to account for their defective responses. Although we and others have found that addition of adherent accessory cells can enhance the response of IEL to mitogens or alloantigens [19, 88] , the resulting responses remain poor and others have not found similar effects [36] . Furthermore, mouse IEL show very little response to phorbol ester and calcium ionophore, agents which activate all lymphocytes maximally in the absence of accessory cells [89] . This poor proliferative capacity appears mainly to be a property of CD8 \u00a7 IEL [89] and there is a very low frequency of Con A-responsive CD8 \u00a7 IEL compared with CD8 \u00a7 spleen cells [20] .

Although IEL produce little or no IL 2 in response to mitogens or alloantigens [12, 20, 23 117] addition of exogenous IL 2 does not raise their proliferative response to anywhere near normal levels. Furthermore, IEL produce adequate amounts of IL 2 when optimally stimulated with phorbol ester and ionophore or via the CD2 antigen [23, 89] . The defective proliferative response of IEL, therefore, appears to reflect an absence of IL 2-responsive IEL, particularly within the CD8 \u00a7 population. As peripheral CD8 \u00a7 T cells frequently respond very efficiently to IL 2 [25] , this again emphasises the unusual nature of CD8 \u00a7 IEL. One intriguing study in man suggests that it may be possible to overcome this proliferative defect by activating IEL through the CD2 molecule. In this work, IEL normally made no response to several polyclonal mitogens, but excellent proliferation could be obtained in presence of sheep red blood cells (SRBC) [23] . This effect could be blocked by antibodies against the CD2 marker, which forms the receptor for SRBC found on human T cells. Equivalent CD2-specific reagents have not been available to confirm this report in other species. However, these findings could indicate that IEL have unusual requirements for proliferation, either due to inherent differences in cellular metabolism or perhaps due to their particular level of differentiation in situ.",

However, the limited studies which have been performed on T s activity by IEL argue against this idea. Human IEL do not suppress PHA responses by PBL [23] and have only a moderate ability to suppress polyclonal Ig production by pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-stimulated PBL, identical to that found using PBL [36] . Furthermore, work in rats showed that IEL could not transfer the tolerant state when taken from animals fed ovalbumin. This contrasted with the transferable, antigen-specific Ts activity found in Peyer's patch cells in the same experiments [62] . Thus, there is no evidence at present that IEL are enriched for Ts.",

As with IEL mediating CTL activity, DTH effector cells appeared in IEL after both oral and parenteral immunisation with protein antigens (Fig. 6) [104] . The ability of IEL to transfer DTH was greater than that found in other intestinal lymphoid tissues and was almost as potent as that found in peripheral lymph nodes draining a site into syngeneic recipients. The DTH response is measured by the increase in footpad thickness 24 h after cell transfer and the specific activity is the response with OVA less that without OVA immunised with adjuvant (Fig. 6) . Although the poor yield of isolated IEL has limited further studies of this type, mouse IEL have also been found to produce a local GvHR in the popliteal lymph node after transfer into the footpad of semiallogeneic hosts [2, 19] . This local GvHR reflects non-specific activation and recruitment of host cells similar to that found in a DTH reaction, supporting the in vitro evidence that IEL are capable of secreting lymphokines.",

This observation has since been amply confirmed and similar increases in IEL/100 epithelial cells have been reported in cow's milk protein intolerance, giardiasis, tropical sprue, dermatitis herpetiformis and in the active lesions of Crohn's disease [24, 28, 54-56, 73, 96, 99, 119] .

These objections are based on the fact that the villus atrophy found in the relevant disorders leads to a decreased number of enterocytes and, hence, produces an apparent increase in the IEL : enterocyte ratio. Indeed, when IEL are enumerated with reference to a constant area or volume of mucosa, their absolute number is actually decreased in e.g. coeliac disease [16, 68, 71, 91] . Nevertheless, it should be noted that increased ratios of IEL are found in experimental enteropathies in the absence of enterocyte loss (see below), while an increased absolute IEL count has been observed in the crypts of patients with established coeliac disease and more generally, soon after gluten challenge [59, 71, 72] . These features indicate that a direct role for IEL cannot be dismissed simply on numerical grounds. Furthermore, the enumeration of IEL with respect to enterocytes remains the simplest and most rapid means of assessing this population. The results obtained provide useful diagnostic information even in the presence of villus atrophy and, in its absence, may provide an accurate estimate of the absolute size of the population.",

Furthermore, IEL retain the IEL-specific marker HML-1 [107] and virtually all continue to be CD3 + T cells [46, 107] with no infiltration by NK cells [1, 46, 103] . However, some subtle phenotypic changes have been detected in coeliac IEL, with an increased expression of CD5 by CD8 + IEL and an increased number of IEL expressing the T2 blast antigen [46, 65, 103] .

The infiltrating IEL have an increased mitotic activity [29] and appear to derive from precursors in Peyer's patches [38] . In general, their phenotype mirrors that of normal IEL, although there may be a loss of IEL-specific markers [39, 50] . It seems that host IEL are recruited nonspecifically by the anti-host DTH response which characterises the early phase of GvHR. As IEL from mice with GvHR and T. spiralis infection have been found to secrete IFN-3,, IL 3 and IL 2 [21, 39] , it is possible that activated IEL contribute to the intestinal pathology by releasing the mediators thought to be important for this form of enteropathy [29, 82] . An alternative role for IEL is suggested by their increased NK activity in mice with GvHR [5] and interestingly, depletion of NK ceils in vivo not only prevents intestinal GvHR but reduces the IEL count [81] . Although these findings contrast with the lack of NK cells in the epithelium of patients with coeliac disease, the experimental studies do indicate some of the functions which might warrant investigation under clinical conditions. IEL in Malignancy. Primary tumours of the small intestine are rare and studies of the IEL present in carcinomas of the stomach or colon reveal few alterations in appearance or function [45] . Nevertheless, it has recently become apparent that the small bowel tumours once referred to as \"malignant histiocytosis of the intestine\" are in fact T cell lymphomas which arise from IEL. The malignancy frequently originates in the epithelium and the tumour cells are granulated T cells [42, 100] , which express CD7 and the IEL-specific marker HML-1 [100] . They frequently express CD3, but not CD4 or CD8 [100, 106] and, hence, their phenotype is remarkably similar to that of the abnormal IEL which inf'lltrate the epithelium in coeliac disease. These T cell lymphomas produce an identical pattern of enteropathy to coeliac disease and it has long been suspected that the two conditions are related. This idea is supported by the recent demonstration that CD4-CD8-HML-1 \u00a7 IEL are abundant in unaffected intestine of patients with both coeliac disease and T cell lymphoma [107] and it may be that these rare tumours may help understand the role of IEL in several clinical enteropathies.",

As one of these conditions is intestinal parasite infections, the question arises as to whether IEL are involved in protective responses against local pathogens. Their close proximity to luminal antigens certainly makes IEL ideal candidates for such a function and increased IEL counts are found in several human infectious disorders, including giardiasis and tropical sprue. One report suggested that IEL may actually leave the epithelium to attack giardia trophozoites [93] but this has not been confirmed in other conditions and its significance is unclear. The ways in which IEL could mediate protective immunity are also unknown, but, as noted above, murine IEL have been found to have potent NK activity against the enteric virus, MHV. When these NK-active IEL are depleted in vivo, viral clearance is markedly inhibited, implying an important role for IEL NK cells in the anti-viral response [8] . It would be of interest to examine for other specific and non-specific functions of IEL from clinical and experimental infections.",

Many IEL have the appearance of LGL but few have the phenotype of NK cells and their resting NK activity is low. Similarly, it is now clear that virtually all IEL are CD3 + T lymphocytes, but there are many differences between IEL and other T cell populations, including those in the LP. Almost 75 % of IEL are CD8 \u00a7 and many of these do not express certain pan T cell markers found on conventional T lymphocytes. IEL do not recirculate through lymphoid tissues in vivo [2] , normally do not produce IL 2, and have little or no proliferative capacity in vitro. They can act as specific CTL, may mediate local DTH responses and can secrete certain lymphokines, including IL 3 and IFN-'y. Finally, recent studies indicate that IEL express specific surface markers not found on most other lymphocytes and in some species IEL may use a form of the TcR differing from that expressed by normal, mature T cells. This latter finding has been interpreted as evidence that IEL belong to a family of primitive epithelial T cells which use the \"g6 TcR and whose function is to defend body surfaces such as the skin, gut and respiratory tract. This is an attractive hypothesis which deserves further investigation. Nevertheless, it should be emphasised that the function ofT/~ \u00a7 T cells is entirely unknown. Current evidence indicates that the \"y6 TcR is expressed mainly on developing T cells and has extremely limited diversity of recognition. Thus, it is difficult to envisage how IEL using this TcR could be of use in mediating efficient immune responses against the wide range of antigens likely to be encountered in the gut. Finally, we and others have been unable to confirm the high proportion of \"r8 TcR among human or murine IEL and this question will obviously be the focus for much work in the near future.",

As IEL are not in mitosis and do not express activation markers such as IL 2 receptors and MHC class 1I molecules, they are clearly not true lymphoblasts. Rather, we propose that IEL are the T lymphocyte equivalent of plasma cells and are end-stage effector cells which have differentiated fully before entering the epithelium. As a result and, as has been reported, IEL would not be capable of further proliferation when restimulated with mitogens, but would mediate effector functions such as CTL activity, DTH responses or secretion of inflammatory mediators. According to this hypothesis, the increased numbers of activated IEL in local disease means they have an important role as immune effector cells. We would predict that IEL are recruited non-specifically by other local T cells during such responses and that their function is to amplify, rather than initiate mucosal immune reactions. These possibilities remain to be investigated at the cellular level. Two alternative, but highly speculative, roles of IEL remain to be considered (Table 5 ). First, IEL may have been functionally inactivated by a first encounter with antigen, either because of their expression of unusual TcR or because of inappropriate antigen presentation within the mucosa. Small bov~el enterocytes have the ability to express MHC class II antigens and there is some evidence that Ia \u00a7 enterocytes may be able to act as accessory cells for T cells [3, 74] . Recent studies indicate that when MHC class N-expressing tissue cells from skin or pancreas present antigen to normal T cells, full T cell activation does not occur, probably due to the inability of tissue cells to produce all the accessory signals normally required for T cell growth [47] . T cells treated in this way show some signs of partial activation, including morphological alterations and production of IL 3 and IFN-3,, but not IL 2. These cells are then unresponsive to further stimulation with antigen. It is tempting to speculate that IEL are locked in a similar state of partial activation in situ and that this lympho-epithelial compartment has evolved to prevent harmful hypersensitivity reactions within this important tissue. The increased number of IEL in disease may, therefore, reflect an attempt by the local immune system to inhibit local immune responses by flooding the area with anergic lymphocytes. As with previous suggestions that MHC class H-expressing enterocytes may activate a population of CD8 + T s among IEL [3, 74] , this hypothesis has to be reconciled with the dogma that a CD8 + population such as IEL should not recognise antigen in the context of MHC class II molecules. Furthermore, it does not explain how the epithelial lymphoid system can differentiate between beneficial antigens such as foods and other, more harmful ones, such as pathogens. Nevertheless, the relationship between IEL and surrounding enterocytes is an intriguing area for future investigation.",

Most IEL are clearly TDL which are influenced markedly by the presence of local antigen. Nevertheless, the presence of a variable number of IEL with the immature, 3'6 form of the TcR raises the question as to whether some T cell precursors may enter the epithelium and undergo aberrant education in this site. It is, therefore, interesting that many of the \"activation\" markers found on IEL, including CTI, UCHLI and CD7 are also found on thymocytes. As many of these concepts may soon prove amenable to the rapidly developing methods of molecular biology and cellular immunology, the biological role of IEL may prove to be less enigmatic within the near future.
