To uncover cellular protein responses in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and Marc-145 cells were subjected to proteomic analysis involving two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS identification. Altered expression of 44 protein spots in infected cells was identified in 2D gels, of which the 29 characterised by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS included 17 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated proteins. Some of these proteins were further confirmed at the mRNA level using real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, Western blot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of HSP27, vimentin and the down-regulation of galectin-1. Our study is the first attempt to analyze the cellular protein profile of PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells using proteomics to provide valuable information about the effects of PRRSV-induced alterations on Marc-145 cell function. Further study of the affected proteins may facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms of PRRSV infection and pathogenesis.",

It is characterised by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in growing pigs and piglets (Wensvoort et al., 1992) . Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the causative agent of PRRS, is a member of the Arteriviridae family. This family is composed of a group of positive (+) sense, single-stranded RNA viruses including simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). PRRSV has a highly restricted cell tropism, both in vivo and in vitro (Kim et al., 1993) . The virus infects the African green monkey kidney cell line MA-104 and its derivatives, Marc-145 and CL-2621, in vitro. PRRSV preferentially infects cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, especially porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), in the natural host (Duan et al., 1997) . In both PAMs and monkey kidney-derived cell lines, the virus enters through a mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Nauwynck et al., 1999) .",

To date, proteomic approaches, e.g., coupling two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) (Blackstock and Weir, 1999) , have been widely used to study mechanisms of viral infection through the comparative analysis of cellular protein profiles (Alfonso et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2008; Ringrose et al., 2008) . This procedure of comparing protein expression patterns of normal and infected cells can provide exclusive information about the response of host cells to viral infection. Proteomic changes in infected host cells have been studied for many pathogenic mammalian viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, rabies virus, Nipah virus and African swine fever virus. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the changes in cellular proteins of Marc-145 cells and PAMs exposed to PRRSV. Furthermore, we also discuss the altered functions of Marc-145 cells and PAMs, induced by PRRSV infection.",

Infection by different viruses causes alterations in the transcription and translation patterns of the host. Increasing evidence emphasises the use of comparative proteomics to screen the differentially expressed proteins associated with pathophysiological host cellular responses to viral infection. Understanding the changes in the cellular proteins of these cells after exposure to PRRSV could reveal molecular mechanisms associated with altered functions of PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells and PAMs. In this study, proteomic methods coupled with real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were applied to identify differentially expressed proteins in PRRSV-infected and mock-infected PAMs and Marc-145 cells.

Although these proteins may not be specific to PRRSV, most cytoskeleton changes detected in PRRSV-infected cells were caused by PRRSV infection. Vimentin is an important cellular cytoskeleton component. Studies have reported a reorganisation of vimentin in certain viral infections, which probably leads to unstable cytoskeletal structure (Stefanovic et al., 2005) . Differential proteomes of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs), with and without IBDV infection, also showed considerable up-or down-regulation of many cytoskeletal proteins; the intermediate filament (IF) vimentin levels also significantly decreased (Zheng et al., 2008) . Furthermore, Fatemel group reported that vimentin was up-regulated in CVS-infected BHK-21 cells (Zandi et al., 2009 ). In the present study, a decrease in the abundance of the actin-binding protein, plectin-1, in the PRRSV-infected group suggests that PRRSV may also manipulate the host cytoskeletal network for its own infectious processes and replication.",

In this study, ubiquitin was identified as a differentially expressed cellular protein during PRRSV infection in Marc-145 cell. The best known function of ubiquitin in proteolysis is to serve as a signal for the target protein to be recognised and degraded by the proteasome. Although the host has a variety of defences to protect against viral infections, sometimes the immune response to the infection is the direct cause of tissue injury.

HSPB1 is an important, small heat shock protein (HSP) that is synthesised in response to a wide variety of stressful stimuli, including viral infection. The abundance of HSPB1 increased in cells infected in vitro with H9N2 avian influenza virus (Liu et al., 2008) , African swine fever virus (Alfonso et al., 2004) , and infectious bursal disease virus (Zheng et al., 2008) . In contrast, decreased levels of HSPB1 were observed in cells infected in vitro with mumps virus (Yokota et al., 2003) and porcine circovirus type 2 (Zhang et al., 2009a,b) , which suggest that HSPB1 may play different roles in different viral infections or different stages of infection. Two antioxidative stress proteins, peroxiredoxin-6 (Prx6) and peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2), were up-regulated, suggesting that PRRSV infection may induce host cell oxidative stress. The cytosolic Prx2 has two highly conserved cysteine residues that become oxidised by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and hydroperoxides, resulting in the reversible formation of a homodimer (Wood et al., 2003) . Human erythrocyte Prx2 reacts extremely rapidly with H 2 O 2 , with a rate constant similar to those observed for catalases and glutathione peroxidases. Prx6 is a bifunctional 25 kDa protein with both GSH (glutathione) peroxidase and phospholipase A2 activities. Overexpression of Prx6 in cells can protect against oxidative stress, whereas antisense treatment results in oxidative stress and apoptosis (Manevich and Fisher, 2005) . We report an increase in the abundance of HSP27 and Prx6 after PRRSV infection in Marc-145 cells and PAMs as measured by 2-DE and real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, the change in HSP27 expression was confirmed by Western blotting. This alteration may allow infected cells to be eliminated by apoptosis, or serve as a form of host defence against PRRSV infection.",

Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is localised in both the cytoplasm and intermembrane space of mitochondria. Because of its ability to scavenge superoxide, SOD1 is considered an essential defence against the downstream generation of ROS other than O 2 \u2212 , which is even more toxic than superoxide itself. In this function, SOD1 is more efficient than SOD2. Although up-regulated during PRRSV infection in PAMs (Zhang et al., 2009a,b) , SOD1 was notably downregulated during PRRSV infection; further investigation will be required to understand its role. Notably, our finding was consistent with a previous report which indicated that PRRSV infection decreased the production of superoxide anion in PAMs. The abundance of several proteins involved in immune response, antigen processing and presentation were also altered in this study. Western analysis showed that galectin-1 was down-regulated in PRRSV-infected PAMs and Marc-145 cells as compared with uninfected cells galectins, a lectin family, have been implicated in various immune response processes through binding to host surface glycoproteins. Studies suggest that galectins participate in the immune response, both as immunomodulators and molecules that facilitate pathogen-host cell interactions (Kohatsu et al., 2006) . In addition, recent evidence indicates that galectins could facilitate pathogen internalization in phagocytic cells, such as macrophages (Van den Berg et al., 2004) . Galectin-1 expression has been reported in thymus and lymphoid parenchymal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, trophoblasts, activated T cells, macrophages, activated B cells, follicular dendritic cells and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Barrionuevo et al., 2007) . Galectin-1 can increase adsorption of X4-utilizing isolates of HIV-1 onto CD4+ T lymphocytes, thus enhancing the overall infection process (Mercier et al., 2008) . Of these, the decrease in galectin-1 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. These data suggest that the proteins identified in this study may play special roles during PRRSV infection or replication.",

Importantly, the comparative proteomic approach identified 29 altered cellular proteins during PRRSV infection. Interestingly, some of the identified proteins have the ability to regulate apoptosis. Our study facilitates a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of PRRSV infection. Further large-scale studies are necessary to understand the roles of the interesting proteins implicated in PRRSV infection.",
