These two diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years of age. Vitamin D is believed to have immunomodulatory effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems by modulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides, like cathelicidin, in response to both viral and bacterial stimuli. The aim of this review is to summarize the more recently published data with regard to potential associations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] with infectious respiratory tract diseases of childhood and the possible health benefits from vitamin D supplementation. Methods The literature search was conducted by using the PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, with the following keywords: vitamin D, respiratory tract infection, tuberculosis, influenza, infancy, and childhood. Results Several studies have identified links between inadequate 25(OH)D concentrations and the development of upper or lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. Some of them also suggest that intervention with vitamin D supplements could decrease both child morbidity and mortality from such causes. Conclusions Most studies agree in that decreased vitamin D concentrations are prevalent among most infants and children with RTIs. Also, normal to high-serum 25(OH)D appears to have some beneficial influence on the incidence and severity of some, but not all, types of these infections. However, studies with vitamin D supplementation revealed conflicting results as to whether supplementation may be of benefit, and at what doses.",

Regulation of transcriptional activity is cell-specific, such as 1,25(OH) 2 D, which inhibits PTH secretion but promotes innate immunity and insulin secretion and inhibits adaptive immunity [7, 8] . Due to the wide distribution of the VDR in cells and tissues, the biologic action of vitamin D extends to many systems, including the adaptive and the innate immune systems [9] [10] [11] . Since the VDR is expressed in various immune cells, including B, T, and antigen-presenting cells, they are believed to have roles in the improvement of immune function and reduction of inflammation [12] . The discovery, moreover, that vitamin D induces antimicrobial peptide gene expression explains, in part, the \"antibiotic\" effect of vitamin D and has greatly renewed interest in the ability of this vitamin to improve immune function. Current research indicates that this regulation is biologically important for the response of the innate immune system to infection and that deficiency may lead to suboptimal responses to bacterial and viral infections [13] .",

Deficiency or insufficiency may be associated with increased autoimmunity and infections [1] . Historically, a link between vitamin D and innate immune function was identified through the use of cod liver oil as treatment in children with tuberculosis [21] . Nowadays, it is reported that vitamin D regulates innate immunity by increasing the production of antimicrobial peptides and subsequently killing bacteria [13] . The innate immune system is the immediate, nonspecific first line of defense against pathogens, including antimicrobial peptides, and is responsive to circulating levels of 25(OH)D. The active metabolite of vitamin D is a potent stimulator for the genetic expression and production of the effectors of innate immunity antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in human monocytes, neutrophils, and other human cell lines. For this to happen, sufficient circulating levels of 25(OH)D are necessary [22] . As effectors of innate immunity, AMPs directly kill a broad spectrum of microbes, including gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria, fungi, and certain viruses. AMPs are an extremely diverse group of small proteins that are considered together because of their native antimicrobial activity. Two major families of AMPs have been characterized in mammals: cathelicidins and defensins [23] .",

Additionally, they found that supplementary vitamin D treatment in the deficiency cases could decrease the rate of recurrent OM during the 1-year follow-up period. They concluded that coadministration of supplementary vitamin D together with conventional treatments is appropriate in the management of URTIs such as otitis media. The study by Marchisio et al. involved children with a history of recurrent AOM. Half the children randomly received orally 1000 IU daily of vitamin D, and half received placebo over a period of 4 months. Children who received vitamin D supplement raised their serum 25(OH)D levels \u2265 30 ng/mL and significantly reduced their number of uncomplicated AOM compared to those on placebo, who also had significantly lower levels of serum 25(OH)D at the end of the study period.

Several factors, such as seasonal and racial differences, different cut-off values, and differences in the ages of populations studied, might explain the reason for some variations in the results of the studies reviewed.

In addition, from the available evidence, normal to high serum 25(OH)D status appears to have some beneficial influence on the incidence and severity of some, though not all, types of these infections and could therefore be an effective and inexpensive mode of prophylaxis against these infections.",

Conflicting results were found as regards influenza, while there have been no studies at all on pharyngotonsillitis and rhinosinusitis.
