Moreover, coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus can lead to severe respiratory failure. The need for hospitalization due to hMPV infection may be decreased by vaccination with a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. 17 Outbreaks of hMPV infection have been reported among older adults living in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes. 17e24 However, data on such outbreaks is limited because until the last decade the diagnosis was challenging, needing expensive assays.

For each resident, we calculated the modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics scores, developed and published by Linn et al in 1968 for the compilation and quantification of health problems in older adults. In addition, we recorded the number of drugs and the number of antibiotics for respiratory infections prescribed during the symptomatic phase. According to the French immunization schedule, an annual influenza vaccination is required for health care workers and NH residents; it is also recommended for regular visitors. Pneumococcal vaccination for at-risk NH residents is proposed at admission. In our health care setting, both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were made by the same nurse after a physician had checked the absence of medical contraindications.",

It seems difficult to pinpoint a standard infected population profile, although limited autonomy and low ADL score may play a role, particularly because an association has been shown between low ADL and nosocomial infections. 37 The pattern of the spread of infection within the NH may be an explanation for the high infection rate, although the floor on which successive cases occurred was not associated.",

Nevertheless, in 2012 the French Public Health authority recommended the microbiological testing of an ARI if it was severe, had an unfavorable course, and/or concerned an outbreak in a nursing home. In the latter case, it is recommended to make 3 swabs. This recommendation was adhered to in the outbreak reported here.

To our knowledge, the outbreak reported here is 1 of the largest occurring in an NH, allowing us to attempt a more precise description of this infection in the institutionalized older adults with predominantly upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The major limitation was that because of public health policy, swabs for viral identification were not taken in every symptomatic case. Precautions to prevent transmission seem difficult to apply to this population and need to be improved. As a low ADL score has been shown to be associated with risk of infection, the care of older adults with infections should be approached through the prism of capacity trajectory. Interestingly, influenza vaccination appeared to be statistically associated with a higher risk of hMPV infectiondan observation that requires further investigation.",
