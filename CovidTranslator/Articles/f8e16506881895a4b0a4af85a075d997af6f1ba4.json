We also report on the indication of possible antigenic differences between CVLPs from different a r e a s . Sera were obtained from male and female Aborigines living within a 300 km radius of Alice Springs, Central Australia, who had been admitted to Alice Springs Hospital in lVlay--June, 1984 for a variety of reasons. Patients 1, 2, 5 and 11 (Table 1 ) had been admitted for diarrhoea. Faecal specimens from six of these patients (see Table 1 ) had been examined up to 12 months prior to the serum being taken and all of these had been found to be excreting CVLPs. Sera were also obtained from age-and sexmatched Europeans admitted to Alice Springs Hospital during the same period, also for a variety of reasons but none for diarrhoea. Sera from Melbourne European infants and children were obtained from patients admitted to the l~oyal Children's Hospital, Melbourne for a variety of illnesses, including one case of diarrhoea, while sera from Melbourne adults were randomly collected. All were a g e -a n d sex-matched to the Central Australian sera. All sera were inactivated at 56 \u00b0 C for 30 minutes before u s e .",
