The biopolymer was obtained by crosslinking of chitosan (CHIT) with genipin, a nontoxic compound of plant origin, in inverted emulsion and reacting the chitosan nano/microspheres obtained (CHIT-NS/ MS) with glycidyltrimethyl-ammonium chloride (GTMAC). As a result the nano/microspheres of N-(2hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethyl chitosan (HTCC-NS/MS) were obtained. HTCC-NS/MS were studied as the adsorbents of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 particles in aqueous virus suspensions. By studying cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by these viruses and performing PCR analyses it was found HTCC-NS/MS strongly adsorb the particles of HCoV-NL63 virus, moderately adsorb mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) particles, but do not adsorb HCoV-OC43 coronavirus. The adsorption capacity of HTCC-NS/MS well correlated with the antiviral activity of soluble HTCC against a given virus. Importantly, it was shown that HCoV-NL63 particles could be desorbed from the HTCC-NS/MS surface with a salt solution of high ionic strength with retention of virus virulence. The obtained material may be applied for the removal of coronaviruses, purification and concentration of virus samples obtained from biological matrices and for purification of water from pathogenic coronaviruses.",

            "text": "An alternative method of virus purification/removal is virus adsorption which takes advantage of the attractive interaction between a virion and an adsorbent. Such interaction may be of various nature. Since the surface of viruses may become charged depending on their isoelectric point (IEP) and pH of the environment, their interactions with the adsorbents may be primarily electrostatic (at pH values sufficiently different from IEP) or mostly hydrophobic (at pH \u2248 IEP) [15] . The surface of virions may be both positively (at pH b IEP) and negatively (at pH N IEP) charged so they may be adsorbed by sorbents with both negatively and positively charged surface, respectively. Consequently, materials previously reported as virus adsorbents are of different nature. The examples of inorganic adsorbents are clays such as kaolinite, montmorillonite, and bentonite [16] . Their adsorption efficiency for viruses is very different but generally low. For kaolinite at the concentration of 50 g/l the log removal value (LRV) was 2.18, while montmorillonite and bentonite were much less efficient. Thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption of some bacteriophages to clays depended on the hydrophobicity of the surface of both clays and viruses [17] . The ability to adsorb viruses was shown for hybrid organicinorganic materials, e.g., cellulose nanofibers enriched with \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles [18] . The hybrid inorganic nanoparticles with virus particles covalently bound to their surface have been also reported and used as virus delivery systems [19] .",

For this purpose chitosan nano/microspheres (CHIT-NS/MS) crosslinked with genipin, a natural compound obtained from the fruit of Gardenia jasminoides, were prepared and then cationized with GTMAC to obtain nano/microspheres of HTCC (HTCC-NS/MS). Chemical composition of obtained biomaterials was investigated using elemental analysis (EA) and spectroscopic methods. The morphology and size of the polymeric objects obtained was visualized using microscopic techniques, i.e., confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The hydrodynamic radius of the nanospheres was determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. Surface charge in different media was assessed using zeta potential measurements. The ability of the biomaterial to adsorb selected coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, MHV and HCoV-OC43) was assessed. Changes in the infectivity of viral samples, due to interaction with adsorbent, were evaluated by virus titration according to Reed and Muench method and compared with total amount of viral RNA copies using real time PCR analysis. Adsorption and desorption of coronaviral particles on/from the surface of HTCC-NS/MS was directly visualized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique. Careful optimization of the material allowed for recovery (desorption) of infective coronaviral particles, which further broadens its possible applications. An advantage of the studied material is that chitosan (used in many other virus-related applications involving antiviral materials [34] and antiviral drugs [35, 36] ) and genipin, are both non-toxic substances.",

By changing the substitution reaction time the cationically modified particles were obtained with three different degrees of substitution (DS) with GTMAC (corresponding to different cationic charge density), and marked as L-HTCC-NS/MS, M-HTCC-NS/MS, and H-HTCC-NS/MS for particles with low, medium and high DS, respectively. It was confirmed that the cationic functionalization of the CHIT-NS/MS particles did not significantly change their size, as found from confocal microscopy and DLS measurements (see Table A2 in Supplementary Information). To obtain a nanometer-sized fraction the synthesized particles were filtered using a syringe filter with a pore diameter of 0.22 \u03bcm. This allowed isolation of a particle fraction with an average diameter of 60 nm, as found from the DLS measurements. The respective nanoparticles were marked as CHIT-NS, L-HTCC-NS, M-HTCC-NS, and H-HTCC-NS.

The presence of 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/500 \u03bcl H-HTCC-NS/MS in the viral samples resulted in a~187-,~415-, and~700-fold decrease in TCID 50 , respectively, corresponding to N99.4, 99.7, and 99.8% reduction in the virus titer, respectively.",

To find out if the virus inhibitory activity of HTCC is correlated with its adsorptive properties, we studied the specificity of the adsorption of these coronavirus strains by H-HTCC-NS/MS. For this purpose, monolayers of LR7 and HCT-8 cells were infected with MHV and HCoV-OC43, respectively. The infections were carried out for 2 (MHV) and 6 (HCoV-OC43) days at 37\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C, respectively. The virus titrations have shown that MHV titer decreases from TCID 50 of~6,285,500 to~250,200 (about 25 times) due to adsorption on 5 mg/500 \u03bcl H-HTCC-NS/MS while it did not significantly change for HCoV-OC43 (Fig. 7) . Therefore, this polymeric material can be used also for the effective adsorption of MHV, another coronavirus inhibited by water soluble HTCC. It was thus found that the coronaviral strains inhibited by water-soluble HTCC are also adsorbed by the particles made of this polymer which confirms that the anticoronaviral activity of HTCC is due to its direct attractive interaction with the respective viruses.

It was found that HCoV-NL63 and MHV can be adsorbed on the surface of HTCC-NS/MS, while no significant adsorption was observed in the case of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Importantly, HCoV-NL63 is selectively adsorbed in the presence of lysed cell components which indicates that HTCC-NS/MS may be used for virus purification. The correlation of the adsorptive properties of HTCC particles with the virus inhibitory activity of its water-soluble form suggests that the nature of the inhibition is similar to that observed for neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, desorption of the HCoV-NL63 virions adsorbed on the HTCC-NS/MS surface is also possible by applying medium with high ionic strength. Noteworthy, desorbed HCoV-NL63 retained infectiousness. The increased degree of cationization of the polymeric particles enhanced adsorption of HCoV-NL63. This fact together with ionic strength-induced virus desorption indicate that the virus-polymer interaction is due to the electrostatic Coulomb attraction. Strong and selective adsorption of HCoV-NL63 combined with the possibility of the virus desorption with retained virulence indicate that HTCC-NS/MS is a material with a great potential in the detection, removal, separation, concentration and/or purification of HCoV-NL63 coronavirus.
