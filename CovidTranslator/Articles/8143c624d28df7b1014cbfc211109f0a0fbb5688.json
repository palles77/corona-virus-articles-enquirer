            "text": "We assessed the prevalence and performed molecular analysis of Cryptosporidium spp. in diarrheal feces of calves in Korea. Diarrheal fecal samples were collected from 951 young calves (<3 months) on 425 farms. Cryptosporidium prevalence was assessed by PCR and ELISA, and molecular characterization was performed by targeting the 18S rRNA, heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70), and glycoprotein 60 (gp60) genes. Data were analyzed according to the sex, type of cattle, region, season, and type of diarrhea. PCR analysis revealed Cryptosporidium spp. in 9.9% (94/951) of diarrheal fecal samples. C. parvum and C. bovis/ryanae were present in 6.1% (58/951) and 4.1% (39/951) of diarrheal fecal samples, respectively. In addition, ELISA showed positive results for C. parvum in 9.7% (92/951) samples. Statistical analysis of the PCR and ELISA results revealed a lower prevalence of C. parvum in the hemorrhagic diarrheal samples (P < 0.05). For C. bovis/ryanae, seasonality and high prevalence in hemorrhagic diarrhea were observed (P < 0.05). Of the 951 samples tested for C. parvum, 903 samples showed agreement with a value of 0.65, indicating good agreement between the two tests. Although C. bovis and C. ryanae share highly similar 18S rRNA sequences, PCR based on hsp70 successfully distinguished C. bovis from C. ryanae. Sequence analysis of gp60 revealed that C. parvum belonged to the IIa families and was further subtyped as IIaA18G3R1 and IIaA16G3R1, which have not been previously reported in Asia. These findings indicate that Cryptosporidium spp. play an important role in diarrhea in young calves in Korea. Considering the zoonotic significance of C. parvum IIa subtype and dense rearing system of cattle in Korea, prevention and continuous monitoring of Cryptosporidium are required.",

In addition, all C. bovis/ryanae PCR-positive samples yielded negative ELISA results. Our results indicated that the two tests could be applied compatibly to detect C. parvum in feces. While there was good agreement between the two tests, there were still 41 ELISA+/PCR-samples. This discrepancy may be attributed to two factors: first, the presence of PCR inhibitors such as bilirubin, bile salts, and complex polysaccharides, which are included in feces, and second, limitations in the sensitivity and specificity in each assay (Morgan et al., 1998) . Thus, additional studies are required to clarify the discrepancy in detecting Cryptosporidium spp. using the two assays.",

In the present study, 18S rRNA was successfully used to identify Cryptosporidium spp.; however, because sequence identity is greater than 99% 18S rRNA among some Cryptosporidium spp. (C. bovis, C. ryanae, and C. xiaoi), it is not always possible to differentiate the species by PCR (Sant\u00edn and Zarlenga, 2009; Mirhashemi et al., 2016) . The sequences obtained in the present study also showed 99% 18S rRNA sequence identity for C. bovis and C. ryanae; however, phylogenetic analysis was used to differentiate these two species. In addition, we amplified hsp70 in C. bovis, and this sequence clearly differed from those in C. ryanae (EU410346) and C. xiaoi (FJ896041), with 88.9% and 97.5% identity, respectively. Because there is only one C. bovis hsp70 sequence (AY741306) in the GenBank database and the sequence contains only 384 bp, our sequence information will be useful for further investigations. We recommend targeting hsp70, rather than 18S rRNA, to identify C. bovis, C. ryanae, and C. xiaoi.",

The C. parvum and C. hominis subtype families can be distinguished based on variations in gp60 sequences and according to repetition of the trinucleotide region (Sulaiman et al., 2005) .

Of the C. parvum subtype families (from IIa to IIo), the IIa and IId families are the most dominant families responsible for zoonotic cryptosporidiosis (Ryan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) . IId families are considered to be dominant in Asian and African animals, while IIa families are dominant in American, European, and Oceanian animals (Wang et al., 2014) .",

This makes the farm environment more vulnerable to Cryptosporidium spp., which are transmitted via the fecal-oral route with direct contact (Zhang et al., 2015) . Because a very small number of oocysts can initiate C. parvum infection (Okhuysen et al., 1999) , and there are a limited number of medicines available to treat cryptosporidiosis (Ryan et al., 2014) , prevention is the most important method for reducing economic losses in the livestock industry. This is the first nationwide epidemiological study on the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in the diarrheal feces of calves in Korea. Our study showed that Cryptosporidium spp. play an important role in diarrhea in young calves and that C. parvum is the dominant Cryptosporidium species. In addition, gp60 analysis revealed that C. parvum in Korea belonged to the IIaA18G3R1 and IIaA16G3R1 families, which have not been previously reported in Asia. Considering the zoonotic significance of C. parvum IIa subtype and the dense rearing system in Korea, prevention and continuous monitoring of Cryptosporidium are required.",
