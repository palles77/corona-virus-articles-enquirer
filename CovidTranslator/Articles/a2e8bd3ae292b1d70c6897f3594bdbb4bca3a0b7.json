We have identiWed the location of the two interacting HR regions that form the six-helix bundle (B. Tripet, et al, J. Biol. Chem., 279: 20836-20849, 2004). In this study, HRC peptide (1150-1185) was chosen as the region to make structure-based substitutions to design a series of HRC analogs with increased hydrophobicity, helical propensity and electrostatic interactions, or with a covalent constraint (lactam bridge) to stabilize the -helical conformation. EVects of the substitutions on -helical structure of HRC peptides and their abilities to interact with HRN or HRC have been examined by biophysical techniques. Our results show that the binding of the HRC analogs to HRN does not correlate with the coiled-coil stability of the HRC analogs, but their interactions with HRC does correlate with their stability, except for HRC7. This study also suggested three types of potential peptide inhibitors against viral entry can be designed, those that simultaneously inhibit interaction with HRC and HRN and those that are either HRC-speciWc or HRN-speciWc. For example, our study shows the important role of -helical structure in the formation of the six-helix bundle where the lactam bridge constrained analog (HRC5) provided the best interaction with HRN. The importance of -helical structure in the interaction with native HRC was demonstrated with analog HRC4 which binds best to HRC.",

The virus has not re-emerged since July 2003, except for several cases of laboratory-acquired infections and one natural outbreak resulting in four infected people (Normile, 2004a; Normile, 2004b) . However, since SARS-CoV-related viruses have been detected in some animals, it still remains a threat due to its highly transmittable nature to human populations and the mysterious origin of SARS-CoV (Guan et al., 2003; Hartley and Smith, 2003) . Currently, since there is no eVective agent for the anti-viral therapy of SARS-CoV infection, it is imperative to learn as much as possible about this virus to accelerate the development of therapeutics and vaccines for its re-emergence.",

            "text": "Infection by SARS coronavirus requires fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, which is mediated by the viral envelope Spike (S) glycoprotein and receptors on the target cell (Holmes, 2005) . The S protein is a type I viral fusion protein which contains two highly conserved heptad repeat (HR) domains that have been shown to form coiledcoil structures (Bosch et al., 2003; Hakansson-McReynolds et al., 2006; Spaan et al., 1988; Tripet et al., 2004) . The HR region located closest to the N-terminus in the sequence is denoted HRN and the HR region located closest to the Cterminus is denoted HRC. Although the exact mechanism by which the SARS-CoV enters the host cell has not been elucidated, it is most likely similar to other coronaviruses. Upon binding to the receptor at the cell membrane, the fusion protein will be induced into the fusogenic intermediate state with a dramatic conformation change. Collapse of this fusogenic intermediate leads to a six-helix bundle (trimer of dimers) formation between HRN and HRC, which ultimately promotes membrane fusion (Eckert and Kim, 2001b) . Our laboratory and other researchers recently reported (Bosch et al., 2004; Ingallinella et al., 2004; Tripet et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004b) that HR regions of SARS-CoV S protein can associate to form a very stable -helical six-stranded structure and the orientation of the HR regions is anti-parallel. Residues 902-950 in the HRN region and 1151-1185 in the HRC region were identiWed to be crucial for their interaction. The structure of the ectodomain of SARS Spike protein in its fusogenic/post-fusogenic state and HR interaction regions have recently been con-Wrmed by crystallography (Duquerroy et al., 2005; Supekar et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004a) . Most recently, Li et al. (2005) reported the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S receptor binding domain (residues 306-575) complexed with receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which further conWrms the prediction that SARS-CoV fusion process is similar to other viruses with type I fusion proteins. Hakansson-McReynolds et al. (2006) also reported the solution structure of the SARS-Coronavirus HRC domain in the prefusion state, which forms a coiled-coil symmetric trimer.",

            "text": "A critical step in viral entry is the conformational change of the fusion domain of the S protein. Peptides derived from the HRC region of the HIV-1 gp41 and other class I fusion proteins have been reported to show signiWcant viral fusion inhibitory activity Eckert and Kim, 2001a; Root et al., 2001) . It has been proposed that HRC analogs bind strongly to the transiently exposed HRN coiled-coil trimer, and block the formation of the sixhelical bundle necessary for the fusion. For HIV and murine CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), HRC peptides have been shown to inhibit viral entry at nanomolar concentrations (Bosch et al., 2004; . Recently, a HIV peptide inhibitor has been made by the fusion of gp41 HRN region and a trimeric forming coiledcoil peptide, where the three chains are covalently linked by disulWde bridges. This construct was a potent inhibitor of viral entry at pM concentration (Bianchi et al., 2005) . One of the HRC peptides of HIV-1 gp41, Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon), was approved by the FDA for treatment of AIDS (LaBonte et al., 2003) . In several recent studies (Bosch et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004) , SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion was shown to be inhibited by HRC-derived peptides; however, these peptides inhibited viral entry at concentrations in the micromolar range (Bosch et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004) . One possible reason for the higher inhibitory concentration is that the interaction between the inhibitory peptides and HRN or HRC is too weak to prevent the native intra-molecular association of HRN and HRC. As reported in studies of HIV peptide inhibitors, considerable genetic and biophysical evidence supports the concept that the ability of the Class I envelope glycoprotein to mediate membrane fusion is determined, in part, by the high stability of the six-helix bundle (Eckert and Kim, 2001b; Skehel and Wiley, 2000) . Thus, peptides inhibiting the fusion process must be designed with the highest binding aYnity/stability to be useful for preventing viral entry.",

Second, substitutions in the peptide sequence to change its conformation or stability could substantially aVect the interaction with the target (HRN or HRC) Eckert and Kim, 2001a; Lu et al., 1995) . For example, the HRC region was shown to have -helical structure on its own (Hakansson-McReynolds et al., 2006; Tripet et al., 2004) , suggesting that enhancement of -helical structure and stability could increase aYnity of potential peptide inhibitors for their helical targets. Factors that contribute to the helical conformation of peptides and stability of coiled-coils have been systematically studied (Chakrabartty et al., 1994; Houston et al., 1995; Houston et al., 1996; O'Neil and DeGrado, 1990; Tripet et al., 2000; Wagschal et al., 1999b; Zhou et al., 1994) . There are two general ways to stabilize the coiled-coil. Increasing the hydrophobicity of the residues in the hydrophobic core stabilizes the coiled-coil (Tripet et al., 2000; Wagschal et al., 1999b) or increasing interactions that stabilize the individual -helix (increasing -helical propensity of residues, adding intra-chain electrostatics or intrachain covalent constraints) which in turn stabilizes the coiled-coil by shifting the monomer-trimer equilibrium in favor of the folded trimeric coiled-coil.

Region 1 involves residues 1150-1160 of HRC which are helical in the prefusion state (NMR solution structure of the HRC trimer) and extended in the 6-helix bundle conformation. That is, in this region hydrophobes Ile 1151a, Ile 1154d, and Val 1158a are in the hydrophobic core in the pre-fusion state and hydrophobe Val 1159b is exposed on the outside of the trimeric coiled-coil of HRC. In contrast, in the six-helix bundle conformation Val 1159b is now buried along with Ile 1151a and Ile 1154d on interaction with HRN and Val 1158a is now exposed. That is, there has been a switch of hydrophobes between the two states involving Val 1158a and Val 1159b. Region 2 involves residues 1161-1175 which are helical in both the prefusion state (HRC trimeric state) and the six-helix bundle conformation and the same four hydrophobes (Ile 1161d, Ile 1165a, Leu 1168d, and Leu 1175d) are stabilizing this helical structure in both states (interacting with the other chains of the HRC trimer or interacting with the HRN trimer). In this region there is also one hydrophobe not in the a and d positions, Val 1171g, which is interacting to stabilize the hydrophobic core in the HRC trimer and is also involved in the interaction with HRN. This residue is conserved as a hydrophobe in all coronaviruses as Val, Leu or Ala (Duquerroy et al., 2005) . Region 3 involves residues 1176-1185 of HRC which are helical in the HRC trimer and extended in the six-helix bundle conformation. That is, hydrophobes Leu 1179a, Leu 1182d, and Leu 1185g are in the hydrophobic core of the HRC trimer and Ile1180b is exposed on the outside of the trimeric coiled-coil of HRC. In contrast, in the six-helix bundle conformation Ile 1180b is now buried along with Leu 1182d on interaction with HRN, and Leu 1179a is now exposed (Leu 1185g is not present in the crystal structure of the six-helix bundle). That is, there has been a switch of hydrophobes between the two states involving residues Leu 1179a and Ile 1180b. It is interesting that the two hydrophobes, Val 1159b, and Ile 1180b that are surface exposed in the HRC trimer and buried on interaction with HRN in the six-helix bundle conformation are conserved among all coronaviruses as a hydrophobe (Val or Leu at position 1159 and a -branched hydrophobe Val or Ile at position 1180), indicating their importance to presumably stabilize the six-helix bundle conformation (Duquerroy et al., 2005) .",

A HRC inhibitor could inhibit six-helix bundle formation in several ways: by binding to native HRC, by binding to native HRN or by interacting with both regions. The requirement for the complete HRC sequence 1150-1185 for binding to HRN was demonstrated by our deletion analogs (Table 3 ). The importance of the N-terminal region of HRC to interact with HRN was demonstrated by the 25-residue peptide (HRC 25) which had 11 residues (1150-1160) deleted from HRC was unable to interact with HRN. Adding back 3 additional residues (VVN, residues 1158-1160) to HRC 25 produced HRC 28 which bound to HRN with a T m value for the HRC/HRN complex of 58\u00b0C, compared to the stability of HRN-HRC complex of 85\u00b0C (Table 2 ). This result illustrates that the N-terminal seven residues (1150-1157) are extremely important for HRC binding to HRN. In particular, based on the X-ray structure of the six-helix bundle Ile 1151 or Ile 1154 interact with HRN in the hydrophobic core as discussed above. Similarly, truncation of the N-terminal residues 1150-1160 from the HRC5 sequence (Fig. 1) , the best binding analog to HRN (Table 2 ) also showed no interaction with HRN. This result is also supported by Duquerroy et al. (2005) , who reported that the extended regions of HRC consolidate their interaction with HRN by a string of asparagine and glutamine side chains from the HRN coiled-coil, which hydrogen bond to the HRC main chain. This extensive hydrogen-bonding network zips the HRC chain along the HRN interhelical grooves.",

The order of stability of these analogs was HRC2 < HRC1 < HRC3 < HRC4 (Table 1) . Interestingly, this identical order was obtained for the stability of 1:1 mixtures of these analogs with HRC (Table 4 ). These results suggest that increasing the stability of the HRC analogs increases their ability to interact with the native HRC sequence. The most stable analog of this series of analogs was HRC4 with a T m of 74\u00b0C compared to HRC with a T m of 37\u00b0C at a peptide concentration of 70 M (Table 1) . Thus, this dramatic increase in stability does not prevent interaction with HRC and suggests that the stability of this HRC analog is not so high as to prevent interaction with the native HRC sequence whether the interaction is based on the oligomeric coiled-coil or monomer of the analog interacting with the native HRC sequence.",

However, the substitutions of Asp and Glu in HRC to Glu and Lys in HRC6 suggest that Asp and Glu must be important for the stability of the trimeric coiled-coil of HRC since HRC6 was less stable than the native HRC sequence by 5\u00b0C (Table 1 ). This clearly demonstrates that the covalent constraint does stabilize the -helix and the interaction of HRC5 with HRC but that the location of the constraint should be such as to not disrupt the coiled-coil in the control peptide with the non-covalent ion-pair (HRC6). Thus, we probably did not achieve maximum beneWt of this covalent constraint. Since HRC5 stabilized the complex with HRN more than any other analog (Table 4) , HRC5 should be classiWed as a potential HRN-speciWc or combined HRN and HRC inhibitor. Thus, clearly stabilizing the -helical region in the six-helix bundle state is advantageous.",

            "text": "In fact, HRC4 (8 Ala substitutions to increase -helical propensity, Fig. 1 ) formed the most stable oligomeric coiled-coil of all the HRC analogs (T m of 74\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C for native HRC, Table 1 ) and the least stable complex with HRN (T m of 59 or 26\u00b0C below the stability of the native HRN/HRC complex, Table 2 ). On the other hand, HRC4 formed the most stable complex with native HRC increasing the T m by 50\u00b0C (Table 4 ). These results can be explained based on structural information. Stabilizing the helix analog along the length of the trimeric coiled-coil provides an excellent potential inhibitor of the six-helix bundle state by complexing with native HRC (a potential HRC-speciWc inhibitor), but stabilizing region 1 and 3 (Fig. 1) in the helical conformation prevents the conformational change of these regions to go to the extended conformation in the six-helix bundle conformation. Also, we have substituted the two conserved residues Val 1159 and Ile 1180 with Ala and these residues are critical for interaction with HRN. Thus, HRC4 would not exert its inhibitory eVect by binding to HRN. HRC7, with 10 substitutions of Glu and Lys into the HRC sequence at positions b, c, f, and g to create a series of i to i + 3 and i to i + 4 intrachain electrostatic interactions (Fig. 1) , did stabilize the -helical structure of the trimer by 24\u00b0C compared to native HRC (Table 1) . CD results suggested an interaction of HRC7 and HRC (Fig. 10 ) but no interaction was observed by Native-PAGE (Fig. 11) or SPR (Table 4) . Though these salt-bridges stabilize the coiled-coil structure, at least some of these side-chains in this analog must be critical for disrupting interactions with native HRC. Thus, the interaction with HRC requires more than just the packing of the a and d positions of the hydrophobic core which are identical in HRC7 and native HRC. In addition, HRC7 showed absolutely no binding to HRN. This can be explained by the fact that the 3 conserved hydrophobes in all coronaviruses (positions 1159, 1171, and 1178 ) that are important for binding to HRN have been substituted by charged residues which would disrupt and destabilize the interaction with HRN. Recently it was also reported that position 1160 is a conserved Asn/Asp residue in coronaviruses and from the structure of the six-helix bundle the side-chain hydrogen bonds to the polypeptide backbone of HRC and Glu 1164 is conserved for interaction with HRN via a salt bridge (Duquerroy et al., 2005) . Therefore, the substitution of these Wve positions would be expected to abolish binding to HRN.",
