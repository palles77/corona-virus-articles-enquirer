A green and cost-effective method for its preparation is highly desired. Using sitedirected mutagenesis, we previously obtained a variant of \u03b2-glucuronidase from Aspergillus oryzae Li-3 (PGUS1), which can specifically transform glycyrrhizin (GL) into GAMG. In this study, a facile method was established to prepare a CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower for enzyme immobilization, based on protein-inorganic hybrid selfassembly. Under optimal conditions, 1.2 mg of a CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower precipitate with 71.2% immobilization efficiency, 35.60 mg$g -1 loading capacity, and 118% relative activity was obtained. Confocal laser scanning microscope and scanning electron microscope results showed that the enzyme was encapsulated in the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower. Moreover, the thermostability of the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower at 55\u00b0C was improved, and its half-life increased by 1.3 folds. Additionally, the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower was used for the preparation of GAMG through GL hydrolysis, with the conversion rate of 92% in 8 h, and after eight consecutive runs, it had 60% of its original activity.",

            "text": "Licorice, a traditional herbal medicine, is widely utilised in many industries, including the food, pharmacy, and cosmetic industries [1] . Glycyrrhizin (GL), is a typical triterpenoid saponin and the major functional component of licorice, and efficacious against inflammation, allergy, tumor, and asthma [2] . However, the low target organ bioavailability of GL, owed to its high polarity, can reportedly be efficiently solved by hydrolyzing one of its glucuronic acid moieties, thus, yielding the derivative glycyrrhetinic acid 3-O-mono-\u03b2-D-glucuronide (GAMG). Additionally, GAMG is approximately 940 folds sweeter than sucrose, and more than 4 folds sweeter than GL, which prompts its future application as a functional natural sweetener with low-calories [3] . Biocatalysis holds the most promise for performing this transformation because of its rigorous substrate specificity [4] . \u03b2-Glucuronidase, which hydrolyzes the glucuronic bond from its nonreducing end to release glucuronic acid and aglycone moieties, has recently become popular for glucuronide conjugate modification. At present, a few \u03b2-glucuronidases that can specifically transform GL into GAMG have been reported. However, their industrial application has been limited by the difficulty of their large scale preparation and their low activity [5] [6] [7] . Our lab has previously identified 3 fungal \u03b2-glucuronidases from Aspergillus oryzae Li-3 (PGUS), Aspergillus terreus Li-20, and Aspergillus ustus Li-62, which showed high activity and poor substrate specificity in the transformation of GL to glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) [8] . Recently, we uncovered the substrate recognition mechanism of PGUS by solving its crystal structure in the intermediate GAMG complex, and obtained the PGUS variant A365H/R563E (PGUS1) by rational site-directed mutagenesis [9, 10] . PGUS1 had rigorous substrate specificity towards GL, with GAMG as the main product, and can be produced in large-scale by heterologous expression in E. coli. These properties make PGUS1 an ideal biocatalyst for the industrial preparation of GAMG through GL hydrolysis.",

            "text": "Immobilization has become an efficient technology for overcoming the drawbacks of free enzyme in real applications, including instability under harsh conditions and low reusability [11] [12] [13] . High immobilization yields can be obtained in immobilization by physical methods such as absorption and encapsulation, but the immobilization is usually unstable and associated with enzyme leakage during the reaction [14] . Immobilization by chemical methods such as cross-linking and covalent binding can yield a very strongly bounded enzyme with high reusability [15] , but is relatively complicated and the chemical reactions usually cause decreased enzyme activity. A facile preparation of enzyme-inorganic hybrid nanoflower has recently been proposed for enzyme immobilization, due to its many advantages such as high surface to volume ratio, easy preparation, low toxicity to enzymes, and high enzyme activity retention. The nanoflowers have been successfully used to prepare several enzymes such as laccase [16] , carbonic anhydrase [16] , lipase [17] , a-amylase [18] , and horseradish peroxidase [19] , which are all relatively small proteins with molecular weights < 70 kDa. However, the applicability of this method to larger multimonomeric proteins with larger molecular weights needs further investigation. PGUS1 is an ideal model enzyme since it is a homotetramer with a molecular weight of 290 kDa.",

When the enzyme concentration were > 0.4 mg$mL -1 , precipitate mass, loading capacity, and relative activity fluctuated, indicating enzyme saturation. Hence, the optimal enzyme concentration was 0.4 mg$mL -1 . Reportedly, medium protein concentrations boost nanoflower formation, and higher protein concentrations result in the formation of nanoflowers with buds, due to the presence of excess CaHPO 4 particles during the nucleation period [23] . In this study, the dramatic increase of the mass of the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower at enzyme concentrations of 0.8-1.0 mg$mL -1 may be attributed to the nanoflower buds, which is unfavorable to enzyme immobilization.",

The mass was only 0.8 mg at 4\u00b0C and 0.9 mg at 20\u00b0C. However, enzyme loading capacity and relative activity were lowest at 40\u00b0C (Figs. 3(b,c) ), which may be because the high temperature prompted molecular diffusion and too many CaHPO 4 particles were formed during the initial period of nucleation, which were unfavorable to enzyme activity in CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower formation. In addition, due to thermal inactivation, high temperatures may result to partial enzyme activity loss. Therefore, temperatures < 20\u00b0C favor the formation of CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower. Moreover, the highest relative activity was achieved at 12 and 24 h during incubation at 4\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C, respectively. The 3 widely accepted stages for nanoflower formation include: (1) Proteins form complexes with divalent ions through their amine groups, which provide a nucleation site for the formation of primary inorganic nanoparticles; (2) Proteins form petals by linking inorganic nanoparticles; and (3) Petals are assembled to form nanoflowers [24] . The nanoflower formation time of different hybrid systems is significantly different. For example, it reportedly takes 72 h to form the horseradish peroxidase-Cu 3 (PO 4 ) 2 and bovine serum albumin-Cu 3 (PO 4 ) 2 nanoflowers [25] .",

As shown in Figs. 4(a, b) , the diameter of the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower composed of several nanoplates was approximately 3 \u00b5m, similar to the previously reported diameter of the HRP-embedded hybrid Cu 3 (PO 4 ) 2 $3H 2 O nanoflower [25] . To verify enzyme encapsulation in the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower, FITC-labeled PGUS1 was used to prepare the hybrid nanoflower, and CLSM was used to characterize it (Fig. 4(c) ). We confirmed the absence of fluorescent signals of PGUS1-free precipitates; hence, all signals were owed to PGUS1 precipitates. Fluorescence signals were observed for the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflowers containing FITC-labeled PGUS1, indicating the involvement of the enzyme in precipitate formation. As shown in Table 3 , the zeta potential of CaHPO 4 was -19.1 mV, but increased to -10.8 mV after the introduction of PGUS1. This may be caused by the charge of the enzyme. In addition, conductivity decreased from 4.9-1.0 mS$cm -1 after the introduction of PGUS1, because most of the free ions in the solution were involved in nanoflower formation, thus, decreasing the amount left for conductivity. In the absence of the enzyme, no regular nanoparticles were formed, as the sizes of those formed could not be determined since their values exceeded the measuring range. In the presence of PGUS1, the particle sizes of the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower were approximately 3.6 \u00b5m, consistent with the SEM results. The particle sizes of the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower were between 3-5 \u00b5m, similar to those previously reported [26, 27] . When the particle size is small, the nanoflower structure cannot be formed, and when it is too large, the formed nanoflower structure is unstable. Although CaHPO 4 crystal formation could occur without PGUS1 participation, it cannot be automatically assembled to form CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflowers in the absence of PGUS1 as glue.",

The residual activity after treatment at 55\u00b0C was tested using a GL hydrolysis assay. As shown in Fig. 5(a) , free PGUS1 lost most of its activity, with < 25% of its residual activity left after 10 h. The CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower showed improved thermostability, and maintained approximately 50% of its residual activity after 10 h, indicating it can improve enzyme thermostability. The semi-log plot of residual activity showed a good linear relation with incubation time at 55\u00b0C (Fig. 5(b) ), indicating that the deactivation of both free PGUS1 and CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower followed first-order kinetics. The thermal deactivation rate constant of free PGUS1 (0.16 h -1 ) was 1.3 folds higher than that of CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower (0.07 h -1 ), because the thermostability of CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower (t 1/2 of 10.2 h) was increased by 1.3 folds compared with that of free PGUS1 (t 1/2 of 4.4 h). This may be due to the increased enzyme structure rigidity caused by the interaction between the enzyme and CaHPO 4 . Previous studies have also elucidated the improved thermostability of immobilized enzymes. For example, immobilization reportedly increased the thermal stability of lipase by 2.4 folds [28] .",

The reaction proceeded quickly in the first 4 h, and the GL transformation rate was 1.18 mg(GL) $g -1 (nanoflower)$h -1 . However, for the free enzyme, the conversion was only 82%, even after 16 h.

Moreover, deactivation and leakage of the enzyme were also responsible for the activity loss. Centrifugation during the recycling of the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower after each run caused leakage of the enzyme from the nanoflower. For future studies, a continuous process should be designed to alleviate enzyme leakage. The reusability of the CaHPO 4 -PGUS1 hybrid nanoflower was better than those of previously immobilized \u03b2-glucuroni- dase. For example, Wei et al. fabricated a bifunctional graphene/\u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 hybrid aerogels for \u03b2-glucuronidase immobilization, whose retained activity was decreased to 34.8% after 7 runs [29] . More recently, Kaleem et al. immobilized \u03b2-glucuronidase on ZnO nanoparticels, and the retained activity was less than 40% after 7 runs [30] . Therefore, the potential for the industrial application of the hybrid nanoflowers is high, owing to their stability and reusability.",
