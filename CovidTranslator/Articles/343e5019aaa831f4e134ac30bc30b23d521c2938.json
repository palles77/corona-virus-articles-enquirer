As far as is known, this outbreak was not due to the deliberate release of the SARS-CoV coronavirus, but rather was a naturally occurring event. The appearance of SARS seems to have involved: (1) a zoonotic origin for SARS-CoV [e.g., horseshoe bats and/or Chiroptera as one wildlife reservoir (Janies et al. 2008) ]; (2) transmission to intermediate hosts [e.g., civet cats, racoon dogs (Feng and Gao 2007) ]; (3) human contact with these intermediate hosts in Southern China (Guangdong Province, November 2002) and subsequent cross-species transmission of the coronavirus to humans (Feng and Gao 2007) ; (4) transmission of the virus through both non-hospital personal contact and hospital staff contact (Zhang 2007) ; and (5) global transmission of the virus via travelers from affected regions in Asia to other countries. SARS was eventually controlled through increased hygienic measures (e.g., face mask protection, frequent hand washing, living quarter disinfection), travel restrictions, and quarantine.",

Document clustering combined documents into groups based on their text similarity. Document clustering provided numbers of documents in each cluster, a proxy metric for level of emphasis in each taxonomy category. The approach used in this study was based on a partitional clustering algorithm (Karypis 2004; Zhao and Karypis 2004) contained within a software package named CLUTO. Figure 1 shows the number of SARS SCI articles (retrieved with the above query) as a function of time. Between 2003 and 2008, a total of 2874 papers were retrieved. For the major country producers of SARS research articles, the temporal production is as follows (country/number of SCI articles): This distribution reflects the countries hit hardest by SARS (China, Singapore, Taiwan, and Canada) and the role of the USA in leading the public health response. Furthermore, the temporal pattern observed reflects the emergence of a previously unrecognized disease, the discovery of its causative agent, and the control/elimination of disease. Publication metrics are counts of papers published by different entities, and citation metrics are counts of citations to documents published by different entities. The citations were aggregated in all the retrieved SCI papers, the authors, specific documents, years, journals, and countries cited most frequently were identified, and are presented in order of decreasing frequency.",

Nevertheless, multilateral collaboration was rapidly established, as exemplified by the WHO-organized multicenter collaborative network. As the literature bibliometrics results show, PRC played a major role in all aspects of diagnosing, treating, and researching the disease. In fact, PRC had a higher fraction of most highly cited papers in this study than in any we have seen before.
