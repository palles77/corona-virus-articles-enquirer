These common properties include kinetics, temperature dependence, and the involvement of coated pits and vesicles, Fig. 1 and of endosomes and lysosomes 4. The analysis of the entry mechanism of enveloped viruses has revealed some of the properties of these endocytic compartments. Studies using SFV /n vitro showed that a low pH is required for membrane fusion and the release of the nucleocapsid s. It was initially thought that the release of viral RNA was a result of the exposure of the virus to the acid environment in lysosomes. However, subsequent kinetic, temperatureshift and inhibitor studies demonstrated that the virus releases its genome in an acidic compartment before reaching the lysosome, i.e. in endosomes 4. Further experiments with SFV and other viruses have defined some of the biochemical characteristics of the endosomal compartment, such as pH and cholesterol contenO -6.",

This shows that the fusion event is mediated by the spike proteins. Detailed information on the role of a fusion protein in this process has been obtained with hemagglutinin (HA) of flu since its three-dimensional structure is known ~\u00b0. At pH 5-6, HA undergoes a specific, irreversible conformational change resulting in the exposure of previously hidden protease sites and an increased ability to bind detergent. The latter is thought to be due to the exposure of the previously hidden hydrophobic N-terminal peptide of HA2. From these and other observations it is postulated that the pH-induced changes enable the HA to interact with the target membrane, leading to local perturbations, coalescence and separation 6.",

Studies of the biosynthesis and asymmetric insertion of integral membrane proteins were first carried out with the viral spike proteins, because pure mRNA was available and the topography of these proteins was known. Using mRNA for the spike giycoprotein G of VSV, it was shown that: (1) membrane proteins use the same mechanism of translocation as secretory proteins; and (2) insertion into the membrane and giycosylation are co-translational events, with carbohydrate being added within the lumen of the ER 14.",

The observation that deletion mutants lacking the region encoding the hydrophobic transmembrane domain result in secreted forms of the spike proteins 15,16 implicates this region as a stop transfer sequence. The construction of chimeric molecules in which the transmembrane domain of VSV-G has been fused to a secretory protein t7 or the ectodomain of another membrane protein (Ref. 18 and M. J.

The details of the involvement of the Golgi in the routing of plasma membrane proteins were first shown with the glycoproteins of enveloped viruses 21,22. Bergmann and Singer 21 used a temperature-sensitive mutant of VSV which accumulated G-protein in the ER at the non-permissive temperature.

Using the spike proteins of SFV as markers and monensin (a carboxylic ionophore which blocks transport within the Golgi complex), it has been shown that the Golgi complex is comprised of a series of discrete, biochemically defined compartments (c/s, medial, trans20, through which the viral problems pass sequentially. The transport of one viral protein, VSV-G, between these compartments has been reconstituted in a cell-free system 25. In this in vitro assay, a clone of VSV-infected CHO (Chinese hatlaster ovary) cells deficient in the (medial) Golgi enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyi transferase is used as a source of a 'donor' Golgi membrane fraction containing newly synthesized VSV-G protein lacking terminal N-acetylglucosamine. This fraction is mixed with 'acceptor' Golgi membranes obtained from uninfected wild-type cells containing the transferase. Fusion between the donor and acceptor fractions indicates transport between successive Golgi compartments and is monitored by the incorporation oflabeled N-acetylglucosamine into VSV-G. In this system, transport is dissociative (i.e. carried out by small vesicles) and vectorial, such that there is only a defined period of time in which the donor membranes can transfer VSV-G to the acceptor compartment. This interaction requires ATP, cytosol and exposed proteins on both membrane fractions. These studies provide information about some of the factors and intermediates involved in intra-Golgi transport and illustrate the advantages of an in vitro approach; however, the molecular components responsible for initially directing the viral glycoproteins to the Golgi and controlling the specificity of the various fusion events remain elusive.",

It has been postulated that structural features of the protein are involved in this sorting process. One current idea is that transmembrane proteins destined for the plasma membrane interact with cytoplasmic elements which direct their transport. The role of the cytoplasmic tails of VSV-G, HA and E2 (of SFV) in intracellular transport has been examined by the expression of cDNAs from which variable amounts of the 3' end (carboxyterminal) had been removed. Some of these mutants fail to be transported from the ER, probably because of gross conformational changes induced by the mutations. The results with the forms that are transported to the plasma membrane can be summarized as follows: (1) .alterations in the cytoplasmic domain often decrease the rate of transport between the ER and the Golgi without affecting the rate from the Golgi to the plasma membrane; and (2) there appears to be no dominant or conserved region of the carboxyterminal domain which dictates the efficiency of transport. Mutants having different tail lengths and charge distributions display phenotypes which are indistinguishable from the native molecule7.26. 27. These findings suggest that the cytoplasmic tail alone is not the recognition signal for transport to the plasma membrane.",

Influenza virus is selectively assembled at the apical surface whereas VSV and SFV mature from the basolateral plasma membrane. Thus, viral envelope proteins, like endogenous epithelial cell membrane proteins, are segregated into specific surface domains. Since it has been established that the carbohydrate moieties are not involved in their segregation 28, some other feature located in at least one of the three topological domains of a transmembrane protein must be recognized by the sorting machinery. The polar expression from engineered cDNA of truncated forms of HA and SFV-E2, lacking either the cytoplasmic tail or both the tail and the transmembrane region, suggests that these domains are not needed for directed transport in AGMK (African Green Monkey kidney) and MDCK cells, respectively (M.

Finally, strains which were defective in general protein synthesis were discarded. Only two mutants were identified by this 'brute force' screen. The low overall efficiency stressed the need for an enrichment step, the clue to which was the observation that secl cells failed to increase in volume at the restrictive temperature, but continued to increase in mass 1, a situation similar to that observed upon starvation of an inositol auxotroph z. In the latter case, Henry et aL 2 demonstrated that the starved cells could be resolved from normal cells on a density gradient. A similar gradient resolved secl-1 cells from wild-type cells 3. By incubating mutagen-treated cells at 37\u00b0C for 3 h and using a density gradient to isolate the densest cells, we achieved a 50-fold enrichment for temperaturesensitive secretion mutants 3.",
