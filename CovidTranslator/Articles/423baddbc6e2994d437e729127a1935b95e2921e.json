In our online tool we apply it to acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators. For each resource one must know the average length-of-use per admitted COVID-19 patient (for the cases). It is important to use the average duration of use and not the median. It is also important to separate lengths of use as mutually exclusive and nonmutually exclusive when appropriate. For example, a patient is admitted to hospital, spends the first 5 days in acute care, 6 days in critical care (no intubation), followed by another 6 days in critical care intubated, another 2 days in critical care (no intubation), and 5 more days in acute care.
