Coronaviruses specifically package genomic RNA into assembled virions, and in SARS-CoV, it is reported that this process is driven by an interaction between the Nprotein and a packaging signal encoded within the viral RNA. While recent studies have uncovered the sequence of this packaging signal, little is known about the specific interaction between the N-protein and the packaging signal sequence, and the mechanisms by which this interaction drives viral genome packaging. In this study, we developed a novel in vivo cell-based assay for examining this interaction between the N-protein and packaging signal RNA for SARS-CoV, as well as other viruses within the coronaviridae family. Our results demonstrate that the N-protein specifically recognizes the SARS-CoV packaging signal with greater affinity compared to signals from other coronaviruses or noncoronavirus species. We also use deletion mapping to identify a 151-nt region within the packaging signal sequence that is critical for N-protein-RNA binding, and conversely, we show that both the Nterminal and C-terminal domains of the N protein are necessary for recognizing the packaging RNA. These results describe, for the first time, in vivo evidence for an interaction between the SARS-CoV Nprotein and its packaging signal RNA, and demonstrate the feasibility of using this cell-based assay to further probe viral RNA-protein interactions in future studies.",

SARS-CoV is an enveloped, plus-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that can infect and replicate in a number of human cell types, including pneumocytes and enterocytes in the respiratory system, intestinal mucosal cells, immune cells, and neurons. A defining property of the virus is that it produces a nested set of subgenomic RNAs via discontinuous transcription, which are in turn translated into viral structural proteins as well as additional accessory proteins [3, 4] . The four structural proteins include the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, which are encoded in the 3' end of the viral genome; of these, the N-protein is the most abundant protein in virus-infected cells, and is the only protein found in the nucleocapsid.",

Previous studies have identified the packaging signals of the human coronavirus and the mouse hepatitis virus as a conserved region embedded within the coding sequence for nonstructural protein 15 [5e14] .

The N-protein harbors two distinct RNAbinding domains, a potentially unique characteristic among capsid proteins of other RNA viruses. While the N-terminal domain (NTD) functions as a monomer, the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the Nprotein forms oligomers that may drive helical nucleocapsid formation [15e19].

Thus far, studies that have characterized this interaction have relied on systems using either unnatural synthetic RNA or non-viral RNA substrates in vitro. Nonetheless, investigating the ability of the Nprotein to interact with the packaging signal in living cells is of particular importance, as this would address whether and if so, how the N-protein alone might be able to recognize and interact specifically with the packaging signal amongst a pool of diverse cellular RNAs in vivo. Here, we address this gap in the literature by developing an in vivo cell-based platform to probe the specific interaction between the SARS-CoV N-protein and packaging RNA sequence. We demonstrate that the SARS-CoV N-protein is specific for the SARS-CoV packaging RNA sequence, with lower affinity for packaging sequences of other coronaviruses and even lower for noncoronavirus species. We also show that a 151-nucleotide sequence (positions 168e318) of the SARS-CoV packaging sequence is critical for N-protein binding. Conversely, deletion mapping of the N-protein revealed that both the NTD and the CTD are necessary for binding CoV packaging sequences, and that neither alone were sufficient. These results represent the first time in which the Nprotein-viral RNA interaction was examined in vivo, and provides a framework for further elucidating the exact mechanism by which this interaction occurs in order to coordinate viral packaging.",

Co-expression of the N-protein with a reporter vector encoding the packaging signal of the influenza A/WSN/33 virus (pLacZ-Flu-N(F)-PS57) resulted in 25% inhibition of b-galactosidase activity compared to cells expressing the packaging sequence alone (Fig. 2G) . Similar results were obtained when we visualized blue/ white colonies to screen for interactions between the N-protein and packaging sequences (Fig. 2H) . This demonstrates the specificity of the N-protein for packaging signals of the coronaviridae family, as significant inhibition of b-galactosidase activity is observed only in the presence of both the N-protein with a CoV packaging RNA sequence, and not with the RNA sequence of a non-CoV virus. Conversely, we sought to probe the regions of the N-protein that are responsible for mediating its interactions with the MHV-PS97 and hCoV-PS100 packaging signals. Thus, we performed our cellbased assay using deletion constructs of the N-protein, which harbored various combinations of deletions in the N-terminal domain (NTD), C-terminal domain (CTD), linker region (LKR), or the intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) flanking the N-protein RNA sequence (Fig. 3A) . We confirmed the expression of truncated Nprotein via Western blot, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 .",

Meanwhile, co-expression of the packaging signal with N2(1e181) (Figs. 3C and 4B) or N3(1e365) (Figs. 3D and 4E), which include the N-term IDR and NTD, was able to fully recapitulate the inhibitory effects observed with full length N-protein (Table 1) . A similar result was also obtained via screening for blue/white colonies (Fig. 4H) .

We found that the N-protein is specific for the SARS-CoV packaging sequence and interacts with this sequence at a greater affinity than packaging signals derived from other coronaviruses or viruses of other species, such as the mouse hepatitis virus, the human coronavirus, and the influenza A virus. Furthermore, deletion mapping analysis revealed that a 151-base region in the 318-nt sequence of the SARS-CoV packaging signal is a key mediator of its interaction with the N-protein; however, further experiments are required to explore the exact mechanism by which the N-protein recognizes and binds to this sequence for viral genome packaging.",

These findings support previously published results in which a two-domain fragment containing both the NTD and CTD demonstrated the greatest nucleotide-binding affinity to the oligonucleotides in vitro [15] .

Briefly, transformed bacterial colonies were grown at 37 C in liquid LB broth containing 100 mg/ ml ampicillin and 50 mg/ml of kanamycin until the culture reached an OD600 of 0.4. Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) was added at varying concentrations (0.1 mMe0.5 mM) to induce reporter gene expression, after which absorbance at OD600 was measured at specific time points. 50 mL of cells were then harvested and lysed with 20 mL of 0.1% of SDS, 20 mL of chloroform, and 450 mL of Z-buffer (0.06 M Na 2 HPO 4 , 0.04 M NaHPO 4 , 0.01 M KCL, 1 mM MgSO 4 , and 50 mM b-mercaptiethanol). Subsequently, b-galactosidase activity was determined by adding 100 mL of O-nitrophenyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (ONPG; Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) or 1X chlorophenol red-b-D-galactopyranoside solution (CPRG; Sigma Aldrich Co., MO, USA). After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, the reaction was terminated with 200 mL of 1 M Na 2 CO 3. A portion of the supernatant was taken to measure the absorbance at OD420, OD550, and OD575 with a spectrophotometer (VersaMax Microplate Reader, Molecular devices, CA, USA), and results were analyzed via SoftMax\u00ae Pro Software (Molecular devices, CA, USA). Miller units of b-galactosidase activity were calculated using the following formula: 1000 x (OD420e1.75 x OD550)/(DT x OD600), where DT is the time in-",

Numbers in parenthesis indicate nucleotide lengths of the sequences designated. (B) Effect of N-protein on mouse hepatitis virus PS-lacZ reporter gene expression, and various regions of the PS-RNA sequence (CeG). b-galactosidase activities achieved upon transformation with individual reporter constructs or control vectors, examined in the presence (red; square) and absence (green; triangle) of N-protein, respectively. pLacZ and pTAC are control plasmids that lack expression of either the packaging signal sequence or N-protein, respectively. Results of the ONPG and CPRG assays measuring the interaction of the SARS-CoV N-protein and each packaging signal RNA are shown on the right, as well as a Western blot demonstrating the expression of LacZ (b-galactosidase) at 4 h after IPTG induction. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was probed as a loading control.
