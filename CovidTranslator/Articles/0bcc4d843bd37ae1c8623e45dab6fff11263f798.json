In this paper, K\u20ac ohler and Milstein describe a protocol to immortalize antibody-producing B cells by fusing them to myeloma cells. The resulting fusion product combined the antibody-producing capacity of the original B cell or plasma cell and the immortality of the myeloma cells. Cloned lines of the fusion products were called hybridomas and produced relatively large amounts of antibodies, which were called monoclonal antibodies. The impact of the hybridoma technology cannot be underestimated. Nowadays monoclonal antibodies have found applications in virtually all branches of life sciences. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies was quickly recognized resulting in a large number of lifesaving therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies that are currently produced and marketed by the pharmaceutical industry.",

            "text": "The first generation of antibodies developed for clinical applications were mouse monoclonal antibodies as both the myeloma fusion partners and the B cells were of mouse origin. The first antibody approved for the clinic was OKT3, an antibody against the human CD3e component of the Tcell receptor complex (2) . OKT3 was approved for treatment in transplantation and deleted T cells, thereby reducing the damaging effects of T cell-mediated antigraft reactions. The clinical utility of OKT3 turned out to be limited by its immunogenicity in humans, among other problems, as OKT3 is a mouse antibody. Second-generation therapeutic antibodies were chimeric antibodies in which the constant domains of the mouse immunoglobulin were replaced with those of human. Two examples of such chimeric antibodies are rituximab, an antibody against the B-cell antigen CD20, which is used for therapy in B-cell malignancies and various other diseases, and infliximab, an antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a used in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Advances in antibody engineering resulted in techniques to fully humanize the mouse antibodies by grafting the complementarity determining region (CDR)3 regions into the human immunoglobulin (Ig)G framework. Although humanization of mouse antibodies is still used, animals with human Ig genes are now being used by a growing number of companies to raise therapeutic antibodies. In parallel with the use of mice with human Ig genes and the technical advances with antibody humanization, other technologies have been developed to directly generate fully human antibodies. Phage display is one of those technologies. This method uses a library of bacteriophages that have been engineered to display antibody fragments on their surface. These bacteriophages are screened for binding to target proteins in order to identify the antibody fragments of interest (reviewed in 3). The technology has an advantage over animal-based methods as human B cells can be used to make the Ig libraries representing the naturally occurring repertoire. However, phage display antibodies are frequently unstable because of their artificial pairing of heavy and light chains. Currently, only three antibodies have been approved for clinical use, amongst which the TNF-a-specific antibody adalimumab.",

This includes capturing the complete B-cell repertoire and the generation of stable immortalized B cells. Although fusion of B cells and myeloma cells has been the method of choice to immortalize antibody-producing mouse B cells, there are several drawbacks that limit its applicability to isolate rare B cells. First is that the efficiency of immortalization is rather low. Only a very low proportion of the total mouse B-cell repertoire is captured by the hybridoma technology and clones are often instable. Secondly, whereas the technology works well with mouse and rat B cells, attempts to generate hybridomas with human B cells had limited success. This is caused by the lack of good fusion partners for the human B cells. Recently, the success rate has been improved by the development of better fusion partners and technical advances in using electrofusion (4, 5) .",

Although a number of interesting monoclonal antibodies have been generated (for instance, 10), this technology has its limitations as B cells expand transiently in this protocol. Therefore, this method offers only a limited window of opportunity for finding the desired antigen-specific clone. One possible reason for the limited proliferative capacity of B cells stimulated by CD40L and cytokines is that the activated B cells differentiate to plasma cells in this setting. Plasma cells are terminally differentiated cells and unable to proliferate. The observation by our group that forced expression of BCL-6 (which is known to inhibit terminal differentiation to plasma cells) in activated B cells enables these cells to continue proliferating in response to cytokines and CD40L is consistent with this hypothesis (11, 12) . In this review, we will give an overview of our work on regulation of self-renewal of B cells and how this knowledge led to the development of a convenient antibody discovery platform that is applicable to a wide range of species.",

STAT5 is likely to be involved in the proliferation of human B cells as knockdown of STAT5 using RNA interference strongly decreased proliferation of B cells stimulated with CD40L in the presence of IL-2 and IL-4 (15) . To determine the exact role of STAT5 in B-cell functions, we expressed a fusion of STAT5 with a mutated domain of the estrogen receptor (ER) and STAT3 in activated B cells and examined the response of these cells following incubation with 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4 HT). It was observed that addition of 4 HT strongly enhanced the proliferative response of B cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of a constitutive active form of STAT5 resulted in long-term in vitro proliferation of B cells cultured with CD40L and cytokines, whereas control transduced B cells proliferated only for a limited period of time. These results contradict those of studies in mouse models that have demonstrated that STAT5 is involved in early B-cell development but not in Bcell maturation. Deletion of STAT5 in B cells using CD19 CRE and floxed STAT5 alleles did not result in diminished antibody production (16) . Also, STAT5-deficient mouse B cells proliferate normally in response to IgM stimulation and IL-4 (16) . Perhaps the growth-promoting effect of IL-4 in mice is exclusively mediated by STAT6, whereas in humans STAT5 may be involved in this process as well.",

            "text": "The continued expansion of human B cells by constitutive activation of STAT5 is most likely mediated by control of its target BCL-6 because forced expression of BCL-6 in human B cells also resulted in sustained proliferation of human B cells in response to cytokines and CD40L (15, 17) . The effects of overexpression of active STAT5 in human B cells are however not identical to those of BCL-6. Most notably, continued overexpression and activation of STAT5 eventually result in downregulation of Ig gene expression and other B cell markers, presumably because of epigenetic repression (18) . STAT5-overexpressing cells eventually acquire features of Hodgkin lymphoma cells (19) . BCL-6 is highly expressed in GC B cells and studies in mouse have demonstrated that BCL-6 is essential for the formation of GC (20) . BCL-6 functions to support proliferation and to inhibit differentiation of proliferating B cells to plasma cells in mice (20) and humans (11) . BCL-6 also allows activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)mediated somatic hyper mutations (SHM) and class switch recombinations (CSR) which involves extensive DNA modifications by counteracting a DNA damage response. BCL-6 regulates AID through repression of the microRNA, mir-155 (21) . Plasma cells are characterized by the expression of a different set of transcription factorsthe most important are BLIMP-1 (encoded by PRDM1), which is essential for plasma cell differentiation (22) , and XBP-1, which is needed for the formation of the machinery to secrete large amounts of antibodies (23, 24) . BCL-6 and BLIMP1 crossregulate each other as BCL-6 protein can bind to the PDRM1 locus and repress expression of BLIMP1, thereby inhibiting plasma cell differentiation (11, 25) . The ratio of BCL-6 and BLIMP1 is therefore one of the determining factors whether an activated B cell is poised to become a plasma cell or a memory cell type. The finding that forced expression of BCL-6 inhibits plasma cell differentiation and allows for sustained proliferation of activated B cells was confirmed in other species including non-human primates, rabbits, llamas, and mice.",

This enzyme mediates two important processes in GC B cells -SHM and CSR (26) . AID is functional in BCL-6-expressing B cells as cloned lines of BCL-6-expressing human B cells show mutations in the IgG H and L chains of the monoclonal antibody accumulating over time. Intriguingly, however, CSR does not occur in the BCL-6+ B cells indicating that SHM and CSR are differentially regulated. That CSR and SHM use different domains of AID and therefore can be uncoupled from SHM and gene conversion has been shown before. However, the mechanisms underlying the lack of CSR in B cells that undergo SHM is presently unknown. Taken together, BCL-6 seems to be a master regulator conferring a GC phenotype and function to peripheral blood memory B cells.",

            "text": "Observations in patients suffering from an autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) have established a critical role of STAT3 in the regulation of B-cell maturation. AD-HIES is caused by mutations in STAT3 resulting in expression of dominant negative STAT3 which reduces STAT3 function (27, 28) . These patients show a high susceptibility to microbial pathogens due to deficiencies in the functions of a variety of immune cells. T-cell-dependent antibody production is strongly affected. Although STAT3 deficiency impairs the function of T follicular helper cells, thereby hampering B-cell help (29) , deficiencies in STAT3 function also intrinsically affect the capacity of B cells to differentiate into antibody-secreting plasmablasts (30) . There are several cytokines that can induce STAT3 in activated B cells including IL-10 and IL-21. Of those, IL-21 is most likely the dominant STAT3 inducer in B cells as patients with IL-21R mutations have deficiencies in antibody responses (31) . Moreover, IL-21 most strongly induces expression of PDRM1 and XBP-1 in activated naive and memory B cells resulting in plasma cell differentiation and increased antibody production (11, 32) . To study the effects of STAT3 activation in the absence of cytokine signaling, we followed the same approach as with STAT5, expressing a fusion of STAT3 with a mutated domain of ER in activated B cells and examined the response of these cells following incubation with 4 HT. These experiments revealed that activation of STAT3 itself increased expression of BLIMP1 and XBP1 similar to IL-21, suggesting that these transcription factors are controlled by STAT3 (11) . However, whereas BCL-6 was induced by IL-21, it was not induced by STAT3. Because IL-21 transiently induces STAT5 phosphorylation and BCL6 is a direct target of STAT5 in human B cells (15) , it is likely that IL-21 regulates BCL-6 through STAT5. However, STAT5 and BCL-6 are not sustained by IL-21, and eventually B cells cultured with IL-21 and CD40L differentiate terminally to plasma cells (11) .",

By forced expression of BCL-6 into B cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, we prevent those cells from differentiating into plasma cells in a culture system with CD40L-expressing mouse fibroblasts and cytokines. However, the pool of B cells expressing BCL-6 expanded very slowly probably caused by the fact that many cells were dying. To offset cell death, we examined whether co-expression of gene fragments encoding antiapoptotic molecules would prevent cell death of BCL-6-transduced cells. Indeed co-expression of a variety of genes encoding BCL-2 family members resulted in a strong inhibition of death of BCL-6-transduced cells. The best effect was observed with BCL-XL but BCL-2 and MCL1 were also effective (data not shown).",

Prophylactic treatment of children may therefore result in a significant reduction in wheezing days during the first year of life and the development of asthma later in life (45, 52) . The high-dose requirements of palivizumab make this medicine less useful for treatment of large groups of newborns and treatment is only possible for very young infants weighing less than 4 kg. Therefore, the search for other medicines and for more potent neutralizing antibodies continues.",

Using our B-cell immortalization technology, we set out to identify RSV-specific antibodies better or equally potent as palivizumab. In order to screen directly on neutralizing activity, we developed a sensitive high-throughput neutralization assay using a fluorescent-based detection method to distinguish and quantify infected from non-infected cells. Using memory IgG+ B cells derived from peripheral blood from healthy individuals including daycare providers who should be frequently exposed to respiratory viruses, we isolated a series of B-cell clones producing RSV F-specific antibodies (12) . Of these antibodies, D25, AM23, and AM14 neutralize RSV A and B strains with a potency 100-fold greater than palivizumab. We demonstrated that these antibodies are specific for an F structural determinant that is not present on inactivated virus or viral lysates. The reason for this was unraveled when McLellan et al. determined the exact structure of the F protein by crystallography. It became clear that the structure targeted by the antibodies D25, AM23, and AM14 was the prefusion F trimer (53) . The epitope on F recognized by D25 was annotated as the \u00f8 domain, which is an epitope located at the membrane-distal apex of the RSV F glycoprotein, and thereby D25 locks the F protein in its prefusion state. AM14 is binding another quaternary epitope between 2 F protomers making it extremely specific for binding prefusion F trimers (54) . In vitro, these F-specific antibodies neutralize a broad selection of subgroup A and subgroup B RSV clinical isolates. The advantage of prefusion-specific antibodies is that they only recognize F protein in its native conformation on virus particles and on infected cells and do not recognize free monomeric protein which is probably more abundantly present during infection and may serve as a sink for antibodies like palivizumab which recognize both pre-and postfusion F structures. Antibodies D25, AM23, and AM14 also have potent in vivo activity in cotton rats (12) .",

To give full protection after birth, the serum half-life of MEDI8897 is prolonged by specific YTE mutations in the Fc tail thereby increasing its affinity for the FcRn receptor. This should keep serum antibody levels high enough to give protection for the whole RSV season (55) . This was confirmed in a phase I study in which the YTE mutation resulted in an astonishing half-life of the modified D25 antibody of 90 days. It is therefore likely that only one injection during the RSV season is sufficient to confer protection whereas four injections of palivizumab are needed to confer protection. This protection against RSV disease in early life is important to prevent serious damage to the lungs and recurrent wheezing as discussed above.",

The search for human H5N1 neutralizing antibodies resulted in the isolation of the antibodies CR6261 (65) and F10 (66) that neutralized most group 1 influenza viruses.

This is mediated by binding of the antibody to a conserved hydrophobic pocket in the stem domain of HA (HA2). Both human antibodies employ the heavy chain germline gene VH1-69 and bind solely via the heavy chain; the light chain is not involved.

B cells binding the labeled protein were isolated and cultured after which the antibody containing culture supernatants were tested for their cross-binding potential for H3 and H7 HA. This procedure let to the identification by our group of antibodies 40C7, which was renamed CR8020 (36, 37) , and 55B4 (CR8043) (37) , which were the first human broadly reacting group 2 influenza-specific antibodies identified.

As for the broadly neutralizing group 1 antibodies, CR8020 and CR8043 do not inhibit viral infection by prohibiting host receptor binding but they block the conformational changes in the HA protein needed for viral membrane fusion and inhibit HA processing (36, 37) .

AT10-002 is the most potent antibody and shows neutralizing capacity for all group 2 influenza subtypes tested (38) .

Employing the activity of AID, one can select B cells that have mutations in the immunoglobulins they produce. Using the AID-expressing chicken-derived DT40 cell line and Ramos B cells (74) , sub-lines were generated which recognize several different antigens, even though these B cells express a single rearranged Ig gene. Using mammalian cell display, affinity maturation can be mimicked in vitro by co-expressing antibody and AID in the HEK293 cell line.

Sequence analysis of transduced B cells revealed that mutations are present in the Ig locus and that they are mainly localized in the CDRs and framework region-3 indicating that the occurrence of these mutations was site-directed and not random. The Ig variable mutation rate in transduced B cells is between 8.85 9 10 \u00c05 and 5.14 9 10 \u00c05 mutations per base pair per cell division, which is at the lower end of the estimated AID-mediated mutation rate in vivo (1 9 10 \u00c03 to 1 9 10 \u00c05 ) (77). This ongoing somatic hypermutation does not lead to the loss specificity of the whole B-cell pool as mutated B cells only form a very small part of the total population of cultured BCL6/BCL-XL-transduced B cells. To retrieve the small subset of mutated B cells within this pool, we stain the cells with labeled antigen and isolate those cells with either low or high binding avidity by flow cytometry (Fig. 2) . This way we isolated subclones that produced antibodies with five to 10-fold higher affinities than the parental antibody. It has been documented that AID expression is controlled by the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor E47. The activity of this transcription factor can be inhibited by Id2 and Id3, which bind to E47 forming an inactive complex (78) . As a consequence, overexpression of helix-loop-helix factor inhibitor of DNA binding-3 (Id3) strongly reduced AICDA transcripts thereby providing a method to prevent AID-induced mutations.",

We explored if immortalization by introduction of BCL-6 and BCL-XL could also be applied to non-human species. B-cell immortalization could be achieved for nonhuman primates (12) , mouse, llama, and rabbit B cells ( Table 1 ). Particularly retroviral transduction of rabbit B cells was very efficient (90%) ( Table 1 and Fig. 3 ) and immortalized rabbit cells grow very rapidly with an average doubling time of 18 h, compared to 25-29 h for human cells ( Table 1 and Fig. 3) . This allows the analysis of the complete B-cell repertoire within a very short time period.

Thus antigen-specific sorting allows focusing on the B-cell population of interest. H3sorted clones were subsequently tested for binding to H7 virus-infected cells to investigate if rabbit immunization resulted in the development of rare cross-binding clones. Indeed we could identify one clone that showed cross-binding to H3 and H7, corresponding to a frequency of 1 per 60,000. Due to the fast doubling time of the immortalized rabbit B cells over 200 HA-specific, IgG+ B cell clones were obtained within 3 weeks of blood draw. As expected for rabbit antibodies, the affinities of individual antibodies were extremely high, up to 4 pM and the fact that the animals were not sacrificed allows for sequential sample taking and analysis. In a similar experiment where we were aiming to obtain peptide-specific monoclonal antibodies, we obtained antibodies recognizing a FLAG tag or a peptide from the estrogen receptor with EC 50 s between 0.5 and 10 ng/ml in ELISA (data not shown).

These researchers first determined the spectrum of mutated proteins of a melanoma by exome sequencing and made a library encompassing peptides that contained the mutations. They then screened pools of peptides for their capacity to stimulate interferon-c production by autologous T cells. As antigen-presenting cell, they used BCL6/BCL-XL-transduced B cells established from the patient. Importantly, these immortalized B cells did not activate autologous T cells in the absence of neoantigens. By contrast, EBV-transformed B cells derived from patient's B cells stimulate EBV antigen-specific T cells which mask the response to neoantigens (84) showing the importance of the BCL-6/BCL-XL-transduced B cells in this strategy. Neoantigens could also be found by screenings using monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) (85) but those DC cannot be expanded in vitro, in contrast to BCL-6/BCL-XL-transduced B cells, limiting their use in large-scale high-throughput screening.",

            "text": "We describe here how activated B cells can be immortalized by a simple genetic modification. Nearly the complete B-cell repertoire is captured using a highly efficient transduction of a retroviral construct harboring BCL6 and BCL-XL. The immortalized B cells are stable and can be readily cloned, frozen, and thawed without loss of their antibody-producing capacities. BCL6/BCL-XL-transduced B cells have a plasmablast-like phenotype secreting antibodies in the supernatant and expressing the BCR on their surface, which makes them an excellent source for the discovery of monoclonal antibodies. Libraries encompassing hundreds of thousands of B cells can be established from individuals who produce exceptional antibodies, facilitating rapid antibody discovery and allowing investigators to search for rare B cells that make unique antibodies. We have discussed examples of broadly reacting highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against pathogenic viruses that were isolated from selected individuals. The method can also easily be applied to probe the B-cell repertoire of cancer patients who respond favorably to immunotherapies for antibodies that recognize tumor antigens. We have already been able to identify antibodies from B cells of cancer patients that recognize new and unexpected targets on the cell surface of tumor cells. Future work in this area should provide us not only with a better understanding of the contribution of B cells to the immune response against malignant cells but will also allow the discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies.",

One example concerns the function of AID in BCL-6/BCL-XL-transduced B cells. Surprisingly, SHM are observed in these cells but not CSR, indicating that yet to be identified signals are required for AID-mediated CSR. Aside from the scientific questions that AID expression in BCL-6/BCL-XL-transduced B cells raises, we could use this feature to generate subclones of antigenspecific B cells that secrete antibodies with either higher or lower affinities than of the antibody produced by the parental clone, thereby offering a method to affinity mature antibodies without the need for extensive molecular engineering.",
