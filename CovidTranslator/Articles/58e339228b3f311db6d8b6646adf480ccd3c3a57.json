Specimens were submitted to the clinical laboratory for routine testing for respiratory viruses, which comprised direct fluorescent antigen assay (DFA) and culture. All specimens received in the laboratory were set up for routine examination, and the remaining material was immediately formed into aliquots and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further testing. The first 25 specimens received each week for a 24-week period were selected, for a total of 600 specimens from 2007 to 2008. The same method was used in 2009 to obtain a further 150 specimens. In preparation for PCR, a single aliquot of each specimen was thawed and extracted on the biorobot M48 workstation using the MagAttract Virus Mini M48 kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and eluted in 100 \u03bcL of elution buffer. The DNA obtained was divided into six aliquots and immediately frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further testing. One aliquot from each specimen was subsequently tested by each of four different nucleic acid amplification-based assays: ResPlex II v2.0 (Qiagen); Seeplex RV15 kit (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea); xTAG-RVP and xTAG-RVP Fast Luminex, Austin, TX). These assays together detect up to 18 respiratory viruses: RSV (A, B), OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1, rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/ENT), coxsackie/ echovirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) (1-4), FLU-A, FLU-B, HBoV, adenovirus (ADV) (A, B, C, D, F) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). ResPlex II v2.0 and Seeplex RV15 assays distinguished HRV from ENT, whereas xTAG-RVP and xTAG-RVP fast assays reported a combined result of HRV/ENT as reported in our study. All specimens were also examined by DFA for 8 respiratory viruses: RSV, FLU A/FLU B, PIV 1-3, ADV (SimulFluor, Millipore, Temecula, CA) and hMPV (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, OH)) and/or virus culture. We defined a positive viral result as truly positive if the sample tested positive by virus culture regardless of other tests, or by DFA and at least one molecular test or by two different molecular tests. For viruses that are only detectable by molecular assays (HRV/ENT, coronaviruses, HBoV and PIV 4), a truly positive result was defined as two or more positive test results from the four molecular assays [11] .",

The \u03c7 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables between groups as appropriate.

Our rate of coinfection (17.2%) was similar to those of other studies [12] [13] [14] but higher than that reported by one study [15] . Discrepancy in rates of coinfection ranging from 12% to 50% [12] [13] [14] [15] may result from the population studied (infants vs. older children; differing proportions and types of underlying comorbidities) as an underlying respiratory conditions (asthma, cystic fibrosis) may result in higher rates of coinfection. As in some studies [12] [13] [14] 16, 17] , HRV/ENT and RSV were the most common pathogens identified in our cohort, mostly as single virus infections. In contrast, two studies [12, 13] , which focused on severe acute respiratory illness in children in South Africa, reported HRV/ENT and RSV most frequently in coinfection with at least another virus, suggesting that the population studied (developing vs. developed countries; infants vs. older children) and the proportion of children with severe respiratory illness may influence the rates of documented coinfection. We report no association between virus status and various measures of clinical disease severity. Studies focusing on the severity of virus coinfection have resulted in divergent findings. Possible explanations include variation in age groups, breadth of illness severity, the proportion with underlying conditions and their adjustment in multivariable analyses. When analysed by virus pathogen, we reported higher rates of hospitalization and increased clinical disease severity among hospitalized children with HRV/ENT infection alone compared to those coinfected with HRV/ENT and at least another virus, although this was not statistically significant in multivariable analysis. However, our small sample size of HRV/ENT-positive patients may have limited our findings in multivariable analyses, thus still suggesting that HRV/ENT-positive status may remain an independent predictor for severity. Underlying cardiorespiratory conditions, immunodeficiency and metabolic disorders, which were overrepresented among children with single virus infection, remained the most important predictors for severe disease as reported in our multivariable analyses. As suggested in other studies [18, 19] , subjects coinfected with RSV and at least another virus (especially RSV-HBoV) in our cohort had higher rates of pneumonia compared to those with RSV infection alone. Possible explanations include increased inflammatory markers induced by the presence of multiple viruses thus favouring progression to pneumonia. Given our low rates of bacteria coinfection, their contribution to the development of lower respiratory tract infection was minor.",

The impact of underlying comorbidities on clinical severity was addressed by multivariable analysis. Finally, our study enabled more extensive comparison groups (single vs. coinfection HRV/ ENT, RSV) each with adequate sample sizes, although our sample size did not allow subgroup analyses for all individual viruses, influenza included. Given our low rate of detected bacteria coinfection, no adjustment for this variable was done in multivariable analyses. Potential limitations of our study relate to its retrospective design, which may have led to selection bias, as not all consecutive patients were tested for respiratory viruses. However, the random selection of the respiratory samples tested by molecular assays reduced the risk of selection bias. Second, we assessed presence or absence of single infection or virus coinfection, but we did not measure their virus load, which might have helped elucidate the association between HRV/ENT and severe disease, as rhinoviruses can be detected in up to 25% of asymptomatic patients [1, 3, 16] . However, inconsistency of the matrix between individuals may limit comparison of virus loads between patients. Finally, our estimation of bacteria coinfection may have been underestimated, as BAL are rarely performed in children and pneumonia rarely results in positive blood cultures. This limitation inherent to studies assessing the severity of respiratory illnesses in children may be overcome in future studies, which may incorporate novel diagnostic approaches such as nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics analysis of urine for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia [20] .",
