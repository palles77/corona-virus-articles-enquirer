Governments had little idea what they were dealing with, and accurate information was in short supply. In this information vacuum, the media had little choice but to fill in the gaps in what BBC presenter Nik Gowing once described as 'the race for space'.

Why did the Ministry not wait until x-ray tests -the WHO standard -proved conclusively that the worker had SARS, before going to the media? Surely, it realised the pronouncement -no matter how many qualifying comments accompanied it -would only trigger unwarranted fears of a return of the SARS epidemic and a blood-letting on regional stock markets? The Ministry, for its part, argued there were much bigger issues at stake. Quick action and public awareness were critical factors in preventing the spread of deadly, highly contagious diseases, it argued. As soon as there was sufficient evidence to suggest SARS had reemerged, it was time to go public. Plus, the Ministry said, it was made clear at the conference that this was an isolated case.

Truth is an early casualty in many crises, and professional reputation management tools are required to dispel myths and misperceptions before they take root in the public consciousness. Ideally, Phoenix would have started earlier. By June, when the project launched, much of the damage had been done, resulting in a focus of recovery rather than prevention, or at least damage control.
