            "text": "Introduction: The research of auxiliary diagnosis has always been one of the hotspots in the world. The implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm for medical text data faces challenges with interpretability and creditability. The improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques means not only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also the further study of diagnostic basis. Traditional research methods for diagnostic markers often require a large amount of time and economic costs. Research objects are often dozens of samples, and it is, therefore, difficult to synthesize large amounts of data. Therefore, the comprehensiveness and reliability of traditional methods have yet to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of a model that can automatically diagnose diseases and automatically provide a diagnostic basis at the same time has a positive effect on the improvement of medical diagnostic techniques. Methods: Here, we established an auxiliary diagnostic tool based on attention deep learning algorithm to diagnostic hyperlipemia and automatically predict the corresponding diagnostic markers using hematological parameters. In this paper, we not only demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to automatically diagnose diseases using text-based medical data, such as physiological parameters, but also demonstrated its ability to forecast disease diagnostic markers. Human physiological parameters are used as input to the model, and the doctor's diagnosis results as an output. Through the attention layer, the degree of attention of the model to different physiological parameters can be obtained, that is, the model provides a diagnostic basis. Results: It achieved 94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with the test dataset. All the above samples are drawn from clinical practice. Moreover, the model predicted the diagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia by the attention mechanism, and the results were fully agreeable to the golden criteria. Discussion: The auxiliary diagnosis system proposed in this paper not only achieves the accurate and robust performance, and can be used for the preliminary diagnosis of patients, but also showing its great potential to discover new diagnostic markers. Therefore, it not only can improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis but also shorten the research period of researching a diagnosis basis to an extent. It has a positive significance to the development of the medical diagnosis level.",

            "text": "In recent years, with the gradual awakening of global health awareness, human beings have shown an urgent need for further development of the medical level. [1] [2] [3] Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential to promote the further development of medical diagnostic technology because of its excellent performance in the field of data processing beyond human experts. Despite it has an excellent performance in the field of automatic diagnosis using medical images, the interpretability and text-based medical data analyzability of AI still faces great challenges. 4, 5, 45 In order to solve the problems above, on the global scale, researchers have gradually integrated deep learning technology with a medical diagnosis. Edward Choi and his colleagues used a recurrent neural network to process electronic health records (EHR) for diagnosing heart failure onset. 6 Laila Rasmy et al used recurrent neural networks to predict the risk of heart failure based on a large number of mixed EHR data. 7 Sasank Chilamkurthy et al used natural language processing model to recognize noncontrast head CT scan to identify various head diseases, such as intracranial haemorrhages and cranial fractures et al. 8 Kang Zhang et al used transfer learning algorithm and Google's Inception-V3 model to rapidly diagnose many kinds of diseases of eye and children pulmonary diseases. 9 Michael A. Schwemmer et al used a deep neural network decoding framework to classify intracortical recording, and then controlled the motor to help patients complete corresponding actions, according to the classification results. 10 Although deep learning technology has shown a strong competitive advantage in the field of automatic diagnosis using medical images, it still faces many major challenges, such as processing medical text information. In the actual clinical diagnosis processing, in addition to the diseases that can be diagnosed by medical images, there are many diseases that need to be diagnosed by medical text data, such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, etc. 11, 12 In order to realize the purpose of automatically diagnosing diseases using text-based medical data, long-short time memory (LSTM) neural network was proposed. 13, 14 The physiological parameters obtained in the clinic are usually a vector rather than image data. Sequential data also play an important role in clinical diagnosis. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is more suitable for processing image data because of its translation invariance. Because of the need to learn the interrelationship between different physiological parameters, LSTM is a good choice when processing sequence data.",

            "text": "LSTM mentioned above relying on memory cells to learn long-range dependence information. As we know, each human physiological parameter is not independent, they are interrelated, and this relationship is difficult to be found by simple coding or logistic regression algorithm. Therefore, we need a deep learning model that can learn the relationship better of far apart data to complete the task of processing text-based medical data. Simply, the LSTM neural network takes the original text-based medical data as input, and then use many special neurons to extract the joint features automatically from the original data, and finally use the classification function to classify the samples automatically to achieve the purpose of automatic diagnosis of diseases. This architecture makes it possible to process medical text data which have complex internal relationships, deep learning technology has been widely used in various fields. 15, 16 The deep learning technology-based text data classification method replaces the mathematical distance-based traditional clustering method, which greatly improves the performance of the model in processing text data. The key elements of traditional automatic diagnosis method using medical text data are: (1) patient description pathological characteristics, (2) researchers extract features manually based on patient descriptions or patient's EHR, (3) the extracted features are encoded according to the requirements, (4) classification algorithm is used to classify the coded physiological features. 17 The traditional automatic diagnosis method needs to extract features manually, and the quality of extracted feature vectors is greatly affected by the researcher's clinical experience and professional level, so it has uncertainty. At the same time, the traditional method will lose some original information artificially in the process of feature extraction, which may lose some joint features of physiological parameters, so the traditional method also has a degree of one-sidedness. Although it is not only the pathological features described by patients, EHR are also widely used in the research of automatic diagnosis. But there is no objective and unified standard to evaluate the quality of EHR. This is one of the important factors that limit the performance of automatic diagnosis algorithms using EHR. 18, 20 Deep learning algorithm has the ability of feature extraction automatically, so it overcomes the one-sidedness caused by manual feature extraction, saves labor resources and improves the efficiency and accuracy of automatic diagnosis. [20] [21] [22] Another challenge in applying deep learning algorithms to auxiliary diagnosis is the interpretability. Up to now, the deep learning model is still a black-box model, which cannot explain exactly which kind of physiological parameters plays a vital role in the process of data processing. The development of disease diagnosis technology depends not only on the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also on the discovery of more effective diagnostic markers and the relationship between different physiological parameters (diseases). It is difficult to meet the requirements above by the auxiliary diagnosis system which only gives the diagnosis results. As we know, the human brain tends to have an attention focus when processing things, and it is able to find out important features purposefully according to the environment, this mechanism is called the attention mechanism. The combination of attention mechanism and deep learning model can imitate the functions of the human brain mentioned above, which has been proved to have the ability to focus on important features and has been applied in many fields such as image recognition and semantic recognition. [23] [24] [25] Therefore, in order to solve the above problems, this paper not only studies the automatic diagnosis of diseases with human physiological parameters, but also applies the attention mechanism to the auxiliary diagnosis model. This method gives the importance of different physiological parameters for disease diagnosis while automatically diagnosing diseases, enhances the interpretability of the model, and further enhances the assistant ability of the auxiliary diagnosis system for clinical research. This algorithm is called attention deep learning.",

            "text": "The advancement of medical diagnostic techniques should not rely solely on the improvement of diagnostic accuracy, but should also rely on the study of diagnostic markers or diagnostic basis that are more effective. Therefore, research on the prediction of diagnostic markers is of great significance. The traditional method of studying diagnostic markers is often to collect dozens of sample data, and to predict the diagnostic markers according to the regression model, it is difficult to synthesize large quantities of samples. The above situation has caused the traditional research methods to have certain blindness and subjectivity. In order to solve the above series of problems, an auxiliary diagnostic system that can automatically provide disease markers while automatically diagnosing diseases is of positive significance for the development of medical level. Hyperlipidemia refers to the excessive level of blood lipids, which can directly cause some diseases that seriously endanger human health, such as coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis and so on. However, due to the absence of obvious symptoms and abnormal signs, the diseases mentioned above have strong concealment and are difficult to be detected purposefully. At the same time, with the continuous development of medical level, researchers have found that more and more diseases are highly related to hyperlipidemia, such as AIDS, depression and so on. 26, 27 Therefore, in the world, hyperlipidemia has become one of the most important diseases threatening human life and health to a large extent. Although there is no uniform international standard for the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hematological parameters are widely used in the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia and the evaluation of treatment methods, which is capable of use hematological parameters to automatically diagnose hyperlipidemia. [28] [29] [30] [31] In this paper, we sought to propose an auxiliary diagnosis algorithm that can not only diagnose hyperlipidemia rapidly and accurately according to human hematological parameters but also provide diagnostic markers automatically, which improves the objectivity of traditional methods and the interpretability of deep learning model algorithm. Compared with previous work, our proposed new model not only automatically determines the patient's health but also automatically provides diagnostic markers. Compared with the auxiliary diagnostic system that only provides the diagnosis result, the new model proposed in this paper has higher interpretability and credibility. Therefore, the above model can not only speed up the patient's medical treatment process but also further improve research efficiency of diagnostic markers, and have great potential for discovering new diagnostic markers. Artificial intelligence aided diagnosis system can effectively simplify the process of patients seeking medical treatment, alleviate the contradiction of lack of medical resources, and improve the survival rate of emergency patients, as shown in Figure 1 .",

Compared with EHR without unified evaluation standards, this paper used human hematological parameters which had unified standards as training data, so that the algorithm has higher reliability. Our attention deep learning algorithm has been preliminarily applied to the automatic diagnosis of hyperlipidemia with hematological parameters; the corresponding diagnostic markers and the significance of different markers are given at the same time. The hematological parameters used in this study include cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, hemoglobin and red blood cells. Despite different blood parameters are often obtained by different methods, their acquisition methods have a unified standard. These parameters can reflect different health conditions of human body. 32, 33 At the same time, compared with the auxiliary diagnostic method which only provides diagnostic results, the algorithm proposed by this paper can also predict the diagnostic markers of diseases and the corresponding importance automatically, which improve the possibility of finding more effective new diagnostic markers, and accelerate the development of medical diagnostic technology further. This paper compares the results of the model's automatic prediction with the gold standard. Although no new diagnostic markers were obtained using limited data, it proved that the model has the potential to reasonably predict the diagnostic basis. Our work is the first time to systematically study an artificial intelligence aided diagnosis system that integrates automatic diagnosis and automatic prediction diagnostic markers, which is of great significance to the development of medical level. The improvement of recognition accuracy does not mean the improvement of medical diagnosis, but also the explanation of disease mechanism. Increasing the interpretability of the model will further improve the diagnostic level of the disease. 34 In addition, a method that can automatically process a large number of samples and provide biomarkers can speed up the study of disease mechanism. In conclusion, the combination of deep learning technology and medical diagnostic technology is of great significance for disease research.",

Although EHR data are widely used in the research of auxiliary diagnostic system, there is no unified standard to evaluate the quality of EHR data at present. The EHR data include artificial description, which limits the credibility of EHR data, which is also one of the important factors limiting the further improvement of model performance. Moreover, because EHR data does not have a uniform format, it is necessary to extract features manually before data are utilized, which not only causes the loss of original information but also increases labor costs. In the training process of this model, physiological parameters with standardized criteria were applied to the training of the model, and there was no manual description process. At the same time, the proposed model does not need to manually extract features, so that the model can obtain more potentially useful information, thus improving the performance of the model and increasing the reliability of the model. In addition, the explanation of disease mechanism and biomarker should be added. Only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy can be used to prove that the improvement of medical diagnostic technology is not very comprehensive.

It achieved 63% ACC with the same testing dataset. The SVM which used sigmoid kernel function polynomial kernel achieved 50% ACC and 81% ACC in the same testing data, respectively. Fully connected neural network achieved 89% ACC with test data mentioned above. We speculated that it is due to the fact that the traditional classification method is difficult to learn the relationship between different physiological parameters and cannot learn the importance of different physiological parameters for disease. Each physiological parameter is not independent. Actually, the parameters interact with each other. One physiological parameter is the same, while the other physiological parameters are different, which may reflect different health conditions. Different physiological parameters are interrelated in physiological mechanism. Like the semantic environment, the same words have different interpretations in different semantic environments. For example, when both lipids and HDL are high, patients may experience a temporary increase in blood lipids due to diet rather than hyperlipidemia. Moreover, HDL reflects the synthesis of lipid metabolism, and it is not the higher the better. We also compared the performance of the simple recurrent neural network (RNN) with the model proposed by this paper. This RNN model also used the Adam algorithm to update global parameters. It achieved 93% ACC in the test dataset mentioned above. The performance of these two models is very close. However, LSTM can better synthesize the relationship between different physiological parameters to give a judgment, and the simple RNN model only considers the state at the nearest moment. The more complex the data processed, the more obvious the difference in performance between the two models. We also found similar work in the limited range. Manjeevan Seeraa 37 and his colleges classify transcranial Doppler signals using individual and ensemble RNN, it archives 85.52% AUC. These works have also achieved good results in the test set. However, we speculate that human physiological features are not independent, it is not sufficient to consider only one parameter which is the reason for the better performance of LSTM that can analyze joint characteristics. 38, 40 Therefore, LSTM is a better choice for dealing with physiological parameter sequences with complex intrinsic relationships, similar to the recognition of semantic environments or voice signals.",

            "text": "Further, the above studies on the auxiliary diagnostic system show good performance in the test set, but do not provide the basis for model classification data. The development of medical diagnosis depends not only on the improvement of diagnosis accuracy but also on the researching diagnostic markers, diagnostic basis or the influence of different physiological parameters on diseases. Compared with previous work, this paper proposed a deep learning model that integrated the attention mechanism. By using the attention mechanism, we could observe which physiological parameters are more important for disease diagnosis. Model can automatically provide disease diagnostic markers while diagnosing diseases. When using only LSTM, we found that the model reached 92% ACC in the same test dataset. We suspect that this is because the use of the attentional mechanism can help the model process more efficient information purposefully, thus alleviating the problem of over-fitting. In addition, the use of attention mechanism is more convenient for the study of diagnostic markers, which can effectively reflect the importance of different physiological parameters for disease diagnosis. The performance is very close. We speculate that this is because the data is not very complex. In the future, we will study and use more types of physiological parameters to identify more complex diseases. As shown in Figure 10 , in the process of diagnosing hyperlipidemia, the model mainly judged hyperlipidemia according to cholesterol and triglyceride. This phenomenon coincides with the diagnostic criteria of hyperlipidemia. At the same time, HDL was also found to be associated with hyperlipidemia. We speculate that this phenomenon is due to the fact that HDL functions as a carrier of cholesterol in the surrounding tissues, so it has a close relationship with hyperlipidemia. 40, 41 The model mentioned above not only shows a high correlation between hyperlipidemia and direct markers, but also provide indirect markers. This phenomenon not only shows that the model proposed in this paper can learn the relationship between different physiological parameters but also shows that the model has great potential to discover new diagnostic markers. Although the model does not give new diagnostic markers using limited data, the prediction results of the model are in line with the gold standard, which proves the reliability of the model, and the model has the potential to reasonably analyze more evidence for disease diagnosis. As shown in Figure 10 , although the model pays little attention to the remaining items, in fact, the attention is not zero. We speculate that this is due to there is a correlation between human different physiological parameters. The model shows a strong concern for the physiological parameters directly related to disease, but does not give high attention to the physiological parameters not related to disease, such as red blood cells, which further proves the reliability of the model. By using the visualization method, the diagnostic basis of the auxiliary diagnostic model can be clearly presented, which improve a certain degree of transparency to the black-box model. The AI diagnosis system proposed in this paper not only provided accurate and robust diagnosis results but also provided the diagnostic basis of diseases (94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with test dataset). It not only increases the intelligence of the model but also broadens the application scope of the system, such as medical teaching (provide recommended diagnosis results and evidence to inexperienced physicians). Most importantly, the traditional method of researching diagnostic markers is often to observe the clinical manifestations of dozens or hundreds of patients artificially, and then find the diagnostic markers of diseases according to the method of statistics. The traditional methods mentioned above are often difficult to synthesize large quantities of data and have a long research cycle. 42, 43 Andrei M. Beliaevc et al used 96 patients samples to discover diagnostic markers of acute cholangitis. Akihiko Yuki et al found CADM1 is a diagnostic marker in early-stage mycosis fungoides with 58 cases. 44 Their research results have achieved good performance. Artificial analysis of limited data (dozens of samples) has the characteristics of one-sidedness and long research time, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty of researching diagnostic markers. The auxiliary diagnostic system proposed in this paper can automatically provide diagnostic markers by integrating a large amount of clinical data, which reduces the blindness of researching diagnostic markers and speeds up the discovery process of new diagnostic markers to a certain extent. In addition, automatic analysis of large quantities of samples can improve the reliability of the model and reduce the contingency caused by small quantities of samples.",

Another limitation is that the diagnosis of many chronic diseases is also related to many other types of information, such as sex, age, disease history, family history and so on.

This phenomenon proves that it has the potential to discover new diagnostic markers, and expands the application scope of the auxiliary diagnostic system. At the same time, the experimental results show that the algorithm also has the capability to learn the relationship between different physiological parameters, so it has a high generalization ability. Therefore, it can save medical resources, speed up the researching process of diagnostic markers to a certain extent, speed up the work efficiency of the hospital, and enhance the patient's medical experience. Increasing the explanatory power of the model can effectively increase the research on biomarkers. 34 The future work is still around to improve the performance of the auxiliary diagnostic system. In order to further improve the accuracy of the model, we will consider how to input more types of data into the model, such as patient history, etc. At the same time, in order to diagnose more kinds of diseases, we will collect more data to expand our existing data set. Because there are some complex diseases that require a joint judgment of multiple types of diagnostic information, we will study how to use cross-media diagnostic data as an input training model in the next step. Due to the limited data types, no new diagnostic markers are proposed in this model. Although the experiment confirmed that the diagnostic markers predicted by the model were the same as the gold standard, we will add more physiological parameter types and multiple diseases in the future work, with a view to finding more disease-related biomarkers. Not only in medicine but also from the perspective of engineering, we will further study the optimization methods of auxiliary diagnostic systems, such as the adjustment methods of hyperparameters. We will also further expand the sample data, consider more factors that may influence the diagnosis of the disease such as different races, diverse age groups et al to further enhance the reliability of the model.",
