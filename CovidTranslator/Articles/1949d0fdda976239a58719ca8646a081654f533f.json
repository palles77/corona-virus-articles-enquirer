Both methods resulted in the same grouping data. So the grouping method based on HVR 1 could represent the grouping method based on the whole S1 gene. Taiwan isolates could not be placed within the existing groups. In order to test the correlation between genotype and serotype, a one-way neutralization test was used to compare 9 Taiwan isolates selected from different genotypes with Massachusetts (Mass) (H120) and Connecticut (Conn) standard strains. In addition, a two-way cross-neutralization test was performed in embryonated eggs with the \u2424 method (constant-virus, dilutedserum) and the reciprocal neutralization titers were calculated to give the relatedness (r) values. The results of two kinds of neutralizing tests showed that the serotypes of 9 isolates were different from Mass or Conn. Based on the r-values, 9 isolates were divided into two serotypes which were correlated with their genotypes. From pathogenicity tests, IBV Taiwan isolates could be divided into high, intermediate, and low pathogenicity according to their pathogenicity indexes. However, no relationship exists between pathotype and genotype. In conclusion, the genetic typing method based on HVR 1 can be used for typing IBV isolates.",

The antibody to IBV for the sera from one-day-old were determined to be free by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system using KPL kits (Kirkegaard and Perry Labs, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Groups of 10 chicks were inoculated at one day of age by the intranasal route with 10 4.3 \u223c 10 6.0 EID 50 of the nine IBV isolates. The same amount of tryptose phosphate broth was inoculated into control chicks. After inoculation, the chicks were observed daily for 14 days, and clinical signs and mortality were recorded. At the end of the experiments, the survivors were killed humanely. The dead chicks and the chicks killed were necropsied. The clinical sign scores, lesion scores of infected chickens, as well as the pathogenicity of IBV isolates were calculated and interpreted according to the methods described by Avellaneda et al. [3] with small modifications. Briefly, the clinical signs system used was as follows: 0 = no clinical signs; 1 = lacrimation, slight head shaking and watery feces; 2 = lacrimation, presence of nasal exudate, depression, watery feces; 3 = same as 2 but stronger, severe watery feces. Lesions in trachea were evaluated as follows: 0 = no lesions; 1 = slight increase of mucin; 2 = large increase of mucin; 3 = large increase of mucin and mucosal congestion. Lesions in the kidney were evaluated as follows: 0 = no lesions; 1 = swelling, urate visible only under stereomicroscopy; 2 = swelling with urate; 3 = same as 2 with large amount of urate deposit in kidney. The pathogenicity index = no. of chicks with lesion score \u2265 1 + 1 point for every 10% mortality. Based on the values of these indexes, the isolates were divided into three pathogenicity groups: high (\u226519), intermediate (10\u223c18), and low (1\u223c9).

None of the nine Taiwan isolates were protected by anti-Mass or anti-Conn antisera with reducing embryo mortality by 50% or more. So the nine isolates were neither Mass nor Conn serotypes. Table 1 shows cross VN titers. Serum dilutions less than 1:4 were not determined. In general, homologous titers were higher than heterologous titers. Comparison of the homologous and heterologous titers showed that the viruses could be divided into two serotypes. The genotype TW I strains, IBV isolates A1246, A1960, A1211, A1928, A1449, A1927, and A1171 had higher titers than the isolates in Genotype Taiwan II, A2012, A2296. The r-values calculated from r1 and r2 are shown in Table 2 . Almost all the isolates had \u2264 5% values with Mass or Conn serotypes. The serotypes of Taiwan isolates differed from the two standard strains. Among the Taiwan isolates, the former seven isolates were of one serotype, and the latter two isolates belonged to another serotype. The serotype distinction was similar to that of the genetic grouping (Table 3) .",

            "text": "Wang et al. [21] grouped the published IBV into 4 distinctly genetic groups, i.e. Mass, American, European (excluding Dutch) and Dutch by analyzing the whole S1 gene. Grouping based on the C2U-C3L region matches their S1 classification (Fig. 1) . Taiwan isolates could not be classified into those 4 groups, using both grouping methods. Serologically, they are neither Mass nor Conn serotype. In our previous work, we reported a rapid method for typing IBV. In the present paper, we confirmed that the method correlates with serotyping results. The spike glycoprotein gene of IBV codes for the N-terminal S1, which induces neutralization antibody comprising approximately 520 amino acids. There are 2 HVRs in S1 subunit, which comprise 56-69 and 117-133 [5] . The residues within HVR 1 are associated with epitopes induce neutralization antibody. The HVR 1 in S1 is thought to be closely associated with major neutralization epitopes [10, 13, 15] and variation in this region correlates with serotype [5] . In addition, obtaining a short PCR product (228-231 bp) is easier than obtaining the whole S1 gene (1.6 kbp). Fortunately, there are two conserved sequences on both sides of HVR 1. Until now, all known Taiwan isolates can be amplified with this primer set. We have routinely used that primer set for genotyping our new isolates. The Taiwan isolates are divided into two groups, TW I and TW II [20] . In this paper, cross neutralization and one direction neutralization tests were performed for comparing the correlation between genotypes and serotypes. As predicted, serotyping results correlate with genotyping results, that genotyping based on HVR 1 is suitable for typing IBV, especially for nephrotropic isolates because almost all our isolates are nephrotropic [18] .",

            "text": "Archetti and Horsfall [2] expressed the degree of relatedness between viruses by a numerical value r but did not define serotypes in terms of r-values. According to other reports, two viruses are considered to be different serotypes when their r-value is less than 5% [9, 14] . However the r-values of some isolates in a serotype were not always above 5%. For example, the r-value of A1246 and A1449 was below 5% (4.6% in Table 2 ). They are considered to be the same serotype because other isolates in the same serotype had r-values higher than 5% with either of those two isolates. For reoviruses, the r-value in different serotypes is less than 10%. Those in different subtypes within a serotype give a range of 11% to 32% [8] . The subtype based on the present serologic results does not correlate with the results obtained from genotyping. Antisera to the viruses with different restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns within a group have varying titers. From the serologic r-value data, A1246 is closer to A1960 than any other isolates in the same serotype, so they beong to the same subtype. A1211 and A1928, A1449 and A1927 belong to different subtypes. In addition, A1171 is in another subtype. Although several subtypes are present, those subtypes do not correlate with their restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns. In spite of lack of correlation between the two typing methods for different subtypes, a good correlation is present among different groups. In conclusion, the genotyping method based on HVR 1 developed by our laboratory is a convenient and useful method for typing a new IBV isolate. However, the pathotypes of IBV isolates does not correspond to their genotypes based on HVR1 analysis. This phenomenon is predictable because HVR1 is responsible for neutralization epitope, not pathogenicity. The genes determining pathogenicity of IBV need further investigation.",
