            "text": "Sequence comparisons predicted a potential papain-like proteinase domain in the N-terminal cleavage product (NRP) of the large nonstructural replicase polyprotein (RP) of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV). Replacement of the predicted catalytic amino acids, Cys-783 by Set, or of His-869 by Glu, abolished cleavage of the 206K RP into a ~150K NRP and a ,-~78K C-terminal product in reticulocyte lysates, while other substitutions exerted no apparent influence on proteolysis. The proteinase-deficient mutant RPs could not be cleaved in trans by as much as an eight-fold molar excess of wild-type proteinase. Deletion experiments have excluded the possible influence on autoproteolysis of amino acid sequences t-708 and 982-1204 flanking the proteinase domain. Thus, the proteinase of TYMV with a papain-like dyad of essential amino acids has been mapped just upstream from the putative NTPase domain. Statistically significant sequence similarities with the TYMV proteinase were found for the similarly located domains of the replicase polyproteins of carlaviruses, capilloviruses, apple stem pitting virus and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus as well as for those of other tymoviruses and for the domain located downstream from the putative NTPase domain of the large polyprotein of beet necrotic yellow vein furovirus. All these domains are not significantly similar to other known proteinases, although they conserve papain-like Cys-and His-containing motifs. Thus these domains constitute a compact group of related enzymes, the tymo-like proteinases, within the proposed papainlike proteinase supergroup. The resulting alignment of 10 tymo-like proteinase sequences has revealed a third highly conserved residue -Gly (Gly821 in TYMV RP) followed by a hydrophobic residue. We speculate that all the tymo-like",

A plasmid construct derived from pEMBL19 and containing a fulllength copy of the TYMV cDNA, pTYFL7, was obtained as described [30] . A single-stranded DNA matrix for mutagenesis, MX-wt, was obtained by cloning an MroI1846-XhoI3282 blunt-ended fragment of pTYFL7 (1436 base pairs) into the EcoRI-SmaI digested and blunt-ended M13mpl8 vector.

Mutations from recombinant phages were transferred to pTYFL7 by replacement of the wild-type MroI-XhoI fragment by the mutant counterparts yielding the full-length TYMV cDNA mutants, designated pC783S, pH869E, pS925L, pK982S, and pNcoI*, respectively.

Karasev, pets. comm.).

However, it was also known that the genomes of animal Sindbis-like viruses as well as of several plant and animal viruses belonging to other supergroups encode papainlike proteinases [4] . The updated list of such viruses includes alphaviruses [3, 32] , rubiviruses [33] , corona-and artheriviruses [34, 35] , potyviruses [36] , hypovirulence-associated virus (HyAV) of the chestnut blight fungus [37, 28] ( Fig. 2A) , probably aphthoviruses [4, 39] , bymoviruses [40, 41] , hepatitis E virus [16] , and possibly, pestiviruses [42] . The proteinases of these viruses have little or no sequence similarity with each other or with cellular papain-like proteinases except for two regions, containing (putative) catalytically active Cys and His residues ( Fig. 2A ). Our analysis of the tymovirus sequences revealed such a conserved amino acid dyad upstream of the putative NTPase domain. In the TYMV sequence, these amino acids, Cys783 and His869, were located within the 688-amino acid region which is reported to be essential for autocleavage [15] . The conserved Cys is followed by Leu (or Met in the case of ELV); this is in contrast to other papain-like proteinases, which have an aromatic amino acid at this position ( Figs. 2A, B) , with one exception, the Staphylococcal proteinase. Similar to most other papain-like proteinases, both the Cys and His residues are preceded by regions rich in structure breakers, such as Pro, Gly, Asn, Set, although the conserved amino acid pattern is unique for the tymovirus sequences (Figs 2A, B) Using the level of similarity between tymovirus sequences as the main criterion, and by analogy with known papain-like proteinases, the N-terminal border of the TYMV proteinase domain was predicted to be not further than 49 amino acid residues upstream of the essential Cys783. The C-terminal border of the proteinase could be located in a fairly short variable stretch of the sequence, between His869 and the putative NTPase/helicase domain. As the borders of the latter were not determined, \"motif\" A [19] , GFAGCGKT, where K is the invariant Lys982, had to be considered its N-terminal border.",

Site-directed point mutations were introduced into a TYMV cDNA clone, pTYFL7. Their influence on autoproteolysis of RP was then investigated by in vitro translation of corresponding mutant transcripts using both standard (Fig. 3A) and temperature shift conditions [13] (data not shown) for each of them. In full agreement with our predictions, replacement of Cys783 by Ser (C783S) or of His869 by Glu (H869E) abolished RP to NRP and CRP hydrolysis (Fig. 3A, lanes 3, 4) . Other substitutions such as replacement of the invariant Ser925 for Leu ($925L; lane To localize the proteinase domain in a short stretch of sequence containing the essential Cys and His, two deletion variants of pTYFL7 were constructed, pdNN* and pdS*A. To delete the 5-proximal half of the RP gene, a single point mutation T2217 to C was introduced into the TYMV cDNA upstream of, and close to, the predicted 5'-border of the proteinase gene so as to create a second NcoI site referred to as NcoI*. The transcripts obtained from the NcoI-NcoI* deletion variant of the TYMV cDNA (Fig. 1) gave rise upon translation in reticulocyte lysates to a truncated polypeptide (dNN*) of 131 K, which underwent autoproteolysis yielding the NRP product and the unaltered CRP product (Fig. 3B, lanes 7-9) under conditions identical to those observed with a full-length transcript (wt; Fig. 3A , lane 2) or with TYMV RNA (Fig. 3B,  lanes 1-3) . Thus, the deleted amino acid sequences are not required for autoproteotysis of the polyprotein in vitro. In addition, the fact that the two transcripts tdNN* and tdNN*s, which differ in the first 39 codons upstream of the NcoI site, gave identical results (not shown), eliminated the possibility that the N-terminus of RP participates in autoproteolysis. Hence, in agreement with our prediction, the N-terminal border of the proteinase is downstream from amino acid 709 in the polyprotein.",

To determine whether other Sindbis-like plant viruses have (putative) TYMV-like proteinase domains, we examined their polypeptides for the presence of the tymo-like proteinase sequence motifs (in the case of BNYVV it was kindly done by E. V. Koonin and V. V. Dolja, pers. comm. and [43] ). Stretches of sequences which contained such motifs were analyzed for overall similarity to the tymovirus proteinase. Figures 2B, C show the results of our analysis. Of the five sequences that were significantly similar to the TYMV proteinase, four (PVM, ASPV, ASGV, and ACLSV) were aligned with each other (Fig. 2C ) and then compared with the alignment of the 5 tymoviral proteinase sequences. The resulting alignment score of 6.5 SD supports our hypothesis on the relationship of these sequences of the carlavirus PVM, and the capillovirus ASGV as well as of ASPV and ACLSV, to those of tymoviral proteinases. The best score for the putative BNYVV proteinase (6.7SD) was obtained when its sequence was compared with the alignment of all the TYMV-like proteinase sequences. Such a score, although the worst one of the respective scores obtained for any of 9 other sequences, reflects a probable relationship.",

Taking into account that, as mentioned above, there are no other obvious candidates for the role of catalytically active amino acids in the central region of the tymovirus polyproteins, it is likely that Cys783 and His869 play this role in the TYMV proteinase. Inhibition studies of TYMV RP autocleavage also favor our conclusions. Inhibitors of thiol proteinases such as ZnC12 abolish autoproteolysis of RP even at low concentrations, while inhibitors of serine proteinases affect proteolysis only at high concentration [13] . Failure of cystatin and E64 to influence hydrolysis of the RP [13] does not contradict our hypothesis, because not all genuine papain-like proteinases are sensitive to these inhibitors [44] . The question of whether the TYMV proteinase resembles papain in its 3D structure or at least in the configuration of its active site will be resolved only when X-ray data will become available. Figure 3C demonstrates that under our conditions the proteinase does not cleave the mutant polyprotein in trans, but acts in cis in agreement with previously reported data [ 13, 15] . Indeed, with the exception of the proteinases of alphaviruses [31] , most viral papain-like proteinases apparently function only in cis.",

This site has been tentatively located by site-directed mutagenesis within a 9 amino acid stretch, between amino acids 1253 and 1261 [15] , at the border of the NTPase and polymerase domains. Alignment of five tymovirus sequences shows that this region of the tymoviral polyprotein is not highly conserved. But it does contain only small amino acid residues, Gly, Ala or Ser, in positions which correspond to amino acids 1258 and 1259 of the RP polyprotein of TYMV (M.N.R. unpubl.). Notably, a Gly residue is present in one of the corresponding positions in each sequence. Cleavage of the tymovirus polyproteins may take place at this site by analogy with those of other viral papain-like proteinases known to hydrolyze the peptide bond between two small amino acid residues (alphaviruses -nsP1/nsP2 and nsP2/nsP3 sites [45] , potyviruses [46] , HyAV [37, 38] , artheriviruses [35] ), or when at least P1 position (i.e. the position to the left of the scissile bond) is occupied by Gly or Ala (alphaviruses -nsP3/nsP4 site [451, coronaviruses-p28 site [47, 48] ). Similar potential cleavage/recognition sites are found at corresponding positions in polyproteins of other viruses containing the TYMV-like proteinase domain (M.N.R., unpubl.).",

            "text": "Computer-assisted sequence analysis predicts that proteinase domains related to that of TYMV are encoded upstream from the putative NTPase gene of tymoviruses, carlaviruses, capilloviruses, ASPV and ACLSV. We suggest to name the new group the TYMO-LIKE PROTEINASE GROUP, since TYMV putative NTPase/ helicase; pol (putative) polymerase; P or P papain-tike proteinase predicted/characterized previously or in this study, respectively; r/t read-through; nsPl, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4 are the alphavirus non-structural proteins; diamonds: stop codons; arrows: cleavage sites; SBWMV soilborne wheat mosaic furovirus is the prototype of this new group. In addition to the invariant papain-like Cys-His dyad, the tymo-like proteinases contain a third highly conserved amino acid residue, Gly (Gly821 in TYMV RP), followed by a hydrophobic residue. This motif is apparently missing from other papain-like proteinases and is thus an additional hallmark of this group. After the Cys-and His-containing motifs, the conserved Gly seems to be the third interesting target for mutagenesis experiments. The putative proteinase of BNYVV does not conserve the Gly residue, although it resembles the tymo-like proteinases at a statistically significant level. This is not surprising considering different location of this domain (between the putative NTPase and polymerase domains, Fig. 4 ) in the potyprotein and the fact that other BNYVV replicative proteins are not closely related to those of any plant RNA virus [11, 16] . Our attempts to produce significant sequence alignments between tymo-like and other proteinases were unsuccessful. We conclude that tymo-like proteinases constitute a distinct group (Fig. 2) within the majority of viral papain-like enzymes [4] , and speculate that the members of this group may share biochemical and biological features. Taking into account the indispensability of the essential papain-like Cys-His dyad for replication of TYMV [50] , (K. Sdron, G. Kadar6 [52] , it is tempting to speculate that all tymo-like proteinases cleave the large viral polyproteins yielding a functional \"methyltransferase-helicase\" block [11, 53] as an N-terminal product and an RNA polymerase domain as a C-terminal product. Notably, the alphavirus counterparts of the TYMV cleavage products, P123 and P34 are essential to form the viral replicative complex [54] . The other six groups of Sindbis-viruses shown on Fig. 4 do not seem to utilize the strategy of proteolysis of their proteins. Nevertheless 5 of them, i.e. tobamo-, tobra-, furo (SBWMV), tricorna-and hordeiviruses, do produce the \"methyltransferase-helicase\" block as a separate protein, but use two different mechanisms [5] . Thus, the strategy of processing of the large nonstructural viral polyprotein by the papain-like domain seems to be one of several possible solutions to the problem of organizing and regulating production of the viral replicase complex.",

A Alignment of the sequence segments around the conserved (catalytic) Cys and His of viral and selected cellular papain-like proteinases. The motifs were aligned manually following previously published alignments L4,35,38]. M-pro, main proteinase, L-pro, leader proteinase according to[4]. SSP Streptococcus pneumonia proteinase, SNBV Sindbis virus, RUBV rubella virus (a rubivirus), EAV equine arteris virus (an arterivirus), MHV mouse hepatitis coronavirus, TEV tobacco etch potyvirus. Numbers indicate distances between the motifs. B Sequence alignment of the (putative) proteinases of tymoviruses. The alignment made use of the program OPTAL[19] as follows. Alignment of 5 tymovirus sequences was produced by adding to the sequence of the TYMV proteinase those of KYMV, EMV, OYMV, and ELM stepwise. The respective alignment scores were 17.5, 17.6, 18.5 and t 4.6 SD.Consensus 1 Consensus pattern for tymovirus proteinases. Positions occupied by bulky hydrophobic residues (I, L, V, M, F, Y or W) in at least 4 sequences are indicated by asterisks. Positions of the sequences in viral polyproteins are shown left. C Alignment of the sequences of putative proteinases of carlaviruses, capilloviruses, ASPV, ACLSV and of BNYVV. The sequence fi'agment of PVM was aligned with that of ASPV and the sequences of ASGV and ACLSV were subsequently added. The scores were 15.6, 6.4 and 7.0 SD, respectively. For further explanations see text. Consensus 2 is derived using the same rules as Experimental testing of the predicted papain-like proteinase domain of RP of TYMV. A Mutation analysis of the TYMV proteinase domain. SDS-PAGE analysis of the in vitro translation products programmed by TYMV RNA (I), wt TYFL7 (2) or the mutated transcripts C783S (3), H869E (4), $925L (5), K982S (6). In this experiment L-[3SS]methionine was used instead of [35S]cysteine. The final concentration of all templates was 10 gg/ml. Incubations were performed at 30 \u00b0C. The positions of RP and of its cleavage products, NRP and CRP, as well as of OP, are indicated to the left. B Determining the borders of the proteinase domain. SDS-PAGE analysis of the in vitro translation products programmed by TYMV RNA or the deletion transcripts dS*A and dNN*. The final template concentration was 50 gg/ml for TYMV RNA or for dNN*, and 200 gg/ml for dS*A. Incubations were initiated at 37 \u00b0C, and after 30 min an aliquot was removed for analysis(I, 4, 7). To the remainder, puromycin was added without ( -) or with (+) N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and incubation was continued for another 10min at 37\u00b0C before shifting to 30 \u00b0C(2,3,5,6,8,9) and incubating for 50 min at that temperature. Samples (8 gl) were analyzed in each case. The positions of RP(1-3), and of NRP (2) and CRP(2,5,8) are indicated to the left. To the right are provided the positions of dS*A-RP (4-6), dNN*-RP(7)(8)(9), dS*A-NRP (5), and of dNN*-NRP(8). M corresponds to 14C-labelled protein markers (Amersham) of 200 K, 97.4 K, 69 K, 46 K and 30 K. C SDS-PAGE analysis of the in vitro translation products programmed by transcript C783S in the absence of presence of the transcript produced from TYFL1. The latter construct linearized from pTYFL1 by SacI corresponds to nucleotides 1 to 3283 of the TYMV genome[29] and codes for a polyprotein of 117 K that is terminated upstream of the putative cleavage/ recognition site. The final template concentration was 50gg/ml for TYMV RNA (I), 200 gg/ml for tC783S(2,3) and 100 gg/ml for tTYFL1(3,4), incubation was for 60 rain at 30 \u00b0C. In 3 the molar ratio of C783S over TYFL1 is approximately 1 to 1. The positions of the major products are indicated to the right. All wells are from the same gel 5), or of the invariant Lys982 (located in the NTPase motif, GXXXXGKT) for Set (K982S; lane 6) had no influence on proteolysis.",
