CT is an established procedure to control infectious disease transmission and it is gaining importance in the International Health Regulations [3] . The decision to initiate CT usually needs to be made on short notice to be effective and typically within a context of provisional and limited information. This results in a need for decision aids that would provide standardization and, at the same time, allow flexibility in the decision process given the diverse circumstances in which the risk of infectious disease spread has to be assessed.",

The following epidemiological criteria were identified not to be relevant for tuberculosis or meningococcal disease: \"high infectiousness\", \"high morbidity rate\", \"severe complications\", \"vaccination status of contact person\", \"high humidity\", \"pregnancy of contact person\", \"contact person > 60 years\", \"contact person < 1 year\", \"high seriousness as perceived by public\". Our report describes the methodological concept of an evidence-based decision making tool and presents CT-RAP examples on tuberculosis and on meningococcal disease. This new approach aims to semi-quantitatively translate evidence of variable strength and on diverse conditions into a graphical risk assessment tool. We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well established in the social sciences to display different characteristics which in its sum will give a pictorial and semi-quantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based on biological and epidemiological criteria the challenge is similar since the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision but allows to weigh in other factors. It is rather a combination of conditions which characterizes a specific situation that may lead the decision towards a certain direction. A numerical computation of individual scores could also cope with the combination of different criteria, but tends to suggest a precision the available evidence does not support. Thus the visual impression resulting from the connecting lines between the ticked values of the epidemiological criteria is likely to give enough of a tendency to quickly support decision making while leaving enough room for the decision makers to take other important issues into account. In addition the disease specific epidemiological criteria of the CT-RAP can, in combination with the fact sheet, be employed as a checklist of decisive parameters.",

If passenger data are indeed collected, incompleteness of data, transport company policies and limited or delayed (retrospective) access to data may be further obstacles. Even in long-distance railway or bus transportation, passenger data may also not be collected routinely [4, 24] . Taking into account the logistic bottle necks and the high financial resources CT may require, we suppose that only circumstances related to dramatic illness and identifiable travel groups would justify contact investigations in the setting of public ground transport. We complemented the available scientific evidence generated through the literature review by structured multi-step expert consultations. While individual experts might not appreciate all epidemiological criteria equally well or weigh their effects differently, all criteria selections with their respective values on our CT-RAPs are the result a Delphi consultation process. We are aware that information such as \"susceptibility of contact persons\", \"quality of contact between index case and contact person\", or other information may not be available in each setting. Nevertheless the CT-RAP may be used under such circumstances: if there is no information available on a criterion, the neutral midline position on the scale of the respective epidemiological criterion has to be chosen and the indication remains unaffected.",

We present the results in exemplary risk assessment profiles for deciding 26 whether or not contact tracing may be indicated after passengers have been exposed to 27 Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Neisseria meningitidis in public ground transport. To provide scientific and technical input, four core experts from diverse settings were nominated to 5 cover a wide range of perspectives: one infectious disease epidemiologist working for an international 6 public health agency, one infectious disease epidemiologist working for a national public health 7 institute, one infectious disease epidemiologist working for a local public health institute, and one 8 expert in security/health issues working for an international public transport association. Those core 9 experts participated in two structured round table consultations. We also consulted epidemiologists 10 from the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) with disease specific expertise. In addition 18 international 11 infectious disease epidemiologists affiliated with the REACT project contributed their expertise to a 12 Delphi consultation process.",

The following 2 epidemiological criteria were identified not to be relevant for tuberculosis or meningococcal disease: 3 \"high infectiousness\", \"high morbidity rate\", \"severe complications\", \"vaccination status of contact 4 person\", \"high humidity\", \"pregnancy of contact person\", \"contact person > 60 years\", \"contact person 5 < 1 year\", \"high seriousness as perceived by public\". specific situation that may lead the decision towards a certain direction. A numerical computation of 1 individual scores could also cope with the combination of different criteria, but tends to suggest a 2 precision not supported by the available evidence. Thus the visual impression resulting from the 3 connecting lines between the ticked values of the epidemiological criteria is likely to give enough of a 4 tendency to quickly support decision making while leaving enough room for the decision makers to 5 take other important issues into account. In addition the disease specific epidemiological criteria of the 6 CT-RAP can, in combination with the fact sheet, be employed as a checklist of decisive parameters.",

Six of the criteria (\"therapy or targeted 7 measures available\", \"airborne transmission\", \"communicability during symptoms\", \"high grade 8 immune-deficiency or immuno-suppression of contact person\", \"travel duration > 8 hours\", \"distance to 9 index case < 1 meter\") were identified to be relevant and applicable for both tuberculosis and 10 meningococcal disease, two epidemiological criteria applied only to meningococcal disease 11 (\"prophylaxis available\", \"communicability before onset of symptoms\") and \"drug resistance pattern\" 12 was added for tuberculosis as a result of the expert consultation in step two. The following 13 epidemiological criteria were identified not to be relevant for tuberculosis or meningococcal disease: 14 \"high infectiousness\", \"high morbidity rate\", \"severe complications\", \"vaccination status of contact 15 person\", \"high humidity\", \"pregnancy of contact person\", \"contact person > 60 years\", \"contact person 16 < 1 year\", \"high seriousness as perceived by public\". 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Our report describes the methodological concept of a decision making tool and presents CT-RAP 5 examples on tuberculosis and on meningococcal disease. This new approach aims to semi-6 quantitatively translate evidence of variable strength and on diverse conditions into a graphical risk 7 assessment tool. We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well 8 established in the social sciences to display different characteristics which in its sum will give a 9 pictorial and semi-quantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based 10 on biological and epidemiological criteria the challenge is similar to that used in social sciences since 11 the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision 12 but allows to weigh in other factors. It is rather a combination of conditions which characterizes a 13 specific situation that may lead the decision towards a certain direction. A numerical computation of 14 individual scores could also cope with the combination of different criteria, but tends to suggest a 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 suggesting specific weights or assigning priorities to each criterion. E.g. antimicrobial resistance may 1 be a more important issue to take into account in some country than others. The nomination procedure 2 for the expert panel was based on the rather strong objective and guiding principle to represent 3 different EU countries and various stakeholders, a prerequisite for successful funding within the EU 4 public health programme.",

The decision to initiate contact tracing usually 35 needs to be made on short notice to be effective and typically within a context of provisional and 36 limited information. This results in a need for decision aids that would provide standardization and, at 37 Travelling in public transport, often in confined spaces, provides risks for exposure to infectious 7 pathogens. It seems likely that the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission in public ground 8 transport such as bus/coach, railway, and tram/metro is higher than in air transport [4] . While 9 guidelines on contact tracing after exposure to airborne infectious pathogens during air travel exist[5-10 7], no guidance documents are available on contact tracing in response to potential exposure on 11 public ground transport, even though European transport statistics show that the share of total 12 transport performance in 2007 in public ground transport was nearly twice as high (15.7%) as the 13 share for air transport performance (8.8%) [8, 9] . 14 15 By studying the literature on these issues, we found two dominating formats for recommendations on 16 contact tracing: the first is a descriptive text or a list of variable length and precision [10] [11] [12] [13] . The other 17 frequently used format is a flow chart which presents certain conditions in successive order thus 18 resulting in each condition contributing an equal weight to the final decision [6, 12, [14] [15] [16] .

We present the results in exemplary risk assessment profiles for deciding 26 whether or not contact tracing may be indicated after passengers have been exposed to 27 Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Neisseria meningitidis in public ground transport. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 To provide scientific and technical input, four core experts from a pool of 30 international collaborating 7 project partners (such as European National Public Health Institutes, the World Health Organisation 8 (WHO), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)) were nominated at the 9 1 st General Meeting of the REACT project. Those four core experts provide the project with expertise 10 from diverse settings. As required by the donor they represent different EU countries and various 11 stakeholders. The core experts cover a wide range of perspectives: one infectious disease 12 epidemiologist working for an international public health agency, one infectious disease epidemiologist 13 working for a national public health institute, one infectious disease epidemiologist working for a local 14 public health institute, and one expert in security/health issues working for an international public 15 transport association. Those core experts participated in two structured round The international expert group identified tuberculosis and meningococcal disease as the two infectious 1 diseases with the highest priority for the development of a disease specific risk assessment tool.",

We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well 11 established in the social sciences to display different characteristics which in its sum will give a 12 pictorial and semi-quantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based 13 on biological and epidemiological criteria the challenge is similar to that used in social sciences since 14 the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision 15 but allows to weigh in other factors. It is rather a combination of conditions which characterizes a 16 specific situation that may lead the decision towards a certain direction.

This new approach aims to semi-32quantitatively translate evidence of variable strength and on diverse conditions into a graphical risk 33 assessment tool. We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well 34 established in the social sciences to display different characteristics which in its sum will give a 35 pictorial and semi-quantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based 36 on biological and epidemiological criteria the challenge is similar to that used in social sciences since 37 the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision 38 but allows to weigh in other factors.

While individual experts might not appreciate all 18 epidemiological criteria equally well or weigh their effects differently, all criteria selections with their 19 respective values on our CT-RAPs are the result a Delphi consultation process. We are aware that 20 information such as \"susceptibility of contact persons\", \"quality of contact between index case and 21 contact person\", or other information may not be available in each setting. Nevertheless the CT-RAP 22 may be used under such circumstances: if there is no information available on a criterion, the neutral 23 midline position on the scale of the respective epidemiological criterion has to be chosen and the 24 indication remains unaffected. 25 The two CT-RAP examples on tuberculosis and meningococcal disease shown in Figure 3 and 4 26 illustrate how this new tool offers a highly standardized decision algorithm where evidence allows, but 27 also remains open for consideration of other factors. For example a public health official might 28 consider a contact investigation in the tuberculosis scenario dependent upon the drug resistance 29 pattern of the index case. Likewise, in the meningococcal disease scenario a contact tracing might 30 only yield results the following day at the earliest.

Only if the index case is known to have infectious pulmonary tuberculosis, the 13 user can proceed with the bipolar scale component which consists of nine epidemiological criteria. For 14 each epidemiological criterion, a single, mutually exclusive value has to be selected. All values are 15 pre-positioned on bipolar scales (Figure 1). The background information for the CT-RAP for 16 tuberculosis consists of a summary of relevant scientific literature of 58 peer reviewed publications in 17 international journals and 20 guidance documents including recommendations and position papers. 18 For meningococcal disease the dichotomous decision step preceding the bipolar scale component of 19 the CT-RAP addresses the time span elapsed since exposure. Only if this time span is equal or less 20 than ten days the user continues with the bipolar scale component displaying seven epidemiological 21 criteria with each two to four different values (Figure 2). The background information of the CT-RAP for 22 meningococcal disease consists of a summary of the scientific literature of 17 peer reviewed 23 publications in international journals and 17 guidance documents (including recommendations and 24 position papers).

We intentionally derived our approach from an assessment tool that is well 34 established in the social sciences to display different characteristics which in its sum will give a 35 pictorial and semi-quantitative impression through an overall profile. Although our application is based 36 on biological and epidemiological criteria the challenge is similar to that used in social sciences since 37 the outcome of one measurement alone will not force, like in many dichotomous structures, a decision 38 but allows to weigh in other factors.

An attempt to give a semi-quantitative10 account of the degree of uncertainty, e.g. by plotting confidence intervals and means for each point 11 estimate representing the experts' opinions, is of course subject for discussion. Indicating medians as 12 well as minimum and maximum point estimates would be an alternative approach. Both approaches 13 have their advantages. Even the objective to give a semi-quantitative account of the degree of 14 uncertainty might be questioned. But we preferred to show the degree of uncertainty inherent in each 15 decisive criterion by displaying the range of values through whiskers (median of the highest and lowest 16 ranking of aggregated expert\u00b4s opinions). Considering that some criteria have a lesser degree of 17 uncertainty than others and that some users might not consider the degree of uncertainty at all, we 18 believe our approach is more suitable. 19 20 It could be argued that criteria should be removed from the decision making tool if the point estimates 21 of the different outcomes cluster closely around the neutral midline and thus do not sway a decision 22 either way, however all criteria were included in the first instance because they have been raised in 23 various publications or during expert consultations.

In addition 18 international infectious disease epidemiologists from the pool of 18 collaborating partners affiliated with the REACT project, as well nominated at the 1 st General Meeting, 19 contributed their expertise to a Delphi consultation process in two rounds. At the first round table consultation, we turned to the four core experts to gather information enabling 23 us to select infectious diseases that require contact tracing in public ground transport and to reach a 24 consensus on the general epidemiological and environmental criteria that might influence the 25 transmission of infectious diseases and the subsequent decision making process. Where necessary, the general criteria identified in step one were transformed into disease specific 29 criteria. Subsequently, we defined between two and four values with respect to the epidemiological 30 criterion, e.g. for the tuberculosis specific epidemiological criterion \"transmission to other contact 31 persons\" we defined the two values \"evidence of transmission\" and \"no evidence of transmission\". The 32 definition of those epidemiological criteria related values was deducted from the scientific literature 33 with input from RKI infectious disease experts.
