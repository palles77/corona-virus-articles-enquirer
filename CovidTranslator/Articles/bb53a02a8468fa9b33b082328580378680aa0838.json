We propose a Cybernetics-based Dynamic Infection Model (CDIM) to the dynamic infection process with a probability distributed incubation delay and feedback principle. Reproductive trends and the stability of the SARS-COV-2 infection in a city can then be analyzed, and the uncontrollable risks can be forecasted before they really happen. The infection mechanism of a city is depicted using the philosophy of cybernetics and approaches of the control engineering. Distinguished with other epidemiological models, such as SIR, SEIR, etc., that compute the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population, CDIM considers the immigration and emigration population as system inputs, and administrative and medical resources as dynamic control variables. The epidemic regulation can be simulated in the model to support the decision-making for containing the outbreak. City case studies are demonstrated for verification and validation.",

During the currently still happening disaster, people and governments have gradually enhanced the strength of responses. Three Chinese cities (Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou) were shut down on Jan 23, 2020 to contain the rapidly-spreading virus; In most of Chinese cities, The first-level public health emergency response was activated on Jan 24, 2020; Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals were built in less than two weeks to admit and treat patients at the epicenter of the virus; After Feb 2, 2020, Wuhan start to convert gymnasiums and exhibition centers into temporary shelter(fangcang) hospitals to accept and quarantine patients with mild symptoms. Tens of thousands of doctors and nurses from all over China have been sent to Wuhan. It seams we have always been pushed into a defensive position, that the responses were always later than the developing epidemic status. As a spontaneously summoned team, we have continuously followed the progress of this epidemic, and believe that we have found a novel forecast model to solve this problem. Base on this model, corresponding responses could be activated before the uncontrollable risks really happen.",

However, the control engineering has seldom been used in modeling the transmission pattern of the epidemic. Comparing its basic mechanism with an instable system, we found the dynamic infection process of COVID-19 in a city could be depicted as a cybernetic model with a positive feedback and multiple delays, and the system instability is the most issue that people and the government concern. In contrast to other classic transmission models like SIR/-SEIR (the susceptible, [exposed] , infectious and recovered model), which are mostly described by a set of ordinary differential equations [2] , the feedback system is constituted by a chain of discrete function blocks, such as proportional, time delayed, integral(or accumulative) blocks, and positive/negative feedback or feed-forward loop, etc. Dynamic manipulations, such as quarantining activities, medical supplies, etc., are also considered in the model. In those consideration, the model is named as Cybernetics-based Dynamic Infection Model (CDIM).",

In the responsive condition, when a patient is confirmed, certain close contacts that are still in the asymptomatic incubation period would also be isolated. We introduce C 1 , named the contact tracing rate, to reflect this effect. When C 1 \u2248 0, that means no contact tracing is imposed, the system could easily fall into an instable state if R 0 \u2265 1.0. The infection model is discretized with a cyclic period of one day.

It brings troubles in estimating the epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions [4, 5] . Most estimated R 0 ranges from 1.5 to 4.0 [1, 6, 7, 8] . As of Jan 29, 2020, the first investigated incubation period from patients was reported, which had a mean of 5.2 days(95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0) and followed a Poisson distribution, and the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9) [6] . However, the early sampled 425 patients had a median age of 59 years and 56% were male. Given those bias on the samples, the estimated epidemiological parameters may have deviations that might lead to great errors in the simulation. In the view of this, we used the data from Shanghai, a relatively well controlled city, to identify and calibrate the key parameters of the incubation period and the basic reproductive number. Subsequently, those parameters were used to evaluate the status of other cities (except for those cities in Hubei province). In Shanghai Model, there is no worry about the shortage of medical supplies, so a negative summation channel performs a direct control effect on the positive feedback infection loop, which is thus of paramount importance in reducing the number of total infectious cases. Two factors in the system can be regulated by the administration, C 0 and C 1 . The confirmation delay does not affect the infecting process, but brings a direct hinder in inspecting the real number of confirmed cases. The input of the Shanghai Model mainly comes from the inspected cases from Wuhan, so the number of daily imported cases should be given by R 1 x 1 , where R 1 is the infection rate of immigration, and x 1 is the daily immigrated population from Wuhan. On Jan 23, 2020, Wuhan went into lockdown to contain the outbreak of the epidemic. Since then, the input from immigration was switched off. Those sudden events changed the system dynamics dramatically, and is difficult to be estimated or approximated by other transmission models. Other similar cities can reuse the Shanghai Model with some modification on the parameters C 0 and C 1 . Nonetheless, the 4 .

Based on the collected bed data from designated, makeshift, Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals, the model simulated the real situation. What can be confirmed was that emergent quarantining actions should be more strictly taken to admit the infected patients, and much more hospital beds should be prepared to contain the outbreak in Wuhan. Fig. 11 shows the simulated results. We estimated the number of infection based on the confirmed cases from the Japanese and German evacuation. There were 1.4% confirmed cases in the total evacuated population. Fig. 11(a) shows the risk of instability, and Fig. 11(b) gives the result when the forced isolation (namely the subsequent fancang hospitals) was activated since Feb 02, 2020 to curb the spread of the virus. Some days later, the forced isolation in Wuhan was implemented by those temporary shelter hospitals or fangcang. Due to the lack of data, there might exist significant errors in the simulated results. In spite of that, the epidemic stability in Wuhan was successfully estimated, and the model proves that the fancang hospitals played a vitally important role in containing the outbreak at last. The simulation of Wuhan implies a fact that, stability oriented analysis is far more important than accuracy oriented analysis. In order to make a quick decision, administrative responses could activated according to the forecasted risk of instability rather than the forecasted infected numbers. This is because the estimation of stability is usually much faster than the estimation of accuracy. ",

Two polymorphic models for different city types are derived with considerations on their medical, immigration/emigration population and administrative conditions. Shanghai, Beijing, Wenzhou and Wuhan were studied to validate the infection models. More simulated results based on the successive data from 37 cities in China are listed in the appendix. Results demonstrate that the model can successfully simulate the dynamic infecting process of COVID-19, and uncontrollable risks in a city can be predicted before they come true. Additionally, administrative management can be verified by the model so that decisions can be made in time with more confidence according to the forecasts and warnings. Combined with big data of the intercity traffics, the research work is even more help-ful to future epidemic predictions. Uncontrollable risks in multiple cities could be monitored in parallel, emergency responses could be activated faster, and medical supplies would be produced precisely and transported to the right place at the right time.",

Most of cities fit well with the estimation, though some cities have some deviations. This is mainly caused by the dynamic quarantining level that changes R 0 . It implies that, in order to better estimate the epidemic, a dynamic parameter identification algorithm should be developed in future work. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
