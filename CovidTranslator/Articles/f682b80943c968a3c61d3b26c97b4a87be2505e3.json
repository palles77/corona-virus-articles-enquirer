            "text": "Molecular studies of insect disease vectors such as Bemisia tabaci are of increasing importance for understanding pathogen-vector relationships. Discovering the relevant genes that contribute to viral translocation through insect organs will facilitate the development of novel strategies for interfering with vector transmission of plant viruses. The ultimate goal of this study is silencing of putative transmission-responsible genes in the future by the development of transgenics. Information on gene expression and control in the target insect is necessary for this goal. Among the most important plant viruses to be transmitted by B. tabaci are those in the genus Begomovirus (family, Geminiviridae). Unfortunately, little is known about the genome of this vector. This study is investigating molecular aspects of the interaction between Whitefly B. tabaci and begomoviruses. As an initial step in this project differential display reverse transcriptase-PCR and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR has been applied to characterize differentially expressed mRNA from viruliferous and non-viruliferous insects, and in one case, from a B. tabaci feeding on TYLCV infected plants. Among 120 EST have been sequenced, twenty-seven ESTs show homology to known sequences from GenBank. Of these, fifteen ESTs code for up-regulated genes such as NADP-dependent D-sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Aldoketoreductase family), cell wall associated hydrolase, cytochrome oxidase P450 of B. tabaci, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4-like gene, alpha satellite repeat, maf Ham1 superfamily, periplasmic-binding proteins, cation-binding domain, odorant-binding protein. There are differentially expressed downregulated genes such as ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase/protease ubiquitin specific protease [Culex quinquefasciatus], ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, Apis mellifera, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2-like (and in most insects like Apis millifera aphids, and Anopheles gambiae, saccharopine reductase, sugar (Glycoside-Pentoside-Hexuronide) transporter, aminophospholipid transporter, B. tabaci vitellogienin gene. Expression patterns were verified using qRT-PCR and revealed the accuracy of ESTs in cases of up-and down-regulation. monkeys on St. Kitts is considered to be almost equal to that of humans (around 40,000) . The majority of the monkeys are wild. Some juvenile monkeys are caught by locals, and are caged and/or used for entertaining tourists (tourism animals). Several hundreds of monkeys are kept at two of the island's primate research centers. The present project was designed to study the prevalence of simian rotaviruses and noroviruses in three different green vervet monkey populations on St. Kitts. A total of 143 fecal samples were collected from three different monkey populations (wild, captive and tourism animals). Viral RNA was extracted from the simian fecal samples by the SDS-phenolchloroform extraction method. The presence of rotavirus and picobirnaviruses (PBV) was detected using RNA electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels (RNA-PAGE). Subsequently, the RNA migration patterns were visualized in polyacrylamide gels by silver staining. RNA-PAGE revealed double-band migration patterns indicative of picobirnaviruses in at least four of screened fecal samples. Picobirnaviruses are small non-enveloped bi-segmented doublestranded RNA viruses that have been reported in humans and a wide range of animal species, including a single report from monkeys in China. A few studies have provided evidence which suggest that PBVs are zoonotic. In most cases, including this work, these viruses were detected by accident while screening fecal samples for rotaviruses by RNA-PAGE. The presence of rotaviruses and/or picobirnaviruses in the fecal samples will be further confirmed by RT-PCR technique. As the enteric RNA-virome of the gastrointestinal tract of African green vervet monkeys of St Kitts remains uncharacterized, the genome sequencing and sequence analysis will be performed on select virus strains to study the genetic diversity of rotaviruses and picobirnaviruses in this part of the world. In recent years, a number of flaviviruses that replicate only in arthropods have been discovered and characterized. Herein, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel mosquitoonly flavivirus. The novel flavivirus was isolated from C.",

Evidence for a flavivirus was detected by indirect immunofluorescent assay in cell culture supernatant of infected C6/36 cells using polyclonal flavivirus group antibodies and confirmed by RT-PCR. In pairwise comparison of the ENV region sequences, nucleotide (47.4%) and amino acid (39.8%) identity was observed with Nounan\u00e9 virus (NOUV). Pairwise comparison of the NS5 region, nucleotide identity was observed with Spondweni virus (65.9%), Iguape virus (IGUV; 65.7%) and Kedougou virus (65.6%); however, at the amino acid level, pairwise identity was observed with IGUV (69.8%), Naranjal virus (69.6%) and Bussuquara virus (69.3%). Phylogenetic analysis using partial ENV and NS5 amino acid sequences revealed it forms a clade with NOUV. To investigate the host range of the novel flavivirus, we inoculated a variety of mammalian cells (Vero 76, Vero E6, BHK, LLCMK and MDCK) with pools of third passage C6/36 isolates and monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE) . No CPE was detected, and all mammalian cells lines were negative for flavivirus antigen by IFA and flavivirus RNA by RT-PCR following 14 days of incubation. We propose that this genetically distinct flavivirus be named nanay virus, after the zone of Iquitos, Peru, where it was first detected. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) viruses are divided into two major genotypes (type 1 and type 2). Type 1 PRRSV is further divided into at least three subtypes, but until now only subtype 1 has been detected in Western Europe and North America. Both genotypes are circulating in Denmark and since vaccinations are widely used it is essential to monitor the diversity of circulating PRRSV to secure the vaccines are up-to-date. Prior to the present study, the diversity of circulating viruses in Denmark was virtually unknown. The main objective was to assess the diversity of circulating PRRS viruses in Danish pigs and to investigate the genetic drift of the virus in a closed population with very limited introductions of new animals. The study included phylogenetic analysis of full genome sequences of type 1 and type 2 PRRS viruses, including the very first Danish isolated type 1 virus and the very first Danish type 2 virus, which was isolated from a non-vaccinated pig herd. The results showed a very high genetic diversity among the Danish viruses throughout the genome within the same genotype. A global phylogenetic analysis showed that the Danish type 1 PRRSV formed two major clusters, one vaccine-like clade exclusively containing viruses isolated after the Porcilis vaccine was introduced and another distinct clade consisting mainly of viruses isolated in Denmark. Phylogenetic analysis in a global type 2 PRRSV framework classified all Danish type 2 viruses to a single cluster (sub-lineage 5.1) which comprised viruses closely related to the type 2 prototype isolate VR2332.",

The factors behind the emergence of these viruses are poorly understood, in part because of sparse sampling immediately after the identification of H5N1 in 1996. Since 2009 there has been a surge in novel reassortant HPAI H5 viruses, most notably H5N8 in 2013. The H5N8 virus epidemic provides an opportunity to investigate the factors behind HPAI emergence in much more detail than before. Our dataset consists of 110 H5 HA segment sequences sampled during H5N8 outbreaks from late 2013 to December 2014. Eightyfive of these samples were isolated from birds in twelve different provinces in the Republic of Korea, the second country to report outbreaks of H5N8. Forty-six of these are new unpublished isolates. The host species is known for almost all sequences. Ecological data (including domestic duck and chicken density and wintering waterfowl numbers) are available for all provinces. I hope to use phylogeographic and molecular clock methods to reconstruct the spread of H5N8. By integrating the spatial trajectory of the virus with existing ecological data, I will try to characterize the factors behind the spread of H5N8 in the Republic of Korea. The results of this study will help illuminate key drivers of the emergence of novel and historical HPAI in Asia, and their subsequent global spread. Currently there is limited information about the naturally occurring infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains that circulate in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T). Vaccination against the virus is widespread across the poultry sector; however, not much work has been done to identify the strains that exist in T&T. Poultry farmers who vaccinate their flock still experience clinical respiratory signs of disease on their farms and vaccines generally elicit poor cross-protection across serotypes. This research proposes to examine whether the occurrence of disease is due to novel strains, or other known strains of IBV, that differ from the traditionally used vaccination strains.",

However, the overall and comparative prevalence of HVP 2 in male and female baboons and the circulating strains of HVP2 from different regions in Kenya is not known. In this study, the prevalence of HVP2 in baboons was determined by detection of anti-HVP 2 antibodies in sera from 189 baboons captured from different regions, using ELISA. Molecular characterization of the ELISA positive samples was done by PCR with specific primers targeting the thymidine kinase region of the virus followed by sequencing. In total, 87% of the baboons had been exposed to HVP2 infection. About 90% of the female and 83% of the male baboons were seropositive for HVP2 antibodies. A PCR and sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis evaluation confirmed the presence of HVP 2 strain A951 as the circulating strain in seropositive baboons. This information on circulating strain of HVP2 will immensely enhance the use of baboons as models to study the pathogenesis of HSV and test vaccine strategies. To determine which species currently exist in Trinidad, insect light-trapping was performed in different ecozones throughout Trinidad.

Sera were tested for BTV and EHDV antibodies by ELISA to establish when the animals first seroconverted. Viral RNA was extracted from first-positive whole blood samples and subjected to group-specific reverse transcription quantitative realtime PCR (RT-qPCR) for both BTV and EHDV. Positive samples with the lowest Ct values were selected for virus isolation and serotypespecific RT-qPCRs to identify which of the twenty-four BTV serotypes and six EHDV serotypes are currently circulating in Trinidad. To date five BTV isolates have been obtained representing five different serotypes. Viral protein genes from the different BTV and EHDV isolates will be amplified and sequenced for subsequent phylogenetic analyses and viral evolution studies. In the era of improved biomedical interventions for prevention, the identification of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clusters using molecular epidemiology can inform public health efforts to interrupt ongoing HIV transmission. This retrospective study uses sequence and HIV drug-resistance data from individuals enrolled in clinical research studies at Georgetown University in Washington DC, which has 2.5% HIV prevalence. A total of 314 HIV pol gene sequences were collected from 1994 to 2013. Median age was 38 years, (71% female; 70% African American). HIV exposure was heterosexual sex for 35%, MSM for 15%, IDU for 17%, blood transfusion for 3% and unidentified or unknown for the remaining 30%. Transmitted drug resistance positions were removed and analyses performed using BEAST (GTR \u00fe I substitution model, gamma distributed rates, relaxed molecular clock and GMRF Bayesian skyline tree prior). 600,000,000 states were generated (MCMC method) to achieve an ESS > 200 after 10% burn-in. Results were verified using the maximal likelihood method. A total of nine transmission clusters with posterior probability >95% consisting of two to three individuals were identified using the GTR model implemented in BEAST. Additional analyses will include a larger data set including prospective enrollment patients, and be used to identify timing of the entry of the epidemic into the region, identify transmission 'hot spots' using geospatial data, and to investigate the relationship of the local epidemic with national and global transmissions. Additional skills acquired during the workshop will enhance our ability to address these relevant questions using this unique and rich historic and contemporary data set. Myeloablation and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) lead to significant depletion of circulating CD4 \u00fe T cells and could impact the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 reservoir. The analysis of the viral population before and after ASCT could help to address the origin of HIV blood reservoir after ASCT. We studied the longitudinal effect of combination chemotherapy and ASCT for HIV-related lymphoma on cellular HIV-1 DNA quantification and diversity in patients on antiretroviral therapy. We analyzed thirteen antiretroviral successfully treated-HIVinfected patients who received myeloablative chemotherapy and ASCT for relapsed or refractory lymphoma. HIV-DNA was quantified longitudinally using real-time PCR assay on whole blood samples at different time points before, during, and after ASCT. No significant difference in median HIV-DNA for each patient before and after ASCT was observed.",

Four time points were tested for each patient, two before and two after ASCT. Viral variants were reconstructed from UDPS sequences using a heuristic algorithm and viral dynamics were evaluated using nucleotide diversity. Sequences were evaluated for viral compartmentalization between viral population before and after ASCT. Analysis showed viral compartmentalization and an emergence of new viral quasispecies after ASCT in the patient who has been virological controlled by 7 years of antiretroviral treatment. This result suggested that virus found in blood after ASCT came from longlived ancient reservoirs, or a different compartment such as the gut. Analysis of additional patients with other compartment than blood and sorted cells in the graft is ongoing. Additional sequencing and prospective enrollment of participants is planned to build on the contemporary cohort to permit a timetrend analysis. Phylogenetic methods will be applied to analyze viral diversity and evolution and analyses performed to determine the long-term outcomes among those with TDR. genome coverage were obtained for thirteen HIV specimens. Phylogenetic and Simplot analysis identified pure subtypes D (n \u00bc 1), F1 (n \u00bc 1), H (n \u00bc 2) and CRF25 (n \u00bc 1). The remaining eight genomes were simple recombinants (n \u00bc 1; URF_JK) or complex recombinants of three or more subtypes, including A, C, F, G, H, J, K and unclassified (n \u00bc 7). The complexity of these URFs makes recombination analysis challenging. These complete genomes are a valuable contribution to surveillance of HIV strain diversity, which is important and essential to address the challenge posed by ongoing evolution of HIV and to monitor the rapidly changing HIV pandemic. Although the delay between the two epidemics may suggest two separate populations, we hypothesized that the transmission of HIV started in Cebu City and spread to Mandaue by people who shared needles in both cities. Phylogenetic analysis offers an important tool to test this hypothesis by assessing genetic similarities and differences within and between the two groups. We analyzed 111 HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences collected from people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men during surveillance in 2013.",

Sequences were aligned with HXB2 and a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was built using the GTR mode in FastTree. We found that ninety-six of the 111 sequences were subtype B grouped in a monophyletic clade. This is consistent with our hypothesis that the HIV infections among people who inject drugs in the two cities are clustered and that, despite the delay between the epidemics, the two epidemics are closely linked. Our objective was to study a recently initiated ($10 years) HIV epidemic in a native community that exhibits a restricted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) diversity, with the initial hypothesis that HIV would rapidly select escape mutations to the limited number of HLA alleles and this increased adaptation would impact HIV pathogenesis. We performed high-resolution HLA Class-I typing and near-full length HIV genome sequencing from sixty-five chronically infected HIV-positive individuals. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed by neighbor-joining and only bootstrap scores >90% were accepted. Implementing statistical and phylogenetic-based methods, we identified HLA-linked viral polymorphisms associated with escape from the most frequent HLA alleles. Considering them as signatures of viral adaptation, we correlated their presence with viral load and CD4 count. We identified twenty-four HLA-linked viral escape mutations (P < 0.05; q < 0.1) distributed across the entire HIV proteome. On the phylogenetic reconstruction, we observed highly supported (bootstrap support \u00bc 100%) monophyletic clades that suggest independent introductions of HIV. Classifying the viral variants based on their prevalence at the population-level, we found that viruses present at higher prevalence exhibited a higher number of escape mutations compared with those found at low prevalence (P \u00bc 0.0114). In a subset of forty-one antiretroviral-na\u00efve patients, we found that the number of escape mutations was positively correlated with CD4 count (P \u00bc 0.044) and negatively correlated with viral load (P \u00bc 0.023). The ability to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among the variants allowed us to show a rapid adaptation of HIV to the HLA-I mediated immune response that could be leading to less pathogenic infections.",

We have identified and characterized the transmitted/founder and longitudinal escape Envelope variants for ten subtype A and C HIV-1 infected individuals who developed varying levels of antibody breadth. Preliminary sequence analysis of the transmitted/founder Envelopes did not associate breadth with an amino acid signature, differences in gp120 variable loop length, or differences in the number of N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120. We did find evidence for early nAb pressure in three major regions of gp120 that are targeted by antibodies: the V1V2 hyper-variable domain, the CD4-binding site, and the N332-glycan patch, but with considerable overlap between the higher and lower neutralizers. Therefore, we postulate that analysis of the ensuing viral escape pathways, and the co-evolving B cell immunoglobulin variable domains, are key to understanding how early, strain-specific autologous antibodies broaden their specificities over time.",

Dengue is the most important vector transmitted disease in Costa Rica, but research on the local factors that affect the disease system is scarce. Recent studies show the presence of dengue virus (DENV) in wildlife, including bats, but the role they play in the transmission cycle is unknown. The significance of wildlife in (re)emerging infectious diseases has been increasingly appreciated, and it is possible that some species of bats are susceptible to DENV. This research aims to evaluate the presence of DENV in domiciliary bats that inhabit areas of high and low incidence of dengue, in wet and dry season, in Costa Rica to identify ecological, environmental, anthropogenic and virological factors that could involve the bat in a possible viral transmission cycle. We sampled houses in which humans and bats cohabit, took samples from bats and blood samples from humans, and collected mosquitoes by EVS-CO 2 traps. According to the sample type, we determined the presence (RT-PCR and virus isolation) and frequency (serology) of DENV in bats (blood and pool of organs), mosquitoes and humans to determine the possible virus circulation in them. We performed necropsy on a portion of the bats collected and histopathology on shock organs (heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, brain), to observe any possible sign of sickness. Furthermore, we will establish the phylogenetic relationships of the strains of DENV obtained from bats, together with co-circulating human and mosquito strains collected by the reference center, by analyzing the E region sequences. Characterizing intra-host genetic variability in dengue virus (DENV) virus is paramount for understanding its evolution and population dynamics in its current status as a major human pathogen. The extent to which viral diversity accrues in infected hosts influences aspects such as pathogenesis, transmission and host immunity. Although there are several studies of intra-host genetic diversity of dengue virus infection, limited data have been reported for DENV-4 so far. In the city of Guaruj a in the State of Sao Paulo, the reemergence and spread of this serotype was associated with its co-circulation and with the displacement of serotypes 1-3 during recent outbreaks. Based on this epidemiological framework, we seek to identify the intra-host genetic variation of DENV-4 strains from samples collected during the 2013 outbreak using deep sequencing technologies. We will estimate the level of variability and the evolutionary history of these viruses in response to selective pressures imposed by an urban population previously exposed to the remaining three dengue serotypes. This study would also be the first effort to investigate the intra-host diversity of DENV-4. , and a clear division of ECSA clade into three subgroups (I-III), were defined by Bayesian analysis; similar results were obtained using E1 gene sequences. A nucleotide identitybased approach is provided to facilitate CHIKV classification within the ECSA clade. Using seven methods to detect recombination, we found a statistically significant event (P-values range: 1.14 \u00c2 10 \u00c07 to 4.45 \u00c2 10 \u00c024 ) located within the nsP3 coding region. This finding was further confirmed by phylogenetic networks (PHI Test, P \u00bc 0.004) and phylogenetic tree incongruence analysis. The recombinant strain, KJ679578/India/2011 (ECSA III), derives from viruses of ECSA III and ECSA I. Our study demonstrates that recombination is an additional mechanism of genetic diversity in CHIKV that might assist in the cross-species transmission process.",

Bhatnagar, 1 Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a vector-borne disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes with a very high morbidity rate and its chronic state can persist for >2 years in some cases. Chikungunya is prevalent in most parts of India and has now become a global issue. We aimed to study the evolution of CHIKV in India, and for the same purpose more than 100 clinical field isolates were collected from across India over the span of 4 years (2010-13). All the clinical samples, along with CHIKV passaged six times in Vero cells in vitro, were subjected to clinical, molecular and next generation whole genome analysis. Activity of the virus was studied via viral load experiments, plaque assays, quantitative PCR and Sanger sequencing, before further processing for whole genome sequencing. The main purpose of this study was to perform in depth analysis of CHIKV genomes that could help to understand the underlying single nucleotide changes and mutation events that might have occurred within the CHIKV genome leading to its evolution. The genomic data and molecular analysis, along with SNPs and mutation information, were further correlated with clinical information in order to determine the evolution and molecular epidemiology of the virus. Enzootic strains that circulate in sylvatic, rodent-mosquito enzootic cycles regularly spillover to infect people and also emerge periodically to cause equine epizootics, characterized by an equid-mosquito amplification cycle that spills over to humans, causing major epidemics. Large human and equine epidemics since the 1920s have been associated with the epizootic strains IAB and IC; however, around 10% of the clinical diagnoses of dengue febrile cases in Latin America have been estimated to be VEEV ID or IE enzootic infections. Only enzootic VEEV ID and IE circulate in Panama, and the last VEEV Panamanian strains described were isolated in 2010 during a VEEV-EEEV outbreak in the sylvatic region close to Colombia. Differences in the geographic distribution of the VEEV complex and of epidemiologic profiles prompted evaluation of their evolutionary histories. In order to elucidate the pattern of transmission and dispersal of VEEV species through the Americas, we expanded the sequence length and the number of available VEEV strains, introducing more recent isolates, and analyzed them using basic phylogenetic tools. The models and training that will be gained during this course will allow us to reconstruct the phylodynamic and phylogeographic history of this complex through the years. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis and has significant implications for public health worldwide. To characterize HAV strains circulating in China, five samples collected in different provinces from 2006 to 2009 were entirely sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on distinct segments showed that all five sequences belonged to subgenotype IA, but with slight differences in some fragments. No amino acid mutations were found at the known neutralizing epitope sites, and one unique substitution was identified near the immunodominant site. While no intertypic recombination was detected, intratypic recombination signals were found in the study. Molecular evolution analyses showed the estimated mean substitution rate of genotype I worldwide was 3.27 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 substitutions/site/year, and the time to the most recent common ancestor was about 267 years ago. The quasispecies distribution across the complete genome was also evaluated and the nucleotide mutation frequency was found to range from 7.26 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 to 2.30 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 substitutions per nucleotide. The amino acid mutation frequency ranged from 1.38 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 to 4.27 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 substitutions per amino acid, and the high mutation frequency regions were mainly in the nonstructural protein coding sequences. This study contributed information on the genotype distribution, selection pressure, neutralizing epitope site mutations, recombination events and quasispecies distribution of HAV strains in China. The evolutionary status of genotype I worldwide was also analyzed, which will provide a reference for future HAV molecular epidemiology studies. Moreover, the different phylodynamic approaches sometimes disagree on virus dynamics prior to PAT initiation. I propose to combine and align all available HCV-4a sequences to generate an updated benchmark dataset for testing phylodynamical techniques. I aim to apply methods, taught in this workshop, on evolutionary hypothesis testing, to resolve uncertainty surrounding the epidemic history of Egyptian HCV and hopefully clarify the importance of the PAT campaign. Furthermore, by contrasting and comparing results of existing models on a canonical data set, I hope to gain insight into their relative merits as statistical estimators. This would support my long-term aim of developing richer and more informative Bayesian phylodynamic models. Even though there is evidence of sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) the actual risks in different types of sexual behavior have been difficult to assess and it is still unclear as to which factors actually contribute to this route of transmission. In this study, we report transmission associated with lack of lubrication during sex from fifteen HCV-infected individuals to their heterosexual partners. Forty female patients with symptomatic acute HCV infection were identified at the Viral Hepatitis Laboratory, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. To confirm HCV transmission between spouses, nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction products were submitted to direct nucleotide sequencing of the NS5B region. The obtained sequences were aligned with corresponding nucleotide sequences of twentythree HCV reference sequences retrieved from GenBank and thirteen local unrelated HCV sequences and phylogenetic tree was constructed with Mega 4 software using Neighbor-Joining method. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and their reliability was assessed by bootstrap resampling 1,000 replicates. Among the forty subjects that reported sexual risk behavior, twenty-nine had sexual partners that volunteered samples to investigate possible HCV genomic similarities. The phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of HCV genome was limited to the remaining fifteen subjects and their sexual partners, which revealed nucleotide identity >95% among fourteen of the fifteen couples, which strongly suggests these partners to be the source of infection, after ruling out possible contamination through personal item sharing. These findings provide strong molecular evidence that the women had acquired HCV infection most likely by interspousal sexual transmission. the HDV R0 region by Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-nested PCR. The PCR products were screened with RFLP using SmaI restriction enzymes. Nucleotide sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis for clade determination. In silico analysis for evidence of recombination was also carried out in order to determine the origin of the HDV isolates of interest. PCR-RFLP analysis using SmaI enzyme showed that three of our HDV isolates belonged to genotype II. A deeper nucleotide analysis exposed a single base pair selectively neutral mutation at the single SmaI restriction site within the B cell epitope, which caused these three strains to be falsely categorized as genotype II. Sequences analyzed in silico for recombination showed putative exchange of genetic material within and across genotype I and II. Phylogenetic analysis of our sequences have shown a clear misclassification of genotype in our HDV isolates and proved the shortcomings of HDV genotyping based on PCR-RFLP. Recombination analyses have suggested a possible reason for the high frequency of occurrence of this mutation in our sample. Lassa virus continues to be endemic with frequent outbreak in areas of endemicity which is of a public health concern due to its fast evolutionary rate. There have been reports of new strains in different epidemic outbreaks. We used seven different codon usage bias tools and indexes targeting synonymous codon usage, which included GC content, ENC, SCUO, Codon Volatility, RSCU, Odds ratios and Graphical Codon Usage Analysis tool. This study observed evolutionary patterns in Lassa virus from humans, rodents and bats. It also observed the evolutionary pattern and influence of different geographical locations and periodic outbreaks. There was variation in GC content in the glycoprotein gene, nucleoprotein gene, Z-protein gene, S-protein gene and polymerase gene. RSCU value was positively correlated with the Odds Ratio of dinucleotides in the codons. RSCU values of humans, rodents and bats were slightly different, though this result was not completely true for odds ratios. genotyping was performed using the sequence from the product of GI SKF/SKR and G2 SKF/SKR primers for capsid N/S domain. cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase, SaV detection was performed using SaV124F, SaV1F, SaV5F and SaV1245R as primers and SaV124TP and SaV5TP as probes, genotyping was performed using the sequence from the product of SaV F22 SaV R2 primers for a partial capsid region. Preliminary data indicates the prevalence of NoV was 38%, with NoV GII as the main genotype found in the specimens, and the prevalence of SaV was 9.6%. The genotyping for twenty-two isolates according the partial capsid region was GI \u00bc 7, GII \u00bc 9, GIV \u00bc 4 and GV \u00bc 2, and from these data six samples show co-infection for SaV and NoV. Control nondiarrhetic samples were negative for NoV and SaV. According to these preliminary results, NoV remains an important etiologic agent and SaV seems to be responsible for a substantial number of cases in Lima. SaV detection should be included in future research of viral gastroenteritis epidemiology.",

The reads in fastq format were qualityfiltered using the program FastQC v0.11.3 and any adapter sequences were removed using Trimmomatic-0.33 software.

From 337 serial samples from the 156 patients, we found four groups of patients harboring patterns of mutations located in the critical domain of HBV (promoters, replication regulation domain) associated with phenotypic characteristics such as viral load decrease or seroconversion.

Further analysis to identify clade deterministic amino acid residues yielded very distinct residue changes in HMPVA vs HMPVB for all nine coding regions.

The partial sequences of the translation elongation factor gene (EF-1a) and of the internally transcribed spacers of the rDNA region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) were used in a multi-locus sequence comparison. Additionally, the genetic diversity of ninety-five strains of the FIESC belonging to five different global populations was investigated. Sequence exploration indicated that the aligned DNA sequences of the EF-1a gene were more informative than the ITS sequences based on DNA polymorphism indicators. Phylogenetic relationships, gene flow and the potential for migration of the pathogen across continents are to be determined. Our previous phylogenetic studies implicate the vampire bat species Desmodus rotundus as the source of rabies virus (RABV) outbreaks in the Caribbean island of Trinidad and provide evidence for RABV importation from the nearby South American mainland on at least three occasions between 1972 and 2010, each with subsequent in situ lineage expansion. RABV activity in Trinidad is greatest in the southwestern peninsula closest to the mainland. The main method of control is chemical culling of vampire populations, which can indiscriminately affect co-roosting non-vampire species. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of D. rotundus population dynamics and mainland-island movement in determining patterns of RABV activity in Trinidad. Between February 2012 and August 2013, 103 D. rotundus were collected at various locations in Trinidad (primarily during routine eradication exercises by the Anti-Rabies Unit of the Ministry of Food Production). They were humanely euthanized and swabs (oral and rectal), blood and tissue samples were harvested using all appropriate laboratory safety precautions. Samples were then frozen (\u00c080 C) until further use. D. rotundus from selected areas in South America (Venezuela, Suriname, Guyana) will be captured and similarly processed. Genomic DNA will be extracted from tissue samples and comparative bat population genetic analysis will be performed using the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and selected microsatellite markers. Bat tissues will be screened for RABV using rabies-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RABV seroprevalence will also be determined. The BEAST software package will be used on data sets of derived and previously published viral sequences to infer evolutionary relationships, population dynamics and patterns of gene flow. D. rotundus population sizes will also be estimated using partial roost counts and capture/recapture data. The relationship between bat population dynamics in Trinidad and movements estimated from the bat population genetic analyses, and patterns of RABV gene flow and outbreaks will then be investigated. and genome viewing in GBrowse. A personal Workbench space is also provided to the user for saving and sharing sequences, searches and analysis results for future use. The data management and analysis tools have been designed to facilitate the research and development of diagnostics, prophylactics and therapeutics against these human virus pathogens.",

BLAST analysis showed a high percentage identity with strain 02AG/G. Our results confirm the presence of multiple URFs of HIV-1 in the recently diagnosed seropositive population. Analysis of the fulllength genomes of the respective viruses would be required to confirm whether they are the result of recombination in single dually infected individuals or are new CRFs.Although in Europe there is a significant decrease in the number of newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections related to injecting drug use, Romania exhibits important HIV outbreaks in this vulnerable population: until 2010, the percentage of newly diagnosed HIV cases attributable to IDU was insignificant (<1.5%) reaching 30% in 2012 and 2013 and 21% in 2014. Our aim was to analyze the pattern of HIV subtypes and the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in a group of treatment-naive injecting drug users, newly diagnosed with HIV infection between 2010 and 2014. We studied a group of fifty injecting drug users, out of which thirtytwo (64%) were HIV-1 infected. Pol gene sequencing was performed using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Abbott Laboratories, USA) and HIV subtype was determined using the REGA HIV-1 subtyping tool. TDR-associated mutations were defined by the WHO 2009 surveillance mutation list. For phylogenetic analysis, maximum likelihood trees were generated for each subtype, using PHYML implemented in Geneious (Biomatters, Auckland); for network clustering analysis, a pairwise distance comparison of all sequences was generated and putative transmission links inferred when two sequences had a genetic distance <1.5%. Although HIV subtype F1 (which has dominated the Romanian epidemic since 1990) remains prevalent (65.6%), other subtypes were frequently detected: subtype G was predominant (18.7%), followed by subtype B (9.3%), and G/B recombinant and CRF 14_BG (3.1%). Overall, the proportion of HIV infections involving non-F subtypes increased from 23% in 2010-12 to 37% in 2013-14. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that nineteen out of the thirty-two (59.3%) patients are assigned in two different clusters: a large clade F cluster including sixteen individuals and a small clade G of three sequences cluster; the high genetic similarity between sequences suggests the existence of local networks of HIV transmission among IDUs. No major transmitted drug resistance mutations were identified. A high proportion of newly diagnosed HIV-1 infected injection drug users were grouped in transmission clusters, indicating a continuing potential for increased HIV transmission and future outbreaks among IDUs, and pointing to the need for implementing effective prevention interventions.A27 Phylogenetic reconstruction of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic from a native community in Argentina unravels the impact of viral adaptation on disease progression D.C.

Novel tools such as molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis, when used in combination with traditional epidemiological techniques, have demonstrated the potential to answer critical questions that are not easily answered by epidemiological approaches alone. I propose to combine traditional epidemiology with molecular methods to understand the transmission dynamics of two contrasting infections: HIV-1 and Ebola. These are two of the most serious epidemics in the last 50 years and I plan to study them at the geographical epicenters. Combining and adapting these tools might enhance real-time epidemic surveillance and inform evidence-based, innovative and targeted intervention strategies, leading to an improved global response.A29 Viral escape pathways and determinants of neutralization breadth in early human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection A.S.A.

Previous studies have traced the origin of the Brazilian HIV-1C epidemic (HIV-1C_BR) to an introduction to the state of Paran a from an east African country. The fact that HIV-1C infections increase at a higher rate than HIV-1B in Brazil calls for a better understanding of the process of spatial spread in Brazil. Previous phylogeographic studies have mainly focused on Brazilian capital cities. Here, we analyzed about 500 pol and env HIV-1C Brazilian sequences obtained from samples collected throughout thirteen cities and from public databases. A Bayesian phylogeographic Generalized Linear Model approach was used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of HIV-1C in Brazil and included several potential explanatory predictors of the viral diffusion process. Analyses were performed on several subsampled datasets in order to mitigate for sample bias. Our results revealed that Porto Alegre city has a central role in the HIV-1C_BR spread and that the prevalence of HIV, as well as the population size of subtype C, are factors driving the epidemic expansion towards the north of Brazil.",

The cervicovaginal microbiome plays an important role in female reproductive health, affecting rates of preterm-birth and neonate mortality; prevalence, susceptibility to, and transmissibility of sexually transmitted infections (including HIV); and other important clinical conditions. Despite its importance, however, little is known about how cervicovaginal microbiome communities differ in function and, more importantly, how their constituent members interact with each other and the host to form a dynamic ecosystem that responds to various host and environmental factors. We used a nested case-control design to investigate the cervical microbiome in ninety-four HPV16-positive cervical samples from the Persistence and Progression (PaP) Cohort, a collaborative study with the NCI and KPNC. There were forty-four controls and fifty cases with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia Grade 3 (CIN3). To characterize the microbiome, we PCR amplified an approximately 145 bp fragment spanning the V6 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Each sample was amplified using a unique barcoded primer set. Barcoded PCR products were pooled at approximately equal molar DNA concentrations and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2,000 platform at Einstein. The NGS reads ($100 millions) were processed using two-third part taxonomy algorithms, usearch and pplacer, and additional bioinformatics tools developed in-house. Classification tables were generated from input data at the species-level, based on the vaginal 16S rRNA sequence database. The characterized reads were organized using a heat map and squash clustering. Pairwise Kantorovich-Rubinstein distances were calculated for principal component analysis and Simpson diversity indices to evaluate the difference of cervical microbiome communities between case and control groups. The cervical microbiome of the forty-four controls revealed two predominant genera, Lactobacillus and Gardnerella, consistent with previous reports of female reproductive tract microbiota. Thirtyfive (80%) control samples were dominated by one or more species of Lactobacillus that constituted 86% of all Illumina reads. All five types of vaginal communities previously defined that are predominated by Lactobacillus crispatus (type I, 27%), Lactobacillus gasseri (type II, 5%), Lactobacillus iners (type III, 43%) and Lactobacillus jensenii (type V, 5%). The type IV community group (20%) lacked detectable Lactobacillus spp., but contained other bacterial groups with high proportions of anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella, Prevotella, Sutterella, Atopobium, Sneathia, Eggerthella, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Streptococcus. The CIN3 group had similar cervical microbiome communities, but showed significantly higher measures of diversity compared with the control group (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon P < 0.05).A60 Next-generation sequencing highlights unique aspects of Ebola virus (EBOV) biology and provides novel diagnostic platforms.R.

The mortality rate from filovirus infection can approach 90% and there are currently no approved filovirus vaccines or therapeutics. We seek to better understand filovirus biology to aid in our ability to design effective antiviral treatments. Through next generation sequencing (NGS), our collaborative work has uncovered unique features of filovirus transcription, replication, protein translation and innate immune evasion. We have deep sequenced RNAs produced by Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) and the Angola strain of Marburgvirus (Ang) to identify novel viral and cellular mechanisms that diversify the coding and non-coding sequences of filovirus RNAs (PMID: 25370495). Moreover, we have applied sequenceindependent NGS methods to further define how the EBOV protein VP35 antagonizes the human innate immune response, specifically by detecting immunostimulatory RNAs bound by VP35. Improving diagnostic assays that rapidly detect EBOV infection are critical to quickly identify and respond to EBOV infection. Toward this goal, our work has validated an Ion AmpliSeq Ebola Panel Assay in collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific. We will discuss data from each of these studies to illustrate how NGS can improve our understanding and diagnosis of this lethal pathogen.

Strong bottlenecks (e.g. viral entry, virion production, immune evasion) shape the emergence and frequency of viral variants and new phenotypes. Therefore, deep sequencing of the viral quasispecies over a time course of infection provides invaluable information regarding biological processes and outcome in a single host. We sequenced viral RNA from multiple serum samples from West African patients infected with Ebola virus strain Makona, as well as from non-human primates infected with Ebola virus strain Kikwit, and identified intrahost single nucleotide polymorphisms (iSNPs) at >0.5% frequency. Using phylogenetic tools, we aim to gauge the amount of viral diversity in the quasispecies and determine if diversity increases (diversifying selection) or decreases (purifying selection) over time. Moreover, emergence or disappearance of iSNPs can help us identify biological bottlenecks shaping the viral quasispecies. Taken together, these studies will shed light on the forces molding Ebola virus evolution in individual hosts during the course of infection, and will help identify biological processes to disrupt during design of vaccines and therapeutics.A63 Within-host diversity informs Ebola virus transmission analysis S.

Sabeti 1,2 Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, 3 University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK and 4 Scripps Translational Science Institute, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA During a disease outbreak, reconstructing transmission chains is an important tool for curtailing disease and evaluating control measures.Recent studies have shown that inferring outbreak transmission trees from both epidemiologic and genomic data produces better results than epidemiological tracing alone, especially during large outbreaks with sparse epidemiological records. Transmission tree investigation could be further improved by incorporating within-host variation, which has yet to be done, largely because extensive intrahost data have not typically been available during an outbreak. We have deep sequencing data available for over 200 Ebola virus genomes from 2013 to 2015 epidemic in Western Africa and have identified sites of intrahost variation in these samples. In this dataset, we observe several within-host variants that are shared among two or more patients, often spanning several months of the ebola epidemic. We conclude that these shared variants are due-at least in part-to the transmission of multiple viral genomes, which implies that the transmission bottleneck is wide enough to facilitate the transmission of intermediate-frequency variants. This finding can be used to better resolve transmission chains during an ebola outbreak.",

Cummins *Corresponding author The University of the West Indies Cave Hill Campus, Bridgetown, Barbados In 2000-3, a decline in yields by >50% was observed in some sweet potato fields in Barbados and symptoms of yellowing, swollen leaf veins and deep grooves on the tubers suggested the possibility of Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD). SVPD is a complex synergy of several virus species belonging to the two main genera: Potyviridae and Closterivirdiae and other minor viruses. This study sought to characterize the viruses in the SVPD complex affecting sweet potato varieties in Barbados by using PCR amplification of viral RNA and genomic siRNA sequencing of affected sweet potato leaves. Initial PCR of viral RNA using specific primers only detected the Potyvirus SPFMV. Deep sequencing however revealed the presence of several DNA viruses. Geminiviridae (genus Begomovirus) and Caulimoviridae (genus Badnavirus) accounted for >75% of the viruses found in the sweet potato leaf phytobiome in Barbados. The results possibly suggest new virus associations in the leaf phytobiome, largely composed of symptomless DNA viruses previously unreported in the Caribbean, in sweet potato.

Due to the lack of sequence homology, further in situ analysis may be required to target and identify the MGEs within the hosts' environment. This research represents the first documented analysis on the CRISPR-Cas operon structure and spacer elements in F. acidarmanus.

            "text": "Bioinformatics has implemented different strategies to distinguish driver genes from passenger genes. One of the more recent strategies is a pathway-oriented approach. Methods that employ this strategy are highly dependent on the quality and size of the pathway interaction network, and require a powerful statistical environment for their analysis. Existing genomic libraries are available in the R-Bioconductor package. One of these packages, DriverNet is a pathway-based method that uses a gene interaction network in the form of an adjacency matrix. In our analysis we set out to combine data from three different networks (VarWalker, DawnRank and DNA tumor viruses) for analysis. We found this increased the sensitivity and specificity of the identification of driver genes significantly. Human interaction data from the families of DNA tumor viruses: Human Papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr Virus, Adenovirus and Polyomavirus were incorporated into the combined network. An enriched data set was produced that included 11,648 genes and 211,894 edges. Multiple hypothesis testing has become a major research topic once again because of the emergence of differential expression in high dimensional genomics data. Traditional methods like Bonferroni's correction which controls the family wise error rate is inappropriate when it comes to high dimensional data. As a result, research into false discovery rates (FDRs) is becoming increasingly popular. The local FDR (lFDR) developed by Bradley Efron has a Bayesian flavor. This Bayesian approach presents a simple way of accounting for dependence among the genes. However, the main drawback of Efron's lFDR is that it can only be computed if the proportion of null hypotheses is high (usually above 0.80). We develop an lFDR method which relies on the likelihood ratio. We show the efficacy of our methods via simulations of microarray data. Our method can be extended to discrete tests as well. The CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) Cas operon has been shown to consist of genes involved in adaptive immunity, gene repair, gene regulation and genome remodelling. Here we report on the annotation of two CRISPR-Cas operons located in the acidophilic Euryarchaeum, Ferroplasma acidarmanus fer1. The presence of CRISPR spacer elements within the analyzed genome may represent a chronological order of the acquisitions of protospacer sequences from prior infections by Mobile Genetic Elements (MGEs). Potential direct repeats, spacer sequences and associated Cas genes within the fer1 genome were detected using the CRISPRdb database from the Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud 11 web server. Further searches within IMG, BioCyc, UniProt and NCBI databases were done to detect other potential orthologs in fer1. The information was then used to manually annotate proteins and spacer sequences using the Geni-Act toolbox, and characterize the structure of two Cas operons. Manual annotation identified two CRISPR operons of Type I. This type of CRISPR is known to target DNA MGEs. Remarkably, no significant sequence similarity was observed between the detected spacer sequences and known MGEs within the NCBI database (nr),",

Andrea-Marobela, 1 We found a frequency of 26.5% for N348I mutation among HIV-1C patients experiencing virologic failure in Botswana. The association of the N348I mutation with virologic failure in this population warrants further investigation but in this cohort it seemed to be more closely linked with non-nucleoside RT inhibitor failure than with AZT failure. The kinetics of the mutation in relation to other RT mutations also needs to be investigated to better understand its impact. The echovirus 3 (E3) serotype has been associated with several neurologic diseases, although it constitutes one of the most rarely isolated serotypes, with no report of epidemics in Europe. The aim of this study was to provide insights into the molecular epidemiology and evolution of this enterovirus serotype; an E3 strain was isolated from sewage in Greece, 4 years after the initial isolation of the only reported E3 strain in the same geographical region. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP1 genomic region of that E3 strain and of those available in GenBank suggested three main genogroups that were further subdivided into seven subgenogroups. Further evolutionary analysis suggested that the VP1 genomic region of E3 was dominated by purifying selection, as the vast majority of genetic diversity presumably occurred through synonymous nucleotide substitutions and the substitution rate for complete and partial VP1 sequences was calculated to be 8.13 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 and 7.72 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 substitutions/site/year, respectively. The partial VP1 sequence analysis revealed the composite epidemiology of this serotype, as the strains of the three genogroups presented different epidemiological characteristics. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) HIV/AIDS guidelines proposed CD4 >500 cells/ul as the threshold to start HAART. Last year, the Brazilian government introduced Therapy as Prevention (TasP) in the HIV/AIDS guidelines and will treat all HIV infected patients at diagnosis, independent of the CD4 values. Notwithstanding the benefits the early treatment might bring to the control of HIV-1 transmission; TasP might also contribute to the increase of transmission of resistance mutations in Brazil and reduce the effects of the program in medium-term. We reviewed >5000 patients with a stored serum/plasma sample at HIV-1 diagnosis between 2003-2014, and included 2% of them in a study aiming at evaluating HIV-1 genetic diversity, transmission of resistance mutation, coreceptor use, and clinical outcome. For this purpose, we performed pol and V3 loop genotyping, collected epidemiological information and reviewed the clinical history. We plan to investigate subtype distribution, TDR prevalence and potential associated transmission chains, in silico fitness using protease fitness landscape predictions, predicted coreceptor use using Geno2Pheno, and associate these variables with epidemiological and clinical information. Thus, the data generated from this analysis will be used to establish a reference dataset to study the impact of TasP in Brazil prospectively. Virus Evolution, 2016, Vol. 2, Suppl. 1 ",
