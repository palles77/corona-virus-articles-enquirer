RUB defective interfering (DI) RNAs contain deletions within the SP-ORF and thus resemble replicons. DI RNAs often retain the 5\u2032 end of the capsid protein (C) gene which has been shown to modulate virus-specific RNA synthesis. However, when replicons either with or without the C gene were passaged serially in the presence of wt RUB as a source of the virion proteins, it was found that neither replicon was maintained and DI RNAs were generated. The majority DI RNA species contained in-frame deletions in the SP-ORF leading to a fusion between the 5\u2032 end of the C gene and the 3\u2032 end of the E1 glycoprotein gene. DI infectious cDNA clones were constructed and transcripts from these DI infectious cDNA clones were maintained during serial passage with wt RUB. The C-E1 fusion protein encoded by the DI RNAs was synthesized and was required for maintenance of the DI RNA during serial passage. This is the first report of a functional novel gene product resulting from deletion during DI RNA generation. Thus far, the role of the C-E1 fusion protein in maintenance of DI RNAs during serial passage remained elusive as it was found that the fusion protein diminished rather than enhanced DI RNA synthesis and was not incorporated into virus particles.",

In some cases, these cis-acting elements overlap with the protein coding region, making them difficult to identify and study using genomic infectious cDNA vectors. A commonly used alternate approach has been to employ defective interfering (DI) RNAs (Levis et al., 1986; White et al., 1998) . DI RNAs are produced by practically all viruses and contain partially deleted genomes that are spontaneously generated during viral genome replication. Due to the deletion, most DI RNAs fail to replicate autonomously and require co-infection with wt helper virus to provide replication and encapsidation proteins for propagation. DI RNAs are of interest because they maintain CAEs required for replication. Therefore, DI cDNA constructs are generally used in place of genomic infectious cDNA vectors since they are smaller and mutations can be generated without regard for coding sequences. DI RNAs containing reporter proteins have been developed that make assay procedures easier since reporter gene expression correlates with DI RNA replication (Barclay et al., 1998; Izeta et al., 1999; Khromykh and Westaway, 1997; Levis et al., 1987; Molenkamp et al., 2000; Tzeng et al., 2001) .",

DI RNAs generated during undiluted passage of RUB consistently retain the NS-ORF but contain heterogeneous deletions between the NS-ORF and the 3\u2032 cis -acting elements and thus have the ability to replicate and frequently to synthesize a SG RNA. These DI RNAs are thus very similar to RUB replicons that we have developed in which the SP-ORF is replaced with a reporter gene (Tzeng et al., 2001) . We recently showed that the RUB C protein can modulate replicon RNA synthesis by upregulating the synthesis of the genomic RNA relative to the SG RNA (Tzeng and Frey, 2005) . The current study was initiated by the hypothesis that the residual fragment of the C gene frequently retained in RUB DI RNAs was of benefit to the DI RNA by increasing the relative level of DI genome synthesis. Unexpectedly, we found that it was actually a C-E1 fusion protein created by the deletion in the DI RNA that was of benefit and conferred upon a DI RNA the ability to be maintained during serial undiluted passage.",

            "text": "To test the hypothesis that the presence of part of the C gene conferred a selective advantage on a RUB DI RNA by upregulating the synthesis of the DI genomic RNA, the maintenance of two RUB replicons during serial passage with wt RUB was tested. The first replicon, RUBrep/ GFP, expresses the reporter gene GFP and synthesizes a low level of genomic RNA relative to SG RNA (molar ratio of genome/SG ~0.25) while the second replicon, RUBrep/C-GFP, expresses a C-GFP fusion protein and synthesizes a higher level of genomic RNA relative to SG RNA (genome/SG ~ 0.75) (Tzeng and Frey, 2005) Fig. 1A ). Vero cells were transfected with one of these replicons and co-infected with wt RUB and subsequently six serial undiluted passages of the transfected/infected culture fluid were made. Passage of the replicons was detected by GFP expression and additionally virus-and replicon-specific RNAs present in cells after each passage were analyzed by Northern blot. Surprisingly, very few cells exhibited GFP expression in passages of both replicons beyond the transfected/infected culture (termed P0) (data not shown) and the genomic and SG RNAs of both replicons were barely detectable in the P0 culture and essentially undetectable in passages 1-2 (P1-2). Thus neither replicon was efficiently transmitted in the presence of wt helper virus, disproving the hypothesis. In the passage series with both replicons, at P3 an RNA band appeared that was smaller than the genomic RNA, but of different size than either replicon genomic RNA. Concomitantly, the intensity of this band increased in P4-5, but decreased in P6 while the intensity of the virus genomic RNA decreased in P4-5 and recovered in P6, indicating the generation of de novo DI RNAs. To evaluate these de novo DI RNAs, RT-PCR of the total cell RNA extracted from these passages was employed using primers spanning the SP-ORF, the region in which deletions in RUB DI RNAs characteristically occur (Fig. 1C) . Heterodisperse RT-PCR products were produced from P4-6 RNA of both replicons that were smaller than the RT-PCR product produced from the parent replicon. Despite the heterodisperse nature of the RT-PCR products, a predominant band of ~1300 bp was produced from P5-6 of both replicons. The RT-PCR products from P5 of both passage series were cloned and several clones were sequenced to determine the deletions present. As shown in Table 1 , the population of deletions was heterogeneous, similar to our previous study (Derdeyn and Frey, 1995) . Comparing the deletions in the replicons with which the serial passage series were initiated and the deletions in the resulting DI clones, most of the DIs were generated from wt RUB and relatively few could have been generated from either wt RUB or the replicon ( Table 1 ). The sequence from the downstream deletion break point to the 3\u2032 end of the clone, a region containing the 3\u2032 cisacting elements with the exception of the 3\u2032 six nts (which were present in the primer used for RT-PCR amplification), were identical in all of the DI clones to the corresponding sequence in wt RUB and both replicons (data not shown).",

Since the breakpoints of the deletion in this DI-RNA were in the middle of codons, creating a novel proline codon (CCC) in the C-E1 fusion protein, in one of these constructs (DI-1.1F) the FLAG epitope was placed upstream of this codon and in the second (DI-1.2F) the FLAG epitope was placed downstream of this codon. When cells transfected with these DI constructs were co-infected with wt RUB followed by five serial undiluted passages, DI genomic and SG RNAs were maintained throughout the five passages ( Fig. 2C ). To prove that the input DI RNA was preserved through five passages, RT-PCR was performed on total cell RNA extracted after P5 with primers spanning the SP-ORF. With both DI's, a single band was obtained that when subjected directly to sequencing (without cloning) yielded the sequence of the input DI-RNA (data not shown).",

As shown in Fig. 2B , this species was synthesized and its abundance was maintained (DI-1.2F) or increased (DI-1.1F) through the passage series. When translation of the fusion protein was blocked by incorporating into the DI-1.1F and DI-1.2F constructs a mutation that replaced the two inframe AUGs at the 5\u2032 end of the C gene (these are separated by seven codons) with AUA and GTC ( (Tzeng and Frey, 2005 )(see diagram in Fig 2B) , neither DI was maintained past P0 in a serial undiluted passage series with wt RUB (data not shown) and thus synthesis of the fusion protein is necessary for DI maintenance during serial undiluted passage. To more rapidly screen for DI RNA maintenance during a passage series, two further DI constructs were generated that placed GFP at the deletion point either upstream (DI-1.1G) or downstream (DI-1.2G) from the proline codon created by the deletion (Fig. 2B ). As shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, both of these DI's were maintained through a serial undiluted passage series in the presence of wt RUB as determined by either fluorescence microscopy of the cells or by Northern blot of RNA extracted from the cells using a GFP probe. To determine if the presence of the C-terminus of E1 as part of the fusion protein was necessary for DI maintenance during serial undiluted passage in the presence of wt RUB, a stop codon was introduced between the GFP and E1 in the DI-1.1G and DI-1.2G constructs (producing DI-1.1GZ and DI-1.2GZ, respectively). As shown in Figs. 2D and E, neither of these constructs was efficiently transmitted past P0 in a passage series with wt RUB and thus the inclusion of the C-terminal E1 domain in the fusion was necessary for DI maintenance during serial passage.",

As shown in Fig. 4 , through day 3 post-transfection, RUBrep/C-GFP exhibited a more rapid accumulation of both genomic and subgenomic RNA and a greater accumulation of genomic RNA relative to subgenomic RNA than did RUBrep/ GFP, illustrating the C protein mediated enhancement of replicon RNA synthesis and modulation of genomic/SG RNA ratio that we reported previously (Tzeng and Frey, 2005; Tzeng et al., 2006) . Surprisingly, both DI's accumulated substantially less of both RNA species and thus enhancement of RNA synthesis played no role in the maintenance of these DI RNAs during serial passage with wt RUB (the genomic/SG RNA ratio exhibited by the DI's resembled that of RUBrep/GFP, i.e. no relative increase in the amount of genomic RNA synthesized despite the presence of the N-terminus of the C protein in the C-E1 fusion). The DI-1.1GZ and DI-1.2GZ mutants exhibited RNA accumulation intermediate between the replicons, indicating that the E1 portion of the C-E1 fusion protein was important in downregulating DI RNA synthesis in comparison to replicons.",

Thus, RUB DI RNAs generated during serial passage require the expression of two ORF's, the NS-ORF and the SP-ORF with a deletion leading to production of the C-E1 fusion protein. DI RNAs of many other virus genera and families, e.g. Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus of the alphavirus genus of the Togavirus family, are reduced to ~25% or less of the genome, retain only the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 cis -acting elements, and encode no proteins (Lehtovaara et al., 1982; Levis et al., 1986; White et al., 1998) . In contrast, DI RNAs of both Picornaviruses and Flaviviruses contain in-frame deletions in the structural protein genes at the 5\u2032 end of the single ORF contained by the genomes of these viruses, both of which require translation of a genomic or DI RNA prior to its use as a template for replication (Hagino-Yamagishi and Nomoto, 1989; Lancaster et al., 1998) . The maintenance of the NS-ORF by RUB DI-RNAs is also mandated by a strong cis preference by replicase components for replicating the genome from which they were encoded, rendering replication of a DI RNA by replicase components supplied in trans by helper wt RUB a low probability occurrence (Adams et al., 2003; Liang and Gillam, 2001; Tzeng et al., 2001) . Interestingly, it was recently found that DI RNAs of the alphavirus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE), generated during serial passage retain proteins nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 from the NS-ORF and it was shown that expression of these proteins in cis was required for packaging of VEE replicons into virus particles (Volkova et al., 2006) .",

However, although this part of the C protein was included in the C-E1 fusion protein ( Fig. 2A) , RNA synthesis by DI constructs was substantially reduced in comparison to replicons or DI mutants with a stop codon preventing translation of the E1 part of the fusion protein. Thus, C-mediated enhancement and modulation of RNA synthesis plays no role in DI RNA maintenance during serial passage. We have now done two studies of DI populations generated during serial passage [ (Derdeyn and Frey, 1995) and this study], each of which included two passages, and while DI RNAs with deletions in the SP-ORF were identified in all four of the passages, in two of the passages (P12 in the earlier study and RUBrep/GFP + wt RUB in this study as summarized in Table 2 ) the 5\u2032 breakpoint of the deletion in up to half or more of the DI RNAs was upstream of the SG RNA start site, rendering the DI RNA incapable of synthesizing either a SG RNA or a C-E1 fusion protein. While this finding potentially indicates that DI RNAs without a C-E1 fusion protein can be successfully passaged, it was not determinable if such DI RNAs had been generated de novo during the passage that was sampled or had been generated in previous passages (and thus successfully passaged). It is possible that the C-E1 fusion protein is capable of functioning in trans leading to maintenance of DI RNAs that do not synthesize a C-E1 fusion protein during serial passage as long as DI RNAs that synthesize such a protein are also present in the population. In this regard, the C-E1 fusion protein could also exert an effect in trans on helper wt RUB replication.",

            "text": "The function of C-E1 fusion protein synthesized by RUB DI RNAs is unknown. The topology of the C-E1 fusion protein synthesized by DI-1, the DI construct analyzed in the study, is shown in Fig. 2A . Within the C part of the fusion protein are the RNA binding domain, the phosphorylated peptide including the serine 46 residue that controls phosphorylation, the region involved in enhancement and modulation of RNA synthesis, and the mitochondrial p32 protein binding site while within the E1 part of the fusion protein are the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. The presence of the E1 transmembrane domain suggests that the C-E1 fusion protein is membrane associated. Interestingly, C itself is membrane associated via the E2 signal sequence that is retained at its C-terminus (the C-GFP fusion protein synthesized by the RUBrep/C-GFP replicon used in this study also retains the E2 signal sequence). However, the C-E1 fusion protein may have a different intracellular localization than does C and possibly the binding of DI RNA by the C part of the C-E1 fusion protein and its alternate intracellular localization dictated by the E1 part of the C-E1 fusion protein could explain the downregulation of DI RNA synthesis that the C-E1 fusion protein mediates. Despite the putative association of the C-E1 fusion protein with membranes, it was not incorporated into virus particles and thus does not appear to be involved in packaging of DI RNAs into virus particles. Consistent with this observation, we recently found that the packaging efficiency of DI and RUBrep/GFP replicon transcripts was similar in cells co-infected with wt RUB or a line of BHK cells that constitutively express the SP-ORF (C. Claus, unpublished observations). Resolution of the function of the C-E1 fusion protein in DI maintenance during serial passaging thus awaits further experimentation.",

RUBrep/GFP and RUBrep/C-GFP were linearized with EcoRI, while the DI constructs were linearized with SpeI prior to in vitro transcription, which was carried out as previously described (Tzeng and Frey, 2002) . The in vitro transcription reaction mixtures were used directly for transfection without DNase treatment or phenol-chloroform extraction. Vero cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as previously described (Tzeng and Frey, 2002) . For low magnification fluorescence microscopy (10 or 20X objective, cells were examined directly without fixation using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with epifluorescence capacity. Total cell RNA was extracted and virus-, replicon-, and DI-specific RNA species present were detected by Northern blot (Tzeng and Frey, 2002) using a NorthernMax-Gly Kit (Ambion; Houston, TX) and nick-translated, 32 P-labeled pGEM-GFP-3\u2032CAE or pGEM-GFP as a probe. To detect intracellular synthesis of the C-E1 fusion, Western blot analysis of cell lysates (Tzeng et al., 2006) was performed using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma). To detect the C-E1 fusion protein in virus particles, cells were infected with wt RUB or infected with wt RUB and co-transfected with DI-1.2G, the medium was passaged once (P1), and the P1 medium was collected three days post-passage. Following purification of virus particles on discontinuous potassium tartrate gradients, resolution of proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed using either anti-E1, E2 and C monoclonal antibodies (Viral Antigens) or antibodies against GFP (Clonetech) as previously described (Zheng et al., 2003) . Passaging of replicons in presence of wt RUB. A). At the top of the panel are genomic diagrams of RUB (Robo502) and both replicons. The relative positions of the RT-PCR primers are shown and the amplicon size expected from each genome is given on the right margin. Repliconspecific genomic (rG) and subgenomic (rSG) RNA's were assayed by Northern blot in extracts of cells transfected with transcripts from RUBrep/GFP or RUBrep/C-GFP constructs (lower panel). The probe used was pGEM-GFP, a plasmid containing GFP gene. B). Cells were infected with wt RUB (MOI = 1) and 24 hours later were transfected with RUBrep/GFP or RUBrep/C-GFP transcripts and the culture fluid was harvested 2 days post-transfection and one tenth of the culture was used to infect fresh cells. This passaging procedure was repeated for six passages and the medium was harvested 2~3 days post-infection. Following medium harvest after each passage, total cell RNA was extracted from the cell monolayer. Northern blot was used to assay for RUB-and replicon-specific RNA's in each of the passages using pGEM-GFP-3\u2032CSE probe, a plasmid containing the GFP gene and the 3\u2032 300 nt of the RUB genome (the RUB 3\u2032 cis-acting element or 3\u2032CAE; extracts from RUBrep/GFP and RUBrep/ C-GFP-transfected cells were included as controls. C). Total cell RNA from P0 and P4-6 was used as a template for RT-PCR using primers spanning the SP-ORF.

Shown are schematic diagrams of the RUB SP-ORF and the C-E1 fusion protein with the location of transmembrane domains (TM), cytoplasmic tails (CT), signal sequences, and N-linked glycosylation sites within the glycoproteins and the RNA and p32 binding domains, which including two arginine clusters, and the S46 phosphorylation control site within C. B). DI infectious cDNA constructs. Under the genomic diagrams of Robo 502, RUBrep/GFP, and DI-1, are a series of DI constructs that incorporate either a FLAG epitope (\"F\" constructs) or GFP (\"G\" constructs) at the break point in DI-1. The deletion in DI-1 created a novel proline residue (P) that was placed at the C terminus of the FLAG or GFP insert in DI-1.1 constructs and at the N-terminus of the FLAG or GFP insert in DI-1.2 constructs. In DI-1.1F-1411* and DI-1.2F-1411*, the two in-frame AUGs at the beginning of the C gene were changed to AUA and GTC to eliminate translation of the fusion protein. In the DI-1.1GZ and DI-1.2GZ constructs, a termination codon (Z) was placed at the 3\u2032 end of the GFP insert. C). Passaging of DI-1.1F and DI-1.2F in the presence of wt RUB. Transfection of wt RUBinfected cells with DI-1.1F and DI-1.2F transcripts, serial passaging, and detection of intracellular RUB-specific RNA species were done as described in the Legend to Fig. 1 ; intracellular RNA from DI-1.1F and DI-1.2F-transfected cells were included as controls. Virus (v) and DI genomic (G) and subgenomic (SG) RNAs are denoted. In addition, Western blots of cell lysates at each passage were probed for production of the C-FLAG-E1 fusion protein using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M= lysate from mock-infected cells). Only the region from the Western blot containing the fusion protein (~23.9 kDa) is shown. GFP as a marker for DI RNA maintenance during serial passage. Wt RUB transfected cells were co-transfected with DI-1.1G, DI-1.2G, DI-1.1GZ, or DI-1.2GZ and five serial passages were performed. Following each passage, the cultures were examined for GFP expression by fluorescence microscopy at low magnification (10X objective) (Panel A) and subsequently total cellular RNA was extracted and assayed for DI-specific RNA species by Northern blot using pGEM-GFP as a probe (only the DI RNA species are detected using this probe). RNA synthesis in DI-1 vs replicon transfected cells. Total RNA was extracted from cells transfected with RUBrep/GFP, RUBrep/C-GFP, DI-1.1G, DI-1.2G, DI-1.1GZ or DI-1.2GZ on 1, 2, and 3 days post-transfection (dpt) and virus-specific RNAs were assayed by Northern blot probed with pGEM-GFP. Equal amounts of total cell RNA were applied to the replicon and DI-GZ lanes while twice as much total cell RNA was applied to the DI lanes. Since the genome band was faint in some of the lanes, an extended exposure of the genome bands is shown below the complete blot. Tzeng and Frey Page 15 Virology.
