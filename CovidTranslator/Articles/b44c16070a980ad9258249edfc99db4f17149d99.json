            "text": "Color may be very useful to visualise complex data. As far as taxonomy is concerned, color may help observing various species' characteristics in correlation with classification. However, choosing the number of subclasses to display is often a complex task: on the one hand, assigning a limited number of colors to taxa of interest hides the structure imbedded in the subtrees of the taxonomy; on the other hand, differentiating a high number of taxa by giving them specific colors, without considering the underlying taxonomy, may lead to unreadable results since relationships between displayed taxa would not be supported by the color code. In the present paper, an automatic color coding scheme is proposed to visualise the levels of taxonomic relationships displayed as overlay on any kind of data plot. To achieve this goal, a dimensionality reduction method allows displaying taxonomic \"distances\" onto a Euclidean two-dimensional space. The resulting map is projected onto a 2D color space (the Hue, Saturation, Brightness colorimetric space with brightness set to 1). Proximity in the taxonomic classification corresponds to proximity on the map and is therefore materialised by color proximity. As a result, each species is related to a color code showing its position in the taxonomic tree. The so called ColorPhylo displays taxonomic relationships intuitively and can be combined with any biological result. A Matlab version of ColorPhylo is available at http://sy.lespi.free.fr/ColorPhylo-homepage.html. Meanwhile, an ad-hoc distance in case of taxonomy with unknown edge lengths is proposed.",

In particular, the Darwin's evolution theory ensures that the relationships between species can be expressed within a tree (named \"phylogenic tree\"/\"taxonomic tree\"). However, the exploration of large trees (and graphs) is not easy. 1 Visualising taxonomy together with other pieces of information (obtained from various biological analyses for example) is often extremely instructive; some examples can be found in. [2] [3] [4] In those cases, a level of granularity of the tree is usually chosen and a color is assigned to each subclass thus defined. 4 Several drawbacks can be easily identified. The granularity level is obviously subject to arbitrariness. Moreover, proximity relationships between subclasses are ignored as well as their subdivisions.",

An automatic coloring tool for tree exploration has been proposed by Fua and co-authors: 5, 6 in order to explore a given taxonomy, leaves are considered as an ordered list of items (the order can result for example from the reading direction when the tree is displayed on a phylogram). Each node can then be related to a color according to a chosen LUT (Look-Up Table) . The LUT may be locally stretched or compressed in order to focus on a given area. Such an interactive control of the LUT allows exploring the taxonomy while considering various depths. This approach suffers however from a major shortcoming: the leaf ordering is not unique (trees are invariant with respect to permutation of linked branches). Very different colorings can then result from various choices. Moreover, close colors can correspond to items that belong to different branches and somewhat different colors can rely to close species. These drawbacks can be observed in Figures 6 and 8 .",

            "text": "Node coloring is of main concern in Self-Organising Map (SOM) framework. 9,10 SOM is a non-linear dimensionality reduction method. It is designed to map items (generally from a high dimensional Euclidean space) onto a discrete grid: data are aggregated on each neuron (vector quantisation). Because the grid is discrete, the visualisation of gaps between clusters-if they exist-is uneasy. Various coloring methods have been proposed to account for this drawback, including. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] In particular, Kaski et al 14, 15 display neurons in a CIELab colorimetric space; 16 Johan Himberg 17 uses a hierarchical classification in order to find clusters and use a cut-off function in the resulting tree so as to linking neurons to a LUT (thanks to a method close to the Fuas' one). 5, 6 However, the SOM context differs from the one of our present objective, despite approaches that are connected. Indeed, we focus here on taxonomies and SOM deals with multidimensional data. Moreover, if hierarchical classifications are often involved in automatic coloration of SOM, the tree is not the input of the algorithm, but a step in the method (especially in the context of cluster discovering). Such methods can be considered, however, as sources of inspiration for the present paper.",

The \"bananaquit bird\" dataset offers a good illustration of that case (section 3.1). II. Edge lengths are unknown (the GenBank taxonomy dataset: section 3.2). We then have to (arbitrary) choose the length of edges. Many solutions can be considered. One may assign the same length for all edges. However, such a choice is inappropriate when the tree depth depends on the level of refinement along branches. Such a situation is rather common in taxonomy: the Eukaryote classification is actually more refined than that of Bacteria and Achea (Fig. 2 ). If the length of edges is set constant along the tree, humans appear closer to some bacteria (which are microscopic prokaryotes) than to octopus (which is also an animal). The toy example presented in Figure 3 , left insert (a) provides a good illustration of this bias.",

Indeed many phylogenies based on hierarchical classifications of signatures have been proposed.

However, because the number of items and the complexity of the dataset was somewhat low, Bellemain and co-authors succeeded in describe the relationships between taxonomy and geographical distribution in their publication (but at the price of more irksome work). When the size of the dataset and/or the complexity of their relationships increase, ColorPhylo can provide a critical benefit, as it can be observed for the second application. In that example, (genomic signature) colors express the membership of items to one of the three domains of life, with subtle shades showing subclasses.

For example, if the organisation of the data results from an analysis based on a distance matrix (such as the ones performed by Neighbor joining, 31 Fitch-Margoliash, 32 \u2026), the original distance matrix may be preferred to the taxonomic distance (such an approach may have been implemented for the bananaquit birds dataset).
