Of 139 episodes of wheezing, 58 (42 per cent) were associated with identifiable viral infections. There were 25 respiratory syncytial virus infections; wheezing occurred in 24 of these and pneumonia in 13 . Parainfluenza type 2 infection appeared to be next most likely to be associated with wheezing, followed by eoronavirus infection. Influenza A., (Hong Kong) was not associated with wheezing in any of the children. Infection with \"pathogenic\" bacteria was not statistically associated with wheezing. between infection of the respiratory tract and exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in individuals with intermittent reversible obstructive airway disease (asthma) is well established on clinical grounds. However, despite many studies it has not been possible to implicate acute bacterial infection in exacerbations of wheezing in asthmatic individuals. Even more uncertain is the role of bacterial allergy in the pathogenesis of asthma. ~-4 Recent studies using modern tissue culture technology have demonstrated that the majority of acute upper respiratory tract diseases in adults and of both upper and lower tract diseases in children is due to viruses. However, viral infections have not been systematically studied in asthmatic individuals, and published data attempting to relate such infection to acute wheezing attacks in asthmatic subjects are limited?",

This evidence is of two kinds. First, certain children, who were remarkably symptom free between acute attacks, developed clearly de- fined wheezing coincident with upper respiratory disease and viral infection (Fig. 3) . Second, infection with certain respiratory viruses was frequently associated with wheezing, whereas with other viruses the relationship was infrequent or not observed at all. For example, in all 17 instances where respiratory syncytial virus was recovered, and in 7 of 8 infections identified by serologic methods. acute wheezing occurred. This was in striking contrast to influenza A infection, where none of 11 infections was temporally associated with acute wheezing. Other viruses were intermediate in their capacity to cause obstructive symptoms. In these instances, individual children appeared to react differently to infection by the same virus.
