If the exposure time is less than 30 min, the risk may be low. The exposure time can increase the risk linearly. The number of passengers also increases the risk. However, R A is fairly insensitive to the number of passengers. Surgical masks are somewhat effective, whereas High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) masks are quite effective. Doubling the rate of ventilation reduces R A to almost 1.",

            "text": "Large-droplet and airborne transmissions may represent great risk for passengers in public vehicles during commute because of the high density and close proximity of passengers. Large-droplet transmission is considered a direct-contact transmission in which large droplets (>5 microns) contaminated by microorganisms are generated when an infected person sneezes, coughs or talks. These droplets are propelled over short distances (<1 m) and deposited on a susceptible host's mucosa. Airborne transmission involves the dissemination of tiny sus-pensions of droplet nuclei (residues of large microorganismcontaining droplets that have evaporated to <5 microns) that can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods, and be inhaled into the bronchioles of the recipient's respiratory tract. Common cold can spread predominantly by large-droplet transmission. Tuberculosis (TB) and smallpox may spread by airborne transmission. Infections such as influenza and measles can be spread by both transmissions, but are predominantly spread by airborne transmission. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is predominantly spread by large-droplet transmission, and airborne transmission (1) . The transmissions of these infectious diseases during commercial air travel have been reported (2, 3) . However, there is only one report on TB transmission during train commute, to the best of my knowledge (4) .",

The number of passengers occupying the vehicle train might become 1.5-2 times as many as the recommended capacity number. Aihara et al. (5) and Yasuda et al. (6) proposed that overcrowded passengers during train commute would affect the spread of pandemic influenza infection in Japan; however, the infection risks in a passenger car is unknown. Influenza viruses can be transmitted through aerosols, large droplets, or direct contact with secretions, these three modes of transmission are not mutually exclusive. From the experimental influenza infection with human volunteers, the 50% human infectious dose (HID 50 ) range was 0.6-3.0 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infective units), assuming a retention of 60% of inhaled particles. In contrast, the HID 50 range measured when inoculation was performed by administration of intranasal drops was 127-320 TCID 50 . This shows that the lower respiratory tract is the preferred site for the initiation of influenza infection (18) . Epidemiological observations consistent with the important role for aerosol transmission have been reported. One report was about mine workers traveling on a 75-seat aircraft for 3.5 h in 1999, and 15 passengers traveling with index case developed symptoms for 4 days. All the passengers were seated within 5 rows of the index case, and infection could have been transmitted by aerosol droplets to passengers behind the index patient (1). These results and recent review (18) indicate the importance of aerosol transmission in influenza.",

When the exposure time is less than 30 min for 150 passengers or less than 40 min for 50 passengers, the risk of secondary infection may be low. Exposure time can increase the risk linearly. The number of passengers also increases the risk, but R A is fairly insensitive to the number of passengers. When a train car is overcrowded with passengers, the risk of largedroplet transmission fairly increases. Surgical masks can protect against large-droplet transmission, but their effectiveness for airborne transmission is low compared with that of HEPA masks. Doubling the rate of ventilation reduces R A to almost 1. Because I assumed a homogeneous concentration of infectious aerosol over time and space in this study, the estimation of R A varies from the real R A due to actual environmental factors. However, the estimated results may provide useful information for investigating the effects of the control of infection, because there is insufficient data on the risk of influenza transmission in a train.",

            "text": "There are many reports on the transmission of infectious diseases during commercial air travel (2, 3), but there is only one report on such transmission during train and bus travels (4) . Three studies of influenza related to air travel have been reported (2) . Several studies of in-flight transmission of tuberculosis (TB) have been reported (2, 3, 19) . From the results of positive tuberculin skin test conversion cases revealing a probable link of onboard transmission, transmission within an aircraft cabin seems to be more likely under the condition of being close to a contagious passenger (within two rows) over a long time (greater than 8 h) and not as a result of the practice of recirculating 50% of cabin air (20) . An in-flight spread of SARS has also been reported, and airborne and small-droplet transmissions have been used to explain the distributions of SARS cases (2, 3) . Twenty-two of 120 passengers during a 3-h flight were identified as probable or laboratory-confirmed SARS after air travel. Because the affected passengers were seated seven rows in front and five rows behind the index passenger, airborne transmission rather than direct contact spread was considered as a possible explanations for this outbreak distribution (1). Moore et al. (4) reported on TB transmission during train and bus travel; in their study, 240 crews and passengers completed a tuberculin skin test (TST). Four people who were likely exposed in the dining car for less than 1 h had TST conversion. This transmission might have resulted from a brief proximal contact with an index case rather than from the extended sharing of airspace. Ko et al. (11) investigated the TB transmission risk in a commercial airline with a model that represents four compartments of an airline cabin based on the Wells-Riley model. They suggested that the risk and incidence of TB decrease sharply in cabins downstream of the cabin occupied by the source case, assuming some potential airflow from more contaminated to less contaminated cabins, and recognized that an increase in ventilation rate may reduce the risk. Rudnick and Milton (10) developed a non-steady-state version of the Wells-Riley model that did not assume such steady-state conditions under which quantum concentration and outdoor air supply rate remain constant with time using CO 2 concentration as a marker of exhaled-breath exposure. They estimated the relationships between R A and the number of occupants in a building environment for different mean CO 2 concentrations. They showed that a very high outdoor air supply rate may be effective in limiting the spread of influenza from the fact that R A = 1 if the CO 2 concentration is less than 100 ppm above the background (350 ppm). They also reported that the quantum generation rate q for rhinovirus 16 is 1-10/h, which is similar to the q for pulmonary TB; the q for measles was 570/h. Liao et al. (12) applied the non-steady-state version of the Wells-Riley model to estimate the baseline risk of the outbreak of influenza in a commercial airline, and as well as the baseline risk of the outbreak of SARS in a hospital and an elementary school. They estimated the probability distribution of quantum generation rate for SARS, and a log-normal distribution with a geometric mean of 28.77 and a geometric standard deviation of 2.64 was fitted to such a distribution.",
