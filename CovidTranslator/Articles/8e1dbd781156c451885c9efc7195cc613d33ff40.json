Although Salmonella enterica has been associated with urinary tract lesions in man, information on urocystitis/ ureteritis in cattle caused by salmonellae is lacking. This communication describes lesions of the inferior urinary tract in four Holstein calves with septicaemia caused by S. enterica subsp. enterica serotype Dublin. Examination of the urinary bladder revealed either diffuse irregular thickening (three cases) or petechiation (one case) of the mucosa. On histopathological examination, urocystitis with submucosal histiocytic, lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltration and neutrophil transmigration through the urothelium was noted in all cases. In one case, a fibrinosuppurative ureteritis was detected. Salmonella Dublin was identified by culture, 16S rDNA sequencing and serotyping and Salmonella antigen was detected intralesionally by immunohistochemistry. Other lesions, indicative of septicaemia included hepatitis, enteritis, pericarditis, splenitis, lymphadenitis and pneumonia. We conclude that S. Dublin can be uropathogenic in cattle with septicaemia.",

Typhimurium is generally associated with enteritis and diarrhoea in calves, S. Dublin is more often associated with systemic infections that can result in death after a peracute clinical course or acute disease with fever, respiratory signs, arthritis or abortion in pregnant cows.

The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse Ig polymer dextran conjugate labelled with horseradish peroxidase (Dako EnVision + System, HRP, Dako; catalogue number K4001) applied for 30 min at RT and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Dako AEC substrate chromogen, Dako; catalogue number K3469) applied for 15 min at RT was used as the chromogen. Slides were then counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin (SigmaeAldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA; catalogue number MHS32) for 5 min at RT and coverslipped. Tissues from cases 1 and 2 were also subjected to IHC for identification of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, IBRV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). Tissues from case 2 were also subjected to IHC for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCoV). All IHC was performed following validated standard operating procedures at the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, using appropriate positive and negative controls for each technique. Specifically for the Salmonella IHC, the positive control consisted of colon from a horse infected with S. Typhimurium.",

An aetiological diagnosis of S. Dublin septicaemia was based on bacterial cultures, 16S rDNA sequencing and serotyping in all cases. Additionally, the IHC for Salmonella antigen detection was a useful tool to demonstrate the bacterium intralesionally in the urinary bladder, kidneys and/or intestines of two of the three cases analyzed by this technique. Although tubulointerstitial nephritis is described occasionally as part of the spectrum of lesions in septicaemia caused by S. Dublin in cattle, lower urinary tract lesions have not been described in this species, therefore, this report broadens the spectrum of urinary lesions in this condition. Salmonella Dublin has been associated previously with pyelonephritis secondary to unilateral hydronephrosis in a Holstein calf (Taghipur Bazargani et al., 2015) . In the cases presented herein, these lesions were ruled out, although there was fibrinosuppurative ureteritis in one of the calves.",

It has been associated with old age, concomitant diseases such as diabetes mellitus, urolithiasis, urinary tract malformations, chronic disease or immunosuppressive therapy (Tena et al., 2007) . Salmonella Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium are the serotypes most frequently isolated from people with UTI (Tena et al., 2007) , although other non-typhoidal salmonellas and Salmonella Typhi have been implicated in cases of haemorrhagic cystitis (Na et al., 2013; Polat et al., 2014) . Because people act as reservoirs only for S. Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, the occurrence of disease associated with non-typhoidal salmonellas suggests acquisition either from animal reservoirs or from contaminated animal products or foods (Na et al., 2013) , so non-typhoidal salmonellosis is of great public health importance. Cattle are a host-adapted species for S. Dublin and are considered a good experimental model for non-typhoidal salmonellosis in man (Costa et al., 2012) . Salmonella Dublin also causes invasive infections in man (Yim et al., 2014) .",

However, bacteria that have specific virulence factors for adhesion to the urothelium may colonize the urinary tract mucosa and elicit a local inflammatory response. Most commonly, UTI in cattle results from ascending infection, but it can also occur through the descending or haematogenous routes. Ascending infections result from bacteria lodged in the urethra, the origin of which is almost always the rectal microbiota (Cianciolo and Mohr, 2016) . In the cases described in this report, disseminated renal and multisystemic lesions suggested that urocystitis and ureteritis may have occurred through descending infections resulting from haematogenous dissemination of S. Dublin to the kidneys; however, ascending infection by salmonellae shed through the faeces cannot be ruled out, particularly in heifers.",

A recent paper describing the spectrum of lesions induced by S. Dublin in <6-monthold Holstein calves in the USA, indicates that inflammatory lesions are frequently found in the lungs (>90% of cases), liver (90% of cases), lymph nodes (62% of cases) and spleen (50% of cases) (Pecoraro et al., 2017) . Our results suggest that S. Dublin is also capable of causing urocystitis and ureteritis in calves and that the strains involved might have virulence factors that determine uropathogenicity. More extensive molecular and phenotypical studies on Salmonella strains isolated from cases of UTI may help understand the mechanisms associated with uropathogenicity of different Salmonella serotypes. with photomicrographs.
