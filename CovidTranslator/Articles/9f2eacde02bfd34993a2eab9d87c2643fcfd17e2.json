            "text": "With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be controlled for prolonged periods, [1] although the virus cannot be eliminated [2] and treatment failures occur due to development of drug-resistant mutations. [3] Chronic immune hyperactivation and raised T-cell turnover due to continued viral replication and antigenic stimulation are present even after HAART has decreased the viral load to undetectable levels. [4] Both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines are produced during chronic immune stimulation. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), contribute to tissue pathology, especially in the brain, [5] and can induce transcription of latent HIV-1.[6,7] Type 2 or regulatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, can suppress type 1 cytokines and induce polyclonal B-cell activation, [8] lymphomagenesis, [9] autoantibody production, [10] and manifestations of allergy. [11] Type 1 cytokines, such as IL-12, interferon (IFN) gamma, and IL-2, are important for antiviral cell-mediated immunity. [12] During the long course of HIV-1 infection, type 2 cytokines gradually come to predominate over type 1 cytokines, [13] [14] [15] [16] although this finding is not universally accepted. [17] There have been few studies of in vitro cytokine production in neonatally acquired HIV-1 infection in Asian or Chinese children. The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELIS-POT) system for measuring unstimulated or mitogen-activated cytokine secreting cells has not been evaluated in this context. We wished to know whether monitoring cytokine production in addition to CD4+ cell counts and viral load could provide additional useful information in pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection being treated with HAART. We hoped to identify cytokine profiles that are characteristic of either clinical improvement or disease progression, so that manipulation towards the desirable profile might be attempted.",

Clinical findings in 8 of the patients have been described previously. [18] Ten Asian and 2 Eurasian children, 4 girls and 8 boys, were infected by mother-to-child-transmission of HIV-1. They were initially diagnosed between 1996 and 2002 at age 364 (median, 32) months and they have been followed for 961 (median, 44) months (Table) . At the time of diagnosis, 9 children had low CD4+ cell counts (compared with the age-specific normal range [19] ) and the median plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 500,000 copies/mL (110,0001,300,000). All children had lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly at diagnosis. One girl (patient 3) developed NKT-cell lymphoma which caused her death, the only fatality during the study period. Most of the patients had infectious complications, including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (1), viral pneumonia (1), disseminated Penicillium marneffei (1), thrush (4), tinea capitis (1), and herpes simplex (1) . Other complications included neutropenia in 1 patient, hepatitis and anemia in 1, and asthma and/or rhinitis in 3. Patients were started on HAART immediately after confirmation of HIV-1 infection and were treated with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (zidovudine, lamivudine, didanosine, stavudine, and/or abacavir) plus 1 protease inhibitor (indinavir, nelfinavir, Kaletra (lopinavir + ritonavir), ritonavir, or amprenavir) or the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine. Details are given in the Table. Patients were examined and blood for hematologic, virologic, and immunologic evaluation was taken every 26 months. The first cytokine evaluation was performed within 1 month of starting HAART in 7 patients, within 24 months in 3 patients, and after 16 and 19 months in 2 patients.",
