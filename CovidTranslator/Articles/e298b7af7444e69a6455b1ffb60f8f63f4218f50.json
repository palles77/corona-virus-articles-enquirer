At this early stage, we do not have specific data about susceptibility to the virus, but we have data on infectious complications for biologic therapies from their pivotal trials for psoriasis. In table 1 we compare overall infection rates as well as upper respiratory infections and nasopharyngitis for each drug to its placebo control based on published data from pivotal trials.For TNF blockers, during the placebo-controlled periods overall infections and upper respiratory infections are increased by up to 7% compared to placebo, except for etanercept, which showed no increase. TNF blockers carry a black box warning concerning infection. Ustekinumab showed a small increase in overall infections but not in respiratory tract infections. Ustekinumab blocks IL-12 and IL-23; and IL-12 plays an important role in fighting viral infections. 1 IL-23 blockers showed increases in overallinfections up to 9%, but upper respiratory infections were increased slightly in some trials, but not in others. IL-17 blockers showed increases in overall infections by up to 11%, but much of that increase could be accounted for by increases in monilial infections. Upper respiratory infections were increased by small amounts for secukinumab, but not for ixekizumab or brodalumab.",
