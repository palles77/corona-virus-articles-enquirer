Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays reportedly have greater sensitivity than conventional viral assays, 4, 5 leading to an increased viral detection rate 4, 6, 7 . PCR has been used to provide detailed molecular identification of adenovirus in previous epidemiologic studies 8, 9 . The prolonged presence of adenovirus nucleic acid (NA) in respiratory secretions following upper respiratory tract infection (URI) has not been studied, but prolonged adenovirus shedding has been described 10 . Adenovirus has been isolated from 6% of rectal samples and 0.6-3%of throat samples from healthy children [11] [12] [13] . In addition, adenovirus NA has been found in tonsil and adenoid tissue of young children undergoing routine tonsillectomy 14 . These studies suggest that, following initial infection, adenovirus NA can persist in the respiratory tract and be shed intermittently. Careful phylogenetic studies have not been performed to elucidate whether this phenomenon is caused by persistent infection with one adenovirus strain or caused by subsequent infections with different adenovirus strains.",

Children were seen by a study physician as soon as possible after URI onset, with a follow-up visit occurring 3-7 days later.

Sequence chromatograms were analyzed using the Staden package (preGap4 and Gap4) 19 and the Seqman II program of DNAstar's Lasergene 6.0 package (DNAstar, Madison, WI). Chromatograms were manually verified and corrected when there were obvious inaccuracies. Adenovirus serotyping was performed using the \"nucleotide BLAST\" feature available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information's website. Following BLAST analysis, the sample was assigned a serotype based on that of the sequence showing the greatest homology to the sample (e.g. serotype 1, 2, 3, 4, etc; consistent with international adenovirus classification system).",

We did not collect NPS samples from asymptomatic children; neither did we collect NPS on a regular basis. The samples were collected at the new URI onset and when the children subsequently developed AOM. The original study design did not include serologic studies, which would have required acute and convalescent blood drawings. Simultaneous adenovirus-specific serology may have helped with interpretation of repeated adenovirus NA detected. Even with the limitations mentioned here, our data clearly demonstrate various patterns of adenovirus infection and strongly suggest the possibility of prolonged presence of viral NAs after respiratory tract infection.",

For adenovirus, repeated or prolonged presence of viral NA's may be due to the same strain with continuous or intermittent detection, or different serotypes/strains during symptomatic URI. Because positive PCR for adenovirus without phylogenetic analysis is subject to various interpretations, caution should be employed in clinical interpretation of the results obtained. Future longitudinal studies documenting the ability to detect viral NA during symptomatic and asymptomatic periods, as well as implementing quantitative PCR, might help elucidate the role of positive PCR results during respiratory tract infections.
