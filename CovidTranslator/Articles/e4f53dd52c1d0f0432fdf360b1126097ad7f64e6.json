Majority of these viruses have not been isolated and there is little information regarding their biology in bats. Establishing a well-characterized bat cell line supporting the replication of bat-borne viruses would facilitate the analysis of virus-host interactions in an in vitro model. Currently, few bat cell lines have been developed and only Tb1-Lu, derived from Tadarida brasiliensis is commercially available. Here we describe a method to establish and immortalize big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) kidney (Efk3) cells using the Myotis polyomavirus T-antigen. Subclones of this cell line expressed both epithelial and fibroblast markers to varying extents. Cell clones expressed interferon beta in response to poly(I:C) stimulation and supported the replication of four different viruses, namely, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PED-CoV), Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). To our knowledge, this is the first bat cell line from a northern latitude insectivorous bat developed using a novel technology. The cell line has the potential to be used for isolation of bat viruses and for studying virus-bat interactions in culture.",

Currently a single bat cell line (Tb1-Lu, ATCC number CCL-88, derived from the lung of Tadarida brasiliensis) is available through the American Type Culture Collection.

American Big brown bat) using the Myotis polyomavirus T antigen (MyPVTag). We characterized the capacity of MyPVTag to enhance DNA replication in Vero cells and found that it significantly increased their DNA content. We then transfected MyPVTag into primary bat kidney cells and sub-cloned several cell lines. We characterized the lineage of these clones and tested their expression of the interferon beta (IFN beta) gene in response to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) stimulation. We further tested three cloned kidney cell lines for their ability to support the replication of viruses from the families Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae and Rhabdoviridae. The parental cell line and clones were capable of expressing IFN beta and supported the replication of viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; family Rhabdoviridae, genus Vesiculovirus), herpes simplex virus (HSV; family Herpesviridae, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, genus Herpesvirus), PED-CoV and MERS-CoV. PED-CoV and MERS-CoV are viruses for which transmission from bats, either directly or via an intermediate reservoir, has resulted in high mortality in pigs (Lee, 2015) and humans (Coleman and Frieman, 2014) , respectively. VSV and HSV are members of viral families that have previously been detected in bat species [reviewed in (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015) ]. Although E. fuscus primary embryonic cells have been described before (Qian et al., 2013) , to our knowledge, this is the first cell line established from a northern latitude insectivorous bat that was transformed by using a viral element (MyPVTag) selected from a known bat virus. Furthermore, the established kidney cell lines were able to support the replication of selected viruses from three different virus families.",

For IFN beta quantification, qPCR assays targeting the IFN beta transcripts and the normalizer (GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde-3phosphate) were performed for the clones. Stratagene's MX3005P PCR (Stratagene, USA) cycler was used in conjunction with Quantifast SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN).

Three housekeeping genes were tested (GAPDH, beta-actin and beta-2microglobulin) and none showed variation between treated and mock treated samples. Thus GAPDH was used for normalizing the data.

For VSV inoculations, WST 50 concentration of the virus was used to infect the cells, which were seeded in 12 well plates at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well. WST 50 was determined as that dilution of virus that produced 50% cell death as measured using the WST-1 assay. WST-1 assay is similar to the MTT assay (Heldt et al., 2006) . Briefly, cells were seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 4 /well and analyzed with the WST assay at the indicated time points. 10 l WST-1 reagent (Roche, USA) was added to each well and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h.

To determine if the Myotis polyomavirus T-ag shared the ability of its SV40 homologue to induce DNA replication, we transfected Vero cells with plasmids encoding genes for the two T-antigens. We then confirmed that cells expressed T antigen by immunostaining and compared the DNA content of T antigen expressing cells with cells transfected with the pcDNA null plasmid. Fig. 1 shows cells expressing Myotis polyomavirus and SV40T antigen contained more DNA Vero cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either SV40Tag, MyPVTag or empty vector (pcDNA). Twenty-four hr after transfection, cells were immunestained for cytoplasmic T-antigen and with propidium iodide to quantify DNA. The DNA content of T-antigen and pcDNA transfected cells was determined by flow cytometry and expressed as the fold increase in DNA content relative to pcDNA transfected cells. The ratio for cells transfected with pcDNA was taken as '1 . Experiments were done in triplicate and mean values plotted. Error bars represent standard deviation. Statistical difference was calculated using Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples. * < 0.05. than cells transfected with pcDNA plasmid. SV40Tag expressing Vero cells showed the highest increase in DNA content.",

SV40 T-ag is known to enhance DNA content in cells (Ohkubo et al., 1994; Ahuja et al., 2005) and interestingly the bat polyomavirus Tantigen shared similar properties. Myotis polyomavirus belongs to the same family as SV40. Large T-ags from both these viruses were transfected to immortalize the E. fuscus kidney cells, but only cells expressing MyPVTag gave rise to stable cell lines. We do not know why SV40Tag failed to immortalize bat cells.

Interferon response in terms of interferon beta transcript upregulation by bat cell lines, mostly cell lines from fruit bats, has been demonstrated before (Hagmaier et al., 2007; Crameri et al., 2009; Biesold et al., 2011; Virtue et al., 2011) .

The clones responded to poly(I:C), as we observed a several thousand-fold increase in interferon beta transcript when compared to mock treated cells. Immortalization of cells is sometimes known to compromise the ability of the cells to transcribe the interferon beta gene (Biesold et al., 2011) .

Further work can be done to identify receptors specific to these viruses. VSV, HSV, PED-CoV and MERS-CoV grew to varying levels in the Efk clones. Clone 2F did not exhibit any visual cytopathology on infection with PED-CoV although virus replication was detected by qRT-PCR. This could be due to a lower level of virus replication in 2F (Fig. 4D ) as the images (Fig. 3) were taken 48 h post-infection. At this point we do not know if 2F mounts a more robust interferon response or if it lacks other factors required for PED-CoV replication during the initial 48 h post-infection.",

Furthermore, this cell line supported the replication of viruses from three virus families known to be harbored by bats. Not much is known about innate immune responses in bats and how they are activated during viral infections. Establishing well-characterized cell lines from relevant bat reservoir species is the first step in addressing the many questions that researchers have about innate immunity in bats Moratelli and Calisher 2015) . This cell line will help us better understand the bat innate responses and how they may contribute to the absence of overt disease symptoms when bats are infected with these viruses.",
