The two pollutants' emissions were decomposed into output effects, structural effects, clean production effects, and pollution abatement effects. The results showed that China's industrial SO 2 discharge increased by 1.14 Mt during 2003-2014, and the contributions from the four effects were 23.17, \u2212 1.88, \u2212 3.80, and \u2212 16.36 Mt, respectively. Likewise, NO x discharge changed by \u2212 3.44 Mt over 2011-2014, and the corresponding contributions from the four effects were 2.97, \u2212 0.62, \u2212 1.84, and \u2212 3.95 Mt. Thus, the output effect was mainly responsible for the growth of the two discharges. The average annual contribution rates of SO 2 and NO x from output were 14.33 and 5.97%, respectively, but pollution abatement technology presented the most obvious mitigating effects (\u2212 10.11 and \u2212 7.92%), followed by the mitigating effects of clean production technology (\u2212 2.35 and \u2212 3.7%), and the mitigation from the structural effect was the weakest (\u2212 1.16 and \u2212 1.25%, respectively), which meant pollutant reduction policies related to industrial structure adjustment should be a long-term measure for the two discharges. In addition, the sub-sectors of I20 (manufacture of raw chemical materials and chemical products), I24 (manufacture of non-metallic mineral products), and I26 (smelting and pressing of non-ferrous metals) were the major contributors to both discharges. Thus, these sub-sectors should be given priority consideration when designing mitigation-related measures. Last, some particular policy implications were recommended for reducing the two discharges, including that the government should seek a technological discharge reduction route.",

Decreasing the discharge of these two air pollutants has an important significance for a cleaner atmosphere and environment and improved public (Xie et al. 2004; Blanchard et al. 2005; Muller et al. 2009; de Gouw et al. 2014) . In fact, scientists have analyzed their trends and source characteristics, expecting to discover some physical methods or policy tools to remove the pollutants (Popp 2006; Fraley et al. 2006; Washenfelder et al. 2010; Fang et al. 2011; Hansjurgens 2011; Lu et al. 2013; Pinkerton 2014; Lee and Zhou 2015; Jacimovski et al. 2016) . For example, Mekaroonreung and Johnson (2012) used the stochastic semi-non-parametric envelopment method to estimate the shadow prices of SO 2 and NO x generated by US coal power plants. They proposed a price mechanism to inhibit the two pollutants' emissions. Sun et al. (2016) provided a detailed description of SO 2 and NO x resources and summarized the currently used techniques to remove them in order to protect the atmospheric environment. In addition, by introducing new energy such as solar, wind, and fuel cells, controlling air pollutants had been discussed and programmed by some optimization models to satisfy the atmosphere quality demands in a cost-effective manner (Chen et al. 2016 Li et al. 2017; He et al. 2017) . Thus, it is currently necessary to study this problem in depth from some other perspectives.",

            "text": "China's gross domestic product (GDP) has experienced rapid growth since 1978 that has made it the fastest growing country (Zhang and Wen 2008) . Similarly, its industrial GDP also showed a remarkable growth. In 2003, the Chinese industrial GDP was valued at 7.47 trillion Chinese yuan (CNY), but it increased to 22.34 trillion CNY in 2014 with an annual average increase of 10.47%. The smallest increase was 6.93% in 2014 (Fig. 1a) . This rapid economic development coupled with industrialization, urbanization, and inadequate investments in basic air treatment infrastructure resulted in widespread atmospheric pollution in China (Lei et al. 2012 ). Therefore, more attention has been paid to whether the country's development is sustainable and when and how its environmental conditions will be improved. For example, it was projected that China's government should reduce SO 2 and NO x emissions by an annual decreasing rate of 8 and 10%, respectively, while retaining an average annual GDP growth rate of no less than 7% during its 12th Five-Year Plan (2011 -2015 . As a result, the real mitigating effects (18 and 18.6% for SO 2 and NO x , respectively) and the GDP growth (7.8%) were reported in the first chapter of China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016 -2020 Xinhua News Agency 2016) . The discharges of the two pollutants decreased from 2011 to 2014, and the corresponding discharge intensities (discharge per GDP) also obviously decreased from 2011 to 2014 (Fig. 1b) . Traditionally, with the development of economy, it was considered that the pollutants' discharge would show an inverted-U shape trend (Grossman and Krueger 1991) . However, this was not the sole possible relationship between economic development and pollutant discharges (Douglas and Thomas 1995; Friedl and Getzner 2003) , as seen in the abrupt increase of SO 2 from 2010 to 2011 (Fig. 1b) . Thus, some other methods and/or new perspectives are needed to study this problem in China.",

            "text": "There are two commonly used methods in the similar studies Xiao et al. 2016) : structural decomposition analysis (SDA) and index decomposition analysis (IDA). SDA often requires the economic data of an input-output table, while IDA only needs the aggregate data of each industrial category (Cellura et al. 2012; Cansino et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2016 ). In addition, SDA can only analyze the change between the limited years, while IDA usually can analyze the change across any years (Hoekstra and van der Bergh 2003) . Therefore, based on the available data, the IDA model was adopted for this study, despite the fact that there are still many optional indices for quantifying the impacts of factorial changes on the aggregated industrial sector. These indices include the Laspeyres index (Lu et al., 2014a, b) , the Paasche index , the arithmetic mean Divisia index (Hatzigeorgiou et al. 2008) , and the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI; Ang 2005; Wang et al. 2005; Lee and Oh 2006; Wood and Lenzen 2006) . Among them, the LMDI has become the most popular due to its incomparable advantages (Chen 2011; Tan et al. 2011; Ren et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013; Tian et al., 2013a, b; Shao et al. 2016) . Therefore, the LMDI decomposition was chosen for this study. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the LMDI decomposition model and the corresponding data explanation are presented in the BData and methodology^section, the results and related discussions are presented in the BResults and discussion^section, and some conclusions and particular strategies or policy implications for mitigating Chinese SO 2 and NO x discharges (especially in the industrial sector) are contained in the BConclusions and policy implications\u015d ection. (Table 1) . It is worth noting that the national statistics are revised when an economic census is completed, and the revisions will be published in the next year. Moreover, in order to eliminate the influence of price changes on the raw economic data, they are deflated from the current prices to constant 2010 prices using the corresponding price indices. Since the price indices are not available at the industrial sub-sector level, the price indices of the entire industrial sector are used to replace them.",

It is decomposed as the economic output effect (G), the industrial structure effect (S), and the intensity effect (I). I can somewhat reflect the technological level's progress (Sun 1998 ) and can be further divided into the effects of cleaner production (C) and pollution abatement (A). C is the production of the two pollutants per unit of GDP, and A is the ratio of the pollutant's discharge divided by the production's amount. Therefore, C and A can somewhat reflect the developmental status of cleaner production technologies (CPTs) and pollution abatement technologies (PATs), respectively. The CPT focuses on the management of these pollutants' sources and the reuse of resources during the process of production, whereas PAT only focuses on the pollution end-controlling.",

The end of the 10th Five-Year Plan (2003) (2004) (2005) was sorted as the first stage. Therefore, SO 2 changes were in three continuous stages, and NO x was only in one stage. The multiplicative decomposition results of these various stages are presented in Figure S1 . The corresponding additive decomposition results are listed in Fig. 2 (Table S1) Tables S2  and S3 ). However, China's SO 2 emissions still experienced an overall increase ( Fig. 1b ) of 1.14 Mt or 8% (Tables S2  and S3) . Similarly, China's NO x decreased by 3.44 Mt from 2011 to 2014 (Figs. 1b and 3; Table S2 ), with a change rate of \u2212 21% (Table S1) . Table 3 shows the contributions of various factors to the two pollutants' changes, which were calculated through the additive results in Table S2 . Here, the contributions refer to the proportions of pollutant changes caused by each factor at time T (i.e., the additive decomposition result of each factor) in the total EICE at time 0. Contributions were ordered from high to low during 2003-2014 as follows: the mitigating factors of the SO 2 discharge in China were the pollution abatement effect (\u2212 111.24%), the clean production effect (\u2212 25.87%), and the industrial structure (\u2212 12.78%), while the promotion factor was only output (157.62%). The promotion effect (157.62%) was still much greater than the total mitigating effects (\u2212 111.24% \u2212 25.87% \u2212 12.78% = \u2212 149.89%), which caused a slight increase of 7.72% in the total SO 2 discharge from 2003 to 2014 (Table 3) . Similarly, the mitigating factors of the NO x discharge were the pollution abatement effect (\u2212 23.77%), the clean production effect (\u2212 11.10%), and the industrial structure (\u2212 3.75%), while the promotion factor was also only output (17.90%). Conversely, the promotion effect (17.90%) was l e s s t h a n t h e t o t a l m i t i g a t i n g e f f e c t s ( \u2212 23.77% \u2212 11.10% \u2212 3.75% = \u2212 38.62%). Thus, this fact caused an obvious decrease of 20.72% in the total NO x discharge during 2011-2014 (Table 3) .",

Moreover, the transformation of the industrial structure received great impetus as a result of some Indices' trends of cumulative decomposition results of SO 2 and NO x changes. \u03a8Y tot , \u03a8Y A , \u03a8Y C , \u03a8Y S , and \u03a8Y G denoted the total change and the effects' indices of pollution abatement, clean production, structure, and output on the two discharges, respectively effective pollution reduction actions of the government. As a result, the proportion of tertiary industry output increased from 42.9% in 2008 to 48.1% in 2014. Therefore, it could be found that these pollutant reduction efforts (such as updating the industrial structure) surely had a positive effect on mitigating the two pollutants' discharges. For example, the industrial structure adjustment presented an overall mitigating effect on SO 2 discharge from 2003 to 2014 when the average annual contribution rate was \u2212 1.16% (Table 4 ). In the various three stages, the corresponding average annual contribution rates were 0.04, \u2212 2.17, and \u2212 1.24% (Table 4 ). These results indicated that although the industrial structure adjustment in China was not obvious (Fig. 4) and was a driving effect in stage 1 ( -2005 ), it was ultimately effective for mitigating SO 2 discharge. This adjustment concept indicated that production resources were reallocated among industrial sectors with different technologies, efficiencies, and profits, thus inducing the changes of output share among different sectors. It was an important source of sustainable growth and a radical approach to transform the developmental pattern (Ren et al. 2012) . Thus, with the implementation of the three continuous Five-Year Plans, China's industrial structure gradually transformed from manufacturing industries with heavy pollutant discharges to a new phase with a more reasonable industrial structure. In this new phase, high-tech industries with high added values and low pollutant discharges (such as photovoltaic, electronic, solar, and information industries) rapidly developed. Therefore, the output share of the low discharge group started to continuously increase while that of the high discharge group symmetrically began to decrease from 2011 to 2014. The share of the former rose up from 30.25% in 2011 to 31.90% in 2014, with an annual average increase rate of approximately 0.55% (Fig. 5) .",

Similarly, the mitigating impact on the NO x discharge was 34.87% from 2011 to 2014. All the mitigating impacts of the intensity effects were stronger than the structure effects for both SO 2 and NO x . These results indicated that the reductions of China's SO 2 and NO x discharges mainly depended on the intensity effect since it was the overall reflection of technological improvement under the guidelines of various environment laws, regulations, tax policies, and other measures. Taking the investment in pollution control as an example, the intensity effect manifested technological progress' effectiveness of the total government investments used to reduce pollutant discharges (Lei et al. 2012 ). The intensity effect was equal to the pollution abatement effect added by the clean production effect (\u0394Y I = \u0394Y A + \u0394Y C ). Thus, they can be separately analyzed. In most years (except for 2004-2005) , the pollution abatement effect had the dominant mitigation impacts on SO 2 and NO x discharges (Table 3) . For stages 1, 2, and 3, the corresponding decomposition results of the pollution abatement effect on SO 2 discharge were 0.23, \u2212 14.60, and \u2212 5.08 Mt (Fig. 2) , with the average annual change rates of 0.79, \u2212 14.95, and \u2212 7.51% (Table 4) , respectively. This result was consistent with Figs. 2, 4, and 5. During 2003-2014, the average annual contribution rate of the pollution abatement effect on mitigating SO 2 discharge was the largest (\u2212 10.11%) among the four effects (output, structure, clean production, and pollutant abatement effects, Table 4 ). Similarly, from 2011 to 2014, the decomposition result of the pollution abatement effect on NO x discharge was \u2212 3.95 Mt (Fig. 2) , with an average annual contribution rate of \u2212 7.92% (Table 4 ). This was also consistent with Figs. 2 and 4. The average annual contribution rate was also the largest among the four effects.

Moreover, the pollutant treatment technology and the other two factors have also been recently investigated as the potential drivers of single SO 2 emissions in China from 1995 to 2014 using the LMDI method ). In addition, taking Jiangsu Province as a case, Wang et al. (2017) also used this method to conduct the decomposition and analysis of single SO 2 emissions from the perspective of the whole pollutant treatment process. These studies can somewhat prove the reliability of this LMDI method and the credibility of the results of this paper. However, all these studies that have been mentioned have not simultaneously investigated the potential driving forces of the two discharges (SO 2 and NO x ) from the perspectives of both the Five-Year Plan and industrial structure. Thus, taking China as a case in this paper, we first completed this work, using the LMDI method. Therefore, this work reflected the innovation significance of this article.",

Moreover, the discharges of SO 2 or NO x may be mainly distributed in Eastern China (i.e., in the Jingjinji Region (which is made up of Beijing City, Tianjin City, and Hebei Province) because of the more developed economic level in these regions. Therefore, the decomposition analysis of the entirety of China ignores the gap from the different regions. All of these facts mentioned above may induce some errors in the results.

However, few scientists had investigated the potential driving forces of these two discharges from the perspectives of both the Five-Year Plan period and industrial structure. Thus, taking China as a case in this paper, we completed this work through a decomposition analysis using the LMDI method. The two pollutants' discharges were decomposed into the output effect, structural effect, clean production effect, and pollution abatement effect. The results showed that China's industrial SO 2 discharge increased to 1.14 Mt from 2003 to 2014. The contributions by the four effects were 23.17, \u2212 1.88, \u2212 3.80, and \u2212 16.36 Mt, respectively. Likewise, NO x discharge increased to \u2212 3.44 Mt from 2011 to 2014, and the corresponding contributions by the four effects were 2.97, \u2212 0.62, \u2212 1.84, and \u2212 3.95 Mt. Thus, the output effect (industrial output growth) was always the most prominent driving force for the growth of the two discharges due to rapid industrialization and urbanization in recent years. The average annual contribution rates were 14.33 and 5.97%. Inversely, pollution abatement technology presented the most obvious mitigating effects (\u2212 10.11 and \u2212 7.92%, respectively). Next were the mitigating effects of clean production technology (\u2212 2.35 and \u2212 3.7%). The mitigation of the structural effect was the weakest (\u2212 1.16 and \u2212 1.25%).",
