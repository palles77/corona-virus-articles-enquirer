Decisions about the initiation and timing of invasive ventilation can be difficult and early discussion with critical care colleagues is essential. Appropriateness of invasive ventilatory support may also be an issue requiring advanced discussion with patients and their families. In the past 10e15 years, the role of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has expanded, not least in an attempt to minimize the complications inherent with invasive ventilation. As such, NIV is now considered first-line therapy in some conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary oedema, mild-to-moderate hypoxaemic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients), and a 'trial of NIV' is often considered in respiratory failure resulting from an increasingly wide range of causes. When using NIV, the importance of the environment (setting, monitoring and experience of staff ) and forward planning cannot be overemphasized. When used for other than the standard indications, NIV should be employed in a high-dependency/intensive care setting only in patients for whom invasive ventilation would be considered.",

NIV can be delivered using most modern 'intensive care' ventilators. For sicker patients this has several advantages (ability to deliver higher and precise concentrations of oxygen; separate inspiratory/expiratory limbs minimizing re-breathing of CO 2 ; better monitoring/alarm features; and rapid access to invasive ventilation). Outside of the ICU, NIV is commonly applied using smaller, 'simpler' but increasingly sophisticated 'non-invasive' ventilators, which can provide a range of respiratory support modes. Pressure-cycled modes are generally preferred (accommodation of leaks), and breaths can be either patient-triggered (pressure support or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP)), or initiated and controlled by the ventilator (pressure control). Indeed, both modes are often used synergistically to provide back up when triggering is poor or if patient respiratory rate is unreliable, and to cover potential apnoeic episodes.",

Appropriateness of ventilatory support may also be an issue requiring advanced discussion with patients and families. Once a decision to intubate has been made, the transition from an awake and self-ventilating patient to controlled invasive ventilation can be very difficult in the critically ill. Most patients will have evidence of developing or established organ dysfunction, particularly cardiovascular dysfunction (ischaemic heart disease, sepsis), and commonly such patients are hypovolaemic. Both anaesthetic induction agents and positive pressure ventilation (which decreases venous return) produce cardiovascular depression and peri-intubation hypotension is common. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation can lead to very rapid desaturation in such patients, due to their marginal respiratory reserve and circulatory problems. Such consequences need to be anticipated: large-volume cannulae should be in place; access to plasma expanders and inotropes should be immediately available; and following induction of anaesthesia the airway must be rapidly secured by an experienced member of the critical care team e ideally in an appropriately equipped area of the hospital. Descriptions of individual ventilatory strategies are beyond the scope of this chapter. However, over the past 10e20 years there has been increasing recognition that invasive ventilation, although lifesaving, can be associated with significant complications, such as nosocomial pneumonia, critical illness neuromyopathy syndromes and barotrauma (pneumothoraces); and ventilation itself may be associated with propagation of underlying lung injury and subsequent worsening of multi-organ failure. 31, 32 The landmark NIH ARDS network trial 33 confirmed that in patients with acute lung injury, the use of a reduced tidal volume (6 ml/kg) and avoidance of high airway pressures (<30 cmH 2 O) were associated with improved mortality (31% vs. 39.8% (NNTz11)) when compared with a conventional ventilatory approach.

In the recent CESAR study, 39 transfer to a centre capable of delivering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was associated with improved outcome (death or disability) at 6 months. This study and the high-profile success of ECMO in the H1N1 40 influenza pandemic has resulted in a resurgence of interest in this technique. Simpler forms of extracorporeal support exist where hypercapnia is the predominant problem. 41 The development of these and other specialist techniques, along with a recognized volumeeoutcome relationship for mechanical ventilation, 42 has promoted the concept of advanced respiratory support centres to manage the sickest patients.",
