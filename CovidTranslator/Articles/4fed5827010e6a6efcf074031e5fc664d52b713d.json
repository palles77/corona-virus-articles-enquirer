            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemics is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and 28 healthcare systems worldwide. Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit 29 (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients 30 with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised 31 subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general. 32 ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for 33 malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in 34 chronic and acute disease. Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required 35 for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause 36 malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, 37 poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of 38 malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients. 39 In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) 40 aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by 41 proposing 10 practical recommendations. The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU 42 setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated 43 with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival. The breaking of a COVID-19 pandemic is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to 48 patients and healthcare systems worldwide (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . The disease primarily involves the respiratory 49 tract (1-5) but it may deteriorate to multi-organ failure and be fatal (3). Acute respiratory 50 complications that are reported to require prolonged ICU stays are a major cause of morbidity 51 and mortality in COVID-19 patients, and older adults and polymorbid individuals have worst 52 outcomes and higher mortality (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . ICU stays, and particularly their longer duration, are per se 53 well-documented causes of malnutrition, with loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which 54 in turn may lead to poor quality of life, disability and morbidities long after ICU discharge (6). 55 Many chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and their clustering in 56 polymorbid individuals (7) as well as older age per se (8) are also very commonly associated 57 with high risk and prevalence of malnutrition and worse outcomes. Causes of ICU-and disease-58 related malnutrition include reduced mobility, catabolic changes particularly in skeletal muscle 59 as well as reduced food intake, all of which may be exacerbated in older adults (6-8). In (Table   101 1). According to GLIM, diagnosis of malnutrition requires at least 1 phenotypic criterion and 1 102 etiologic criterion. 103 The above considerations appear to be fully applicable to patients at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 104 infection or hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, since poor outcomes in COVID-19 are reported 105 in patients that are most likely to present with malnutrition (such as older adults and comorbid 106 individuals). Preserving nutritional status and preventing or treating malnutrition also 107 importantly has the potential to reduce complications and negative outcomes in patients at 108 nutritional risk who might incur in COVID-19 in the future. In particular, COVID-19 can be 109 accompanied by nausea, vomiting and diarrhea impairing food intake and absorption (2), thus a 110 good nutritional status is an advantage for people at risk for severe COVID-19. In a recent 111 6 review about potential interventions for novel coronavirus based on the Chinese experience 112 authors suggested that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated 113 before the administration of general treatments (11) . 114 Looking at influenza infections, particular predictors of mortality could be identified by 115 multivariate analysis such as type of virus (OR 7.1), malnutrition (OR 25.0), hospital-acquired 116 infection (OR 12.2), respiratory insufficiency (OR 125.8) and pulmonary infiltrate on X-ray (OR 117 6.0) were identified as predictors (12) . It should be considered that also malnourished children (11) . Malnutrition and famine were associated with high disease severity 130 and was related to mortality also in the younger population. Undernutrition remains a problem 131 for viral pandemics of the twenty-first century and beyond. Indeed, chronic malnutrition was 132 thought to have contributed to the high morbidity and mortality seen in Guatemalan children 133 7 during the 2009 influenza pandemic (12) . In a future virus pandemic, we might face a \"double 134 burden\" of malnutrition, when both undernutrition and overnutrition will promote severity of 135 disease. It is now well accepted that obesity increases one's risk of being hospitalized with, and 136 dying from, an influenza virus infection, and that obesity inhibits both virus-specific CD8+ T cell 137 responses and antibody responses to the seasonal influenza vaccine (11) . The challenge for 138 future virus pandemics is therefore not only to protect those affected by undernutrition, but 139 also the growing number of people living with obesity (11) . This is particularly important for the 140 WHO European Region as in many European countries obesity and overweight affects 30-70% 141 of the population. (14) In a recent Japanese study, malnutrition and pneumonia were identified 142 as the prognostic factors in influenza infection, which are amenable to medical intervention. 143 Using Cox proportional hazards modeling with prescribed independent variables, male sex, 144 severity score, serum albumin levels, and pneumonia were associated with survival 30 days 145 from the onset of influenza (13). 146 We provide suggestions based on various ESPEN Guidelines, with particular regard to those on 147 polymorbid internal medicine patients (7) and those on geriatrics (8). We refer the reader to 255 We suggest that general guidance on prevention and treatment of malnutrition by using ONS is 276 targets. 277 Enteral nutrition should be implemented when nutritional needs cannot be met by the oral 278 route, e.g if oral intake is expected to be impossible for more than three days or expected to be 279 below half of energy requirements for more than one week. In these cases, the use of EN may General comments: When patients are stabilized and even in prone position, enteral feeding 369 can be started ideally after measuring indirect calorimetry targeting energy supply to 30% of 370 the measured energy expenditure. Energy administration will be increased progressively. 371 During emergency times, the predictive equation recommending 20 kcal/kg/day could be used 372 and energy increased to 50-70% of the predictive energy at day 2 to reach 80-100% at day 4.",

Gastric tube is preferred 374 but in case of large gastric residual volume (above 500 mL), duodenal tube should be inserted 375 quickly. The use of enteral omega-3 fatty acids may improve oxygenation but strong evidence is 376 missing. If intolerance to enteral nutrition is present, parenteral nutrition should be considered. 377 Blood glucose should be maintained at target levels between 6-8 mmol/l, along with monitoring 378 of blood triglycerides and electrolytes including phosphate, potassium and magnesium (6). 405 The long-term prognosis of patients surviving intensive care is affected by physical, cognition 406 and mental impairment that occur following ICU stay (42). Loss of skeletal muscle mass and 407 muscle function may be tremendous and a major problem in ICU survivors (43). This may 408 particularly apply to older adults and comorbid patients that are more prone to present with 409 pre-existing catabolic conditions and impaired skeletal muscle mass and function; in addition, 410 these patient groups may be more presumably prone to develop more intense catabolic 411 responses due to COVID-19 and to ICU conditions at large. Prolonged reported duration of ICU 412 stay above two weeks for many COVID-19 patients is likely to further enhance muscle-catabolic 413 conditions. Appropriate energy delivery avoiding overfeeding and adequate protein 414 administration are critical to prevent this severe loss of muscle mass and function (see ",

In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism 68 4 (ESPEN) aims at providing concise experts statements and practical guidance for nutritional 69 management of COVID-19 patients, with regard to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of 70 older age and polymorbidity, which are all independently associated with malnutrition and its 71 negative impact on patient survival. The recommendations are based on current ESPEN 72 guidelines and further expert advice.

Since malnutrition is defined 88 not only by low body mass but also by inability to preserve healthy body composition criteria such as MUST or NRS-2002 have been long used and validated in general clinical 92 practice or in specific disease settings or conditions for malnutrition risk screening. For further 93 assessment of positive patients various tools have been used and are accepted in clinical 94 practice. These include but not limited to the Subjective Global Assessment criteria, the Mini 95 Nutritional Assessment criteria validated for geriatric patients, the NUTRIC score criteria for ICU 96 patients (8,9). A recent document globally endorsed by clinical nutrition Societies worldwide 97 has introduced the GLIM (Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition) criteria for malnutrition 98 diagnosis (10). GLIM proposed a two-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis, i.e., first 99 screening to identify \"at risk\" status by the use of validated screening tools such as MUST or 100 NRS-2002, and second, assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition",

The COVID-19 was 191 first identified in Winter of 2019 and mostly affected middle-aged to older adults. Future 192 investigations should confirm whether insufficient vitamin D status more specifically 193 characterizes COVID-19 patients and is associated to their outcome. In support to this 194 hypothesis, decreased vitamin D levels in calves have been reported to enhance risk for example, vitamin A has been defined as \"anti-infective\" vitamin since many of the 197 body's defenses against infection depend on its adequate supply. For example, vitamin A 198 10 deficiency is involved in measles and diarrhea and measles can become severe in vitamin A-199 deficient children. In addition, it has been reported that vitamin A supplementation reduced 200 morbidity and mortality in different infectious diseases, such as measles, diarrheal disease, 201 measles-related pneumonia, HIV infection, and malaria. Vitamin A supplementation also may 202 offer some protection against the complications of other life-threatening infections, including 203 malaria, infectious lung diseases, and HIV. In experimental models, the effect of infection with 204 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a kind of coronaviruses, was more pronounced in chickens fed 205 a diet marginally deficient in vitamin A than in those fed a diet adequate in vitamin A (25). 206 In general, low levels or intakes of micronutrients such as vitamins A, E, B6 and B12, Zn and Se 207 have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes during viral infections (26). This notion has 208 been confirmed in a recent review from Lei Zhang and Yunhui Liu (15) who proposed that 209 besides vitamins A and D also B vitamins, vitamin C, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as 210 well as selenium, zinc and iron should be considered in the assessment of micronutrients in 211 COVID-19 patients. 212 While it is important to prevent and treat micronutrient deficiencies, there is no established 213 evidence that routine, empirical use of supraphysiologic or supratherapeutic amount of 214 micronutrients may prevent or improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Based on the above 215 combined considerations, we suggest that provision of daily allowances for vitamins and trace 216 elements be ensured to malnourished patients at risk for or with COVID-19, in quarantine should continue regular physical activity while taking precautions. 221 Reducing infectious risk is achieved best by quarantine at home, which is heavily recommended 222 presently for all people at risk of COVID-19 and also for those infected with a rather moderate 223 disease course. However, prolonged home stay may lead to increased sedentary behaviors, 224 such as spending excessive amounts of time sitting, reclining, or lying down for screening 225 activities (playing games, watching television, using mobile devices); reducing regular physical 226 activity and hence lower energy expenditure. Thus quarantine can lead to an increased risk for 227 and potential worsening of chronic health conditions, weight gain, loss of skeletal muscle mass 228 and strength and possibly also loss of immune competence since several studies have reported 229 positive impact of aerobic exercise activities on immune function. In a recent paper. Chen et al 230 (27) conclude: \"\u2026 there is a strong rationale for continuing physical activity at home to stay 231 healthy and maintain immune system function in the current precarious environment. Exercise 232 at home using various safe, simple, and easily implementable exercises is well suited to avoid 233 the airborne coronavirus and maintain fitness levels. Such forms of exercise may include, but 234 are not limited to, strengthening exercises, activities for balance and control, stretching 235 exercises, or a combination of these. Examples of home exercises include walking in the house 236 and to the store as necessary, lifting and carrying groceries, alternating leg lunges, stair 237 climbing, stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand using a chair and from the floor, chair squats, and sit-ups 238 and pushups. In addition, traditional Tai Ji Quan, Qigong exercises, and yoga should be 239 considered since they require no equipment, little space, and can be practiced at any time. The 240 use of eHealth and exercise videos, which focuses on encouraging and delivering physical 241 activity through the Internet, mobile technologies, and television are other viable avenues for 242 12 maintaining physical function and mental health during this critical period.\" Under particular 243 precautions, even outdoor activities can be considered such as garden work (if a own garden is 244 present), garden exercise (i.e. badminton), or walking/running in the forest (alone or in small 245 family groups while maintaining a distance of 2 m minimum to others).

Reeves et al. (29) also reported energy-protein intake in 301 ARDS patients treated with NIV to be inadequate. It should be pointed out that airway 302 complications may occur with longer median non-invasive ventilation duration in NIV patients 303 treated with enteral feeding (30). The recommendation to start enteral feeding could be 304 impaired by the fact that placement of nasal gastric tube (NGT) for nutrition may result in 1) air 305 leakage that may compromise the effectiveness of NIV; 2) stomach dilatation that may affect 306 diaphragmatic function and affect NIV effectiveness (31). The above observations may account 307 at least in part for highly inadequate implementation of enteral nutrition which may result HFNC: Patients oxygenated through nasal cannula may be commonly deemed 312 medically appropriate to resume oral alimentation (33). Few studies described the 313 implementation of nutritional support when this technique is used. However limited evidence 314 indicates that calorie and protein intake may remain low and inadequate to prevent or treat 315 malnutrition in HFNC patients (34, and own unpublished data). Overlooking administration of 316 adequate calorie-protein may result in worsening of nutritional status with malnutrition and 317 related complications.

In agreement with the ESPEN guidelines on nutrition in 325 ICU (6), we summarize suggestions for COVID-19 intubated and ventilated patients as follows: 326 Statement 8 327 In COVID-19 intubated and ventilated ICU patients enteral nutrition (EN) should be started 328 through a nasogastric tube; post-pyloric feeding should be performed in patients with gastric 329 16 intolerance after prokinetic treatment or in patients at high-risk for aspiration; the prone 330 position per se does not represent a limitation or contraindication for EN. 331 Energy requirements: Patient energy expenditure (EE) should be determined to evaluate energy 332 needs by using indirect calorimetry when available. Isocaloric nutrition rather than hypocaloric 333 nutrition can then be progressively implemented after the early phase of acute illness. If 334 calorimetry is not available, VO 2 (oxygen consumption) from pulmonary arterial catheter or 335 VCO 2 (carbon dioxide production) derived from the ventilator will give a better evaluation on EE 336 than predictive equations. 337 Energy administration: hypocaloric nutrition (not exceeding 70% of EE) should be administered 338 in the early phase of acute illness with increments up to 80-100% after DAY 3. If predictive 339 equations are used to estimate the energy need, hypocaloric nutrition (below 70% estimated 340 needs) should be preferred over isocaloric nutrition for the first week of ICU stay due to reports 341 of overestimation of energy needs 342 Protein requirements: During critical illness, 1.3 g/kg protein equivalents per day can be 343 delivered progressively. This target has been shown to improve survival mainly in frail patients. 344 For persons with obesity, in the absence of body composition measurements 1.3 g/kg \"adjusted 345 body weight\" protein equivalents per day is recommended. Adjusted body weight is calculated 346 as ideal body weight + (actual body weight -ideal body weight) * 0.33 (6). Considering the 347 importance of preserving skeletal muscle mass and function and the highly catabolic conditions 348 related to disease and ICU stay, additional strategies may be considered to enhance skeletal 349 muscle anabolism. In particular, controlled physical activity and mobilization may improve the 350 beneficial effects of nutritional therapy. ICU patients who do not tolerate full dose enteral nutrition (EN) during the first week in the 354 ICU, initiating parenteral nutrition (PN) should be weighed on a case-by-case basis. PN should 355 not be started until all strategies to maximize EN tolerance have been attempted. 356 Limitations and precautions: Progression to full nutrition coverage should be performed 357 cautiously in patients requiring mechanical ventilation and stabilization. Contraindications: EN should be delayed: 359 \u2022 in the presence of uncontrolled shock and unmet hemodynamic and tissue in case of uncontrolled life-threatening hypoxemia, hypercapnia or acidosis, Precautions during the early stabilization period: low dose EN can be started: 363 \u2022 as soon as shock is controlled with fluids and vasopressors OR inotropes, while remaining 364 vigilant for signs of bowel ischemia; 365 \u2022 in patients with stable hypoxemia, and compensated or permissive hypercapnia",

The following considerations therefore can be 384 applied also to the COVID-19 patient population after extubation.385 Statement 10 386 In ICU patients with dysphagia, texture-adapted food can be considered after extubation. If 387 swallowing is proven unsafe, EN should be administered. In cases with a very high aspiration 388 risk, postpyloric EN or, if not possible, temporary PN during swallowing training with removed 389 nasoenteral tube can be performed. 390 The post-extubation swallowing disorder could be prolonged for to up to 21 days mainly in the 391 elderly and after prolonged intubation (35, 36), which makes this complication particularly 392 relevant for COVID-19 patients. As much as 24% of older patients were reported to be feeding 393 tube-dependent three weeks after extubation (37). The presence of severe post extubation 394 dysphagia was associated with severe outcome including pneumonia, reintubation and 38). Authors have recommended referring patients recognized to have swallowing 398 issues for swallowing evaluation, in order to prevent oral nutrition complications (39, 40). 399 Considering tracheostomy, most of the patients may be able to return to oral intake after this 400 procedure although prolonged tracheal cannula may delay the start of adequate oral nutrient 401 intake (41). Supplemental PN has not been extensively studied in this population but could be 402 considered if energy protein targets are not reached. 403 404",

Although definitive guidance cannot be made on416    additional specific treatments potentially due to lack of high-quality studies, and therapy needs to be considered as an integral part of the approach422 to patients victim of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ICU setting, internal medicine ward setting as 423 well as in general healthcare. Ten recommendations are proposed to manage nutritional care in 424 COVID-19 patients (Figure 1). At each step of the treatment, nutritional therapy should be part 425 of patient care, with regard for older adult, frail and comorbid individuals. Optimal outcome can 426 be improved implementing adherence to recommendations to ensure survival of this life-427 threatening disease as well as better and shorter recovery, particularly but not limited to the 428 post-ICU period. A comprehensive approach associating nutrition to life-support measures has 429 potential to improve outcomes particularly in the recovery phase. 430 While healthcare workers are busy providing personal protective equipment (PPE) for their staff 431 and training on how to use them or increasing the number of ventilators, it is also important to 432 train them on how to address the nutritional aspects of these patients. We suggest 433 stakeholders such as WHO, Ministry of Health, Nutritionists, Public Health experts develop a 434 mechanism to share this knowledge with relevant healthcare workers. Also hospital 435 procurement officers and others could consider these nutritional requirements as essential 436 needs in resource allocation process. Patients with malnutrition are more likely to be from 437 lower socio-economic groups and addressing malnutrition is an essential step in leaving no one 438 behind in this fight against the COVID 10 pandemic.",
