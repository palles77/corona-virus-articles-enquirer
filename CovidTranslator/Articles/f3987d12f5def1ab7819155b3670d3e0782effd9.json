The preliminary screening of these animals was conducted with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A large number of positive reacting monkeys were identified by ELISA, most of which were negative when tested by more specific procedures, such as Western blotting. False positive ELISA antibody tests, while sporadically encountered among most of the 50 species of oldworld primates, were especially prevalent in Mandrillus sphinx (mandrills), Macaca fasicularis (crab-eating macaques) , Macaca sifensus (lion-tailed macaques), Cercopithecus aethiops (African green monkeys), Cercopithecus neglectus (De-Brazza's guenons), Cercopithecus cephus (moustached guenons) and Miopithecus talapoin (talapoins) .",

The cause of false positive serologic tests in these other virus systems was not determined, however. Considering the importance of old-world primates as potential reservoirs for human pathogens, and the number of investigators doing serologic studies with these animals, we felt that it was important for us to spend some time on the causes of the false positive serologic reactions that we had encountered. In this paper, therefore, we will present evidence that a small proportion of monkeys of some species, and a large percentage of monkeys in others, possess serum antibodies that cross-react with a common cellular protein or proteins that are copurified with most virus antigen preparations.",

Briefly, virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation from cell culture fluid, clarified by low-speed centrifugation and filtration. Virus was further concentrated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Fractions with a refractive index corresponding to a density of 1.16-1.18 g/ml in sucrose and containing the peak Mg*+-dependent reverse transcriptase (RT) activity were collected by tube puncture, diluted with Tris-NaCl buffer, and pelleted by ultracentrifugation.

            "text": "ELISA screening of 526 old-world primate sera demonstrated a high incidence of positive reactions to one or more of the three principal screening retroviruses, HTLV-I, HTLV-III and SRV-1 (Table 1) . One hundred twenty-four out of 526 sera from 21 species of monkeys were ELISA-positive for HTLV-I antibodies, 123/526 sera from 18 species were positive for antibodies to HTLV-III, and 149/519 sera from 24 species had antibodies to SRV-1. The high incidence of ELISA-positive reactions to HTLV-I, HTLV-III and SRV-1 was surprising and led us to question the specificity of the ELISA antibody procedure. Therefore, the same sera were retested by Western blotting. A presumptive positive reaction was only scored on sera reactive by this procedure. Antibodies to HTLV-I, confirmable by Western blotting, were detected in l/2 Pan troglodytes (chimpanzees), 216 Pan pan&us (pygmy chimpanzees), 6123 M. sphinx (mandrills), l/23 M. fasicularis (crab-eating macaques), l/26 M. silensus (lion-tailed macaques), 2/5 M. maurus (Moor macaques), 202 M. niger (black macaques), 6/21 M. tonkeana (Tonkeana macaques), l/6 M. nemistrina (pigtail macaques), l/l M. radiata (bonnet macaques), 217 Cercocebus atys (sooty mangabys), 5/116 C. aethiops (African green monkeys), 4/11 Cercopithecus albogularis kolbi (Kolb's guenons), l/5 C. cephus (moustached guenon), and 4115 M. talapoin (talapoins) . Specific antibodies to HTLV-III were found in 23 monkeys, 4/7 sooty mangabys, 11/15 talapoins, 2/11 False-positive ELISA antibody reactions to one or more viruses were found in a low proportion of individuals from many different species of old-world primates (Table 1) . Six species in particular, mandrills, crab-eating macaques, lion-tailed macaques, African green monkeys and DeBrazza's and moustached guenons, were often falsely positive for all three viruses (Table 1) . We were interested, therefore, in determining why sera from these six species of monkeys possessed such high levels of nonspecific reacting antibodies. One explanation for the high incidence of false-positive ELISA antibody tests was that the positive to negative ratio (P:N) that we used as a cutoff value was too low. In these studies, we assumed that a P:N ratio of 2.0 or greater was positive. Non-specifically positive ELISA tests (ELISA positive, Western blot negative) in langurs (Presbytis entellus and P. obscurus), silver-leaf monkeys (Presbytis cristata), spotnose guenons (Cercopithecus nictitans), colobus, baboons, siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus), and orangutans (Pongo pygamaeus) were almost always in the range of 2.5-4.0 (data not shown). Exceptions were found, however, in sera from the six problem species that were antibody-positive across the board and in a high proportion of animals in each group. Table 2 shows the P:N ratios of representative monkeys from two of these six species, African green monkeys and lion-tailed macaques. False positives in these species frequently had P:N ratios above 5. It was concluded, therefore, that raising the P:N ratio to 4.0 would eliminate false-positive reactions in some monkeys, but not in the six problem species.",

A more likely explanation, however, was that these sera contained antibodies that reacted specifically or nonspecifically with normal cellular proteins present in their liver preparations.

At this time it is difficult to evaluate these findings.

ELISA antibody screening of human sera for HTLV-III is most accurate when high-risk candidates are tested. Nonspecific positives are a much bigger problem, however, when the test is used for screening of low-risk groups (Carlson et al., 1985a) . Many researchers believe, therefore, that all HTLV-III ELISA positives should be confirmed by other procedures, such as Western blotting (Carlson et al., 1985b) . In fact, some investigators state that even Western blotting may not be accurate with freeze-thawed and hypergammaglobulinemic sera, and that radioimmunoprecipitation assays should be the standard for specificity (Brun-Vezinet et al., 1986) . False-positive HTLV-III antibody reactions can also be a problem in populations considered to be at high risk. Biggar and associates (1985) found that from 12 to 25% of 250 Zairian people reacted positively in ELISA to HTLV-I, II and III. There was a strong correlation between the levels of these antibodies and the levels of antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum. One of their possible explanations for this phenomenon was \"false-positive reactivity in the ELISA assay due to cross-reactive antibodies or other unknown factors.\" Biggar (1986) has also eluded to false-positive reactions in sera from African children tested against HTLV-III (Epstein et al., 1985; Sainger et al., 1985) . False-positive reactions to human retroviruses have also been described by Snyder and associates (1976) and Snyder and Fox (1978) .",

In most species, however, ELISA antibody tests have proven fairly accurate for screening purposes. We were able to concentrate almost all of our 'true' positives into a smaller number of sera, on which we could concentrate our more specific testing. The only notable exception was in the case of sooty mangabys and Kolb's guenons; only 318 were positive for HTLV-III antibodies by ELISA, while 6115 that were tested showed characteristic HTLV-III core protein bands on Western blots. A lentivirus was readily isolated from the blood of the sooty mangabys (Lowenstine et al., 1986) . Care should also be taken not to eliminate sera that appear to be reacting falsely. Talapoins and mandrills in our study were found to have a very high incidence of nonspecific FeLV and cell debris antibodies, but this was masking a large number of HTLV-I, III and SRV-1 specific reactors (Lowenstine et al., 1986) .",
