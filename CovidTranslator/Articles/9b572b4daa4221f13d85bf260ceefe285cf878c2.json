In the light of the current epidemic, curricula in pharmacy schools in Africa should be tailored to foster public health by including specialized training in infectious disease epidemiology [7] . In Africa, a pharmacy is always the first port of call for sick patients. Pharmacists are well positioned for early disease detection within the community and provide referrals to patients for hospitals or isolation centres. Pharmacists at the community level are also well placed to educate and advise consumers on available and effective prevention and control measures, including information of new investigational drugs for the management of Ebola [7] . Also, as trusted health care professionals, they are in the right position to dispel myths or false rumors that have the potential to ferment the beginning of another outbreak. Furthermore, as promising vaccine candidates for Ebola are in the horizon [9] , pharmacists could serve as a valuable resource in vaccinating patients as it has been shown in other disease prevention programs [6] .",
