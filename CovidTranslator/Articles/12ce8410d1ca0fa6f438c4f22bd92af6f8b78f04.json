            "text": "The eoronaviruses have been classified as a separate virus group mainly or~ the basis of their distinctive morphology (12) . There have been many studies [reviewed by McI~TosH (7) ] demonstrating that the growth of these viruses is insensitive to inhibitors of DNA metabolism or DNA dependent RNA synthesis. For this reason the nature of the eoronavirus genome has been assumed to be RNA. However, there have been few reports of the results of direct chemical analyses of the virion. There have been two reports (10, ll) of extraction and analysis of nucleic acid from purified virions of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and these indicated that the virus contains I~NA. It has also been deduced from the appearance of the particles, the sensitivity of infectivity to ether and chloroform, and the mode of development of particles observed in thin sections of infected cells, that they contain lipid derived from the host as an integrM part of the outer shell. However, there are no reports on extraction and anMysis of lipids from purified particles. Although there are at least seven different, species in the eoronavirns genus (7) , only one t33oe, the human eoronavirus OCI3, has been subjected to electrophoretic analysis of the polypeptides (5) . This report describes preliminary biochemical investigations of another coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis virus. (a Massachusetts serotype) from the commercially available live vaccine, Bronvirin (Glaxo Ltd.). Each of these stocks had a long history of passage in embryonated cMcken eggs before their receipt in this laboratory.",

The kidneys from 3-7 week old specific-pathogen-free chickens (Wickham Laboratories Ltd., ~Vickham, Hampshire) were dispersed by serial 5 minutes incubations at 37 \u00b0 C in 0.05 per cent trypsin (Difeo Laboratories) in phosphate buffered saline (PBSA: Dulbecco's type A, Oxoid Ltd.). The cells obtained were strained through nylon mesh and dispensed either in Eagle's Medium Basal (BME :'Wellcome Reagents Ltd. ) or in L-15 medium (Gibco), both media being supplemented with 8 per cent foetal calf serum, 4 per cent tryptose phosphate broth, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ~g/ml streptomycin. The BME was used for cells grown in vented plastic dishes in a 5 per cent CO2 atmosphere, the L-15 used for growth of cells in closed glass bottles or tubes. For the growth of virus, confluent cell cultures were changed into maintenance medium, which was similar in composition to the growth medium but without the foetal calf serum. Estimations of virus infectivity were made by inoculating 0.2 ml aliquots of appropriate dilutions of virus into rolling tube cultures already containing 1 ml of maintenance medium. Cytopathic effects on the cells were observed at 48 hours (strain Beaudette) or 72 hours (strain Massachusetts 4t and Connecticut) after inoculation, and infecti~dty measurements experssed as TCDs0/0.2 ml. IBV-H t20 caused no distinct cytopathic effect and was not used in experiments requiring infectivity measurements. IBV-Beaudette could also be estimated by plaque formation assays, but this method was not routinely used. All cell culture and virus growth was performed at 37 o C.",

Almeida, Wellcome Research Laboratories, and were found to contain intact virus ; there was no detectable difference between the light and heavy forms. A small proportion of the virus particles became degraded on tartrate gradients, so in subsequent purifications the tartrate was replaced by a secor~d sucrose gradient.. The infectivity of the purified virus fractions was measured, and a typical result is presented in Table 2 . It, can be seen that both the light and heavy forms of the virus were i.niectious, although the heavy band was significantly more infectious with respect to protein and nucleic acid.

The amounts of RNA determined by the two methods were in very close agreement. The discrepancy in the RNA: protein ratio arises from the very different results obtained from the two methods for protein estimation. As the method of LOWRY et at. (6) is rather sensitive to interference by a variety of compounds, including sugars, it is possible that the viral nucleic acid, carbohydrate and lipid have caused sufficient interference to render the result from this method invalid.

Figure 2 illustrates typical densitometer tracings (made with a Joyce-Loebl Chromoscan) of gels which have been stained for either protein or carbohydrate. There are up to sixteen peptides present, three or four of which appear to be glycosylated. Although the profiles of the light and heavy forms appear to be dissimilar (Fig. 3a, b) , it may be seen that the same peptides are present in both, and only the relative proportions differ. Examinations of many such profiles showed that this was a reproducible phenomenon. No significant difference between strains was detected. Numbers were assigned to the peptidcs on the basis of their molecular weights to assist in comparison of profiles. The molecular weights determined from twelve experiments are listed in Table 3 . When the separated light, and heavy forms of the virus were treated with bromelain and recentrifnged on sucrose gradients, it was found that both forms yielded identical single bands of virus at a new lighter density of 1.15. These treated particles were examined by electron microscopy (by Dr. S. Patterson of this Institute) and were almost totally lacking in projections. PAGE profiles of the virus before and after treatment are illustrated in Figure 3 . I t can be seen that the bromelain removed for carbohydrate. Gels run for 5 ~/2 hours. Only those bands consistently found in every preparation have been labelled VP or VGP. 0eeasionally VP 70 showed slight staining with PAS as seen here, but this was not reprodueible two of the glycopeptides (VGP180 and VGP83) and substantially reduced the proportions of VP 130, VP 106 and VP70. As VP53 and VP49 usually tend to run as an overlapping pair, it is not possible to say whether any VP53 remains. The relative proportions of the lower molecular weight peptides have considerably increased in relation to the prominent VP 49. Three new peptides, designated XP 27, XP20 and XP18 (27,000, 20,000 and 18,000 daltons respectively) have also appeared in the profile. It seems likely that these are cleavage products of some of the larger peptides, rather than contamination with the bromelain; when brome- heavy form gave identical pattern). Gels run for 6 hours lain was electrophoresed in a parallel gel it gave several peaks, none of which coincided with the new peptides. Also it was ealculated that about 90 per cent of the added bromelain would have had to remain adhering to the virus through the purification steps after incubation in order to yield the amounts detected of the new peptides. These results suggest that VGP180, VP130, VP106, VGP83 and VP70 are accessible on the surface of the vMon, the remaining peptides presumably being internal. Newcastle Disease virus (strain Hefts) and influenza virus (strain X31) were grown in ovo, purified by exactly the same techniques and electrophoresed in parallel to the IBV preparations. Only the typical peptide bands of those viruses were detected, and there were no bands corresponding to any of the bands located in the IBV samples. This was evidence that the purification scheme used was adequate for isolating pure specimens of other enveloped viruses of similar size, density and origin to IBV without host component contamination.

            "text": "The prime question which arises when considering the observed polypeptide composition of any virus :is that of the purity of the preparation. This is especially important when there are apparently a large number of peptides present, as in this ease. The four main contaminants that may arise in purified preparations of most animal viruses are host cellular components, endogenous virus from those cells, mycoplasmas and bacteria. The second and third possibilities have been tested for and excluded in this ease, and the fourth would have been very obvious in electron microscopic examination. Also any significant level of bacterial or mycoplasmM contamination would have resulted in readily detectable quantities of DNA in the preparations. This leaves the problem of possible contamination by host cellular peptides. It is difficult to differentiate between host material that is an integral part of the virion and that which may have remained associated with the preparation through the various stages of the purification. One approach to the problem would be a comparison of virus grown in different cell types on the assumption that the peptides contributed by the host would differ in the various preparations. However, this would not resolve the question of whether it was an integral part of, or merely associated with, the virion. This is not possible with IBV anyway, due to the very restricted selection of cells in which it may be grown--the strains used here were only capable of culture in ovo or in primary chicken kidney cells. In the samples of purified virus used here, there were no major contaminants visible by electron microscopy. Although there were occasional pieces of membrane, some clearly deriving from disintegrating virions, the relative amounts of virus particles and possible host components were such that any contribution of the latter to the analysis would have been negligible. In some preparations examined there was a \"contamination\" by detached viral projections, mainly in the heavy band--as the amounts of these present varied from sample to sample, this could account for the difference in the relative proportions of the polypeptides observed in the light and heavy forms. This leaves the possibility that host polypeptides may be an integral part of the virion. It has been shown (1) that when IBV was treated with unheated rabbit antiserum raised against normal chicken cell membranes, holes appeared in the virus envelope, similar to those produced using rabbit antiserum raised against the virus itself. Use of chicken antiserum did not cause these holes. This suggested that host components were an essential part of the virus envelope.",
