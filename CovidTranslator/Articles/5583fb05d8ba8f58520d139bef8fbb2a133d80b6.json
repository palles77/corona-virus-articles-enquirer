It was indispensable for generating coronavirus-specific ELISA antibody activities that the sample was applied to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cells in parallel with the CCV-infected cells and then the optical density values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen. On the basis of ELISA antibody titers obtained in sera from the cats experimentally infected with CCV and from the spontaneous feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) cases, the ELISA described in the present study was found to be applicable as a simple and easy serologic test which was able to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies as efficiently as the indirect immunofluorescence assay with homologous FIP virus.",

            "text": "The coronaviruses are responsible for a wide variety of diseases, in particular respiratory and enteric disorders in mammalian and avian species [1] . Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) which is a chronic, progressive, immunologically-mediated coronaviral disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , is one of the most important viral infections in cats with worldwide occurrence and increasing frequency [7, 8] . A feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which causes a mild intestinal disease but not FIP in kittens, has also been isolated [9] and considered to be the result of a recombination event between virulent FIP virus (FIPV) and avirulent FIPV [10] . Feline coronavirus (FIPV and FECV) isolates thus far are divided into at least two types according to the serologic cross-reaction with canine coronavirus (CCV) by virus neutralization test (VNT) [4] , and there may be at least 2 antigenic groups of FIPV by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) analysis [10]. Human coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, CCV, FIPV and FECV compose one antigenically related group in the family of coronaviruses [1, 9, 11, 12] . Cats inoculated with CCV [13] or TGEV [14, 15] elicit immune responses against not only homologous but also heterologous virus species in the group. However, the incidence of infection in general cat population in nature with these heterologous viruses is unknown. Because FIPV has proved difficult to isolate and propagate in vitro, heterologous serologic assays (VNT, indirect immunofluorescence assay; IFA, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay; ELISA, and passive hemagglutination test) by use of antigenically related TGEV and CCV have been widely applied for detection of anti-coronavirus antibody in cats [14, 16 23] . In recent years several feline coronavirus isolates cultivable in cell cultures have led to the development of homologous serologic assays [4, [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

After 48-h incubation in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2, the cells were fixed with methanol containing 0.3% H202 for 30 min. The wells were then saturated with 250/~1 of blocking buffer which consisted of 3% gelatin in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS). After 1 h at room temperature, the blocking buffer was removed from the wells, and to which 50/~1 amounts of the test sample serially diluted in PBS containing 1% gelatin and 0.05% Tween 20 (GT/PBS) was added. The plate was incubated at 37~'C for 1 h and was washed by emptying, filling with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS from a wash-bottle and leaving for 3 min. This process was repeated 3 times. Then 50/~1 of freshly diluted 1:400 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-cat IgG goat serum (Cooper Biomedical Inc., U.S.A.) in GT/PBS was added to each well and kept for 1 h at room temperature after which plates were washed. The result was read spectrophotometrically (405 nm) by an ELISA reader (MTP-02 type; CORONA Electric Co,, Ltd, Japan) 30 min after the addition of ABTS substrate (2,2,'-azino-di(3-ethyl benzylthiazoline sulfonic acid-6)-disodium salt; Polysciences, Inc., U.S.A.) to wells. The test sample was applied to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cells in parallel with the virus-infected cells by the same manner. Optical density (OD) values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen (the corrected OD value). The ELISA titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which the corrected OD value exceeded 0.05 as shown in Fig. 1 in which typical titration curves for positive and negative sera were drawn. The ELISA titer of more than 1 : 10 was regarded as positive.",

Moreover, biopsy in the living animal or necropsy after death are considered to be the most definitive diagnosis of FIP. The serologic tests are, however, only an aid to diagnosis because anti-coronavirus antibody can be detected not only in FIP cats but also in cats with other diseases and even in healthy animals [8, 18, 19, 22, 28, 29] . The tests used routinely for detection of anti-coronavirus antibodies in felines are IFA or ELISA in which TGEV or CCV have been popularly used as the target antigen [17q9, 21] . The results in the present study indicate that the ELISA using CCV-infected cultured cells as antigens saves laborious purified viral antigen preparation, and it detects anti-coronavirus antibodies in cat sera more extensively than the MNT using CCV, and as efficiently as IFA using homologous FIPV. However, the ELISA titers were generally lower than those obtained by the IFA as shown in Table 1 . This may result from qualitical differences of the substrate antigens (i.e. heterologous or homologous coronaviruses for cat) applied in the tests as reported by others [27] .",

It has been described that most but not all of false-positive reactions are attributable to recent vaccination [17, 27, 30, 31] . Some kinds of cell culture vaccines prepared for use in cats have been commonly utilized in Japan as well. Antibodies against vaccine ingredients other than desired viral antigens, especially serum components in a tissue culture-derived vaccine, may be elicited in cats after parenteral injection and they react with antigenically similar components presented in the antigen preparations of serologic tests. Therefore serum samples should be tested in parallel against negative antigen controls and results are adjusted accordingly as in kinetics-based ELISA described by Barlough et al. [17] . In the present study, presumably because whole cultured-cell antigens were used, all cat sera showed a variety of reactivities to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cell antigens as well, and it was indispensable for generating the coronavirus-specific activity that the OD values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen.",
