Good care was taken to ensure that the main dynamical features of the continuous phase were captured by the present LES. The particle phase was studied in both Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks. Steady temperature and velocity were measured prior to droplet emission. Evolution of aerosol concentration was measured by a particle counter.

This also depends on the ventilation scheme used. Indeed, the ventilation system determines the airflow pattern in the room which in turn decides the droplet nucleus fate. Displacement ventilation has been acknowledged to provide better indoor air quality than mixing ventilation. Some existing studies that used passive gaseous and small inertial particles as contaminant sources stated that in the presence of heat sources, displacement ventilation is more contributive to pollutants removal without much mixing to the whole indoor environments and this compared to other types of ventilation [9, 10] . These studies also showed that in order to design an effective ventilation system, it is crucial to have a reliable tool that is capable to predict airflow pattern and particle distribution and dispersion indoors. This can be achieved through the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which has the capacity to provide microscopic information on the indoor air environment like the air velocity, pressure, temperature, and pollutant's concentration distribution which are useful to obtain pertinent macroscopic parameters for engineering goals.",

            "text": "Among these CFD tools, Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation has been extensively used for simulation of airflow indoors to predict the averaged velocity or temperature. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) solves directly for the transient behavior of the large-scale turbulent motion which tends to have the greatest influence on the turbulent transport but less adjustable constants are required [11] . LES approach to model turbulent flows has been recognised as a powerful tool that is able to satisfy a continuing desire for higher fidelity of predictive capabilities. Its use has been invigorated by the extraordinary development of computational facilities. Since LES solves time-dependant turbulent flows, it can provide detailed description of the turbulence phenomenon, such as three-dimensional instantaneous velocity field. Thus, LES properly accounts for the history and transport effects of turbulence on aerosol dispersion and deposition. The very informative picture of the turbulent transport provided by LES has usually been associated with a large computational expense that has prevented its use in the past. However, many recent works have shown that LES computations carried out on current computer workstations have been successfully applied to several indoor airflow problems with reasonable computation overheads [3] . Among these studies, we can mention the work of Emmerich and McGrattan [12] and Musser and McGrattan [13] who applied LES to investigate isothermal room airflow. Jiang and Chen [14] who explored the potential of LES to study natural ventilation in buildings. Zhang et al. [15] evaluated various turbulence models, including LES, in predicting airflow and turbulence in enclosed environments and Zhang and Chen [11] proposed a filtered dynamic subgrid scale model to be used in conjunction with LES of indoor airflow. All these investigations have shown the great potential of LES in predicting turbulent airflow in enclosed environments but none of them have considered thermal effects generated by human.",

            "text": "For LES of two-phase turbulent flows, the numerical simulation of the particulate trajectories and dispersion pattern in airflows are treated along two streams namely the Lagrangian and the Eulerian methods. The Eulerian methods consider the particle phase as another continuum. Transport equation for the mass concentration is derived from the mass (species) conservation conditions and solved to give details of the particle concentration field. When the particle phase is considered as scalar species, the gravitational settling and the deposition rate should be taken properly into account to reflect the aerosol's inertial character [1, 6] . For the Lagrangian methodology, the motion of the discrete matters are described by the force balance including those induced by the interactions with the carrier phase. In indoor particle studies, each method gains its own reputation depending on the research goals. The Eulerian method is widely used to predict particle concentration distributions in rooms. Generally these simulations agree well with experimental data although remarkable discrepancies exist in some studies [4] . If the particle motion and dispersion history is of interest, the Lagrangian method is more suitable. Indeed, the Lagrangian approach appears to provide a more natural description of the actual physical phenomena compared to the Eulerian approach. Investigations using two-phase LES to study particle transport in enclosed environments are rare in literature. We can mention the works of Tian et al. [16] , Bouilly et al. [17] and Chang et al.

For conventional ceiling schemes the influence of high momentum airflow overwhelms the buoyancy effect and the pollutant transport is mainly governed by the bulk airflow [5] .

Hence it is very important to study aerosol transport by displacement ventilation with internal heat sources. In the present work, measurements and numerical simulations of contaminant particle concentration evolution in a mechanically ventilated room with heated sources have been carried out. This investigation aims to provide a realistic simulation of the time-dependant flow field in a chamber populated with two heated manikins using the wellresolved LES approach. The potential of both the Lagrangian and the Eulerian approaches coupled to LES of non-isothermal airflow to study dispersion characteristics of expiratory aerosols has been explored.",

The wall temperature is set to 297 K while the occupant temperature is set to 317 K. One of the occupant is emitting droplets (source) and faces directly the second occupant (receptor). The source emits water spherical droplets with initial velocity of 10 m/s lasting for 0.1 s. Similar duration period has been adopted in the literature [19] .",

Two recent reviews have demonstrated the time scale of evaporation. Nicaset et al. [20] and Morawska [21] estimated that the shrinkage time from the original droplet to droplet nuclei is rapid and is in the order of 0.5 s. This time scale is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the residence time of the droplet nuclei suspended in the room. Also, the droplets are assumed trapped once they touch any surfaces and do not re-suspend or break up. These assumptions are valid for the present low air velocity environment. Coagulation effect has been examined by applying a simple estimation [22] . The results revealed that the coagulation effect can be neglected.",

Moreover, the near-solid turbulence has a significant impact on the deposition of inertial particles and therefore it should be properly resolved. The different non-conforming layers were designed such that the aspect ratios between the different directions for all the cells do not exceed 5. This is done to avoid numerical instabilities that arise when using very flat cells in the LES context.

In this numerical study, the Reynolds number is 1300 based on the length of the inlet opening and the expected Kolmogorov microscale is 70 microns. Consequently, one cannot seek a grid independent LES, as we usually do for RANS. This is because a grid independent LES is essentially DNS, and the philosophy of LES that is based on grid dependency, looses its meaning. Celik et al. [27] developed a method to assess the quality of LES results. It consists of estimating an index of quality which is a measure of the percentage of the resolved turbulent kinetic energy. They stated that if more than 75% of the kinetic energy is captured, then the LES is considered adequate. Pope [28] has also stated that the amount of turbulent kinetic energy that is carried by the SGS scales should not exceed 25% for the LES to be well resolved.",

In this work, Eqs. (9) and (10) were used to give such an estimation. A time step, Dt \u00bc 0.01t * was used to advance calculations. t * is the integral time scale defined as the ratio of the inlet height to the inlet velocity. The size of the time step was dictated by the numerical stability. The LES computations are initiated from a randomly generated instantaneous inlet velocity with mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles fitted to analytical formulae [31] . The time advancement was carried out until t \u00bc 150t * to achieve a flow field independent of the initial conditions. At t \u00bc 150t * , residuals of Eqs.

A cooled-jet can be easily identified near the low-level of the floor and a strong vertical buoyancy-plume is formed above the heated manikin. One key feature of displacement ventilations is the low inlet velocity. As the cold air flows around the manikin and picks up the heat, the velocity increases rapidly. It is noticed that the low momentum cooled air (0.2 m/s) near the floor level absorbs heat from the two occupants and creates a dominant vertical thermal plume in the boundary layer around each occupant. The airflow velocity is fairly weak in all regions except inside the buoyancy plume [35] and the bulk velocity is less than 0.1 m/s. This low velocity will influence significantly the convective transport of aerosol. Fig. 4 shows the predicted averaged temperature contour along the mid-plane of Y-Z direction. This shows you a clearer picture on how the temperature varied from the cooled-inlet to the exhaust. Fig. 5 shows an instantaneous velocity at the same plane. Two similar but unequal strengths of vertical plumes can be observed. Inferring carefully from both figures, it can be seem that the buoyancy plume of the heated manikin near the inlet is warmer and stronger than another one. It is due to the coolest air contacting that heated manikin while the air contacting the other manikin has been warmed.",

It was evaluated by calculating the particle injected during the emission period (0.1 s) and divided by the volume of the chamber. Figs. 6-8 show the experimental measured steady state airflow pattern and temperature distribution prior to the emission of aerosols. The results were compared with those predicted by the LES. All the results were measured at mid-plane along Y-Z. The velocity profile along the centerline of the inlet duct (i.e. Y \u00bc 0.075 m) is shown in Fig. 6 . Excellent agreement between the modeling and experiment can be observed. Due to the very low velocity and the sensitivity of the velocity probe used, there was no measurement data for Z greater than 0.6 m. It is interesting to note that a small recirculation zone is existed at Z \u00bc 0.7-0.75 m. Fig. 7 shows the temperature measurement along a central vertical line (i.e. Y from 0 to 0.5 m). The computational prediction experimental data consistently overestimates the measured temperature for most of the locations. It is interesting to notice that the discrepancy decreases with the Y-direction. The simulated results were fluctuated temperature while the experimental results were averaged value. Besides, the discrepancy may also be attributed to the uncertainty of the thermocouples. Fig. 8 depicts the temperature profile along the Z-direction at the vertical height of the spray gun. Since the separation of the two manikins was less than 0.2 m, seven thermocouples were placed. It can be seen that the measurements and modeling results agree well as it shows the increasing trend when it approaches the heated manikin.",

Figs. 9-12 show the experimental results for four locations and the results are compared with the two modeling predictions. The x-axis is the elapsed time after the aerosol emission and the y-axis is the dimensionless concentration. It should be noted that unlike Reynolds averaging methods LES gives instantaneous concentrations of particles that are convected by a turbulent flow. All the reported results were measured downstream of the emission point. Hence it can be anticipated that the concentration will decay with elapsed time. Regardless of the modeling approaches or experimental results, first three figures show clear decay profiles. For Fig. 12 where the location is at the exhaust, the result is more complex as both Lagrangian and experimental results depict non-decay profiles. It can be seen that the variation of the experimental measurement at point F is very small which is ranging from 0.01% to 0.07%. Further investigation is required to explain the observation. It is also interested to compare the ''decay'' rate for different locations as the decay magnitude should be correlated to the ''local'' air velocity. This issue will be addressed in future work. The experimental results were best fitted by an exponential function using the least square method and the corresponding decay rates are shown (Figs. 9 and 10). Inferring from the results Figs. 9 and 10, the decay rates are comparable to each. By taking into account of the uncertainly of the particle counter used which is AE12%, the agreement between the experimental results and the computational modeling predictions is acceptable [36] . In this work observable discrepancy between the modeling results by Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches is seen. More experimental results are required to validate the accuracy of the model.",
