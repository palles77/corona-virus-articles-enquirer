Understanding their transmission, and possibly forecasting the dynamics of these pathogens, represents both a scientific and sanitary emergency. To this goal, mathematical modeling has been a widely used tool. Nevertheless, they have important limitations to explicitly model the mechanisms involved in the infectious processes at the individual level. Thanks to the increase of computing capacity, computational models such as individualbased models (IBMs) are very relevant for understanding the complexity of mechanisms at the individual level that can be involved in disease outbreaks. Their computational formalism allows a large flexibility, while they rely on the same philosophy than current models in mathematical epidemiology that have proved their relevance. In this chapter, we review the main qualities of IBMs, what kind of new knowledge they can bring and they have already produced in epidemiological modeling. Then, we highlight their caveats and what could be developed during the future years to make IBMs a more reliable and useful approach.",

The corresponding scheduling algorithm is as follow: The second method consists, for each time step, to randomly draw an individual from the list of individuals, compute its new state, and then repeat the drawing for all individuals. This method considers that individuals randomly interact between the time t and t + dt. Here, interactions are asynchronous and continuous within one time step.

Knowing reproducibility to be a key process in the scientific activity, the specification of IBMs appears to be fundamental. It enables to communicate the model to pairs for validation and verification. Without unambiguous specification, pairs cannot reproduce the model, and then the simulation results. They are many different types of specification for IBMs: from pseudo-code, like in the previous section, to graphical modeling language such as UML (Unified Modeling Language, see below). Nevertheless, most of the specifications remain ambiguous and need to be complemented by a documentation. Grimm et al. have proposed the \"Overview Design Details\" (ODDs) protocol to communicate IBMs (Grimm et al., 2006) . Using ODD can improve significantly the replication of IBM simulations. The major drawback of ODD remains in the ambiguity of its terminology and the absence of a rigorous description of the simulator, i.e., the software that supports the implementation of the IBM . In a recent paper, Donkin et al. (2017) show that using ODD does not fully support replication by implementing the same IBM on two different simulation platforms (Repast and NetLogo). They found that the results not only differ in magnitude but also in trends leading to different conclusions regarding the question the model is supposed to address. This work highlights the tremendous importance to be able to specify IBMs rigorously. Despite the fundamental importance of replication in science, few works have been done regarding IBMs (Axtell et al., 1996; Bajracharya and Duboz, 2013; Donkin et al., 2017; Railsback et al., 2006; Wilenksy and Rand, 2007) . Of course, replication is time consuming and perceived as nonrewarding. It is nevertheless mandatory if we want IBM to be considered as a valid scientific tool.",

The most promising formalism for IBMs specification is probably the Discrete Events Specification System (DEVS), an operational formalism a to specify discrete events simulation models. a An operational formalism is a specification having a strict equivalence with the algorithms that implement it. It is independent from the programming language used for its implementation. DEVS is derived from discrete mathematics and relies on systems theory. It involves enough generalism to formalize discrete and continuous time models and can also merge continuous and discrete time dynamics together. (A comprehensive introduction to DEVS is available in Zeigler et al. (2000) .) From DEVS, several extensions have been proposed for specific purposes. For instance, spatially explicit systems can be formalized using Cell-DEVS, differential equations systems by using QSS (a quantized version of DEVS to solve differential equations), etc. An interesting property of DEVS extensions models is that they are all formally equivalent to DEVS models. Therefore, any models specified using a particular extension can be formally and computationally coupled with other models in a DEVS framework. This property ensures the scalability of models and promotes models reuse. Furthermore, DEVS proposes a compositional and hierarchical approach to modeling. Therefore, elementary models (called atomic models) can be coupled together to build a coupled model that can be view as an atomic model at upper hierarchical level.",

Nevertheless, going up and down in scales is not that trivial. Indeed, parameters in population mathematical models (also called mean-field models, MFMs, because they are continuous states models assuming well-mixed populations and the ergodic hypothesis) are generally expressed as rates at a population scale, while parameters in IBMs have generally to be expressed as a probability at an individual scale (deterministic IBMs are not very common and will therefore not be addressed in this chapter).

In this approach, the IBM is considered as a virtual experiment to compute the parameters of the MFM.

In such case, the modeler could fit model parameters to reproduce collected data and then calibrate the model. The main difficulty is the stochastic nature of IBM. We have therefore to use Monte Carlo techniques to fit parameters, which are difficult to implement and for which the convergence toward an optimum cannot be assert. Moreover, this problem is particularly important with IBMs when one single simulation may require minutes or hours to be achieved. Heuristic techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, can reduce the computation time for parameter exploration (Fig. 3) (Duboz et al., 2010) . Choice of some individuals that will become parents based on the fitness. Crossover/mutation: Use of parents to create new individuals, the offspring. Several parents' genotypes can be mixed (crossover) and/or modified (mutation). Evaluation: Computation of the phenotype and the fitness of the offspring. Replacement: Choice of the individuals (among parents and offspring) which will constitute the next generation (based on the fitness). Nevertheless, convergence is still an issue and IBMs calibration remains difficult when the number of parameters is large. Some methodological developments in Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) have started addressing this problem. ABC has the potential to optimize an IBM's structure and parameters within an established statistical framework. In their paper, Van der Vaart et al. (2015) showed that ABC can potentially represent uncertainty in IBM parameters, structure, and predictions. However, work remains to be done in developing ABC for IBM with a large number of parameters.",

Nevertheless, the current multistrains mathematical models were involving mathematical assumptions in order to reduce the complexity of this problem that consequently underestimate transmission. While these assumptions are not problematic with human influenza viruses where direct transmission is short and intense, relying on these assumptions for environmental transmission, which operates on a longer term, would yield to a disappearance of this transmission route. Through the development of an IBM validated to reproduce the same dynamics than an equivalent mathematical one (Roche et al., 2011) , its investigation has been able to show the importance of this transmission in avian influenza genetic diversity (Roche et al., 2014) .",

It consists in selecting observational data characterizing the processes under study, the patterns (for instance the evolution of total biomass in time if we are interested in population tree growth), and measuring the distance between observations (selecting several independent patterns) and the model output. The idea is to increment the complexity of the model until the fit with the patterns is considered acceptable (the distance between the patterns and simulation output is small). An important contribution to this method is the use of an information criterion similar to AIC to select the best model (Piou et al., 2009 ). As we said previously regarding IBM calibration, ABC can be used to optimize the model ( Van der Vaart et al., 2015) and could be combined with an information criterion to select the best model. When using the POM, the modeler selects the minimum set of processes and their formulation necessary to reproduce the field data. The use of a parsimony criterion increases the confidence we have on the ability of the model to effectively represent the processes that occur in the real system, therefore increasing the knowledge we have on it.",

IBMs rely on complex computational code, and that is rarely made available to the whole scientific community. As a consequence, most of the results produced by these IBMs are not reproducible, which casts doubts on their validity because epidemiological outcomes could be the result of coding errors or even hidden process not explained in model description. This is even more detrimental because some specification norms (DEVS, see previously) already exist, but are not well disseminated in the epidemiological literature. This concern leads to a lack of confidence in this approach, which is extremely detrimental for the use of IBMs in many fields and not only for epidemiological studies.
