            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the coronaviridae family, which can cause acute and highly contagious enteric disease of swine characterized by severe entero-pathogenic diarrhea in piglets. Currently, the vaccines of PEDV are only partially effective and there is no specific drug available for treatment of PEDV infection. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against PEDV infection, five shRNA-expressing plasmids targeting the N, M, and S genes of PEDV were constructed and transfected into Vero cells. The cytopathic effect and MTS assays demonstrated that two shRNAs (pSilencer4.1-M1 and pSilencer4.1-N) were capable of protecting cells against PEDV invasion with very high specificity and efficiency. The two shRNA expression plasmids were also able to inhibit the PEDV replication significantly, as shown by detection of virus titers (TCID 50 /mL). A real-time quantitative RT-PCR further confirmed that the amounts of viral RNAs in cell cultures pre-transfected with these two plasmids were reduced by 95.0 %. Our results suggest that RNAi might be a promising new strategy against PEDV infection.",

The genome comprised four structural proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein] and four nonstructural proteins (1a, 1b, 3a, and 3b). Several viral proteins are important for inducing an immune response to PEDV. The S glycoprotein of PEDV plays an important role in induction of neutralizing antibodies, specific receptor binding, and cell membrane fusion [9] . And the S glycoprotein of PEDV possessed an immunodominant region S1 plays a crucial role in the early steps of infection [10] . The M protein plays an important role in the viral assembly process [11] , also can neutralize anti-M antibody in the present of complement [12] , and stimulate the production of a-interferon [13] .

At present, several PEDV vaccines have been developed [15] [16] [17] . However, the efficacy of the available commercial vaccines is limited or the protective immunity is insufficient [18, 19] . So, it is urgently needed to develop a high-effective, rapid-acting antiviral strategy against PEDV. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism by which double-stranded RNA directs sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells [20] . The use of RNAi has been successfully applied in infection inhibition studies of human and other animal viruses in vitro and in vivo, such as SARS-CoV [21] , influenza virus A [22] , tick-borne encephalitis virus [23] , porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus [24] , and foot-and-mouth disease virus [25] .

However, currently available vaccines and antiviral drugs are of limited value. Since 2010, PED had re-emerged in vaccinated swine herds, which leads to significant economic losses in swine husbandry in China [30] [31] [32] . RNAi is a natural cellular process mediated by small dsRNA that triggers sequence-specific gene silencing at the post-transcriptional level. RNAi can be introduced into the cells using two different approaches, exogenously introduced synthetic siRNAs or plasmid/viral vector constructs containing shRNAs. Although cells transfected with synthesized siRNAs can achieve effective silencing of a target gene, the effects are transient. The plasmid or virus vectors-based shRNAs can be cleaved by Dicer to produce siRNAs in the host cells, which can circumvent the disadvantages of chemically synthesized siRNAs using stably transfected. In terms of the fight against viral diseases, RNAi has been applied successfully to inhibit the replication of human and animal viruses using the plasmid vector constructs containing shRNAs [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . In this study, we designed five siRNAs targeting various regions of N, M, and S genes of PEDV and corresponding shRNA expression plasmids were constructed. These plasmids were transfected into Vero cells; then the cells were infected with PEDV; finally, after incubation for 48 h, the antiviral activity of those plasmids in Vero cells was assessed by CPE, virus titers, MTS, and quantitative real-time PCR.",

It has been applied successfully to inhibit the replication of a number of viruses, such as porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus [39] and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus [37] in vitro. In this study, Vero cells transfected with the above five vectors and the negative control vectors were challenged with PEDV. Through the assessments of CPE observation, MTS assay, virus titers, and quantitative real-time PCR, the results showed that the two plasmids pSilener4.1-M1 and pSilener4.1-N, which expressing the specific shRNA targeting the PEDV gene sequences, were effectively able to inhibit the replication of PEDV. They were able to prevent Vero cells from forming CPE, and could make 1000-fold decreases of virus titers detected by TCID50. Furthermore, the results of quantitative real-time PCR showed that the two plasmids could effectively inhibit the replication of PEDV by 94.4 and 94.5 %. Now, developing the economic and effective approaches to handle PEDV is an important goal for the swine industry. Currently, vaccination, improved husbandry, and breeding pigs for improved resistance are the traditional strategies. Recently, transgenic RNAi has been developed to assist in the fight against disease. Recent research involving the phenomenon of RNAi indicates that technologies which take advantage of this evolutionary conserved process can be developed to generate transgenic animals resistant to a wide variety of different infectious diseases [40, 41] . In our study, two most effective siRNAs targeting the M and N genes in the PEDV genome were selected and corresponding shRNA expression plasmids were constructed. Also, the results demonstrated that the two plasmids could clearly inhibit the replication of PEDV in Vero cells. These findings demonstrate that RNAi could reduced viral replication in vitro significantly, thus it may be good candidate for further study of PEDV infection. ",

The designed siRNA sequences were as follows Vero cells (1 9 104 per well) seeded in 96-well plates were treated as described in ''Cell transfection and virus infection'' section, the amounts of plasmids were 0.2 lg/ well and the cells were challenged with PEDV at 100 TCID50 in each well. After 36 h, cell viability was assessed by adding 20 lL/well of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS, Promega Biotech Co. Ltd., USA) to cell cultures according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated for 4 h with MTS, light absorbance of each solution was measured at 490 nm. Subtract the average 490 nm absorbance from the ''no cell'' control wells from all other absorbance values to yield corrected absorbances. The cell viability % was calculated by the treated cell OD value divide the OD value from the normal cell. The experiment was repeated three times and each performed in triplicate.PEDV cultures in shRNA-transfected Vero cells were collected 48 h after viral infection. After three freezethaw cycles, the viral titer was measured using 50 % tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) assays. The cultures were serially diluted tenfold from 10 -1 to 10 -10 , and added onto a monolayer of Vero cells in 96-well culture plates. Each dilution was added to three wells. After 3 days of infection, the TCID 50 was calculated by the Reed-Muench method.To assess the influence of shRNAs on PEDV replication, the N gene of PEDV was used as a standard for the PEDV genome. ShRNA-transfected Vero cells were harvested after 48 h of PEDV infection, and total RNA were extracted using the TaKaRa MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction kit (Takara Bio, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These RNA temples were stored for further experiment. The levels of N mRNA transcripts were determined by qPCR using the one Step SYBR \u00d2 PrimeScript TM",
