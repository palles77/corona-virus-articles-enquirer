Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and the more recently identified human metapneumovirus (HMPV) all cause respiratory tract infections. However, in a substantial proportion of respiratory tract infections, no etiologic agent is detected (1) , which suggests unknown pathogens. A previously unknown virus likely involved in children's respiratory tract infections has been recently described in Sweden (2) and was also identified in Australia (3) and Japan (4) . This newly identified virus shares a high sequence identity and a similar genomic organization with bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus, 2 related members of the Bocavirus genus in the Parvovirinae subfamily of the Parvoviridae family, and it was provisionally named human bocavirus (HBoV).",

AM160609 to AM160615). The nucleotide sequences were aligned with the ClustalW software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbor-joining through the Institut Pasteur website (http://www.pasteur.fr) with the DNADist and neighbor-joining software packages of the PHYLIP program. The default transition to transversion ratio of 2.0 was retained. We computed 100 bootstrap datasets with random sequence addition to generate consensus trees. BPV, bovine parvovirus; MVC, canine minute virus (minute virus of canine).",
