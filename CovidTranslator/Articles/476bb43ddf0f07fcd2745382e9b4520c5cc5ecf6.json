There is widespread agreement that specific biological control agents are much to be preferred, on environmental grounds, over chemical pesticides. But the dangers of nonspecific biocontrols are great, and much damage has resulted from their use 2 .",

They are derived from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), a baculovirus, which has a wide and sporadic host range in the lepidoptera. There are around 2,500 species of lepidoptera in Britain 3 , and of course many times more elsewhere. The records of host range of this virus4--6, based on a small fraction of the known species, show that, of twe lve superfamilies tested . eight apparently contain 'permissive' species (species killed by fewer virus polyhedra than are produced by one dead caterpi llar). With this and other baculoviruses one species in a genus may be permissive, others resistant and the LD50s vary markedly between different permissive species, without apparent regard for taxonomy.",

But unless they can be further engineered to be absolutely specific for a known set of (pest) species, it is difficult to see that they could be used safely in an uncontrolled way in the field.
