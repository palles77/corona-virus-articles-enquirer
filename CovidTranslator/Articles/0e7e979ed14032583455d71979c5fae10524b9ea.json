When tissue is prepared for microbiologic isolation, the lung should be minced rather than crushed, because hyphate fungi (e.g., zygomycetes) may fail to grow in culture after maceration. 9 A pathologist should not place a lung biopsy sample directly into fixative without first considering a diagnosis of infection.

A number of infections can damage the large airways and lead to bronchiectasis. Reversible cylindrical bronchiectasis may appear radiographically after an acute bacterial pneumonia.

Patients may suffer from a modest degree of immunosuppression due to diabetes or ethanolism. The organism can be inhaled from contaminated water and air-conditioning sources, and these have led to point outbreaks of infection. The diagnosis of Legionella infection is currently established noninvasively by immunoassays; however, the disease may be identified histologically in biopsy or autopsy tissues. The infected lung characteristically shows a fibrinohistiocytic response with alveolar filling by fibrin and necrotic macrophages with a sparse neutrophilic component, (Fig. 7-46A ), although its histology may also be indistinguishable from that of pyogenic infections. 49 It can be mimicked by acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia (AFOP), a recently recognized noninfective pattern of pulmonary injury (see Fig. 7 -46B). Although Legionella is a gramnegative coccobacillus, it stains weakly with Gram stains, and silver impregnation stains are required to blacken the organisms, which are often abundant in situ in the absence of prior treatment ( Fig. 7-47A) . Legionella micdadei is distinguished by its staining with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stains (see Fig. 7-47B) . infiltrates, pleural effusions, or pulmonary hypertension. 52 The characteristic change in the disorder is the accumulation of foamy macrophages that show intense staining with PAS ( Fig. 7-51 ). In some cases, microgranulomas that are histologically comparable to those seen in sarcoidosis may confuse the diagnosis (Fig. 7-52) , and the PAS staining in these granulomas may be equivocal as well. It is uncertain whether sarcoidosis is associated with Whipple disease or whether the sarcoidal granulomas are evidence of early infection. In these cases, a small-bowel biopsy usually establishes the diagnosis. Further confirmation can be achieved by ultrastructural examination demonstrating the bacillary organisms ( Fig. 7-53 ) or by specific PCR.",

It most commonly causes intestinal malabsorption, but pulmonary and neurologic disease also occurs. In the lung, Whipple disease can manifest as interstitial hilar lymph nodes, from which they can enter the systemic circulation to spread to other organs. Progression of infection is limited by the acquisition of effective cell-mediated immunity. 54 The initial pulmonary focus of infection (Ghon focus) heals by fibrosis and may show dystrophic calcification. This Ghon focus and the accompanying calcified site of infection in a hilar lymph node are termed the Ranke complex ( Fig. 7-54 tologic correlate is destruction of lung tissue (Fig. 7-56) with loss of the underlying reticulin stroma. But the latter finding is not apparent in H&E-stained sections, so it is best, in practice, to refer to tuberculous lesions as either \"necrotizing\" or \"nonnecrotizing\" and to avoid the terms \"caseating\" and \"noncaseating.\" Because the response to mycobacterial infection reflects a component of immune hypersensitivity, even small numbers of organisms can evoke substantial lung injury, and this complicates the task of identifying mycobacteria in situ. The organisms are best identified by their red color in AFB-stained sections (i.e., Ziehl-Neelsen stain or one of its modifications, such as Fite-Ferraco stain). Mycobacteria can show substantial morphologic variability. They are curvilinear, vary in length, and exhibit a characteristic beaded appearance attributable to nonhomogeneous uptake of the AFB stain (Fig. 7-57A) .",

Histologically, the lung shows necrotizing granulomas in areas of scarring and traction bronchiectasis (Fig. 7-65 ) resulting from the initial mycobacterial infection.

Mycobacterium-avium intracellulare, also called Mycobacterium-avium complex (MAC), can attack the lung in a variety of clinical settings. 58 Patients immunosuppressed by HIV/AIDS can develop virulent infections with features that mimic tuberculosis. If adaptive T cell-mediated immunity is severely compromised, the host response may be limited to foamy histiocytes that have ingested large numbers of mycobacteria. 59 MAC can be demon-isms via the bloodstream can yield miliary disease, in which innumerable foci of active infection with poorly formed granulomas are seen (Fig. 7-60) . 55 Tuberculous acinar-nodose bronchopneumonia results from mycobacterial infection that extends along the pulmonary acinus ( Fig. 7-61) . Tuberculomas are defined foci of nodular tuberculous infection (Fig. 7-62 ). Cavitation of a tuberculoma into an adjacent bronchus can lead to the discharge of numerous bacilli with cough or expectoration (Fig. 7-63A ). Although bacillary counts in cavitary lesions are typically high, even large cavities at times fail to show a single identifiable organism by histochemical staining, and the diagnosis must be made presumptively based on histologic appearance and empiric response to anti-tuberculosis medications. 56 The extension of cavitary disease to involve an accompanying pulmonary artery may produce a Rasmussen aneurysm and risk of vascular rupture leading to fatal hemoptysis (see Fig. 7-63B) . atelectasis. The lesions of MAC infection are detected radiographically as \"tree-in-bud\" opacities, reflecting terminal bronchiolar infection (Fig. 7-67A) , together with nodules that may be solid or cavitary. Histologically, the pathology often shows extensive areas of non-necrotizing epithelioid histiocytes and is highly characteristic (see Fig. 7-67B) . The causative mycobacteria are indistinguishable from M. tuberculosis, and only culture or PCR can accurately establish the diagnosis. A recently described variant of MAC infection is known as \"hot tub lung.\" The lung shows a microgranulomatous hypersensitivity pneumonitis that may be accompanied by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. The pathology appears to represent primarily a cell-mediated hypersensitivity response to mycobacterial antigens, with a possible element of direct infection as well (Fig. 7-68 ).",

In areas of mycelial growth, organisms become tangled, bulbous, and distorted, and it may be impossible to confirm the diagnosis with accuracy based on morphology (see Fig. 7-95B) . Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (\u00d7600) shows multiple narrow buds that resemble a ship's wheel, but this diagnostic feature is not always present. The aspergil, a ritual implement used in the Roman Catholic mass, resembles the fruiting body of Aspergillus and gives the fungus its name (Fig. 7-96) . Fruiting bodies develop from mycelia in areas of high oxygen tension, such as lung or sinus cavities, but do not develop in tissues. They are composed of a vesicle with one or two layers of phialides that produce the infective conidial spores, and the morphology of the fruiting body allows for accurate speciation in situ. In general, the specific diagnosis of \"aspergillosis\" should be avoided unless the aspergil is identified, because other fungi can be morphologically almost indistinguishable in tissue. Diagnoses are therefore optimally phrased as \"acute-angle branching hyphae consistent with aspergillus.\"",

It is not certain whether the fungus plays an opportunistic role in exacerbating an atopic response or is primary in its pathogenesis. 80 Patients develop intractable bronchospasm, with elevated serum IgE levels specific for Aspergillus spp. The pathology includes central cystic bronchiectasis with mucoid impaction (Fig. 7-98A) . The impacted mucus is viscid and forms a cast of the airways, a disorder termed plastic bronchitis. Microscopically, the mucus plugs show layers of degenerating eosinophils interspersed within the mucin (see Fig. 7-98B) , and the surrounding lung may show patchy eosinophilic pneumonia. The fragmented fungal hyphae can at times be difficult to identify (see Fig. 7-98C ), so silver stains should be applied routinely in the evaluation of allergic mucus plugs. Whereas the clinical and histologic features of this disorder are most frequently caused by hypersensitivity to Aspergillus spp., other fungi, such as Candida spp., can yield a comparable syndrome. A subset of patients with cystic fibrosis develop concomitant ABPA, and establishing the diagnosis in this setting can be difficult. 37 Bronchocentric Granulomatosis Bronchocentric granulomatosis appears to reflect an abnormal cell-mediated response to Aspergillus spp. or, less commonly, other fungi (e.g., Candida spp., and C. immitis), in which smallbirefringent crystals and cholesterol crystals. Whereas CD8-positive lymphocytes characteristically predominate in BAL fluid specimens, immunostains reveal dominance of either CD4-or CD8-positive lymphocytes in situ. In addition, other histopathologies, including nonspecific cellular interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), organizing pneumonia, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (LIP), and non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation resembling sarcoidosis, can be caused by hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Patients may be asymptomatic, or they may present with episodes of hemoptysis, at times massive and requiring emergent bronchial arterial embolization or definitive resection. The morphology of the hyphae in a fungus ball is frequently distorted, and it can be impossible to identify the diagnostic septate, acute-angle branching forms. Aspergillus fungus balls show heterogeneous staining intensity on H&E stain (see Fig.  7 -103C), giving the impression of alternating zones of growth. The wall of the fungus ball frequently shows increased numbers of tissue eosinophils (see Fig. 7-103D) .The Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon is often present and is reassuring evidence that angioinvasion is unlikely, unless there has been a recent super- vening cause of immunosuppression or neutropenia. The walls of the cavity are lined with granulation tissue, granulomatous inflammation, or metaplastic squamous epithelium, depending on the activity of the disease. The occasional presence of germinative fruiting bodies of Aspergillus spp. with characteristic phialides and conidial forms allows definitive speciation.

Diffusion of oxalate into surrounding blood vessels is prothrombotic and can lead to extensive ischemic necrosis (see Fig. 7 -104B, C).

The hyphae of the zygomycetes are well stained by hematoxylin, and they have a proclivity to produce ribbon-like structures (see Fig. 7-111B ), but caution in diagnosis is required, because treated Aspergillus can assume this appearance as well.

This process can evoke wheezing, migratory pneumonia, and blood eosinophilia, a complex termed Loeffler syndrome.

Strongyloides stercoralis is most often seen in the tropics, but is also endemic to the southeastern United States. Patients receiving high doses of corticosteroids are susceptible to infection and what is termed \"hyperinfection.\" In hyperinfection, filariform organisms exit the gut and migrate to the lungs, where they may be found in airways, alveoli, and blood vessels, and produce a hemorrhagic and eosinophilic pneumonia. If normal pathways of maturation are inhibited, the filariform larvae mature to egg-laying adults that give rise to rhabditiform larvae, and the presence of expectorated ova indicates hyperinfection (Fig.  7-123A) .

Mosquitoes transfer microfilariae into subcutaneous tissues, where they mature silently and enter the systemic venous circulation. From there, they travel to the right side of the heart, but in humans they do not mature further. Pulmonary disease reflects embolism of a nonviable helminth from the heart into the pulmonary circulation, where it typically lodges in a small, muscular artery to produce an area of localized, rounded infarction with a chronic immunologic reaction to the dead worm. 94 The embolic event itself may be clinically silent or associated with chest pain, fever, chills, hemoptysis, and peripheral blood eosinophilia. The disease is often first recognized as a solitary pulmonary nodule that is resected to exclude neoplasia. Microscopically, one sees a rounded area of pulmonary infarction ( Fig. 7-124A ). The diagnosis is facilitated by identification of the coiled nematode within an occluded muscular pulmonary artery. The area of surrounding necrosis is enclosed by a zone of granulomatous inflammation with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and variable degrees of tissue eosinophilia, all contained within a dense fibrous capsule. Trichrome, elastic, and reticulin stains highlight the features of the helminth and help to localize it in a vessel (see Fig. 7 -124B and C). Dirofilaria are distinguished from other nematodes by their prominent, muscular lateral cords and a striated cuticle that bulges inward in the region of the lateral cords, yielding a \"bat wing\" appearance.",

An epidemic of inhalational anthrax occurred in 1979 at a biofacility in Sverdlovsk, in the former U.S.S.R, and in 2001 there was a limited epidemic of anthrax due to contaminated letters sent through the U.S. mail service by an unidentified terrorist. 99 Cutaneous penetration by the bacillus produces a necrotic eschar with rapid extension to blood vessels resulting in bacteremia, sepsis, meningitis, and death. However, the most deadly form of infection is pulmonary. In these cases, the bacilli are inhaled and proliferate rapidly in the lung, where they produce a localized hemorrhagic pneumonia with associated pleural effusion and scant neutrophilic reaction (Fig. 7-132) . They then spread via the pulmonary lymphatics to the regional lymph nodes to produce hemorrhagic mediastinitis, followed by bacteremia, toxic shock, and death in a high percentage of cases. The diagnosis must be suspected and treated early to effect a cure. However, the disease has most often first been recognized at autopsy, where tissues prove to be teeming with bacteria.",

The causative agent is Yersinia pestis, a gram-negative rod that is carried by animal fleas. 100 Infection occurs from contact with infected animals, with transmission occurring via aerosol or direct contact with infected secretions. Throughout history, the black rat, Rattus rattus, has been most responsible worldwide for the persistence and spread of plague in urban epidemics, but any rodent can mechanically transmit infected fleas. Although Y. pestis has not yet been seen as a bioterrorist agent, it has received attention as a potential weapon of mass destruction, because as few as 1 to 10 bacilli are sufficient to cause infection when introduced via the oral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or intravenous route. Yersinia produces a necrotizing hemorrhagic pneumonia and large numbers of extracellular organisms that can be seen with H&E staining (Fig. 7-133) . Pulmonary infection leads rapidly to bacteremia and to death by sepsis.",
