(10, 11) Given that hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities that are common in the acute phase of severe illness can potentiate cardiac arrhythmias, the exact arrhythmic risk related to COVID-19 in patients with less severe illness or those who recover from the acute phase of the severe illness is currently unknown. Improved understanding of this is critical, primarily in guiding the need for additional arrhythmia monitoring (e.g., mobile cardiac telemetry) post discharge and whether an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or wearable cardioverter defibrillator will be needed in those with impaired left ventricular function thought secondary to COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

A thorough travel history and assessment of contact with individuals/family members who were sick or received hospitalization is mandatory.

Due to the increased numbers of COVID-19 cases and the anticipated impact on health care resources (e.g., hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, PPE, and the blood supply), it is recommended, and increasingly mandated, to postpone or cancel non-urgent, elective procedures. The definition of what constitutes an elective/nonurgent case should be based on individualized risk assessment, informed by the patient's clinical status.In general, it is reasonable to consider deferring any test or procedure that is unlikely to directly impact clinical care or outcomes over the next several months. Importantly, the rationale for delaying non-urgent or elective procedures should ideally be discussed with the patient and documented in the medical record.(Figure 1) In contrast, semi-urgent, urgent, or emergent procedures include those in which there is:\u2022 Threat to the patient's life if the procedure is not performed urgently\u2022 Threat of permanent dysfunction of an extremity or organ system \u2022 Risk of rapidly worsening to severe symptoms Urgent, or Emergent Procedures (Figure 1): Procedures are considered urgent or emergent if they substantially decrease the risk of clinical decompensation, hospitalization, or death. Screening for COVID-19 should be performed if suspected, and a high level of suspicion for COVID-19 infection should be maintained a.

This includes resource stewardship, keeping themselves safe while delivering care, and collaboration with other healthcare professionals on the front lines. (Figure 3) 6. Remote Device Monitoring: A substantial number of EP patients with a CIED have remote monitoring, which remains a powerful tool for off-site cardiac rhythm management. Current guidelines give remote monitoring a Class I recommendation for routine use in patients with CIEDs.(13) Despite its effectiveness, remote monitoring is significantly underutilized due to a variety of patient-and system-based issues. In the midst of the pandemic, remote monitoring should be used in most circumstances to reduce the need for non-urgent clinic visits. When feasible remote monitoring should be reconsidered in patients who are currently not enrolled. 7. Resource Conservation and Training for all Personnel: As the pandemic spreads and affects more individuals, resource conservation becomes even more important. Accordingly, it is critical to conserve valuable resources, such as PPE, medical and ancillary staff, by minimizing routine patient health care that can be postponed in the short to intermediate term. While hospitals in currently low incidence geographies may feel confident of their capacity to handle elective procedures, current projections predict a spread of COVID-19 that is likely to overwhelm resources. Social distancing, limiting exposure of patients with COVID-19 infection to other patients and health care personnel, and access to testing regardless of the incidence of the infection are critically important steps. Patient education about these measures should be reinforced at every opportunity. 8. Tele-Medicine and Digital Health Paradigms. While effective utilization of telemedicine pre-dated the pandemic, it was largely limited by technical and reimbursement barriers. In the current COVID-19 crisis, adoption of virtual medical services is rapidly increasing. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have expanded telehealth services to \"keep people safe\" and help health care providers focus on individuals who have the \"most dire health care needs.\" At the present time, tele-medicine can be provided by phone, and using several secure messaging applications and platforms. Physicians should familiarize themselves with the federal, state and local policies/regulations and follow procedures at their own institutions. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) for the U.S Department of Health and Human Services recently released a notification of enforcement discretion for tele-health, and are allowing the use of any",

            "text": "It is important for hospitals to review the ventilation system of their EP labs to determine if there is sharing of air return that might require disinfection of other rooms. Where possible, procedure time should also be minimized. As an example, among patients undergoing VT ablation, extensive VT induction and activation mapping may be minimized to reduce risk.Same day discharges after device implant should be considered to minimize the patient's risk of nosocomial infection. To minimize transport of infected patients, direct-current or chemical cardioversions can be performed at the bedside in the ICU with suitable anesthesia support. Lastly, when feasible, patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection should be scheduled as the last-case of the day, given the extensive cleaning required after the procedure. The CDC's recommendations for environmental cleaning and disinfection should be followed. (See link below).The majority of incision site inspections post CIED implantation or catheter ablation can be managed via tele-health by inspecting the site utilizing a video conference or by asking the patient to send a picture via secure email. Similarly, many of the clinic follow-ups and some new consults can be performed via tele-health, leveraging electronic medical record data and obtaining vital signs and ECG tracings using digital wearables where available. As the number of app-based technologies evolves, they will continue to be an integral part of telehealth. Examples of low risk patients for whom in-person visits could be deferred include",

            "text": "At the time of this writing, it is unclear what medications may be beneficial for patients with COVID-19. Off-label use of some medications is currently being investigated.While we are not recommending any specific treatment, safety guidance for clinicians using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may be requested of EP providers. HCQ is known to block Kv11.1 (HERG) and can cause drug-induced LQT.(15) The clinical arrhythmic toxicity (syncope and torsade de pointes) is largely limited to chronic use (due to its long half-life of 40 days), use of multiple concomitant QT prolonging medications (e.g. azithromycin), metabolic derangements, renal failure, or in the setting of an acute overdose.(16,17) To date, it has been widely tolerated in most populations as an antimalarial and safely used in the rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus populations without ECG monitoring.(18) Because the proposed HCQ therapy for COVID-19 is relatively short (e.g. 5-10 days), the risk of arrhythmic toxicity is likely quite low. There are specific precautions to be considered for select patients, however:\u2022 Patients with known congenital Long QT Syndrome\u2022 Patients with severe renal insufficiency should have the dose reduced (50% for CrCl <10 mL/min) \u2022 Patients on QT prolonging drugs \u2022 Electrolyte imbalances (e.g. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) must be corrected prior to use, with regular monitoring None of the above conditions is an absolute contraindication if use of HCQ is warranted. It is reasonable to temporarily stop class III antiarrhythmic drugs, with use of a reasonable alternative if there is evidence of QT prolongation. Importantly, aggressive electrolyte correction can mitigate arrhythmic toxicity. ECG monitoring should be considered for patients on multiple QT prolonging medications and avoidance or careful monitoring may be required for congenital LQT patients. Additional guidance for navigating and circumventing the QTc prolonging and torsadogenic potential of pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 has been recently published.(19) 10. Concluding Statements. At this unprecedented time, it is important that patients feel that physicians and health care systems are not abandoning them. Many patients with arrhythmias are among the sickest of those with cardiovascular disease. To protect patients (many of whom are high risk due to coexisting comorbidities) and healthcare teams from COVID-19 exposure, preserve resources and maintain access to necessary cardiovascular care, it is important that nonessential encounters, tests and procedures be postponed. While electrophysiology is uniquely suited to leverage virtual care and remote monitoring, it is important to assure patients that they have our full support, and we are ready and able to provide care as necessary. 11.
