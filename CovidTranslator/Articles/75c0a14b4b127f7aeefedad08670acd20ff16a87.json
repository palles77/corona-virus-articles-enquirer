The principal functions of the gastrointesti nal tract are assimilation of nutrients and excretion of the waste products of digestion. Most nutrients are ingested in a form which is either too complex or insoluble for absorp tion. Within the gastrointestinal tract, these substances are solubilized and degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size and in a form which permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium. In the following section, the normal biochemi-283 cal processes of intestinal secretion, digestion, and absorption are described. With these in perspective, we then discuss the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the most important gastrointestinal diseases and the biochemical basis for diagnosis and treatment.",

Two types of secretory cells are found in the acinar portions of the salivary glands: (1) the mucous cells, which contain droplets of mucus, and (2) the serous cells, which contain multiple secretory granules. In those species which produce salivary amylase, the secretory granules are the zym\u00f6gen precur sors of this enzyme. A third cell type is found lining the striated ducts. The striations along the basal borders of these cells are caused by vertical infoldings of the cell membrane, a characteristic of epithelial cells involved in rapid movement of water and electrolytes. The primary secretion of the acinar cells is modified by active transport processes of the ductal epithelium.",

The resistance of mucin to enzymatic break down is also due to the presence of disaccharide residues.

Salivary amylase splits the a-1,4-glucosidic bonds of various polysaccharides. The sali vary enzyme is similar in all major respects to pancreatic \u03b1-amylase, which is described below (Section II,D). Salivary amylase initiates digestion of starch and glycogen in the mouth of those species which secrete the enzyme. The optimal pH for amylase activity is approximately 7, and activity therefore terminates when the enzyme mixes with acidic gastric contents.",

In ruminants, saliva serves several unique functions (Phillipson, 1977) . It is required for maintenance of the composition of the contents of the rumen. The great buffering capacity is necessary to neutralize the large amounts of short-chain fatty acids which are the major end products of rumen fermentation. The urea in saliva can be utilized by rumen bacteria for protein synthesis. Protein synthesized in the rumen is then used to meet dietary protein require ments. In this way, urea nitrogen can be \"recycled\" through the amino acid pool of the body and in ruminants need not be considered an end stage in protein catabolism. The ability to reutilize urea has also been demonstrated in the horse and may be of particular benefit during periods of protein deficiency (Houpt and Houpt, 1971; Prior et al., 1974) .",

The controversy with regard to the role of cyclic AMP as a mediator of histamine action has come from observations that prostaglandins and secretin, both potent inhibitors of gastric HC1 secretion, also stimulate adenylate cyclase (Thompson et al., 1977) . It is now believed that prostaglandins, in addition to inhibiting HC1 secretion, act on a mucosal cell population which is different from parietal cells and that these cells secrete cytoprotective substances (mucin, glycosaminoglycans). The ulcerogenic effects of prostaglandin inhibitors (indomethacin, acetylsalicylic acid) apparently result from inhibition of this protective effect of endogenous prostaglandins.",

In the dog, gastric juice is produced in the resting state at a rate of approximately 5 ml/hour (Gray and B\u00fbcher, 1941) , and the composition is similar to that of the basal component, containing practi cally no peptic activity or hydrochloric acid. When the flow of gastric juice is stimulated maximally, the dog may produce 80 ml or more per hour (Gray and B\u00fbcher, 1941) , and this secretion contains large amounts of peptic activity and hydrochloric acid. Sodium, which is the principal cation in the basal secretion, is replaced to a large extent by hydrogen ion. The concentration of potassium is similar in both basal and stimulated secretions and therefore remains relatively constant at various rates of flow. Hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen are secreted by separate mechanisms, but these appear to be closely linked under physiological conditions. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (Bachrach, 1953; Hirschowitz and Sachs, 1965) or intravenous injection of gastrin (Hirschowitz, 1966) increases pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid levels together. Other stimuli may affect the two processes differently. In the dog, for example, histamine infusion stimulates hydrochloric acid production maximally but inhibits pepsinogen secre tion (Abrams and Brooks, 1960; Hirschowitz, 1966; Ernas and Grossman, 1967) .",

The coagulated milk protein probably delays gastric emptying and increases the efficiency of protein digestion in young calves. d. Hydrochloric Acid. Hydrochloric acid is produced by the oxyntic cells. When the normal mucosa is stimulated, both chloride and hydrogen ions are secreted together, but current evidence suggests that H + and Cl\" are secreted by separate, closely coupled pump mechanisms. Small amounts of Cl~ are secreted continuously by the unstimulated parietal cells in the absence of H + secretion, and this mechanism is responsible for the relative negative charge of the resting mucosal surface. Hydrogen ion and Clsecretory systems may also be differentiated in vitro by the demonstration of hydrogen ion secretion in the absence of Cl~. A scheme for the secretion of hydrochloric acid is presented in Fig. 4 . For every H + secreted, an electron is removed. The electron ultimately is accepted by oxygen to form OH -, which is neutralized within the cell by H + from carbonic acid. The bicar bonate ion produced enters the venous blood, and this explains why the pH of gastric venous blood frequently is greater than that of arterial blood during hydrochloric acid secretion (Davenport, 1966) .",

Lithocholic acid is relatively insoluble and is not reabsorbed to any great extent (Gustafsson and Norman, 1962) . Deoxycholic acid is reabsorbed from the large intestine in significant quantities and is either rehydroxylated by the liver to cholic acid and excreted (Lindstedt and Samuelsson, 1959) or excreted as conjugated deoxycholic acid. The extent to which bacteria transform the primary bile acids depends on the nature of the diet, the composition of the intestinal microflora, and the influences which these and other factors have on intestinal motility (Gustafsson et al., 1966; Gustafsson and Norman, 1969a,b) .",

Chymotrypsinogen A is composed of 245 amino acid residues and has numerous structural similarities to trypsinogen. Activation of the chymotrypsinogen also occurs with cleavage of a single peptide bond. For a complete discussion of this subject, see the review by Keller (1968) . d. Lipase. The pancreas produces several lipolytic enzymes with different substrate specificities. The most important of these from a nutritional viewpoint is the lipase re sponsible for hydrolysis of dietary triglyc\u00e9ride. This enzyme has the unique property of requiring an oil-water interface for activity so that only emulsions can be effectively at tacked (Sarda and Desnuelle, 1958) . The principal products of lipolysis are glycerol, monoglycerides, and fatty acids. The monoglycerides and fatty acids accumulate at the oil-water interface and can inhibit enzyme activity. Their transfer from the interface to the aqueous phase is favored by the presence of sodium bicarbonate also secreted by the pancreas and by bile salts. Mattson and Volpenhein (1966) described two other carboxylic ester hydrolases in pancreatic juice. Both enzymes have an absolute requirement for bile salts, in contrast to glycerol ester hydrolase, which is actually inhibited by bile salts at pH 8. One of these enzymes is a sterol ester hydrolase responsible for hydrolysis of cholesterol esters. The other enzyme hydrolyzes various water-soluble esters. The two enzyme activities have been differentiated on the basis of stability and optimal pH.",

Immunoreactive motilin has been found in the enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum and jejunum of several species (Polak et al., 1975) and, by means of radioimmunoassay, motilin has been identified in the plasma of dogs (Dryburgh and Brown, 1975) . Motilin has been shown to stimulate pepsin output and motor activity of the stomach (Brown et al., 1971) and to induce lower esophageal sphincter contractions (Jennewein et al., 1975) . Studies by Itoh et al., (1978) suggest that motilin plays an important role in initiating interdigestive gastrointestinal contractions. Somatostatin, which is named for its growth hormone release-inhibiting activity, was first purified from bovine hypothalamus (Brazlua and Guilleman, 1974) . Somatostatin also has been demonstrated in the stomach, pancreas, and intestinal mucosa in concen trations higher than in the brain (Pearse et al., 1977) . Somatostatin is a potent inhibitor of insulin and glucagon release. It also inhibits gastrin release and gastric acid secretion (Barros D'Sa et al., 1975; Bloom et al., 1974) , apparently acting independently on parietal cells and on G cells. These and a variety of other physiological effects suggest that somatostatin has important gastrointestinal regulatory functions (Pearse et al., 1977) .",

The effect of solvent drag on the transport of a given solute depends on the rate of volume flow and upon the reflection coefficient, which is an expression of the relationship between the pore radius and the radius of solute molecule being transported.

This enzyme is inhibited by cardiac glycosides, such as oubain, which also are effective inhibitors of Na + transport, and it has been suggested that this enzyme system may actually be the pump. In the jejunum, net absorption of sodium occurs slowly unless nonelectrolytes, such as glucose or amino acids, are absorbed simultaneously. In in vivo studies by Fordtran et al. (1968) , jejunal absorption of sodium appeared to be explained, in part, by solvent drag which was associated with active glucose transport. In the ileum, Na + absorption was independent of glucose absorption. Water absorption in the jejunum also appears to be almost entirely dependent upon the absorption of glucose, while absorption from the ileum is unaffected by glucose (Barry et al., 1961) . The differential effect of glucose on absorption from the jejunum and ileum appears to be the result of fundamental metabolic differences between these two areas of the intestine (Curran, 1960; Gilman and Koelle, 1960) .",

The question of whether water is actively or passively transported has been the subject of considerable controversy, and the controversy itself points to the fundamental difficulties which arise in trying to establish a definition of active transport. Hypertonie saline so lutions can be absorbed from canine intestine in vivo (Grim, 1962) and from canine and rat (Parsons and Wingate, 1961) intestine in vitro. These observations indicate that water absorption can occur against an activity gradient and that the process is dependent upon metabolic energy. This would suggest that an active transport process is involved. Curran (1965) , however, presents an alternate interpretation which is now generally accepted. This view is that water transport occurs secondarily to active solute transport and is the result of local gradients established within the mucosal membrane. Water transport is then coupled to the energy-dependent process responsible for solute transport but is one step removed from it.",

Regardless of whether monosaccharides originate in the lumen of the intestine or are formed at the surface of the mucosal cell, transport across the mucosa involves processes which have a high degree of chemical specificity. Glucose and galactose are absorbed from the intestine more rapidly than other monosaccharides. Fructose is absorbed at approximately one-half of the rate of glucose, and mannose is absorbed at less than one-tenth the rate of glucose (Kohn et al., 1965) . Glucose and galactose can be absorbed against concentration gradients and are said, by definition, to be actively transported. Active absorption requires metabolic energy and can be inhibited by a variety of substances which block oxidative phosphorylation.",

Both D-xylose, which has no substituted carbon atom at C-5, and D-mannose, which lacks the appropriate hydroxyl configuration at C-2, can be transported against concentration gradients under proper experimental conditions (Cs\u00e2ky and Lassen, 1964; Cs\u00e2ky and Ho, 1966; Alvarado, 1966b) .",

Cs\u00e2ky (1963) interprets the apparent coupling of sodium transport to the transport of various nonelectrolytes as being due to the need to maintain a critical intracellular sodium concentration, which, in turn, is essential for conversion of metabolic energy (ATP, etc.) to energy for transport.",

Because of the relative lack of specificity of the pepsins, some peptide bonds of almost all dietary proteins are split during passage through the stomach.

Most neonatal animals absorb significant amounts of immunoglubin and other colostral protein, but this capacity is lost soon after birth (see Section III,A,4 below). The intestinal mucosa is not totally impermeable to large polypeptide molecules, however. The absorption of insulin (MW 5700) (Laskowski et al., 1958; Danforth and Moore, 1959) , ribonuclease (MW 13,700) (Alpers and Isselbacher, 1967), territin (Bockman and Winborn, 1966) , and horseradish peroxidase (Cor nell et al., 1971 ) has been demonstrated. The intestine produces a part of the plasma /3-globulin. This is believed to be the result of de novo synthesis of protein, however, presumably from individual amino acid precursors.",

The hypothet ical mechanism involves the noncovalent binding of extracellular amino acids to the plasma membrane, while intracellular glutathione interacts with GGT to yield a \u03b3-glutamyl enzyme. When the \u03b3-glutamyl moiety is transferred to the membrane-bound amino acid, a \u03b3-glutamyl-amino acid complex is formed and, when released from the membrane binding site, moves into the cell. The \u03b3-glutamyl-amino acid complex is split by the action of \u03b3-glutamylcyclotransferase, an enzyme appropriately located in the cytosol. Glutathione is regenerated by means of the \u03b3-glutamyl cycle, which are good substrates for GGT (Thompson and Meister, 1975) . The \u03b3-glutamyl cycle does not require sodium, and the previously demonstrated sodium dependence for amino acid transport would not be explained by the cycle. The cycle is not considered to be the only amino acid transport system, and its quantitative significance in individual tissues is unknown.

Most calves deprived of colostrum develop septicemia early in life but may develop diarrhea before death (Smith, 1962; Roberts et al., 1954; Wood, 1955; Tennant et al, 1975) . Hypogammaglobulinemia is almost always demonstrable in calves dying of gramnegative bacterial septicemia (Fey, 1971) , and hypogammaglobulinemia is believed to be due to insufficient immunoglobulin intake or to insufficient intestinal absorption. The factor in colostrum that protects against systemic infections is the IgM fraction (Penhaie et al, 1971) .",

Most hypogammaglobulinemic individuals probably had insufficient colostrum intake. Even when calves were given the opportunity to ingest colostrum, a surprising number were hypogammaglobulinemic. Some of the reasons for varying gammaglobulinemia values are recognized, but the relative importance of each reason is not known. The concentration of lactoglobulin, the volume consumed (Bush et al, 1971; Selman et al, 1971 ) , the time elapsed from birth to ingestion of colostrum , and the method of ingestion (natural suckling versus bucket feeding) may have an important influence on the serum \u03b3-globulin (Smith et al, 1967; McBeath et al, 1971) . Calves that suckle their dams usually attain serum \u03b3-globulin concentrations that are higher than those attained by calves given colostrum from a bucket. The frequency of hypogamma globulinemia may be influenced by seasons (Gay et al., 1965b; McEwan et al., 1970a) , although this relationship has not always been observed (Smith et al., 1961; Thornton et al., 1972) . Familial factors also influence hypogammaglobulinemia (Tennant et al., 1969a) .",

The process is not selective because many proteins other than the immune globulins can be absorbed (Payne and Marsh, 1962a,b) . The ability to absorb intact protein is lost by domestic species within 1 or 2 days following birth. In rodents, protein absorption normally continues for approximately 3 weeks. The mechanism of intestinal \"closure\" was studied by Lecce and co-workers (1964; Lecce, 1966 ; Lecce and Morgan, a Samples of serum were obtained at birth, but no follow-up of calves was made. 0 The death rate of calves that were test negative was significantly (P < 0.01) greater than that of testpositive calves, using t test for significance of differences between two percentages. 1962). They found that complete starvation of pigs lengthened the period of protein absorption to 4-5 days, whereas early feeding shortened the period. Feeding different fractions of colostrum including lactose and galactose resulted in loss of protein absorptive capacity. The route of feeding may not be the critical factor, however. Calves prevented from eating but which receive nutrients parenterally lose the ability to absorb protein at the same time as control calves (Deutsch and Smith, 1957).",

The initial step in utilization of triglyc\u00e9rides occurs in the lumen of the proximal small intestine, where hydrolysis is catalyzed by pancreatic lipase. This enzyme, which is secreted in active form, requires an oil-water interface for activity so that only emulsions are attacked (Sarda and Desnuelle, 1958) . Enzyme activity is directly related to the surface area of the emulsion. The smaller the emulsion particle, the greater the total surface area of a given quantity of triglyc\u00e9ride and the greater the rate of hydrolysis (Benzonana and Desnuelle, 1965) . Bile salts are not an absolute requirement, but they favor hydrolysis (1) by their detergent action, which causes formation of emul sions with small particle sizes, and (2) by stimulating lipase activity within the physiologi cal pH range of the duodenum (Borgstr\u00f6m, 1954 (Borgstr\u00f6m, , 1964a .",

Both compounds are relatively insoluble in water but are brought rapidly into micellar solution by the detergent action of bile salts. The mixed micelles so formed have a diameter of approximately 2.0 nm (Borgstr\u00f6m, 1964b; Laurent and Persson, 1965) and are believed to be the form in which the products of fat digestion are actually taken up by the mucosal cell (Hofmann and Small, 1967) . The intraluminal events which occur in fat absorption are schematically summarized in Fig. 8. b. Mucosal Phase. The initial step in fat transport is the uptake of fatty acids and monoglycerides by the mucosal cell from micellar solution. Just how this occurs is not completely clear, but present evidence suggests that the lipid contents of the micelle are somehow discharged at the cell surface so that they enter the cell in molecular rather than micellar form . The net effect is the absorption of the end products of lipolysis with the exclusion of bile salts, which are absorbed farther down the intestine, primarily in the ileum (Lack and Weiner, 1963) . Uptake of fatty acids appears to be a passive process having no requirement for metabolic energy (Johnston and Borgstr\u00f6m, 1964; Strauss, 1966) .",

The two biochemical pathways for triglyc\u00e9ride biosynthesis in the intestine are summarized in Fig. 9 . Direct acylation of monoglyceride occurs in the intestine (Senior and Isselbacher, 1962) and probably is the major pathway for lipogenesis in the intestine during normal fat absorption (Kern and Borgstr\u00f6m, 1965; Mattson and Volpenhein, 1964) . The initial step in this series of reactions involves activation of fatty acids by acyl-CoA synthetase, a reaction which requires Mg 2+ , ATP, and CoA (Dawson and Isselbacher, 1960; Clark and H\u00fcbscher, 1960, 1961; Brindley and H\u00fcbscher, 1965 ) and which has a marked specificity for long-chain fatty acids (Dawson and Isselbacher, 1960; Brindley and H\u00fcbscher, 1965) . This specificity appears to explain the observation by Bloom et al. (1951) that mediumand short-chain fatty acids are not incorporated into triglyc\u00e9rides during intestinal trans port but enter the portal circulation as nonesterified fatty acids. The activated fatty acids (From Isselbacher, 1966.) then react sequentially with mono-and diglycerides to form triglyc\u00e9rides in steps catalyzed by mono-and diglyceride transacylases (Ailhaud et al., 1964) . The enzymes responsible for this series of reactions were partially purified by Rao and Johnston (1966) from the microsomal fraction of the cell. They observed that purification of the separate enzyme activities occurred simultaneously, suggesting that these enzymes occur together in the endoplasmic reticulum as a \"triglyceride-synthetase\" complex.",

Activated fatty acid CoA derivatives react with L-a-glycerophosphate to form lysophosphatidic acid (monoglyceride phosphate), which by a second acylation forms phosphatidic acid (diglyceride phosphate). Phosphatidic acid phosphatase then hydrolyzes the phosphate ester bond, forming diglyceride, and by means of a transacylase step similar to that described in the previous paragraph, triglyc\u00e9ride can then be formed. Although this pathway appears to be one of minor importance for triglyc\u00e9ride synthesis in the intestine, Johnston (1968) pointed out the importance of certain of the intermediates in this sequence of reactions in the synthesis of phospholipids which are necessary for stabilization of the chylomicron.",

Gastric secretions contain significant quantities of K + (Section II,B), and losses in the vomitus also contribute to the K + deficiency. Potassium deficiency, which develops initially because of alkalosis, ultimately may perpetuate the alkalotic state by interfering with the ability of the kidney to conserve H + (Koch et al., 1956; Darrow, 1964) .

In cattle, sheep, and goats, the physiological process of rumination utilizes neuromuscular mechanisms similar to those involved in vomiting. Uncontrolled expulsion of ruminai contents is, however, an uncommon sign, occurring most frequently after ingestion of toxic materials. The contents of the abomasum are not expelled directly even when the pyloric canal is obstructed. A syndrome does occur in cattle with pyloric obstruction, however, which is similar metabolically to that observed in nonruminants. The syndrome has been observed in right-sided displacement of the abomasum with torsion (Espersen, 1961; Boucher and Abt, 1968) . We have also observed the syndrome in cows with functional pyloric obstruction, the result of reticuloperitonitis (a variety of \"vagai indigestion\"). When the pylorus is obstructed, abomasal contents are retained, causing distention of the abomasum, which in turn stimulates further secretion and reten tion. Retained abomasal contents may be regurgitated into the large reservoir of the rumen and there are sequestered from other fluid compartments of the body. The net result is loss of H + and Cl\" ions and development of metabolic alkalosis, hypochloremia, and hypokalernia (Espersen and Simesen, 1961; Svendsen, 1969) .",

Rapid advances in understanding the pathogenesis of enterotoxin-induced diarrhea and the molecular basis of enterotoxin action have been made. The most extensively studied enterotoxin is that produced by Vibrio cholerae. This bacterium produces a large molecular weight heat-labile toxin (CT), one subunit of which has properties similar to those of heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin produced by certain strains of E. coli (Richards and Douglas, 1978) . The mechanism of action of CT is believed to Moon, 1978.) involve the activation of adenylate cyclase. This membrane-bound enzyme converts ATP to cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is then responsible for the greatly increased secretion of water and electrolytes by the intestinal mucosa (Moon, 1978) . Although species differences have been observed (Hamilton et al., 1978a,b; Forsyth et al., 1978) , this mechanism appears to be important in the mode of action of E. coli LT as well (Richards and Douglas, 1978) .",

The lack of speci ficity and the toxicity of cycloheximide precluded its clinical use, but acetazolamide has been shown to inhibit intestinal fluid secretion (Norris et al., 1969; Moore et al., 1971) , and ethacrynic acid, another potent diuretic, has been shown to inhibit enterotoxininduced fluid secretion (Carpenter et al., 1969) . Unfortunately, the diuretic effects of these drugs preclude their clinical use, but an \"intestinal-specific\" derivative would have significant therapeutic potential.

Application of either to the mucosa inhibits sodium absorption and stimulates chloride secretion. One possible explanation for the effects of CT is that it stimulated release of prostaglandin, which then acted on adenylate cyclase, producing cAMP. To test this hypothesis, the effects of inhibitors of prostaglandin release on enterotoxin-stimulated intestinal secretion were investigated. Both indomethacin (Gots et al., 1974) and acetylsalicylic acid (Farris et al., 1976) were shown to be potent inhibitors of enterotoxininduced intestinal secretion using laboratory animal models. Current evidence does not support the hypothesis that prostaglandins play a primary role in the pathogenesis of cholera or other enterotoxin-induced diarrheal diseases (Schwartz et al., 1975) , but the effects of these known prostaglandin inhibitors and other drugs on the intestinal secretory process warrant their evaluation as possible prophylactic and therapeutic agents. In pre liminary studies, Jones and his colleagues demonstrated a positive therapeutic response to a new prostaglandin inhibitor (Jones et al., 1977) . The autonomie nervous system has important effects on intestinal ion transport and water absorption (Tapper et al., 1978) . Catecholamines stimulate formation of cAMP in a variety of mammalian cells (Sutherland and Rail, 1960; Schultz et al., 1975) , apparently by activating the GTP-GDP system described above (Cassel and Selinger, 1978; Ciment and deVellis, 1978) . Adrenergic blocking agents, such as chlorpromazine (Holmgren et al., 1978) and propranolol (Donowitz et al., 1979) , have been shown to have significant inhibitory effects on enterotoxin-induced intestinal secretion. Although the mechanism of action of these two adrenergic blockers is not known, they represent still another class of drugs which may be of therapeutic benefit.",

The mechanism of action in inhibiting intestinal secretion has not been determined, but the chemical relation of bismuth subsalicylate to other known prostaglandin inhibitors is recognized. It is possible that such drugs, by decreasing endogenous production of prostaglandin, decrease the basal level of cyclic nucleotides, which in turn causes an increase in the threshold of response to enterotoxin.

The electrolyte composition of the stool in such cases is similar to that of the fluid found normally in the lumen of the small intestine, which in turn is similar to that of an ultrafiltrate of the plasma. The rapid dehydration which accompanies acute enteritis in the newborn soon produces hemoconcentration and ultimately hypovolemic shock. Such cases are characterized by metabolic acidosis (Dalton et al., 1965; Phillips and Knox, 1969) caused by decreased excretion of H + due to renal failure and by in creased production of organic acids, the result of decreased tissue oxyg\u00e9nation, which leads to excessive anaerobic glycolysis. Hyperkalemia also is observed characteristically in young, severely dehydrated animals. Hyperkalemia in such cases is the result of increased movement of cellular potassium into the extracellular fluid and to decreased renal excretion. Cardiac irregularities caused by hyperkalemia can be demonstrated with the electrocardiogram, and cardiac arrest related to hyperkalemia is believed to be a direct cause of death in calves with acute diarrhea Fisher and McEwan, 1967b) . Marked hypoglycemia also has been observed occasionally prior to death in calves with acute enteric infections. Hypoglycemia is believed to be due to decreased gluconeogenesis and increased anaerobic glycolysis, the result of hypovolemic shock (Tennant et al., 1968) . The sequence of metabolic changes which occur during acute neonatal diarrhea is summarized in Fig. 12 .",

In such cases, the osmolarity of the plasma is significantly decreased and hypotonie dehydration occurs.

Subsequent reports of malabsorption syndromes in the dog have described a variety of causes (Van Kruiningen, 1968; Ewing, 1971; Van Kruiningen andHayden, 1972; Hill, 1972; Hill and Kelly, 1974; Schall, 1974; Anderson, 1975 Anderson, , 1977 Burrows et al., 1979) , which must be distinguished from the maldigestion caused by pancreatic insufficiency (Anderson and Low, 1965a,b) (juvenile pancreatic atrophy, chronic pancreatitis) and from certain forms of hepatic or gastric disease. Intestinal malab sorption can occur with protozoal enteritis (giardiasis, coccidiosis), lactase deficiency, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, lymphangiectasis, villus atrophy, lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis, histoplasmosis, chronic \"bacterial\" enteritis, malignant lymphoma, and intesti nal amyloidosis of the bowel.

The stools are bulky, gray or tan, and, grossly, may have an oily appearance. The normal dog excretes 3-5 gm of fat in the stool each day. This level of fecal fat is quite constant and is independent of dietary fat intake over a wide range of 15 to 48 gm/day (Heersma and Annegers, 1948) . In intestinal malabsorption, the ability to absorb fat is decreased and fecal fat excretion increases significantly. Under these conditions, the amount of fecal fat excreted becomes proportional to dietary intake. Merritt et al. (1979) reported that body weight is an important factor in fat output. Small dogs (i.e., less than 10-15 kg body weight) with intestinal malabsorption had fecal fat outputs lower than or equal to published normal values. Fecal fat excretion for normal dogs was 0.24 \u00b1 0.01 gm/kg body weight per day.",

For neutral fat, two drops of water are added to a stool sample on a glass slide and mixed. Two drops of 95% ethanol are then added and mixed followed by several drops of a saturated solution of Sudan III in 95% ethanol. A coverslip is applied to the mixture, which is then examined for yellow or pale orange refractile globules of fat, particularly at the edges of the coverslip.

The anemia some times observed may be the result of malabsorption of iron or of the B vitamins, which are required for normal erythropoiesis. Malabsorption of vitamin K can result in hypoprothrombinemia. Glucose malabsorption has been clearly documented by Kaneko et al. (1965) , and it is likely that amino acids, which are absorbed at a similar level of the small intestine, are also malabsorbed. Carbohydrate and fat malabsorption unquestionably con tributes to the calorie deficit which results in weight loss.

The most simple and perhaps most widely used test to differentiate intestinal malabsorption from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is that described by Jasper (1954) . The test is employed to detect reduction in trypsin-like activity in the feces of dogs with decreased pancreatic exocrine secretion (Grossman, 1962) . There is wide variation in normal activity, making interpretation of the test difficult (Frankland, 1969; Hill and Kidder, 1970; Burrows et al., 1979) . The test reveals only the presence or absence of hydrolysis of gelatin and does not differentiate between gelatinase activity produced by intestinal bacteria from that secreted by the pancreas. There is evidence in some species that trypsin is almost completely destroyed by bacteria during its passage through the intestine and that the proteinase activity of the feces is primarily of bacterial origin (Borgstr\u00f6m et al., 1959) . Despite these theoretical objections, the test has been of clinical diagnostic value in our hands. Fecal gelatinase activity has been detected consistently in cases of intestinal malabsorption and is almost always absent when severe pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is present. Burrows et al. (1979) reported that the mean 24-hour trypsin output in dogs with pancreatic insufficiency was significantly lower, and in dogs with malabsorption significantly higher, than clinically normal dogs.",

The absorption of glucose can be measured by means of an oral glucose tolerance test in which a test dose of glucose is given by mouth and the blood glucose level measured at intervals for 3-4 hours following administration. The test has been used in canine malabsorption in which the normal rise in blood glucose level is reduced (Kaneko et al., 1965) . The test also has been reported for use in the horse (Roberts and Hill, 1973) . Dogs with pancreatic exocrine deficiency may, however, have \"diabetic\" tolerance curves (Hill and Kidder, 1972b) . The major disadvantage of relying on this test alone is that it does not differentiate between decreased intestinal absorption and increased tissue uptake following absorption. This problem can be minimized by comparing results of the oral glucose tolerance test with those obtained with the intraven ous tolerance test. The results of this test, however, must be interpreted carefully and in relation to other clinical and laboratory findings. Hill and Kidder (1972) reported that dogs on low-carbohydrate diets can have \"diabetic\" tolerance curves; test dogs should be on a high-carbohydrate diet 3-5 days before testing.",

At the end of the 5-hour test period, the urine remaining in the bladder is removed by catheter, and the total quantity excreted in 5 hours is determined. Normal dogs excreted an average of 12.2 gm during the test period, with a range of 9.1-16.5 gm.

Dogs are fasted overnight, a blood sample is obtained, and D-xylose is administered by stomach tube at the rate of 0.5 gm/kg. A control test is performed on a normal dog simultaneously with each dog with signs of intestinal malab sorption. The first blood sample is obtained one-half hour after administration. The second sample is obtained 1 hour following administration, and additional samples are taken at hourly intervals for 5 hours. The xylose concentration in the blood is determined by the method of Roe and Rice (1948) . Maximal blood levels almost always are reached at 1 hour after administration of the test dose; Hill expects a xylose level of at least 45 mg/dl within 60-90 minutes in a normal dog. In preliminary studies of four dogs with the malabsorption syndrome, maximal blood xylose levels averaged 58% of corresponding control values. In dogs with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with normal intestinal mucosa, there should be a normal xylose response test. The D-xylose absorption test also has been described for use in differential diagnosis of equine diarrheal diseases (Roberts, 1974) . Bolton et al. (1976) reported that a dosage of 0.5 gm xylose per kilogram body weight was useful in detecting horses that absorbed the pentose abnormally. Gastrointesti nal lesions associated with abnormal results were classified as (1) villous atrophy, (2) edema of the lamina propria, or (3) necrosis of the lamina propria. At this dosage in normal horses, the mean peak plasma concentration is less than one-third that seen in normal dogs given xylose (normal dogs: 60-70 mg % at 60 minutes).",

Because protein usually undergoes complete degradation within the intestinal lumen, it has been suggested that the gastrointestinal tract must have a physiological role in the catabolism of plasma proteins.

Some investigators have concluded that as much as 50% or more of the normal catabolism of albumin (Glenert et al., 1961 Campbell et al., 1961; Wetterfors, 1964 Wetterfors, , 1965 Wetterfors et al., 1965) and \u03b3-globulin occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. Others believed that the physiological role of the intestine in plasma protein catabolism is far less significant, accounting for only about 10% of the total catabolism (Waldmann et al., 1967 (Waldmann et al., , 1969 Katz et al., 1960; Franks et al., 1963a,b) .",

This has been accomplished with certain nonionic detergents with surfac tant properties which break up or prevent formation of foam within the rumen (Bartley, 1965) . Another approach has been the prophylactic administration of sodium alkyl sulfonate, which inhibits pectin methyl esterase activity, preventing foam formation by eliminating the products of this enzyme reaction (Nichols, 1963) . Much effort is now being directed toward genetic selection of cattle which are less susceptible to rumen tympany and to varieties of legumes which are less likely to produce bloat (Howarm, 1975) .",

Clinical manifestations are the result of excessive ammonia production (Word et al., 1969; Elmer and Barclay, 1971) and are due to the encephalotoxic effects of free ammonia absorbed from the rumen. Tolerance to urea may be significantly increased by gradually elevating the amounts of urea in the diet or by adding readily fermentable carbohydrate. It has actually been possible for ruminants to adapt and thrive on a diet in which urea was the sole source of dietary nitrogen. However, if urea is fed at a level of more than 3% in the diet of unadapted animals, toxic effects are likely. Poisoning may occur when, by accident, animals obtain access to large amounts of urea-containing dietary supplement or in animals receiving bulk feed when there has been an error in formulation or when the urea-containing additive is incompletely mixed. Oral administration of acetic acid has been shown to reduce acute urea toxicity, apparently by decreasing absorption of free ammonia from the rumen. Acetic acid also has been used clinically for the treatment of urea poisoning but under experimental conditions it has more value prophylactically than in animals with frank signs of poisoning (Word et al., 1969) .",
