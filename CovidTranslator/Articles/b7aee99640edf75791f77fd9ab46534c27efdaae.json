Compared with the global burden of disease, human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS and hepatitis C trials were overrepresented, and lower respiratory tract infection trials were underrepresented. Hepatitis C trials fluctuated, keeping with a wave of new drug development. Influenza vaccine trials peaked during the 2009 H1N1 swine influenza outbreak.",

As with the 2007-2010 snapshot, we examined trial methods and funding source, with a new emphasis on analyzing trends over time. We also evaluated the alignment between current clinical research priorities and the disease burden of IDs in the United States and abroad. In addition, we provided a more detailed analysis of hepatitis C trials given the significant changes in hepatitis C management over the past decade. METHODS We performed a systematic analysis of characteristics of ID trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2017. We chose ClinicalTrials.gov for our analysis because it was used for the 2007-2010 snapshot and, as described elsewhere, it is among the largest trial repositories, has comprehensive data fields, and has established methods for data download [1] . Although ClinicalTrials.gov is not the most comprehensive database of clinical trials (compared with the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), it is an accurate reflection of clinical trials being conducted in IDs and is amenable to aggregate analysis [1] . Moreover, a comprehensive review of ID trials has not been completed since the initial snapshot, although reviews have been published of respiratory tract infection trials, HIV and hepatitis C trials, and pediatric antibacterial and antifungal trials [6] [7] [8] . The 10 years of clinical trials examined in this study include trials submitted to comply with requirements for publication in peer-reviewed medical journals and trials registered under the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 and other regulatory requirements [9] .",

The representation of these selected subcategories within the ClinicalTrials.gov ID data set was compared with global and United States ID-related deaths and DALYs (as defined by the WHO Global Burden of Disease) and is shown in Figure 2 . Hepatitis C trials accounted for 8.7% of ID trials registered from 2007-2017. This was similar to the hepatitis C virus-associated morbidity rate in the United States (6.3%) but higher than the global hepatitis C virus-associated morbidity rate (0.7%). Similarly, trials of HIV/ AIDS, hepatitis B, and sexually transmitted disease excluding HIV were overrepresented compared with both global and US burden of disease, whereas LRTI trials were underrepresented. Notably, diarrheal disease and tuberculosis trials were underrepresented compared with the global burden of disease (4.1% vs 16.7%, and 3.5% vs 11.0%, respectively). Hepatitis C trials were selected for additional scrutiny owing to the considerable advancements in hepatitis C treatment over the 10-year study period [16] . Hepatitis C trials tended to be more focused on treatment (89.0%) and specifically drug intervention (89.1%) than the rest of the ID trials (54.5%). They were also more likely to be funded by industry (72.0% vs 40.5%). Hepatitis C trials registered by year were pooled by phase as follows: early phase 1 trials were considered to be phase 1, phase 1/phase 2 trials were considered phase 2, and phase 2/ phase 3 trials were considered phase 3. The distribution of the phases of hepatitis C trials is presented in Figure 4 , along with key dates for these drugs, including date of first registration in ClinicalTrials.gov and date of FDA approval [17] [18] [19] [20] . As these new hepatitis C drugs entered into clinical testing, there is a phase shift evident in the trial phase, which begins with a predominance of phase 1, then advancing through the subsequent phases over time. Funding sources for hepatitis C trials per year are shown in Figure 4B . In general, industry funding plateaued in study years 2011 and 2012, with industry being the primary funding source for >80% of trials and dropping to 52.9% of studies by 2011. NIH funding fluctuated, but the NIH was the main funder for <10% of hepatitis C trials for all study years.",

Although originally intended to be a portal that links clinical trials to the general public, it also serves as a useful tool to understand the clinical trial landscape. Several analyses of the registry have been published, focusing on overall trial characteristics, disease-specific characteristics, and compliance with results reporting. among other areas [5, 21, 22] . We previously used this database to characterize the landscape of ID trials, although that analysis was limited to the first 3 years (2007-2010) after registration of interventional trials became legally mandatory. Now that a decade of ClinicalTrials.gov data after FDA Amendments Act registration mandates are available, there is an opportunity to reanalyze the ID research landscape. Compared with our prior analysis of 2007-2010 trial data, many characteristics remained relatively unchanged [1] . This is largely because of qualities inherent to IDs. For example, there was a strong emphasis on prevention-focused trials. Similarly, the importance of vaccine-based interventions persisted. ID trials also restricted trials to children at a much higher rate than non-ID trials, potentially owing to the focus on prevention and vaccination within the field. This may be due to the greater burden of certain IDs in children. This predilection of IDs for the young partially, but not entirely, explains the higher rate of exclusion for elderly subjects. The exclusion of elderly subjects in the HIV/AIDS, influenza vaccine, tuberculosis, and malaria categories may limit the generalizability of some trials within these categories.",

ID trials also tended to be larger than non-ID trials. Certain disease categories, such as malaria, had much larger trials than other ID categories. Consequently, the number of trials in a category is not always a good proxy for the extent of work being done on a particular disease. Although some disease categories did have a higher median number of enrolled subjects per trial, total enrollment numbers for some categories were skewed by the presence of large trials (\u226510 000) patients, which tended to be long-term postmarketing surveillance trials. Our analysis also found that, in the case of hepatitis C, drug and therapy development seems to follow anticipated patterns and funding sources. Hepatitis C presented a unique opportunity to observe the evolution of clinical trials research as new treatments became available. Predictably, trials progressed from earl-y to late-phase designs as new directly acting antiviral drugs moved through development and validation. Industry funding, the primary source of funding for these and most ID studies, tracked closely with the number of late-phase studies, indicating the large extent to which industry funding was the driving force behind hepatitis C research during this period. The new drug classes took 4-6 years to progress through the clinical research pipeline, with the first 2 years focused on earlyphase trials. It is worth noting that hepatitis C trials were found to be overrepresented in the ID trial data set compared with global morbidity and mortality rates. Considering that the parallel development of multiple drug interventions was occurring at essentially the same time, it is possible some of the overrepresentation of hepatitis C could have been averted through greater collaboration of industry, funding sources, and researchers. Platform trials, such as the Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response With Imaging And molecular Analysis 2 (I-SPY 2) model for breast cancer, could have been an ideal opportunity to streamline evaluation of these various new hepatitis C therapies [23] .",

Influenza vaccine trials exhibited a distinct spike in the number of clinical trials in study years 2008 and 2009, corresponding to the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic worldwide [24] . Hemorrhagic virus trials had a distinct spike in 2014-2015, corresponding to the 2014-2016 Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic in Western Africa [25] . Interestingly, the first Ebola case was reported in March 2014, just 6 months before the registration of several Ebola clinical trials. This is a relatively short time from the recognition of a need for clinical research, securing funding for that research, and initiation of the clinical trial [25] . A similar trend was observed with Zika trials, which also were registered only in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to the onset of that outbreak [26] . Despite extensive research on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus during 2007-2017, there were very few (n = 3) interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov pertaining to these infections. This is probably because the registry and our analysis focuses on interventional trials, whereas many studies of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus were observational and were therefore not required to register.",

Second, the FDA requirement for registration applies to interventional trials of FDA-regulated drug and biologic products and devices.

The number of trials registered per year remained steady for hepatitis B and malaria. There was a 64.0% increase in influenza vaccine studies in 2008 compared with 2007. This increase was sustained for 2 years and then declined to prior levels, where it remained stable. A 4.7-fold increase in hemorrhagic virus trials was observed in study year 2014. Ebola trials made up 32 (68.1%) of the 47 hemorrhagic virus trials registered from October 2014 through September 2015. No Zika virus trials were registered before 2015; 1 was registered in study year 2015, and 8 in 2016. The number of HIV/AIDS trials registered in any given year fluctuated from 250 to 342 but overall remained similar over the 10-year study window.
