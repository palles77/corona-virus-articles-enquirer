            "text": "The objective of this research was to investigate the prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection primarily in dromedary camel farms and the relationship of those infections with infections in humans in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Nasal swabs from 1113 dromedary camels (39 farms) and 34 sheep (1 farm) and sputum samples from 2 MERS-CoVinfected camel farm owners and 1 MERS-CoV-infected sheep farm owner were collected. Samples from camels and humans underwent real-time reverse-transcription quantitative PCR screening to detect MERS-CoV. In addition, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partially characterized MERS-CoV genome fragments obtained from camels were performed. Among the 40 farms, 6 camel farms were positive for MERS-CoV; the virus was not detected in the single sheep farm. The maximum duration of viral shedding from infected camels was 2 weeks after the first positive test result as detected in nasal swabs and in rectal swabs obtained from infected calves. Three partial camel sequences characterized in this study (open reading frames 1a and 1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and ORF4b) together with the corresponding regions of previously reported MERS-CoV sequence obtained from one farm owner were clustering together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster containing human and camel isolates reported for the Arabian Peninsula. Data provided further evidence of the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV infection and strongly suggested that camels may have a role in the transmission of the virus to humans.",

Data from recent MERS-CoV outbreak investigations suggest that camels could be a source of human infections [2] . MERS-CoV sequences obtained from humans and camels in Oman, Qatar, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia revealed a close link between the virus detected in camels and that detected in people in the same geographic area [3] [4] [5] . However, the exact route of transmission from camels to humans remains unclear. MERS-CoV possible routes of transmission in humans and camels include camel-to-human, human-tohuman, camel-to-camel, and human-to-camel. [6] . It is worth noting that the presence of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein as a viral receptor suggests that not only dromedary camels, but also other animal species may be potential targets of this virus [7] .",

To date, no vaccine or specific treatment for MERS-CoV is available. However, a recent orthopoxvirus-based vaccine against MERS-CoV infection in camels has been developed. Vaccination of dromedary camels with this vaccine induced protective immunity resulting in reduction of excreted infectious MERS-CoV, without an evidence for antibody-dependent enhancement of viral replication [10] .",

The ORF1b gene region was also tested before being replaced by Orf1a [13, 14] . All assays were optimized by the use of a real-time 1-step RT-qPCR kit for analysis of viral RNA and cycling system (Roche Diagnostics). Positive results for both UpE and ORF1a assays were further confirmed by sequencing the RNAdependent RNA polymerase and nucleocapsid gene regions as well as sequencing 5 partial fragments (ORF1a, ORF1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and ORF4b genes) as previously described [15] .

Furthermore, two camels partial sequences derived from camel farm exhibited 99.9 % identity with the corresponding sequences derived from human who had a history of contact with camels in the same farm. This has provided evidence of potential zoonosis and suggests a common origin.",
