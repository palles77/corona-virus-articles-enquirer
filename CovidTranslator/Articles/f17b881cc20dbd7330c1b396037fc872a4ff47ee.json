Results: Plasma CIT (median [range]: 67.5 [61.9-75.4] vs 30.1 [15.0-56.1] \u03bcmol/L) and ARG (170.7 [148.5-219.5] vs 106.1 [54.4-190.7] \u03bcmol/L) were lower and plasma NO (4.42 [3.29-5.58] vs 6.78 [5.29-8.92] \u03bcM) and blood ammonia concentrations (28.7 [26.1-36.9] vs 59.8 [34.6-99.5] \u03bcmol/L) were higher in the neonatal calves with diarrhea (P < .001). Plasma CIT (\u03b2 = \u22120.29, P = .02), ARG (\u03b2 = \u22120.33, P = .01), NO (\u03b2 = 0.55, P < .001), and blood ammonia (\u03b2 = 0.63, P <.001) were affected by SIRS status. Except for ammonia (0.52), the effects sizes for severity of diarrhea and degree of dehydration were small (\u03b7p2 \u2264 0.45) for CIT, ARG, and NO.

Nonnormally distributed variables were log transformed for analysis or analyzed by nonparametric methods. The measurements were analyzed in total and separately by group with the groups formed by diarrhea etiology, severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and SIRS status. Diarrheic subgroups classified by the above mentioned criteria compared with age-matched healthy controls. For normally distributed data with or without transformation, Student's t test was used for comparisons between 2 groups (healthy controls vs all diarrheic calves), and 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test was performed for comparisons among 3 or more groups (healthy controls and diarrheic subgroups). For data not normally distributed even after transformation, comparisons among groups were made by nonparametric tests (2 groups: Mann-Whitney U-test; 3 or more groups: Kruskal-Wallis test). Friedman's test was used to determine for changes in plasma CIT, ARG, NO, and blood ammonia concentrations over time in the healthy control group. Regression analysis was performed to assess the associations among plasma CIT, ARG, and NO, and blood ammonia concentrations and potential explanatory variables, namely age of calf (day), the presence of SIRS (no = 0; yes = 1) and etiology of diarrhea (noninfectious = 0; infectious = 1) in the diarrheic calves. Initially, simple linear regression was performed. A multiple linear regression by backward method was then constructed, which initially included any variables identified as P value <.2 on univariable analysis. One-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine the influences of severity of diarrhea (mild = 0, moderate = 1, and severe = 2) and degree of dehydration (mild = 0, moderate = 1, and severe = 2) on plasma CIT and its related metabolites, after effect of the covariate, calf age, was controlled. Effect sizes were interpreted by Cohen's guidelines for the partial eta-squared (\u03b7p2) values. 31 Data were expressed as mean (deviation) or median (ranges) based on the results of the normality test. All analyses were considered statistically significant at P < .05. Table 1 .

[48] [49] [50] In this study, 50 of 60 diarrheic calves were evaluated as infectious. Similar to previous studies in humans 50 indicating NO formation, are well documented in patients with SIRS or sepsis, and this alteration contributes to intestinal damage and its consequences. 9 In the present study, significantly higher plasma NO concentration in diarrheic calves with SIRS can also be explained by a similar process ( Figure 4C ).",

            "text": "Ammonia is a toxic compound to many organ systems, especially the brain. Excessive blood ammonia concentration might result in respiratory alkalosis, cerebral edema, mental disorders, seizures, coma, and death. Increases in blood ammonia concentration are generally considered to only be a result of liver-related disorders, but other underlying causes should be assessed as well. 20 High blood ammonia levels can develop from several different mechanisms, including (1) hepatic insufficiency, (2) reduced activity of urea cycle enzymes, (3) metabolic disorders of organic acids, and (4) portosystemic shunt. 20 In the present study, blood ammonia concentration with a median of 59.8 \u03bcmol/L in diarrheic calves was significantly higher than that in healthy calves (Table 2 ). Although these median levels remained within the reference range (<90 \u03bcmol/L) reported for cattle, 40 median blood ammonia levels in the severe diarrhea (105.7 \u03bcmol/L), severe dehydration (113.9 \u03bcmol/L), and SIRS positive (105.7 \u03bcmol/L) subgroups were above the reference limits ( Figures 2D, 3D, and 4D ). This increase in these subgroups can be considered to be hyperammonemia and might be related to the loss of liver or kidney function because of circulatory failure in the result of diarrhea, as well as the decrease of plasma citrulline and arginine concentrations which decreases the efficiency of the urea cycle. In this content, hyperammonemia has also been reported in a human case of short bowel syndrome along with decreased concentrations of arginine and citrulline 54 and in systemic infections with bacteria or virus. 55 The moderate and positive relationship of blood ammonia with SIRS status (Table 3 ) and the effects of severity of diarrhea and degree of dehydration) might be based on the factors affecting urea cycle and ammonia metabolism. 20 The results of this study are subject to some limitations. This study included a variety of mono or combined causative agents (Table 1) with NCD in calves with noninfectious diarrhea cannot be determined because only the antigens of the most common enteropathogens in feces were evaluated. Additionally, the duration of disease is a confounding factor which could cause difficulty in diagnosis of noninfectious diarrhea. Lastly, the sample size of this study was small, especially in neonatal calves with noninfectious diarrhea.",

Plasma CIT concentrations could be a useful marker to evaluate the presence and degree of intestinal damage and gut barrier dysfunction in neonatal calves with acute diarrhea.

            "text": "blood collection. Blood samples were collected aseptically by jugular venipuncture (BD Vacutainer Blood Collection Tube, 5 mL, with K 2 EDTA or lithium heparin and without anticoagulant, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) for hematologic and biochemical evaluation. At the same time, jugular blood samples were taken anaerobically into lithium-heparinized 2 mL-syringe (BD Vacutainer, Eclips Arterial Blood Syringe) for blood gas analysis. Blood samples collected into lithium heparin-containing tubes and plain tubes were centrifuged at 1000g for 10 minutes for separation of plasma or serum. Complete blood cell count, blood gases, and ammonia assays were performed within 2 hours of sampling. Serum or plasma samples were evaluated visually for hemolysis and stored at \u221220 C until analysis for other biochemical assays. Stool specimens were collected in sterile stool storage containers in sufficient quantities. Complete blood cell count was conducted on an automated blood cell counter (Abacus Junior Vet 5, Diatron, Hungary). Blood gas and electrolyte analyses were performed at 37 C with an automated blood gas analyzer (Irma Trupoint, Lifehealth LLC, Littleton, Colorado). All blood gas analyses were corrected for the calf's rectal temperature. Selected serum biochemical tests (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), urea, creatinine, total protein, and albumin) were performed with an autoanalyzer (Chemray 120 Automated Analyzer, Rayto, China) using commercial test kits (Archem Diagnostics, Turkey). Quantitative analyses of plasma CIT and ARG concentrations were performed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) providing high sensitivity and specificity. 29 Commercial test kits for amino acid analyses (Amino acids, ImmuChrom GmbH, Germany) were used in this regard in accordance with the method of LC/MS/MS (QTRAP 4500, AB Sciex, Framingham, Massachusetts). The method was validated by determining the linearity, and interassay and intraassay precision and reproducibility. The intraassay and interassay coefficient of variation for amino acid concentrations were under 7 and 10%, respectively. Plasma NO concentration was determined by Griess reagent with a commercial test kit (Nitrate/Nitrite Colorimetric Assay Kit, Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, Michigan). Whole blood ammonia concentrations were measured with a point-of-care blood ammonia analyzer (Pocketchem BA, Arkray, Japan), which has been used in human and veterinary medicine. 30 The blood ammonia analyzer uses a micro diffusion method based on a colorimetric assay and 20 \u03bcL of K 2 EDTA whole blood sample.

The results indicated that neonatal calves with acute diarrhea have lower plasma CIT and ARG and higher plasma NO and blood ammonia concentrations than healthy calves, and that SIRS status, severity of diarrhea, and degree of dehydration significantly affect levels of plasma CIT and its related metabolites.The etiology of NCD is complex and includes a wide range of factors related to the animal, conditions of the environment and husbandry, and various infectious agents. The majority of NCD cases are caused by rotavirus, coronavirus, C. parvum or ETEC F5.[1][2][3][4] In field conditions, combinations of these agents frequently occur, 2,4 and the consequences of mixed infections often appear to be more severe",

These results could be explained by intestinal damage and increasing mucosal permeability with more severe inflammation in SIRS and diarrhea-induced dehydration by causative agents. Small bowel damage might be central in the development of SIRS and sepsis, thus low levels of CIT and ARG have been reported in adults and children with sepsis and other critical illness13,19,45,46 as well as in dogs.22,42 Because SIRS can affect gut function and integrity, alterations in glutamine metabolism might exist and lead to decreased CIT production. Significantly lower plasma CIT concentration in diarrheic calves with SIRS than that in diarrheic calves without SIRS might be in part a result of a defect in the metabolic conversion of glutamine to",

In agreement with the results of previous studies in humans with acute infectious gastroenteritis,53 plasma NO concentrations were significantly higher in calves with acute infectious diarrhea than in calves with noninfectious diarrhea and healthy calves (Figure 1C). The increases in plasma NO concentrations were greater in severe diarrhea (FS 3), severe dehydrated and SIRS positive subgroups, indicating also that severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and SIRS status influence the blood levels of NO(Figures 2C and 4C). Besides intestinal damage because of enteropathogens, dehydration might play a role in the acute phase response, thus increasing the induction of iNOS.47 Therefore, significantly higher plasma NO concentration might be possible in severely dehydrated diarrheic calves than those in mildly or moderately dehydrated calves, as well as healthy calves.
