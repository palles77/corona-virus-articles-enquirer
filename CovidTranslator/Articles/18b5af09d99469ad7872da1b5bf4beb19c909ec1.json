The high catalytic efficiency of ACE2 for the generation of angiotensin (ANG)-1-7 from ANG II suggests an important role of ACE2 in preventing ANG II accumulation, while at the same time enhancing ANG-1-7 formation. ACE and ACE2 may have counterbalancing functions and a regulatory role in fine-tuning the rate at which ANG peptides are formed and degraded. By counterregulating the actions of ACE on ANG II formation, ACE2 may play a role in maintaining a balanced status of the reninangiotensin system. This review focuses on the function of ACE2 and its possible roles in kidney disease and hypertension. Studies using models of ACE2 ablation and the pharmacologic administration of an ACE2 inhibitor suggest that decreased ACE2 activity alone or in combination with increased ACE activity may play a role in both diseases.",

The gene encoding ACE2 is located on the X chromosome. Like ACE, ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane protein; however, ACE2 contains only a single active site domain and consists of 805 amino acids [1, 2] . ACE2 acts as a carboxypeptidase, removing single amino acids from the C-terminus of its substrates, whereas ACE acts predominantly as a peptidyl dipeptidase removing C-terminal dipeptides. The metalloprotease catalytic domains of ACE2 and ACE are 41% identical, and comparison of the genomic structures indicates that the two genes arose through duplication from a common ancestor [1, 2] . The subsequent elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the extracellular domain of ACE2 [3] revealed that the catalytic mechanism of ACE2 closely resembles that of ACE. However, the substrate-binding pockets differ significantly [3] , explaining the differences in substrate specificity between the two enzymes and the failure of ACE inhibitors to bind to and inhibit ACE2 [4] .",

Collectrin, unlike ACE and ACE2, lacks carboxypeptidase catalytic properties and was initially localized in the collecting tubule [5] . More recently, however, it has been localized to the proximal tubule, where it is involved in regulating amino acid uptake [6\u2022,7] . Collectrin also has been suggested to have a role in cystogenesis by interacting with ciliaspecific membrane integral proteins [8\u2022] . Another gene has been identified in the genomes of several mammalian species that encodes a novel, single-domain ACE-like protein that was named ACE3. In several species ACE3 seems to lack catalytic activity as a zinc metalloprotease [9] . Moreover, in humans, no evidence could be found that the ACE3 gene is expressed, and the presence of deletions and insertions in the sequence suggests that in humans ACE3 is a pseudogene [9] .",

We first suggested that ACE2 could be renoprotective, particularly in combination with low levels of ACE [13] .

In this assay, mouse kidney samples are mixed with ANG II and incubated for a specified time. ACE2 converts ANG II to ANG-(1-7), which both can be quantified by SELDI-TOF MS.

For instance, using our fluorogenic assay the levels of ACE2 activity in mouse kidney cortex are about 10-to 20-fold higher than in the heart, whereas ACE2 activity is barely detectable in serum [16\u2022] . Studies using other measurement methods found very low or undetectable ACE2 activity in plasma from rodents [20\u2022,26] . Similarly, in healthy humans, the levels of circulating ACE2 are undetectable or very low [30] . Rice et al. [30] found that circulating ACE2 was 100-fold lower than ACE, and ACE2 was detectable in less than 10% of the study population. Low circulating ACE2 levels could result from less shedding of ACE2 as compared with ACE from the plasma membrane of endothelial cells [30] . The zinc metalloprotease ADAM17 is responsible for the regulated shedding of ACE2; there is little constitutive shedding of ACE2 as compared with ACE [31\u2022]. ACE2 activity and protein have been detected in human urine from healthy subjects [32\u2022] , and ACE2 activity has been measured in urine and serum from sheep [21\u2022 ]. Thus, ACE2, like ACE, appears to be secreted as a soluble protein in vivo. It would be important to determine whether circulating or urinary ACE2 increases in certain disease states, either due to increased expression, increased shedding from the membrane, or decreased clearance from the circulation [30] . The pattern of ACE and ACE2 expression in the glomerulus of db/db mice is just the opposite of what we find in cortical tubules [13] . Consequently, the final urine may not reflect the site of the nephron where the alteration primarily resides.",

This indicates that the level of functional activity is highly dependent on the level of protein expression. In contrast, we found a lack of positive correlation between renal ACE2 activity and renal ACE2 mRNA levels in the db/db as well as streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. These findings illustrate the importance of not relying solely on mRNA levels when assessing whether ACE2 is altered. Measurements of ACE2 mRNA alone may not reflect existing differences occurring at a posttranscriptional level [16\u2022] . Investigators must keep this in mind when interpreting data from studies reporting ACE2 gene polymorphisms in diseases such as hypertension or diabetes. This further underscores the importance of having reliable assays to measure ACE2 activity targeting the sites of possible ACE2 alterations in the kidney and other organs.",

In both kidney sections and cultured polarized renal epithelial cells, ACE2 localizes predominantly to apical surface [15\u2022\u2022,32\u2022] where it can undergo regulated proteolytic shedding [31\u2022] . ACE2 is also present in the glomerulus, although the level of expression in mouse kidneys is reduced as compared with renal tubules (see below). Li et al. [22\u2022\u2022] have systematically examined the relative distribution of ACE2 in the rat kidney at the mRNA level. In microdissected rat nephron segments, semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that ACE2 mRNA was widely expressed, with relatively high levels in the proximal straight tubule. The high level of ACE2 expression in the proximal tubule suggests that it may regulate the local levels of ANG II, and generate ANG-(1-7). In rats, ACE2 has been localized by immunohistochemistry to the proximal tubule [34] . Interestingly, ACE2 colocalizes with ANG- (1-7) , and the proximal tubular staining for ACE2 and ANG-(1-7) increases in normal pregnancy [34] . This correlated with increased urinary excretion of ANG-(1-7); however, ACE2 in urine was not measured [34] .",

We reasoned that in diabetic mice such a combination could foster renal injury by resulting either in ANG II accumulation, decreased ANG-(1-7) formation, or both [15\u2022\u2022] . To test this hypothesis, we used a specific ACE2 inhibitor, MLN-4760, to reduce ACE2 activity. The administration of MLN-4760 for 16 weeks exacerbated albuminuria in the db/db mice [15\u2022\u2022] . This was associated with increased glomerular expression of fibronectin. In a different model of diabetes (STZ-treated mice), Soler et al. [14\u2022\u2022] found both glomerular mesangial expansion and increased albumin excretion after MLN-4760 treatment. We further found that the glomerular expression of ACE was increased in STZ-treated mice and further increased after MLN-4760 administration [14\u2022\u2022] . As outlined in Figure 1 , changes in ACE and ACE2 can work in concert to regulate the level of angiotensin peptides. The scheme outlined in Figure 1 predicts that a pattern of low ACE and high ACE2 would lead to less ANG II and more ANG-(1-7) formation locally.",

In male mice with genetic ACE2 ablation, early accumulation of fibrillar collagen in glomerular mesangium was followed by the development of glomerulosclerosis by 12 months of age. Female ACE2 mutant (Ace2-/-) mice were relatively protected. Urinary albumin excretion was increased as compared with age-matched control mice [39\u2022\u2022] . These structural and functional changes in the glomeruli of male ACE2 mutant mice were prevented by treatment with the ANG II type 1 receptor antagonist irbesartan. The glomerular injury in male mice associated with the deletion of the Ace2 gene were further accentuated by diabetes [40\u2022\u2022] . In this more recent study, Ace2 knockout mice were crossed with Akita mice, a model of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Diabetic Ace2 knockout mice (Ace2-/yIns2 WT/C96Y) exhibited a twofold increase in urinary albumin excretion compared with Akita mice not depleted in the Ace2 gene. Increased mesangial matrix scores and glomerular basement membrane thicknesses in Ace2-/yIns2 WT/C96Y mice were accompanied by increased fibronectin and -smooth muscle actin staining in the glomeruli. There were no differences in blood pressure or heart function to account for the exacerbation of kidney injury. Although kidney levels of ANG II were not increased in the diabetic mice, treatment with an ANG II receptor blocker reduced urinary albumin excretion rate in Ace2-/yIns2 WT/C96Y mice, suggesting that acceleration of glomerular injury in these mice is ANG II mediated [40\u2022\u2022].",

With the increase in blood pressure at 6 weeks of age, the tubular expression of ACE2 is reduced in SHR compared to Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Over the course of renal development, ACE2 expression does not significantly change in the SHR kidney, whereas ACE2 expression increases in the WKY kidney [42\u2022] .

In three studies performed on Chinese cohorts, an association was found between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in Ace2 gene and blood pressure in women with the metabolic syndrome [43] and in women with essential hypertension [44, 45] . Moreover, one of the ACE2 alleles associated with high blood pressure seemed to confer a risk for reduced antihypertensive response to ACE inhibitors as well [45] . In another study, no link was reported between Ace2 gene polymorphisms and essential hypertension in Australian individuals of white Anglo-Celtic origin [46] . Collectively, the role of the Ace2 gene in conferring the predisposition to hypertension is far from clear; whether the discrepancies in genetic linkage analyses could be related to differences in ethnic origin of the cohorts studied needs further investigation. Polymorphisms in the Ace2 gene were also sought in the general population regarding echocardiographically determined parameters of left ventricular mass, structure, or function [47] . This study provides some evidence that genetic variants in the Ace2 gene may be associated with left ventricular mass and left ventricular hypertrophy in men, but no association with blood pressure was found in either men or women. In a study exploring human renal biopsy specimens, a significant correlation was found between the mRNA levels of ACE and ACE2 in a variety of renal conditions [48] . The correlation was highly significant (P < 0.001) but relatively weak (r = 0.396). Interestingly, the ACE to ACE2 ratio was significantly higher in subjects with hypertension than in subjects without hypertension. These findings are in keeping with the idea that ACE2 might play a role in maintaining a balanced status of local renal RAS by acting to counterregulate the actions of ACE.",

In contrast, in hypertensive pregnant rats, the ACE2 activity in cortex and medulla were unchanged, whereas ANG-(1-7) levels were reduced.

Two different ACE2 knockouts have been described, and hypertension is not an overt feature of either phenotype [41,50\u2022\u2022] . In a study by Gurley et al. [50\u2022\u2022] in mice on the C57BL/6 background, ACE2 deficiency was associated with a modest increase in blood pressure, whereas the absence of ACE2 had no effect on baseline blood pressures in 129/SvEv mice. However, this does not mean that ACE2 is not important in blood pressure regulation. After acute ANG II infusion, plasma concentrations of ANG II were almost threefold higher in ACE2-deficient mice than in controls; moreover, blood pressures were substantially higher in the ACE2-deficient mice than in wild-type mice [50\u2022\u2022] . Severe hypertension in ACE2-deficient mice was associated with exaggerated accumulation of ANG II in the kidney, as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry [50\u2022\u2022] . This study provided strong evidence that complete ACE2 insufficiency can increase blood pressure under conditions of ANG II excess. Based on this study, one cannot conclude whether relative ACE2 deficiency or surplus affects blood pressure. To more directly assess the role of ACE2 on blood pressure regulation, we recently used recombinant ACE2 (rACE2) administered over a period of 3 days via osmotic minipumps, with or without ANG II infusion [51] . The increase in blood pressure produced by ANG II alone was prevented by the concomitant administration of ACE2 [51] . Moreover, plasma ANG II levels were markedly reduced by rACE2 administration, thereby demonstrating the important role of this enzyme in the degradation of ANG II [51] . This suggests that the administration of rACE2 may have a role in the treatment of ANG II-dependent hypertension, and opens the way for the development of therapies based on ACE2 modulators capable of selectively increasing ACE2 activity.",

ACE2 could act by either preventing ANG II accumulation or enhancing ANG-(1-7) formation, or both. There is also increasing evidence that alterations in ACE2 may be involved in disease states, such as experimental diabetic kidney disease and possibly hypertension. Investigating the role of ACE2 in those two prevalent diseases and whether its effects are mediated by ANG II or ANG-(1-7) and other biologically active peptides, which are also substrates of ACE2, opens the way for developing new therapeutic targets in hypertension.",

Ace2 knockouts with diabetes had increased urinary albumin excretion and exaggerated glomerular pathology as compared with diabetic mice not depleted in Ace2 gene. These alterations could be reversed by administration of ANG II receptor blockade. This was the first demonstration that genetic Ace2 deficiency in diabetes is associated with ANG IIx-mediated acceleration of glomerular injury",
