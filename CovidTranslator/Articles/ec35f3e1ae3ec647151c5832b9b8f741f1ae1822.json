Winter meteorological conditions 123 Wuhan in mainland China is a metropolis (about 11 millions population), polluted by the intense 124 industrial activity. Climate in Wuhan is temperate, with relatively cold winters. Commonly, cold air 125 can stagnate on the ground. There may be cold periods during which the temperature remains 126 around freezing even during the day, and even snow can fall. Mean min-max temperatures of the 127 winter season are 3-11 o C for December, 1-8 o C for January, 4-11 o C for February and 7-15 o C for 128 March.

A pattern is more discernible than in figures 3.c 185 and 3.d, indicating that the use of temperature trend instead of daily temperature is more appropriate 186 for the analysis of correlations between daily confirmed cases and meteorological variables. The 187 correlation coefficient for temperature is negative and its magnitude achieved a maximum (\u03c1 = -188 0.77) at about 6 days. The correlation coefficient for relative humidity is positive and S-shaped, 189 achieving the maximum value (\u03c1 = + 0.65) at about 6-7 days. For the lag where maximum 190 correlations were detected, figures 5.c and 5.d show the plot of the number of daily confirmed cases 191 versus trend temperature and relative humidity, respectively. This result indicates that the today 192 number of daily confirmed cases is correlated with the temperature and relative humidity lagged 193 about one week. The lag of 6-7 days could correspond to the mean incubation period (Tian et al., 194 2020). The pattern displayed by temperature in Figure 5.c is interesting. The continuous line depicts 195 the least-squares sigmoid fitting, which shows a sharp transition from high to low number of daily 196 confirmed cases. Relative to the 6-days lagged trend temperature, the number of daily confirmed 197 cases shows two phases with crossover temperature of about 8.6 o C. Below this temperature, the 198 mean number of daily confirmed cases is about 1635 per day, and above such temperature value the 199 number of daily confirmed cases decreased to about 360 per day. Overall, the results described in 200 Figure 5 are in line with a recent report by Wang et al. (2020), who found that the 1 o C increase in 201 the minimum meteorological temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases .c showed the presence of a marked pattern between the daily confirmed cases and 6-days 206 lagged temperature trend. In turn, this shows that environmental temperature plays an important 207 play in the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China. The 6-7 days period in the hand, the two-phase pattern of the number of daily confirmed cases showed that a large 210 incidence of daily confirmed cases (about 1650 per day) occurred for low environment temperatures 211 (lower than about 8 o C). Sajadi et al. (2020) reported that 2019-nCoV spread is persistent in cities 212 and regions along a 30-50 o N' corridor showing consistent meteorological conditions with average 213 temperatures of 5-11 o C, combined with low specific (3-6 g/kg) and absolute humidity (4-7 g/m 3 ). 214 Also, Wang et al. (2020) reported that 1 o C increase in temperature and 1% increase in relative 215 humidity lower the effective reproduction number by 0.0383 and 0.0224, respectively. 216 A sharp decrease of the number of daily confirmed cases (from about 1800 to about 350 cases 217 per day) was observed for higher temperatures. Oliveiros et al. (2020) found that the doubling time 218 of newly confirmed cases has positive correlation with temperature and negative with humidity. In 219 turn, this suggests a decrease in the rate of transmission of 2019-nCoV with spring and summer 220 arrivals in the North Hemisphere. The important reduction of the number of new cases is not 221 necessarily indicating that the virus stability is sensible to relatively high temperatures, but that the 222 human transmission network is affected by the environment temperature. It is likely that the sharp 223 transition in Figure 5.c is reflecting the so-called indoor crowding effect. Average low outdoor 224 temperatures result commonly in indoor crowding as people activities takes place primordially in, 225 e.g., homes, commercial malls, sport events, and cinema, where temperature is regulated to 226 temperate conditions (about 10-25 o C). Although the outdoor relative humidity is high in winter, the 227 indoor absolute humidity hardly changes after artificial calefaction mechanisms. As a consequence, 228 the indoor ambient is warm and dry, which are benign conditions for virus transmission under 229 respiratory droplet or aerosol route mechanisms (Schaffer et al., 1976; Soebiyanto et al., 2015). 230 Warm and dry indoor conditions affect positively the transport of respiratory droplets. In fact, stable 231 respiratory droplets under low absolute humidity and warm temperature has typical diameter < 5 232 \u03bcm, which remain airborne for prolonged periods (Tellier, 2009). Besides, small aerosol droplets 233 within the microns range moves randomly, increasing the distance and exposure time over which 234 transmission can occur. In this way, Figure 5.c suggest that the high transmission rate of 2019-235 nCoV in Wuhan at low temperatures (less than about 8 o C), China could be explained from an 236 increase of indoor human activity, which is realized under regulated ambient conditions 237 characterized by warm temperature and low absolute humidity, which facilitate virus transmission.",

For instance, 243 mathematical modeling has suggested that persistent and strict self-isolation is recommended for 244 cutting off transmission channels (Tang et al., 2020). Under the hypothesis of indoor crowding 245 effect, a further recommendation involves the development of improved calefaction and air 246 conditioning equipment for controlling both temperature and absolute humidity. The use of 247 traditional calefaction and air conditioning devices could be accompanied by humidity controls to 248 avoid absolute and relative humidity depletion, and in this way reduce the risk of virus 249 transmission. However, the task temperature and humidity ranges are still unclear. Bu et al. (2020) 250 studied SARS data and arrived to the conclusion that persistent warm and dry weather is conducive 251 to the survival of the 2019-nCoV and postulated that temperature ranging 13-19 \u00b0C and humidity 252 ranging 50-80% are suitable conditions for the survival and transmission of coronavirus. 253 254 7. Conclusions 255 Predicting the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV is of prime importance for a proper design of 256 public health policies intended for disease prevention and control measures as well as for 257 economical and medical resource allocation. The present study found insights that the 258 environmental temperature plays an important role in the transmission rate of the 2019-nCoV.

(c) Plot of the relative humidity versus 338 temperature, showing negative correlations ((a) Number of daily confirmed and death cases in Wuhan, China, for the period from 1 348 January to 6 March, 2020. The large peak in 12 February corresponds to improvements in the 349 detection methods. (b) Plot of contemporaneous daily deaths (D t ) versus daily confirmed (C t ) cases. 350 (c) Plot of daily deaths (D t ) with respect to 5-days lagged daily confirmed cases (C t-5 ). (c) Behavior 351 of the correlation coefficient with respect to the lag in daily confirmed cases. Plots of daily confirmed cases versus (a) temperature and (a) relative humidity. The plots 359 exhibit a scattered pattern with weak correlations. The behavior of the correlation coefficient with 360 respect to the lag for (c) temperature and (d) relative humidity exhibit a peak in magnitude for lags 361 Meteorological (a) temperature, and (b) relative humidity in Wuhan, China, for the period 367 from 1 January to March 6, 2020. The red lined depict the long-term trend obtained by 15-days 368 moving average filtering. (c) Plot of the trend relative humidity and the trend temperature. A 369 negative correlation between these trends can be observed. Behavior of the correlation coefficient with respect to the lag, for (a) trend temperature 378 and (b) trend relative humidity. (c) Plot of daily confirmed cases and 6-day lagged trend 379 temperature. (d) Plot of daily confirmed cases and 7-day lagged trend relative humidity.",
