The main infectious agents responsible for ARIs include influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. While effective vaccines against influenza, H. influenzae type b (Hib) and S. pneumoniae infections have been available for several years, no vaccine is available at present against illnesses caused by RSV, PIV-3, metapneumovirus or any of the three novel coronaviruses. In addition, the threat constituted by the multiple outbreaks of avian influenza during the last few years is urgently calling for the development of new influenza vaccines with broader spectrum of efficacy, which could provide immunity against an avian influenza virus pandemic. This article reviews the state of the art in vaccine R&D against ARIs and attempts to address these basic public health questions.",

Whereas upper respiratory infections (URIs) are very common but seldom life-threatening, lower respiratory infections (LRIs) are responsible for more severe illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis and are the leading contributors to the nearly 4 million deaths caused each year by respiratory diseases [1] . Most of these deaths occur in children in developing countries, particularly those living in Africa and Southeast Asia [2] . The populations at greatest risk for developing a fatal respiratory infection are the very young, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. The overlaps in the clinical manifestations of the different syndromes that constitute LRIs, the difficulties in establishing precise bacteriological or viral etiology, and the frequent occurrence of concurrent infection with more than one pathogen, including measles, make the estimation of syndrome-specific or pathogenspecific disease burden particularly difficult. However, the substantial reduction in LRI mortality observed in studies in several developing countries that have implemented simple case management based on early detection and provision of antibiotics to children with LRI suggests that bacterial pneumonia contributes to the majority of deaths in these populations [3] . In addition, nosocomial or hospital-acquired pneumonia is a major infectious problem: pneumonia is the second most common type of nosocomial infections, with an associated case fatality rate of 20-50%.",

In the elderly, influenzarelated pneumonia remains a leading cause of infectious disease-related deaths. Several novel agents associated with LRIs were discovered in the past 4 years including metapneumovirus [4, 5] , the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6, 7] and human pneumonia-associated coronaviruses NL63 [8, 9] and HKU1 [10] . Measles, adenovirus and rhinoviruses also are a frequent cause of respiratory diseases. In addition, members of the herpesvirus family, including herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus and human herpes virus type 6 (HHV6) also have been associated with respiratory disease [11] . It has been estimated that one in five hospitalizations that occur each year in the USA for LRI in children less than 18 years of age are due to RSV, 12% to PIV-1, -2, and -3, and 7% to influenza virus [12] .",

Unfortunately, the currently licensed 7-valent conjugate vaccine does not contain some of the serotypes that cause severe disease in developing countries. The recently published results of a Phase III clinical trial with a 9-valent vaccine in The Gambia showed 77% efficacy against vaccine type invasive disease and 16% reduction in mortality in the vaccinated group [14] , which gives hopes that introduction of pneumococcus conjugate vaccines will have a dramatic effect on child survival in developing countries.

These studies have shown annual incidence rates of laboratory-confirmed Hib meningitis between 20 and 60 cases per 100,000 children aged less than 5 years in industrialized countries. Few prospective, population-based studies have been conducted in countries classified as developing or least developed. In sub-Saharan African, the Middle East, Latin America, and the Pacific Islands including the Philippines, incidence rates of Hib meningitis are comparable to or higher than in North America and Europe. In contrast, incidence rates were found to be substantially lower in Asia and Eastern Europe.

In several studies in which serotyping was performed, type b accounted for 5-11% of pneumonia cases [13, 24, 25] . Field trials with the Hib conjugate vaccine have demonstrated a 20% reduction in pneumonia following vaccination in The Gambia [26] and a 21% reduction in hospitalized pneumonia in Chile [27] . A recent estimate from Brazil showed a 31% reduction in radiological pneumonia following Hib vaccination [28] . On the other hand, a prospective randomized controlled trial of Hib vaccine in Lombock, Indonesia, found no reduction in radiological pneumonia and only a 2% reduction in clinical pneumonia, suggesting low frequency of Hib pneumonia in that part of Asia [22] .",

Definite progress has been made in the introduction of Hib vaccination in developing countries with the establishment of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), although significant hurdles still remain. In 2004, a Hib Vaccine Task Force commissioned by GAVI concluded that, in most countries, decision not to introduce the Hib vaccine lacked careful analysis and review of the local burden of the disease and accurate cost:benefit analysis of Hib vaccine introduction. Subsequently, GAVI approved the establishment of a Hib Initiative to support those countries wishing to sustain Hib vaccine immunization as well as those countries wishing to explore whether the introduction of the vaccine was to be considered a priority in their immunization programme.",

In temperate climate zones, seasonal epidemics typically begin in the late fall and peak in mid-to late winter. In tropical zones, seasonal patterns appear to be less pronounced, with year-round isolation of virus. In industrialized countries, annual influenza epidemics infect about 5-15% of the population each season, and cause febrile illnesses that range in severity from mild to debilitating and can lead in some instances to hospitalizations and even cause deaths. The latter mostly occur as a consequence of primary fulminant influenza virus pneumonia or of secondary respiratory bacterial infections and are facilitated by underlying pulmonary or cardiopulmonary pathologies. The risk of developing serious complications is aggravated in the very young and in the elderly. Data collected in Michigan (USA) and in Japan indicate that mass vaccination of school-aged children correlates with a reduced rate of respiratory illness in all age groups, suggesting that large-scale immunization in childhood could favorably affect influenza epidemics.",

At unpredictable intervals, due to the segmented nature of the influenza virus genome, these viruses also can acquire new genes from an avian or other animal influenza virus. This process is believed to occur most readily in pigs, as these animals can be infected by avian as well as human viruses. Co-infection in pigs can result in the emergence of a virus with a completely new glycoprotein subtype, an event which is referred to as an \"antigenic shift\". If the recombined virus infects the human population and succeeds in efficiently spreading from person-to-person, a worldwide epidemic known as a pandemic can occur [19] . Three of these pandemics occurred in the last century (1918, 1957, and 1968 ). The most severe, in 1918, infected approximately 50% of the world's population, killing an impressive 20-50 million people, particularly those in the prime of their lives. This pandemic depressed population growth for the following 10 years [39] .",

Fortunately, the virus was not able to spread from person-to-person and it was possible to stop the outbreak by massive culling of poultry. Another H5N1 strain was isolated in 2003-2004 in several countries in Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand, killing altogether 31 of the 43 patients diagnosed with the virus [15, 40] These recent outbreaks have coincided with a major epizootic of avian flu in South East Asia, due to a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus strain that not only kills domestic poultry (except ducks) but also wild birds such as geese, flamingos, and other species of aquatic birds [41] . The virus is also pathogenic for ferrets, cats and tigers. Cats can be infected with H5N1 virus both by the respiratory route and by feeding on virus-infected birds. The fear is that the H5N1 virus could gain the capacity to spread into the human population through change in receptor-binding specificity by mutation or reassortment, leading to a new pandemic. So far, no human-to-human transmission has been documented with certitude, although the increasing number of reported family clusters of H5N1 in Vietnam might signal human-to-human transmission. The finding that several poultry workers carried antibodies to the H5NI virus after the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong as well as after the 2003-2004 outbreak in Japan, point to the existence of mild or asymptomatic avian flu infections in humans, but a concerted action to establish the true extent of the spread of the virus still is lacking. Meanwhile, fresh bird outbreaks of H5N1 have been reported in Indonesia and the fear is that North Korea might be infected as well [42] .",

Influenza A viruses are further divided into subtypes according to the antigenicity of their major envelope glycoproteins, HA and NA. Fifteen HA subtypes (H1-H15) and nine NA subtypes (N1-N9) have been identified so far. Only viruses of the H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes are currently circulating in the human population.",

After binding of the virion to sialic acid-containing cell receptors, the virus-receptor complex is endocytosed into an endosome whose acidification triggers a conformational rearrangement of viral HA, and the fusion peptide at the N terminus of the HA2 polypeptide is inserted into the target cell membrane. HA2 then folds into a coiled coil, bringing viral and cell membrane in close contact so that fusion can occur [44, 46] . Classical avian virus strains have a HA0 trypsin-like cleavage site, hence their tropism for the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, highly virulent avian strains such as the 2004 H5N1 strain from Vietnam and Thailand have acquired through spontaneous mutations an ubiquitous furin-like cleavage site, which allows them to multiply in many tissues including the respiratory tract.",

PIV-3 infections are second only to RSV infections as a viral cause of serious ARI in young children. Pneumonia and bronchiolitis from PIV-3 infection occur primarily in the first six months of life, as is the case for RSV infection. Croup is the signature clinical manifestation of infection with parainfluenza viruses, especially PIV-1, and is the chief cause of hospitalization from parainfluenza infections in children 2-6 years of age. However, this syndrome is relatively less frequent in developing countries. The proportions of hospitalizations associated with PIV infection vary widely in hospital-based studies [67] . Consequently, the annual estimated rates of hospitalization fall within a broad range: PIV-1 is estimated to account for 5800-28,900 annual hospitalizations in the USA, PIV-2 for 1800-15,600 hospitalizations, and PIV-3 for 8700-52,000 hospitalizations.

Undertaking clinical trials of a SARS vaccine in a setting of vanishing perception of the potential risk of re-emergence of the disease is yet another difficulty. A final uncertainty is the possibility of immune enhancement, a phenomenon which was observed when studying vaccination of cats against the feline coronavirus, FIPV: animals vaccinated with a whole inactivated virus vaccine showed accelerated disease and death after exposure to wild type virus. The humoral response to FIPV does not seem to be protective but can in fact lead to drastically accelerated disease, presumably due to antibody-dependent enhancement of target cell infection via Fc receptor-mediated attachment of virus-antibody complexes. Control of infection and FIPV clearance are thought to primarily depend on cell-mediated immune responses [85] .",
