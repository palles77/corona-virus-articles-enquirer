However, it would need to be capable of cleaving Q\u2193M, since Met is the most common first residue at protein N-termini. In this study, we replaced the 3CL pro Thr25 with the smaller Gly residue to expand the S1\u2032 site and found that the mutant protease cleaved peptides with larger amino acids such as Met at P1\u2032 with high efficiency. The results presented here demonstrate that Thr25 is essential to determine P1\u2032 substrate specificity and that the T25G mutant can be used as a novel endopeptidase for tag cleavage of recombinant fusion proteins in addition to the commonly used thrombin, Factor Xa (FXa), and tobacco etch virus protease (TEV pro ). Moreover, we have constructed two vectors, using prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts, which contained the nucleotides encoding the T25G recognition site AVLQ\u2193M between the tags and the N-terminal Met of the target proteins. In these vectors, PstI (CTGCAG) was chosen as a 5\u2032 cloning site, since its sequence overlapped the nucleotide sequence (GCGGTGCTGCAG) encoding the protease recognition site. Identical 5\u2032-PstI/3\u2032-XhoI cloning sites in these vectors were used to allow sticky-end DNA fragments of the target genes generated by PCR (9) to ligate with these vectors simultaneously in a strategy called parallel cloning (10, 11) . These vectors, in conjunction with the T25G protease, provide new tools for convenient protein production in different hosts and tag cleavage to yield recombinant proteins with authentic sequences.",

In this study, we developed a mutant 3CL pro (T25G) with an expanded S1\u2032 space that demonstrates 43.5-fold better k cat /K m compared with wild-type in cleaving substrates with a larger Met at P1\u2032 and is suitable for tag removal from recombinant fusion proteins. Two vectors for expressing fusion proteins with the T25G recognition site (Ala-Val-Leu-Gln\u2193Met) in Escherichia coli and yeast were constructed. Identical cloning sites were used in these vectors for parallel cloning. PstI was chosen as a 5\u2032 cloning site because it overlapped the nucleotide sequence encoding the protease site and avoided addition of extra amino acids at the N terminus of recombinant proteins. 3CL pro (T25G) was found to have a 3-fold improvement over TEV pro in tag cleavage at each respective preferred cleavage site. Substrate specificity and kinetic parameters of the mutant SARS 3CL pro The peptides used as substrates for the T25G protease were synthesized via solid phase, using a 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each peptide (100 \u03bcM) was incubated with 0.1 \u03bcM T25G for 1, 2, and 6 h, and the subsequent mixtures were analyzed by HPLC on a C-18 reverse-phase analytic column. Cleavage products were resolved using a 30-min, 2-90% linear gradient of acetonitrile plus 0.1% TFA. The product peak areas were integrated to calculate the reaction rates for each peptide substrate. For K m and k cat measurements, 0.1 \u03bcM T25G and 10-200 \u03bcM SAVLQ\u2193MGFRK substrate were used, and the plot of initial rates within 10% substrate consumption versus different substrate concentrations was fitted to the Michaeli-Menten equation using the KaleidaGraph computer program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA).",

            "text": "Comparison of tag cleavage using TEV protease and T25G 3CL pro Since TEV pro is one of the most commonly used endopeptidases for tag cleavage and shares a similar substrate specificity with SARS 3CL pro , we compared the efficiency of tag cleavage using T25G 3CL pro to that of TEV pro against the E. coli-expressed UPPs fusion proteins containing their preferred recognition sites. Compared with TEV pro , T25G showed a 3-fold higher cleavage rate (0.106 \u03bcM/min versus 0.035 \u03bcM/min; data not shown). However, compared with that of FXa, another commonly used endopeptidase, the cleavage rate of T25G was 1.7 times lower (0.106 \u03bcM/min versus 0.178 \u03bcM/min; data not shown). TEV pro generally accepts any amino acid at P1\u2032 except Pro (16) . However, besides Met, T25G prefers small residues that are actually very common N-terminal residues of \"native proteins\" due to the post-translational action of Met amino peptidase. This suggests a great advantage of using T25G as a novel endopeptidase for tag removal. These engineered vectors and T25G can be assembled as a kit for the maximal production of soluble and functional proteins with authentic sequences.",
