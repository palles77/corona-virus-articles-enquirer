            "text": "A novel strain of H1N1 influenza A virus (pH1N1) emerged in 2009, causing a worldwide pandemic. Several studies suggest that this virus is antigenically more closely related to human influenza viruses that circulated prior to 1957 than viruses of more recent seasonal influenza varieties. The extent to which individuals who are na\u00efve to the 2009 pH1N1 virus carry crossreactive CD8+ T cells is not known, but a certain degree of reactivity would be expected since there is substantial conservation among the internal proteins of the virus. In the present study, we examined production of multiple cytokines in response to virus from CD8+ T cells in healthy adult subjects, between 18 and 50 years of age (born post 1957), who had no evidence of exposure to the 2009 pH1N1 virus, and had blood collected prior to the emergence of the pandemic in April of 2009. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with a panel of live viruses, and assayed by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Although results were variable, most subjects exhibited cytokine positive CD8+ T cells in response to pH1N1. Cytokine producing cells were predominantly single positive (IL2, IFN\u03b3, or TNF\u03b1); triplecytokine producing cells were relatively rare. This result suggests that although many adults carry cross-reactive T cells against the emergent pandemic virus, these cells are in a functionally limited state, possibly because these subjects have not had recent exposure to either seasonal or pandemic influenza strains.",

Hancock et al (6) measured the cross-protective antibody titers in subjects and found titers of >1:80 in 34% of subjects born prior to 1950. In contrast, fewer than 5% of those born after 1980 had protective antibody titers, which was reflected in their greater susceptibility to infection. Although young subjects were more susceptible, additional factors are thought to have contributed to disease attenuation in this population.",

Humans have a natural library of highly specific protective antibodies formed in response to natural infection and vaccination. Pandemic influenza outbreaks can occur when genetic shifts in the virus lead to changes in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) on the virus surface; under these conditions, patients have no or poor cross-protective anti-influenza antibodies.

In the case of pH1N1, there is >80% amino acid conservation of internal proteins compared to seasonal influenza, but only 30-50% amino acid conservation of HA and NA (15) . A robust circulating memory CD8+ T cell response is expected to occur with prior antigen exposure. The H1N1 pandemic provides an excellent opportunity to study the role of memory CD8+ T cells in healthy adults to cross-react to a strain of influenza that is essentially novel to the individual in terms of serum neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, it is vital to assess not only cross-reactivity, but also functional capacity of circulating CD8+ T cells. Subjects who have not been infected with influenza within the last three years might be expected to harbor T cells that are more quiescent and exhibit a limited array of cytokines when initially re-activated in vitro.",

Furthermore, we hypothesized that the quality of CD8+ T cell antigen-specific cytokine response in subjects not recently infected with influenza would exhibit very few multiple-cytokine secreting (polyfunctional) cells. To test these hypotheses, we chose an experimental approach utilizing whole virus for in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) drawn from seronegative subjects, or collected prior to emergence of pH1N1. Our results show evidence of existing CD8+ T cell immunity to pH1N1 that is characterized by predominantly single and dual cytokine producing cells.",

The frequencies of cytokine positive CD8+ T cells were variable from subject to subject. However, in most cases the proportions of IFN\u03b3+ and TNF\u03b1+ CD8+ T cells were above those observed in the allantoic fluid and media controls for pH1N1 as well as the for seasonal and laboratory viruses, though frequencies were slightly lower for pH1N1 ( Figure  4a ).

In contrast to IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1-positive cell frequencies, the IL2-secreting cell frequencies were similar between pH1N1 and negative control. The nonsignificant finding is limited because of the small sample size, which raises the risk of accepting the null hypothesis.

In triple-producers, the MFI for pH1N1 was similar to negative controls, whereas sH1N1 was greater as compared to negative controls (p=0.0107). For dual IFN\u03b3/IL2 producers, both pH1N1 and sH1N1 MFI values were significantly greater than negative controls (p < 0.0017). The lowest MFI was seen in single cytokine producers for all stimulation conditions (not shown). The MFI for TNF\u03b1 or IL2 did not vary significantly based on cytokine profile.

Our results support the hypothesis that CD8+ T cells previously primed with multiple strains of seasonal influenza virus are activated when stimulated with pandemic influenza virus. Single cytokine producing cells were by far the predominant type of CD8+ T cells observed, regardless of which virus was used to stimulate the cells. For a given individual, pattern of the cytokine responses were similar among all the viruses tested, suggesting that the novel pandemic strain is not unusual in the types of immune responses it elicits. TNF\u03b1 was the most frequently observed cytokine, followed by IFN\u03b3; IL2 single positive CD8+ T cells were not detectable above the negative controls.

T cells that produced both TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 had the highest prevalence, followed by those that produced IFN\u03b3 and IL2. Although single IL2 producing cells were not significantly more frequent among cells stimulated by virus than by controls, when IL2 positive cells were coupled with IFN\u03b3 alone or with IFN\u03b3 + TNF\u03b1, a virus-specific IL2-producing population could be discerned above the background levels. Findings recently reported by Makedonas et al, who observed a negative correlation between perforin upregulation and IL2 secretion (30) , would suggest that polyfunctionality associated with IL2 might distinguish a memory from effector phenotype. Our result in the context of their and other published findings suggests that cells responding with IL2 may represent a population poised to proliferate in response to brief antigen-stimulation prior to exerting additional antiviral effector functions (31) . IL2producing CD8 T cells are also associated with better memory CD8 T cell formation (32, 33) . However, the significance of the IL2 producing populations of CD8 T cells in our studies is not known.",

Polyfunctional CD8+ T cells have been reported to be associated with disease control in the setting of chronic infections such as HIV and Hepatitis C (23, 24, 27, 28) . It has also been postulated that polyfunctional T cells represent a highly active, less exhausted phenotype that may be more effective at controlling infection (35, 36) than single-cytokineproducing cells. Less evidence for the role of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells in acute infection is reported. Our finding of increased IFN\u03b3 MFI in association with IL2-secreting cells suggests that these may be a distinct population of highly active cells capable of proliferating and secreting cytokine with acute infection, but perhaps not exerting cytolytic function. The use of mean fluorescence intensity to compare relative size of cytokine output per cell has been validated (37) and used to study T cells in autoimmunity and chronic disease, but has not been examined in influenza-specific T cells. This method may be a useful approach to comparing relative activity in in vitro CD8+ T cell assays. Evaluating cytotoxic function of IL2+ polyfunctional cells may also aid in better defining the roles of CD8+ T cell populations.",

Shahid et al showed that low granzyme B activity and low IFN\u03b3:IL10 ratio preillness were correlated with susceptibility to influenza (49) . This correlation was first demonstrated by McElhaney et al in 2006, who measured serum antibody titers and PBMC granzyme and cytokine responses in elderly subjects immunized with inactivated influenza vaccine. They found that in this population, higher IFN\u03b3:IL10 ratio correlated with protection, whereas antibody levels did not (50) . In their more recent publication, this same group showed a negative correlation between granzyme B activity and influenza infection (51) . The importance of T cells is also supported by experiments in animal models that show T cell-mediated protection from heterosubtypic influenza infection in the absence of B cell immunity (52) . With regards to the pH1N1 virus, our recent studies demonstrate substantial CD4 and CD8 T cell mediated protection from lethal infection in animals primed with laboratory or recent seasonal human influenza viruses, and no evidence of serological protection even with sera derived from sH1N1 primed donors (pH1N1 serum was fully protective) (53) . These studies highlight the importance of studying the quality, not simply the frequency, of T cell immunity in predicting a population's susceptibility to disease. If this phenomenon were consistent with virus behavior in humans, it would be a potential explanation for disease attenuation in the setting of high susceptibility. Further studies are required to demonstrate any clinical benefit associated with polyfunctional CD8+ T cells, though if demonstrated, could serve as a novel immune correlate.",

            "text": "Our study focused on analysis of cross-protective CD8+ T cell responses, our assay development revealed several important factors that enable the use of whole virus for in vitro stimulation. These include the use of allantoic fluid as a negative control when utilizing egg-grown viral stock, and use of multiple viral preparations to account for variability in CD8+ T cell responses. We felt it was important to understand the CD8+T cell response to whole virus, since these cells are presumably reacting to processed virus from within infected antigen presenting cells. Use of whole virus most closely simulates natural infection and antigen presentation. Unfortunately, this approach does introduce some questions about how similar an individual lab viral strain is to the circulating influenza strain, and whether small differences in lab strains account for differences in results. Although we found a significant increase in cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells in response to pH1N1 as compared to negative controls, there was a consistent trend toward lower frequencies when compared to seasonal or laboratory influenza-specific responses. It is possible that changes in the surface proteins of influenza change the signals received by CD8+ T cells, thereby changing either proliferation or cytokine profile. At this time, however, whether differences between influenza strains result from a lower frequency of precursor T cells specific to pH1N1, or is intrinsic to the virus strains, is not clear. The effects of egg and tissue culture passage of human influenza viruses on human lymphocyte infectivity and antigen-presentation have not been exhaustively investigated. Such an investigation could shed some light on these issues. Interestingly, in animal studies, the A/California stock used in these studies shows a high degree of virulence (53) , similar to the A/PR/8/34 laboratory strain, consistent with the view that the virus is fit for replication in cells other than the highly permissive eggs and MDCK cell line. Nevertheless, it is possible that the variability in the HA protein introduced in the pandemic strain affected this virus's ability to infect PBMC, which would explain not only the lower T cell response, but also its retained ability to cause disease in the respiratory tract.",

The majority of circulating memory T cells specific for influenza is in a quiescent state with restricted functionality. Our finding of rare polyfunctional cytokine producing cells suggests that protection from disease by these T cells may be quite limited. The finding of such few polyfunctional CD8+ T cells may partly explain the significant number of healthy young and middle-aged adults who exhibited signs of infection during the pandemic. Based on seroprevalence and exposure studies, Carrat et al estimated that asymptomatic H1N1 influenza infection may occur in around 30% of exposed individuals (54, 55) , though exposure rates are difficult to accurately determine. It is therefore possible that either infrequent exposure or recurrent asymptomatic seasonal influenza infection may lead to a more terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cell population. This has been shown in models of either chronic active or latent infection, where frequent, repeated antigen exposure is associated with a more terminally differentiated phenotype, that is less likely to proliferate on cognate antigen engagement (27, 30, 35, 36, 56) . It will be interesting to see if the frequencies of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells are increased in subjects recovered from a documented infection.",

It would seem logical that as memory cells, CD8+ T cells are responding to epitopes highly conserved among different influenza viruses. Verification that the CD8+ T cells observed are reacting to conserved sequences will require careful mapping of class I HLA restricted epitopes. It is also possible that small nucleotide changes among the viruses lead to altered recognition in different individuals based on HLA type. Resolution of these unanswered questions will be critical in targeting CD8+ T cells in vaccine design.
