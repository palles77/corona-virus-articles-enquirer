The active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro has a catalytic dyad with the sulfur of Cys145 as a nucleophile and the imidazole ring of His41 as a general base. 4 Therefore, the SARS-CoV 3CL pro can be considered an attractive target for developing effective drugs against SARS.",

Subsequent bioactivity-guided fractionation of the CHCl 3 extracts led to the isolation of four quinone-methide triterpenoid derivatives 11 that were identified as celastrol (1), pristimererin (2), tingenone (3), and iguesterin (4) on the basis of their spectroscopic analyses (Fig. 1 ). 12 T. regelii is a woody vine native to Eastern and Southern China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. 13 This plant known as 'Thunder God Vine' has been historically used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and Behcet's disease. 14 A number of triterpenes, diterpenes, and sesquiterpenes as a major compound have been isolated from the bark of T. regelii and are known to have a variety of biological activities with good cytotoxicity to numerous cancer cell lines and efficacy in several rodent models of arthritis and 0960-894X/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that the IC 50 values of the 1-5 ranged from 2.6 to 21.7 lM against SARS-CoV 3CL pro (Table 1) and that all were dose-dependent (Fig. 2) . Celasterol (1) having acid moiety at C-20 inhibited SARS-CoV In order to confirm whether quinone-methide moiety plays to inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL pro , celastrol (1) was reacted by dehydrogenation under Pd catalyst to give the dihydrocelastrol (5) in a quantitative yield, as shown in Scheme 1. According to Schwalbe's result, 17 celastrol (1) possesses electrophilic sites within the A and B rings, where nucleophilic groups of cysteine thiol group of cell division cycle protein 37 (Cdc37) reacts with the quinonemethide of 1 through a Michael addition, resulting in the formation of an adduct at C6. Thus, we believe that this moiety would be valuable for enhancing the inhibitory activity of 3CL pro . In fact, our result showed that quinone-methide moiety of 1 (IC 50 = 10.3 lM) increased the potency of SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibition by twofold when compared with the reduced analogue 5 (IC 50 = 21.7 lM) ( Table 1 ). In view of this result, the presence of a quinone-methide moiety appears to play a relatively significant role in inhibition.",

            "text": "We then further characterized the inhibitory mechanism of the isolated quinone-methide triterpenes against SARS-CoV 3CL pro activity. This began with analysis of the mode of inhibition using both Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots. As shown representatively in Figure 3 , the kinetic plots show that compound 4 has a competitive inhibition mode of action. Because the Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/V versus 1/[S] result in a family of straight lines with the same y-axis intercept, V max (44.4 \u00b1 6.2 intensity min \u00c01 ), respectively, for the SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitor 4 (Fig. 3A) . All isolated inhibitors manifested the same inhibition mode of action. The K i value of the most potent compound 4 was determined to be 0.8 lM (Table   1 ), as found from the common x-axis intercept of lines on the corresponding Dixon plot (Fig. 3B) . To better investigate the interaction of these inhibitors with the enzyme, we attempted a molecular docking simulation of the binding of 4 and 5 into SARS-CoV 3CL pro active site. The X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro in complex with a substrate-analogue inhibitor (coded 1uk4 or 2z3e) 18, 19 obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) was used for modeling analysis. Computer docking analysis 20 revealed that iguesterin (4) can fit well into the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . As shown in Figure 4A , the hydroxyl group of C3 of 4 formed a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of Cys 44 and OH of Thr 25 located in domain I (residues 8-101), 9 whereas dihydrocelastrol (5) did not form any intermolecular bonds with the enzyme besides the hydrophobic interaction ( Fig. 4B) . Iguesterin (4) binding mode has different from betulinic acid (His164 and Thr24) and savinin (Cys145, Gln166, Gln189, Gly143 and Ser144) with 1uk4. These differences of intermolecular interaction apparently are reflected by the 10-fold smaller IC 50 value of iguesterin (4) compared with that of reference compounds in inhibiting the 3CL pro . Moreover, the calculated binding energy (kcal/mol) 19 of all quinone-methide triterpenes are shown in Table  2 . These docking experiments support the observation in the enzymatic assay, which reveals the important roles of the quinone-methide moieties inhibition of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro . Although this preliminary molecular modeling study cannot be final proof for this critical argument, it constitutes a positive sign for the possibility of the mechanism. In summary, we have identified quinone-methide triterpene derivatives as novel SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. The newly identified bioactive compounds with SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitory activity in the lM range include celastrol (1), pristimerin (2), tingenone (3) and iguesterin (4) . Although all isolated quinone-methide triterpenes has previously been known compounds, this is the first time it has been shown to possess SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitory activity. We are hopeful that these preliminary data may be able to open new avenues for research targeted toward reducing the threat of SARS to the global community. Further research and drug development on quinone-methide triterpenes as promising SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors are ongoing in our laboratory and the results will be reported in due course. ",
