While part of this diversity is generated by recombination during B-cell development and mutations during affinity maturation, the germ-line IG loci are also diverse across human populations and ethnicities. Recently, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated genotypephenotype correlations between specific IG germ-line variants and the quality of Ab responses during vaccination and disease. However, the functional consequences of IG genetic variation in Ab function and immunological outcomes remain underexplored. In this opinion article, we outline interconnections between IG genomic diversity and Ab-expressed repertoires and structure. We further propose a strategy for integrating IG genotyping with functional Ab profiling data as a means to better predict and optimize humoral responses in genetically diverse human populations, with immediate implications for personalized medicine.",

            "text": "While the prevailing paradigm for investigating B-cell and Ab-mediated responses has placed emphasis on the importance of the unique molecular mechanisms cited earlier in the generation of key functional Abs, there is a growing appreciation for the fact that IG genes are highly variable at the germ-line level, exhibiting extreme allelic polymorphism and gene copy number Table 1 ). During the initial formation of the na\u00efve repertoire, single IGH [ 2 0 9 _ T D $ D I F F ] V, D and J gene segment on one of two chromosomes in a given B cell are somatically recombined[ 2 1 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] ; at each of these steps, P and N nucleotides are added at the D-J and V-D junctions [ 2 1 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] ('junctional diversity'), respectively. This process, known as V(D)J rearrangement, is the basis for 'combinatorial diversity'. The recombined V (red), D (orange), and J (maroon) segments will then be transcribed, and following splicing, will be paired with a C gene (gray). The somatic recombination process also occurs at one of two loci encoding the Ab lightchain gene segments [IGK and IGL; except it involves only V (yellow), J (maroon), and C (light gray) gene segments]. Two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains are ultimately paired [ 2 1 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] through disulfide bonds to form a functional Ab; thus, additional diversity in the expressed Ab repertoire comes from 'heavyand light-chain pairing'. Together, the V, D, and J segments depicted comprise the variable domain of the heavy chain of a functional antibody, and together with the variable domain of the light chain, encoded by V and J segments, are responsible for Ag binding. The C [ 2 1 3 _ T D $ D I F F ] domains of both heavy and light chains [ 2 1 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] provide structural and/or effector functions of the Ab. As shown here for the heavy chain, the variable domain is partitioned into four framework regions (FRs) and three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Following Ag stimulation, 'somatic [ 2 1 5 _ T D $ D I F F ] hypermutations' introduce additional variation in the variable domain of the Ab (vertical purple bars), with the aim of improving binding affinity. [ 2 1 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] Mutations that arise via SHM can occur across [ 2 1 7 _ T D $ D I F F ] all FRs and CDRs, but these are most prevalent in CDRs, as illustrated by the hypothetical frequency histogram shown between the unmutated and mutated IG heavy-chain RNA. While the general molecular mechanisms outlined here have long been realized as the primary determinants of diversity within a given expressed Ab repertoire, there is a growing appreciation for the contribution of 'allelic diversity' as well, particularly as this pertains to repertoire differences observed between unrelated individuals. Ab, antibody; variation (CNV) between individuals and across populations [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Recent studies have begun to highlight that, in addition to diversity introduced during V(D)J recombination, heavy-and lightchain pairing, and SHM, IG germ-line variation (e.g., allelic variation; Figure 1 ) plays a [ 2 3 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] vital part in determining the development of the na\u00efve repertoire, with downstream impacts on signatures observed in the memory compartment, and the capacity of an individual to mount an Ab response to specific epitopes [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

For example, recent comparisons of the two available completed assemblies for the IGHV gene region [ 2 3 5 _ T D $ D I F F ] (1 Mb in length) revealed that two human chromosomes can vary by >100 Kb of sequence, with >2,800 SNPs, and CNVs of 10 IGHV functional/ORF genes [7, 17] . In population sequencing experiments, extreme examples of heterozygosity have been noted, with evidence of some individuals carrying more than one allele at every IGHV coding gene [9] . Supporting earlier genetic mapping data [4, 5] , more recent analysis of inferred haplotypes from Ab repertoire data surveyed in nine individuals revealed that all 18 haplotypes characterized were unique [6] . Furthermore, at the population level, of the few SNPs and CNVs screened within IGH, allele and genotype frequencies have been shown to vary considerably between ethnic backgrounds [7] [8] [9] 15] , with evidence of selection [7] . Despite the [ 2 3 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] evidence for elevated germ-line diversity, genomic resources for IG loci continue to lag behind other regions of the genome [26] . Because of this, the comprehensive and accurate genotyping of IG polymorphisms remains a significant challenge [26, 30] , and as a result, the full extent of IG polymorphism and [ 2 3 7 _ T D $ D I F F ] the implications for human health are yet to be uncovered [26] . However, it is plausible that population-level diversity in the IG loci, particularly in IGH, will rival that of other complex immune gene families, such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer cell IG-like receptor (KIR) genes. These genes are also characterized by extreme haplotype diversity, due to CNV and coding region variation [31, 32] ; HLA genes, for example, have thousands of known alleles [31] . In contrast to IG genes, HLA and KIR have been studied more extensively across human populations, and have demonstrated critical roles in disease [31, 32] .",

[ 2 3 8 _ T D $ D I F F ] Advances in high-throughput sequencing technology now enable extensive characterization of the expressed Ab repertoire [33] [34] [35] , creating opportunities for beginning to investigate the heritability of the Ab response at fine-scale resolution. Applications of these methods, collectively referred to as repertoire sequencing ('IgSeq' or 'RepSeq'), have already led to a wealth of new discoveries in a range of contexts [33, 36] . These include general observations that key features of the Ab repertoire show extensive variability between healthy individuals [10, 11, 13, 14, 37] , and a limited overlap of B-cell receptor clones between individuals, even monozygotic (MZ) twins [10, 13, 14] . However, RepSeq studies have also revealed that these inter[ 2 3 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] -individual differences are not necessarily random, but likely have a strong underlying genetic component, providing initial support for the importance of germ-line IG polymorphism 40 33 in determining the na\u00efve and Ag-stimulated Ab repertoire. For example, several recent studies have revealed that V, D, and J gene usage in the na\u00efve repertoire is much more highly correlated between MZ twins than between unrelated individuals [10, 13, 14] , and that IG gene usage patterns are consistent across time points within a given individual [38] . A role for genetic factors can be seen for other repertoire features in twins as well, including the degree of SHM [13] , and the distribution of CDR-H3 length and clone convergence [10, 13, 14] . Intriguingly, although existing data suggest that features in the memory compartment are more stochastic, likely reflective of random recruitment and transient proliferation, certain genes and repertoire features exhibit predictable patterns even in memory B cells [10, 13, 14, 39] . Although the roles of IG germ-line variants have not been comprehensively studied, there is now convincing evidence that they can influence Ab repertoire variation and function in two main ways (i and ii).

In the left panel, the F allele encodes the functional critical phenylalanine residue, and in the right panel, the primary glycine residue is encoded by the G allele. Interestingly, in both cases, the frequency of individuals lacking alleles encoding the critical residues varies among populations, with the L/L and R/R genotypes showing the lowest frequencies in Africans, and the highest frequencies in South Asians. rs55891010 and rs11845244 are in linkage disequilibrium, and thus R50 and L54 amino acids (and likewise, G50 and F54) tend to co-occur in alleles of IGHV1-69. This explains similarities in genotype frequency estimates between the two SNPs in each population. *Although these genotypes may contain error due to confounds of unrepresented CNV information, they can provide insight into potential population differences.

Our own work has also demonstrated this relationship, but uncovered associations for IGHV1-69 coding and potentially noncoding polymorphism as well as CNV [15] . Inferred deletions of IGHD genes have also been shown to associate with variation in D-J pairing frequencies, demonstrating that germ-line effects on the repertoire extend beyond V genes [12] . An interesting aspect of IGH CNVs is that, in addition to observed effects of these variants on the genes within the CNV event, they also can impact the usage of genes elsewhere in the locus [12, 15] . For example, we recently observed apparent long-range effects of IGHV1-69 CNV in the na\u00efve and memory repertoire, in that individuals with fewer IGHV1-69 germ-line copies and reduced usage showed consistently higher usage of IGHV genes over 200 Kb away [15] . The mechanisms underlying the observed effects of CNVs in human IG loci remain technically difficult to assess experimentally, but it has been speculated that these large changes in locus architecture (i.e., deletions and insertions) could alter regulatory systems related to V(D)J recombination [12, 15] , for example, by modifying the chromatin landscape, cis-regulatory elements and transcription factor binding, and/or the physical locations of the IG V, D, and J genes. All of these factors are known to be key determinants of IG gene accessibility and usage frequencies in mice [43, 44] .",

RSSs, which are critical for the recruitment of RAG1/2 [ 2 4 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] proteins, have also been demonstrated to impact IGHV gene usage in mice [43, 44] . Moreover, extensive work in the murine IG gene loci has uncovered important roles for other key cis-regulatory sequences and transcription factors as well [45, 46] . Such analyses have not yet been comprehensively conducted in humans, and as a result, our knowledge of the IG regulatory elements involved in the formation of the expressed Ab repertoire is restricted to canonical RSS, promoter, enhancer elements, and class switch regions. However, even for these well-known noncoding regulatory regions, limited data on human population-level variation exist, and thus the broader consequences of polymorphism in these elements on Ab repertoire variability have not been explored.",

Most demonstrable is the fact that many of the genes with the most variability in na\u00efve repertoire usage across individuals are also known to be in CNV, including examples of the complete absence of genes in the expressed Ab repertoires of some donors [6, [10] [11] [12] . In addition, allele-specific usage in the na\u00efve Ab repertoires of individuals heterozygous at a given IGHV gene has been demonstrated, also clearly suggesting a role for noncoding variation and CNV [11] . Moreover, although effects of germ-line IG polymorphism may be most evident on a per gene basis, it is worth This is an important point given that CDR-H3 variation has classically been considered independent of the germ line [13, 14] .",

For example, across the 267 coding alleles cataloged in IMGT for functional and ORF IGHV genes, 60% of the 382 [ 2 4 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] polymorphisms are nonsynonymous (Table 1) , including sites located in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 with predicted relevance to Ab functional residue diversity (see Figure IB in Box 1). Although the CDR-H3 loop, formed at the V (D)J junction, is the most diverse region of an Ab and is a principal determinant of specificity [47, 48] , there is a growing appreciation for the importance of residues outside of CDR-H3 in antigen recognition and binding [15, [49] [50] [51] . For example, recent analyses have shown that the median length of CDR-H2, which is solely encoded by germ-line V gene sequence, is substantially longer than that of CDR-H3, and typically forms the same number of interactions with antigen [52] . Specifically, analyses of antigen-binding [ 2 4 5 _ T D $ D I F F ] region (ABRs; which roughly correspond to CDRs, but differ slightly in their boundaries) have shown that Abs contain a median of six, six, and four contact residues in the heavy-chain CDR-H3, H2, and H1 ABR regions, respectively. In addition, the overall percentage of energetically important [ 2 4 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] Ag-binding residues within each ABR follows the same rank order, with 31%, 23%, and 14% for H3, H2, and H1, respectively. Similar trends were noted for light-chain ABRs as well [52] . In addition, considering that many known nonsynonymous sites reside outside of CDRs (Table 1) , it is worth highlighting the fact that there are also examples demonstrating indirect effects of framework region variants on Ag binding [53, 54] .",

The initial observation from RepSeq studies that essentially no Ab clones were shared among individuals, including MZ twins, posed a challenge to comparative Ab repertoire analysis: how could correlates of protection be identified in the Ab repertoire if every individual was responding with different Abs? However, an answer began to emerge with the observation that in multiple settings, including viral and bacterial infection, different individuals have been shown to respond to a given antigen with Abs that share convergent amino acid signatures [13, 49, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . These convergent Abs are often encoded by common V genes or sets of V genes, and specific amino acid residues in their CDRs enable them to converge upon a common binding solution against a shared antigen. Critically, in some cases evaluated, convergent signatures include amino acid residues that are directly encoded in the germ line. The occurrence of such convergent Ab responses highlights the potential for tracking common immune responses across individuals, and understanding the role of genetic factors, even when each individual creates unique Abs. Importantly, the implications of this line of thinking could be broad, as IG gene biases have been observed in contexts other than infection, including autoimmunity and cancer [59, 60] . Moreover, IG gene biases may also extend to usage patterns of D and J genes, light-chain genes, and heavyand light-chain V gene pairing frequencies [56, 61, 62] .",

These examples illuminate a direct role of the IG germ line in disease-associated Ab responses. In the case of stem-directed broadly neutralizing Abs (BnAbs) against influenza hemagglutinin (HA), the most prevalent Abs use the heavy-chain gene IGHV1-69 [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . These IGHV1-69 BnAbs recognize an overlapping epitope of group 1 influenza A viruses and only amino acids from IGHV make contact with HA. Importantly, of the 14 known alleles at IGHV1-69, only those encoding a critical phenylalanine at position 54 (F54) within CDR-H2 have a major role in shaping the BnAbs response [16, 15, 55, 71] . Although IGHV1-69 F54-encoding alleles are dominant, there is a growing list of additional HA-directed BnAbs that also show IG germ-line biases [51, 56, [72] [73] [74] , including those also known to be polymorphic with respect to coding variants and CNVs.",

In addition to usage frequencies, IGHV1-69 genotype also associated with IGHV1-69 [16, 55] .

However, we and others have shown that individuals lacking IGHV1-69 F54 alleles likely utilize other germ-line genes in place of IGHV1-69 [51, 55] . This finding in particular both highlights the complexity of the Ab response and demonstrates that the integration of genotyping information can help provide a more nuanced interpretation of the signatures discovered in the expressed repertoire.

            "text": "Together, this knowledge should pave the way to using molecular and genetic signatures for mapping an individual's exposure history, current wellness state, and immune potential against future antigenic threats. For example, characterization of genotypes that specifically lead to common BnAb signatures in the repertoire should be useful for tailoring vaccines to responsive genotypes with the goal of achieving 100% 'universal vaccine' responsiveness at the population level ( Figure 2 ). In addition, such information could lead to advances in the use of anti-idiotypic antibody and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies that are directed against germ-line gene expressing B-cell clonotypes that are directly involved in autoimmune disease and hematologic malignancies [78, 79] . We face tall hurdles to moving this paradigm forward, the greatest being the completion of a comprehensive [ 2 6 0 _ T D $ D I F F ] catalogue of human IG haplotype variation [26] . However, with ever expanding advances in immunologic and genomic technologies, we believe that such integrative approaches are within our reach, and have the potential to transform our understanding of Ab-mediated immune responses in the clinical and research arenas. Do effects of IG genetic variants on the Ab repertoire correspond to known biases in disease and/or clinically relevant Ab responses?",

(B) Violin plot showing nonsynonymous polymorphism rates in CDR positions with high (>0.6; 'high', blue) or low (<0.25; 'low', red) frequency of contact with antigen, as labeled on the X axis. The Y axis records, for each CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 position, the number of IMGT IGHV genes that have alleles with nonsynonymous polymorphisms at that position. The positional probability of antigen contact was calculated for each CDR position as the percentage of 150 crystal structures of antibody-antigen complexes from the protein database (PDB) where any atom of that residue is within 5 \u00c5 of any antigen atom. Allelic variation is enriched in antigencontact sites, in that the number of IGHV genes with alleles containing nonsynonymous polymorphisms is greater for high contact probability positions.
