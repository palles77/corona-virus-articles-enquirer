Freshwater microbes annually are responsible for four billion cases of diarrhea (2.2 million deaths), according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Poor hygiene that is associated with use of unclean water has resulted in an estimated 200 million schistosomiasis infections, with six million cases of blindness worldwide. 1 Freshwater sources, historically, have been associated with epidemics: during the 1800s in the United States there were eight major cholera outbreaks (caused by Vibrio cholerae) and three typhoid outbreaks (caused by Salmonella typhosa).",

However, even chlorinated drinking water is not sterile, and many people work in occupations with considerable exposure to water containing wastes. In addition, molecular diagnostic methods and DNA-based biodiversity studies are revealing that old pathogens are causing new problems, and novel microbes are being discovered in every setting. Epidemiologic reports have led to the recognition of emerging waterborne pathogens. As part of its regulatory role, the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Drinking Water prepares a list of 25 priority pollutants for scrutiny and research. In March of 1998, the agency published its Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List in the Federal Register. 2 It was notable that ten of the 25 pollutants of concern were micro-organisms: Acanthamoeba, Adenoviruses, Aeromonas hydrophila, Caliciviruses (Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses), Coxsackieviruses, Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), Echoviruses, Helicobacter pylori, Microsporidia (e.g., Cyclospora cayetanensis), Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare.",

Waterborne pathogens can also become foodborne when food is grown or prepared using water containing pathogenic microbes.

These microbes cause a wide variety of diseases, including acute gastrointestinal, upper and lower respiratory, meningitis, myocarditis, dermatitis, cirrhosis, bacteremia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (see also Chapter 22) . Because diseases vary greatly in severity, the US characterizes pathogens as Notifiable, Select, or Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) agents. Notifiable agents require notification of state public health physicians; the specific agents reported may vary from state to state. Waterborne Notifiable disease agents include Cryptosporidium parvum, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Giardia intestinalis, Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio cholerae, Poliovirus, and agents such as Shigella sonnei, which causes dysentery. 5 have been linked to newly identified pathogens such as Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli O157, Giardia, hepatitis A, Legionella, Naegleria, Acanthamoeba, Norwalk virus, Pleisiomonas shigelloides, Pseudomonas, and Schistosoma spindale. Improvements in sanitary infrastructure, including waste water treatment and drinking water protection, have drastically reduced the burden of waterborne disease, as well as the number of outbreaks. However, massive waterborne disease outbreaks continue to occur. The largest recent waterborne outbreak involved more than 400,000 cases of cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1993. 7 Another waterborne outbreak in Washington County, New York, in 1999 8 resulted in 148 cases of E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni infections. Outbreaks of waterborne illness have been associated with drinking water as well as recreational exposure to swimming pools, and natural water (bodies containing fresh and salt water).",

On the other hand, a limited number of waterborne pathogens (e.g., Legionella spp., Vibrio spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are indigenous to the water environment. Control of these agents and their potential infections is dependent on controlling exposure to water containing these organisms or by treating the water to remove or inactivate the infectious agents.",

The flagellated protozoan parasite Giardia was the leading causative agent for 15 of the remaining 40 outbreaks. Giardia was the leading cause of waterborne outbreak in the preceding ten-year period as well. Another eukaryotic parasite, Cryptosporidium parvum, was the next leading cause (Table 54. 2), accounting for ten of the 40 outbreaks. However, C. parvum accounted for the largest number of cases due to waterborne pathogens, mainly due to the Milwaukee outbreak that involved more than 400,000 cases. Shigella sonnei and E. coli O157:H7 each was responsible for four outbreaks. Two outbreaks were attributed to Shigella flexneri and the remaining five outbreaks were attributed one each to: Salmonella typhimurium, Pleisiomonas shigelloides, non-O1 Vibrio cholerae, hepatitis A, and a 'small round structured virus'. The low number of waterborne outbreaks of infectious disease is a tribute to the success of water treatment processes, especially the final disinfection and maintenance of residual disinfectant in the distribution systems. It is to be mentioned that while bacterial and viral pathogens are controlled effectively by the current disinfection processes, a successful control regimen for pathogens such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium involves the use of alternative disinfection technologies, such as ozonation and ultraviolet treatment, prolonged contact time with chlorine, and efforts to protect the source waters from resistant pathogens.",

In the period 1990-1998, 14 ,962 cases of disease associated with recreational water exposure were reported to the CDC. [9] [10] [11] [12] Pseudomonas spp. were consistently reported every year during this period as a causative agent in 607 cases. However, the largest number of cases, 10,269, were (Table 54. 3). Microbial hazards associated with marine and estuarine environments are discussed in the next section. The risk associated with recreational exposure to pathogens has been assessed in epidemiologic studies by comparing disease or symptom incidence rates for swimmers versus non-swimmers, or swimmers exposed to recreational waters with varying levels of microbial pollution. Pruss 14 reviewed 22 published epidemiology studies and concluded that there was agreement in a strong association of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and exposure to waters containing enterococci, fecal streptococci, thermotolerant coliforms, and E. coli. Pruss' conclusion, based on evaluating epidemiologic designs, was that enterococci and fecal streptococci were the most reliable indicator organisms for GI symptoms associated with exposure to marine and fresh waters; and that E. coli was a reliable indicator organism in fresh water and nearly as reliable as enterococci in marine waters. The observed illness threshold values described in the studies evaluated by Pruss were low for the enterococci and fecal streptococci and higher for the thermotolerant coliforms. 14-16 As a practical matter, the methodologies for recovery of these indicator organisms are not precise when applied to environmental water samples. Consequently, the higher threshold values for the E. coli and thermotolerant coliforms [17] [18] [19] are a more pragmatic yardstick for predicting the causal relationship between swimming and illness.",

The shallow depth and relatively low water volume in these pools leads to faster disinfectant depletion rates (due to the effects of ultraviolet light) and a higher concentration of organic matter following accidental bowel movements. 20 A variety of eukaryotic, viral and bacterial pathogens are transmitted through swimming pools. Cryptosporidium, one of the most important waterborne pathogens of the past decade, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] is a frequent cause of recreational water-borne outbreaks 21 (Table 54. 2).

A K. brevis toxin, brevetoxin, is responsible for NSP symptoms, which include altered sensations in the mouth and extremities, dizziness, loss of co-ordination, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Brevitoxin may also be aerosolized when it is released from cells by lysis or excretion and incorporated into marine aerosol by wind and breaking surf along the coast. 23 Air samples taken during red tide conditions along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of Florida, as well as the Atlantic coast of North Carolina, were measured at 160-180 ng/mm 2 . 23 The CDC is currently conducting a study to assess the health effects of exposure to aerosolized red tide agent. 5 Another disease in which recreational or occupational exposure is thought to be potentially involved is PEAS, which is associated with two species of marine dinoflagellate, Pfiesteria piscicida and P. shumwayae. Pfiesteria has been implicated in massive fish kills occurring in estuaries along the southeastern Atlantic coast of the USA. Fish and shellfish located at the site of Pfiesteria blooms are lethargic, disoriented, and contain ulcers. 24 Although water-soluble Pfiesteria toxins are hypothesized to exist, none have been isolated and characterized in the laboratory, or detected in the environment, and a recent report challenged the notion that P. shumwayae even has the capacity to produce dinoflagellate-like toxin. 25 Studies documenting the effects of Pfiesteria species on humans originated with observations of respiratory, gastrointestinal, optical, and neurologic symptoms following exposure to aerosol in a laboratory. 26 Subsequent retrospective epidemiologic investigations have compared the health status of symptomatic individuals in contact with Pfiesteria blooms to controls. 27, 28 Mild flu-like illness as well as learning and memory difficulties were reported to be associated with exposure, but exposure assessments other than self-report were not possible. A large prospective study was unable to identify health issues in a cohort of individuals with recreational or occupational exposure, 29 and a cross-sectional study comparing the health of watermen working either in estuaries (site of Pfiesteria-associated fish kills) or the ocean failed to find significant differences upon medical, neurologic, neuropsychologic, or neurobehavioral evaluation system 2 (NES-2) evaluation, but did note a significantly reduced visual contrast sensitivity among the estuarian watermen. 30 Further studies, especially those that specifically measure exposure to Pfiesteria or its toxins, are needed to establish PEAS as a human disease. 31",

Severe infections result in liver and kidney dysfunction and a high mortality rate. 59 Rodents, particularly rats, are common hosts of infection, but a variety of wild and domestic mammals can be infected. The organisms can survive for months in water, and isolation from waste water is not uncommon, particularly in tropical and semi-tropical climates. 60 Fewer than 100 cases of leptospirosis are reported each year in the United States. 8 Other bacteria causing gastrointestinal ailments include Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Arcobacter. 61 The most commonly detected viruses in waste water belong to the Enterovirus group of the Picornaviruses, which consists of small single-stranded RNA viruses and includes Poliovirus, Echovirus, and Coxsackievirus. Other viruses associated with waste water and fecal contamination include Adenovirus, Aichi virus, Astrovirus, hepatitis A and E, Calicivirus, and Reovirus. Rotavirus (a member of the Reoviridae) is the most infectious of all the enteric viruses and should be considered a high risk in waste water. 62 Protozoan parasites such as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, and Cryptosporidium parvum are recovered from waste water more frequently than from other environmental sources. These parasites are also recovered from natural fresh and estuarine waters in the USA and worldwide. [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] Toxoplasma gondii and Cyclospora are also frequently recovered from waste water. Entamoeba histolytica causes amebiasis (amebic dysentery), and more serious extraintestinal disease affecting the liver. Giardia intestinalis (lamblia) and Cryptosporidium parvum have been implicated in waterborne cases of diarrhea, with flatulence and greasy stools, primarily from drinking surface water and inadequate treatment systems. Nonhuman animals serve as secondary or carrier hosts. The recurring contamination of water and cycling of these organisms to humans creates an almost endless source of infection. Helminth parasites (worms) found in waste waters include Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm), Necator americanus (hookworm), Trichuris trichiuria (whipworm), Toxocara canis (canine roundworms), and Strongyloides stercoralis (the agent of strongyloidiasis). These worms all have life cycles that are dependent on a host during part of the reproductive cycle, and produce infective cysts, the form likely to be encountered in waste water. Helminthic eggs/cysts that make it past the waste water treatment process may survive in soils and sludges for up to ten years. 68",

The risk posed by transmission of waterborne disease from the agriculture watershed to the population is substantial. 70 Virulent bacteria and parasites can remain viable in the watershed environment, become amplified by agricultural practices, or contaminate the food supply with toxin (as in the case of algal blooms) or pathogens.

The principal fecal sources are livestock and poultry, followed by wildlife and companion animals. 70 Manure from cattle, horses, pigs, and poultry is routinely processed and used as farm and commercial fertilizer. An additional source of agricultural exposure to infectious agents is the use of biosolids (sludge) from municipal waste water treatment plants, 73 where pathogens surviving sewage treatment are a potential health threat. Protozoan cysts can survive in water as long as 180 days; helminth (worm) ova can survive in soil seven years; bacteria and viruses may live up to a year. 74, 75 Additionally, fecally contaminated water from animal feeding operations may leach into surface or ground water. On-farm recycling can also release pathogens into the environment. Manure contains numerous eukaryotes (protozoa), as well as anaerobic, aerobic, and facultatively aerobic bacteria that contribute to the decomposition of manure. 76 For this reason, manure is stored and decomposed as an aerated liquid slurry concentrate. Sludge and lagoon water are removed periodically and applied to farmland. Unprocessed sewage may be carried from lagoons and storage ponds into overland flow or subsurface water. Obviously, the occupational hazards of waste water workers would also be applicable in these situations. Waterborne hazards in the agricultural watershed include protozoa, bacteria, viruses, and helminths. Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia spp. are the protozoal pathogens of primary concern. Of lesser concern are Entamoeba histolytica, Toxoplasma gondii, and Balantidium coli. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 70 Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria make up the bulk of the feces. In a study of bacteria obtained from chicken intestines, 70% of the contents of the ileum were related to the Lactobacillus genus, and the rest were related to Clostridia, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus. 77 In the cecum, clostridial relatives comprised 65%, and the remainder were related to Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides. Facultatively aerobic organisms belonging to genera Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter, among others (fecal coliforms), are used as measures of fecal contamination in the environment because they are easily cultured and nearly always present in fecal matter.",

Second, the genetic material of waterborne viruses, unlike bacteria or protozoa, may consist of single-or double-stranded forms of DNA or RNA. Molecular methods used to detect the presence of viruses in water samples commonly rely on PCR, which utilizes a thermostable DNA polymerase. Because this enzyme amplifies DNA, but not RNA molecules, viruses with RNA genomes must first be converted to a DNA copy.
