Following intracranial (i.c.) inoculation with either serotype 3 (T3) or serotype 1 (T1) reovirus, increased expression of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and myxovirus-resistance protein (Mx1; a prototypical IFN stimulated gene) was observed in mouse brain tissue. Type I IFN receptor deficient mice (IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 ) had accelerated lethality, compared to wildtype (B6wt) controls, following i.c. T1 or T3 challenge. Although viral titers in the brain and eyes of reovirus infected IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly increased, these mice did not develop neurologic signs or brain injury. In contrast, increased reovirus titers in peripheral tissues (liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and blood) of IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice were associated with severe intestinal and liver injury. These results suggest that reovirus-infected IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice succumb to peripheral disease rather than encephalitis per se. To investigate the potential role of type I IFN in brain tissue, brain slice cultures (BSCs) were prepared from IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice and B6wt controls for ex vivo T3 reovirus",

The type I interferon (IFN) genes, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, are induced in response to viral infection via activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) transcription factors (Randall and Goodbourn 2008) . These cytokines are then secreted from cells to act in an autocrine and paracrine manner through a common heterodimeric type I interferon receptor (IFNAR). Agonist-receptor binding results in activation of transcription factors STAT1 and STAT2 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) which, along with IRF9, form a heterotrimeric transcription factor complex known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to IFN-stimulated response elements to induce transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The cellular \"antiviral state\" is established through the combined functionality of ISG gene products. Several ISGs have direct antiviral functions while others modulate the immune system by activating effector cells and promoting the development of an acquired immune response.",

Reoviruses have the capacity to induce apoptosis in both cultured cells in vitro (Clarke and Tyler 2003) and target organs in vivo (Clarke and Tyler 2009) . Reoviral infection has served as a versatile model system for the study of viral pathogenesis and antiviral immunity in the brain (encephalitis; Clarke et al. 2005) , spinal cord (myelitis; Goody et al. 2008) , and heart (myocarditis; Sherry 2002) . The potential with which a given reovirus strain induces myocarditis is negatively correlated to its induction of, and sensitivity to, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Sherry et al. 1998) . Furthermore, the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response is critical for myocardiocyte protection against reovirus replication both in vitro and in vivo (Sherry 2009 ). The importance of the IFN response in limiting reovirus replication and pathogenesis is also evidenced by in vivo models of peroral inoculation with reovirus serotype 1 strain Lang (T1L). For instance, systemic T1L infection and animal lethality is inhibited via IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 release from intestinal dendritic cells residing in Peyer's patches (Johansson et al. 2007) . Similarly, IRF3 plays a role in restricting systemic T1L replication, limiting pathological changes in the heart, and preventing associated mortality (Holm et al. 2010) .",

Reovirus infection of the brain (Tyler et al. 2010 ) and spinal cord (S.A.S., personal communication) is associated with increased expression of ISGs. The profile of ISGs induced in the brain during reovirus encephalitis is remarkably similar to that seen following infection of the brain with other neurotropic viruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) (Sharma et al. 2008) and dengue virus type 1 (Bordignon et al. 2008) , suggesting a consistent host response to viral infections of the brain. We have previously demonstrated that, in brains infected with reovirus serotype 3 strain Abney (T3A), (STAT1) is phosphorylated at sites critical for its transcriptional activity (Goody et al. 2007) . Mice lacking STAT1 demonstrate increased susceptibility to reovirus infection, increased mortality, and higher viral titers in the brain compared to wildtype controls. However, the role of IFN in virus-induced brain injury and disease was not described in these studies and the cause of death was not established. In the present study, we sought to directly assess the role of IFN in the virally infected host in terms of CNS-specific andsystemic viral replication/pathogenesis by utilizing ex vivo and in vivo models of reovirus infection.",

Mice lacking functional IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 ) have accelerated mortality and markedly increased viral titers in both brain and peripheral organs following reovirus infection. IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with T3 reovirus show an extended pattern of viral tropism in the CNS compared to congenic wildtype (B6wt) mice, as evidenced by the previously unreported capacity of the virus to infect neurons of the dentate gyrus and both ependymal and meningeal cells. We utilized a novel ex vivo brain slice culture system to reveal that IFN is produced locally in the CNS and does not depend upon extraneuronal aspects of viral infection (e.g., infiltrating inflammatory cells). This brain-derived IFN limits viral replication and reduces viral-induced apoptotic injury within the CNS. Overall, these data indicate that reovirus infection (both in vivo and ex vivo) induces a robust IFN response, which serves to restrict viral tropism, limit viral growth, and reduce consequent apoptosis within the CNS.",

Infection with either reovirus serotype induced significant upregulation of IFN-\u03b1 ( Fig. 1a) and transcripts in comparison to mock animals at 8 days postinfection (dpi). Compared to T1L-infected brains at 8 dpi, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction was significantly greater (p\u22640.027) in T3A-infected brains. Mx1 is a prototypical ISG, thus its expression serves as an indicator of functional IFN signaling. Mx1 mRNA was significantly elevated (p\u22640.044) in T3A-infected brains, in comparison to either T1L or mock samples at multiple time points (Fig. 1c ). Compared to mock-infected brains, T1L-infected brains had significantly greater (p\u22640.036) expression of Mx1 only at 8 dpi. We previously demonstrated IFN and ISG induction by oligonucleotide arrays performed on RNA extracted from the brains of mice infected i.c. with reovirus serotype 3 strain Dearing (T3D; Tyler et al. 2010) . Specifically, T3D infection induced expression of 8.7-fold greater IFN-\u03b2, 9.9-fold greater IFN-\u03b1, and 84.2-fold greater Mx1 in comparison to mock controls at 8 dpi. The magnitude of these effects is comparable to those seen following infection with T3A ( Fig.  1a-c) .

All CNS (brains and eyes) and peripheral (liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, and blood) tissues contained significantly higher (p\u2264 0.047) viral titers in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice, as compared to B6wt mice, following infection with T1L (Fig. 3a) , T3A (Fig. 3b) , and T3D (Fig. 3c ). T3D is a neurotropic reovirus strain that is not extensively spread through the hematogenous route.

Overall, this data indicates that viral replication and spread is controlled by the host IFN response.",

At its most severe, this liver injury is characterized by hyperemia and hepatocyte enlargement (Fig. 4a , bottom panel). Intestinal injury in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice is characterized by mucosal perforation accompanied by hemorrhage into the intestinal lumen (Fig. 4b , bottom panel). Not surprisingly in the setting of intestinal injury, bacterial (i.e., Enterococcus and Staphylococcus) species were cultured from the spleens of several IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown). In contrast to findings in liver and intestine, histological analysis revealed that the brains of T3-infected IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice appeared normal immediately prior to death ( Fig. 4c ) and had no evidence of apoptosis activation (data not shown). Infected IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice did not develop neurologic symptoms prior to death despite the fact that these experiments entailed direct brain inoculation of T3 reovirus, a highly neuropathogenic virus. B6wt mice show significant injury at late times post-infection, but only minimal pathology at 4dpi. In aggregate, these data suggest that IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice do not succumb to encephalitis, but instead develop terminal liver and intestinal injury, accompanied by secondary bacterial infection and sepsis.",

A brain slice culture (BSC) model of viral encephalitis was recently characterized for the study of brain tissue-specific immune responses in isolation from the whole animal (Dionne et al. 2011 ). Utilization of this system allowed us to study the potential role of IFN in the brain's innate immunity against reovirus, independent from events occurring outside of the CNS. To confirm that T3A-induced IFN-\u03b2 expression occurred ex vivo, BSCs were prepared from Swiss Webster mice and immediately infected with T3 reovirus. Media was changed ~12 h later and every 2 days thereafter. Media, from experimentally similar wells, was pooled at 5 or 9 dpi for three independent experiments and serially diluted for enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based quantification of IFN-\u03b2 release by mock-or T3A-infected BSCs. In T3A-infected samples, IFN-\u03b2 protein was detected in 7-9 dpi media (19.98\u00b120.34 pg/mL), but not 3-5 dpi media. IFN-\u03b2 was not detected in the media from mock samples suggesting that BSCs release little to no IFN-\u03b2 at baseline. This study confirmed that cells, resident to the CNS, produce IFN-\u03b2 at the protein level in response to T3A reovirus.",

IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 and B6wt brains were harvested 4 days following infection with T3D (1,000 pfu) and the pattern of viral infection was examined by immunofluorescent staining of \u03c33 viral antigen. We have previously shown that, in wildtype mice, T3 reoviruses specifically infect neurons of the lateral thalamus, cingulate cortex, and CA3 region of the hippocampus (Oberhaus et al. 1997; Richardson-Burns et al. 2002) . Consistent with these results, effective T3D infection of the CA3 is seen in B6wt animals by 11 dpi, but not as early as 4 dpi (Fig.  6a ). In contrast, viral antigen is found in the CA3 of IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice by 4 dpi. At this time point, there is also evidence of reovirus antigen throughout the IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. Dentate infection does not occur in T3D-infected B6wt mice even at late times post-infection when viral titer approaches 10 9 pfu/mL; thus, the presence of reovirus antigen in the dentate gyrus in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice is indicative of extended T3D tropism. Dual fluorescence imaging of reovirus antigen and NeuN neuronal marker confirmed that enhancement of viral replication in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice occurred specifically in neurons of the CA3 and dentate brain regions (Fig. 6b) . These data indicate that IFN serves to limit T3 reovirus neurotropism in the brain. T1L does not normally infect neurons in wildtype mouse brains and neuronal tropism was not observed in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice following inoculation of T1L (data not shown).",

Our results are also consistent with other reports highlighting the importance of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling in the control of viral replication in the CNS (Randall and Goodbourn 2008) . For example, increases in brain viral load have been reported following infection of IFNAR-deficient mice with Sindbis virus (Ryman et al. 2000) , SFV (Fragkoudis et al. 2007 ), VEEV (Grieder and Vogel 1999) , MHV (Ireland et al. 2008) , and WNV (Samuel and Diamond 2005) . Deficiencies in the expression of other proteins involved in IFN signaling including STAT1, IRF3, and IRF7 have similar effects on viral replication in the brain (Daffis et al. 2008; Goody et al. 2007; Holm et al. 2010; Menachery et al. 2010 ).",

We showed that reovirus growth was significantly increased in slices derived from IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to slices derived from B6wt controls although the magnitude of this increase was not as dramatic as that seen in vivo. This discrepancy is likely due to viral reseeding that occurs in the intact animal, but not the ex vivo culture system. In addition, we saw an increase in Caspase 3 activity in reovirusinfected IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 brain slices compared to infected B6wt controls. We have previously demonstrated that apoptosis is a primary mechanism of neuronal cell death and tissue injury during reovirus encephalitis (Oberhaus et al. 1997; Richardson-Burns et al. 2002) . Our results thus suggest that local IFN response within the brain is protective and serves to limit both viral growth and virus-induced tissue injury.",

Particularly striking is the extended tropism of T3 reovirus strains to ependymal cells (Fig. 6) . Early data suggested that T1L, but not T3 reovirus strains, induce hydrocephalus because T1 strains encode a unique viral hemagglutinin, which mediates high-affinity ependymal cell binding (Tardieu and Weiner 1982; Weiner et al. 1977) . Our results demonstrate that in the absence of IFN, T3 reovirus strains can also infect and efficiently replicate within ependymal cells. In contrast, wildtype mice do not support reovirus infection within these cell types even at late time points post-infection when whole brain viral titers are in excess of 10 8 pfu/mL. Given these results, we conclude that T3 reovirus strains have the capacity to infect ependymal and meningeal cells; however, in the presence of the host IFN response viral replication is effectively inhibited in these cell types. Increased tropism to ependymal cells, in the absence of IFN signaling, has also been seen following infection of the brain with WNV (Samuel and Diamond 2005) , Sindbis virus (Ryman et al. 2000) , measles virus (Mrkic et al. 1998) , TMEV (Fiette et al. 1995) , and Semiliki forest virus (Fragkoudis et al. 2007) . Taken together, our results and prior studies suggest that type I IFN plays a key role in protecting ependymal cells from infection by neurotropic viruses.",

All statistical analyses were performed using Instat and Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical comparisons between two groups (i.e., mock vs. infected or B6wt vs. IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 ) were made using a two-tailed, unpaired t test with Welch correction. For survival studies, the mean day of death \u00b1 standard deviation was calculated for each group of mice. Differences in survival were calculated using a logrank (Mantel-Cox) test. Probability values of p<0.05 were considered significant differences and denoted as such with asterisks. IFN signaling occurs in reovirus-infected brain tissue. Total RNA was purified from the brains of mock-, T1L-, or T3A-injected Swiss Webster mice at indicated time points (N=3-4) and reverse transcribed to cDNA. qPCR revealed a significant upregulation (p\u22640.028) of IFN-\u03b1 (a) and IFN-\u03b2 (b) mRNA induced by both T3A and T1L, in comparison to mock infection at 8 dpi. qPCR also revealed a significant upregulation of Mx1 mRNA in T3A (p\u22640.044)-and T1L-infected brains (p=0.036) (c) IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice rapidly succumb to intracranial reovirus infection. B6wt and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 were inoculated i.c. with either T1L (a), T3A (b), or T3D (c) reovirus and survival was monitored until death or for 21 days (N\u22658). IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 and B6wt survival distributions were significantly different (p<0.0001), regardless of the reovirus serotype injected. All virus serotypes were 100% lethal in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 animals by day 6. In contrast, 87% of T1Linfected B6wt animals survived to the study endpoint and T3-infected B6wt animals lived until ~11 dpi Reovirus titers are increased in the CNS and peripheral organs of IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice. B6wt and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 were inoculated i.c. with either T1L (a), T3A (b), or T3D (c) reovirus. Tissues were harvested at 4 dpi and processed for viral titer determination by plaque assay on L929 mouse fibroblasts. Both CNS and peripheral organ titers were significantly greater in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 animals. Each dot represents an organ taken from an individual animal. Horizontal lines represent group means In brain slices prepared from IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice, T3 reovirus replication and viral-induced apoptosis are enhanced. Brain slice cultures (BSCs) were prepared from 2-to 3-day-old B6wt and IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice. Cultures were infected with mock or T3 reovirus immediately upon plating. At indicated times post-infection, total RNA was purified from BSCs (N=3-4) and the reovirus L1 gene was quantified by RT-PCR. At all time points, IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 slices showed increased viral burden when compared to B6wt brain slices (a). Increased viral replication in IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 ultimately resulted in increased apoptosis at 11 dpi, as assessed by fluorogenic Caspase 3 activity assay (b)",
