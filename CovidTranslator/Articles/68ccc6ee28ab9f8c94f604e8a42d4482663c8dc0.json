The CB questionnaires used for this study used a hypothetical disaster situation of bird flu in Kyoto, Japan. Safety, event, visitor information, and price discounting policies were designed accordingly. Respondents were then asked about their willingness to travel time. The results showed the optimal timing for devising pertinent policies during the year. We found that the first step requires a safety information announcement, within one week, immediately after disaster site decontamination. The second step is the implementation of event information policy within 24th to 36th week after the disaster. The third step constitutes announcing visitor information within the 37th to 52nd week after the second step. The final step is the implementation of price discounting policy, until the 52nd week, immediately after the third step.",

The fifth and sixth stages are post-event stages, and the focus of this study. Thus, the policy effects from pre-event to the post-event stages and the feedback effects from the post-event to the pre-event stages described in Racherla and Hu (2009) are not our focus.

While micro (consumer behavior) data are frequently used for the demand analyses (Fleming & Cook, 2008; Phaneuf, Kling, & Herriges, 2000) , the difficulty of researching such data from the time series of independent consumer behaviors sometimes dissuades researchers from analyzing the dynamic processes of demand functions, especially in disaster.",

The questionnaires were sent by e-mail to 17,277 respondents who had registered with the company. Overall, 2128 of 17,277 respondents satisfied the above conditions. However, the exact response rate was unknown due to the lack of information collected by the company on the number of non-participants. Data were collected from 2128 respondents. Table 3 presents the individual characteristics of the respondents. The proportion of male respondents was 63.53%, with an average age of 42.45 years. The corresponding national survey of Japan indicated that these values were 50.17% and 41.98 years, respectively, in 2011.

Tourism experience at Kyoto (EXKYOTO) was 17.62%, but 92.6% respondents were interested in visiting Kyoto (INTKYOTO). Finally, 23.07% respondents felt anxious about the bird flu outbreak (AXBF). Table 4 shows the results of the CB questionnaires, including IP safe and IP event nosafe . The second row shows the results for combinations of policies. The third, fourth, and fifth rows show the means, standard deviations, and number of respondents who answered \"Never,\" respectively, for \u00a51000 to \u00a540,000. IP nosafe for \u00a540,000, respectively. The minimum and maximum numbers for the respondents who replied \"Never\" were 296 (the third row for IP event safe ) and 932 (the fifth row for the IP nosafe ), respectively. Finally, Table 5 shows the pooling data for the logistic simulations. Table 6 shows the reasons for rejection for 463 respondents. One hundred and sixty-three respondents answered \"Anxiety about being infected by the bird flu.\" The second and third reasons for rejection were \"Distrust safety information provided by central and local governments\" and \"Other,\" respectively.",

Most tourists were not willing to travel to disaster sites without safety information. The ordering b visitor safe > b event safe > b safe indicated that mixed policies could have a greater recovery effect over single policies. These results also supported the applicability of the CB method for estimating preferences. The findings confirmed the mixed effects of safety and other information. A pure effect of event information was that b event safe \u00c0 b safe \u00bc 0.3020 >b event nosafe . Furthermore, according to the visitor information, b visitor safe \u00c0 b safe \u00bc 0.3836 >b visitor nosafe . These results indicated that mixed policies could generate synergetic effects. Moreover, the fact that the value of b safe was larger than the pure effect values indicated that providing safety information could have the highest effect. Table 8 indicates that the parameters of information policies totally tend to increase in spending periods (although there are cases of increment and decrement by periods). For example, the estimated parameters of IP safe (b safe ) are 0.3972 in the 1st week and 0.7098 in the 52nd week, respectively. The estimated parameters of IP visitor safe (b visitor safe ) are 0.7604 in the 1st week and 1.1833 in the 52nd week, respectively. The reason could be that the respondents' anxiety toward the bird flu outbreak decreased as time passed; respondents might come to think the bird flu outbreak would not occur. Thus, the travel cost parameters (b TC ) decrease from \u00c00.0166 in the 1st week to \u00c00.0311 in the 52nd week. This indicates that the price effects are enhanced over time due to an increase in the number of willing-to-travel respondents by reducing (overcoming) their anxiety.",

Information policies could be effective at attracting these persons to travel. Otherwise, persons who were married, operating self-owned businesses, homemakers, and those educated at technical colleges were not swayed by information policies, possibly because of the fear of catching the infection themselves and/or infecting their children (the negative influence of tourists' perceived risks for tourism sites described in Law, 2006 and Rittichainuwat & Chakraborty, 2009 ). Furthermore, they could also possibly have little time to travel because of their jobs or study commitments (the substitution between work and leisure time described in Weiermair, 2006). Table 9 shows that information policies cannot help postdisaster tourism demand levels (the maximum was approximately 86.6% for SC full ) recovery to reach the pre-disaster demand level (92.6%). Overcoming the reasons for the rejection in Table 10 makes it possible for the post-disaster demand level to come close to the pre-disaster demand level (91.2% for SC allrr full ). Thus, an issue in recovering tourism demand is how to compensate for demand losses by the reasons for rejection. ",

Here, we assume two conditions: i) the policy ordering of Case 6 is employed and ii) the policies were implemented one by one. Announcing safety information in the first step as soon as possibledwithin week 1, immediately after decontaminating the disasterdwould result in faster tourism demand recovery at such sites. Since the b event safe \u00c0 b safe values decrease from the 36th to the 52nd week, it is preferable to time the second step (event information) within 24th to 36th weeks after the disaster. The increment of b visitor safe \u00c0 b safe values from the 36th to the 52nd week and condition (ii) indicated that it would be timed until the 52nd week after the 37th week for the third step timing (visitor information). Thus, it would be appropriate to implement the fourth step (price discounting) immediately after the third step due to the decrement of b TC values from the 36th to the 52nd week. In summary, it is preferable to implement announcing the safety information (the first step) within one week, the event information (the second step) within 24th to 36th week after the first step, visitor information (the third step) within 37th to 52nd week after the second step (e.g., 40th week), and the price discounting until the 52nd week immediately after the third step (e.g., 41th week).",

Second, the pricing policy, after solving a disaster, would not have a significant effect due to tourists' anxiety. Third, the optimal policy ordering and timings are determined as follows: the provision of safety information within a week, event information within 24th to 36th week after the disaster, visitor information within the 37th week to the 52nd week, and price discounting until the 52nd week immediately after the third step (e.g., 41th week).

The first is the difficulty in reducing the number of CB questionnaires when the number of policies or periods increasedthe order effect might occur by the answer format of this study. For example, the choice experiments, which could possibly implement the same analysis in this study, were not employed owing to its difficulty. The second limitation is how to design and estimate the policy effects from the pre-event to the post-event stages, and the feedback effects from the post-event to the pre-event stages, for improving disaster planning, training and education, among others. The third is to research more realistic trip information (e.g., the type and quality of accommodation, food and beverage, and distances from respondents' homes to the tourist site) in order to estimate more realistic price effects, especially in low-price level situations (\u00a51000 in hypothetical prices). The simulation results could be improved Note: the values of 40% price discounting cases are in parentheses; (\u00c0) means the 40% price discounting case was not simulated due to nontarget of simulations; the standard demand level is assumed as 92.6% in 52 weeks; the value of SC ranx&rdtrust full in 52 weeks is 0.8994 in Table 10 . by collecting these details, and thus further studies could take up these challenges. Additionally, new research could also involve adjusting the difference between real and hypothetical behaviors, and applying the proposed method to varied disaster events, such as earthquakes and tsunamis.",

Bird flu does not frequently infect humans, but it rarely does so when a person touches or is in close contact with an infected bird. In recent years, cases of H5N1 type bird flu influenza virus infection on humans has been reported and developed. The observed bird flu influenza type in Japan is H5N1. In Asian countries, it has also been reported that symptoms of seriously ill patients infected by the H5N1 type are pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction, among others, while the main symptom of mildly ill patients infected by H7N7 type observed in the Kingdom of the Netherlands is conjunctivitis. The WHO reported that 568 persons were infected, of whom 334 persons were dead from 2003 to November 2011. Another reason that public organizations pay serious attention to the bird flu is the influenza pandemic caused by various bird flu influenza viruses through infections from birds to humans. Hence, the pandemic might rapidly expand across the world. Currently, the Japanese government prevents the bird flu outbreak by euthanizing infected (or probably infected) birds. Note that the bird flu shot (vaccination) has not been implemented in Japan.",
