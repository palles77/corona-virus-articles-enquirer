Research use of mice has grown exponentially during the past and current century with the recognition of the power of the mouse for gene and comparative mapping and have made the laboratory mouse, in genetic terms, the most thoroughly characterized mammal on earth (Silver, 1995; Lyon et al., 1996; Morse, 2007a) . The current ability to create highly sophisticated, genetically engineered mice by inserting transgenes or targeted mutations into endogenous genes has also made the laboratory mouse the most widely and heavily used experimental animal.",

            "text": "Historical reviews have documented the origins of the laboratory mouse, which extend thousands of years into antiquity (Keeler, 1931; Morse, 1978; Silver, 1995) . The laboratory mouse belongs within the genus Mus, subfamily Murinae, family Muridae, superfamily Muroidea, Order Rodentia, and within the M. musculus clade collectively called the 'house mouse' (Lundrigan et al., 2002) . Anatomic features of molar teeth and cranial bones were traditionally used by zoologists to identify over 100 different species within the genus, and to differentiate them from other murids. Because of considerable phenotypic variation within a single Mus species, this approach has proven to be inaccurate, and given way to contemporary genetic analysis. The native range of the genus Mus is Eurasia and North Africa. Members of this genus are generally classified as aboriginal, consisting of species that live independent of humans, or commensal, which includes taxa that have coevolved and geographically radiated with human civilization since the dawn of agriculture 12,000 years before present (bp). This close association with human agrarian society gave rise to the genus name, derived from Sanskrit, Mush: to steal. The commensal group is known as the 'house mouse' clade, consisting of several subspecies of Mus musculus, including M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus, M. m. castaneus, M. m. bactrianus , and a lesser known lineage, M. m. gentilulus (Prager et al., 1998) . The Japanese house mouse, M. m. molossinus, is a natural hybrid of M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus. The progenitor of the M. musculus clade arose in the northern Indian subcontinent and diverged into genetically isolated and distinct species or subspecies due to geographic barriers (mountain ranges). There is debate whether these taxa are species or subspecies, and some have referred to them as 'incipient species,' but their genetic divergence is now blurring as they colonize the world and hybridize.",

It is now apparent that the M.m. musculus and M.m. castaneus contributions to the laboratory mouse genome were primarily derived from M.m. molossinus Japanese fancy mice (Takada et al., 2013) . Mus m. domesticus is indigenous to western Europe and southwest Asia, M.m. musculus to eastern Europe and northern Asia, M.m. castaneus to southeast Asia, and M.m. molossinus to Japan and the Korean peninsula. The cohabitation of humans with commensal mice gave rise to captive breeding for coat color and behavioral variants in China over 3000 years bp. By the 1700s, mouse 'fanciers' in Asia had created many varieties of fancy mice, as did European fanciers, who subsequently acquired Asian stocks, particularly Japanese fancy mice (M.m. molossinus) , to mix with European (M.m. domesticus) fancy mouse varieties. This genetic mixing for fancy variants was also occurring in the United States, and these mouse lines contributed to many of the major laboratory mice used today. Meanwhile, the European colonial expansion era contributed to the worldwide dissemination of M.m. domesticus, which now occupies every continent of the world. It is well documented that wild-caught M.m. domesticus also contributed to the genetic composition of fancy and laboratory mice on multiple occasions.",

Most inbred laboratory mice share a common maternal mitochondrial genome derived from M.m. domesticus (Ferris et al., 1982; Yu et al., 2009) , and a common Y chromosome contributed by M.m. musculus (Bishop et al., 1985) through its contribution to the genome of M.m. molossinus (Nagamine et al., 1992) . Thus, the most inclusive name that can be assigned to the genetically mosaic laboratory mouse is M. musculus, the over-arching name for the entire commensal clade. There are exceptions, however. C57BL/6 mice contain minor genetic elements derived from M. spretus (Hardies et al., 2000) , and a number of wild aboriginal species that are not members of the M. musculus clade, including M. spretus, M. caroli, and others, have been established as inbred lines of mice.",

The first autosomal genes, albino and pink-eyed dilution, were linked in 1915 (Haldane et al., 1915) . Extensive linkage maps and an impressive array of inbred strains are now available to expedite genetic research (Table 3 .1) (Lyon et al., 1996) . Mice have 20 pairs of telocentric chromosomes that are differentiated by their size and patterns of transverse bands. The chromosomes are designated by Arabic numbers in order of decreasing size. During the 1970s, chromosome rearrangements were used to assign known genetic linkage groups -identified by Roman numerals -to specific chromosomes and for determining locus order with respect to the centromere. Genes can be located physically on chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Development of quantitative trait loci (QTL) methodology for mapping genes and the similarity between mouse and human genomes have made the mouse invaluable for identifying genes and underlying complex traits that are inherent to the most common human genetic diseases (Moore and Nagle, 2000) .

            "text": "One of the most thoroughly studied genetic systems of the mouse is the histocompatibility complex. Histocompatibility (H) loci control expression of cell surface molecules that modulate critical immune responses, such as the recognition of foreign tissue. For example, the time, onset, and speed of skin graft rejection are controlled by two groups of H loci. The major group is located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, H2) on chromosome 17. The H2 complex contains several loci, including K, D, L, I-A, and I-E. Inbred strains of mice, being homozygous, each have unique sets of H2 alleles, termed H2 haplotypes. For example, the BALB H2 haplotype is H2 d and the C57BL H2 haplotype is H2 b . The International ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) Information System provides details on H2 haplotypes for various inbred mice (www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoireMHC/Polymorphism/ haplotypes/mouse/MHC/Mu_haplotypes.html). Minor H loci groups are scattered throughout the genome and are responsible for delayed graft rejection. Genes associated with the H2 complex also control other immunological functions, such as cell-cell interactions in primary immune responses and the level of response to a given antigen. Immune-mediated responses to infectious agents such as viruses and complement activity are influenced directly or indirectly by the H2 complex (Stuart, 2010) . Non-MHC or minor histocompatibility systems also are under active study (Roopenian et al., 2000) .",

The Mouse Genomes Project/Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is extending this effort to include the genomic sequences of 17 key mouse strains. Completed and evolving sequence data are available through the European Nucleotide Archive (www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/home). The burgeoning numbers of inbred mouse strains, natural mutants, induced mutants, transgenic lines, and targeted mutant lines of mice are cataloged in the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database: http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome). The growing number of mutant mice has fostered the development of a number of mouse repositories, from which specific mice can be located and acquired. In the United States, there are four regional National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (http://www.mmrrc.org), which link to international repositories in Europe, Japan, China, Australia, and Canada, as well as additional resource programs in the United States through the International Mouse Strain Resource (IMSR; http://www.informatics.jax.org/ imsr/index.jsp) for depositing, archiving, and distributing mutant mouse and embryonic stem cell lines to the scientific community. In addition to numerous mutant mice produced independently by scientists in various academic institutions, three major targeted gene knockout programs, all utilizing C57BL/6N embryonic stem cells, are under way internationally, and funded by the NIH, the European Community, and Genome Canada (Collins et al., 2007; Skarnes et al., 2011) . These include the Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP; http://www.knockoutmouse.org), the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program (EUCOMM; http://www.eucomm.org), and the North American Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Project (NorCOMM; http://norcomm.phenogenomics.ca/index. htm). These mouse lines will be available through LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE three distribution centers: the German Resource Center for Genome Research (RZPD; http://www.rzpd.de), the KOMP repository (https://komp.org), and the Canadian Mouse Consortium (CMC; http://www.mousecanada. ca/index.htm). The repositories are all linked to the IMSR, and provide access to mice, germplasm, genomic detail, and phenotypic data.

Because of residual heterozygosity, a strain is not fully inbred until after 60 F generations. Most commonly used inbred mouse strains represent 200 or more F generations, providing a high degree of experimental reproducibility. The mouse genome is not static, so when branches of an inbred strain are separated, spontaneous mutations, residual heterozygosity, and retroelement integrations result in genetic differences. Therefore, if branches of an inbred strain are separated before F 40 , if branches have separated for 100 generations, or if genetic differences arise, the different branches become substrains. The same holds true if branches of a substrain diverge, resulting in substrains of the inbred substrain.",

RI mice are useful for mapping phenotypic or quantitative traits that differ between the progenitor strains (Bailey, 1971) . RI sets are generally limited to two parental strains. An ongoing international effort has been undertaken to increase allelic diversity among RI strains by creating the Collaborative Cross (CC) in which a panel of RI strains are being generated mixing the genomes from eight disparately related inbred (octo-parental) mouse strains, including A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, nonobese diabetic (NOD)/ShiLtJ, NZO/ HlLtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ.

            "text": "When a mutation arises spontaneously or is induced within an inbred strain, that mutant mouse becomes co-isogenic with the parental inbred strain, being virtually identical except for the single mutant allele. Frequently, a mutation that arose in one inbred strain may be desired within the genetic background of another inbred strain. This can be accomplished by backcrossing, in which an F 1 hybrid is created by mating the donor mutant strain to the desired background strain, with subsequent matings to the background strain while retaining the mutant locus. After 10 backcross generations (N generations), the mutant mouse line is now congenic to the background inbred strain. Backcrossing to create congenic strains of mice has been used extensively when targeted mutations have been induced in 129 embryonic stem cells, with backcrossing onto C57BL/6 inbred mice. Congenic mice are never co-isogenic, as the preserved locus in a congenic mouse is invariably surrounded by flanking DNA, which may significantly influence phenotype (Linder, 2006) . In contrast to inbred mice, outbred mice are genetically heterogeneous and are maintained by breeding systems that intentionally minimize inbreeding. Outbred mice are called stocks, which are defined as a closed population (for at least four generations) of genetically variable mice that are bred to maintain maximal heterozygosity. Outbred mice may be used when high genetic heterogeneity is desired or for experiments requiring large numbers of mice. Outbreeding can be achieved only in a large breeding population using a systematic breeding scheme, or randomized selection of breeders from the population. A small breeding population or passage through the genetic 'bottleneck' of rederivation to improve health status will reduce genetic heterogeneity and lead eventually to some degree of inbreeding. In a population of 25 breeding pairs, e.g., heterozygosity will decrease at 1% per generation with standard randomization techniques. Random breeding involves the statistically random selection of breeders by using a random numbers table or computer program. An outbreeding program that is easy to manage is the circular pair mating system, in which each pair is mated only once. Conceptually, cages are visualized in a circle, and each cage contains one breeding pair in the nth generation. Another 'circular' set of cages serves as the breeding nucleus for the n + 1 generation. Each mated pair in the nth generation contributes one female and one male to the n + 1 generation. Outbreeding is accomplished by assigning the female and male derived from each nth generation cage to different cages in the n + 1 generation.",

Although considered outbred, they have a high degree of homozygosity, exemplified by the fact that many Swiss mouse stocks are blind due to the homozygous recessive rd1 allele (Serfilippi et al., 2004b) . It is preferable to ensure genetic heterogeneity by intercrossing multiple inbred strains to achieve heterogeneity with known genetic input.

However, the term transgenic commonly refers to mice that are genetically altered by additive transgenesis through microinjection of foreign DNA into the pronucleus of a fertilized egg. Each ensuing embryo results in a genetically different founder mouse, since the transgene is integrated in random sites of the genome of each founder mouse. Since the injected DNA is not homologous to the mouse genome and is not an allele, transgenic founders are hemizygous (rather than heterozygous) for the transgene until the mice carrying the transgene are bred into homozygosity for the transgene. Transgenes typically integrate as tandem repeats, copy numbers affect phenotype of each founder, and may be lost in subsequent generations, thereby changing the phenotype of the mouse line (Tinkle and Jay, 2002) . Transgenes are often constructed with an upstream promoter, which confers widespread (ubiquitous) or tissuespecific expression of the cDNA, so that the transgene expression pattern reflects the expression pattern of the promoter. Transcriptional regulation of the transgene can be inducible by drug-dependent regulatory control, such as the widely used tetracycline (tet) regulatory system, in which treatment of mice with tetracycline or doxycycline induces up-or down-regulation of the transgene (Jaisser, 2000) .",

Gene trapping is a high-throughput approach that randomly introduces insertional mutations within the genome. Vectors contain a gene trapping cassette with a promoter-less reporter gene and/or selectable genetic marker flanked by an upstream 3\u2032 splice site and a downstream termination sequence. When inserted into an LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE intron of an expressed gene, the gene trap is transcribed from the endogenous promoter of that gene.

Homologous sequences flank the upstream and downstream regions of the targeted gene, and the construct between the flanking sequences may inactivate (knock out) or replace (knock in) a gene, and typically contains a reporter gene to track the integration. A variation on this approach is site-specific recombinase (SSR) technology. Two of the most common recombinases are Cre from the coliphage P1 and FLP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cre and FLP mediate recombination between target sites, termed loxP and FRT, respectively. For example, Cre loxP target sites are engineered to flank the gene target, which can be used in different ways to achieve different outcomes (conditional mutations), depending upon the orientation and location of the flanking loxP sites. If the loxP sites are oriented in opposite directions, Cre recombinase mediates inversion of the floxed segment. If the loxP sites are on different chromosomes (trans), Cre recombinase mediates a chromosomal translocation. If the loxP sites are oriented in the same direction on the same chromosome (cis), Cre recombinase mediates deletion of the floxed segment. Once the floxed mutation is created in ES cells, the transformed ES cells are developed into a mouse with the conditional mutation. The conditional mutant mouse is then genetically crossed with a Cre transgenic mouse, in which Cre recombinase is under the control of a ubiquitous or tissue-specific promoter. Wherever and whenever Cre is expressed, Cre recombinase will recognize and recombine the loxP sites. This approach can include insertion of reporter genes and selectable markers, and can be under the control of inducible gene expression systems (http:// www.eucomm.org/docs/protocols/mouse_protocol_1_ Sanger) (Nagy, 2000) .",

Interest in 'embryonal carcinomas' (teratomas) that arose in relatively high frequency in the testes of 129 mice and early gene transfer experiments in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to the development of ES cell lines derived from several different 129 strains. This early emphasis on teratomas prompted creation of 'better' 129 mouse lines that were more prone to development of testicular teratomas, resulting in genetic corruption of the 129 mouse (Simpson et al., 1997; Threadgill et al., 1997) . This realization gave rise to the need to revise 129 mouse nomenclature (Festing et al., 1999) . This was necessary because genetic variation significantly impacts homologous recombination in order to match genome sequence of the ES cell line with the mouse from which it was derived. ES cells can be created from any mouse strain or hybrid, but 129 ES cell lines have been commonly used. Recent international knockout mouse program efforts use C57BL/6N ES cells.",

The pups that are born are composed of a mixture of cells derived from recipient blastocysts and the transformed ES cells (chimeras). The goal is for male chimeric progeny to produce spermatozoa of ES cell origin (containing the mutation), in order to create F 1 progeny by mating the chimera with the desired background strain (http://www.eucomm.org/docs/protocols/mouse_protocol_1_Sanger). For this reason, most ES cell lines are XY, which favors 129 male chimerism. If the ES cells are of 129 (or other) strain origin, the chimeras are often bred to a desired background mouse strain (commonly C57BL/6) and backcrossed for N10 generations, thereby creating congenic inbred mouse lines. Recent international knockout mouse efforts utilize C57BL/6N ES cells, so that chimeric males are bred directly with C57BL/6 mice, thereby creating co-isogenic lines. The latter approach saves time and money, and creates a more genetically refined mutant mouse. An alternate approach is to allow ES cells to aggregate with a developing embryo to form blastocysts in culture (aggregation chimera), then implant the chimeric blastocysts (Tanaka et al., 2001) .",

The dsRNA is enzymatically processed into small molecules, termed small interfering RNA (siRNA), which find homologous target mRNAs, resulting in interference. This phenomenon is believed to be a self-defense mechanism against viral infection. In order to adapt this approach to generation of transgenic mice, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) can be expressed in the same way as other transgenes in mice, resulting in processing of the shRNA into siRNA with gene-silencing effects. Constructs are introduced into mouse ES cells by electroporation or lentiviral infection. This method can be embellished conditionally, as with other transgenes. Although RNAi knockdown mice are genetically stable, RNAi-mediated transgenesis is never complete, has variable tissue expression, and cannot induce point mutations (Peng et al., 2006) .",

ZFNs are comprised of three to six tandem zinc finger proteins, each of which targets a specific 3 bp nucleotide sequence. Paired ZFNs are generated, with each half of the pair targeting opposite DNA strands, allowing dimerization of Fok1 which is required for introduction of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in the DNA of interest (Cathomen and Joung, 2008) . TALENs function similarly, but are composed of tandem repeats of 33-35 amino acids, each with nucleotide specificity occurring in two hypervariable amino acids, the 'repeat variable di-residue (RVD)', at positions 12 and 13 (Joung and Sander, 2013) .",

HR is a less common repair pathway, but certain manipulations of the engineered nucleases can increase HR efficiency.

            "text": "Inbred mouse strains are designated by a series of capital letters and/or numbers, which often provide a shorthand description of the origin and history of the strain. The C57BL/6J mouse serves as an example. The inbred strain C57BL originated from Abbie Lathrop's female 57 (and male 52) at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (C), and was the black (BL) line from this female. Early in their history, inbred C57BL mice split into major substrains, e.g., C57BL/6 and C57BL/10. Substrains are identified by appending a forward slash (/) after the inbred strain name. Since 1950, uniform international nomenclature has been built upon these historical names, so that substrains of an inbred strain are now designated using lab codes that are registered in the International Laboratory Code Registry maintained at the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) of the National Academies (dels. nas.edu/global/ilar/Lab-codes). Laboratory codes are composed of one to five letters that identify an institute, laboratory, or investigator. Each lab code starts with an uppercase letter, followed by lowercase letters if more than one letter is used (such as N, J, Jci, Crl, and Tac). The J in C57BL/6J means it is a substrain maintained at the Jackson Laboratory (J). Another common substrain of C57BL/6 mice is C57BL/6N, which is maintained at NIH (N). Substrains can be cumulative, reflecting the genetic history of the mouse strain. For example, there are a number of C57BL/6J substrains (such as C57BL/6JJci and C57BL/6JJmsSlc), and a number of C57BL/6N substrains (such as C57BL/6NJci, C57BL/6NCrlCrlj, ",

Significant differences may exist among these substrains (Mekada et al., 2009 ). Thus, a string of substrain designations indicate the genetic progression of the substrain, which can be identified when reading the entire strain name. This nomenclature is highly nuanced, as C57BL/6NCrlCrlj mice, whose last letter is a lowercase j, are not a substrain maintained at the Jackson Laboratory (J), but rather at Charles River Japan (Crlj), underscoring the importance of upper-and lowercase lettering in rodent nomenclature. BALB/c mice are another popular inbred strain with numerous substrains. Like the '6' in C57BL/6, the 'c' that follows LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE of the mutational event as a superscript. For example, Cftr tm1Unc is a targeted mutation (tm), first line (1) Congenic mice are often derived from 129 ES cells, backcrossed onto a background strain, such as C57BL/6. Under such circumstances, when the backcross generation is at N10, the '.' symbol is used between the background inbred strain and the donor strain (e.g., C57BL/6N.129P2/OlaHsd-Abc tm1Zzz , abbreviated as B6.129-Abc tm1Zzz . When backcrossing is incomplete but at the N5 generation, the mouse is an incipient congenic, designated with a ';' in lieu of a '.': B6;129-Abc tm1Zzz . If the background strain is mixed genetic origin, it is designated STOCK.129-Abc tm1Zzz . If the donor strain is mixed origin, it is designated 'Cg'. For example, B6.Cg-Abc tm1Zzz outbred stock that meets specific criteria is designated by placing the Lab Code before the stock symbol, separated by a full colon (':'). For example, Hsd:ICR designates an ICR (Swiss) outbred stock maintained by Harlan Sprague Dawley (Hsd).",

The emerging interest in the mouse microbiome in combination with the immune competency of diverse genetically engineered mouse strains demands high standards of mouse care. Mouse colonies are optimally maintained as specificpathogen-free (SPF) which obligates veterinary and facility management to exclude specific organisms. Housing options for SPF immunocompetent mice typically include static or individually ventilated microisolator cages, which differ significantly in cost and labor required to maintain. Severely immunodeficient strains such as NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice require staff training, caging systems and husbandry practices that minimize risk for opportunistic infections the '/' in BALB/c is a lowercase letter because of historical precedent. Subsequent substrains follow accepted nomenclature, e.g., BALB/cByJ and BALB/cAnN. Hybrids of two inbred strains are often used in research, and are particularly common with engineered mutations that are created in 129-derived ES cells, followed by intercrossing the 129 chimeric mice with C57BL/6 or other background strains of mouse. When an F 1 hybrid is created, the female partner is listed first, e.g., a C57BL/6J \u00d7 129S2/SvPas hybrid would be designated: C57BL/6J129S2/SvPasF1. RI strain sets that are derived from two parental inbred strains are identified by an X between the two parental strains followed by a hyphen designating the specific RI line, e.g., C57BL/6JXDBA/2J-1, C57BL/6JXDBA/2J-2, etc. CC RI strains do not use the X between the parental strains because they are derived from eight parental strains, so they are designated CC-1, CC-2, etc. In order to simplify the complexity of this nomenclature, abbreviations are used for common inbred strains and substrains of mice (Table 3 .4), but it is important to include the full genetic nomenclature in publications. Using the abbreviated nomenclature, C57BL/6J129S2/SvPasF1 mice would be B6129F1 and C57BL/6JXDBA/2J-1 RI mice would be BXD-1. Parental order is an important consideration in nomenclature, as a B6129 mouse is genetically different from a 129B6 mouse due to mitochondrial DNA (from the female) and Y chromosome (from the male) differences.",

Vendors often successfully house production colonies in open-top cages to expedite detection of pathogen transmission should a break occur.

The objective is to keep mice in an uncrowded, socially compatible, low-odor, dry and clean environment. Ambient temperature should minimize any confounding impact on the animal model and energy expenditure for the mice, while also being suitable for staff and investigators. Shoebox static cages made of polycarbonate, polypropylene, or polystyrene plastic (in order of decreasing cost and durability) with filtered microisolator tops continue to be used for housing and breeding mice. Older cage designs are being rapidly supplanted by individually ventilated caging systems that promote the advantages of increasing housing capacity, decreasing labor costs, and mitigating exposure of mice to noxious gases such as ammonia and exposure of humans to allergens. As more advanced caging systems are developed, the level of biosecurity may be increased but at the cost of increased health surveillance efforts to detect the source of an infectious outbreak (Shek, 2008) .

This equipment can be negatively pressurized when the objective is to contain known or unknown pathogens.

For certain studies, it is desirable to colonize germfree mice with a defined microbiota. In the mid-1960s, Schaedler was the first to colonize germfree mice with selected bacteria isolated from normal mice (Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983) . He subsequently supplied animal breeders with this group of microorganisms. These defined bacteria included aerobic bacteria and some less oxygen-sensitive anaerobic organisms. The so-called extremely oxygen-sensitive (EOS) fusiform bacteria, which make up the majority of the normal microbiota of rodents, were not included, because of technical difficulties in isolation and cultivation. Of the defined microbiotas later used for gnotobiotic studies, the one known as the 'Schaedler flora' was the most popular. In 1978, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) decided to revise the Schaedler flora, or 'cocktail' consisting of eight bacteria, in order to standardize the microbiota used to colonize germfree rodents. The new defined microbiota, now known as the 'altered Schaedler flora' (ASF), consisted of four members of the original Schaedler flora (two lactobacilli, Bacteroides distasonis, and the EOS fusiform bacterium), a spiral-shaped bacterium, and three new fusiform EOS bacteria. Studies have quantified the regional colonization of the ASF strains along the gastrointestinal tract (Sarma-Rupavtarm et al., 2004) (Fig. 3.4) . Individual strain abundance was dependent on oxygen sensitivity, with microaerotolerant Lactobacillus murinus ASF361 present at 10 5 -10 7 cells/g of tissue in the upper gastrointestinal tract and obligate anaerobic ASF strains being predominant in the cecal and colonic flora at 10 8 -10 10 cells/g of tissue.",

It is necessary to demonstrate that microorganisms of the specified microbiota are present and that adventitious microorganisms are absent. In the past, monitoring relied on bacterial morphology, limited evaluation of biochemical traits, and growth characteristics. With the advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, the eight ASF strains were identified taxonomically by 16S rRNA sequence analysis . Three strains were previously identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain ASF 360), L. salivarius (strain ASF 361), and Bacteroides distasonis (strain ASF 519), based on phenotypic criteria. 16S rRNA analysis and genome sequencing indicated that each of the strains differed from its presumptive identity (Wannemuehler et al., 2014) . The 16S rRNA sequence of strain ASF 361 is essentially identical to the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of L. murinus and L. animalis (both isolated LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE from mice), and all of these strains probably belong to a single species. Strain ASF 360 is a novel lactobacillus that clusters with L. acidophilus and L. lactis. Strain ASF 519 is a Parabacteroides sp. The spiral-shaped strain, strain ASF 457, is in the Flexistipes phylum, exhibits sequence identity with rodent isolates of Robertson, and has been formally named, Mucispirillum schaedleri (Robertson et al., 2005) . The remaining four ASF strains, which are EOS fusiform bacteria, group phylogenetically with the low-G + C content gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes, Bacillus-Clostridium group) (ASF 492 -Eubacterium plexicaudatium; ASF 500 -Firmicutes bacterium; ASF 502 and ASF 356 -Clostridium sp.) (Fig. 3.5) . The 16S rRNA sequence information was determined by Dewhirst et al. (1999) and draft genome sequences for each member of ASF were recently published (Wannemuehler et al., 2014) . This genetic data will permit detailed analysis of the interactions of ASF organisms during development of intestinal disease in mice that are coinfected with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms.",

Thymectomy in adult mice produces no immediate effect, but several months later mice may develop a progressive decline of circulating lymphocytes and impaired cellular immune responses. The mutant athymic nude mouse is a powerful experimental tool in the study of the thymus in immune regulation (Fogh, 1982) .",

The hypophysis is usually responsive to hormonal influence by day 6 in the male and day 12 in the female. Ovarian follicle development begins at 3 weeks of age and matures by 30 days. Rising levels of gonadotropins evoke signs of sexual maturity at about the same age. In the female, estrogen-dependent changes such as cornification of vaginal epithelium at the vaginal opening can occur as early as 24-28 days. Puberty is slightly later in the male (up to 2 weeks). Sexual maturation varies among strains and stocks of mice and is subject to seasonal and environmental influences.

Wild mice aggregate into groups called demes with low exchange of individuals between different groups. Each deme consists of kinrelated members with a high degree of natural inbreeding, higher mutation rates compared to other mammals, and a wide range of developmental flexibility based on early life experience, which all contribute to their remarkably successful environmental adaptability. The deme is composed of a dominant breeding male, a hierarchy of females, subordinate males, and juveniles. Wild mice occupy territories measuring just a few square meters when food is abundant to several square kilometers. Mice are crepuscular (active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk), strongly territorial, and omnivorous. Coprophagy contributes to approximately one-third of their ingesta as an essential nutritional activity. Aside from territoriality, social interactions, breeding, burrowing (when conducive substrates are available), and nest building are major activities. In managing laboratory mice, it is important to understand the complex behavioral biology of their free-living counterparts (Latham and Mason, 2004) .",

Chromosome 4 contains a cluster of 21 Mup genes, plus a number of pseudogenes. Mups are small soluble proteins known as lipocalins, which bind small organic chemicals (pheromones) with high affinity, and function as pheromone transporters and stabilizers (thereby contributing to slow release), but also act as protein pheromones themselves. They are synthesized in the liver and excreted in the urine, as well as nasal mucosa, lacrimal glands, and salivary glands. Their endogenous role on metabolic activity is not yet understood. Male mice excrete significantly more Mups in the urine than females. One wellcharacterized Mup is 'darcin', named after Fitzwilliam Darcy, the romantic hero in Pride and Prejudice. As its name implies, it is a female attractant. Mups also act as kairomones, which function as chemical signals between species. For example, cat and rat Mups invoke fear in mice. Mups are important in the laboratory animal management context, as they are excreted in copious amounts (1-5 mg/ml in urine) and are potent allergens for humans, particularly Mus m 1 (Ag1 or MA1), which is encoded by the Mup 17 gene (Sharrow et al., 2001) .",

It is clear that this rich complexity cannot be fully addressed under laboratory conditions, but that does not mean that basic needs, such as nest building, burrowing, foraging, and olfactory environments, cannot be provided. For example, intermale aggression, which is particularly apparent in some strains of mice such as BALB/c and Swiss-origin stocks and strains, can be minimized by maintaining males from infancy as sibling groups, since adult siblings tend not be aggressive to one another. This sibling bond, however, can be easily broken by short-term separation. Environmental enrichment often features provision of plastic houses, which may make vivarium managers feel good, but maximal enrichment can be provided by provision of nesting material, which includes structural scaffolding, such as crinkled cardboard, which facilitates construction of three-dimensional nests. Mouse nests are replete with 'appeasement' pheromones, thereby contributing to harmony within the cage, whereas introduction of dirty bedding has the opposite effect. Frequent cage changing, including removal of established nests, is highly stressful and disruptive to social harmony within a cage. Provision of appropriate and adequate amounts of bedding material that is conducive to burrowing is desirable. It is important to remember that mice are socially gregarious, and that mouse welfare is optimally enriched by other mice within a socially harmonious deme (Latham and Mason, 2004; Van Loo et al., 2003) .",

Receptors include the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR4 (recognizing LPS), TLR3/7 (ss and dsRNA) and TLR9 (DNA), NOD-like receptors (NOD1/2), and RIG-like receptors (RIG-I, MDA-5) among others (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010) . Cells of the innate immune system are monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes and dendritic cells as well as innate-like lymphocyte populations (ILC) 1, 2 and 3, which include natural killer (NK) cells (Spits et al., 2013) . Cells of the adaptive immune system (T and B lymphocytes) express a highly antigen-specific receptor that has arisen through gene rearrangement (T-cell and B-cell receptors, respectively). B cells of the B-1 lineage and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are regarded as innate-like cells, as they express a rearranged antigen receptor but seem to respond in an innate-like manner.",

Identification of a unique receptor by one or more mAb of the same specificity leads to the assignment of a receptor name, as a 'cluster of differentiation (CD)'. For example, T cells are differentiated into two subsets based on their expression of either CD4 or CD8. CD4 + T cells (T helper cells) recognize peptides presented in MHC class II and promote B-lymphocyte activation and activate and regulate cellular immune responses via secretion of differing cytokines (see below). CD8 + T cells recognize antigenic peptides presented in MHC class I and serve as cytotoxic cells during the cell-mediated immune response where they can destroy infected cells (e.g., against cells containing infectious agents).",

Five LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE classes or Ig 'isotypes' can be distinguished, which differ in effector function: IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgD. The latter is expressed only on the surface of B cells in mice. The IgG class, the most abundant antibody class in the serum, is further divided into subtypes: IgG 1 , IgG 2a/c , IgG 2b , and IgG 3 . Polymorphisms exist on the Ig locus such that some strains of mice produce the IgG2a subtype (e.g., BALB/c), whereas others produce IgG2c (e.g., C57BL/6) (Zhang et al., 2012) . Additional allelic polymorphisms of the locus also exist. For example, BALB/c and 129SV mice express the Igh-a allotype, whereas C57BL/6 mice express the Igh-b allotype. Recombinant inbred strains of mice exist for both BALB/c and C57BL/6, which harbor the reciprocal Igh locus (i.e., Igh-b for BALB/c and Igh-a for C57BL/6 mice). These mice are useful tools for tracking B cells following adaptive cell transfer via allotype-specific mAb (see below).",

Immune effector responses differ depending on the life cycle (facultative or obligate intracellular, extracellular, localized, systemic, etc.) and antigen types displayed by the encountered antigen/ pathogen, because this affects the type of PRR engaged and activated. PRR engagement leads to cytokine and chemokine responses by the first responders, i.e., epithelial cells, local macrophage populations and other innate cells. The type of cytokines and chemokines produced then dictates the types of cells recruited to the site of infection and their subsequent differentiation and functions. The PRR engagement also leads to antigen uptake, activation and migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the site of insult to the regional lymph nodes, where DCs present antigen peptides on MHC molecules to T cells. In addition, the DCs secrete cytokines induced by the initial PRR activation, which cause the differentiation of CD4 T cells towards a particular effector response. For example, secretion of IL-12 in response to activation of TLR2 or 4 will result in the induction of interferongamma (IFN-\u03b3) production by CD4 T cells, whereas IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 production by DC will induce CD4 T cells to secrete IL-17 (Kara et al., 2014) . Because the DC translates signals from PRR at the site of infection into differentiation signals for T cells in the lymph tissues, these cells are regarded as a 'bridge' between the innate and adaptive immune systems.",

Diagnostic methods involve gross and microscopic pathology, parasitology, microbial isolation and culture, serology, and PCR. Serology is particularly important for viral surveillance, and now relies principally on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex fluorescent immunoassay (MFI) for simultaneous detection of antibodies to multiple agents (Hsu et al., 2007) , indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, or hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), with the latter two methods generally used for confirmation (Livingston and Riley, 2003; Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009) .

The original isolate of ECTV, known as the Hampstead strain, was discovered by J. Marchal in 1930 (Marchal, 1930 as the cause of epizootic disease among laboratory mice in England. The disease featured amputation of extremities, which Marchal termed ectromelia (from the Greek, ectro, amputation and melia, limb). Other strains of the virus include Moscow, NIH-79, Washington University, St. Louis 69, Beijing 70, Ishibahsi I-III, and Naval (NAV) strains, which vary in virulence, but are essentially indistinguishable genetically and serologically, suggesting a common origin. Virus can be isolated from infected tissues by inoculation of cell cultures (BS-C-1, HeLa, L cells) or embryonated eggs. The natural host (and original source of infection of laboratory mice) of ECTV remains unknown.",

During natural epizootics, it was observed that A, BC, DBA/1, DBA/2, and CBA strains developed acute fatal infections, whereas C57BL/6 mice were resistant to severe disease (Briody, 1966) . Experimental studies have shown that all strains of mice are susceptible to infection, but BALB/c, A, DBA/2, and C3H/He mice were highly susceptible, AKR and SJL mice were moderately susceptible, and C57BL/6 mice were highly resistant to lethal infection (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987c; Wallace and Buller, 1985) . The mechanisms of genetic resistance are not fully understood but appear to reflect multiple genes, some of which appear to be expressed through lymphoreticular cells, including NK cells (Brownstein et al., 1991a; Jacoby et al., 1989) . The nuances of cytokine and cellular immune responses to ECTV infection have received recent attention (reviewed in Buller and Fenner (2007) and Esteban and Buller (2005) ). Outbreaks among susceptible mice are often volatile, with variable morbidity and high mortality in susceptible strains of mice. Clinical signs such as ruffled fur or prostration may occur for only a few hours before death. Mice that survive acute infection may develop chronic disease characterized by a focal or generalized rash anywhere on the body ( Fig. 3 .12). Conjunctivitis also may occur. Skin lesions usually recede within several weeks, but hairless scars may remain. Additionally, severe viral infection of the feet and tail during the rash syndrome can lead to necrosis and amputation.",

            "text": "Epizootiology Mousepox is not a common disease. Outbreaks occur sporadically and recent outbreaks have been traced to the importation of contaminated mice or mouse products. For example, contaminated mouse serum was responsible for recent outbreaks in the United States (Dick et al., 1996; . Natural exposure is thought to occur through direct contact and skin abrasions. Cage-to-cage transmission is low and can be virtually nil if filter-topped cages are used (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987b) . Ectromelia virus is highly stable at room temperature, especially under dry conditions, leading to the potential for prolonged environmental contamination in infected colonies (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987d) . Aerogenic exposure is not a major factor in natural outbreaks, and arthropod-borne transmission does not appear to occur. Virus-free progeny can be obtained LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE from immune dams (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987b) . However, intrauterine infection and fetal deaths, albeit rare, have been reported. Natural transmission is facilitated by intermediately resistant mice, which survive long enough to develop skin lesions that can shed virus for relatively long periods of time. The risks for transmission are further increased by persistence of infectious virus in excreta and exfoliated scabs. Although virus excretion typically lasts for about 3 weeks, virus has been found in scabs and/or feces for up to 16 weeks. Resistant mouse strains also are dangerous because they can shed virus during subclinical infections. However, infections in resistant mice tend to be short-lived. Highly susceptible mice are a relatively small hazard for dissemination of infection, if properly discarded, because they die before virus shedding becomes prominent. Thus, juxtaposition of resistant or intermediately resistant infected mice with highly susceptible mice can provoke explosive outbreaks. Infant and aged mice are usually more susceptible to lethal infection than young adult mice. Maternal immunity among enzootically infected breeding mice may perpetuate infection by protecting young mice from death, but not from infection. Such mice may subsequently transmit infection by contact exposure.",

ECTV multiplies in the cell cytoplasm and produces two types of inclusion bodies. The A type (Marchal body) is well demarcated and acidophilic in histological sections. It is found primarily in epithelial cells of skin ( Fig. 3 .14) or mucous membranes and can also be found in intestinal mucosa. The B type of inclusion is basophilic and can be found in all ectromelia-infected cells. However, it is difficult to visualize unless cells are stained intensely with hematoxylin.

Tissues, supplies, instruments, or other items that have had potential contact with infected mice should be disinfected by heat or chemicals such as formalin, sodium hypochlorite, or chlorine dioxide. Materials should be autoclaved or, preferably, incinerated. Disinfected rooms should be challenged with susceptible sentinel animals that are observed for clinical signs and tested for seroconversion after several weeks. Depopulation and disinfection must be carried out vigorously. Because modern housing and husbandry methods based on the use of microbarrier caging are effective for containing infection, testing and culling properly isolated mice is a potential alternative, especially for irreplaceable breeding mice. Such mice can be quarantined along with cessation of breeding to permit resolution of infection (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987b) . Sequential testing with contact-exposed sentinels should be employed with this option. Additionally, maternal immunity from fully recovered dams can protect mice from infection, thereby enhancing opportunities to derive virus-free mice from previously infected dams, with the caveat that progeny will be transiently seropositive with maternally derived antibody.",

Immunodeficient mice, however, remain susceptible to pathogenic infection as adults. Persistent infection often affects the salivary glands and pancreas. The persistence of salivary gland infection appears to be dose dependent.

MPV was initially isolated following its detection as a lymphocytotropic contaminant in in vitro assays for cellular immunity. The virus grew lytically in a CD8 + T-cell clone designated L3 and inhibited the proliferation of cloned T cells stimulated with antigen or interleukin 2 (IL-2) (McKisic et al., 1993) . Molecular analysis of MPV indicates that regions encoding the NS proteins are similar to those of MVM (and other rodent parvoviruses). However, they differ significantly in regions encoding the capsid proteins, accounting for their antigenic specificity. The prototype isolate was first called an 'orphan' parvovirus of mice because its biology and significance were obscure, but it has subsequently been named mouse parvovirus (MPV). Immortalized T cells (L3) are the only cells found thus far to support replication of MPV. There are three genetically distinct variants of MPV, including MPV-1, MPV-2, and MPV-3. MPV-1 includes a number of closely related variants, including MPV-1a, MPV-1b, and MPV-1c. In addition, a hamster parvovirus isolate is closely related to MPV-3, which is infectious to mice and likely to be of mouse origin (Besselsen et al., 2006; Christie et al., 2010) .",

In situ hybridization has identified the small intestine as a site of viral entry and early replication, but respiratory infection cannot be excluded. Experimental studies following inoculation of neonatal BALB/c and C.B-17-Prkdc scid (SCID) mice revealed that BALB/c mice shed high levels of virus for 3 weeks, with transmission to sentinels exposed during the first 2 weeks of infection. Thereafter, BALB/c mice shed extremely low virus intermittently. In contrast, SCID mice shed high levels of virus until weaning, but lower levels at 6 weeks of age, yet they effectively transmitted infection to sentinels at all stages of infection (Besselsen et al., 2007) . Others have shown that transmission of MPV by Sencar mice inoculated as infants was intermittent up to 6 weeks, whereas transmission by mice inoculated as weanlings occurred during the first 2 weeks of infection . Transmission to BALB/c progeny from infected dams was shown to occur, but embryo transfer rederivation was found to be successful in experimentally infected SCID mice (Besselsen et al., 2008) . Humoral (e.g., passively or maternally acquired) immunity can protect against MPV infection. However, immunity to MVM may not confer cross-immunity to MPV (Hansen et al., 1999) .",

For mice that are not easily replaced, virus persistence in the absence of transplacental transmission favors cesarean rederivation or embryo transfer as relatively rapid options to eliminate infection. Control of infection also should include environmental decontamination. Chemical disinfection of suspect animal rooms and heat sterilization of caging and other housing equipment are prudent steps. Prevention is based on sound serological monitoring of mice and surveillance of biologicals destined for inoculation of mice. With the increasing use of mouse germplasm, it is important to note that mouse sperm, oocytes, ovarian tissue, and preimplantation embryos from enzootically MPVinfected mouse colonies may have a high prevalence of MPV contamination, based upon PCR (Agca et al., 2007) .",

Dyspnea occurs from pulmonary infection because of edema and hemorrhage. Infection of immunocompetent adult mice is subclinical and results in a vigorous immune response. However, both adults and infant mice develop persistent infection. The primary organ for persistence is the kidney, with shedding of virus from tubular epithelium, and shedding can be reactivated by immunosuppression (Greenlee et al., 1991) . Additionally, infection of athymic mice can lead to clinical signs and lesions akin to those described for neonatally inoculated mice. Gross lesions are limited to pulmonary hemorrhage and edema. Histologically, intranuclear inclusions, which are visualized more easily using immunohistochemistry, are present in vascular endothelium of infected tissues.

Virus also escapes immune clearance by evolution of neutralizing antibody-resistant quasi-species. No lesions are seen in naturally infected mice. The only significant lesion that can arise from experimental infection is poliomyelitis. This syndrome requires a combination of immunosuppression (due to age, genetics or induced means), mouse strain (C58, AKR, C3H/Fg, and PL), neurotropic LDV strains, and endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus. The mouse strain-dependent element is homozygosity for the Fv-1 n allele, which permits replication of endogenous N-tropic ectotropic murine leukemia virus. Mice develop spongiosis, neuronal necrosis, and astrocytosis of the ventral spinal cord and brain stem, with axonal degeneration of ventral roots. Lesions contain both LDV and retrovirus.

Since LCMV is non-cytolytic in and of itself is minimally pathogenic, congenitally infected mice grow into adulthood, reproduce, and therefore transmit infection to the next generation. However, with age, immune tolerance breaks down, and mice develop a syndrome known as 'late disease' in which mice will progressively lose weight and die. In utero infection results in a low level of fetal mortality and maternal cannibalism of infected pups. The immune tolerance to LCMV is virus-specific, with the mice capable of eliciting effective immune responses against other agents.",

Sudden death may result or subacute illness associated with one or more of the following signs may develop: ruffled fur, hunched posture, motionlessness, and neurological deficits. Mice suspended by the tail display coarse tremors of the head and extremities, culminating in clonic convulsions and tonic extension of the rear legs. Spontaneous convulsions also can occur. Animals usually die or recover in several days. A visceral form of infection can occur in adult mice inoculated by peripheral routes with 'viscerotropic' strains. It can be subclinical or lead to clinical signs, including ruffled fur, conjunctivitis, ascites, somnolescence, and death. If mice survive, recovery may take several weeks. Surviving mice may have immune exhaustion due to consumption of lymphoid tissue, in contrast to immune tolerance that occurs when mice are infected in utero or as neonates. Runting and death from LCMV infection may occur in neonatally infected mice and can lead to transient illness or to death. Clinical signs are nonspecific, recovery is slow, and survivors may remain runted. This early form of disease is attributed to endocrine dysfunction caused LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE by LCMV infection.

Among common laboratory species, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection, but only the mouse and the hamster are known to transmit virus. LCMV infection is rare in laboratory mice produced and maintained in modern quarters (Livingston and Riley, 2003; Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009) . Infection is usually introduced through inoculation of virusinfected biologicals, such as transplantable tumors, or by feral mice. Wild mice are a natural reservoir of infection and a potential threat to research colonies if they gain entry inadvertently. Naturally infected carrier mice can have persistently high concentrations of virus in many organs, thereby facilitating virus excretion in saliva, nasal secretions, and urine. Persistently infected neonates usually reach breeding age and can perpetuate infection in a breeding colony. Thus introduction of a single LCMV carrier mouse to a breeding colony can eventually result in a high prevalence of persistently infected mice. Infection in adult mice, in contrast, is often acute because of the onset of effective immunity, and the spread of virus is halted. Horizontal spread of infection is enhanced by close contact, but rapid horizontal spread is not characteristic. Mice can transmit LCMV to hamsters, which can remain viremic and viruric for many months, even if they contract infection as adults. Infected hamsters can transmit virus to other hamsters and mice and are the primary source of human LCMV infection. Persistent infection in immunodeficient mice may carry greater risks for viral excretion and zoonotic transmission.",

However, lesions comparable to experimentally induced disease are rare during natural infection. Intracerebral inoculation of virus into immunocompetent adult mice induces nonsuppurative leptomeningitis, choroiditis, and focal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. Host tissues are damaged during the course of the cellular immune response to the virus. The character of visceral lesions depends on virus strain and mouse strain; the ratio of cytolytic to proliferative responses in lymphoid organs is mouse strain-dependent. In severe infection, nonsuppurative inflammation can occur in many tissues. The severity of accompanying cytolytic lesions seems to parallel the intensity of cellular immunity. Liver lesions can include hepatocyte necrosis accompanied by nodular infiltrates of lymphoid cells and Kupffer cells, activated sinusoidal endothelium, an occasional granulocyte or megakaryocyte, and fatty metamorphosis. Cytolysis, cell proliferation, and fibrinoid necrosis can develop in lymphoid organs. Necrosis of cortical thymocytes can lead to thymic involution. Lesions of late-onset disease are characterized by formation of immune complexes and associated inflammation. Renal glomeruli and the choroid plexus are most severely affected, but complexes may also be trapped in synovial membranes, blood vessel walls, and skin. Lymphoid nodules can form in various organs.

Thus, elimination of virus and virus-associated immunological injury are both T-cell-mediated. This apparent paradox has been explained by the view that prompt cellular immunity limits viral replication and leads to host survival, whereas slower cellular immune responses permit viral spread and increase the number of virus-infected target cells subject to attack once immunity is fully developed. Antibody can be detected by 1 week after infection but does not play a significant role in eliciting acute disease.

Immunohistochemistry can be used to detect viral antigen in brains of suckling and adult mice.

Natural vertical transmission has not been demonstrated. Introduction of MHV through injection of contaminated biologicals can be an important factor in epizootics, especially because some isolates infect B lymphocytes and, by implication, hybridomas nonlytically. Infection in immunocompetent mice is self-limiting. Immune-mediated clearance of virus associated with seroconversion usually begins about a week after infection, and mice recover fully within 3-4 weeks. Humoral and cellular immunity participate in host defenses to infection, and T-cell-dependent immunity is an absolute requirement. Thus, age-related resistance to MHV correlates with maturation of lymphoreticular tissues, but intestinal proliferative kinetics are critical determinants of disease susceptibility with enterotropic MHV. Enzootic infection had been construed to include persistent infection in individual mice. Current evidence suggests, however, that enzootic infection results either from the fresh and continuous introduction of immunologically naive or deficient mice or from the recurrent infection of immune mice with MHV variants that arise by natural mutation. Mutation is favored by immune pressure in enzootically infected colonies as well as missteps during natural replication, which include copying errors and recombination. Thus, mice that have developed immunity to one strain of MHV can remain susceptible to one or more genetically and antigenically divergent strains, resulting in reinfection. This caveat has practical importance for breeding colonies. Maternal immunity protects suckling mice against homologous MHV strains but not against antigenically variant strains. However, maternal immunity, even to homologous strains, depends on the presence of maternally acquired antibody in the lumen of the intestine. Therefore, the susceptibility of young mice to infection increases significantly at weaning.",

However, genetic resistance is also virus strain-dependent. Therefore, mice resistant to one strain of MHV may be susceptible to another strain. It also is worth noting that the expanded use of genetically altered mice with novel or unanticipated deficits in antiviral responses may alter the outcome of virus-host interactions unpredictably.

Viremic dissemination can follow if virus gains access to regional blood vessels and lymphatics. Thus, viremia leads to secondary infection of vascular endothelium and parenchymal tissues in multiple organs including liver, brain, lymphoid organs, and other sites. Mice also may develop central nervous system disease by direct extension of infection from the olfactory mucosa along olfactory tracts. At necropsy, yellow-white foci indicative of necrosis can occur in multiple tissues, with the involvement of the liver as the classical lesion. Liver involvement may be accompanied by icterus and peritonitis. Histologically, necrosis can be focal or confluent and may be infiltrated by inflammatory cells (Fig. 3.28) . Syncytia commonly form at the margin of necrotic areas and, in mild infections, may develop in the absence of frank necrosis. Syncytia formation is a hallmark of infection in many tissues, including the intestine (Fig. 3.26) , lung, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, brain, and bone marrow and in vascular endothelium in general. Although syncytia are transient in immunocompetent mice, they are a persistent feature in chronically infected, immunodeficient mice ( Fig. 3.29) . Neurotropic variants cause acute necrotizing encephalitis or meningoencephalitis in suckling mice, with demyelination in the brain stem and in peri-ependymal areas secondary to viral invasion of oligodendroglia. Convalescent mice may have residual mononuclear cell infiltrates around vessels or as focal lesions in the liver. Immunodeficient mice can develop progressive necrotic lesions in the liver and elsewhere. Compensatory splenomegaly may occur because of expansion of hematopoietic tissue.",

Pathogenic strains can cause lesions ranging from villus attenuation to fulminant necrotizing enterotyphlocolitis, which can kill suckling mice within a few days (Fig. 3.27) . The stomach is often empty, and the intestine is filled with watery to mucoid yellowish, sometimes gaseous contents.

Enterocytes may contain intracytoplasmic inclusions, but they are not diagnostic. Surviving mice develop compensatory mucosal hyperplasia, which eventually recedes, but may contribute to clinical signs due to osmotic, secretory, and malabsorptive diarrhea. Older mice are equally susceptible to infection, but are resistant to severe disease due to their mature (more rapid) intestinal proliferative kinetics. Pathology may be subtle, consisting of transient syncytia without necrotic lesions. In adult mice, syncytia can be found most often in the surface mucosal epithelium of the ascending colon. The exception occurs in immunodeficient mice, such as athymic and SCID mice, which can develop chronic proliferative bowel disease of varying severity with MHV antigen in mucosal epithelium (Figs. 3.31 and 3.32).

RT-PCR protocols to detect virus in tissues or excreta are available. The detection of syncytia augmented, when possible, by immunohistochemistry to LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE detect MHV antigen is a useful and practical means to confirm infection. This strategy should attempt to select mice that are in early stages of infection, because necrosis in infant mice or seroconversion in older mice may reduce the chances of detecting syncytia or viral antigens. The option of using immunodeficient mice as sentinels can be considered, because they sustain prolonged infection. However, they should be securely confined because they also amplify virus loads.

Perhaps the most important factor is the duration of infection in individual mice and in mouse colonies. There is evidence that infection in an individual immunocompetent mouse is acute and self-limiting. Such mice can be expected to develop immunity and eliminate virus within 30 days. Therefore, selective quarantine at the cage (not room) level with the temporary cessation of breeding can be used effectively to eliminate infection. Quarantine at the room basis is likely to fail, since mutations arise and continually reinfect the mouse population. Additionally, maternally derived immunity can protect infant mice from infection until they are weaned and moved to uncontaminated quarters. Careful testing with sentinel mice should be used to assess the effectiveness of quarantine or 'natural rederivation,' as just described. Immunodeficient mice, in contrast, are susceptible to chronic infection and viral excretion. Mice with unrecognized or unanticipated immune dysfunction or with selective immune dysfunction may impact on MHV infection and its control. Such colonies, which may contain highly valuable or irreplaceable mice, may be rescued by cesarean rederivation or embryo transfer if vertical transmission of MHV infection is subsequently ruled out. Although rodent coronaviruses are not viable for extended periods in the environment, excreted virus may remain infectious for up to several days, so proper sanitation and disinfection of caging and animal quarters as well as stringent personal sanitation are essential to eliminate infection.",

They are notoriously resistant to environmental inactivation, and cause significant gastrointestinal morbidity in humans. Noroviruses are species-specific, including MNV, which exclusively infects mice. Until the discovery of MNV, replication of noroviruses in vitro has not been possible. For this reason, MNV has emerged as an important small animal model of norovirus pathogenesis. MNV was relatively recently discovered in 2003, and subsequent surveillance has revealed that it is the most common adventitious virus infection in laboratory mice (Hsu et al., 2005; Pritchett-Corning et al., 2009) . Over 35 MNV isolates have been found in mouse research colonies around the world, which display nearly 90% genetic identity, comprising a single genetic cluster. Although genetically homogeneous, significant biological differences exist among MNV strains (Thackray et al., 2007) . MNV effectively replicates in macrophages and dendritic cells, including the mouse macrophage-like RAW264.7 cell line, as well as a microglial cell line (Wobus et al., 2004) .",

Each hantavirus is antigenically distinct and maintained within single or at most a few rodent or insectivore hosts, but are infectious for other hosts. Infection is lifelong, and virus is transmitted by shedding of virus in urine, feces, and saliva. Several hantaviruses are zoonotic and may cause severe disease in humans. Although there is overlap, hantaviruses in Asia and Europe cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans, a multisystem disease with significant renal involvement, and hantaviruses that are endemic in the Americas cause LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans, which is a multisystem disease with pulmonary involvement. Among the better-known Old World HFRS hantaviruses are Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, and Dobrava-Belgrade viruses. Sin Nombre virus is the best known New World PHS hantavirus, among many others. Most notably from the perspective of laboratory animal medicine, the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, serves as a reservoir host for hantavirus in the wild, but infection has also been associated with laboratory rats. In addition to being endemic in wild rats in Asia, it has been found to be endemic in wild rats in the eastern United States and associated with human cases of HFRS (Childs et al., 1988; LeDuc et al., 1984; Tsai et al., 1985) . Over 120 cases of hantavirus infection have been transmitted to humans from laboratory rats in Japan, Belgium, and the United Kingdom (Desmyter et al., 1983; Kawamata et al., 1987; Lloyd et al., 1984; Umenai et al., 1979) . M. musculus is not considered to be a primary reservoir host, but hantavirus infection has been documented serologically in conventional and barrier-maintained laboratory mice and rats in Korea (Won et al., 2006) , infection of wild M. musculus has been documented in the United States (Baek et al., 1988) , and infection of wild mice in Europe has been associated with human exposure (Diglisic et al., 1994) . Hantaviruses are difficult to culture in vitro. Infection in rodents is subclinical and is detected by serology or RT-PCR. The main research complication from natural infection is the zoonotic risk and potentially subclinical effects on the immune response associated with viral defenses such as CD8 + T cell (Taruishi et al., 2007) and NK function as demonstrated in human studies (Braun et al., 2014) .",

These viruses belong to a diverse assemblage of related mobile DNA elements that are integrated into the host genome, and collectively termed 'retroelements', which include retrovirus-related elements and nonviral elements. During cell division, retroelements are transcribed into RNA, and subsequently reverse-transcribed into DNA copies that become integrated into a new location within the genome. This process utilizes reverse transcriptase, which is encoded by the retroelement. Over millennia, retroelements have been repeatedly integrated within the genome in large numbers, comprising approximately 40% of the mammalian genome. Various families of mouse retroelements share sequence similarity, despite their random distribution throughout the mouse genome, and the majority of them are truncated, mutated, and methylated to become incapable of infectivity. Nevertheless, many of them continue to be mobile within the genome. Noninfectious retrovirus-related retroelements include IAP, VL30, MusD, and ETn elements.",

Exogenous MMTV and MLV exist in wild mouse populations, but have been eliminated from contemporary laboratory mice. However, they may continue to be used experimentally, including Bittner MMTV, and Gross, Friend, Moloney, and Rauscher MLVs.

Likewise, all mouse strains carry endogenous MLV loci within their genome, but not all mice carry replication-competent MLV sequences. Some endogenous MLVs encode infectious virus, which can be visualized as C-type particles by electron microscopy. Mice have often evolved mechanisms to counter the deleterious effects of retroviruses by preventing reentry or replication of virus into other cells. If an endogenous retrovirus is still infectious to other mouse cell targets, it is termed ecotropic, whereas if it is no longer infectious for mouse cells, but can infect cells of other species, it is termed xenotropic.

Otitis media may cause a head tilt, whereas suppurative inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, although rare, can cause flaccid paralysis. Experimental infection of the genital tract can cause oophoritis, salpingitis, and metritis, which may lead to infertility or fetal deaths.

M. pulmonis infection is contracted by inhalation and can occur in suckling and adult mice. Therefore, infection should be considered highly contagious. Mice injected with cells harvested from M. pulmonis contaminated cell cultures may develop disease. M. pulmonis can also be transmitted venerally; in utero infection has been demonstrated in rats but not in mice. Because transplacental infection occurs in rats, the same route may be possible in mice, particularly immunocompromised strains. Concomitant viral pneumonia (SV, mouse coronavirus) or elevated environmental ammonia concentrations may increase susceptibility to MRM. M. pulmonis also infects rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, and rabbits. Among these species, only rats are significant reservoirs of infection for mice.",

Buffered saline or Mycoplasma broth should be used to lavage the trachea, larynx, pharynx, and nasal passages. Specimens for culture from the genital tract are warranted if this site is suspected. Mycoplasma spp. may be difficult to grow, so it is prudent to confirm that the relevant expertise and quality control exist in the diagnostic laboratory. Speciation can be accomplished by immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining or by growth inhibition. Immunohistochemistry should be considered to supplement basic histopathologic examination. Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques are available to identify mycoplasma antigens in tissue sections or in cytological preparations of tracheobronchial or genital tract lavages (Brunnert et al., 1994) .

Therefore, CAR bacillus may exacerbate respiratory disease as an opportunist rather than as a primary pathogen. On balance, it is assumed that mice contract natural infection, but attributing severe chronic respiratory disease in mice solely to CAR bacillus should be supported by screening for other respiratory pathogens.",

C. rodentium shares several pathogenic mechanisms, such as attaching and effacing lesions mediated by the intimin receptor, with select Escherichia coli (reviewed in Collins et al. (2014) ). C. rodentium is used experimentally to model colitis caused by enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) in humans (Mallick et al., 2012; Collins et al., 2014) . Host genotype can influence the course and severity of disease (Barthold et al., 1977) . For example, DBA, NIH Swiss, and C57BL mice are relatively resistant to mortality, whereas C3H/HeJ mice are relatively susceptible both as sucklings and as adults. Interestingly, C57BL mice obtained from different commercial sources have varying susceptibility to C. rodentium (ostensibly due to the presence or absence of segmented filamentous bacteria). Diet also can modulate infection, but specific dietary factors responsible for this effect have not been identified.",

It is characterized by angiocentric nonsuppurative hepatitis and hepatic necrosis (Fig. 3.43) . Inflammation originates in portal triads and spreads to adjacent hepatic parenchyma. Hepatic necrosis also may occur adjacent to intralobular venules, which can contain microthrombi. Additionally, phlebitis may affect central veins. This lesion has been linked to the presence of organisms in bile canaliculi by silver stains and electron microscopy. Age-related hepatocytic proliferation can develop in infected livers, a response that is more pronounced in male mice than in female mice (Fox et al., 1996a) . This lesion may LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE increase susceptibility to hepatomas and hepatocellular carcinomas among aged male A/JCr and B6C3F1 mice from infected colonies. An increased incidence of hepatic hemangiosarcoma also has been noted in H. hepaticusinfected male B6C3F1 mice. In this context, A/JCr, C3H/ HeNCr, and SJL/NCr mice are susceptible to hepatitis, whereas C57BL/6 mice are resistant (Ward et al., 1994) . The finding of severe liver disease and tumor induction in B6C3F1 mice infected with H. hepaticus infers that genetic susceptibility to H. hepaticus-induced neoplasia has a dominant pattern of inheritance.

However, genus-specific PCR does not differentiate among different Helicobacter spp. Molecular speciation can be accomplished by 16S rRNA sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the PCR product or use of species-specific PCR assays. This procedure requires suitable skill and experience to avoid technological pitfalls and should be performed by qualified laboratories. An IgG ELISA using the outer membrane protein as the antigen has been proposed for serological diagnosis, but shared antigens among EHS create lack of specificity for the assay. As noted above, helicobacters can be isolated on antibiotic-impregnated blood agar under microaerobic conditions and can then be speciated biochemically, and by Helicobacter species-specific PCR. Isolation of H. hepaticus and from other Helicobacter spp. with spiral to curved morphology from feces should be preceded by passing slurried samples through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter before plating. If infection with larger fusiform helicobacters (H. bilis, H. rappini) is suspected, filtration at 0.65 \u03bcm is preferred. Helicobacters grow slowly and require prolonged incubation of cultures (up to 3 weeks) before they can be deemed negative. Signs (rectal prolapse) and lesions (hepatitis, typhlocolitis), depending on host genotype, can be suggestive of infection. Histopathological examination should include silver stains, especially of liver, to attempt to visualize spiral or curved organisms (Whary and Fox, 2004) .",

The best results have been obtained by triple therapy with amoxicillin, metronidazole, and bismuth given for 2 weeks (Del Carmen Martino-Cardona et al., 2010) . This strategy requires repeated daily gavage rather than administration in drinking water, but it has successfully eliminated H. hepaticus from naturally infected mice. Antibiotic impregnated wafers have been used to eradicate Helicobacter spp. in mouse colonies (Kerton and Warden, 2006) . Wide-scale, eradication of enzootic helicobacteriosis can be expensive and time-consuming, without guarantee of success. Careful husbandry procedures can limit infection within a colony (Whary et al., 2000) . Therefore, strategies have to be weighed carefully against risks of enzootic infection for the health and use of mice. In contrast, infection should be avoided in immunodeficient mice, including genetically engineered mice with targeted or serendipitous immune dysfunction. Lastly, the outcome of opportunistic helicobacteriosis has not been thoroughly examined. This condition could occur during simultaneous infection with two or more Helicobacter species or during combined infection with an intestinal virus (e.g., coronavirus) and Helicobacter spp. If highly valuable animals are exposed, antibiotic therapy or rederivation may be warranted.",

Eczematous dermatitis develops primarily on the face, ears, neck, shoulders, and forelegs and can progress to ulcerative dermatitis, abscessation (including botryomycotic granulomas), and cellulitis. Because lesions are often pruritic, scratching causes additional trauma and autoinoculation. Staphylococcal infection in the genital mucosa of males may produce preputial gland abscesses.

Immunodeficient mice (e.g., athymic mice) contaminated with staphylococci often develop abscesses or furunculosis (Fig. 3.45 ). As noted above, behavioral dysfunction resulting in selfmutilation, including scratching and trichotillomania, is a likely predisposing factor.

A model of AAHC has been developed in rats by administering amoxicillinclavulanate followed by orally infecting rats with a strain of K. oxytoca cultured from a patient with AAHC. Studies in humans suggest that K. oxytoca exerts its pathogenicity in part through a cytotoxin. Recently, authors have showed that several animal isolates of K. oxytoca, including clinical isolates, produced secreted products in bacterial culture supernatant that display cytotoxicity on HEp-2 and HeLa cells, indicating the ability to produce cytotoxin. Using mass spectroscopy techniques, they also confirmed tilivalline as the cytotoxin present in animal K. oxytoca strains. Tilivalline may serve as a biomarker for K. oxytoca-induced cytotoxicity (Darby et al., 2014) .",

In the early 2000s, an increased interest in C. difficile infection (CDI) resulted from the emergence of a hyper-virulent strain (NAP1/BI/027) associated with frequent recurrences and more severe clinical disease (Abou Chakra et al., 2014; McFarland, 2009; Kuijper et al., 2006) . C. difficile has also been implicated in antibioticassociated colitis in Syrian hamsters (Bartlett et al., 1977) , guinea pigs (Lowe et al., 1980) , rabbits (Thilsted et al., 1981; Ryden et al., 1991) , prairie dogs (Muller et al., 1987) , ostriches (Frazier et al., 1993) , and horses (Diab et al., 2013) . C. difficile is a rod-shaped strict anaerobe. Cycloserinecefoxitin-fructose agar (CCFA) is a commonly used selective medium for C. difficile. Cultures are incubated under anaerobic conditions at 35-37\u00b0C. When grown on blood agar, C. difficile colonies are nonhemolytic and gray, and have a slightly raised umbonate profile with filamentous edges and a ground-glass appearance. Colonies grown on blood agar have fluorescence under ultraviolet light. C. difficile forms acid from glucose and fructose, but is negative on lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Two closely related exotoxins, Toxin A and Toxin B, are produced by C. difficile. Recent taxonomic classification support placement of C. difficile and its close relatives within the family Peptostreptococcaceae. The authors suggested renaming it Peptoclostridium difficile (Yutin and Galperin, 2013) .",

Susceptibility of mice to infection must be induced by disrupting the microbiota through antibiotic treatment. Brief exposure to environmental LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE spore contamination is sufficient for transmission of C. difficile to na\u00efve but susceptible mice. The CDI transmission model has been used to demonstrate that clindamycin treatment of asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile can inadvertently trigger the excretion of high levels of spores (Lawley et al., 2009) . A C57BL mouse model of recurrence/relapse CDI has been reported (Sun et al., 2011) . The primary bout of CDI induced little or no protective antibody response against C. difficile toxins and mice continued shedding C. difficile spores. Antibiotic treatment of surviving mice induced a second episode of diarrhea. A simultaneous reexposure of mice to C. difficile bacteria or spores elicited a full clinical spectrum of CDI similar to that of the primary infection. Immunosuppressive agents resulted in more severe and fulminant recurrent disease. Vancomycin treatment only delayed disease recurrence; however, neutralizing polysera against both TcdA and TcdB completely protected mice against CDI relapse (Sun et al., 2011) . A recent study in C57BL mice demonstrated that antibiotic-mediated alteration of the gut microbiome favors a global metabolic profile, and therefore increases susceptibility to C. difficile clinical diseases (Theriot et al., 2014) .",

Stresses, such as overcrowding, high temperature and humidity, moist food, and immunosuppression, and young age, may predispose mice to Tyzzer's disease. Susceptibility and resistance also are influenced by host genotype. It has been shown, e.g., that C57BL/6 mice are more resistant than DBA/2 mice to Tyzzer's disease (Waggie et al., 1981) . Resistance to severe infection appears to be due, in part, to B-lymphocyte function. The role of T cells in resistance is not clear, because susceptibility among athymic mice appears to vary (Livingston et al., 1996) . However, the involvement of T cells can be inferred by the fact that several interleukins modulate resistance and susceptibility.

Therefore, the risks for cross-infection depend on the strain causing a given outbreak. Although the vegetative form of C. piliforme is unstable, spores can retain infectivity at room temperature for at least 1 year and should be viewed as the primary means of spread. Natural infection is probably due to ingestion of organisms, which are subsequently shed in feces. Feces-contaminated food and soiled bedding are the most likely sources of environmental contamination. Prenatal infection can be induced by intravenous inoculation of pregnant mice, but its importance in the natural transmission of infection has not been determined.",

A national survey revealed that more than 30% of barrier colonies and about 70% of conventional colonies were affected (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1997; Carty, 2008) . Syphacia obvelata infestation can occur unexpectedly in commercial barrier murine colonies, resulting in widespread dissemination of the parasite into academic mouse colonies. The epizootiological impact of pinworm infestation is increased by the airborne dissemination of eggs, which can remain infectious even after drying. The life-cycle is direct and completed in 11-15 days. Females deposit their eggs on the skin and hairs of the perianal region. Ingested eggs liberate larvae in the small intestine and they migrate to the cecum within 24 h. Worms remain in the cecum for 10-11 days, where they mature and mate. The females then migrate to the large intestine to deposit their eggs as they leave the host. There is unconfirmed speculation that larvae may reenter the rectum. Infestation usually begins in young mice and can recur, but adult mice tend to be more resistant. Syphacia infestation often occurs in combination with Aspiculuris tetraptera. Because the life cycle of Syphacia is much shorter than that of Aspiculuris, the number of mice that are apt to be infected with S. obvelata is correspondingly greater. There is evidence that resistance to infestation may be mouse strain-specific (Derothe et al., 1997) .",

Because some of the recommended therapies have the potential for toxicity, it is prudent to keep mice under close clinical observation during treatment (Davis et al., 1999; Skopets et al., 1996; Toth et al., 2000) . Fenbendazole diets can be fed with 1 week on/1 week off rotation with normal chow although the potential impact on experimental data must be considered (Duan et al., 2012; Gadad et al., 2010; Landin et al., 2009) . Prevention of reinfestation requires strict isolation because Syphacia eggs become infective as soon as 6 h after they are laid, and they survive for weeks, even in dry conditions. Strict sanitation, sterilization of feed and bedding, and periodic anthelmintic treatment are required to control infestation. The use of microbarrier cages can reduce the spread of infective eggs. Syphacia muris is the common rat pinworm. It can potentially infest mice but is not found in well-managed colonies. It can be differentiated from S. obvelata because S. muris eggs are smaller. Treatment is the same as for pinworms of mice.",

Populations are limited by factors such as self-grooming, mutual grooming, the presence of hair, and immunological responses, which tend to produce hypersensitivity dermatitis. Inherited resistance and susceptibility also affect clinical expression of acariasis. Mite populations, e.g., vary widely among different stocks and strains of mice housed under similar conditions. Pathology Gross lesions include scaly skin, regional hair loss, abrasions, and ulcerations. Histologically, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and chronic dermatitis may occur. Long-standing infestation provokes chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and proliferation of granulation tissue.

Hairs are parted with pins or sticks and examined with a dissecting microscope. Examination of young mice, prior to the onset of immune-mediated equilibrium, is likely to be more productive. Alternatively, recently euthanized mice can be placed on a black paper, and double-sided cellophane tape can be used to line the perimeter to contain the parasites. As the carcass cools, parasites will vacate the pelage and crawl onto the paper. Sealed Petri dishes can also be used. Cellophane tape also can be pressed against areas of the pelt of freshly euthanatized mice and examined microscopically. Skin scrapings made with a scalpel blade can be macerated in 10% KOH/glycerin or immersion oil and examined microscopically. This method has the disadvantage of missing highly motile species and low-level populations of slower moving immature forms.

Mite populations increase during new infestations, followed by a decrease to equilibrium in 8-10 weeks. The equilibrated population can be carried in colonies for long periods (up to years). Population fluctuations may represent waves of egg hatchings. Because mites are thermotactic, they crawl to the end of hair shafts on dead hosts, where they may live for up to 4 days. Infestation may result in hypersensitivity dermatitis, to which C57BL mice are highly susceptible. Clinical signs vary from ruffled fur and alopecia to pruritic ulcerative dermatitis. Therefore, lesions can be exacerbated by self-inflicted trauma.",

Its life cycle is unknown, but developmental stages from egg to adult may be found in a single dermal nodule. Transmission is by direct contact. Invasion of hair follicles leads to development of cyst-like nodules, which appear as small white nodules in the subcutis. Histologically, they are invaginated sacs of squamous epithelium, excretory products, and keratinaceous debris. There is usually no inflammatory reaction, but healing may be accompanied by granulomatous inflammation. Diagnosis is made by examining the subcuticular surface of the pelt grossly or by histological examination. Sac contents also can be expressed by pressure with a scalpel blade or scraped and mounted for microscopic exam.",

Secondary amyloidosis is usually associated with chronic inflammatory lesions, including dermatitis resulting from prolonged acariasis. It can be induced experimentally, however, by injection of casein and may occur locally in association with neoplasia or in ovarian corpora lutea in the absence of other disease. In reactive amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, serum AA (SAA) protein forms deposits in mice, domestic and wild animals, and humans that experience chronic inflammation. AA amyloid fibrils are abnormal \u03b2-sheet-rich forms of the serum precursor SAA, with conformational changes that promote fibril formation. Similar to prion diseases, recent findings suggest that AA amyloidosis could be transmissible in mice and other species (Murakami et al., 2014) . Amyloid fibrils induce a seeding-nucleation process that may lead to development of AA amyloidosis.

Unfortunately, much of the information that does exist reflects work carried out 30-50 years ago; thus, the reliability and specificity of some of these syndromes is questionable. Vitamin A deficiency may produce tremors, diarrhea, rough hair coat, keratitis, poor growth, abscesses, hemorrhages, and sterility or abortion. Vitamin A is recognized for its importance in development of the immune system (Ross, 2012) and knockout mouse models have been used to demonstrate genetic polymorphisms in humans that negatively regulate intestinal \u03b2-carotene absorption and conversion to retinoids in response to vitamin A requirements for growth and reproduction (von Lintig, 2012) . Vitamin E deficiency can cause convulsions and heart failure, as well as muscular dystrophy and hyaline degeneration of muscles. Two knockout mouse models of severe vitamin E deficiency were independently developed and lack \u03b1-tocopherol transfer protein (\u03b1-TTP), a gene that controls plasma and tissue \u03b1-tocopherol concentrations by exporting \u03b1-tocopherol from the liver. Ttpa \u2212/\u2212 mice have very low to undetectable levels of \u03b1-tocopherol and are infertile. The phenotype includes neuronal degeneration associated with progressive ataxia and age-related behavioral defects (Yu and Schellhorn, 2013) . Deficiency of B complex vitamins produces nonspecific signs such as alopecia, decreased feed consumption, poor growth, poor reproduction and lactation, as well as a variety of neurological abnormalities. Choline deficiency produces fatty livers and nodular hepatic hyperplasia, as well as myocardial lesions, decreased conception, and decreased viability of litters. Folic acid-deficient diets cause marked decreases in red and white cell blood counts and the disappearance of megakaryocytes and nucleated cells from the spleen. Pantothenic acid deficiency is characterized by nonspecific signs, such as weight loss, alopecia, achromotrichia, and posterior paralysis, as well as other neurological abnormalities. Thiamin deficiency is associated with neurological signs, such as violent convulsions, cartwheel movements, and decreased food consumption. Dietary requirements for ascorbic acid have not been shown in mice, and mouse diets are generally not fortified with ascorbic acid. The gulonolactone oxidase knockout mouse (Gulo \u2212/\u2212 ) on the C57BL/6 background requires vitamin C supplementation although the plasma ascorbate concentration of Gulo \u2212/\u2212 mice fed a vitamin C-deficient diet is maintained at 15% of wild-type concentrations, suggesting an uncharacterized pathway to generate a small amount of ascorbate (Yu and Schellhorn, 2013) . The Gulo \u2212/\u2212 mouse has become the model of choice in studying the role of vitamin C in complex diseases. Vitamin C production has been successfully restored in Gulo \u2212/\u2212 mice using adenovirus vectors, making it possible to robustly manipulate physiological ascorbate concentrations in an inbred mouse.",

(Sundberg, 1994; Ward, 2000) The significant syndrome of ulcerative dermatitis (UD) is a common idiopathic skin lesion that causes morbidity and early euthanasia losses in C57BL/6 and related lines of mice. Significant pruritus leads to skin trauma associated with opportunistic bacterial infection and deep dermal ulcerations. Initial signs include alopecia and papular dermatitis, which usually occur over the dorsal trunk (Fig. 3.59) . Progressive inflammation can be halted, sometimes reversed, by nail trimming and therapy with a wide spectrum of topical or systemic antibiotics, steroids, and other drugs such as Vitamin E and aloe, all of which speak to the frustrating search for a primary etiology. Treatment should be based on microbiological culture and sensitivity and screening for ectoparasites as hypersensitivity to acariasis has been proposed. Seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of disease suggests that environmental factors may play a role. The incidence appears to increase during periods of significant seasonal changes in temperature and humidity, i.e., the onset of winter and early spring. There is some evidence that incidence is related to dietary fat with mice on high fat or ad libitum diets being more susceptible than those on restricted diets (Neuhaus et al., 2012) .",

Lactating mice are either found dead or becoming moribund. Segments of the small intestine become distended with fluid contents and histologically there is apoptosis of the villus epithelium of the small intestine and superficial epithelial cells of the large intestine. The enteric nervous system appears morphologically normal but necrotic enterocytes, mucosal erosions, and acute mucosal inflammation are commonly observed. There is no strong evidence for metabolic issues such as hypocalcemia or low blood glucose. The direct cause is unknown but death probably results from sepsis secondary to loss of barrier function reflected in apoptosis of the gut epithelium during peak lactation.",

Often one mouse in the cage is free of lesions and is the likely aggressor. Removal of the unaffected male may end the fighting or simply reorder the dominance order. Removing males for breeding and then regrouping them often results in fighting. For programs that produce sentinel mice in-house, castration is an option to reduce aggression in group-housed male sentinels (Lofgren et al., 2012) . Regional alopecia, especially around the muzzle, may result from abrasion against cage surfaces. Improperly diluted disinfectants may also cause regional hair loss. Ear tags used for identification may cause pruritis and self-induced trauma. Hair removal products or clipping prior to imaging or application of experimental compounds to the skin may cause pruritus and can augment lesions that interfere with test results. Dermatophytosis, ectoparasitism, or idiopathic hair loss must be considered in the differential diagnoses for muzzle or body alopecia. (Burek et al., 1982; Percy and Barthold, 2007) Common idiopathic lesions in aging mice include cardiomyopathy (with or without mineralization or arteritis), chronic nephropathy (frequently with mineralization), myelofibrosis (fibrotic change in the bone marrow) especially in female mice, melanosis in the meninges, ovarian atrophy (with or without hyaline material), pigment (ceroid-lipofuscin), tubular or stromal hyperplasia, cystic endometrial hyperplasia, testicular tubular degeneration or mineralization, prostate atypical epithelial hyperplasia, gastric glandular epithelial hyperplasia, pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia, dental dysplasia of incisor teeth, pituitary hyperplasia of pars intermedia and pars distalis, cataracts, increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen, and lymphocytic infiltrates or other inflammatory changes in various tissues, including Harderian gland, salivary gland, kidney, liver, gall bladder, nasal, trachea, thyroid, periovarian fat, epididymis, and urinary bladder.

NZB and NZB \u00d7 NZW F 1 hybrid mice, e.g., develop immune complex glomerulonephritis as an autoimmune disease resembling human lupus erythematosus, whereas glomerular disease is relatively mild in NZB mice (NZB mice have a high incidence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia). Renal changes occur as early as 4 months of age, but clinical signs and severe disease are not present until 6-9 months. The disease is associated with wasting and proteinuria, and lesions progress until death intervenes. Histologically, glomeruli have proteinaceous deposits in the capillaries and mesangium. Later, tubular atrophy and proteinaceous casts occur throughout the kidney. Immunofluorescence studies show deposits of immunoglobulin and the third component of complement, which lodge as immune complexes with nuclear antigens and antigens of murine leukemia virus in glomerular capillary loops. Mice infected with LCMV or with retroviruses can also develop immune complex glomerulonephritis.",

There are, however, some strains of mice that have been specifically inbred and selected for susceptibility to spontaneous tumors. Leukemogenesis in mice may involve viruses and chemical or physical agents. Viruses associated with lymphopoietic and hematopoietic neoplasia belong to the family Retroviridae (type C oncornaviruses) and contain RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). These viruses are generally noncytopathogenic for infected cells, and mice appear to harbor them as normal components of their genome. Although they may be involved in spontaneous leukemia, they are not consistently expressed in this disease. Recombinant viruses have recently been discovered that can infect mouse cells and heterologous cells and are associated with spontaneous leukemia development in high leukemia strains such as AKR mice. Their phenotypic expression is controlled by mouse genotype. Endogenous retroviruses are transmitted vertically through the germ line. Horizontal transmission is inefficient but can occur by intrauterine infection or through saliva, sputum, urine, feces, or milk. The leukemia induced by a given endogenous virus is usually of a single histopathological type. Loss of function in nucleic acid-recognizing, TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 can result in spontaneous retroviral viremia and acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (Yu et al., 2012) .

Histologically, mammary tumors have been categorized into three major groups: carcinomas, carcinomas with squamous cell differentiation, and carcinosarcomas. The carcinomas are divided into adenocarcinoma types A, B, C, Y, L, and P. Most tumors are type A or B. Type A consists of adenomas, tubular carcinomas, and alveolar carcinomas. Type B tumors have a variable pattern with both well-differentiated and poorly differentiated regions. They may consist of regular cords or sheets of cells or papillomatous areas. These two types are locally invasive and may metastasize to the lungs. Type C tumors are rare and are characterized by multiple cysts lined by low cuboidal to squamous epithelial cells, and they have abundant stroma. Type Y tumors, which are also rare, are characterized by tubular branching of cuboidal epithelium and abundant stroma. Adenocarcinomas with a lacelike morphology (types L and P) are hormone dependent and have a branching tubular structure.",
