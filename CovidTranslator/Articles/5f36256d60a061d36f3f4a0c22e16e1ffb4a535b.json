However, the influence of parameter values on algorithm performance is often ignored. Methods: Based on reported case counts of bacillary dysentery from 2005 to 2007 in Beijing, semi-synthetic datasets containing outbreak signals were simulated to evaluate the performance of five outbreak detection algorithms. Parameters' values were optimized prior to the evaluation. Results: Differences in performances were observed as parameter values changed. Of the five algorithms, space-time permutation scan statistics had a specificity of 99.9% and a detection time of less than half a day. The exponential weighted moving average exhibited the shortest detection time of 0.1 day, while the modified C1, C2 and C3 exhibited a detection time of close to one day. Conclusion: The performance of these algorithms has a correlation to their parameter values, which may affect the performance evaluation.",

In January 2004, the National Disease Surveillance, Reporting and Management System were launched in China. The system which covers 37 infectious diseases has the potential to provide timely analysis and early detection of outbreaks. However, as the passive surveillance system relies on accumulated case and laboratory reports, which are often delayed and sometimes incomplete, the opportunity to contain the spread of the disease is often missed.",

Due to a lack of complete and real data pertaining from historical outbreaks, the perfor-mance of these systems have been previously difficult to evaluate [10] . Adding to these difficulties is the fact that the information obtained from historical outbreaks may be heterogeneous, due to changes in the outbreak surveillance criteria's over time. In order to compensate for missing or heterogeneous information, semisynthetic datasets can be created which contain the outbreak signals, using a software tool. By using this tool, the parameters of the outbreak including the desired duration, temporal pattern and the magnitude (based on a predefined criteria), can be specially set.",

In the protocol, a bacillary dysentery outbreak was defined as the occurrence of 10 or more bacillary dysentery cases in the same school, natural village or community within 1-3 days. Based on this definition, there was only one actual outbreak in the summer of 2007. During this outbreak, 10 children from a middle school were clinically diagnosed as having bacillary dysentery and four were culture positive for Shigella sonnei. The first case became ill on the evening of the 21st of July and was taken to hospital the next day. Two cases were reported on the 22nd of July, a further four on the 23rd of July, and two on the 24th July.

Among these combinations of different k and k values, k = 0.9, k = 1.0 showed the shortest detection time, with a specificity of 89.5%.

EWMA applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially. The choice of weighting factor k is the key for successful outbreak detection. With proper k value, EWMA control procedure can be adjusted to be sensitive to a small or gradual drift in the process. We feel that adjusting k value should be an imperative step before applying EWMA into practice. Space-time permutation scan statistics consider both the temporal and spatial factors. The scanning window is under dynamic change to avoid selection bias. However, space-time scan statistics do not consider population movements. In addition, space-time scan statistics can only identify clusters in simple regular shapes. If the cluster does not conform to a regular shape, the algorithm may have a poor performance. Therefore, when space-time permutation scan statistics are used to detect the outbreaks, it is imperative to understand the cluster shape. Only in the right shape, can space-time permutation scan statistics demonstrate a high detection efficacy. Aside from these limitations, the use of space-time permutation scan statistics allowed the early outbreak detection for bacillary dysentery.",

These differences in the time to detection calculations may explain the differences between the two studies. In our study, when the algorithms failed to detect the simulated outbreak, time to detection was set as the largest value (3 days). As we know, C1, C2 and C3 have increasing sensitivities. Obviously, as the sensitivity increased from C1 to C3, the number of missed outbreaks decreased and consequently the time to detection declined accordingly.

Considering the time to detection integrating effect of sensitivity, we simplified the three evaluation indices to two, time to detection and specificity. The former reflected both the timeliness and sensitivity, and the latter reflected the accuracy of outbreak detection. We made timeliness the priority over accuracy due to bacillary dysentery's short incubation period and the fact that it can be both food-borne and water-borne.

Consequently, the sensitivity of the five algorithms may be less when a bacillary dysentery outbreak occurs in a school, as the cases may be scattered in different sub-districts. It is therefore important to collect extra information on workplaces, schools and other units. Due to a lack of actual outbreaks, we injected simulated outbreaks into the baseline so we could undertake a performance assessment on these outbreak detection algorithms. We changed the size, magnitude, temporal progressive pattern, season and spatial distribution of bacillary dysentery, in order to have a variety of outbreak conditions to test. As these are approximations, it is difficult to evaluate how close our simulations came to the actual outbreak. Consequently, further research is needed in predicting the actual performance of these algorithms.",
