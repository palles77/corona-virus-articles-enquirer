Recombinants expressing single or double antigens of HIV-1 (rMV-HIV) were genetically highly stable on human diploid cells. The production process of these viruses was essentially similar to the parental MV strain, yielding comparative end titers. Immunization of tg-mice by different regimens and formulations showed potent humoral and cellular immune responses against MV and HIV antigens. Recombinant MV-HIV expressing Gag protein conferred protective immunity in tg-mice after a high-dose pseudochallenge with recombinant vaccinia virus. In addition, rMV-HIV boosted anti-HIV antibodies, in the presence of pre-existing anti-vector antibodies.",

            "text": "While correlates of protection against HIV infection and persistence are not yet defined, the quest for a prophylactic vaccine remains a major goal in the fight against AIDS. Ideally an HIV vaccine should induce both neutralizing antibodies, to block establishment of an infection, and cell-mediated immunity to contain an escaped virus infection [2, 3] . In addition, the vaccine should be safe and feasible to manufacture on a large scale. Novel technologies were employed collectively to develop a vaccine, among these are the replication deficient viral vectors, like modified vaccinia Ankara, canarypox and adenoviruses and the live attenuated viral vectors, like MV. In addition, non-viral DNA and protein formulations were also employed [4] . However, the failure of Merck's clinical study, using a recombinant Ad5 expressing HIV-1 gag-pol-nef, led the scientific community to critically address the safety of such technologies [5] . While most of the vector systems did not originate from an existing vaccine, MV vector is derived from the live attenuated Moraten \u00ae vaccine (MVbv) (Zuniga et al., in preparation) . MV vaccine has an excellent safety record as an injectable and as an aerosol vaccine [6, 7] . It strongly activates different arms of the immune system (cellular, humoral and mucosal) after a single or two low-dose injections [8, 9] . Persistence of antibodies and CTLs has been shown for as long as 25 years after vaccination [10] . Additionally, MV genome is not translocated into the nucleus which avoids viral genome integration into host cell genome, adding to the safety profile of the vaccine. A reverse genetics system for MV was established allowing the insertion and expression of additional transgenes by the viral genome [11] [12] [13] . In this paper, we show that rMVs expressing single and/or multiple HIV-1 genes remain stable and induce humoral and cellular immune responses against HIV-1 in transgenic mice, while retaining its efficacy against measles.",

These genes were optimized for human codon usage. For gp140dCFI (e1), the cytoplasmic tail, the transmembrane domain, the cleavage site and the fusion domain were deleted to yield a secreted gp140 form. Moreover, to obtain a fusion intermediate-like configuration, a region encoding the interheptad space was additionally deleted. For the gp140dV1/2dCFI (e2) an additional sequence deletion in the hyper-variable loops 1 and 2 (dV1/2) was performed to enhance the exposure of conserved epitopes and therefore increase the chances to induce neutralizing antibodies. The gagpol construct (gp) represents a synthetic gene encoding a Gag-Pol fusion protein optimized to induce potent cellular immune responses [15] . Critical functions of Pol-derived enzymes were inactivated by mutagenesis for safety reasons.

Mice were immunized with single rMV-HIV (rMVb2-HIV-e1, rMVb2-HIV-e2 rMVb2-HIV-gag and rMVb2-HIV-gp), with a mix of two different recombinants (rMVb2-HIV-e2 + rMVb2-HIV-gp) and with recombinants expressing double transgenes (rMVb23-HIVe1gp or rMVb23-HIV-e2gp). Standard MVb vaccine was used as a control. Blood was drawn at weeks 4, 8 and 12 and sera were assayed by ELISA for antibody responses against MV or HIV-1 clade B. The results show that all mouse groups (immunized with different rMV-HIVs) induced similar high-titers of anti-measles antibodies, and these were comparable to the antibody titers induced by standard MVb vaccine (Fig. 3A) . Interestingly, probing the same sera for anti-HIV antibodies, comparable high titers of anti-HIV env antibodies were found in different mouse groups (whether they were immunized with a single recombinant expressing e1 or e2 or from mouse group immunized with rMV-HIV expressing double antigens (e1 and gp), or from a group immunized with a mixture of two single recombinants (rMVb2-HIV-e1 + rMVb2-HIVgp) (Fig. 3A) . Four weeks after the prime, considerable titers of anti HIV antibodies were readily measured (Fig. 3A, right panel, red bars). Four weeks after the boost, a 100-fold increase in HIV antibody titers were measured in all mouse groups, except the MVbv immunized animals and the negative controls. These results indicate that rMV vector is immunogenic and, in the presence of anti-MV antibodies (previously induced after the prime, left panel, red bars), rMVs expressing HIV antigens boosted anti HIV antibodies (Fig. 3A, right panel, blue and green bars) . UV inactivated MVb2-HIV-e1 did not induce detectable antibodies against env, indicating that in vivo replication is central for the presentation of the env antigen and the induction of immune responses (Table 2) . Similarly, anti-vector response was found severely affected after UV inactivation. This indicates that virus replication is required for an efficient humoral immune response.",

Splenocytes were extracted 3 weeks after a single immunization with 1 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/animal using diverse virus preparations expressing gag or gagpol recombinant protein. Splenocytes were then re-stimulated either with medium (negative control) or MVAgag clade B. The MVA-gag re-stimulated splenocytes revealed significant T cell immune response activation. Mice immunized with single recombinant viruses which express the transgene from position 2 (MVb2-HIV-gag or MVb2-HIV-gp) induced the best responses. This result also shows that independently of the subgenomic site of gagpol transgene expression (position 2 or 3 within the MV genome; gp2 or gp3 respectively) similar cellular immune response could be induced. Moreover, the double recombinant viruses, MVb23-HIV-e1gp, or the mix of two recombinant viruses (MVb2-HIV-e1 + MVb2-HIV-gp) displayed comparable cellular immune response. Unexpectedly, the mix of MVb2-HIVe1 and MVb2-HIV-gp (e1 + gp) and the double recombinant (e1 \u2212 gp) gave a lower number of spot-forming cells (SFC) compared with the single recombinants, yet animals were immunized with the same amounts of viruses. It is likely that viruses in a heterogeneous mixture may give rise to unpredictable competition between the two viruses. Additionally, the delayed replication of the double recombinant may also explain the obtained lower values. The MVbv vaccinated mice, as expected, did not induce any gag-specific cellular immune response.",

IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 CD46 tg-mice are optimal because they are sensitive to recombinant vaccinia challenge, characterized by a weight loss upon infection with either rVac-gag or Vac/wt viruses. Groups of 4 (naive) or 6 (pre-immunized) mice were challenged with rVac-gag or Vac/wt on day 10 post-immunization with rMVb2-HIV-gag. Animal weight loss was monitored daily. The results shown in Fig. 3C indicate that the rMVb2-HIV-gag pre-immunized mice were less susceptible to weight loss than the na\u00efve mice indicating controlled replication of the challenge virus in one group but not the other. Animals pre-immunized with MVb2-HIV-gag but challenged with Vac/wt displayed a significant weight loss (10-15%) at 7 days post-challenge. Naive mice challenged with either rVacgag or Vac/wt displayed a fast weight loss, 15% and 20% respectively. The results obtained suggest that MVb2-HIV-gag is induced functional T cells immunity that protected immunized animals against recombinant Vac-gag. Mice were immunized with MVb2-HIV-gag or not (Naive) and each group was split to groups and 10 days later two groups were challenged with wild-type vaccinia (Vac-wt) or recombinant Vaccinia expressing HIV-1-gag (Vacgag).

We demonstrated previously the effectiveness of rMVb vector against SIV and SARS-CoV [11, 18] . In this manuscript we demonstrate that expression of HIV antigens remains genetically stable, after serial passages in MCR5 cells as shown by immunocytochemistry and sequencing. The replication kinetics of the rMV-HIVs followed the same trend as the parental MVb vaccine. Such behaviour is particularly favourable for rMVb vaccine candidates over other members 20] , suggesting a high fidelity of MV RNA polymerase. The plasticity of MV and its ability to stably express foreign genes (HIV-1 genes in this study) after multiple passages, suggest that MV is a robust and superior delivery system in comparison to other RNA virus vectors. Unlike MV, many RNA viruses are unable to accommodate large foreign sequence in their icosahedral capsids and often rapidly lose even small inserts due to their dependence on RNA secondary and tertiary structures as well as high levels of recombination. The MVb-based system has several advantages as a live viral vector. It uses an MV strain which is already in use as a safe and efficacious vaccine [13] . The production cost of standard MV vaccines is very low and the current MV vaccine is well-known to induce a life-long immunity. Here we demonstrated that rMV-HIV candidate vaccine production is up-scalable and that the end virus titers were comparable to those of the standard MV vaccine. Furthermore, parental and recombinant MVb viruses were shown to induce comparable anti-MV immune responses. These features are particularly important if mass immunization is envisaged for developing countries. In this regard, the use of MV vector cocktails delivering simultaneously several additional antigens could be envisaged instead of the routine MV vaccination in early childhood.",
