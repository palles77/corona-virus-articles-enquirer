The aim of the present study was to characterize the production of cytokines by subpopulations of pulmonary macrophages in pigs infected by the PRRS virus (PRRSV). Expression of interleukin (IL) 1a, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a correlated with the severity of pulmonary pathology and the numbers of pulmonary macrophages. Significant correlations were observed between PRRSV infection and the expression of IL-10, between the expression of IL-12p40 and interferon (IFN)-g, and between the expression of TNF-a and IFN-g. These findings suggest that PRRSV modulates the immune response by the upregulation of IL-10, which may in turn reduce expression of cytokines involved in viral clearance (e.g. IFN-a, IFN-g, IL-12p40 and TNF-a). The results also suggest that expression of IFN-g is stimulated by IL-12p40 and TNF-a, but not by IFN-a. All of these cytokines were expressed mainly by septal macrophages with weaker expression by alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. There appears to be differential activation of septal and alveolar macrophages in PRRSV infection, with septal macrophages being the major source of cytokines.",

Cytokines may also be synthesized by several other immune or non-immune cells including lymphocytes, neutrophils and fibroblasts. The expression of cytokines following engagement of PRRs by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) constitutes the main pathway involved in the activation of macrophages (Zhang and Mosser, 2008) . Some cyto-kines may also act as inhibitors of macrophage activation. For example, interleukin (IL)-12, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interferon (IFN)-a and IFN-g act as potent activators of macrophages, whereas IL-10 inhibits activation of these cells (Mitchell and Kumar, 2004) .",

The avidinebiotineperoxidase complex technique (ABC) was used for the detection of PRRSV, macrophages and cytokine proteins as described previously (Hsu et al., 1981) . Formalin-fixed tissue was used for detection of macrophages and tissue fixed in Bouin's solution for all other immunohistochemical reactions. Briefly, the sections were dewaxed and dehydrated through graded ethanol and the endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in H 2 O 2 3% in methanol for 30 min. The sections were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4, 0.01 M) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 ml per slide of blocking solution in a humid chamber. Table 1 describes the primary antibodies and antigen retrieval methods applied. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 C in a humid chamber. In each case the corresponding biotinylated secondary antibody was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. An avidineperoxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California) was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Labelling was 'visualized' by application of the NovaRED\u00d4 substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted. For negative controls, the primary antibody was replaced by blocking solution, normal serum and isotypematched reagents of irrelevant specificity.",

The present study has characterized expression of cytokines by pulmonary macrophages in order to determine the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of the respiratory form of PRRS. The experimental infection did not lead to the animals developing respiratory symptoms, but dullness, weight loss, mild hyperthermia and lesions of the pulmonary parenchyma were observed. PRRSV replication peaked at 7 dpi and was mainly localized to alveolar macrophages, which are considered as the target cell for viral replication (Molitor et al., 1997; Bautista and Molitor, 1999) . No correlation was observed between the presence of viral antigen and the severity of the microscopical lung lesions. However, the microscopical lung lesions were significantly correlated with marked inflammatory infiltration of the septa and the number of infiltrating macrophages. Moreover, the lung lesions showed significant correlation with the expression of both IL-1a and IL-6, but not of TNF-a, and macrophage counts were correlated with the expression of IL-1a and TNF-a, but not of IL-6. These observations suggest that IL-1a may play a significant role in the development of interstitial pneumonia during PRRS. Nonetheless, when all the three proinflammatory cytokines were considered, a highly significant correlation was observed between both microscopical pulmonary lesions and macrophage counts.",

IFN-a participates in the innate immune response and is able to induce synthesis of IFN-g (Biron and Sen, 2001; Tizard, 2008) . In the present study, a significant correlation was observed between PRRSV replication and IFN-a expression, suggesting that PRRSV directly induces expression of IFN-a by macrophages. However, PRRSV induces lower levels of IFN-a when compared with other porcine respiratory viral diseases, such as those caused by swine influenza virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus (Van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000) , which indicates that IFN-a expression may be insufficient to induce clearance of PRRSV. The expression of IFN-g by macrophages and lymphocytes has been previously reported in the lung of PRRSV-infected pigs (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2003) . In that study, an increase in expression of IFN-g was observed at 10 dpi for infection with highly virulent strains, whereas strains of low virulence induced a higher expression at the end of the study (28 dpi). In the present study, the expression of IFN-g was undulating, showing a peak at 7 dpi, just when PRRSV replication was maximal. IFN-g is known to protect macrophages in vitro against PRRSV replication (Bautista and Molitor, 1999) ; however, that viral replication occurred throughout the period of the present study may suggest that in this experimental infection the IFN-g response was not strong enough to eliminate PRRSV infection.",

Therefore, the expression of IL-10 observed in the present study might be responsible for reduced expression of cytokines such as IFN-a, IFN-g, IL-12p40 and TNF-a, that in turn may impair prolonged viral replication in the lung of infected animals. Interestingly, the expression of IL-10 was observed in areas of lung that showed no expression of IFN-g. Moreover, the expression of IL-10 was significantly correlated with PRRSV replication. These results suggest that PRRSV may induce the expression of IL-10 and, therefore, the expression of IL-10 might inhibit the expression of other cytokines, allowing a prolonged viral replication in the lung.
