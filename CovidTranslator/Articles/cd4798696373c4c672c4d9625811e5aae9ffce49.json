            "text": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a spherical and non-enveloped virus belonging to the genus Circovirus of the Circoviridae family with a single stranded circular DNA genome. This virus, already detected worldwide, has been associated to several diseases and was implicated as the etiological agent of a disease named postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. Several methods have been described for the detection of PCV2, being real-time PCR the most simple and reliable. As far as we know, all the real-time PCR systems described until now are based on ORF2 gene, that exhibit the highest variability. This paper reports the development and validation of a real-time PCR targeted to ORF1 and based on a TaqMan probe for the detection of porcine circovirus type 2 DNA in swine samples. Due to the lack of PCV1 samples, the ability of the test to discriminate between PCV1 and PCV2 positive samples was evaluated in silico. Estimations of 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity were obtained based on the qPCR results with panel of 81 swine samples (known PCV2-positive (n = 50); known PCV2-negative (n = 17); samples positive to other common swine viral pathogens (n = 13) and one sample from a BFDV-positive parrot (n = 1)). Intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation obtained with three positive samples of different viral charges in five replicates or in five independent assays were below the acceptance threshold. The limit of detection determined with a recombinant plasmid containing the amplicon, led to conclude that this assay can detect at least three plasmid copies.",

This disease of pigs is clinically characterised by growth retardation, paleness of skin, dyspnoea, enlargement of inguinal lymph nodes and occasionally jaundice and diarrhoea. Besides PMWS, other diseases have been associated to PCV2, namely porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), reproductive failure, proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia, congenital tremors and central nervous system diseases [6] . PCV2 infection has a serious economic impact on the swine industry worldwide, having been diagnosed in the five continents [5] . Although mortality is comparatively low (4-20%), morbidity can reach up to 50-60% in affected farms [15] . However, since vaccination was introduced in 2006 [4] , the occurrence of PMWS has declined abruptly [13] . The presence of PCV2 in healthy pigs suggests that although the virus presence is crucial to induce PMWS, additional factors are also involved in the development of clinical disease [5] .",

The genome, of about 1768 nucleotides, is circular and single stranded [11] . PCV2 was initially demonstrated by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays [3] and direct detection of viral antigen or DNA in tissue lesions by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization, respectively [12] . After that, quantitative PCR [2] and loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) PCR [22] were reported for the identification of PCV2. More recently, DNA microarrays [8] , as well as isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification assays, were described for the diagnosis of PCV2 in pigs [18] . Other real-time PCR reactions were reported [19] [20] [21] , all of them based on ORF2, in which the variability observed among strains is higher than in ORF1. Moreover, one of the reactions [19] uses SYBR Green technology, less accurate, detecting a minimum of 1000 copies; while the other two, based on a TaqMan Probe exhibit limits of detection of 10 [21] and 25 [20] . The detection of PCV2 antibodies are commonly performed by ELISA using commercial kits.",

To determine intra-assay variability, five replicates of three positive samples with different Ct (cycle threshold) values (low, medium and high Ct values) were tested in the same assay. On the other hand, inter-assay variability was evaluated by testing the three samples in five independent assays. In both cases, the coefficient of variation (%CV) was determined by dividing the standard deviation by the average of the Ct values obtained. The DNA sample used for the determination of the intra-assay variability for medium Ct value was not the same that the one used for the determination of the inter-assay variability.",

For the construction of pCirc, the complete genome of a PCV2 strain detected in our laboratory in 2005 (GenBank accession number HQ831532) was amplified using reverse complement overlapping primers, SacF (5 0 -GAACCGCGGGCTGGCTGAACTTTTGAAAGT-3 0 ) and SacR (5 0 -GCACCGCGGAAATTTCTGACAAACGTT ACA-3 0 ), including the SacII restriction site. The amplicon was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), originating the TA-CircSac recombinant. Another fragment of 850 bp comprising the region between EcoRI and SacII restriction sites, amplified with primers EcoF (5 0 -GCGGAATT-CAACCTTAACCTTTCTTATTCT-3 0 ) and SacR, was cloned into pEGFP vector (Clontech), giving rise to pCircEcoSac. The infectious clone was constructed after restriction of both plasmids with SacII restriction enzyme by cloning CircSac fragment of TA-CircSac into pCircE-coSac, using One Shot TOP10F' chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen), originating pCirc. The plasmid, with a total size of 7325 bp, was extracted using the Plasmid Midi Purification kit (Qiagen) and the concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm.

For negative samples, the Ct value was considered to be Ct = 40, but since the unpaired t-test cannot be performed in a set of equal values, one of the negative Ct value was assumed to be Ct = 40.0001. The averages of Ct values as well as the standard deviation are represented. Means and respective standard errors (SEM) were 18.86 \u00b1 1.040 (n = 50) for positive samples and 40 \u00b1 0.000 (n = 31) for negative DNA samples",
