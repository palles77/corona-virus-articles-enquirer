LRD has been used to identify potential treatments or preventative actions for challenging medical problems, among myriad other applications. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first pandemic of the 21st century. SARS was eventually controlled through increased hygienic measures (e.g., face mask protection, frequent hand washing, living quarter disinfection), travel restrictions, and quarantine. According to recent reviews of SARS, none of the drugs that were used during the pandemic worked. For the present paper, SARS was selected as the first application of LRD to an infectious disease. The main goal of this research was to identify non-drug non-surgical treatments that would 1) prevent the occurrence, or 2) reduce the progression rate, or 3) stop/reverse the progression of SARS. The MeSH taxonomy of Medline was used to restrict potential discoveries to selected semantic classes, and to identify potential discoveries efficiently. To enhance the volume of potential discovery, databases were used in addition to Medline. These included the Science Citation Index (SCI) and, in contrast to previous work, a full text database. Because of the richness of the full text, 'surgical' queries were developed that targeted the exact types of potential discovery of interest while eliminating clutter more efficiently.",

There needs to be value-added in the novel concept(s) that results. Second, while the term 'potential discovery' is used in this paper and throughout the LRD literature, 'hypothesis' is more accurate. What results from these LRD 'discovery' studies are hypotheses that have to be tested in the laboratory/field before they can be properly termed 'discoveries'. E-mail address: ronald.kostoff@pubpolicy.gatech.edu. 1 The MITRE Corporation (Retired). A 2009 review paper by the author showed that, while a number of LRD published papers claimed to have generated potential discovery, essentially none of these claims could be validated [1] . The only published LRD potential discovery claims that could be validated as credible hypotheses were in a journal Special Issue devoted to LRD (e.g., [2, 3] ). The four medical papers in this Special Issue describe the application of ODS LRD to four chronic diseases: Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP), cataracts, Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).",

The amount of potential discovery retrieved from the directly related literature alone (including the full text directly related literature) is voluminous. A major challenge is to select those combinations of potential discoveries that provide the maximum synergy. Until these potential discoveries have been exploited, there is little practical need of going to indirectly related literatures to search for yet more potential discovery. In the practical situation, even the potential innovation as defined above has not been exploited, and accelerating these potential innovations should be the first order of business [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] .",

Because of the richness of the full text, 'surgical' queries were developed that targeted the exact types of potential discovery of interest while eliminating clutter more efficiently. The 'surgical' nature of these queries compensated for the additional 'noise' characteristic of the more voluminous full text. However, since the full text database (Science Direct-SD) did not have an associated MeSH taxonomy, the MeSH taxonomy headings were essentially used as text phrases to restrict SARS treatment and prevention potential discoveries to selected substances. The Science Citation Index (SCI) was also used to search for discovery, and again the MeSH taxonomy headings were used as text phrases to restrict potential discoveries to selected substances. Approximately four times as many records were retrieved from Medline when MeSH terms were included in the query compared to using only terms in the title or Abstract, due to the greater choice of potential discovery substances. This means the SCI or SD queries as presently constituted will retrieve only about 25% of the records that are possible using MeSH to define the substance pool.",

However, a detailed examination of the SARS literature showed inconsistencies in the desired directions of some of these items, based on clinical observations and data. This led to examination of functional groupings at a higher level of aggregation (e.g., inhibit viral replication, enhance humoral immunity, improve cell-mediated immunity, increase Th1, etc.), which could accommodate different directions at the lowest level of detail while achieving the targets represented by the higher level of aggregation.",

This resulted in an order of magnitude more retrieved and relevant articles (when searching Abstracts), although still small compared to the retrievals obtained from searching full text. Type 2 queries focused on enhancing the performance of the different components of the immune system. There were a number of variants of the Type 2 query shown above that were examined. Appendix 1 of Ref. [54] shows the form of the query used to generate the SCI results. The Type 2 entry under the T component is for 'Improv*', but the full query added blocks that replaced 'Improv*' with Enhanc* or Induc* or Stimulat* or Increas* or Activat* or Regulat*.

To overcome this deficiency, the author developed an algorithm that would provide such capability [25] . In the algorithm, SCI stopwords are used to set spacing between terms. Thus, a query term of the form [improv*-of-humoral-immun*] will retrieve those records containing variants of improv* that precede variants of 'humoral-immun*' with one word intercalated. The intercalated word could be any word, not just the stopword used in the query. As can be seen from the terms in Appendix 1of Ref. [54] , the actual query used did not go beyond precedence spacings of two words, but a larger production-oriented study could use greater spacings between the terms of interest.

Vaccinia virus replication is significantly abrogated upon ATA treatment, which is associated with the inhibition of early viral gene transcription. This inhibitory effect may be attributed to two findings. First, ATA blocks the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, an event shown to be essential for vaccinia virus replication. Second, ATA inhibits the phosphatase activity of the viral enzyme H1L, which is required to initiate viral transcription. Thus, ATA inhibits vaccinia virus replication by targeting both cellular and viral factors essential for the early stage of replication\" [26] .",

In the present application, a somewhat different approach was taken. Since the characteristics of those who had succumbed to SARS tended to be sub-optimal performance of different immune system components, the query combined the immune system components at a higher aggregation level with functional terminology designed to improve this performance (e.g., enhance humoral immunity). Such a query structure allowed a large number of potential discovery candidates to be identified. As the previous paragraph shows, much more is possible in terms of potential discovery volume.",
