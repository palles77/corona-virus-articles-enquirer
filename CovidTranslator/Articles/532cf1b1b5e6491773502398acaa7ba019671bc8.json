This is because a wide spectrum of pathological impairments emerge in the later part of the human life course which sharply increase mortality and reduce quality of life. Dysfunction of the immune system with advancing age is of crucial importance to the development of disability in later life and finally death. Understanding immune ageing, immunosenescence, has long been recognised as an essential prerequisite for the delivery of effective interventions which will improve late life health. Ten years ago, the ImAginE consortium undertook a broad ranging series of projects which added significantly to our understanding of how fundamental ageing mechanisms drove immune decline. In the decade which followed, abundant evidence has accumulated from nonhuman model systems that ageing results from the progressive operation of a relatively few common processes which act across the major organ systems. These advances in fundamental understanding both allow better clarification of the potential crosssystem dysregulation that occurs in ageing and open new avenues for intervention. Over the course of a 2day workshop, the original ImAginE participants have considered these issues and present some suggestions for current priority areas in immunosenescence.",

            "text": "Why did ageing evolve and what are the implications for the immune system? Whilst identifying ageing at the level of populations of organisms is relatively uncomplicated (the increase in age-specific mortality underlying the Gompertz relationship) (Hirsch and Peretz 1984) , a definition of ageing which works well for individual members of the population has proved a little more contentious. Ageing is often defined as a lesser capacity for maintaining homeostasis under conditions of physiological stress compared to younger counterparts (Comfort 1979) . Thus, the increased likelihood of death of older humans under conditions of cold and the increased likelihood of death of older yeast cells and the conditions of UV irradiation share a common hallmark which defines these as ageing changes. Unfortunately, there are many reasons for failures of homeostasis and not all of them could be counted as ageing. Researchers wishing to use a more precise definition often cite that of Strehler (1977) who considered the defining features of ageing to be that it was universal, progressive, intrinsic and, above all, degenerative, but what is the evolutionary rationale for ageing when it clearly compromises organismal survival? Medawar (1952) recognised that in wild populations, extrinsic mortality is the major component of total mortality. As a result, chronologically old animals are rare even if the organism in question does not show an ageing process. Under such conditions, early acting deleterious mutations are strongly selected against since they affect the ability of organisms to pass the genes to the next generation, but harmful mutations that occur later in the life course are not exposed to this selection pressure. 'Ageing' therefore develops and results from the accumulation of these late-acting deleterious mutations.",

Such genes exert favourable effects on early life fecundity (when the effect of natural selection is strong), but deleterious ones in later life when the effect of natural selection is weak. The predictions of antagonistic pleiotropy (e.g. that fertility and longevity are negatively correlated) have been confirmed in experiments using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Postponing reproduction increased life expectancy, and conversely, decreased fertility was observed in long-lived flies (Rose and Charlesworth 1981) . Pleiotropic effects can occur both not only at the level of individual genes (e.g. p53 which plays a key role in the cellular anticancer mechanism at the cost of suppressing stem cell proliferation and survival) but also at the level of global processes such as immunity.",

One plausible source of this endogenous 'noise' is the senescenceassociated secretory phenotype. This is a spectrum of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by 'senescent' cells which have permanently exited the cell cycle and which are known to accumulate to significant numbers with advancing age (compromising health status) (Tchkonia et al. 2013) . Alongside with this, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) also become more frequent with advancing age. DAMPs are proteins which are usually sequestered in the cytosol but are released because of cell necrosis resulting from a range of agerelated conditions (e.g. stroke and myocardial infarction). Interestingly, DAMPs include two preformed but poorly secreted members of the IL-1 family (e.g. IL-1\u03b1) which are also made by senescent cells indicating potential overlap between senescence and sterile inflammation (Berda-Haddad et al. 2011; Burton et al. 2009 ).",

Continued exposure to DAMPs and the steady increase in senescent cells also have the potential to produce dysregulation of inflammatory networks and a resulting state of chronic inflammation. The consortium members speculated that the low-grade chronic inflammation seen in ageing mammals (q.v.) is not only the result of chronic antigenic stress but also of a complex combination of genetically determined competency to produce a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile, senescent cells and DAMPs.

Many changes in immune function previously attributed to ageing are less pronounced in optimally healthy elderly people selected by the SENIEUR protocol.

This is consistent with 'successful' immune ageing. Thus, from a practical research perspective, there is a pressing need to understand what accounts for this small fraction of exceptionally healthy people whatever the reason for their happy state.

Ageing is also characterised by a dysregulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory networks, resulting in a low-grade chronic proinflammatory status (sometimes termed 'inflammaging'), with persistent low-grade innate immune activation.

The changes in the humoral immune response during ageing significantly contribute to the increased susceptibility of the elderly to infectious diseases and reduce the protective effects of vaccination.

This may suffer from a lack of optimal T cell help in ageing, but intrinsic changes in B cells also occur and have a significant impact on antibody production. These changes include a decrease in activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme responsible for class switch recombination, and in the transcription factor E47 that regulates its expression.

In general, the number and frequency of na\u00efve T cells is lower in adults than in children and far lower in old adults. This is likely due to three factors: (i) thymic involution, resulting in a lower na\u00efve T cell output; (ii) pathogen encounter by na\u00efve cells (in early life), their differentiation to anti-pathogen effector cells and then the conversion of a small fraction of them to memory cells to maintain immune protection against the same pathogen throughout life; and (iii) homeostatic proliferation of the peripheral T cell pool.

This subsumes both periods of acute infection and chronic stimulation from persistent viral infections. In humans infection with the beta-herpesvirus HHV5 (cytomegalovirus, CMV) appears to be a major player in the latter context. Why this particular virus, and not other, even closely related herpes viruses have this effect is not known and is now beginning to be intensely investigated (Solana et al. 2012) . CMV is only pathogenic under extreme circumstances (neonatal infection, iatrogenic immunosuppression and AIDS). However, unique amongst the herpes viruses and as far as we know unique amongst any immune challenges (even including alloreactivity), CMV infection results in the commitment of significant immune resources to immunosurveillance in order to maintain the virus in a latent state. This level of commitment increases with age until a significant portion of the CD8 T cells are devoted to CMV suppression with marked consequences for systemic and physiology. Thus, CMV is a driver of the accumulation of late-stage differentiated CD8+ T cells, which are distinguishing features of the 'immune risk profile' predicting mortality in longitudinal studies of the very elderly. They may be responsible for the emerging consensus that there are negative survival consequences of CMV infection even in earlier life as also reflected in the impact of CMV infection on responsiveness to influenza vaccination . We are slowly approaching a more mechanistic explanation of how these deleterious effects may be mediated and gaining an appreciation of inter-individual differences which may inform manipulations to improve clinical outcomes (Derhovanessian et al. 2013; Bartlett et al. 2012) .",

Although influenza vaccines currently provide some protection, they must be reformulated every year, and the time lag between the spread of a pandemic virus and the availability of a vaccine is worryingly lengthy. Newly emerging infectious diseases, such as swine-origin H1N1 and avian H5N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome and dengue fever are a constant threat, and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella outbreaks in the food industry, are costly to the society. However, vaccines in general were originally developed for young adults and pre-existing immunity in the target population is not considered. ImAginE participants noted that previous exposure to influenza strains is largely age dependent, which implies that the ideal influenza vaccine (strain composition and dosage) will differ between young and elderly populations. The importance of preexisting immunity to influenza is best illustrated by the relatively low impact of the swine-origin influenza virus epidemic in middle age and elderly subjects (who were previously exposed to H1N1 influenza viruses) (Verma et al. 2012 May) . Adjuvanted influenza (Hatz et al. 2012) or high-dose influenza vaccines show improved immunogenicity in elderly subjects and may confer better protection as compared to the 'standard' influenza vaccine (Cools et al. 2009 ). One difficulty in the development of more effective vaccines is the lack of predictors of efficacy although there are signs of progress in this area (Derhovanessian et al. 2013 ). These are needed because different individuals show different responses to vaccination, and not every vaccinated individual will mount a protective cellular or humoral immune response. There are emerging immunological indicators for determining who is likely to respond and who not at the level of the antigen-presenting cell (van Duin et al. 2007 ) and in terms of the measurement of pre-existing T cell reactivity to shared influenza antigens (Derhovanessian et al. 2013) . Recent advances in molecular biology and proteomics have made possible genome-wide measurements of levels of transcripts and their splice variants, non-coding RNAs, metabolites, proteins, epigenetic changes and germline polymorphisms, thus opening new frontiers to vaccinology. High-throughput multi-omics data have been used to construct predictive models of interactions between the biological components of the pathogen-host system, obtain a global picture of the immune responses to vaccination in humans and identify early gene signatures that correlate with and predict later immune responses to vaccination. This approach has allowed the identification of predictors of vaccine responses (for influenza and yellow fever so far). However, it has not, as yet, provided mechanistic insights on how a given vaccine elicits protective immunity. Therefore, a multibiomarker characterisation of responders and nonresponders is warranted. During the ImAginE meeting, a wide range of potential biomarkers were proposed. These included cellular biomarkers (e.g. B and T lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils), molecular biomarkers (e.g. cytokines and antibodies produced in vitro and transcription factors) and systemic biomarkers (e.g. CMV load, pro-and antiinflammatory cytokine levels, hormones, micro-RNAs, mitDNA, microbial DNA and metabolites/nutrition). Future research in the biomarker area thus has the potential to first stratify the older population and then improve the percentage of older responders.",

Data from the Schwartz group suggest that functional cell-mediated immunity is required for the maintenance of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory (Ron-Harel et al. 2008) . Immunedeficient mice show an impaired spatial memory phenotype which can be rescued by immune reconstitution. Conversely, compromising the immune system of young mice also impairs their spatial memory. The same researchers have shown that memory loss in aged mice is attributable to age-related attenuation of the immune response, a phenotype which could be rescued by expansion of the existing T cell repertoire. These are exciting observations which suggest that the immune system plays a major but previously unsuspected role in the maintenance and repair of the normal CNS (Schwartz et al. 2009; Schwartz and Shechter 2010) .

Burton (2009) was amongst the first to propose that this inflammatory phenotype might play a functional role in both signalling and facilitating immune clearance. Almost simultaneously, Krizhanovsky and colleagues demonstrated that natural killer cells preferentially kill senescentactivated stellate cells in vitro and in vivo, facilitating the resolution of liver fibrosis (Krizhanovsky et al. 2008 ). Clearance has recently been shown to be primarily dependent on granule exocytosis by NK cells rather than death-receptor-mediated due to upregulation of a decoy death receptor by the senescent targets (Sagiv et al. 2012) . However, since the phenotype of senescent cells is very variable across tissues, it may be premature to assume that this bias in pathway usage is a global phenomenon ).",

Interestingly, this has come to light at the same time that the longstanding view that only the adaptive immune system is able to build up immunological memory is being re-evaluated. Memory properties for NK cells monocytes and macrophages (in many ways exemplars of innate immunity) have recently been described (a phenomenon known as 'trained immunity') (Netea et al. 2011) . It has become clear that the set point for production of inflammatory cytokines by the innate immune system can be modulated by either BCG vaccination or infection with Candida albicans (Kleinnijenhuis et al. 2012; Quintin et al. 2012) . This change appears to be epigenetic and persists for up to a year. How this plays into immune senescence remains unclear, and thus, the time is probably right for the role of the immune system in ageing not to simply be ImAginEd but 'Re-ImAginEd'.",
