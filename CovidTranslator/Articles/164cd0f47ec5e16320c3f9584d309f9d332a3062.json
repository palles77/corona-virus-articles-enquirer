We 22 would like to share our experience from Thailand, the second country in which the COVID-23 19 infection occurred since early January 2020 [2]. At present (5th March 2020), there are 48 24 accumulated COVID-19 cases in Thailand. Amongst these 48 cases, there was an interesting 25 case that presented with a skin rash with petechiae. Because dengue is very common in our 26 setting and petichiae rash is a common clinical finding in dengue and the patient also had low 27 platelet count, a clinical diagnosis of dengue was made by the first physician in-charge. There 28 was no photograph and biopsy was not done since because biopsy is not a routine practice 29 according to dengue clinical practice guideline in our tropical setting. The case was initially 30 misdiagnosed as dengue which resulted in a delayed diagnosis [3]. In this case, the patient 31 further presented respiratory problems and was referred to the tertiary medical center. Other 32 common virus infections that might cause fever, rash and respiratory problem were ruled out 33 by laboratory investigation and the final diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was by RT-PCR. 34 There is a possibility that a COVID-19 patient might initially present with a skin rash that can 35 be misdiagnosed as another common disease. Additionally some of these patients are afebrile 36 initially[4]. The practitioner should recognize the possibility that the patient might have only 37 a skin rash and think of this disease to prevent transmission.",
