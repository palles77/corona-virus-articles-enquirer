            "text": "Another approach used in early studies was the attempted induction of disease in volunteers by administration of infectious, bacteria-free fecal filtrates under controlled conditions. In 194 7, Gordon et al. \"' first demonstrated that epidemic gastroenteritis could be transmitted to volunteers by the oral ingestion of fecal filtrates derived from ill patients, but not by inhalation of nebulized throat washings from ill subjects. The infectious agent was designated the Marcy strain. Rechallenge studies suggested that immunity of reinfection with the Marcy strain persisted for at least 15 months, 16 but cross-immunity to a second agent, the FS strain, from a different epidemic was not found. 17 When frozen, the fecal filtrates remained infectious for at least 3 years. 16 Similar studies at that time in Japan yielded an inoculum (Niigata strain) which caused gastroenteritis and could be passaged serially through multiple generations of volunteers. 18 Six infectious agents, the Marcy and Niigata strains and four other inocula from other parts of Japan, were studied by cross-challenge tests. Volunteers were infected with the Marcy strain or one of the four other inocula and then rechallenged within 49 days with the Niigata strain. No illness resulted from the second challenge, suggesting a close immunological relationship or identity among these six agents. 18 \u2022 19 However, failure to identify or culture a specific etiological agent led to the abandonment of further research with these well studied inocula.",

Mild to marked vomiting without diarrhea was observed in some volunteers and mild to severe diarrhea without vomiting was seen in others; still others developed both vomiting and diarrhea, although all received identical inocula. 28 Low grade fever , abdominal cramps, malaise, anorexia, headache, and myalgias frequently accompanied the diarrhea and vomiting. Laboratory studies remained normal except for an occasional mild transient leukocytosis. 28 No prolonged illness or long term sequelae have been observed in volunteers ingesting inocula containing parvovirus-like agents. 30 Physical characteristics . The Norwalk agent is relatively stable after exposure to ether, acid, or heat. Infectivity persists after heating to 60\u00b0C for 30 min, after exposure to 20% ether for 24 hr at 4\u00b0C, and after exposure to pH 2.7 for 3 hr at room temperature. 3 1 In 1972, Kapikian and co-workers 32 identified particles 27 nm in diameter in the infectious filtrate utilizing the technique of negative staining with immune electron microscopy, and then determined that the density of the particles in cesium chloride was 1.38 to 1.41 g per ml.3 3 Subsequently infectious filtrates containing Hawaii and MC agents were found to contain morphologically indis-tinguishable particles 26 to 29 nm in diameter with a density in CsC1 2 of 1.37 to 1.39 g per ml.3 4 These physical characteristics of gastroenteritis-causing agents are comparable to those of known DNA-containing parvoviruses, 33 although definitive classification awaits laboratory propagation of the agents.",

No experimental animals have been reported to be susceptible to Norwalk a,gent; rhesus monkeys, guinea pigs, rabbits, and mice have remained well after innoculation with the Norwalk agent. 30 Human Reovirus-like Agent of Infantile Gastroenteritis (HRVL) Epidemiology . A reovirus-like agent, which has been termed duovirus, rotavirus, orbivirus, and infantile gastroenteritis virus, by different investigators, appears to be responsible for both sporadic and epidemic outbreaks of gastroenteritis in infants and young children throughout the world. 3 :;...~2 During two separate yearlong surveys, approximately 50% of all children hospitalized with gastroenteritis had evidence of infection with the reovirus-like agent. 43 \u2022 H The peak prevalence of HRVL disease may approach 90% among infants and young children with acute gastroenteritis during the winter months and fall to 20 % during the summer months. 35 \u2022 40 \u2022 ~3--~5 Clinical infection is most common in the 6-to 24-month age group but also occurs in the neonatal period. 4 3--'' 0 An unexplained male to female ratio of 3:2 has been observed in hospitalized patients. 44 \u2022 50 Transmission is presumed to be from person to person by the fecal-oral route :' 1 Nosocomial spread has been observed. 52 -54 There is evidence that subclinical infection with HRVL occurs quite often in adult relatives of infected infants. 4 1 \u2022 44 In one study 35% of the parents who were evaluated had evidence of HRVL infection by either serological tests or demonstration of HRVL in stool specimens. 44 HRVL infection in adults occasionally may be associated with diarrhea. 4 1 \u2022 44 Clinical features . The clinical, pathophysiological, and histopathological features of reovirus-like agentinduced gastroenteritis have been determined in patients with naturally occurring infection. Diarrhea is the symptom by which infants with naturally occurring HRVL gastroenteritis are recognized, and by definition, has been present in 100% of patients. The duration of diarrhea varies but it may persist for as long as 5 to 8 days. 4 1 \u2022 50 \u2022 54 \u2022 55 Vomiting may precede or occur concomitantly with diarrhea. Fever and lymphocytosis occur in 50 to 60%. 4 4 \u2022 50 \u2022 54 Pharyngeal and tympanic membrane erythema accompanied gastrointestinal symptoms in 40 to 50% in one study. 44 The indication for hospitalization generally is dehydration requiring intravenous fluids . Death attributable to HRVL gastroenteritis, although rare, has been reported. 3 \" Physical characteristics. This virus was first identified in 1973 by Bishop et al. \" 1 ;  in electron micrographs of biopsies of duodenal mucosa obtained during acute gastroenteritis in young children, and was subsequently recognized in negatively stained electron microscopic preparations of stool suspensions from sick children . \u2022n. '' 7 The HRVL particle is approximately 70 nm in diameter with a double-shelled capsid . Some particles are seen with the outer shell absent; these measure approximately 60 nm in diameter. Empty shells are also frequently seen. The virus appears to contain a 37-nm hexagonal core when viewed with the electron microscope using negative stains. The core seems to be surrounded by an electron-lucent layer from which capsomeres radiate. The surface is composed of 32 capsomeres. \"8 Which of the structural components are necessary and sufficient for infectivity and antigenic r ecognition has not been determined as yet. The density in CsCl 2 has been shown to be 1.29 to 1.30 g per m l for empty shells and 1.36 to 1.37 g per ml for complete particles; double shell particles tend to aggregate at 1.37 g per ml and single shell particles aggregate at 1.36 g per mP~1 The physical structure of this virus is extremely stable and it can be recognized easily by electron microscopy after storage at -20\u00b0C for up to 9 years. 4~ Whether or not infectivity persists after prolonged storage of the virus is not known.",

Although examination of stools for HRVL particles by electron microscopy is quite simple, the technique is time consuming and requires trained personnel and equipment not universally available. The detection of viral antigen in the stools of children with HRVL gastroenteritis has recently been reported using the technique of counterimmunoelectroosmophoresis. 88 \u00b7 89 For this, stool suspensions are placed in one well of an agarose slide. Antiserum produced in guinea pigs after immunization with HRVL is placed in an adjacent well. 8 !1 After appropriate incubation and application of an electrical current, a characteristic precipitin line develops between the wells of stool suspensions which contain HRVL particles and the wells of antisera, but not between control stool specimens and antisera. This precipitin band has been shown by electron microscopy to contain viral particles. 89 The technique appears to have approximately the same sensitivity and specificity as does electron microscopy of stool suspensions, but can be used to screen large numbers of specimens rapidly and does not require an electron microscope. 89 HRVL-complement fixation. Serum serological tests have been developed, extensively tested, and compared to the efficacy of stool examination by electron microscopy. Kapikian and co-workers 38 demonstrated a rise in serum antibody titer to HRVL stool antigen with a complement fixation (CF) test using acute and convalescent sera of infants who excreted the HRVL in their stools. The concordance between IEM and CF was 85% in their large series. 44 Because of the limited quantity of HRVL stock antigen available, a related reovirus-like agent called the Nebraska calf diarrhea virus (NCDV) is often used as a substitute antigen in place of the HRVL. 38 \u2022 90 The NCDV, which causes diarrhea in infant calves, 91 is morphologically identical to and antigentically related to the HRVL. 38 \u00b7 90 (See relevant animal models below.) When tissue culture-grown NCDV is used as antigen for the CF tests and is compared with the CF test which uses crude stools containing HRVL as antigen, the concordance is 80% at-best. In such comparative studies, HRVL is clearly more efficient in detecting human antibody response. 44 \u00b7 55 \u2022 92 \u00b7 93 Nonetheless, the NCDV has been substituted for HRVL in some laboratories because it can be readily grown in tissue culture and therefore is available in the quantities required.",

However, acute as well as convalescent sera reacted with the antigen. Wyatt and co-workers62 used human fetal intestinal organ cultures infected with the HRVL as the antigen to examine the sera of infants with gastroenteritis for antibody by indirect immunofluorescence.

Experimental infection with the Norwalk agent results in resistance to reinfection with the same agent for at least 14 weeks. 31 However, within 3 years after infection, immunity to reinfection with the Norwalk agent is lost (Parrino et al., unpublished results). In the original outbreak of Norwalk gastroenteritis, 2 ill patients who did not develop a measurable rise in serum antibody titer by IEM during convalescence had high levels of antibody in their sera obtained during acute illness. 32 This would suggest that the presence of serum antibody to Norwalk agent as measured by IEM is not sufficient for immunity. Whether immunity to one parvovirus-like agent provides at least temporary protection against infection with other agents is not fully resolved. The Norwalk and Hawaii agents appear to be antigenically distinct, and infection with either agent provides no protection against infection with the other agent. 26 An immunological relationshp between the Norwalk and MC agents has been suggested based on (1) a slight rise in serum IEM antibody titer to the Norwalk agent after infection with the MC agent in a single patient, and (2) the inability to induce overt clinical disease with MC agent after recovery from Norwalk enteritis in 8 volunteers. 26 However, experimental illness with the MC agent often resulted in mild symptoms which were difficult to evaluate.",

The fatality rate is 50 to 90%. 101 A characteristic finding is marked leukopenia with WBC generally less than 3000 and often less than 500. 101 Histopathological findings include necrosis of the epithelium of villus tips in the small bowel, ballooning of surface cells, and loss of the basal nuclear polarity of epithelial cells. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions are seen in the crypt epithelial cells. Mesenteric lymph nodes are characterized by lymphocyte depletion and reticuloendothelial cell hyperplasia, whereas the bone marrow shows a marked decrease in myeloid precursors. 102 The FPL virus replicates in tissue culture monolayers of kitten kidney cells, providing the cells are dividing rapidly. 103 Serological methods such as serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests are available for the detection of infection with FPL or mink enteritis virus. 104 Reovirus-like agents. Enteric infection of young animals with reovirus-like agents appears to be widespread throughout the animal kingdom. The viruses about which the most is known are those which infect the calf (NCDV) 91 and mouse (epizootic diarrhea of infant mice-EDIM). 105 Other species which develop enteritis caused by reovirus-like agents include the pig 10 H and the lamb. 107 Infection is most common during the neonatal period. 10;, 1os",

These findings were confirmed and expanded by Kapikian and co-workers, 38 \u00b7 92 who showed an antigenic relationship between the human agent (HRVL), NCDV, and the virus ofEDIM by using CF tests. 38 \u00b7 92 Additional CF tests failed to demonstrate any immunological relationship between the HRVL and known reoviruses or 20 standard orbiviruses, groups of viruses with a similar morphological appearance. 38 \u2022 92 Antisera to the three known types of reovirus also do not bind to HRVL in intestinal tissue using immunofluorescent antibody techniques. 84 The NCDV has recently been propagated successfully in tissue culture. 108 \u2022 112 As a result, a vaccine has been developed to combat this disease. Immunity to NCDV develops in newborn calves in 2 days after oral inoculation with the vaccine, before the development of significant serum antibody levels, which suggests an immune protection at the intestinal mucosal level. 113 Field studies in newborn calves have also shown that the presence of passively acquired antibody of maternal origin is not sufficient to protect calves from clinical NCDV illness. 113 Coronauiruses. In addition to the reovirus-like agent of piglets there is a corona virus which causes transmissible gastroenteritis of swine by infecting the small intestine 114 of neonatal piglets. 11 \" Protection is afforded by the presence of a specific anticoronavirus IgA antibody in the milk of the mother. 116 \u2022 117 In infected piglets with diarrhea, there is net intraluminal secretion of water and electrolytes in the proximal jejunum which is associated with increased active and passive sodium efflux. Intestinal mucosal adenyl cyclase levels are normal, but sodium-potassium adenosinetriphosphatase levels are decreased in infected animals. 118 \u00b7 119 The rate of cell migration from crypts to villus tips is increased and the crypts are hyperplastic. 11 8 \u2022 1 w It has been suggested that impaired intestinal epithelial maturation may contribute to the observed secretory diarrhea. 11 !J Future Investigations Although progress has been made recently in defining the clinical features, the histopathology and some aspects of the pathophysiology of viral gastroenteritis, much remains to be learned.",
