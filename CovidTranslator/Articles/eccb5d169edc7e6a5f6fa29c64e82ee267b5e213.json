The sample-to-sample variations of these titers typically deviated by only \u00b11 titer dilution in samples under repeated runs.

Similar to the IgG titers, the vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody levels were quite stable after single or multiple vaccinations for up to 88 years ( Figure 2 ). In the majority of examined samples (124/209, 59%), the NT 50 ranged from 1:256 to 1:512 (Ln 5.55-6.24) and remained stable. Only 3 patients (1.4%) had no measurable neutralizing antibody. Of note, and in contrast to the ELISA findings, there was no significant difference in neutralizing antibody level in those vaccinated once compared with those receiving additional vaccines ( Figure 2 ). Control non-vaccinated subjects reproducibly yielded NT 50 titers of <1:16 (Ln <2.77), with the majority of samples reproducibly measuring below 1:8 (Ln 2.08). We also assessed the stability of sequential measurements of neutralizing antibody among the 62 subjects who had received only a single vaccination. The median line through the values obtained on these subjects had a small negative slope (\u22120.0003/year) (data not shown), suggesting that even individuals who have had only a single vaccination maintain protective levels of neutralizing antibody indefinitely.",

Frey et al 31 have shown that 1:10 dilutions of the vaccine also are highly efficient at eliciting clinical takes in previously unvaccinated individuals. Our revealed that nearly all the individuals who have been vaccinated one or more times maintained antivaccinia IgG and neutralizing antibody titers above 3 natural logs indefinitely. Titers were stable for up to 88 years. Moreover, those who survived active smallpox infections in their youth retained vaccinia-specific immunity throughout their lives and their antivaccinia antibody titers were similar to the levels of vaccinated subjects. Thus, vaccinated subjects remain immune to vaccinia indefinitely and do not require booster vaccinations even if they are many decades removed from primary vaccination. These data imply that limited supplies of vaccine can be more usefully applied (perhaps in diluted form) to individuals who have never been vaccinated, primarily individuals born after 1972.",

Vaccinia-specific IgG (A) and neutralization (B) titers in participants with previous smallpox diagnosis were not significantly different from titers in participants with single or multiple vaccinations.

Using species-specifire antihuman conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), the colorimetric response was assessed on an ELISA plate reader at wavelenths 340 and 492 nm. Antibody titers were determined by logarithmic transformation of the linear portion of the curve, with 0.025-0.030 optical density units used as the endpoint to convert the final values. The coefficient of variation of repeated samples ranged from 2.3% to 5.4%. Specificity and background controls were performed with each assay and plate run. A vaccinia immunoglobulin (VIG) reference standard, generously donated by Dorothy Scott (CBER/FDA), was used as a positive control. This standard demonstrated reproducible IgG titers of 1:20,480-40,960 by ELISA, comparable to the VIG vial concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL. The mean antibody titer of serum samples from nonvaccinated individuals was <1:4.",
