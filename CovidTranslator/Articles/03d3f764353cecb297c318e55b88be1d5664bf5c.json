            "text": "The devastation caused by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has brought to the fore a number of important ethical debates about how best to respond to a health crisis. These debates include issues related to prevention and containment, management of the health care workforce, clinical care, and research design, all of which are situated within the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens of EVD-affected countries to respond to a disease outbreak. Ethical issues related to prevention and containment include the appropriateness and scope of quarantine and isolation within and outside affected countries. The possibility of infection in health care workers impelled consideration of whether there is an obligation to provide health services where personal protection equipment is inadequate, alongside the issue of whether the health care workforce should have special access to experimental treatment and care interventions under development. In clinical care, ethical issues include the standards of care owed to people who comply with quarantine and isolation restrictions. Ethical issues in research include appropriate study design related to experimental vaccines and treatment interventions, and the sharing of data and biospecimens between research groups. The compassionate use of experimental drugs intersects both with research ethics and clinical care. The role of developed countries also came under scrutiny, and we concluded that developed countries have an obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by contributing to the strengthening of local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities engaged in research, ensuring that affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions developed, and supporting affected countries on their way to recovery from the impact of EVD on their social and economic lives.",

This is the first time an EVD outbreak has occurred in West Africa although EVD outbreaks in Africa have been documented since 1976. This outbreak is unique in its size, duration, and spatial extent. 1 It has generated intense debates on appropriate international responses to infectious disease emergencies, the processes of researching new treatments and vaccines during an epidemic outbreak, and standards for prevention and care. These debates have also focused national and international attention on disparities in health care standards between developed and developing countries, on differing applications of ethical standards governing the right to health between developed and developing countries arising from these disparities, and the ethical responsibilities of various agencies in the current and future infectious disease outbreaks.",

Our analysis is based on a reflection of the social-ecological model widely used in health behavior research and practice to assess the multiple levels that influence a health issue. More specifically, this model is unique because it allows the researcher or practitioner to identify the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy factors that contribute to a particular health issue or event so that health professionals and/or researchers may identify the best intervention or research methods. Therefore, we will detail the ethical issues that impact the Ebola epidemic from a social-ecological model analysis.",

            "text": "The West African EVD epidemic resulted in the death of five times as many people as every other known EVD outbreak combined. 2 It is also the largest ever emergency operation in the 70 year history of the World Health Organization (WHO). 3 Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea bore the brunt of the epidemic, though cases were also reported in Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, the United States, and Spain. Only three infections occurred outside West Africa (two in the US and one in Spain). At the time of the EVD epidemic in West Africa, another EVD epidemic caused by an unrelated EVD strain occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2014, with 66 cases and 49 deaths. This was contained, and the country has remained EVD free since November 2014. The West African region had been on the brink of being declared EVD-free several times but for instances of new case identification in Sierra Leone 4 and Liberia. 5 The region was finally declared EVD free on January 14, 2016. 6 There are, however, potentials for multiple flare-ups in the region as some survivors could sexually transmit infection. 7, 8 The West Africa epidemic was different in many respects to past EVD epidemics. First, it is the largest and longest EVD outbreak in history, 3 involving several developed and developing countries. Fears of cross-border transmission resulted in over 50 countries around the world issuing travel restrictions to and from EVD-affected countries. 9 Second, the epidemic garnered international support, including significant investment in the research and development of vaccines 10 and therapies 11, 12 for EVD infection, although the response was slow and arguably inadequate. 13, 14 Third, it stimulated debates at many international, regional, and national fora about compassionate access to experimental regimens for therapy during epidemics and alternative clinical trial designs to test the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines and therapies. The debates resulted in guidelines being developed, 15 and considerations for revised ethical guidance on clinical trial design and sharing of biospecimens and data. 16 Actions are also being taken to institute structural measures for improved emergency response capacities around the world. 3 One of the ethical debates was the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone to proactively exercise their right to health under normal conditions, let alone when their countries were in the grip of an epidemic. 17 Of note, Liberia had 51 doctors for its population of 4.3 million people. 18 The drastically under-resourced health care structures and systems in these countries constitute moral problems in themselves and both heighten and complicate the other ethical issues that arose in relation to the epidemic. Accordingly, we reviewed the literature and discuss ethical considerations in the West African EVD outbreak from a perspective that is grounded in a critique of the social and structural elements that contributed to the deprivation of the individuals and communities that bore the brunt of the epidemic. These include ethical analysis of public health measures such as quarantine, isolation, protection of health care workers, and travel restrictions. We also analyzed the debates that had taken place regarding research ethics, including the conduct of research during public health emergencies, the ethics of randomization, standards of care both within and outside research studies, and the sharing of biospecimens and related data internationally. Finally we considered the ethical issues surrounding the topic of EVD survivors.",

Also, the civil distrust of and misgivings toward the government, due to long years of neglect of health services and systems, slowed down the public response. 18, 20, 21 At the time of the outbreak, many international donor agencies that had handled past emergency health problems were establishing fledgling transitional systems intended to reduce donor dependence in the region and were therefore not operating at maximum potential. [22] [23] [24] [25] Also, individuals had grown to depend on alternative health care providers in view of the dilapidated health care structures and systems. 25 Thus, the initial calls by the government to take precautions against EVD infection were treated with levity. The disease was unknown in the region, and the public health messages stigmatized cherished traditional practices as \"risky behaviors\", arising from the logical clinical and epidemiological framings of contagion. 26 For example, the cultural practice of burial rites, which were designed as a means of parting with the dead through a show of dignity and respect, were now labeled \"bad\", and people were requested to make immediate and extensive changes in their core practices and ways of relating and interacting to curb EVD spread. 26 Also, the sudden urgent need for clean water for regular hand washing brought with it its own challenges as access to regular clean water was limited. 27 Public myths and misconceptions soon grew from the government actions, with many believing that the government was merely interested in sourcing for new foreign aid for further personal enrichment. 28 With increasing cases of EVD infection, poor standards of care in health facilities, 29, 30 high case fatality, 31 and large numbers of people turned back from treatment centers, 32 many individuals also had to become personally responsible for their individual care. Care of the sick at home became the backup for managing many cases, 33, 34 and in such situations, individuals had to learn to provide care for infected and affected loved ones while ensuring personal protection.",

            "text": "Quarantine helps to contain new infections during an infectious disease outbreak. 35 One of the criticisms of the initial outbreak response was that the quarantine was poorly managed. Koch 35 and Barbisch et al 36 argue that quarantine of whole communities could be ethically justified, particularly if the containment area included the entire area within which individuals from a community would usually travel. Koch 35 describes this as a spatial focus for quarantine rather than one focused on a targeted population. It allows for better concentration on humanitarian medicine for the infected, as far greater concentration of resources would be available for a smaller pool of infected people. A call for \"spatial\" quarantine for EVD containment may be at odds with the \"principle of least infringement\", an ethical principle applied in public health contexts to curtail the use of liberty-restricting interventions to the least restrictive action required to meet a public health goal. But when the public health goal is containment of an infectious disease to meet the dual goals of enabling the best possible care for the sick within the quarantine zone, as well as to reduce the spread of infection, such a measure could be ethically justified. Restrictions should therefore be done in a way that is relevant, legitimate, and necessary, and stakeholders should be fully informed about the risks and benefits, especially as they affects their health, well-being, and personal liberty. 37 Those quarantined should also not suffer unfair economic penalties. 37 The tension between quarantine as a public health measure and individual rights to privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement is well recognized, and the need to strike a balance between the utilitarian aim of promoting public health, on the one hand, and libertarian aims of protecting privacy and freedom of movement on the other hand, have been widely discussed. [37] [38] [39] There is a reasonable expectation that when people are asked to surrender their liberty through quarantine, there is a reciprocal obligation to provide adequate care for individuals who have complied. When such care is not forthcoming or when it is inadequate, it can be argued that the individual, who is legally required to report for quarantine, does not have a moral obligation to do so.",

            "text": "The EVD outbreak catalyzed a flurry of scientific activity to consider investigational compounds under development and to hasten their pathway into human trials. In 2014, the Ethics Advisory Committee to the WHO met and issued a statement that supported the use of unregistered interventions in the EVD epidemic. 15 This gave credence both to EVD research efforts and to compassionate use of unproven agents. There were intense debates about the appropriate design and conduct of EVD vaccine and drug trials. Much of this debate centered on the ethics of randomization in the midst of an epidemic with high case fatality. [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] Those in favor of randomized clinical trial argued that EVD clinical trials present a situation of genuine uncertainty, and therefore justified randomization to experimental treatment versus placebo. [72] [73] [74] Also, drug registration for licensure would require data generated through randomized clinical trials. 70, 71 Those in favor of alternative trial designs 67,68,75-78 noted that ethical standards guiding therapeutic research should be flexible enough to give the dying \"a chance at rescue\". 78 Also, alternative research designs facilitated access of persons to experimental products to reduce the risk of fatality, especially with promising experimental products. 67, 78, 79 The Ebola ca Suffit trial provided evidence on the suitability of an alternative vaccine trial design to generate evidence on the effectiveness of a vaccine. 80 Ethical dilemmas informing policy response to the epidemic Within a public health emergency, values defined by public health ethics -an overriding priority afforded to \"greater good\" considerations 57,81 -should take precedence over individual concerns, according to ethicist Dawson. 82 Dawson was particularly concerned that the WHO Advisory Panel meeting held in September 2014 83 focused on \"individualistic\" values -the use of unregistered interventions for clinical care or prevention -rather than on the \"old fashioned public health methods\" such as quarantine, contact tracing, and social distancing. 82 In response, Haire and Folayan 79 argued that access to treatment, whether experimental or not, should not be separated from \"public health ethics\", given that community support for and compliance with public health containment measures requires some reciprocity. Also, some hope of an effective treatment, however remote, could assist individuals and communities in accepting otherwise unwelcome public health measures.",

This proposal is in line with the principles enshrined in the 2011 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework 90 and respects the principle of reciprocity. 91",

Extensive donor investment in the EVD response also has implications for funding of other research in the region as research funds were moved away from other disease areas to address the EVD emergency response needs. 99 The instituted infection control measures also affected social interactions, although the scope of impact of EVD epidemic on the social dynamic of affected countries remains largely unknown and would be difficult to measure because pre-epidemic data are rarely available due to the unpredictable nature of disease outbreaks. However, it is known that infectious diseases have severe impact on biodiversity. [100] [101] [102] The WHO's report on lessons learned from the 2014 EVD outbreak in West Africa 3 identified four big lessons all related to the structural interventions provided during the epidemic. The report failed to recognize the immense changes in the dynamics of life and livelihood of affected individuals, communities, and the country and the need to support affected countries on their way back from recovering from the social, environmental, cultural, and economic tolls of the epidemic. Such support would involve long-term commitment from international partners and donors. Unfortunately, the outcomes of such long-term support are difficult to measure.

The privacy-limiting nature of name-reporting associated with the operations of surveillance systems to monitor EVD requires that the public be educated about this measure and consulted on how best to undertake contact tracing. EVD survivors should also be consulted about how best to institute surveillance and contact tracing systems that reduce the risk for stigma. 39 Social interventions at the community level include galvanizing support for members of the extended families who have adopted children orphaned by EVD. 109 The possibility of supporting prompt adoption of orphaned children by qualified persons should also be explored. International support programs or projects should not seek to subsume these community practices of orphaned and vulnerable chil-dren's support with attractive alternatives. Rather, safe local practices of child care should be promoted. 110 Ethical obligation for EVD response at the country level At the country level, it is the ethical obligation of governments and appropriate authorities to ensure that hospitals maintain resources and adequate health care professionals to isolate and treat new patients with EVD. With depleted numbers of experienced health care workers in EVD-affected countries resulting from the high case fatality rate (as high as 59%), 111 affected countries will need regional and international support to augment health care delivery for citizens beyond providing support for those infected with EVD. The global community needs to continue to support medical personnel to travel to affected countries to help provide medical care for the short and medium term while the country makes effort to train more medical staff. There have been such past practices between national governments through North-South Collaborations and South-South Collaborations. 112 Public policies on management and control of epidemiccausing infectious diseases in general, and EVD management and control specifically, need to be developed. For example, in the wake of the EVD outbreak in Nigeria, the national research ethics code was revised to allow for country access and use of experimental drugs on compassionate grounds for the management of EVD. The absence of this policy was a disincentive for the use of experimental drugs for Dr Sheik Humarr Khan in Sierra Leone. 113 Public health policies in developing countries would also need to be revised to address the obligations of health care personnel to work in the time of an infectious disease outbreak. Policies that can guide the scientific and ethical conduct of research at the time of a national emergency would also be helpful and a welcome development. Policies on isolation of infected persons and quarantine of affected persons need to be based on robust legal and ethical justification. For EVD, where the probability of transmission and severity of harm justifies the need to restrict movements of people for public health purposes, consultation and communication with affected communities on \"why\" and \"how\" to implement measures is an ethical imperative. The options for practicing quarantine and isolation should not create divides between social classes and result in unjust treatment of the poor, such as creating food insecurity. 38, 39 Resources should also be committed to providing support for those who lose income through isolation and quarantine, as equity requires that those who ",

The EVD outbreak dem-onstrated the magnitude of what can be achieved within a short time with global solidarity. We live in a time of fluid borders brought on by ease of travel, technological innovations, and an aggressive global media. This denies us the intellectual luxury of viewing global issues such as HIV infection, global warming, and, now, EVD from the narrow lens of a domestic crisis. It is a global crisis with impact at the individual, community, national, and international levels associated with ethical responsibilities for individuals, collectives, governments, and donor agencies.",
