Of all the participants in this symposium I have the distinction of having had no first-hand experience with SARS. Nevertheless, I do have some credentials. In March of 2003 I travelled to and through Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taipei, Seoul and Narita and realised on my trip back to Los Angeles on March 17 th that I needed a chapter on SARS for the 5 th edition of our book 'Textbook of Pediatric Infectious Diseases' which was soon to be published. So, with the help of four Hong Kong colleagues this chapter was written in under 2 weeks and is the most complete reference to date relating to paediatrics. 1 SARS was apparently a new human disease which first occurred in Southern China in the autumn of 2002 and spread to 29 countries or regions with a total of 8096 cases and 774 deaths. [1] [2] [3] The aetiologic agent of SARS (a previously unrecognised coronavirus; SARS-CoV) was isolated and its genome sequenced in record time. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Following an incredible global public health effort, the mini pandemic was brought under control within 7 months of its initial occurrence. 9 The overall effort demonstrated unprecedented international cooperation and this was facilitated by electronic transmission of information. In general, worldwide media coverage was unusually accurate and provided pictures to augment scientific data.",

He was hospitalised and treated in an intensive care unit. He recovered but his wife, aunt, and aunt's daughter all became ill. 14 [15] [16] [17] [18] Viral particles were seen on electron microscopic examination of swabs and sputum specimens from SARS patients. The SARS virus grew in Vero cell and fetal rhesus kidney cell tissue cultures. Cytopathic effect was noted in the Vero cell cultures in 5 to 6 days and in the fetal rhesus kidney cell cultures in 2 to 4 days. 16, 17 This virus, which was a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was rapidly identified using both conventional virologic methods and cutting edge molecular biology. The genome was completely and rapidly sequenced in several laboratories. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] This was a significant accomplishment when one realises that coronaviruses have the largest genomes (30 000 bases of positivestrand RNA) found in any RNA virus. Sequence data allowed the rapid development of highly specific diagnostic tests and also helped in the epidemiologic study of the mini pandemic.",

However, clinical judgment may allow a small proportion of patients without a documented fever to meet this criterion.

However, both are less sensitive for detecting infection early in illness. The majority of patients in the early stages of SARS-CoV disease have a low titre of virus in respiratory and other secretions and require time to mount an antibody response.

It first occurred in Southern China in November 2002 and was transported to Hong Kong on February 21, 2003 by an infected and ill patient. Ten secondary cases spread the infection to two hospitals in Hong Kong and to Singapore, Toronto and Hanoi. In March 2003 a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was found to be the causative agent. Within 11 weeks from the first SARS case in Hong Kong it had spread to an additional 27 countries or special administrative regions. The mini pandemic peaked during the last week of May 2003 and the last new probable case was on July 13, 2003. There were a total of 8096 probable cases and 774 deaths. Sixty-six per cent of the cases occurred in China, 22% in Hong Kong, 4% in Taiwan and 3% in both Singapore and Canada.

This involved a 64-year-old physician from Zhongshan University in Guangdong Province who travelled to Hong Kong to attend a wedding. Prior to his hospitalisation in Hong Kong he stayed in the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong for 1 day. Subsequently, 10 secondary cases occurred in other hotel guests and these infected and ill persons led directly to tertiary cases in two Hong Kong hospitals and outbreaks in Singapore, Toronto and Hanoi. 15 Using classical virologic methods, the causative viral agent of SARS was identified in three laboratories in mid March 2003.",

This March 17 th report included 5 countries, with cases linked to Hong Kong and the Metropole Hotel. It also includes two suspect or probable cases in Switzerland. Over the next several days the case counts in Switzerland varied between zero and seven but a subsequent study indicated only one case with no subsequent transmission. By March 24, 2003 there were 761 cases in 15 countries or special administrative regions. New countries at this time were France, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In France the total cases reached seven, all of whom were imported with no local transmission within the country. In Italy the total number of cases reached four and all were imported. In Ireland there was one accepted case and, as noted above, this case had a link to the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong. Throughout this reporting period there was one case in Spain, four cases in the United Kingdom and 27 cases in the United States, all cases in these three countries were imported. In Taiwan there were six cases noted on March 24, 2003 and there had been evidence of local transmission. The first case in Taiwan occurred on February 25 and the last probably case occurred on June 15, 2003. A total of 697 cases were reported in Taiwan at the peak of the epidemic but almost half were later excluded. In Taiwan the total number of imported cases was only 21 and the vast majority were the result of local transmission. An addition to the effected countries on March 31, 2003 was Romania. Initially three cases were noted but the final count was one imported case with no further transmission. New countries on April 7, 2003 were Australia, Brazil and Malaysia. Of these countries Australia and Malaysia had six and five imported cases respectively, and Brazil was later removed from the list. New countries on April 14, 2003 included Indonesia, Kuwait, the Philippines, South Africa and Sweden. Of these countries, local secondary transmission occurred only in the Philippines. Seven of the 14 cases were importations. New countries as of April 21, 2003",
