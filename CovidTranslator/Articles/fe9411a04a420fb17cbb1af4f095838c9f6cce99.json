We set out to determine the threedimensional structure of the soluble ectodomain of this type-I transmembrane protein by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The fold of the protein is the first member of a further variation of the immunoglobulin like beta-sandwich fold. Because X4 does not reveal significant sequence homologies to proteins in the data bases, we carried out a structure based similarity search for proteins with known function. High structural similarity to Dl domains of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, and common features in amino acid sequence between X4 and ICAM-1, suggest X4 to possess binding activity for the a L integrin I domain of LFA-1. Further, based on this structure based prediction, potential functions of X4 in virus replication and pathogenesis are discussed.",

The viral genome is almost 30 kb in length and contains at least 11 open reading frames, whereas the exact number depends on the strain and the minimal count of coded amino acid residues [1] [2] [3] . Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses that code for the characteristic proteins replicase (R), spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In addition, SARS-CoV codes for subgroup-specific accessory proteins that are thought to be dispensable for viral replication in cell culture, but may be important for virus-host interactions and thus contribute to the virus' fitness. The important roles of these so-called ''accessory'' proteins for viral infectivity, replication efficiency and pathogenic effects is well established and investigated e.g. for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) accessory proteins [4, 5] , and for Rhinoviruses [6] .",

ORF8 was suggested to encode a predicted protein of 122 amino acids that has no significant BLAST or FASTA matches to known proteins [2] . X4 is predicted to contain a transmembrane helix comprising residues 99-117. The predicted signal sequence is probably cleaved off between residues 15 and 16.

Lower and upper bounds for distance constraints were derived from the target distances empirically by estimation of the error as 12.5% of the target distance squared. Distances involving ambiguous constraints, methyl groups, aromatic ring protons and nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons were treated as sum of separate contributions to the target function, known as ''sum averaging'' [17] .

The prototype fold is called ctype with strands A, B, E, and D forming one sheet and strands C, F, and G forming the other sheet ( Figure 4) . A variant, called s-type has a topology with strand D being switched from the ABED sheet to the CFG sheet. This strand is then called C. X4e is a variation of the c-type with the A strand being attached to the CFG sheet. Although, it was already suggested more than 10 years ago to introduce a new subtype for such a topology within the Ig like folds [23] , X4e is to our knowledge the first pure member of that subtype of Ig-like folds.

Examples are the Dl domains of intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 [24] and ICAM-2 [25] . Dl and D2 domains of the IL-1 receptor exhibit a completely switched strand A. Both domains contain, in contrast to X4e, short C\u00a2 strands and were classified as ''c-type'' [26] . In addition, numerous ''v-type'' Ig-like folds are known with a ninestranded beta-sandwich (ABED and GFCC\u00a2C\u00a2\u00a2 where the A strand is completely switched from the BED sheet to the GFCC\u00a2C\u00a2\u00a2 sheet ( Figure 4) . At the top of the BED sheet, the DE loop is protruding from the structure and together with beta-strands C and D delineates a groove on the surface of X4 (Figure 2c ). Central to the groove is the sidechain-carboxyl group of residue Glu 18, contributing a negative charge to the bottom of the otherwise hydrophobic groove. Such a hydrophobic patch on the molecule surface with a central negative electrostatic potential may form a potential site for ligand interaction.",

But based on this structural similarity and the described common features of amino acid sequence and surface appearance of X4 with the well characterized a L integrin I domain binding site on ICAM-1 D1, we suggest that X4 contains a binding site for the a L integrin subunit I-domain of LFA-1. Although, experimental data will be needed to confirm the prediction, we carried out a modelling study on X4 and the a L integrin subunit I-domain of LFA-1. Interestingly, the resulting complex did not show obvious steric problems to be formed (Figure 7) .",

Prominent examples of viral accessory proteins with such functions are known from other viruses, e.g. HIV-1 Vpu binds to CD4 and prevents CD4 delivery to the cell surface and induces even its degradation [38, 39] . LFA-1 is exclusively expressed on the surface of leukocytes including T cells and dendritic cells. It mediates several adhesive interactions between cells of the immune system, e.g. dendritic cells and T cells, B cells and T cells, T cells and their target cells, as well as the interactions of leukocytes with the endothelium and the transendothelial migration of leukocytes [40] . Loss of LFA-1 leads to severe defects of the immune system as can be seen in the leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) syndrome [41] .",
