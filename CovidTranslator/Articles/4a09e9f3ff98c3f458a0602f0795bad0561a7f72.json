            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an enteric coronaviral infection that causes severe morbidity and mortality in suckling pigs, but less severe disease in older pigs. Consequently, it causes significant economic losses to the pork industry. There are limited studies on the innate immune responses to PED virus (PEDV) in pigs. The aims of our study were to investigate differences in innate immune responses to PEDV infection in suckling and weaned pigs and to examine if disease severity coincides with reduced innate immune responses. Weaned 26-day-old pigs (n = 20) and 9-day-old nursing pigs (n = 20) were assigned to PEDV inoculated or uninoculated control groups. The pigs were observed daily for clinical signs, virus shedding and were euthanized at post-inoculation days (PIDs) 1 and 5 to assay immune responses. Blood samples were collected at PIDs 1, 3 and 5. The natural killer (NK) cell frequencies, NK cell activities (lysis of target K562 tumor cells in vitro), CD3+CD4+ T cell and CD3+CD8+ T cell frequencies were measured in blood and ileum at PIDs 1 and 5. The PEDV infected suckling pigs showed severe diarrhea and vomiting at PID 1, whereas the PEDV infected weaned pigs showed milder clinical signs starting at PID 3. PEDV infected suckling pigs had significantly higher diarrhea scores, earlier fecal PEDV RNA shedding and significantly higher viremia (viral RNA in serum) compared to weaned pigs. There was no mortality in either infected suckling or infected weaned pigs. The control pigs not inoculated with PEDV did not show any clinical signs and no detectable fecal or serum PEDV RNA. Strikingly, PEDV infected suckling pigs had significantly lower NK cell frequencies, undetectable NK cell activity and lower IFN\u2425 producing NK cells in blood and ileum compared to PEDV infected weaned pigs. Pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles of PEDV infected suckling pigs differed from those of PEDV infected weaned pigs and coincided with onset of fecal PEDV RNA shedding and serum PEDV RNA titers. The infected suckling pigs have higher and earlier increases in serum IFN\u2423, but lower serum IL-8 and TNF\u2423 levels compared to infected weaned pigs. CD3+CD4+ T cell frequencies were significantly higher in ileum of suckling pigs than in weaned pigs, whereas there was no difference in CD3+CD8+ T cell frequencies. In conclusion, the observations of impaired lytic activity and IFN-\u2425 production by NK cells in suckling pigs coincided with the increased severity of PEDV infection in the suckling pigs compared with the weaned pigs.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric coronavirus (genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) causing significant morbidity and mortality in suckling pigs. PEDV was first diagnosed in the USA in May, 2013 (Stevenson et al., 2013) and has spread throughout the USA and was also reported in Mexico and Canada (Vlasova et al., 2014) . The estimated annual economic losses in the US from PEDV is $900 million to $1.8 billion (Paarlberg, 2014) . PEDV causes severe enteric disease in suckling pigs (Chen et al., 2014; Stevenson et al., 2013) , but milder disease in older weaned pigs . This is similar to earlier observations for another enteric coronavirus infection of pigs, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) (Saif et al., 1994) . Therefore, similar to TGE virus (TGEV) infection, biofeedback of intestinal contents of affected pigs to older pigs to build herd immunity is considered as an important method to reduce losses from PEDV (Jung and Saif, 2015) . Viral infections induce both innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity involves production of cytokines and interferons as well as recruitment of innate immune cells such as http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.09.006 0165-2427/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells (Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010) . The innate immune response plays a significant role in controlling primary viral infections and in development of adaptive immune responses (Aoshi et al., 2011; Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002) . NK cells are innate immune cells that display cytotoxic action against virus infected host cells and tumor cells (Campbell and Hasegawa, 2013; Herberman et al., 1975; Trinchieri, 1989) and thus play an important initial role in containing the viral infection. NK cells are also a major source of certain cytokines such as IFN\u2425 and TNF\u2423 (Fauriat et al., 2010; Vivier et al., 2008) . They play a key role in initial clearance of infection in viral diseases (Brandstadter and Yang, 2011) .",

            "text": "Cytokines are important in viral infections in that they are necessary for cell to cell communication for inflammation and immune responses (Akira and Kishimoto, 1992) . The early cytokines secreted during a viral infection help to modulate immune responses. The cytokines examined in this study are early cytokines that have mainly proinflammatory and antiviral action. Interferons are a group of cytokines whose major function is antiviral activity (Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957; Wheelock, 1965) . IFN\u2423 is a type I interferon produced by most cells in response to viral infection, with the major source being innate immune cells such as monocytes and dendritic cells (Trinchieri et al., 1978) . IFN\u2425 is a type II interferon produced initially by innate immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells, and later on by activated T cells (Sen, 2001) . IFN\u2425 is important in enhancing the activities of phagocytic cells such as macrophages and NK cells (Carnaud et al., 1999) . IL-8 is produced by various cell types and is a proinflammatory cytokine due to its chemoattractive properties for inflammatory cells (Arndt et al., 1996; Huber et al., 1991) . IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by Th17 cells, as well as \u2425\u2426T cells (innate immune cells in mucosa) (Jin and Dong, 2013) . It stimulates the inflammatory response to viral infections (Ryzhakov et al., 2011) . IL-12 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced mainly by phagocytic cells and is involved in activation of NK cell activity including IFN\u2425 production by NK cells (Trinchieri, 1995) . TNF\u2423 is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted mainly by macrophages that regulates cell death, differentiation and inflammation (Bradley, 2008) . Studies of rotavirus infection of children showed that the cytokine responses varied depending on severity of clinical signs in individuals (Jiang et al., 2003) . Studies of human rotavirus infected gnotobiotic pigs showed similarly that the proinflammatory cytokine responses were more marked with virulent virus compared with attenuated virus infection (Azevedo et al., 2006) . The above cytokines were examined in the present study to understand if differences in proinflammatory cytokine responses between suckling and weaned pigs may be involved in susceptibility of suckling pigs to severe disease by PEDV infection.",

The SPF OSU herd was also seronegative for antibodies to porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, PRCV, TGEV and porcine circovirus type 2. The sows farrowed naturally and nursed their piglets until the end of the study. The four experimental groups in the study were as follows. Group 1: PEDV inoculated 9-day-old suckling pigs (n = 9); Group 2: MEM only inoculated 9-day-old suckling pigs (n = 11); Group 3: PEDV inoculated 26day-old weaned pigs (n = 11); Group 4: MEM only inoculated 26-day-old weaned pigs (n = 9). All experimental procedures on animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University. Pigs in PEDV groups were inoculated orally with PEDV inoculum [8.9 log 10 GE (genomic equivalents) (\u22482.9 log 10 plaque forming unit)/pig] and pigs in MEM only inoculated groups received MEM. The inoculation dose was based on a previous pathogenicity study in our lab (Jung et al., 2014) . Following PEDV inoculation, pigs were monitored for clinical signs daily until necropsy. Diarrhea was assessed by scoring fecal consistency. Fecal consistency was scored as, 0 = solid; 1 = pasty; 2 = semi-liquid; 3 = liquid, with scores of 2 or more considered diarrheic. Inoculated and mock pigs (n = 3-4/group at each time-point) were euthanized for immunological studies at an acute stage on post inoculation day (PID) 1 and at a later stage (PID 5) of infection. Blood samples were taken at PID 1 (n = 6-8 pigs per group), PID 3 (n = 4-8 pigs per group) and PID 5 (from euthanized pigs, n = 3-4 per group) and separate serum aliquots were prepared for cytokine analysis and viral RNA quantification.",

Therefore, viral RNA titers more than 4.8 log10 GE/ml in rectal swab fluid or 3.8 GE/ml in serum are considered positive.

In infected suckling and weaned groups, peak IFN\u2423, IL-12 and TNF\u2423 levels coincided with onset of diarrhea and fecal PEDV RNA shedding and peak serum PEDV RNA titers (PIDs 1 and 3, respectively); and (4) Frequencies of CD3+CD4+ T cells were significantly higher in ileum of suckling pigs than in weaned pigs, whereas there was no difference in frequency of CD3+CD8+ T cells.

In general, neonates of various species are more susceptible to severe disease than adults (Camacho-Gonzalez et al., 2013; Rose, 1983; Rosenberg et al., 1981; Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010; Wohlfender et al., 2009 ). One of the reasons for the high susceptibility of neonates to severe disease from infections is deficient innate and adaptive immune responses/memory (Levy, 2007; Levy et al., 1999) . In the absence of previous exposure to pathogens, and therefore no adaptive immune responses, the newborn depends on innate immune responses to clear or reduce viral infection. In instances when the virus infection overwhelms the already weak innate immunity of the neonate, severe disease results (Firth et al., 2005) . The virus levels in blood were directly related to severity of certain enteroviral diseases in infants (Dagan et al., 1985; Yen et al., 2007) as well as in other viral infections (Maggi et al., 2003; Vaughn et al., 2000) . Interestingly in the present study, the moderate titer of PEDV RNA in serum of suckling pigs and 100-fold lower titers in weaned pigs coincided with the greater severity of disease in suckling pigs compared to weaned pigs. The severity of disease in suckling pigs also coincided with the early high titer PEDV RNA fecal shedding.",

Suckling pigs had no detectable NK cell activity in blood or ileal MNCs and the activity did not change with infection, although the suckling pigs had comparable NK cell frequencies in most instances (except PIDs of infected pigs) to weaned pigs. This is in confirmation of previous studies of NK cell frequency and cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes of healthy suckling pigs against K562 cells (Onizuka et al., 1987; Yang et al., 1987) . Newborn pigs also did not have NK cell mediated cytotoxic activity against PK-15 cells persistently infected with TGEV (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984) . Studies of TGE showed that vaccination with a modified live TGEV vaccine did not increase NK cell activity in newborn pigs (Raymond and Wilkie, 1998) , but in vitro stimulation of adult monocytes increased NK cell activity (Charley et al., 1983) . In the present study, PEDV infected weaned pigs showed increased frequencies as well as activity of NK cells in the ileum. Although uninfected suckling pigs had comparable NK cell frequencies to weaned pigs, their frequencies were reduced in blood and slightly increased in ileum following infection, but NK cell activity remained undetectable. Studies of human infants showed that neonates had significantly lower NK cell lytic activity and the activity was further reduced by infection or sepsis (Georgeson et al., 2001; Uksila et al., 1982) . NK cells of infants also had reduced antiviral activity such as defective killing of virus infected cells and reduced cytokine secretion (Jacobson et al., 2013) . Collectively, reduced NK cell activity and NK cell frequencies may have contributed to the early onset of virus shedding and the severe clinical signs in the suckling versus weaned pigs.",

Further, PEDV infection reduced the frequencies of IFN\u2425 producing NK cells in ileum of suckling pigs. Neonatal MNCs are deficient in IFN\u2425 production in response to antigenic stimuli (Wilson et al., 1986) . NK cells are the major source of IFN\u2425 and activation of NK cells by IFN\u2425 is essential for their lytic activity (Wang et al., 2012) . Studies have shown that the increase in frequency, activity of NK cells and IFN\u2425 production by NK cells is essential for reduction of viral load in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or influenza virus (Biron et al., 1983; Mack et al., 2011; Stein-Streilein et al., 1988) . Further, production of IFN\u2424 and IFN\u2425 in intestine of mice was essential and sufficient to induce innate immune cells to eliminate certain bacterial pathogens in mice (Sotolongo et al., 2011) . Since the suckling pigs showed reduced IFN\u2425 positive NK cell frequencies, this could result in reduced viral clearance contributing to the enhanced disease. Similar to our observations, foot and mouth disease virus decreased the lytic activity of NK cells in swine (Toka et al., 2009) . Studies showed that IL-18 production stimulates IFN\u2425 production and IL-18 production is less in intestinal epithelium of neonatal pigs compared to older pigs (Muneta et al., 2002) . Thus, it appears that the failure to induce sufficient IFN\u2425 production by NK cells might be one reason for increased severity of disease and higher systemic load of PEDV in suckling pigs.",

            "text": "The weaned pigs had a delayed pro-inflammatory cytokine induction compared with suckling pigs which coincided with delayed infection, disease and shedding of PEDV RNA in feces of weaned pigs. IFN\u2423 is an antiviral cytokine produced in response to viral infection by monocytes and dendritic cells (Hansmann et al., 2008; Siegal et al., 1999) . Consistent with fecal virus shedding and serum viral RNA titers, the suckling pigs had the highest serum IFN\u2423 induction at PID 1. The higher systemic IFN\u2423 response in suckling pigs at the early stage of infection coincides with the serum PEDV RNA titer and very severe infection. Collectively, lack of NK cell activity, reduced NK cell frequency and IFN\u2425 production might have contributed to the early onset of viral shedding, viremia (viral RNA in serum) and severity of clinical signs. This is similar to the IFN\u2423 induction by TGEV infection in suckling pigs (La Bonnardiere and Laude, 1981) . Notably, treatment of newborn pigs with the interferon inducer, polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine, resulted in a delayed onset of clinical signs when pigs were infected with TGEV (Lesnick and Derbyshire, 1988 ) and the IFN\u2423 treatment enhanced NK cell activity (Charley et al., 1985) . Also, treatment of TGEV infected suckling pigs with oral human IFN\u2423 increased their survival rates (Cummins et al., 1995) . In vitro studies of human dendritic cells stimulated with viruses show that neonatal cells are capable of producing IFN\u2423 responses similar to those of adults (Renneson et al., 2009 ). The increased IFN\u2423 may be the result of infection in suckling pigs in the early stages and may have led to the reduced PEDV RNA shedding in feces at a later stage compared to the weaned pigs.",

TNF\u2423 is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by activated macrophages, NK cells, T cells and other cells (Bradley, 2008) . Serum levels of TNF\u2423 are often associated with severity of disease (Jiang et al., 2003; Waage et al., 1987) . Studies of rotavirus infected children show that higher TNF\u2423 and lower IFN\u2425 are associated with more severe symptoms of infection (Jiang et al., 2003) . Similarly, studies of human rotavirus infection in a gnotobiotic pig model show that levels of cytokines like IFN\u2425 and TNF\u2423 are higher when pigs are infected with virulent virus compared to attenuated virus (Azevedo et al., 2006) . Human neonatal monocytes/macrophages stimulated in vitro with bacterial lipopolysaccharides or virus showed reduced TNF\u2423 responses when compared to monocytes/macrophages from adults (Levy et al., 2004; Valero et al., 2014) . In the present study, although the suckling pigs had more severe disease, their TNF\u2423 levels were similar to weaned pigs at PID1 and less than weaned pigs at PIDs 3 and 5.",

            "text": "IL-8 is a chemoattractant for neutrophils and is secreted by various cell types (Bickel, 1993) . Pigs infected with porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus that subsequently cleared the infection had higher IL-8 than pigs that did not clear the infection (Kim and Chae, 2003) . Therefore, the higher IL-8 in weaned pigs may have contributed to lower severity of disease. Similar to the pattern of IFN\u2423, the serum levels of cytokines IL-17 and IL-12 were high in suckling pigs at PID 1 and in weaned pigs at PIDs 3 or 5 and coincided with the delay in onset of clinical signs and fecal PEDV RNA shedding in weaned pigs. Studies of human neonates show that they are capable of producing certain pro-inflammatory cytokines in comparable levels to adults (Schnurr et al., 2005) . Therefore, suckling piglets could have a similar ability to produce these cytokines as the weaned pigs. Thus, pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles of suckling and weaned pigs mirrored the severity of infection and viremia. The suckling pigs lacked innate immune activity to delay onset of viral shedding and viremia that resulted in more cells infected and higher IFN\u2423 (Jung et al., 2015a) . In contrast, the robust innate immune activity in weaned pigs may have delayed the onset of viral shedding and viremia, resulting in a lower IFN\u2423 response. However, the innate immune response was not enough to prevent the higher fecal viral shedding at PID 5 in weaned pigs although there was reduced diarrhea compared to suckling pigs. The results also indicated the ability of suckling pigs to produce proinflammatory cytokines comparable to weaned pigs. CD4+ T cells represent T helper cells that aid in the humoral immune response and are responsible for Th2 cytokine production. CD8+ T cells represent cytotoxic T cells that are important in killing virus infected cells (Germain, 2002; Gerner et al., 2009) . The CD3+CD4+ T cell frequency was higher in the uninfected suckling pigs compared to uninfected weaned pigs, whereas infected suckling pigs had transient relative leukopenia at PID 1 and then had increased CD3+CD4+ T cell frequencies at PID 5 compared to uninfected suckling pigs. Neonates have a polarity toward Th2 responses dominated by CD3+CD4+ T cells and this changes when they are given viral vaccines and it also changes with age (Dowling and Levy, 2014; Kelly et al., 2007; Kovarik and Siegrist, 1998; Siegrist et al., 1998) . The present study confirmed that the neonatal swine intestine has increased CD3+CD4+ T cells that can be altered by viral infection. The CD3+CD8+ T cell frequency was comparable in suckling and weaned uninfected pigs and infection increased the intestinal CD3+CD8+ T cell frequency in both groups. Thus, the observed differences in PEDV infectivity between suckling and weaned pigs might not be influenced by early CD3+CD8+ T cell frequency. Since CD3+CD8+ T cells are involved in early antiviral adaptive immune responses, these cells are expected to play important roles in PEDV infection of the intestine. Longer observations are required to determine if there are differences in adaptive immune responses between the suckling and weaned pigs.",

Suckling piglets had lower NK cell activity (% lysis of K562 cells) compared to weaned piglets in blood and ileal mononuclear cells at PID 1 (A and B) and PID 5 (C and D). Blood and ileal mononuclear cells were co-cultured with CFSE stained K562 cells at indicated ratios overnight. The dead cells were stained by incubating with 7-AAD. The cells were observed by flow cytometry to obtain % of dead K562 cells. The groups that were compared were, suckling uninfected versus weaned uninfected, suckling infected versus weaned infected, suckling infected versus suckling uninfected and weaned infected versus weaned uninfected within a time point. The bar graphs labeled with different alphabetical letters are significantly different (P < 0.01).",
