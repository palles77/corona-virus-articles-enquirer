First, both glial and neuronal cells normally do not express molecules of the major histocompatibility complex. Second, the most efficient cells for stimulating an immune response (leucocyte dendritic cells) are not present in the healthy CNS; and third, there is no specialized lymphatic drainagefrom the CNS to lymph nodes to enable the immune system to be quickly informed of the presence of an infection. Nevertheless, the immune system apparently copes with the vast majority of viral infections in the CNS. This is clearly evidenced by the reactivation of latent CNS viral infections in some immunosuppressed patients and the dramatic increase in the severity of CNS disease in young or otherwise immunologically incompetent experimental animals infected with neurotropic viruses. The routes by which the CNS and the immune system may communicate and the varied ways in which an immune response may affect the outcome of a viral infection of the CNS are discussed.",

            "text": "central nervous system / viral encephalomyelitis I antigen presentation I immunity I lymphocytes I viral persistence THE IMMUNE SYSTEM has evolved in higher vertebrates into a complex, multi-factorial surveillance mechanism designed to limit both the spread of infectious organisms as well as the outgrowth of neoplastic cells. There appear to be few, if any, body compartments that are not patrolled by the immune system. The central nervous system (CNS) is, however, compared to most other sites, normally lacking in the essential elements and conditions known to lead to a rapid and affective immunological response. The paucity of immune elements in the CNS and the consequent lack of immune interactions that occur obviously has important consequences for the way in which viral infections of the CNS are handled. Recent experimental evidence indicates that the 'immunological privilege' of the CNS is by no means absolute and that there are some forms of communication between the immune and central nervous systems. Indeed, the immune surveillance of the CNS appears to be sufficient in most cases to control or eliminate most viral infections. Here we briefly describe those components of the immune system which are fundamental for effective defence against viral infection and illustrate why the normal CNS is considered to be so immunologically deficient. The possible mechanisms that enable the immune system to respond to a CNS viral infection are discussed and brief examples given of the way in which the course of infection may be altered by the action of the immune system.",

            "text": "The major histocompatibility complex and T and B lymphocytes Studies in the 1970s and subsequently (reviewed in ref 1) established the nature of the specific recognition requirements necessary for the immune system to respond to a given antigen and, in particular, for cytotoxic T lymphocytes to recognize and destroy virus-infected cells ( Figure 1 ). Most T lymphocytes can be subdivided into two non-overlapping populations expressing distinct surface molecules known as CD4 and CD8. The former subset predominantly exhibit helper/inducer function, whereas the latter is the most active in terms of cytotoxic capacity.2 Both subsets also express a T cell-specific receptor which recognizes peptide antigen (for example, derived from a virus present in an infected cell), only when it is bound to and displayed on the cell surface in the context of a major histocompatibility complex ( CD4 + T cell subset also provides help for antigenspecific B lymphocytes resulting, ultimately, in their differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells . Unprimed CD4+ (T) lymphocytes are activated following interaction with leucocyte dendritic cells (DC) which are a specialized and highly efficient type of antigen-presenting cell (APC) . DC may provide factors (indicated by the small arrow) which assist in this process . T lymphocytes use a specific T cell receptor (TCR) to recognize peptide forms of (viral) antigen which are presented to the T cell in the context of MHC class II molecules (C1 II) on the DC . DC are not normally present in the CNS and so this step probably first occurs outside the CNS . The activated, primed CD4+ T helper lymphocyte (Th) may now interact with a variety of APC, which could include macrophages, astrocytes, microglia and vascular endothelial cells . B lymphocytes can bind virus and also act as APC for CD4+ Th lymphocytes . The Th cells produce factors (indicated by small arrows) that allow B lymphocytes to differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells . CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL) see virusinfected cells through viral peptides presented in the context of MHC class I molecules (C1 I) . Th lymphocytes also provide factors which enable further differentiation of the CD8 + T cells into active cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) . Nevertheless, after viral infection, leucocytes, predominantly T lymphocytes and blood monocytes, may cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the parenchyma of the CNS. The appearance of these cells is usually accompanied by the upregulation of MHC expression on resident CNS cells and this is illustrated in Figure 3 . Although there are relatively few infdtrating cells (in Figure 3b only infiltrating cells and not the CNS are stained), substantial MHC class I and II induction on the CNS itself results (Figure 3a,d) . The MHC induction is probably due to secretion of cytokines such as interferon y6 by the infiltrating T lymphocytes.",

The CNS is also deficient in this respect. First, no specialized dendritic antigen-presenting cells (see Figure 1 ) are present in the CNS. 7 Macrophage-like antigen-presenting cells are present 8)g but most of these are not constitutively MHC class II positive.
