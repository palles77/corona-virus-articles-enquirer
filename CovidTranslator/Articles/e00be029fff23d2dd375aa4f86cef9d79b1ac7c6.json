In multivariate analysis, diagnosis of influenza was a strong independent predictor of both LP (P = 0AE02) and blood culture (P = 0AE05) being performed, and, in comparison with ORVIs, influenza cases were almost three times more likely to have a LP performed on presentation to hospital.

For instance, during the winter of 2006, among children aged <5 years admitted to the Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW) with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 68% received intravenous antibiotics and 23% underwent lumbar puncture (LP). 3 The following year, 2007, similar proportions of hospitalised children with confirmed influenza were given antibiotics (67%) and underwent LP (23%). 1 Pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections are recognised to follow influenza infection in children. 4 However, studies have shown that concomitant serious bacterial infections (SBI), especially meningitis, occur rarely in infants during the course of infection with respiratory viruses, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). [5] [6] [7] [8] Lumbar puncture is now not specifically recommended in infants presenting with RSV bronchiolitis, the policy having evolved in recent years. 9,10 Although comparisons have been made between the clinical characteristics of influenza and RSV, 11 there are few studies that compare the use of invasive diagnostic procedures, especially LP, in children with influenza with respiratory viral infections other than RSV (ORVIs); the rates of concomitant bacterial infection are also uncommonly reported. To this end, we have compared the clinical characteristics, the rates of invasive diagnostic procedures, particularly LP, and the incidence of bacterial meningitis and bacteraemia in children presenting with influenza or with ORVIs at the CHW, a tertiary paediatric hospital in Greater Sydney, Australia.",

Furthermore, whereas clinicians are more inclined to perform LP if, for example, a child is younger, has had a febrile convulsion or has a high fever, multivariate analysis showed that the only two independent predictors of LP were a diagnosis of influenza and age <3 months. Other studies have shown that the risk of SBI is very low in children with respiratory viral infection, but have not addressed whether influenza is a strong predictor of LP being performed. 6, 7, 13 For example, a prospective multicentre cross-sectional study, conducted in the USA over 3 years from 1998 to 2001, showed that the risk of SBI in young infants was significantly lower in children with influenza compared with those without influenza. 6 Another retrospective study, conducted over four consecutive influenza seasons in the USA, demonstrated that febrile children with influenza had a lower prevalence of bacteraemia, UTI, consolidative pneumonia or any SBI compared with those without influenza. 7 The rate of SBI in young infants with RSV was also lower compared with those without RSV. 8 Despite a very low prevalence of SBI, this study demonstrates that children with influenza had significantly higher utilisation of invasive diagnostic procedures, particularly LP. This can partly be explained by the fact that children with influenza presented appearing more unwell as manifested by their higher mean temperature (38AE6 versus 38\u00b0C, P < 0AE01) and mean heart rates (160 versus 152, P < 0AE01). This suggests that the children with influenza look clinically more unwell, and their presentation mimics SBI, including meningitis, and so full septic workups, including LP, are performed on presentation.

There were, however, no cases of meningitis associated with influenza, although admittedly the numbers in our study are not large, and in our view, a systematic review of influenza and serious concomitant infection is indicated to further address this question. Our study is important in finding that the risk of SBI in children with influenza or ORVIs was low during a busy winter season, and yet, children with influenza undergo significantly higher number of invasive diagnostic procedures on presentation that might be reduced by improved ascertainment of influenza directly on admission. There are high rates of immunisation against pneumococcal, Hib and meningococcal C disease in Western Sydney, which explains why bacterial meningitis is now rare. 14 Our study shows that about 17% of the children in the influenza group were younger than 3 months of age, while only 6% in the ORVI group were <3 months (P < 0AE01). However, overall, about half of the children in either group were aged <1 year (Figure 1 ). This is consistent with findings from other studies. [15] [16] [17] Many of the influenza cases in our study were too young to be immunised against influenza. Considering the high burden of influenza in young children and the frequent use of invasive diagnostic procedures, it is important to consider how to rapidly screen febrile children with respiratory symptoms during the influenza season, for example, with a rapid diagnostic test. Indeed, a rapid diagnostic test (QuickVue Influenza A + B; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates evaluated at our hospital during the 2009 pandemic season was found to be both sensitive and specific (84% and 98AE4%, respectively) compared with nucleic acid testing. 18 Studies conducted elsewhere also have shown good sensitivity and specificity, 19 but some rapid diagnostic tests perform better than others and their sensitivities, particularly, may vary according to the swab type, influenza virus strain and patients' age. 20 As children with confirmed influenza were very unlikely to suffer from meningitis, rapid screening for influenza during the influenza season may greatly reduce the need for LP; this may have economic benefits too. A study from Spain has shown that patients positive for influenza, using a rapid diagnostic test in the emergency department, had a significantly reduced rate of hospitalisation compared with those who were negative. 21 A US study found that using influenza status alone, as a screening test for infants with SBI (with a positive influenza test being indicative of low risk for SBI), resulted in a negative predictive value of 97AE5% (95% CI 93AE0-99AE2%). 6 From a clinical perspective, if the admitting consultant paediatrician were to review in person all cases being considered for LP, as occurs, for example, in Finland (T. Heikkinen, personal communication), the proportion undergoing the procedure may well be reduced. Notwithstanding, if meningitis is clinically suspected, the clinician should act accordingly, irrespective of the outcome of influenza diagnostic tests.",
