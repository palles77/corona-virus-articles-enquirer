Although some infections are asymptomatic, many cases present with severe symptoms that can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, multiorgan failure, and death. 4 MERS-CoV is in the Betacoronavirus genus, whose species are known to be potentially neuroinvasive. 5 However, very little information is currently available on the neurological manifestations of MERS and their incidence rates. A retrospective study in Saudi Arabia found that 25.7% of MERS patients developed confusion and 8.6% experienced a seizure. 6 Only four cases with central nervous system involvement (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, stroke, and encephali-Jee-Eun Kim a Jae-Hyeok Heo a Hye-ok Kim b Sook-hee Song b Sang-Soon Park a Tai-Hwan Park a Jin-Young Ahn a Min-Ky Kim a Jae-Phil Choi c JCN tis) and one case with critical-illness polyneuropathy have been reported for patients with MERS. 7, 8 Here we describe four patients with neurological manifestations that developed while they were being treated for MERS at a single hospital designated to treat MERS during the 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea.",

            "text": "Patient 1 showed hypersomnolence, ophthalmoplegia, and weakness in all four limbs after a severe viral infection, and we therefore needed to differentiate between various conditions including GBS variant, Wernicke encephalopathy, prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and critical-illness polyneuropathy/myopathy. Because this patient had a preceding infection history, relative symmetric motor weakness, and a monophasic course with a clinical nadir within 4 weeks followed by a plateau, we considered GBS variant as a possible diagnosis. 14 BBE, one of the GBS variants, is considered a subtype of GQ1b antibody syndrome and is classically diagnosed based on its characteristic clinical features of progressive symmetric external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and impaired consciousness. 15 Because patient 1 had the classical triad of BBE accompanied by limb weakness, a diagnosis of BBE overlapping with GBS was suggested. 14 We excluded many BBEmimicking conditions in this patient based on his clinical history, brain MRI, and CSF findings. The presence of antiganglioside antibodies and albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF supported the diagnosis of BBE as part of the GBS spectrum. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of BBE is largely dependent on its clinical presentation. The absence of laboratory findings does not rule out a BBE diagnosis. 16 Wernicke's encephalopathy was an important condition to eliminate in this patient because it also frequently manifests with varying degrees of encephalopathy, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. However, we considered it unlikely that Wernicke's encephalopathy was present in patient 1 for several reasons: 1) he showed none of the typical changes associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy in brain MRI, which has particularly high sensitivity (97-100%) in patients without alcohol abuse, 17 2) the ptosis and complete ophthalmoplegia that were observed in this patient are rare in Wernicke's encephalopathy, 18 and 3) thiamine deficiency was not confirmed in laboratory tests and the patient did not have dietary deficiencies or alcoholism. Critical-illness polyneuropathy/myopathy appears frequently in ICU patients but was not thought JCN to be present in patient 1 because ophthalmoparesis and ptosis are very rare in critical-illness polyneuropathy/myopathy. 19 Prolonged neuromuscular blockade was another possible consideration in this clinical setting, but a neuromuscular blocking agent was not administered in patient 1. The limb and ocular weakness had lasted for almost 2 months, and this duration would be an unusual response to the prolonged administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent. Neurological signs typically completely recover within 1-2 weeks in patients with prolonged neuromuscular blockade. 19 We hypothesized that patient 2 had ICU-acquired weakness or GBS. ICU-acquired weakness is diagnosed when a critically ill patient has limb weakness or ventilator dependency without heart or lung disease. 20 GBS was another possible diagnosis, since the patient experienced symmetric limb weakness following viral infection with a typical monophasic disease course. 14 These two diseases are differentiated by the presence of albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF, positivity for antiganglioside antibodies, or demyelinating or axonal patterns in electrophysiology. 18, 19 Patient 2 was evaluated neurologically after discharge, when her neurological symptoms had substantially improved; a lumbar puncture was therefore not performed, and critical information from laboratory studies was also not available. However, we cautiously supported a diagnosis of ICU-acquired weakness in patient 2, because a paraparetic presentation (as observed in this patient) is extremely rare in GBS and because dysautonomia and cranial nerve palsy, which frequently accompany GBS, were not observed in this patient. 18, 21 Acute sensory neuropathy was the probable diagnosis in patients 3 and 4, which may have resulted from a toxin and/ or drug or viral infection. These two patients both received pegylated interferon alpha-2a, ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir to treat MERS-CoV. Interferon alpha-2a rarely induces peripheral neuropathy, 22 and several studies have found complications associated with sensory neuropathy, vasculitic neuropathy, Bell's palsy, GBS, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy. 23, 24 Ribavirin is not associated with peripheral neuropathy, 24 while lopinavir/ritonavir is another possible causative drug. However, many people living with human immunodeficiency virus have been treated with this protease inhibitor for many years, and the risk of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir remains unclear. 25 CoVs are a group of enveloped RNA viruses that include the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus [including MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV] genera. 26 These viruses have neurotrophic and neuroinvasive characteristics, and CoV RNA has been detected in the central nervous systems of patients with various neurological diseases. 26, 27 A recent in vitro study evaluated the human tissue tropism of MERS-CoV in diverse cell lines, and revealed that it has the ability to infect human neuronal cells (NT2). 28 The neuropathological effects of MERS-CoV infections are suggested to result from immune-mediated processes, either directly by viral invasion or via molecular changes that arise from systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The delayed onset of neurological complications, the absence of the virus in the CSF, and the development of GBS-which is one of the prototypical immunological diseases observed in our patients-might support the immunological mechanisms of these phenomena. This topic requires further microbiological and pathological studies.",

The most likely diagnoses were GBS (including its variant), BBE, as well as ICU-acquired weakness and toxins (including drugs) or virus-related sensory neuropathy. It was particularly interesting that the neurological complications did not appear concomitantly with respiratory symptoms, instead being delayed by 2-3 weeks. Understanding that neurological complications are not rare and may be delayed is important because it might be difficult for patients with MERS-CoV infections to contact a neurologist while they are in isolation and because thorough neurological evaluations of these patients are rarely performed. Furthermore, some neurological complications interfere with the prognosis and require appropriate treatment, such as immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis for GBS.",
