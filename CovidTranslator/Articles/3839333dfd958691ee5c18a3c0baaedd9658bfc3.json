A highly purified (two cycles of CsCI gradient centrifugation) poliovirus preparation is able to transfer the y-phosphoryl-group of [32P]_ATP to acid precipitable material. When the reaction product is anal yzed by SDS PAGE, all structural proteins of polio are phoshorylated. Most of the label is incorporated in the minor capsid protein VPO and to a lesser extend in VP1, VP2 and VP3. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) was isolated directly from human stool in diploid human fibroplasrs, Viral antigen was expressed only after 210 days of incubation of the infected cultures. In contrast, HAV first adapted to growth in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells caused antigen expression in fibroplast cultures already 90 days after infection. During further passage the time of first appearance of antigen in infected fibroblasts decreased to about 14 days in both passage series (i. e. cultures inoculated with virus recovered directly from human stool or after adaption to human hepatoma cells). Antigen was predominantly cell-associated and was shown by immunofluorescence to be located exclusively in the cytoplasm. -Biophysical properties of HAV particles extracted from infected cells were comparable to those described for HAV extracted from human stool. Those findings are of importance for preparation of large amounts of HAV for vaccine. production.",

In additio n to P25 and GP28 of HBsAg two furt her proteins, GP33 and GP36, were found consistently in preparations from 9 different blood donors. The glycoprotein nature of GP 33 and GP 36 was shown by the increase of electrophoretic mobility after treatment with endoglycosidase H or neuraminidase. Immune precipitation with anti-HBs in RIPA-buffer confirmed the specifity of the glycoproteins, The change in apparent mol. weight after treatment with neuraminidase was larger for GP36 (900) than for GP33 (600) or GP28 (300). The data suggest that GP 33 and GP36 are multiply glycosylated proteins with N-glycosidic linked carbohydrate side chains of the mixed type. Inst, f. Virologie, Univ., HB s antigen screening was done in the blood samples of 1,790 pregnant women. 33 blood samples were found to be HB s antigen positive. 32 women were asymptomic carriers, 1 woman suffered from chronic hepatitis. 31 children have been born until now. The examination of cord blood showed HB s antigen in 6 samples; the venous blood samples taken thereupon demonstrated HB s antigen only in two samples. The HB s antigen negative children were treated with HBIG. The follow-up examination of the treated children showed no signs of infection up to now. -One child born to an HB e antigen positive mother was already infected at the time of birth. Another child born to an anti HB e positive mother became HBs antigen positive at the age of 4 months. Unfortunately, this child had not been treated with HBIG at the time of birth.",

We have shown an over 50 % redu ction in the am ount of viral antigen present on the memb ranes of these cells following incuba tion with SSPE antiserum. This was demon-strated both by immunofluorescence and rad ioimmunoassay. However this loss of antigen had no effect on memb rane receptor linked cAMP synthesis. This is discussed with respect to the effect of virus antigen insertion in cell membranes on specialised membrane bound functions. (1) We have analyzed the effect of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on the structure and DNA binding of D2-T antigen. On non-denaturing pore-gradient gels the purified protein migrated with an apparent size of 135,000 daltons, In vitro phosphorylation by the protein kinase associated with the purified protein resulted in a shift of most of the protein to a size of 740,000 daltons, and it was this form that contained most of the phosphate incorporated. This aggregation was completely reversible by treatment of phosphorylated D2-T antigen with alkaline phosphatase. Partial tryptic digestion indicated that phosphorylation of sites in the Nvrerminal part of the protein is responsible for the observed aggregation. -As show n by protein blotting onto nitrocellulose filters predominantly the 740,000 dalton form bound to SV40 DNA. However, onl y a fraction of the in vitro phosphorylated protein did bind to DNA, suggesting that aggregation alone is not sufficient for DNA bind ing. Subclasses of SV40 large T antigen were separated by zone velocity sedimentation. Three major forms, which sedirnented at about 5-6S, 14-16S and 23-255, have been shown to differ biologically and biochemically (1) . Each subclass was tested for specific binding to restriction fragments of SV40 DNA using an immunoprecipitation assay. -All three forms of T antigen bound specifically to a restriction fragment containing the SV40 origin of replication. However, the 5-6S form bound more origin fragment per unit T antigen than the other forms . The 5-6S form bound equally well to origin DNA in the presence and absence of excess cellul ar DNA , whereas the binding of the 14-16S form was reduced in the presence of cellular DNA . All forms of T antigen from SV40-transformed SV80 cells bound much less origin DNA than that from infected cells.",

The activation of retroviral genomes was tested by the determination of reverse transcriptase activiry in concentrated cell culture supernatants and by the demonstration of the intracellular localisation of retrovirus structural protein p30 applying the indirect immunoperoxydase technique. -C-type retroviruses were activated in mouse cells only by the halogenated pyrimidine analogue iododeoxyuridine. In Baculovirus-treated cell cultures no C-type retrovirus activation was detectable. In simultaneous treatments of the cells with Baculoviruses and chemicals no potentiating effects could be detected. Virions of Baculoviruses in mammalian cell cultures showed unaltered morphology and upon reisolation their infectivity in homologous insect cell cultures was lowered by approximately one log. No influence upon growth or morphology of the cells could be observed. The gene products of replication-defective oncornaviruses are high molecular weight proteins which comprise a gag related and one gene product. They are probably not cleaved because the p15 protease gene is lacking. In vitro, however, the gag-specific peptide sequences are cleaved off upon addition of the purified viral piS protease; in the case of the replication-defective, transforming avian sarcoma virus PRC II the cleaved nongag part has a ryrosine-phosphorylaring kinase activity similar to that described for the RSV src-gene product pp60 src .",

We could show that in addition to proteolytic cleavage, processing involves conversion of the high-mannose oligosac-charides found in Pr92' \" to the complex, sialidated oligosaccharides found in VGP. Experiments pertaining to the site of processing indicate that processing does not occur extracellularly as has been proposed by others iKlemenz and Diggelmann, J. Virol. 29 (1979) 285-292. We have determined that the small amount of mature VGP found in infected cell lysates is localized chiefly within the cell, not at the cell surface. We favour the view that further glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage occur concomitantly on smooth membranes within the cell and that subsequent to this, export in virus is rapid. 1 Paul-Ehrlich-Inst., D-6000 Frankfurt;",

In the case of the rnyelocytornatosis virus, MC29, which transforms fibroblasts as well as bone marrow cells in vitro , this oncogene is fused to a viral structural component, p19. The fusion protein, v-rnyc, was characterized by using monoclonal antibodies against p19. MC29 transformed quail fibroblasts which do not produce any virus, MC29-Q8, were analyzed b y immunofluorescence. A nuclear fluorescence was observed which was not detected in normal cells or virus-producing cells. The monoclonal antibodies were used to purify the v-myc protein by immuno-affinity chromatography. The purification achieved by this single-step purification was 3,500 fold . The eluted protein was precipitable by anti-sera and will be further characterized for its biological properties.",

Peptide maps performed with the antigens from two different leukemic sera show that the two antigens are identical. Peptide analyses of SiSV p30 and of BaEV p30 and simultaneous mapping of p30 proteins mixed with human antigens show that 11 out of 21 major peptides of SiSV p30 and 10 out of 20 major peptides of BaEV p30 have identical mobility with peptides of the human antigens. Human serum albumin, transferrin, fibrinogen, IgG and IgM share clearly less peptides of identical mobility with the human antigens.

Specificity of positive reactions wa s controlled by preabsorption with purified MMTV-gp52. 86 breast cancers (87 0 /0) and 13 benign breast lesions (30 0 /0) gave positive reactions, whereas normal bre ast tissue and other carcinomas were negative. -The test might be an additional useful diagnostic too l for the earl y detection of micrometastases, for the assignment of metastases from unknown pr imary tumors and in doubtful cases of breast cancer.

Nearly all illnesses were caused by mumps-and entero-viruses , Other viru ses were found in less than 5 % of all cases. The mumpsmeningitides were ascertained constantly over all these year s. In 1967 In , 1974 In and 1980 an increased incide nce of meningitides caused by Echo-virus type 30 wa s seen. -There was no seaso na l dep endence on the occurrence of mumps virus meningitides. Meningitides, caused by ent ero-viruses was found mor e often in the autumn. Male patients fell ill twice as ofte n as female patients. Mumps-meningitides were rarel y found in the first year of life. In contras t, enterovirus meningitides could be dete cted during the first year and caused men ingitides to age of 14. Virus meningitides among adults were rarel y found. We suspected that a number of peripheral facial pareses (P.F.P.) considered \"idiopathic\" might, in fact, have a viral aetiology . 71 patients of the Cologne University E.N.T. Clinic with so-called idiopathic P.F.P. were examined under the aspect of a viral aetiology. In 32 cases conditions for virological investigations were optimal (paired sera, first serum within the first week after onset of disease). In 10 of these 32 cases a viral infection could be proven (varicella zoster virus: 7, herpes simplex virus: 2, coxsackie B 4 :1). In 5 of 7 VZV cases minimal zoster lesions were observed, 4 facial and 1 thoracic. Among the 39 oth er patients (with late sera) no viral infection could be proven. In conclusion, by means of alert clinical and virological examinat ions, a considerable fract ion of idiopathic P.F.P. could be associated with a virus infection. 152 neonates were screened from the delivery to the time of discharge for rotavirus infections. Daily faecal specimens were examined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a subgroup of positive specimens were also tested by a negative staining electromicro scopic method. -22 babies (14.5 0/0) were found to excrete rotavirus. 20 of them were asymptomatic infected and 2 showed mild gastrointestinal symptoms. With one exception viruses were not detected in babies less than 24 h old, but 10.9 % of them excreted virus during the second day of life and after 10 days 30 % of the neonates were positive for rotavirus. -Excretion persisted for 1 to 5 days. According to our study most babies (40 0 /0) excreted roravirus for 3 days. -A great number of the stools (29%) from the first da y which were tested by ELISA were found to have nonspecific activity in the absence of rotaviral antigen. Theref ore such stool specimens should only be examined by electron microscopy. The single radial hemolysis test (SRH-test = hemolysis-in-gel test) is a suitable technique for detection of rubella and influenza antibodies in a large number of sera. In our stud y we looked for the effect of att achment of the viral antigens to the erythrocytes by different coupling reagent s. Chrom ic chloride, cyanogen chloride, glutaraldehyd and tetraazotized -0 -dianisid ine (TOD) were used for the sensitization of the erythrocytes. -In the rubella SRH-test no improvement on regard to sensitivity of the test was seen. Moreover it is not possible to detect IgM specific antibodies after different kinds of attachment in the SRH-test. -In the influenza SRH-test with allantoic fluid of eggs infected with H 3N2 virus it was possible to increase the sensitivity with TOD, chromic chloride and potassium periodate. If tween-ether treated hemagglutinin was used only after sensitization with TOD, chromic chloride and periodate hemolytic zones were detectable .",

Clin. Microbial. 1981) . 55 out of 210 Rota antigen positive samples contained sufficient RNA to produce a satisfying pattern in the SDS-acrylamide-electrophoresis. We demonstrate six electropherotypes with differences in the relative mobility of segments 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 . Of these diarrhea producing strains at least two different electropherotypes were found during every outbreak of Rotavirus gastroenteritis. Our findings are in good agreement with the results reported by Rodger ), Espejo et al. (1980 ), and Kalica et al. (1978 , 1976 . The so-called M-type of EMC virus is capable of inducing diabetes mellitus in mice by a selective B cell damage. The M-EMC strain used in our laboratory has partially lost this capacity. We attempted to reisolate a diabetogenic variant and to elucidate the causes of the change. Seven serial heart passages in mice did not enrich such a variant. Cloning of the virus stock yielded one clone diabetogenic in two of ten animals (5 clones tested so far), -In a different substrain of M-ECM virus (the highly diabetogenic Dvariant, obtained from Dr. Petersen) we found both diabetogenic and non-diabetogenic clones. Incidence and severity of diabetes has been shown to be age-related. T his safety study was to demonstrate whether or not granulosis virus (GV) of Laspeyresia pomonella can rep licate in vertebrates. After feeding GV to NMRI-mice, no virus induced antibodies could be detected within eighty days by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and no vertical virus transmission was observed. GV did not replicate in mice. Human sera, as well as sera from horses, cattle, sheep and swine reacted with GV in the RIA. By characterization the positive reacting human immunoglobulin c1ass(es), IgG showed the strongest positive reaction, less positive reactions were shown by IgE and IgM and no reaction by IgA and IgD. By concentrating the immunoglobulins of the negative reacting sera to 250 pg IgG/ml, all sera could be recognized as positive. Thus a non-immunological reaction has been suggested. Infection of human fibroblasts with cytomegalovirus induces typical cytopathic alterations. Cell rounding within 5-6 h postinfection (p.i.) is followed by an increase in cell size, appearance of cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions and a morphological change to an epitheloid cell shape by 48 h p.i. In order to elucidate the participation of the cytoskeleton in this alteration of cell morphology experiments were initiated in serum-starved human fibroblasts to visualize changes in actin arrangement by indirect immunofluorescence. A early as 3 h p.i. cytoplasmic microfilamenrs had shortened and were rearranged to a more irregular pattern. At 12 h p.i. actin fibers were absent from rounded cells. The same was observed in epitheloid cells at 48 h p.i. Cultivation of infected cells with phosphonoacetic acid resulted in a partial preservation of the normal actin fiber distribution. In contrast, infected cells did not exhibit major changes in actin synthesis as estimated from the specific radioactivity of cytoplasmic actin isolated from 3H-leucine pulse labelled infected cells by DNAase I-Sepharose affinity chromatography and SDSpolyacrylamide electrophoresis with fluorography. Chicken erythrocytes were coated with glycine-extracted CMV antigen and negative control antigen by treatment with formaldehyde and CrCl s and were used for detection of CMV specific serum antibodies in PHA tests. Their sensitivity was proven to be in good agreement and their specificity superior to results seen in CFT. IgM-specific CMV antibody detection was performed either after a simple and rapid DEAE-cellulose exchange chromatography of serum samples or by IgG immunoprecipitation combined with ME-reduction controls. The main advantage of the modified CMV-PHAT was seen in the stability of sensitized erythrocytes, which can be lyophilized.",

            "text": "There are reports that herpes simplex virus (HSV) could be isolated from the genitourinary tract of up to 15 Ofo of males without manifest herpes. In order to confirm these results we first wanted to establish a method for typing possible HSV isolates. We used 3 published methods: a plaque test in chick embryo cells, a neutralisation test, and the analysis of the early HSV-proteins (SDS-PAGE). All 3 methods yielded identical results. We then tried to isolate HSV from 192 materials of 181 asymptomatic males (89 urethral swabs, 55 seminal fluids, 48 fresh tissue probes). All materials were immediately inoculated into tube cultures of two cell lines shown to be highly HSV-susceptible. Additionally, the tissue probes were co-cultivated with permissive cells. We also induced cell fusion (PEG) in such cocultures. Despite all efforts we did not isolate any virus from all these materials. For an experimental approach to answer the question as to which viral genes may control pathogenesis after peripheral infection of inbred mice with HSV, we have isolated a variant strain (ANG-path) that proved highly neuropathogenic both upon i.p. -or intravaginal infection from the apathogenic strain HSV-1 ANG. Two alterations of the ANG genome have been detected by restriction enzyme analysis: the loss of the amplifiable 500 b.p. nucleotide sequence typical for ANG and a 400 b.p, deletion approximately at the position mapped for the structural viral glyco-protein D. Despite the induction of interferon and NK-cells both variants multiply to a similar extent, probably in the same target cells of the peritoneum. The spread from the peritoneum, spleen, liver, thymus and local lymph nodes to the eNS seems, however, to be controlled by the action of gene products coded for in only one of the variants.

            "text": "Passage of HSV at high MOl results in the generation of defective genomes which are of full length, consisting of a relatively short region of the wild type genome that is repeated. They are packaged into mature virus particles and thus leave the cell in a state that is capable of entering a new host. Such defective molecules are of interest as they represent a simpler model in which to study replication, recombination and packaging of HSV. -Such a defective molecule arising from the serial passage of HSVtype l-ANG has been mapped, and restriction fragments have been cloned into pBR 322 using the rec A-E.coH, HB 101, as host. -All the resulting clones were found to be unstable and to contain deletions, one of which has been characterised in more detail. The isolation and characterization of Tupaia Herpesviruses (THY 1 to 4) has been reported. The analysis of DNA of these viruses showed the absence of submolar DNA fragments, when the DNA was cleaved with different restriction enzymes, as well as of a stem loop structure, when analysed by electron microscopy. With respect to this genomic structure it was of interest to study he recombination events between THV 1 to 4. Recombinants were generated between these viruses using a co-infection technique in vitro on Tupaia fibroblasts. Recombinants were selected after the stocks of new progency virus were treated with specific antiserum against each parental virus. Different recombinants were isolated, plaque-purified and characterized. Results for one recombinant THV-R-26 between THV-2 and 3 were as follows: (i) The in vitro host range and the in vivo pathogenicity in juvenile Tupaia was altered compared to parental viruses. Phosphorylation of proteins is a posttranslational modification which is regulatory for the activity of several enzymes. Most animal viruses code for phosphoproreins and the degree of their phosphorylation is thought to be a controlling factor during viral macromolecular synthesis. Recent studies on protein kinases from a number of tumor viruses have raised the possibility that the phosphorylation of cell proteins is involved in the processes leading to cell transformation. -Incubation of purified tree shrew (Tupaia) herpesvirus (THV) particles with y.32p ATP resulted in the incorporation of 32p labelled phosphate into proteins. A nonionic detergent such as NP-40 was necessary for the detection of protein kinase activity. The incorporation of 32phosphate was proportional to the quantity of TH viral proteins, indicating that the viral proteins can serve as substrates for the viral enzyme. a_ 32p dATP or a_ 32P ATP did not function as phosphate donors. A divalent cation such as Mg2+ or Mn'\" is essential for the enzymatic activity. A product analysis revealed that six viral polypeptides are phosphorylated. The predominant sites of phosphorylation are the (f-OH groups of serine and threonine. In 1972 a herpesvirus was isolated from young goats with a severe generalized infection in California. This isolate has been characterized in some detail and named caprine herpesvirus 1. Recently a herpesvirus was isolated in Switzerland from goats with a similar infection. We report a further characterization of both isolates and propose their classification as Bovid Herpesvirus 6 (BHV-6). -BHV-6 multiplies rapidly and shows a broad hostcell range. Crossneutralization onl y could be observed with BHV-1 (IBR/IPV-Virus), in a one way reaction. In gel immunoelectrophoresis the serologic relationship envolved the major antigenic components of BHV-1. We have evaluated two methods for the analysis of antibodies directed against EBVspecified proteins: 1. Indirect immunoprecipitation (IP) and 2. Radioimmunoassay of electroblots of SDS PAGE separated EBV-specified proteins (RIAB). Using IP we have identified 20 proteins against which antibodies are made during infection, some of these proteins have also been found using the latter technique. Many of the proteins are only reactive with EA'VCA+ sera and not ractive with EA-VCA + sera and may therefore be candidates for the EA specifying proteins. It seems likely that the failure to identify all proteins using the RIAB technique is probably due to the strong denaturating conditions used during the SDS PAGE step. Only those antibodies directed towards the primary sequence of the protein will react with the blotted proteins, whereas with IP analysis the native proteins are available for interaction with the sera. Previousl y we demonstrated that the synthesis of EBV-induced proteins in superinfected Raji cells (Raji 51) could be divided into 3 phases: Primary, secondary and tertiary (Bay-liss and Wolf, J. Gen. Virol., 1981, in press) . Recent experiments show that incubation of Raji SI in the presence of canavanine and the absence of arginine allows only a limited expression of the viral genome. If the cells are released from a canavanine block (applied from 0 to 8 h post infection) then between 2 and 4 h later several new proteins are synthesized, however, if m-RNA synthesis is inhibited (with actinomycin D) after removal of the canavanine then these new proteins fail to appear. Amongst these proteins are members of the EBV-specified early antigen complex (EA). These results indicate that an arginine-containing protein is synthesized soon after infection and that this protein is required in an active form in order to synthesize m-RNA for the secondary group of proteins. Amongst these proteins are the major components of the early antigen (EA) complex.",

We are able to localize these proteins in the internal region of the M-DNA by comparing the protein patterns of recombinant and parent strains. The exact localization was so far not possible because the recombination events occured mainly in regions near the ends of the L-DNA. -Furthermore recombinants were constructed to identify the genomic region responsible for oncogenicity. The wt-strains of H. saimiri are oncogenic while attenuated strain 11-att, that was obtained from strain 11 has lost this property. This may be due to a deletion of 1,1 md at the left end of the L-DNA. Recombinants between this attenuated strain and wt-strains were constructed. The test for oncogenicity in vivo is in progress.

Lectins, which are known to bind very specifically to certain sugar residues (Concanavalin A to D-glucose and D-mannose derivates, Soy bean agglutinin to N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and D-galactose, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin to N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, Ulex europaeus agglutinin to L-fucose) were iodinated using the NEN-Iactoperoxidase system.

By this, eight viral glycoproteins could be identified, two of them were synthesized in the presence of canavanine, and characterized according to the type of glycosylation. Lymphocystis disease (LD) is a virus disease of marine fish with an almost world-wide geographical distribution. This disease is characterised by papilloma-like tumour lesions. Lymphocystis disease virus (FDLV) has been tentatively classified as belonging to the family of Iridoviridae. This report describes the anatomy of FDLV: The FDLV virions were isolated from a total of 22 fish with LD lesions, caught near the Doggerbank, including 12 flounders, 6 dabs, and 4 plaice, which were analysed individually. The purity of the virus preparations was examined by a negative-staining technique and the virion diameters were determined: flounder 227.5 \u00b1 12.5 nm, LDV-plaice 198.8 \u00b1 12.9 nm, and LDV-dab 200.5 \u00b1 12 nm. DNAs of these different LDV isolates were cleaved with different restriction endonucleases and the resulting DNA fragments were separated electrophoretically on agarose slab gels. The fragment patterns demonstrate that LDV DNA of flonders and of plaice are indistinguishable, but clearly different from those of dab. The determination of the molecular weights of FDLV DNAs using contour length measurements by electron microscopy resulted in a value ranging from 60 to 150 X 10 6 daltons. In contrast the molecular weight estimations by restriction enzyme analysis resulted in lower values ranging from 60 to 90 X 10 6 daltons. This discrepancy is probably due to a restricted, permutated structure of the LDV genome similar to the genome of frog virus 3 as reported by Granoff. The structure of FLDV constituents and its interaction with host cells remains obscure. In an effort to clarify the viral components and their functions we have studied the proteins and purified FLDV and searched for virion-associated enzymes. -At least 33 distinct viral polypeptides were detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The polypeptide patterns are remarkably specific for a given fish species (flounder, plaice, and dab) although some heterogeneity was found when proteins of individual fish of the same species were analysed. -It was found that a nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase activity is closely associated with FLDV particles. This activity hydrolyses ATP with a high preference. The reaction requires a non-ionic detergent and a divalent cation, such as Mg2+. Reaction rates and substrate specifities were determined. The products of the reaction are nucleosides disphophares and inorganic phosphate.",

In addition we have used a 37K-specific antiserum to detect its distribution within infected cells. -37K protein is a late viral protein appearing 5-6 h p.i. It is predominantly found associated with the cellular Golgi complex but never with structures representing pox virus \"factories\". Later in infection 37K protein is incorporated into single viral particles preferentially found in the cell periphery. Upon electron microscopy approximately 3040 % of morphologically mature virions inside the cell are enwrapped by a double-membranate vesicular structure. Thus 37K viral protein is probably a component of this vesicular structure and only vesiculated virions can be released by the cell before lysis occurs.",

Cleavage by thermo lysin or chymotrypsin yields non-infectious virus. We have analyzed the cleavage sites of HI, H3 and HlO hemagglutinins. The amino acid sequences at the cleavage site, i. e. C-terminus of HAl and the N-terminus of HA 2 are identical when virus is activated in vivo and in vitro. Under both conditions, an arginine residue connecting HAl and HA 2 in the precursor is eliminated. The elimination of argmme results in a shift of the isoelectric point of the hemagglutinin as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing. Non-activating enzymes cleave only one peptide bond in the HA 2-Nterminal region of activated HA and thus do not affect the isoelectric point. We have also analyzed the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin of fowl plaque virus (H7). A connecting peptide containing several basic amino acids is eliminated. -The data show that activation of the influenza hemagglutinin involves the action of a cellular protease with trypsin-like specificity followed by the action of an exopeptidase of the carboxy-peptidase B-type. The latter enzyme activity is associated with purified virus and can be analyzed by an assay employing peptides bearing 3H-arginine at the C-terminus. The carbohydrates of the glycoproteins of 21 influenza A strains containing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of all serotypes known to date have been compared by analysis of glycopeptides labeled with radioactive sugars. Analysis of incompletely glycosylated glycoproteins synthesized in the presence of glycosylation inhibitors allowed the determination of the number of oligosaccharide side chains on HA 2 \u2022 With all strains, the neuraminidase contains side chains of both the complex type I and the mannose-rich type II. There are distinct quantitative and qualitative differences between the strains in the distribution of type I and type II side chains on the hemagglutinin fragments HAl and HA 2 \u2022 The majority of the hemagglutinin oligosaccharides is located on HAl' These side chains are usually of type 1. Only the hem agglutinins of serotype H3 have, in addition, a substantial amount of type II side chains on HAl' Most strains have on HA 2 a single side chain which is usually of type I. With serotype HS this side chain is free of fucose, and with serotype H8 it appears to be missing completely. Serotypes H7 and H10 have, in addition to the type I, a type II side chain on HA 2 \u2022 These observations strengthen the concept that the primary structure of the polypeptide chain is an important determinant for the carbohydrate moiety of the hemagglutinin.",

Studies on acylation in other enveloped viruses revealed that covalent addition of fatty acid to spike glycoproteins is a more general feature. While in Sindbis and in Semliki Forest virus both species of spike glycoprotein (El and E2) carry fatty acid chains, acylation with the other viruses studied (corona-, influenza A-and paramyxovirus family) seems restricted to those glycoproteins that are known to carry fusion activity. This new type of modification of viral glycoproteins occurs in a wide variety of host cells including those of human, bovine, mouse, hamster, avian and insect origin (3) . -With the aid of controlled digestion of 3H-palmitic acid labelled virus particles and by the analysis of cyanogen bromide fragments of fatty acid labelled glycoprotein the fatty acid bind ing site in influenza hemagglutinin (HAt), VSV G-protein and Sindbis virus E1 and E2 could be located to the membrane spanning portion of the respective proteins (3).",

Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), the causative agent of a highl y contagious disease of young chickens result ing in severe necrotic lesions in the bur sa of Fabricius (Gumboro disease), is a non-enveloped icosahedral particle with a diameter of about 60 nm. Its genome con sists of 2 segments of double-stranded RNA with mol ecular weight s of 2.2 X 10\u00b7 and 2.5 X 10\u00b7 daltons. Th e virion is composed of 5 structural pol ypeptides with mole cular weights of 90 kd, 48 kd. 40 kd, 32 kd and 28 kd. The 40 kd pol ypeptide, one of the two main structural proteins, is derived from the 48 kd pol ypeptide, perh aps by proteolytic modification (1) . With immunofluorescence and \"i nfectious center assays\" we were able to show th at 1. after infection of isolated lymphoid cells in vitro only 20 Ofo of bur sa cells, 2 % of thymus cells and 5 Ofo of spleen cells produce infective virus (i, e. plaques in infectious center assays) alth ough the donor chickens were in the most susceptible age of 4 to 5 weeks. 2. the number of virus producing cells is not cor related with the appe arance of slgM or sIgG. 3. virus yields seem to be influenced by the cell cycle: the number of chick emb ryo fibro blasts producing plaques in \"infectious center assays\" is increased after synchro nisa tion of the cells before infection. 4. cells that produce infective virus show an increased uptake of 3H-thymidine. 5. isolated lymphoid cells from thymus or spleen as well as blood lymphocytes can be stimulated by mitogens to produce higher virus yields. infection of Borna virus without any influence of the immunoresponse. The antigens first appeared in the nucleus of neurons and sometimes fibroblasts, then filled the cytoplasm, most brilliantly 7 days post infection. Thereafter they disappeared from the cytoplasm, but remained persistently only in the nucleus in point shape. No morphological changes were seen in the infected cells during 60 days post infection. We can say that the virus does not kill the cell. For the destruction of nerve cells in in vivo conditions it can be pointed to the importance of the immunological events, which might cause the clinical pictures.",

At the 6th day after passage when the cell number reached approx. 7 X 10 8 cells/mouse, mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection of appropriate concentrations of VSV. Ascites fluid was harvested after 20 h. Virus production was exponential for at least 16 h and continued for at least 20 h p.i. -Approximately 3-4 mg of viral protein/mouse and 2 X 1011 PFUlmouse were routinely obtained.

W., STRAUSS, G., OTT-HARTMANN, A., SCHATTEN, R., and KAERNER, H. C.Defective virus particles arising during serial undiluted propagation of herpes simplex viruses (HSV) and displaying only a subset of the genomic information of the standard virus, represent a powerful tool to understand a number of virus-directed processes such as gene expression, and mechanisms of replication and propagation of the more complex standard HSV genome. We have examined in more detail the structure of one class of defective HSV ANG DNA (dDNA1), both by establishing physical maps as well as by molecular cloning. A model is presented explaining the defective DNA concatemers differing in size by insertion of a 550 bp nucleotide sequence originating from the IRS sequences of the HSV ANG genome. The concatemers are composed of tandem repeat units of 8900 bp size comprised of sequences of 6500 bp from the UL -and of 2400 bp from the terminal redundancies . By various molecular biological techniques it was demonstrated that the UL -sequences code for the major DNA binding protein of about 130K molecular weight, and for parts of the HSV DNA polymerase gene, both proteins playing a dominant role in viral replication.Inst. f.

The structure of circular H. saimiri and H. ateles genomes isolated from five different cell lines was analysed by partial denaturation mapping. Three different types of circular viral DNA structure were found: 1. Circular viral genomes consisting of one L-DNA and one H-DNA region of the same length as in virion DNA. -2. Circular viral genomes consisting of one L-DNA region with a deletion of various length which is compensated by a prolongation of the H-DNA region . -3. Circular viral genomes showing rearrangements of the viral sequences with duplications of the left end of unique L-DNA and a deletion within the L-DNA. -This approach helps to identify regions of viral DNA which are not necessary for the maintenance of the transformed state (deletions) and those regions which might play an important role in the process of oncogenic transformation (duplications).

The hemolysis in gel test (HIG) (3,552 samples) and an ELISA (1,134 samples) were compared with a sensitive hemagglutination inhibition test (HI). HIG and H I gave identical results, whereas with the ELISA diverging results were obtained in 14 % of the samples . 13 % have been proven to be false positive. For the examination of larger population groups the HIG seems to be a well-suited technique. We have shown in comparative tests involving 3,224 girls that the HIG can be performed with capillary blood as reliably as with venous blood.

One of these, the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is primarily manifested by inflammation of the retinal pigment epithelium, the uveal tract and meninges. Severe visual and neurological impairment can occur. In our experimental studies 14 rhesus monkeys were experimentally infected with Borna disease virus. After a 4-7 week incubation period a progressive retino-cerebral syndrome was observed. Focal inflammatory lesions in the retinal pigmentepithelium and the uveal tract were accompanied by encephalitic and meningeal infiltrates. Infectious virus could be demonstrated in the retina and in the brain. Experimental Borna disease can serve as an appropriate model for uveo-meningo-encephalitic syndromes in men. Borna Disease (BO) virus induced encephalitis in horses, sheep, rodents and primates shows similarities in many aspects with other so-called slow virus diseases. The EEG has shown to be a specific tool in studying encephalitides of different types in man. This is a report on the EEG of the BO virus specific encephalitis. Twenty-eight rabbits inoculated by different routes and with different virus preparations were screened for EEG changes. The basic frequency was measured optically and an analysis of the EEG was performed. The following conclusions were made: 1. A significant slowing down of the basic frequency was observed in the EEGs of BO virus infected rabbits. 2. Spikes and spike-waves were present rather regularly and correlated with epileptic seizures at the end of the disease when they appeared rhythmically in intervalls of twenty seconds. Rademakercomplexes appeared from the third week on. Virological and serological data collected from all animals demonstrated a strong correlation of BO virus specific reactions with the EEG alterations. The patterns of EEG changes are reminiscent of those in SSPE. EEG features in this kind of slow virus diseases may have rather similar characteristics which could suggest that they may underlie common pathophysiological mechanism. We established the primary cultures of neural retina and pigment epithelium of rabbit and of the brain of chicken embryo to study the sensitivity of each kind of cells to the",
