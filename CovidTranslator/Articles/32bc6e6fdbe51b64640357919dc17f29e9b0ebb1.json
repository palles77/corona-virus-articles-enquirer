Under the condition of strict prevention of NCP infections among medical staff, the implementation of PCI must follow rigorous guidelines, in order to minimize the risk of infections among psychiatrists and psychologists, and to reduce their exposure to stress and trauma. and control efforts for the NCP epidemic, with organizational and financial guarantees. This work was initiated by the Chinese Society of Psychiatry, with a team of experts established to organize intervention efforts and provide technical guidance (Chinese Society of Psychiatry, 2020). The management of PCI efforts is being carried out under the unified coordination between the Ministry of Health and Health Administrative Department in Shanghai, because the strongest medical resource is reserved in Shanghai.",

On January 28, the first four psychiatrists were dispatched to Wuhan after a 3-day NCP-specific skill training. The group established a PCI department in the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University, and set up a work schedule to provide assistance. Due to different populations being affected by the epidemic to different degrees, the psychiatrists identified high-risk populations on which to prioritize their efforts, in order to prevent extreme events such as suicide and impulsive behavior. They drafted the signs of psychological crisis and provided feasible methods, providing timely report to the leading group of the joint prevention and control of the epidemic situation. Thus, the ninth batch of the Shanghai Medical Team was dispatched with 50 psychological therapists on February 21, as a second team for providing of mental health support.",

However, infected people may face more severe psychological crisis and secondary trauma after the disaster (Peng et al., 2010) . Therefore, to ensure the ongoing provision of mental health services and reduce the risk of cross-infections, a remote consultation network is being developed and implemented by the Chinese government, where telephone or internet consultations can be carried out in a safe setting (see Fig. 1 ). The Shanghai municipal government has further employed third-party online platforms to deliver consultations and prescriptions. Patients who need onsite treatment or hospitalization will be recommended to choose a specialist agency near their home.",
