The city, described by Petrarch in 1364 as \"rich in gold but richer in renown,\" mythologized herself-Venetia, Queen of the Andriatic, at once pagan and medieval, her heritage not so much of classical Rome but the Byzantine East (5) . He painted her effortless grandeur in gowns of gold brocade, seated on clouds, trumpeted by angels, showered with jewels from the gods.",

She ruined foes but sanctioned marriage, her generosity even celebrated by Shakespeare, \"Honour, riches, marriage-blessing, / Long continuance, and increasing, / Hourly joys be still upon you! / Juno sings her blessings on you\" (6) . In this, another of her less bellicose appearances, Juno rains gold and crowns on Venice, grooming her for greatness and prosperity. Afl oat in sensuous color, she glances down at her. An olive branch, signifying honor, acknowledges a city \"mighty in her resources but mightier in virtue\" (7) .",

Poetry and utopian texts, as well as the art of Veronese's time, attributed this greatness in part to topography-though lapped by the waves, Venice maintained close ties with the northern mainland and amassed a land empire, the terraferma (dry land). Another link to greatness was harmonious interaction with nature and the cosmos. Venetian humanist Pietro Bembo proposed \"ideal love\" as key to this interaction. Likewise, Jacopo Sannazzaro in L'Arcadia (1500) attributed moral and spiritual perfection to human connection with the natural world and its rhythms (7) .",
