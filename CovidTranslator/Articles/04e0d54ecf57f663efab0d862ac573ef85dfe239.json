One of its drawbacks, however, is the potential for donor-to-recipient disease transmission. This risk is greatly reduced by excluding donors at risk of carrying infection and by testing the donor for transmissible infectious disease. Aseptic surgical technique in a quality environment, when removing the tissue from the donor, when processing and storing the tissue and during implantation is critically important to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Non-viable tissue grafts such as bone can undergo disinfection and sterilisation steps. During the past two decades the disease transmission risk associated with tissue transplantation has been greatly reduced by implementation of standards set by professional organisations, such as the American Association of Tissue Banks l 21 , the European Association of Tissue Banks (EATB) [ 31 , the Eye Bank Association of America l 41 , and governmental regulations. However, the incidence of transplant-transmitted infection is unknown and the studies needed to determine this have not been performed.",

Organ transplantation flourished in the early 1980s following the discovery and introduction of cyclosporin as an effective immune suppressant. This brought a large supply of cadaveric donors available that could also be used for tissue donation. Unlike the limitations of organ transplants, tissue transplantation generally is not limited by HLA histocompatibility barriers l 7 1 or by ABO blood group incompatibility [SJ_ No longer a scarce resource, the widened availability of tissue allografts encouraged new clinical use and brought attention not only to their effectiveness and advantages over autografts but also to their drawbacks, side effects, and complications. One complication of tissue transplantation has been transmission of viral infections of donor origin to the recipient [ 9 ' 101 . Viral infections can be transmitted if the donor has a viral infection and the viral levels are too low for detection. In asymptomatic donors who are recently infected, a transient viremic phase can exist prior to development of a positive donor-screening test for antibodies. Preventing donor-torecipient infectious disease transmission relies heavily on selecting safe donors not only \u00b7 through testing, but also by medical and social behaviour screening to select donors more likely to be free of transmissible infections. In addition, sterilisation with gamma irradiation can be important.",

Presumably, the cadaveric donor was in a viremic stage early in infection prior to antibody development. To date cadaveric testing for HCV RNA is not available for routine use. HCV RNA should be considered for cadaveric tissue donors as soon as test reliability has been evaluated particularly using cadaveric samples obtained up to 24 hours after death.",

As burn patients begin to receive potent immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine to block rejection of skin allografts, CMV may become a more serious complication of burn care and related blood transfusion and skin allografting. Further studies of skin allograft recipients are needed to determine whether transmission of CMV by skin allograft is associated with symptomatic disease as seen in organ transplantation recipients, or is asymptomatic as generally seen in transfusion-transmitted CMV infections in immunocompetent blood transfusion recipients.

An initial approach by the surgeon is to judiciously use tissue allografts only when needed and from accredited organisations, use sterilised allografts whenever possible and consider use of autografts and alternative non-human graft material. However, the most important steps are exercised by the tissue bank in excluding those prospective donors who have known or suspected viral infections or are suspected by their behaviours to be at risk for HIV and hepatitis (Table 5 ). Tissue transplantation is generally considered a non-urgent surgical procedure, permitting a careful tissue donor selection process. Tissue donor selection by tissue banks has evolved to include a direct interview with the donor's next-of-kin concerning the donor's medical history and risk behaviours for HlV and hepatitis along with blood infectious disease testing, a physical examination and the results of an autopsy examination, if performed (Table 6 ). These donor selection steps are essential activities that result in a low risk of transmitting viruses. In addition, many tissue allografts can undergo further processing and exposure to disinfectants or sterilants, all of which further reduce the hazard of disease transmission [ 65 1. Although there have been no carefully controlled studies of allograft recipients to determine the incidence of disease transmission, there is good reason to believe that established donor screening procedures, infectious disease testing and processing and sterilisation effectiveness to reduce or eliminate viruses, results in a very low risk of transmitting disease.

When the first truly effective immunosuppressant, cyclosporin, became available in 1981, organ transplantation flourished. The numbers of organs transplanted each year grew rapidly leading to implementation of effective programs to develop public support for organ donation. As organ donation grew, so did tissue donation. With the rapid growth of transplantation, early cases of transplant transmitted viral diseases arose from infections of the donor but could have been prevented if tests were available. The use of new and more sensitive donor viral detection tests has reduced the risk of recipient infections.",

Surgeons should use allografts only when needed and obtain them from accredited tissue banks. They should consider use of autografts, alternative nonhuman graft material, or processed and sterilised tissue allografts whenever possible tissue banks reduce the risk for rejecting those donors suspected to be at risk for HIV, hepatitis, or other viral or bacterial infections, performing a donor physical examination, reviewing autopsy reports, and the surgical removal of donated tissue using aseptic technique. Lastly, sterilisation of certain tissues can be very effective, but it is not universally applicable, because some viruses are relatively resistant to sterilants and because the clinical effectiveness of many tissues (such as skin, cornea, valves, veins) can be altered by sterilisation procedures [ll7J_ Application of all these steps will assure a very low risk of transmitting disease from the donor to the recipient.",

Consequently, it is not very immunogenic nor is it often rejected by the recipient, unless it becomes vascularised. Similarly it is not very efficient in transmitting viral infectious disease from the donor. Diseases transmitted through corneal transplants are listed inTable 4. The cornea is not efficient in carrying or transmitting HIV. Based on assumptions about HIV antibody test sensitivity, Goode et al. estimated that 3 per 10,000 cornea allografts would be from HIV-infected donors despite HIV antibody testing [ 111 . There have been several documented cases in which cadaveric organ and tissue donors were infected with HIV but the cornea recipients did not become infected. Although HIV has been isolated from tears, retina, cornea, aqueous humour, iris, and conjunctiva [ 12 -16 1, HIV from infected cadaveric donors has not been transmitted to cornea recipients [ 17 \u2022 18 1. This should not be surprising because the inoculum of HIV is small in the relatively avascular, hypocellular cornea compared to that in an organ transplant or a blood transfusion from an HIV infected donor.",

Despite testing donors for HBsAg and anti-HBc, HBV transmission can still occur because some donors can have circulating HBV at levels not detectable in routine tests.
