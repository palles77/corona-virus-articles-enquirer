In this study, mutational effects of the helicase signature motifs and residue L543 on the two activities were investigated. Either activity was inactivated by K643A-S644A, D702A, D730A, R855A, or L543P mutations. On the other hand, Q826A, D858A and L543A had activities, in terms of k cat /K m , reduced by 5-to 15-fold. AMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, competitively inhibited RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity. Analogies of mutational effects on the two activities and approximation of K i(AMPPNP) and K m(ATP) suggest that the catalytic sites of the activities are overlapped. Mutational effects on the viral accumulation in Chenopodium quinoa indicated that the activities manifested by the domain are required for BaMV survival. Results also suggest that Q826 in motif V plays an additional role in preventing tight binding to ATP, which would otherwise decrease further RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase, leading to demise of the virus in plant.",

            "text": "Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), a member of potexvirus genus belonging to the alphavirus-like superfamily, has a positive-strand RNA genome (\u223c 6.4 kb) with a 5\u2032 m 7 GpppG cap structure and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail . Open reading frame 1 of the viral genome encodes a 155-kDa replicase consisting of mRNA capping enzyme, helicase-like and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains sequentially from N to C termini. A disordered region of more than 100 amino acid residues and a proline-rich segment separate respectively the neighboring functional domains. These two flexible regions may allow one domain to interact with others dynamically during the viral replication process. The capping enzyme domain, expressed in membrane fractions of yeast, exhibited an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent guanylyltransferase activity by which GTP is methylated to form m 7 GTP before the m 7 GMP moiety is further transferred to the 5\u2032-diphosphate end of mRNA to form the m 7 GpppN cap structure (Huang et al., 2005; Li et al., 2001a) . Such distinctive capping activity has also been demonstrated in Semliki Forest virus (SFV) (Ahola and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen, 1995) , brome mosaic virus (Ahola and Ahlquist, 1999; Kong et al., 1999) , tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Merits et al., 1999) and hepatitis E virus (Magden et al., 2001) ; thus, it is probably a common feature of the capping enzymes from the alphavirus-like superfamily. The E. coli-expressed helicase-like domain possessed both RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase and NTP hydrolase activities (Li et al., 2001b) . With the RNA 5\u2032triphosphatase and the aforementioned capping enzyme activities, a cap structure could be formed at the 5\u2032 end of BaMV mRNA in vitro. The recombinant RdRp domain showed a template-dependent RNA polymerase activity and had preferential binding activity to the 3\u2032 noncoding region of the viral RNA (Huang et al., 2001; Li et al., 1998) .",

The documented RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatases can be grouped into three classes according to their primary structures and the catalytic mechanism employed. The meta-zoan and plant enzymes are of the metal-independent cysteine phosphatase type and distinguish themselves by possessing an HC(X) 5 RS/T motif, in which the cysteine residue acts as a catalytic nucleophile within the catalytic pathway (Changela et al., 2001; Takagi et al., 1997) . The enzymes from fungi, protozoa, and some DNA viruses constitute a metal-dependent phosphohydrolases class with characteristic of possessing two essential glutamate-containing motifs (Ho et al., 1998; Martins and Shuman, 2003) . RNA triphosphatases, derived from RNA helicases or helicase-like proteins, constitute another metaldependent phosphohydrolases class. This class includes the enzymes identified from RNA viruses such as reovirus , alphavirus (Vasiljeva et al., 2000) , dengue virus (Matusan et al., 2001) , coronavirus , and BaMV (Li et al., 2001b) . Both classes of the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases are also capable of hydrolyzing nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates and inorganic phosphate.",

Members of SF1 share similarity to nsp2 of alphavirus, while NS3-like proteins of potyvirus, flavivirus and pestivirus, and 2C-like proteins of picornavirus are representatives of SF2 and SF3, respectively. Across the three SF, GKS/T sequence of motif I (Walker A site) is conserved, whereas the consensus sequences of motif II (Walker B site) are varied, with DE/D sequences in SF1 and SF3 and DEXH in SF2. Based on the classification principle, the helicase-like domain of BaMV replicase can be grouped into SF1. Fig. 1 shows comparison of partial amino acid sequences of the BaMV domain and some of the SF1 members. In relation to enzymatic activities, all three SF proteins have ATPase activity. An RNA helicase activity has also been broadly corroborated on proteins of SF2; however, the activity was so far demonstrated only on a couple of SF1 proteins, e.g., nsp2 of SFV (Gomez de Cedron et al., 1999) and the helicase domain of TMV replicase (Goregaoker and Culver, 2003) . Like the helicase-like domain of BaMV replicase, nsp2 of SFV has also been reported to have RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity (Vasiljeva et al., 2000) .",

The lysine residue of motif I interacts with the phosphates of MgATP/MgADP and the threonine or serine ligates the Mg 2+ ion. The first aspartic acid of motif II also coordinates Mg 2+ ion and the following glutamate or aspartate residue may act as catalytic base in ATP hydrolysis. By contrast, functions of other signature motifs, particularly those of SF1, are relatively less addressed. As a step toward better understanding the relationship between activities and structures of the helicase-like domain of BaMV replicase, we set out to investigate the importance of each signature motif to its NTPase and RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities by mutational and kinetic analyses. Results of this study strongly sug-gest a common catalytic site for the removal of 5\u2032\u03b3-phosphate from NTP and RNA. The relation between the enzymatic activities in vitro and the viral replication in vivo is also discussed in this study.",

The former (NTPase) could be a prerequisite for the putative RNA helicase activity, and the latter (RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase) could be involved in the cap structure formation. Substitution of GAA for GKS in motif I abolished NTPase as well as RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities. In the present study, we examined the mutational effects of other conserved motifs of SF1 helicases with respect to these two activities. Leucine at position 543 was also included in the mutation list because the accumulation level of the viral coat protein decreased significantly in protoplast of Nicotiana benthamiana as Leu543 to proline mutation was introduced into the viral replicase . In addition, a DEIH sequence immediately downstream motif VI was mutated because it is analogous to DEXH box of motif II of SF2. Each of the targeted residues, as indicated in Fig. 1 , was replaced by alanine except Leu543 that was also replaced by proline. All the proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity and anionic exchange chromatography as described in Materials and methods. The purification results are shown in Fig. 2 .",

All four mononucleotides could be hydrolyzed by the wild-type enzyme at rates with apparent K m value ranging from 0.15 to 0.33 mM and apparent k cat from 24 to 67 s \u2212 1 .

Mutational effects of the targeted amino acid residues on the apparent kinetic parameters of ATPase were subsequently analyzed by enzyme-coupled assays. Consistent with TLC results, proteins with specified mutation in motif I, II, III or VI did not show ATPase activity to any appreciable extent (not shown). L543P mutant was also inactive; however, L543A was active with an unchanged K m but a 14-fold reduced k cat (Table  2) . D858A had K m and k cat reduced by factors of 2 and 10, respectively. Q826A had 17-fold and 90-fold decreases in values of K m and k cat , respectively. It is worth noting that the specificity constant of Q826A decreased only by a factor of 5.3; this and overtime incubation may account for the apparent ATPase activity of Q826A shown in the previous TLC assay. The significantly enhanced affinity to ATP should account for, to some extent, the dramatic decrease of k cat in Q826A.",

To characterize the effects in detail, reaction rates of L543A, Q826A, D858A and the wild-type enzyme were determined at different RNA concentrations, and the kinetic parameters were subsequently calculated (Table 2) . Considering the limitations, such as suboptimal substrate concentration, in data processing, the determined values of K m and k cat were apparent. Still, they should be helpful to evaluate the mutational effects. Comparing with mononucleotides, RNA was hydrolyzed at much slower rates. Alanine substitution at L543, Q826 or D858 had unfavorable effects on both RNA binding and catalysis as evidenced by the increase of apparent K m and the decrease of apparent k cat , respectively.

Data are averages of two independent experiments. be monitored by the appearance of green fluorescence because the expression of the introduced GFP depends on the fulfillment of BaMV replication (Lin et al., 2004) . To see the mutational effects, each of the selected mutations was introduced into pCBG, and the resulting mutant plasmid was mechanically inoculated into plant cells. As shown in Fig. 8 , spots with green fluorescence began to appear on leaves of plants infected with wild type, L543A, or D858A virus a week later after inoculation. The respective frequency and average diameter of fluorescent loci appeared on leaves were similar, suggesting that the three variants replicated equally well in C. quinoa. Local lesions formed later on leaves that had shown green fluorescence spots earlier (Fig. 9) . No signs of green fluorescence or disease symptoms were noted on leaves of plants infected with other mutant viruses, including that carries Q826A mutation. Repeated experiments with wild type, L543A, Q826A and D858A confirmed the negative result of Q826A mutation. Disability on RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase alone is sufficient to account for the replication incompetence of those carrying specified mutation in motif I, II, III, and VI and L543P since formation of 5\u2032 cap at viral mRNA is essential for substantial viral protein translation. However, the reasons for the opposite effects of the D858A and Q826A mutations in plant are uncertain because the two mutations decreased RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity to similar extents. Would it be possible that alanine substitution at Q826 affects not only the enzymatic activity but also the protein stability? Protein stabilities of wild type, L543A, Q826A and D858A were, therefore, investigated under 25\u00b0C by measuring their residual enzymatic activity as a function of time. The inactivation of the proteins followed first-order kinetics. The half lives (t 1/2 ) of wild type, L543A and Q826A were approximately 2 h, whereas t 1/2 of D858A was 40 min (data not shown), indicating that protein stability would not be the cause. Alternatively, the distinct feature of Q826A on ATPase activity might underlie the failure of the mutant virus to replicate in vivo. The mutant protein might not be capable of providing sufficient energy by hydrolyzing ATP to the putative helicase activity, or the tight binding of ATP deteriorated further the weakened RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity. Activity of RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase was assayed in the presence of 0.3 mM ATP, which is within physiological concentration range (Hampp et al., 1982; Usuda, 1988) , to explore the latter possibility (Fig. 10) . Under the competition conditions, RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities of wild type and D858A remained approximately 30%, whereas little was left in Q826A mutant. The results suggest that RNA and mononucleoside triphosphate could have reciprocal inhibitory effects in vivo; and the deterioration of RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity might be simply enough to disable the replication function of Q826A mutant virus.",

Sequence comparison of the helicase-like proteins from RNA viruses has disclosed the conservation of several signature motifs and grouped them into three SF (Kadar\u00e9 and Haenni, 1997) . Functions of helicase motifs have been addressed through mutational and structural analyses owing to the involvement of helicases in various important biological processes. As regards SF1, crystal structures of DNA helicases PcrA (Subramanya et al., 1996; Velankar et al., 1999) and Rep (Korolev et al., 1997) could provide us insights into the relationships between structures and functions of the proteins. In brief, residues on both motif I and II are involved in the binding of ATP through phosphate group recognition and Mg 2+ coordination, while the second conserved acidic residue of motif II acts as catalytic base in ATP hydrolysis. Other residues such as the glutamine of motif III and the arginine of motif VI also participate in accommodating the \u03b3-phosphate group of ATP.",

            "text": "As with other potexvirus, BaMV replicase contains a helicase-like domain which can be classified into SF1. In this study, contributions of the conserved motifs of the helicase-like domain to NTPase and RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase were investigated by mutagenesis. With respect to ATPase activity, motifs I and II are essential, consistent with the suggestions by crystal structures and mutational results reported in numerous literatures. Mutations at the aspartate of motif III and the arginine of motif VI brought on severe damages to the activity, also consistent with their involvement in ATP binding. Function of DEIH sequence immediately downstream motif VI is not analogous to that of DEXH box (motif II) of SF2 helicases because mutation of the sequence merely caused about 10-fold decrease in k cat value. Q826 in motif V seems to avoid the tight binding of the protein to ground-state ATP since alanine substitution at the residue reduced value of K m(ATP) notably. The otherwise enhanced affinity to ATP in Q826A not only had adverse effect on ATP hydrolysis but also caused significant interference with RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity. L543, located in a predicted short \u03b2-strand outside the helicase motifs, might have a structural role supporting the active-site architecture for catalyzing ATP hydrolysis. For one thing, L543 bears a hydrophobic side chain; for another, the destructive effect caused by proline substitution could be reversed to a certain extent by alanine substitution. Nonetheless, this proposition needs to be verified by further structural analysis. As for RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity, the effects caused by the various mutations were similar to those on ATPase activity, except for Q826A: the alanine substitution increased K m(RNA) slightly for the RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity, while decreasing K m(ATP) for the NTPase activity more than 17-fold. The importance of the mutated residues in the viral accumulation in plant was also investigated. Mutations of residues within the conserved motifs would disable the viral replication in vivo. By contrast, the two mutations outside the motifs, L543A and D858A, had insignificant consequence. The helicase motifs in 1a protein of brome mosaic virus have also been shown to play essential roles in RNA replication in vivo by presumably being involved in viral RNAs import (Wang et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Another aim of this study is to know whether the two enzymatic activities occur at a single or two independent catalytic sites. The generally parallel effects of the mutations on the two activities suggest that the protein employs the same amino acid constellation for the removal of 5\u2032 \u03b3-phosphate from RNA and NTP. Approximation between K i(AMPPNP) in RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase competition assays and K m(ATP) in ATPase assays supports the same idea. Still, we cannot rule out another possibility that the substrates might bind to two closely related sites with the ATPase activity driving a conformational change that activates the RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity, considering the opposite mutational effects on K m(ATP) and K m(RNA) of Q826A. Further structural evidence is needed to clarify the argument. Nonetheless, employment of a common catalytic site for NTPase and RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities has also been suggested on several helicase motif-base proteins such as SFV nsp2 (Balistreri et al., 2007) , reovirus \u03bb1 , SARS-coronavirus nsp13 and dengue virus nsp3 proteins (Bartelma and Padmanabhan, 2002) . This raises a question as whether RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity is an attendant function of helicases, or it is an adaptive outcome in the course of viral evolution. BaMV genome contains two copies of helicase-like domains. One is the domain within viral replicase, the other is the P28 movement protein encoded by triple gene block. With the essential role to the movement of virus in the infected plant, P28 protein also possesses NTPase and RNA-binding activities (Wung et al., 1999) ; however, it did not show RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity (Li et al., 2001b) . Taken together with the fact that only a few helicases (or helicase-like proteins) have been reported to have RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity, we speculate that the 5\u2032 \u03b3phosphohydrolase activity for RNA molecule has evolved from NTPase activity driven by the demand for functional capping machinery, by which the mRNA of RNA viruses can be capped within cytoplasm of the infected cells.",

Is it possible that a protein domain can participate in RNA replication while it is also responsible for the removal of 5\u2032 \u03b3-phosphate from the nascent RNA to allow cap structure formation? With the help of the flanking flexible hinges, the helicase-like domain may be able to work with the RdRp or the capping domains at different steps during replication process. Yet, we cannot rule out another possibility at this moment that the function of the helicase-like domain is for the formation of cap structure while the helicase activity required for BaMV replication is provided by hosts. Deferring the uncertainty of helicase activity, RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase itself is definitely sufficient to dictate the survival of BaMV in plant. Mutations that abolished the enzymatic activity in vitro could result in the demise of the virus in C. quinoa. Nonetheless, \u223c7% of the wild-type activity, in terms of k cat /K m , seemed to be enough for the need since BaMV bearing D858A mutation survived. The failure of Q826A mutant in C. quinoa is intriguing because it has even higher RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase function than D858A. Further inhibition of the weaken RNA 5\u2032triphosphatase activity by tight binding of ATP in vivo might account for the fatal outcome, indicating the need of a multiplefunction enzyme to coordinate all its activities for the survival of the organism.",
