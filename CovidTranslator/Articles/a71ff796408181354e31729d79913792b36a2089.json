            "text": "Although previous studies have reported that the gut microbiota is changed in calves during diarrhea, less is known about whether rotavirus infection alters the structure of the gut microbiota. Here, we characterized fecal microbial communities and identified possible relationships between the gut microbiota profiles and physiological parameters. Five fecal specimens of rotavirus-infected calves from 1 to 30 days after birth and five fecal specimens of age-matched healthy calves were used for the microbial community analysis using the Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Rotavirus infection was associated with reduced rotavirus infection significantly reduced the richness and diversity of the bacterial community. Weighted unique fraction metric analysis exhibited significant differences in community membership and structure between healthy and rotavirus-infected calves. Based on relative abundance analysis and linear discriminant analysis effect size, we found that the representative genera from Lactobacillus, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, and Bacteroides were closely related to healthy calves, while the genera Escherichia and Clostridium were closely affiliated to rotavirus-infected calves. Furthermore, canonical correlation analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient results revealed that the increased relative abundances of Lactobacillus, Subdoligranulum, and Bacteroides were correlated with normal levels of physiological characteristics such as white blood cells, blood urea nitrogen, serum amyloid protein A, and glucose concentration in serum. These results suggest that rotavirus infection alters the structure of the gut microbiota, correlating changes in physiological parameters. This study provides new information on the relationship between gut microbiota and the physiological parameters of rotavirus-mediated diarrheic calves.",

            "text": "Calf diarrhea is a complex and multifactorial disease that can be triggered by various factors (Cho and Yoon, 2014) . Numerous infectious pathogens are involved in calf diarrhea. Rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli, and Cryptosporidium species are regarded as the most important NCD-causing enteropathogens (Gulliksen et al., 2009) . Notably, rotavirus is known to be one of the frequently identified enteropathogens in feces from young calves (Izzo et al., 2011) . It is orally infected to calves, replicates in the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells, and destroys mature intestinal cells (Cho and Yoon, 2014) . It is a highly contagious viral pathogen that causes severe watery diarrhea in young calves within 2 weeks and a strong pathogenic agent that can lead to death due to dehydration by severe diarrhea in newborn calves within 1 week (Kapikian and Chanock, 1996; Ammar et al., 2014) . Infection by enteropathogens causes an alteration of normal gastrointestinal microbiota, which is thought to exacerbate diarrhea (Rolhion and Chassaing, 2016; Wotzka et al., 2017) . Disruption of gastrointestinal microbiota may lead to the promotion of intestinal inflammation, modulation of immune response, and loss of ability to compete with pathogens for nutrients, which are subsequently thought to be closely related to changes in the physiological components of the calves (Rolhion and Chassaing, 2016; Gomez et al., 2017) . In addition, the oral administration of antibiotics and medicines can significantly change gastric pH and are expected to adversely affect the normal bacterial flora, yeast, and protozoa of the stomach and intestines (Penders et al., 2006) . For the treatment and management of gastrointestinal diseases in calves, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of changes in intestinal microbiota and to analyze the correlation with the changes of physiological factors according to the causes of diseases. However, little is known about gut dysbiosis and the enteropathogens involved in NCD, and their-related physiological changes.",

All fecal samples obtained from calves were examined for the pathogens detection, such as coronavirus, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp., E. coli K99+, and a giardia using a rapid test kit (Bio-note) and for the Eimeria species detection performing fecal parasite test (floating/sedimentation test). For fecal parasite test, fecal material is mixed with a special liquid (ex, sugar solution) that causes the parasite eggs to float to the surface. The eggs are collected from the surface and observed the appearance to identify parasite type using microscope. In addition, fecal samples that were positive for rotavirus were confirmed by real time PCR, as previously reported (Cho et al., 2010) . Based on the above criteria, the experimental group was divided into two as follows; five normal fecal samples (17-30 days of age, 2 females and 3 males) without diarrhea and any pathogens (healthy group) and five fecal samples (3-27 days of age, 2 females and 3 males) positive for only rotavirus (rota group). Fecal samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until processing gut microbiota analysis. All procedures were carried out according to ethical guidelines for the use of animal samples, as approved by Chonbuk National University (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee [IACUC] Decision No. CBU 2014-00026).",

In contrast, the potentially harmful opportunists Clostridium_g21, Clostridium, Streptococcus, and E. coli were correlated with the levels of neutrophils, SAA, BUN, and WBC in diarrheic calves. At the species level, the similarities to serum glucose levels were higher in the order of L. amylovorus, B. glucerasea, G. formicillis, L. gasseri, and B. coccoides in healthy calves. However, the diarrheic calves showed a correlation between the relative abundances of C. perfringens and E. coli and the levels of WBC, BUN, and SAA. To evaluate the individual correlations between gut bacteria and physiological parameters, we generated Pearson correlation scores followed by an analysis of variance (Table 1) . At the genus level, Lactobacillus, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, and Bacteroides correlated negatively with WBC, BUN, and SAA, whereas they correlated positively with glucose. Importantly, these genera did not correlate with neutrophils. In contrast, Escherichia correlated positively neutrophils and BUN, and Streptococcus correlated positively with WBC, neutrophils, and SAA. At the species level, L. gasseri, G. formicillis, and B. glucerasea correlated negatively with WBC Correlation is significant at the *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 level and BUN, while C. perfringens correlated positively with WBC and SAA. Interestingly, E. coli correlated with all clinical characteristics (positively with WBC, neutrophils, BUN, and SAA; negatively with glucose levels).

However, there is a limited amount of information regarding the correlation between specific changes in the gut microbiota and the physiological parameters of neonatal calf diarrhea. In this study, we found an altered gut microbiota structure in rotavirus-infection calves and demonstrated a significant association between the gut microbiota and the physiological parameters via feces and serum analysis of healthy and rotavirus diarrheic calves. First, we evaluated the dissimilarity in community membership and structure of the gut microbiota between healthy and rotavirus diarrheic calves. Then, to evaluate the correlation between the gut microbiota and physiological parameters, we generated Pearson correlation scores and performed canonical correlation analyses. In the present study, a total of 1,221,812 reads were used for the final analysis, with an average of 81,454 reads per calf. We identified bacterial genera that discriminated between healthy and rotavirus diarrhea. Then, we found low bacterial diversity in rotavirus diarrhea through the analysis of rarefaction curves and alpha-diversity, which is a well-known hallmark of dysbiosis. In the early stages of life in the calves, the incidence of diarrhea was associated with a decrease in bacterial diversity in the gut (Oikonomou et al., 2013) .",

In this study, we found alterations in the gut microbiota of neonatal diarrhea samples as a result of rotavirus infection. The relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increased in healthy calves, while Proteobacteria was abundant in rotavirus diarrhea samples, which is consistent with a previous report showing that the phylum Proteobacteria in rotavirus diarrhea is associated with gut dysbiosis and inflammation (Singh et al., 2015) . At the genus level, in rotavirus-infected calves, there was significant increase of the genera Escherichia, Clostridium, and Streptococcus. However, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, Bacteroides, and Coprococcus were decreased. Notably, Lactobacillus was significantly decreased in the rotavirus diarrhea group.",

            "text": "Next, we compared the gut microbiota of healthy and rotavirus diarrheic calves at the species level. The profile of the species level was similar to the profile observed in other studies of intestinal dysbiosis. In general, an increased microbial diversity was associated with a healthy intestine, where previous studies associated a reduction of alpha-diversity with infections of C. difficile and IBD-and IBS-diarrhea subtypes (Kostic et al., 2014) . Our relative abundance analysis revealed that Lactobacillus species such as L. gasseri and L. amylovorus were found to be relatively abundant in healthy calves. L. gasseri is known to prevent the severity of acute selflimiting diarrhea in adults, comparable to effective monobacterial medicine (Margreiter et al., 2006) . Moreover, the re-lative abundance of G. formicillis, B. glucerasea, B. coccoides, and B. obeum were significantly higher in the healthy group. In contrast, the study identified two species of C. perfringens and E. coli that were associated with the diarrheic calves. Our Pearson correlation results showed that Lactobacillus, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, and Bacteroides were negatively correlated with WBC, BUN, and SAA levels, but positively correlated with glucose level. In contrast, Escherichia and Streptococcus positively correlated with physiological parameters, notably neutrophil levels. At the species level, L. gasseri, G. formicillis, and B. glucerasea were negatively correlated with WBC, BUN, and SAA levels. Notably, the prevalence of the E. coli was associated with all physiological parameters (positively WBC, neutrophils, BUN and SAA, and negatively glucose), and the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea. Interestingly, the E. coli was the only species that positively correlated with neutrophils. The optimization of feed efficiency and diarrhea prevention without antibiotics is a major goal of any livestock production system. In this regard, our results that rotavirus infection alters the structure of the gut microbiota, which correlates changes in physiological parameters would provide new insight into the treatment of rotavirus-mediated diarrhea in calves.",
