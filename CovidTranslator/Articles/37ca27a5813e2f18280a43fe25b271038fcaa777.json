            "text": "Light-handed regulation (LHR), where prices are not directly determined by regulation unless specific circumstances arise, has characterized airport regulation in Australian since 2002 and in New Zealand since the late 1980s. The approaches used in both countries have attracted the interest of government organizations considering potential changes in airport regulatory frameworks as well as others interested in airport economics. Governments and airport regulators have shown an interest in alternative regulatory approaches to traditional regulation of airport services involving direct price setting, such as price cap or rate of return regulation. Some examples include the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) (2001) in Ireland in consultations related to the development of regulatory arrangements and the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (2009) in a White Paper which reviews alternative approaches to regulation for privatized airports in India. Forsyth (2002 Forsyth ( , 2008 has examined the performance of light handed regulation in Australia and New Zealand. Domney et al. (2005) have explored the relationship between privatization, regulation, market power, profitability and technical efficiency of New Zealand and Australian airports under different regulatory regimes. Two papers, one by Schuster (2009) and one by O'Donnell et al. (2011) have reviewed the experience of LHR of Sydney Airport.",

It is examined from the point of view of whether it can and has achieved the stated objectives associated with its introduction in each country. While there are often political and philosophical objectives associated with the introduction of LHR, it is the performance of LHR in relation to stated objectives associated with its introduction in Australia and New Zealand that is of concern here. By examining the evolution of LHR and the approaches taken to the design of LHR of airports in Australia and New Zealand an increased understanding of LHR and its effectiveness as a regulatory tool is achieved. Three distinct models of LHR are examined; the initial information disclosure regulation introduced in New Zealand in the late 1980s, price and quality of service monitoring introduced in Australia in 2002, and enhanced information disclosure regulation introduced in New Zealand in 2008. An examination of the design of alternative approaches to LHR offers an alternative way of understanding some of the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to LHR. It is important for governments considering the application of LHR to airports with market power to understanding how different approaches to LHR have performed.",

The different approaches have mainly been assessed by drawing on the findings from independent inquiries on the regulatory frameworks (Productivity Commission, 2006 NZCC, 2002) and two reports on airport performance under the new information disclosure approach in New Zealand (NZCC, 2013a (NZCC, , 2013b . In addition, government documents and industry literature have been reviewed and discussions held with industry and government representatives in Australia and New Zealand. 1 The focus of this paper is on LHR in the form of price and quality of service monitoring in Australia and information disclosure regulation in New Zealand. This regulation has three key design elements in common: information requirements, reporting arrangements, and a threat of stronger regulation. Approaches involving regulatory intervention to resolve disputes in the event that negotiations fail, including negotiate-arbitrate regulation, is another form of LHR that has been applied to airports in Australia. This approach is not the focus of this paper.",

            "text": "Airports have a number of economic characteristics which are different, or at least different in degree, from other regulated industries. Airports can be subject to some competitive influences including the existence of secondary airports; there is substitutability in the location of some airport services, such as heavy maintenance; airlines may have countervailing buyer power and potentially non-aeronautical competitive services may influence the pricing of aeronautical services. For many airports competitive influences on airport prices imply that economic regulation is either not warranted, or that 'lighter' or less intrusive regulation is appropriate. Starkie (2008) , for example, has raised the issue of the appropriateness of traditional approaches to regulation of airports involving direct controls on prices, such as price caps and rate of return regulation. He supports the use of lighter handed approaches or no regulation at all. Biggar (2011) has presented an alternative view and argues that economic regulation of airports is not about constraining the potential use of market power by airports and the consequent misallocation of resources, but rather the major purpose is the protection and promotion of sunk complementary investments by airport users. Biggar argues that if this is a primary purpose of airport regulation then control of prices in order to prevent price shocks is important for users.",

An example of this is challenges for the Commission for Aviation in Ireland in determining five year price caps for Dublin Airport for the period 2010e2014 when there was a large capital expenditure project for a new airport terminal and very rapid changes in demand for airport services (Arblaster, 2010) .",

            "text": "Australia and New Zealand have been leaders in the introduction of LHR to airports services. LHR of airport services arose for different reasons in each country. In New Zealand there was a general preference for light handed approaches to regulation in situations where economic regulation was warranted following a wide-ranging reform program in the late 1980s (Bollard and Pickford, 1995) . According to Small (2000) policy-makers in post-1984 New Zealand saw deficiencies in regulation and chose the absence of regulation at least in its traditional form. Prior to 2010 airport operators were required to consult with their major airline customers when setting charges and required to disclose specified information under the AAA. In addition they were subject to general competition law under the Commerce Act which included the threat of price control. In Australia changes to airport regulation followed reforms to competition policy which began in the 1990s. As part of the reform process Australia adopted a United Kingdom style approach to regulation of structurally separated monopoly elements in utilities. Airport regulation included price caps on aeronautical services as well as other complementary measures. Price cap regulation raised a number of issues for the ACCC and the aviation industry. 2 Regulatory provisions covering \"necessary new investment\" which allowed for increases in prices outside the cap were ill-defined and difficult to interpret. The exact coverage 3 of the price cap was unclear and arbitrary because of the definition of aeronautical services, i.e. what was in and out of the price cap was based on the method of charging at the time of privatization. The new investment and other provisions led to a multitude of price determinations which resulted in price cap regulation being more interventionist than originally envisaged. A culmination of events in 2001, the terrorist attacks in the United States followed by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic and the demise of a major domestic airline, Ansett Australia, led to a downturn in air traffic and ensuing falls in airport revenues. Immediately following these events Australian airports reported reductions in traffic of 30e40 per cent (Productivity Commission, 2002) . The Government replaced price caps with price monitoring consistent with recommendations in a Productivity Commission review (Productivity Commission, 2002) .",

At the time of privatization explicit values were not established for airport assets for regulatory purposes, with the exception of Sydney Airport where the value of aeronautical assets was determined through a regulatory price determination process. Asset values used in the ACCC monitoring report until 2006e2007 reflected significant revaluations that occurred at most of the airports after privatization. Airport profitability measures became distorted and some airports sought to justify higher airport charges on the basis of revalued assets. This created industry tensions and undermined the value of reported information. Following a recommendation of the Productivity Commission a \"line in the sand\" approach to asset valuation was adopted whereby asset values reflected the value of assets at 30 June 2005 plus adjustments for new investment (Productivity Commission, 2006; ACCC, 2010) . Table 3 compares reporting requirements under LHR in Australia and New Zealand. The key distinguishing characteristic of the information disclosure framework operating under the AAA in New Zealand prior to 2011 was that there was no review and public reporting on the information disclosed by an independent government agency. The Australian monitoring framework permits the ACCC to make judgments on trends on historical financial information indicators of costs, profits and prices. By comparison, the new regulatory framework in New Zealand gives the NZCC a more active role in assessing information disclosed by airports.",

Factors that contributed to the ACT conclusion were that no conduct on the part of Sydney Airport had to-date \"stimulated any further Government action or interest\" and that there was: \"no firm basis upon which there can be any conclusion as to what the Commonwealth Government's policy would be at any particular time in the future, that there would be a delay of at least several years before stronger regulation came into operation, if stronger regulation came into operation it would not operate retrospectively and so airlines would not be able to redress the consequences of Sydney Airport's market power\". (ACT, 2005, p. 129) The issue of the credibility of the threat of stronger regulation has been a key issue for the two reviews of LHR by the Productivity Commission in Australia. Both inquiries have recommended additional procedures to increase the credibility of a threat of stronger regulation referred to as a 'show cause' mechanism (Productivity Commission, 2006 . The proposed 'show cause' mechanisms involved the initiation of further inquiries with associated delays and uncertainty (Arblaster, 2011) . Following negative industry reaction the Australian Government did not implement the 'show cause' mechanism recommended by the 2006 inquiry (National Aviation Policy Review, 2009) nor did it implement the 2011 recommendation to introduce a 'show cause' mechanism (Australian Government, 2012) . Airlines have seen the credibility of threat of stronger regulation as a crucial element of LHR (Airline Industry, 2011).",

The NZCC was required to report on whether a recommendation should be made resulting in the imposition of price controls over airfield activities at any of the three major airports. This assessment involved examining airport performance from the point of view of economic efficiency (NZCC, 2002) . A large amount of additional data that was not available from the information disclosure framework was required. Analysis on the performance of the three major airports took place over a four year timeframe. 5 LHR in Australia provides information on historical trends on broad financial indicators. As the information provided is not governed by detailed prescribed methodologies designed to provide information on economic costs and revenues it is not possible to make conclusive assessments of whether airports are economically efficient from ACCC monitoring reports. The 2006, 2011 Productivity Commission inquiries did not undertake their own empirical analysis of the performance outcomes at each of the monitored airports. In the 2006 report the Productivity Commission sought to provide \"an indicative picture\" of experience under LHR (Productivity Commission, 2006, p. 12) . In a submission to the 2011 Inquiry Forsyth and Niemeier (2011) argue measurements and analysis have not been done to assess whether \"the airports have been performing well in the critical aspects of productivity and the use of market power\" and so they \"cannot conclude that the airports are operating and pricing efficiently\" (p. 5). The Productivity Commission's views about the performance of monitored airports in the 2011 Inquiry were largely based on existing international benchmarking studies including studies undertaken by the Air Transport Research Society (ATRS) and submissions from participants to the inquiry.",

In Australia there is a general regulatory framework under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 which governs access to essential facilities with monopoly characteristics which include provision for interested parties to seek declaration of infrastructure services, such as aeronautical services. A declaration process can be initiated by an airline or another interested party. Declaration of a service allows negotiation of terms of access to the service with the ability to seek legally binding arbitration by the ACCC if agreement cannot be reached. 6 Under negotiate-arbitrate regulation (NAR) the prospect of an arbitration acts as a credible threat of a stronger regulatory measure. However, the role of the government is limited to making a decision on a recommendation for declaration of a service. Littlechild (2012) considers that in general LHR has worked well in Australia but the adoption of independent dispute resolution processes would lead to the alleviation of some airline concerns about regulation. The Australian Government accepted the recommendation from the 2011 Productivity Commission inquiry for a continuation of monitoring (Australian Government, Department of Infrastructure and Transport, 2012). However, the Government's response to the 2011 Productivity Inquiry noted the expected review of the national access provisions by the Productivity Commission. This was commenced late in 2012. Submissions to the review from airlines and Australian Government organizations support the continuation of the national access framework with changes to its design to increase its effectiveness. 7 NAR contained in the national access regime is a possible alternative, or complementary, approach to price and quality of service monitoring by the ACCC. NAR provides targeted regulation to identified concerns about the possible use of airport market power. A credible threat of stronger regulation is provided in the form of arbitration provisions.",

On the one hand frameworks designed to be truly 'light' in the sense of minimizing compliance and administrative costs and minimizing the intrusion into industry decision making have not provided sufficient information to assess whether airports are economically efficient, and in particular whether they are using their market power. The new regulatory framework in New Zealand is designed to provide information which is rigorous, comparable between airports and facilitates a broader assessment of airport performance. This approach to the design of LHR is more likely to provide information on whether airport performance is economically efficient and on the use of airport market power. However, the New Zealand approach involves a relatively high degree of intrusion into airport decision making and compliance and administrative costs are more significant.",

It seems that the existence of a credible threat of stronger regulatory measures is an important feature of the design of LHR. The lack of a credible threat of stronger regulation in the initial New Zealand framework was an important influence on the adoption of the stronger regulatory approach introduced in 2008. In Australia, two Productivity Commission inquiries recommended measures to strengthen the threat of stronger regulation. The industry and the Australian Government saw deficiencies associated with the specific Productivity Commission recommendations to strengthen the credibility of the threat of stronger regulation through adopting a 'show cause' provision. However, submissions from Australian Government departments have supported improvements to the design of the national access framework to allow it to become a more effective regulatory mechanism for infrastructure industries, including airports. Increasing the effectiveness of negotiate arbitrate arrangements under the national access regime is an alternative way of strengthening the credibility of stronger regulation while still encouraging negotiated outcomes.",

Establishing airport asset values has proven to be a complex task under traditional regulation and which has not been overcome by taking a light-handed approach.",
