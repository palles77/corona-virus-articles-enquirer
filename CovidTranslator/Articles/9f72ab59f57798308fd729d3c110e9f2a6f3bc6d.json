            "text": "A 7-month-old unvaccinated domestic shorthair cat was presented with a history of inappetence and hypersalivation. Clinical examination revealed fever, gingivitis and oral ulceration. An initial blood sample revealed a severe leukopenia and neutropenia and a feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) titre of 1:640; a second titre 10 days later was 1:2,560. A feline calicivirus (FCV) titre was 1:320 and the initial clinical signs and laboratory findings were attributed to a coinfection with FPV and FCV. The cat was treated with interferon omega. A blood sample taken 10 days later revealed a severe thrombocytosis of 3,448\u00d710 9 /L (reference range 200-500\u00d710 9 /L) confirmed by blood smear examination. The platelet count on day 35 was 4,990\u00d710 9 /L. No bone marrow examination was carried out. Two differential diagnoses for an extreme thrombocytosis are a reactive thrombocytosis or essential thrombocythemia (ET). ET is a hemic neoplasia that causes a severe and persistent thrombocytosis, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Reactive thrombocytosis is generally mild to moderate and of shorter duration than described here, but an excessive response could have been caused by infection. The influence of additional factors such as an initial thrombocytopenia, age and interferon treatment are not clear but can be speculated on. Although the exact pathophysiology in this case remains unclear, such high, persistent thrombocyte numbers have not been reported in cats in the absence of a neoplastic process.",

Platelet production is regulated mainly by thrombopoietin (Tpo), which causes the lineage-specific differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into committed megakaryocytic progenitor cells, and the proliferation and further differentiation of megakaryoblasts to megakaryocytes (Dame and Sutor 2005) . Tpo is produced primarily by hepatocytes but also by renal tubular cells and bone marrow stromal cells (Kaushansky 2005) . A negative feedback loop exists between the levels of Tpo and the number of platelets: circulating Tpo binds to and is taken up by platelets and destroyed. A greater mass of platelets will therefore result in lower levels of Tpo which in turn will result in decreased platelet production. In thrombocytopenic states, lower numbers of platelets mean less Tpo binding, uptake and destruction, leading to higher Tpo levels and thus increased thrombopoiesis (Kaushansky 2005) . This process is illustrated in Fig. 3 .",

Reactive thrombocytosis has been described in cats, dogs, horses and other animal species, and two retrospective studies have been published concerning reactive thrombocytosis in cats (Hammer 1991; Rizzo et al. 2007 ). In the earlier study by Hammer (1991) , in which results from 17 cats were examined, the most common causes overall were found to be neoplastic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, urinary and hematological disorders. In the more recent study by Rizzo et al. (2007) of thrombocytosis in 51 cats, it was found that reactive thrombocytosis occurred most commonly secondary to gastrointestinal, endocrine, cardiovascular, urinary, respiratory, hematological and musculoskeletal diseases. None of the diagnoses specifically mentioned feline parvovirus; however, there was a case of calicivirus in the latter study.

In this more recent study, the platelet count is reported only once for each patient and no information regarding duration of the abnormality was gathered. No reports of platelet counts in a cat as high as Fig. 3 The relationship between thrombopoietin and platelet production. High Tpo levels lead to an increase in platelet mass. A greater platelet mass results in more Tpo being removed from circulation by the platelets. The resulting decrease in Tpo levels leads to a decrease in platelet mass and consequently an increase in Tpo. In health, Tpo is produced at a constant rate by hepatocytes; cytokines especially IL-6 stimulate increased production of Tpo   Fig. 4 Possible mechanisms contributing to the increase in platelet numbers in this cat. A transient thrombocytopenia resulting from feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) infection and interferon omega treatment leads to an increase in Tpo due to its decreased removal from circulation by the decreased platelet mass. IL-6 production caused by inflammation relating to FPV and FCV further increases Tpo levels which in turn leads to a large increase in platelet mass. A possible age-related sensitivity to Tpo may contribute to the extreme increase in platelets those recorded in the case here could be found. In humans, the majority of platelet counts in patients with reactive thrombocytosis are below 1,000\u00d710 9 /L, but counts higher than this have been reported (Buss et al. 1994 ).",

This cat was treated with interferon omega, which has been described as causing a mild and transient thrombocytopenia in clinical trials in cats (Information from European Medicines Agency Virbagen Omega Scientific Discussion 2009). The life span of platelets is 5-10 days and thus a decrease in platelet count to below normal levels would take longer to occur than neutropenia after a bone marrow insult (Stockham and Scott 2008) . It is possible that a transient thrombocytopenia was present after day 0 but before day 10 as a result of the parvovirus and/or interferon omega, but as no blood sample was taken during this time, this cannot be proven. Theoretically decreased platelet numbers would have resulted in an increase in Tpo levels as explained in Figs. 3 and 4 and a rebound thrombocytosis. Platelet numbers can increase rapidly-in a study concerning rats with induced thrombocytopenia, maximum rebound thrombocytosis (platelet count 1,720\u00d7 10 9 /L) occurred 4-5 days after the lowest platelet count (101\u00d710 9 /L) was recorded (Kimura et al. 1985) . Data from a splenectomized dog with a normal platelet count (377\u00d710 9 / L) pre-splenectomy and a platelet count of 1,197\u00d710 9 /L 1 day and 1,395\u00d710 9 /L 5 days post-splenectomy indicate that platelet numbers can increase greatly in a very short time and that an increase from a theoretical thrombocytopenia in the first few days following day 0 to a platelet count of 3,448\u00d710 9 /L on day 10 is plausible (Jain 1993) . However, it is probably unlikely that a thrombocytopenia alone would result in such high platelet numbers.",

Whether particularly high IL-6 levels are related to feline parvovirus or calicivirus infection is not known. The nonstructural protein (NS1) of human parvovirus B19 has been shown to directly cause increased expression and secretion of IL-6 (Hsu et al. 2006; Mitchell 2002) . Unfortunately, no assays for feline Tpo or IL-6 are commercially available, and although measurement of these substances may have been interesting, lack of reference data would make interpretation difficult.",

Interestingly, the blood samples of the littermate of this patient that displayed similar clinical signs and received the same treatment displayed only a mild thrombocytosis (700\u00d710 9 /L, Cell Dyn 3500, confirmed on blood smear) on hematological examination. Further reports of extreme thrombocytosis in young animals and subsequent to viral infections may be useful in explaining the findings documented here.",
