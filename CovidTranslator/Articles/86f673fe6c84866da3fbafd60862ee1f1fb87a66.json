Cryptosporidium was the most commonly detected pathogen, being found in 17% of patients, compared with reported rates of 13% in Burundi, 13 30% in Zaire s and 32% in Zambia. 14 Other protozoa associated with diarrhoeal illness were not detected in our study. We saw no cases of Isospora belli, a pathogen with marked variation in geographical distribution. 15 Nor, like other workers in Zambia, did we identify any cases of Giardia lamblia or Entamoeba. 16 A single patient yielded Enterocytozoon, the only microsporidian seen, and our low detection rate differed from other studies in Zimbabwe and Zambia. 9' 17 Although simple staining methods on unconcentrated stool samples have been shown to be effective, 9'15'17 small numbers may be revealed only after prolonged examination of preparations from at least two stool samples, and it is possible that more meticulous analysis would have yielded greater numbers. When profound weight loss is a feature of HIV-related illness in Africa it is often referred to as slim disease. 1 In our study chronic diarrhoea was the primary entry criterion, but as this is inextricably linked with wasting in many patients it was considered important to seek evidence of mycobacterial infection as a cause of wasting and M. tuberculosis was isolated from the faeces of 10 (13%) patients. Although these patients presented complaining of chronic diarrhoea, subsequent clinical evaluation identified five of these patients as likely to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and appropriate therapy was started. These five patients survived, providing further evidence that initially unrecognized tuberculosis may be a significant and treatable contributing factor to the wasting seen in slim disease. 1\u00b0 Nevertheless, in a further five patients who were stool culture positive for M. tuberculosis, tuberculosis was not diagnosed as a result of routine clinical procedures. Wasting may be the only noticable feature in a significant number of patients with tuberculosis; or it may be an agonal infection. Only one patient yielded Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, which was grown from a blood culture. Unlike EUrope and America, atypical mycobacterial infection is rarely seen in Nairobi. 12",

Careful diagnostic evaluation, in particular looking for pulmonary tuberculosis, should nevertheless be undertaken. Sputum (or stool) ZN microscopy for mycobacteria should be feasible almost everywhere and some patients with active tuberculosis will respond well to therapy. Stool microscopy using modified ZN staining can also identify cryptosporidium cysts, the presence of which is associated with a very limited prognosis. For such patients in the absence of effective therapy, it may be better to aim for symptomatic therapy and early discharge home as soon as the cysts are identified.",

Furthermore, as many as 20% of patients may be colonized with adherent E. coil, which may also play a role in pathogenesis and may respond to antibiotic treatment. To identify such infections requires access to a microbiology laboratory routinely performing culture and sensitivity testing. Unfortunately, few hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa can at present afford to provide such a service routinely because of severe resource constraints. Clinical trials focussing on these patients may be able to define more clearly signs and symptoms which predict bacterial infection without necessarily needing access to culture facilities, and thus more effectively identify a sub-group of patients with chronic diarrhoea for whom hospital admission and intensive antimicrobial therapy may be justified.",
