R0 is a widely used indicator of transmission potential in a totally susceptible population and is driven by the average contact rate and the mean infectious period of the disease (1). Yet, it only characterizes transmission potential at the onset of the epidemic and varies geographically for a given infectious disease according to local healthcare provision, outbreak response, as well as socioeconomic and cultural factors. Furthermore, estimating R0 requires information about the natural history of the infectious disease. Thus, our ability to estimate reproduction numbers for novel infectious diseases is hindered by the paucity of information about their epidemiological characteristics and transmission mechanisms. More informative metrics could synthesize real-time information about the extent to which the epidemic is expanding over time. Such metrics would be particularly useful if they rely on minimal data on the outbreak's trajectory (2). Scope and definition. We restricted our analysis to mainland China in this paper. A 'province' herein encompasses three different types of political sub-divisions of mainland China, namely, a province, a directly administered municipality (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin) and an autonomous region (Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet, and Xinjiang). Our analysis does not include the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region, which are under the effective rule of the People's Republic of China through the so-called 'One Country, Two Systems' political arrangements. Likewise, our analysis does not include Taiwan, which is de facto governed by a different government (the Republic of China).",

It would be interesting to investigate the evolution of the 84 doubling time after accounting for case importations if more detailed data becomes available. 85 To conclude, we observed an increasing trend in the epidemic doubling time of COVID-19 by 86 Chinese province from January 20 through February 9, 2020. The harmonic mean doubling time of 87 cumulative incidence in Hubei during the study period was short and estimated at 2.5 (95% CI, 2.4-2.7) 88 GC acknowledges support from NSF grant 1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and 99 Evolution of Infectious Diseases program.
