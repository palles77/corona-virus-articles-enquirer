Many of the studies are from a quantitative perspective which has given a wider but general coverage of study and analysis on the matters. However, the impacts of context, such as living environments and social culture, on recycling activities from a qualitative as well as in-depth perspective have seldom been discussed, especially in densely populated communities. Taking Hong Kong as an example, some food waste recycling (FWR) initiatives have been launched in housing estates. However, most projects have been suspended due to many practical problems. Only a few cases are still on-going. Physical setting quality has been identified as a significant factor affecting sustainable behaviour. Inefficient and low-quality public designs that do not consider living environments and specific lifestyles may fail to encourage community participation. This study aims to provide a more in-depth investigation into people's attitudes and actual behaviour towards and to shed light on public design for sustainability. Using the FWR programme in Amoy Gardens as a case, this study uses qualitative research methods to explore FWR experiences and improve its weaknesses. The findings show three potential challenges to FWR in densely populated high-rise buildings: (1) limited space, (2) hygiene issues and (3) implementation and management. This study also provides implications for public design to improve sustainability in communities and encourage public participation in FWR in high-density residential areas.",

Although some researchers have insisted that food waste can be transformed into a valuable resource, waste is most often perceived as a disgusting and annoying matter that must be eliminated as quickly as possible (Hawkins, 2006) . To get rid of massive food waste, incinerators and organic waste treatment facilities are built one after another. To deal with food waste issues, researchers and environmentalists have made tremendous efforts on policy and management initiatives. Various studies on waste management, norms and economic incentives have been conducted in recent decades (Chan and Lee, 2006; Chung and Poon, 1996; Fahy and Davies, 2007; Hage et al., 2009; Yau, 2010) . 'Pay as You Throw' has been identified as an effective policy contributing to waste recycling (Chang et al., 2008) . However, the impacts of context, such as living environments and social culture, on recycling activities and human behaviour have seldom been discussed, especially in densely populated communities. The quality of built environments and facilities has been identified as a significant factor affecting sustainable behaviour . Food waste generation is directly relevant to daily practices formed in specific environments (O'Brien, 2008) . Steg and Vlek (2009) also state that where people live, from dwellings to neighbourhoods and communities, can significantly influence sustainable behaviour.",

However, only few studies on public participation in household recycling have focused on particular medium-and high-density dwellings, which have been identified as problematic (Timlett and Williams, 2008) . Some reference to surveys of Asian countries, such as Korea and Japan, would facilitate public participation in food waste recycling (FWR). In some Korean neighbourhoods, food processors that can weigh food waste and charge a disposal fee are provided on the ground floor, urging residents to participate in FWR (Lee and Paik, 2011) . In Japan, different types of material, including food waste, are collected on a designated date. Residents have to store food waste at home and dispose of them according to a strict waste collection schedule . Any improper or illegal disposal behaviour results in punishment. Compared with Korea and Japan, the high-rise living situation in Hong Kong is much more crowded and diverse. Due to the high density of the population, most residents live in housing estates with more than 20 storeys. The limited private and public space makes it difficult to conduct food waste separation in residential areas.",

However, studies of design and living contexts that use qualitative methods, such as field observations and interviews, have been especially rare. The results of quantitative research can be used to gather major information with respects to respondents' beliefs, values and attitudes, however, they are not able to address how accurately or truthfully their behaviours and attitudes, and cannot address cause-and-effect relationship (Sommer and Sommer, 1997) . As Yin (1993) states, qualitative research can gain useful insights into the complexity of people's behaviours. Qualitative methods are important since they truly reveal the way people operate and the reasons behind their behaviour (de Certeau, 1984) .",

            "text": "In the past few decades, the Hong Kong government, environmentalists, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and some industries have made tremendous efforts to develop policies and measures on waste disposal and recycling. According to the report from the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) in 2010, the local government set out a 10-year waste disposal plan to develop new facilities and strategies in 1989. The Programme on the Source Separation of Domestic Waste has been implemented territory-wide in Hong Kong since 2005. It encourages people to separate recyclables from waste. Table 1 shows the key schemes, measures, programmes and legislations on food waste that have been launched by governments and NGOs. According to EPD (2011) , approximately 3600 t of food waste are generated every day, accounting for 42.3% of the amount of domestic waste. Two thirds of food waste come from households and one third comes from the commercial and industrial sectors. Compared with other materials, such as glass, metals, papers and plastics, the recovery rate of food waste is highly inefficient (0.6%). This low efficiency stems from the complexity and difficulty of FWR in high-rise buildings. Although the local government provides an ideal blueprint for handling the food waste problem, practical barriers make it difficult to effectively implement these strategies. Living environment and lifestyle are two major factors affecting FWR in residential areas (Siu and Lo, 2011) . Some new residential buildings provide processors in the kitchen to deal with food waste. However, for most residential buildings that have already been used for a few decades, there exist certain physical FWR constraints. Units are relatively small, especially public housing units (< 40.0 square metres). The limited space of domestic kitchens is no more than 2 square metres, which is not big enough to install any food waste processors. Previous studies have indicated that the cooking and consuming habits of local residents are quite different from those in Western countries (Siu and Lo, 2011) . In Hong Kong, people tend to buy fresh food from the wet market rather than frozen food from the supermarket. Their food waste contains a large quantity of water, which is putrescible and may lead to hygiene problems.",

It was a dark time in Hong Kong, but it triggered some positive changes. During this time of SARS outbreak, the government announced emergency measures, such as the cleaning and disinfection of public spaces in buildings.

Multiple viewpoints on a research question ensure greater accuracy of the judgments by collecting various data referring to the same phenomenon (Jick, 1979) . Data triangulation attempts to map out a phenomenon with different time and spatial dimensions to render the results easier to compare. Methodological triangulation requires to crosscheck data regarding the same phenomenon using multiple methods. In this study, data and methodological triangulation were used in two ways: (1) using different methods to examine the same situation. Non-participant observations and interviews were carried out in residential housing. Face-to-face interviews enable potential aspects to be revealed from the conversation (Gillham, 2000) ; and (2) using the same method in different situations.

Table 2 shows the content of interviews with different stakeholders. The semi-structured interviews with the residents included questions such as, 'Have you ever participated in the FWR programme?' 'How do you feel about the existing recycling activities in your community?' 'How do you deal with food waste in daily activities?' and 'Do you have any suggestions for improving public design for FWR?' The interviews with the district councillor and property management staff members also included questions such as 'Do you have any difficulties with the current FWR programme?' 'What are the challenges to implementation and management?' and 'Are you satisfied with the current settings for FWR?'. In the unstructured interviews, most of the questions were generated contemporaneously during the observations. The interviews were audio recorded. All of the participants were notified of this in advance. Nevertheless, some of the participants had concerns and were reluctant to be recorded. Others were uncomfortable and said they could not express their views freely when they realised that their interviews would be recorded. In these cases, notes were made to document their answers concurrent with or following the interview. The data collected from interviews were transcribed and then reproduced in a document. The layout of document was divided into two columns, which allowed for the researchers' notes and comments to be recorded in addition to participants' words. Both descriptive and In Vivo coding were adopted. The data and time were recorded to ensure each type of datum was stored in chronological order. Crouch and McKenzie (2006) propose that small sample size in a qualitative study helps the researcher to establish and maintain a close relationship with respondents and address the research problem in depth. The interviewees (N = 30) recruited for the study included the district councillor, two property management staff members and 27 residents. In qualitative research, it is suggested that sample sizes should reach saturation and no new major concepts emerge in the next interviews (Guest et al., 2006) . Examining the in-depth interviews conducted, we found that code saturation was reached at twelve interviews, whereby the range of major issues was identified. The sample of the respondents was by no mean representative; however, the diversity of socio-demography in terms of gender, age distribution, household income, education attainment was ensured. For interviewbased qualitative research, if anything is being 'sampled', it is regarded as 'case' rather than individual 'of a kind' (Crouch and McKenzie, 2006) . Therefore, one 'case' can provide new insights for the qualitative research (Frank, 1995) . According to the report of population census for Amoy Gardens from Census and Statistics Department (CSD), 71.62% of the population were 25-64 years old. In terms of educational attainment, 35.46% had a tertiary degree and 45.48% had a secondary degree. In terms of the economic activity status, 61.88% were employed while 16.48% were retired or unemployed (CSD, 2011). The distribution of the sample in this study was similar to those in Amoy Gardens. The participants were randomly selected at different times. 21 respondents were employed full/part time, 6 were unemployed or retired and 3 were students. 16 participants had an income between HK $10,000 and HK$39,999 and 13 had an income of HK$40,000 or above. 13 had a tertiary degree and 5 had a primary or lower degree (Table 3 43.33% of the respondents participated in FWR programme. Each interview generally lasted from 30 to 45 min. Some of the respondents were interviewed twice or more at different stages of the research. The residents who participated in the FWR programme sorted food waste at home every day using their own containers or plastic bags. Food waste collection was organised from 8 pm to 10 pm every evening. As the collection point was located on the podium, most of the participants from different storeys had to take elevators and walk for some distance. Several buckets were provided on the podium to collect food waste.",

However, many factors such as safety and space affect the systematic or effective implementation of food waste collection in public spaces.

Effective management and maintenance of public design can lead to long-term recycling and social collaboration. Clearly, high-quality and efficient public design is vital to the success of the FWR programme. However, attitudes and opinions from different stakeholders should be addressed in advance.

            "text": "Furthermore, this study indicates that improving public design for collaboration is an alternative way of facilitating behavioural change. The approach, which includes sorting, collecting and gardening, can be described as active or 'from passive to active' strategy. It is a potential approach for increasing residents' motivation to FWR in high-rise buildings. Only when people have a close connection with the community do they care about their surroundings and become keen to participate in community recycling activities. This paper suggests that public design encompassing built environments and facilities can be utilised to enhance collaboration and establish community networks, which help influence sustainable behaviour. Future research would have been more convincing if proposed approach can be examined through more empirical studies in similar areas. J.X. Xiao, K.W.M.
