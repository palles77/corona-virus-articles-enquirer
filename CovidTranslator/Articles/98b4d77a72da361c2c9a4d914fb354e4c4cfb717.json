Data sets are from three overlapping six-year periods: . The methodologies of co-citation clustering, mapping, and string formation are reviewed, and a measure of cluster currency is defined as the average age of highly cited papers relative to the year span of the data set. An association is found between the currency variable in a prior period and the percentage change in cluster size and citation frequency in the following period. The conflating factor of \"single-issue clusters\" is discussed and dealt with using a new metric called in-group citation.",

It has been argued elsewhere (SMALL, 2004 ) that citation and cocitation patterns reflect a socialization process in science involving specialists coming to consensus on what documents are important and how they relate to one another. Cited works stand for or symbolize ideas or methods, and co-citation then defines a relation between these ideas. The method involves, in a nutshell, using highly cited papers, defined as the top one percent (1%) of papers in each of 22 broad disciplines, as the units of analysis (for the field definitions used see: http://www.in-cites.com/fielddef.html). We assemble these units into co-citation networks through a series of clustering operations, yielding clusters at various levels of aggregation. We then track these objects over time by looking at successive time slices of data to determine the pattern of continuing highly cited papers from one set to the next. The threads of continuity are referred to as cluster strings (SMALL, 1977) .",

Both cited and citing items are restricted to these time spans. All co-citations among the selected highly cited papers are computed, each pair defining a link. To perform clustering, a threshold is set on the normalized co-citation coefficient (cosine similarity) which determines the selection of linked papers. The single-link cluster analysis gathers together the links that share common papers. To prevent chaining, a maximum cluster size is set with a provision for re-clustering at a higher threshold (SMALL & SWEENEY, 1985) . Table 1 gives statistics on the three data sets used: the number of clusters, highly cited papers, average citations per paper, and average publication year of papers. Once a cluster of co-cited documents is formed, a map or visualization can be created. Visualization provides a means of exploring the structure of the set of documents and for suggesting interpretations. All spatial solutions involving a reduction of dimensions are approximations, and thus maps are suggestive rather than definitive. On these maps the area of the circle is proportional to the citation frequency of the paper and the arrangement of circles reflects an attempt to minimize the net force on each node. Each co-citation link is modeled as an attractive force proportional to the normalized co-citation which varies linearly with distance between nodes (FRUCHTERMAN & REINGOLD, 1991) . In addition there is a repulsive force among all nodes varying as the inverse square of the distance. Nodes are moved iteratively to minimize the forces acting on them, giving an average residual force per node after each iteration. For a front of 30 or so papers there might be a few hundred co-citation links that go into determining node positions. However, for clarity only the strongest links for each node are displayed, and dotted lines are used to represent a minimal spanning tree between any remaining separate components. Figure 1 shows a map for a cluster on webometrics from the period 1997-2002 containing 13 papers. Papers from the most recent year (2001) are darker in color. After a mapping is carried out in one time period, change over time is studied by moving the time frame period by period, and tracking the highly cited papers from one period to the next. Cluster strings are formed when clusters in successive time periods share common papers.",

To see the structure of larger fields or disciplines, we carry out another clustering and mapping process. Higher level structure is obtained by treating each initial level cluster as an object, re-computing the links between pairs of these objects, and re-clustering. This provides a telescoping of levels progressing from documents to specialties to disciplines, in a hierarchical schema. Not all first level objects have links to other objects at that level, reflecting differing degrees of isolation of research areas. It is possible to reintroduce isolates at each higher level to improve recall. To illustrate a hierarchy we start with a cluster on carbon nanotubes shown in Figure 3 . Topics covered in the map are the solubilization of carbon nanotubes Scientometrics 68 (2006) in the middle of the map, optical properties at the upper left, polymer wrapping at the upper right, fluorination at the lower right and sidewall functionalization at the lower left. Treating this group as a single object and collapsing its nodes, we compute its links to other objects at the same level. With another iteration of clustering the subject matter broadens, identifying a group of specialized areas in nanoscience generally (Figure 4 ), containing the above nanotube cluster as a single circle.",

On this third level map the network consists of second level objects and the spread of topics is closer to what might be called materials science. We find regions dealing with molecular machines, multilayer films, block copolymers, catalysis, crystals, synthetic chemistry, and DNA as an electronic device. Nanoscience from the previous figure is the large circle on the lower left connected above to molecular machines and DNA computing.

The right side of Figure 8 shows the number of strings of different size, that is, the number of first level clusters in the string. Focusing on strings of size three, the left-hand side of Figure 8 shows the different developmental forms possible, with 95% continuing in a simple linear fashion across time. Linear sequences comprise 83% of all 3,651 strings in the three time periods, including strings of two clusters which are by definition linear.

Five of the seven largest strings are from the physical sciences, and two are from biology. Three of the physical science areas are oriented to applied physics and engineering: molecular machines, vertical-cavity lasers, and plasma mass spectrometry. As an example of a complex string, Alzheimer's disease (the third in the list of Table 3 ) shows the sudden emergence of a new area in 2002, consisting of 21 papers on the role of the presenilin-gamma-secretase complex (Figure 9 ).

To compile these data, the clusters were aggregated by year within each string, summing their sizes and total citations, and computing the average publication year for the pooled set of papers in the year. The first column in Table 5 is the currency range. The second column is the number of consecutive year-to-year transitions. The third column is the average percentage increase in string size (number of highly cited papers) from one period to the next. The fifth column is the mean currency of the later year. The last column is the percentage change in total citations. We see for example that strings with a currency between 0.8 and 1.0, of which there are 616 cases, have an average percentage increase in highly cited papers of 35.4% and an increase of 306.8% in total citations, while strings having a currency 0.2 or less decline in size by an average of 11% and have only a 5.3% increase in citations. The results suggest that strings with higher prior year currency have a larger percentage increase in size the next year than strings with lower prior year currency. Even more dramatic is the increase in citations for strings with high prior year currency.

The latter would be expected to grow only if it experienced rejuvenation through new findings or grew though a merger or combination with other older areas. A measure of currency is defined as the average publication year normalized with respect to the year span of the data set. The percentage increase in year-to-year cluster size was then compared with various ranges of the prior-year currency measure. The result was a slight tendency for clusters of high currency to grow more rapidly the following year Scientometrics 68 (2006) than clusters of low currency, but the overall correlation was low. Thus, currency has some limited value as a short term predictor of year to year growth. Further work will be needed to identify other factors that might contribute to short term growth, and to understand the longer term dynamics of research areas.",
