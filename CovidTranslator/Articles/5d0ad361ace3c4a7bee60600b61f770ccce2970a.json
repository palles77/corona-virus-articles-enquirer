Most of the novel compounds inhibited the wt ion channel in the low micromolar range. Of note, several compounds inhibited the A/M2 V27A mutant ion channel, one of them with submicromolar IC 50 . None of the compounds was found to inhibit the S31N mutant ion channel.

            "text": "The influenza A virus M2 protein is a 97 residues long integral membrane protein with a transmembrane (TM) domain of 19 residues, a small ectodomain of 23 residues, and a 54 residues long cytoplasmic tail. 1 This M2 protein is encoded by a spliced mRNA derived from viral RNA segment 7. 2 The A/M2 proton channel activity is required for viral replication. 3 Influenza A virus particles enter the host cells by endocytosis (mainly via the clathrin-mediated route). 4 Within the endosome, release of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNPs) complexes from the matrix M1 protein, depends on acidification of the viral interior. This lowering of the pH is accomplished by the M2 proton channel, which facilitates the flow of protons from the acidic endosomal lumen into the interior of the virion. 5 This proton channel function of M2 has been found to be essential in all influenza A subtypes thus far studied. In some virus strains, e.g. H7N1 fowl plague virus, the A/M2 protein also equilibrates the pH of the trans-Golgi network to prevent a premature conformational change of the viral hemagglutinin (HA). 6 Influenza A viruses are important pathogens which are capable of causing significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Two classes of anti-viral drugs are currently available: the M2 ion channel inhibitors [amantadine (Amt) and rimantadine] and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). 6 However, the usefulness of Amt and rimantadine dropped sharply in recent years due to the widespread of resistant viruses, which prompted the Centers for Disease Control to recommend discontinuing the use of Amt-based drugs. [7] [8] Also, resistance to oseltamivir has been frequently observed in recent flu seasons. 9-10 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop the next generation of antiviral drugs that are active against drugresistant influenza viruses. Systematic mutational analysis of the pore-line residues of the A/M2 TM domain identified many Amt-resistance mutations. 11 However, only a few of these mutations (i.e. L26F, V27A, and S31N) have been observed in transmissible viruses, with the S31N mutation being the most frequently occurring Amt-resistance mutation. 12 The channel properties (ion selectivity and activity) of these mutants appear to be very similar to those of the wt M2 channel, suggesting that the channel properties need to be finely tuned in order for the virus to be transmissible.",

For example, Wang et al. reported several spiro compounds, such as 1-3. Spiroadamantane 3 inhibits the L26F and V27A A/M2 mutants with good efficacy in electrophysiological and virus plaque reduction assays. [13] [14] [15] Most recently, this group also discovered new compounds, such as 4 and 5, that inhibit the most prevalent drug-resistant A/M2 mutant, S31N (Chart 1). [16] [17] [18] In this study, we report some novel scaffolds designed to inhibit the A/M2 channel. Several pyrrolidine derivatives were found to inhibit the wt channel as well as the M2-V27A mutant ion channel. The best compound, guanidine 16d, has a low micromolar activity against the wt channel (IC 50 = 3.4 \u03bcM) and submicromolar activity against the M2-V27A mutant (IC 50 = 0.29 \u03bcM).",

            "text": "During the past years, our group has synthesized several polycyclic Amt analogs containing different scaffolds, including ring-contracted, ring-rearranged and 2,2-dialkyl derivatives of Amt (Chart 2). [19] [20] [21] [22] Several ring-contracted analogs of Amt, such as amines 6 and 7 were evaluated for inhibition of A/M2 proton channel activity, by using the conductance assay in M2-expressing oocytes. They displayed similar IC 50 values for wt A/M2 as Amt, but, unfortunately, were inactive against the Amt-resistant S31N or V27A mutant forms of A/ M2. 20 We have also explored the activity of larger, ring-rearranged analogs of Amt using the pentacyclo[6.4.0.0 2,10 .0 3,7 .0 4, 9 ] dodecane scaffold. Very interestingly, while primary amines 8 and 9 and several derivatives, including secondary and tertiary amines, amidines and guanidines did not inhibit A/M2 proton channel activity, the conformationally more rigid pyrrolidine-based derivatives 10 and 11 did show a promising activity against the wt A/M2 channel, being only slightly less active than Amt. Moreover, while the primary amines 8 and 9 did not show any activity against the V27A mutant form of A/M2, both pyrrolidine derivatives showed a marginal activity against this mutant (Table 1) . 20, 22 Based on these promising results, we reasoned that the synthesis of pyrrolidine analogs of the already active bisnoradamantane 7, featuring an unprecedented 3azatetracyclo[5.2.1.1 5, 8 .0 1,5 ]undecane ring, may lead to compounds with higher activity against the wt and the V27A mutant of A/M2.",

It has been suggested that in designing Amt analogs, pyrrolidine or piperidine derivatives may result in a more favorable orientation inside the M2 channel pore as compared to freely rotating alkylamine chains. 33 Thus, we had previously tested tetracyclic derivatives 8 and 9 and conformationally more rigid amines 10 and 11 (Table 1) . 20 In sharp contrast with the poor performance of primary amines 8 and 9, diene 10 was shown to be able to inhibit wt A/M2 channel by more than 80%, showing an IC 50 of 33.5 \u03bcM. Biscyclopropanation slightly increased the potency, since derivative 11 showed an IC 50 of 24.0 \u03bcM. Interestingly, 11 (at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM) inhibited the A/M2 V27A channel activity by 17.7%, which is superior to Amt (10.8%), yet much less than 1-3. [13] [14] [15] Based on these results, we synthesized compounds 14a, 15a and 16a, as conformationally more rigid analogs of 7. In agreement with the previous trend observed in going from 8 and 9 to 10 and 11, pyrrolidines 14a and 16a were potent inhibitors of the wt channel (IC 50 of 9.7 and 6.1 \u03bcM, respectively) and, very interestingly, were better inhibitors of the V27A mutant channel than 7, with the guanidine 16a showing an IC 50 of 11.4 \u03bcM.

A peptide spanning the transmembrane domain (22-46) of M2, designated as M2TM, was reconstituted in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles in a 1:50 peptide to detergent ratio, under which condition M2TM forms tetramer predominantly. 16d was titrated into the solution and the characteristic peak of W41 H \u03b51 was monitored in 1D 1 H-NMR ( Figure S1 ). It was found that drug-bound form of M2 is in slow exchange with the apo-form: a new peak at 10.9 ppm, corresponding to W41 H \u03b51 , emerges upon drug addition and continuously increases with drug titration while the peak at 10.4 ppm associated with the apo-form becomes weaker. Previously, we observed that this peak correlates with the binding of drugs to the pore of the channel. 34 A plot of the peak integral at 10.9 ppm against increasing drug concentrations is shown in Figure 1 . The data were fitted using the nonlinear least-squares fitting equation as described earlier. 34 The best fit gave a stoichiometry ratio of 1.37 \u00b1 0.28 drug per tetramer and a dissociation constant K d of 40 \u00b1 24 \u03bcM. It should be noted that the titration was conducted at a protein concentration (1.6 mM) that is significantly above K d , thus the actual K d is difficult to be determined. However, theoretical curve fittings with fixed stoichiometry (N=1, meaning one drug per tetramer binding) and different K d (4 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM, and 400 \u03bcM) showed the K d to be significantly less than 100 \u03bcM (see Figure 1 ).",

When the addition was finished, the solution was heated under reflux for 72 h. The mixture was cooled to 0 \u00b0C (ice-water bath), treated with 30% aq solution of KOH til basic pH and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous one was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (3\u00d730 mL). The combined organic layers were dried with anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated in vacuo to give amine 14c as an orange oil (326 mg). The amine was dissolved in methanol (5 mL) and treated with (2R,3R)-tartaric acid (170 mg, 1.13 mmol) dissolved in the minimum amount of methanol. The mixture was concentrated in vacuo to yield 14c as its (2R,3R)-tartrate as a yellow solid (459 mg, 33% yield). An analytical sample of 14c\u2022(2R, 3R)-tartrate was obtained by crystallization from MeOH/Et 2 O, mp 165-166 \u00b0C.

Normalized peak volume of the W41 H \u03b51 in the drug-bound form was plotted as a function of 16d concentration. The fitting yields a stoichiometry ratio of 1.37 \u00b1 0.28 drug/tetramer with a K d of 40 \u00b1 24 \u03bcM (curve shown in blue). In comparison, theoretical curve fittings with fixed stoichiometry (N=1) and K d of 4 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM and 400 \u03bcM are shown in red, green, and pink, respectively.
