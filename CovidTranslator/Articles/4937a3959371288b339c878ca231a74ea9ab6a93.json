In most cases, CoVs cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory illness with symptoms including runny nose, cough, sore throat, and fever (http://www.cdc.gov/ coronavirus/about/). However, some CoVs can cause severe illness. In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) caused a severe global outbreak in humans, particularly in China, indicating that this virus may cause interspecies transmission and lead to epidemic disease. Thus, research on CoVs has greatly increased since 2003 owing to the high morbidity and mortality of SARS in humans. In 2012, the occurrence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) was first reported in the Middle East and subsequently spread to other areas, such as South Korea and Hong Kong. The common clinical symptoms of SARS and MERS include persistent fever, cough, chills, dyspnea, and headache. Additionally, these two HCoVs are both characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia. Patients who contract SARS or MERS often die of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and diabetes. Moreover, CoVs have attracted great attention owing to the recent humanto-human transmission of MERS-CoV in South Korea, with a fatality rate four times higher than that of SARS-CoV (Durai et al., 2015) . Many factors have blocked the prevention and control of these new epidemic diseases, including its rapid worldwide distribution, extensive genetic diversity, high rates of mutation and recombination, and lack of an effective vaccine or methods for treatment and prevention.",

In November 2002, an unusual atypical pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV first occurred in Foshan City Guangdong Province, China (Cheng et al., 2007) , and the virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a 65-year-old doctor who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou. Subsequently, the infection spread to more than 30 different countries, including North America, Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia, resulting in a global outbreak with 8096 cases and 774 deaths. The fatality rate was nearly 10% in 2002-2003, having substantial economic effects (Drosten et al., 2003) . Investigation of live-animal markets in China indicated that the animal-to-human interface provided a mechanism for SARS-CoV to adapt to human-to-human transmission. SARS has been recognized as a global threat; although the outbreak of SARS was halted in 2004 through epidemiological measures, recent identification of bat SARS-like CoVs that can recognize human angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and replicate efficiently in primate cells indicates the inevitability of a SARS-CoV-like virus reemergence event in the near future (Guan et al., 2003) .",

As of October 30, 2015, 1618 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection have been reported; of these, 579 died. Many patients with MERS develop acute renal failure. The fatality rate of MERS-CoV (up to 40%) seems higher than that of SARS-CoV (nearly 10%).

Among these proteins, nucleocapsid (N) proteins and spike (S) proteins are promising targets for antivirals (Lin et al., 2014; Monod et al., 2015) . The S protein S2 subunit is required for MERS-CoV membrane fusion. HR2P, a peptide isolated from heptad repeat (HR) 2 in S2 subunit, blocks MERS-CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion. HR2P-2M, a type of HR2P analog, has been tested in mice; the results indicated that its efficiency was increased when combined with IFN-\u03b2 treatment (Channappanavar et al., 2015) . Recent studies have suggest that papain-like protease (PL pro ) and 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) are also promising antiviral targets because they are crucial for viral protein processing and RNA replication (Tomar et al., 2015) . For nonstructural protein targets, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Nsp12, the triphosphatase Nsp13, the ribonucleases Nsp14 and Nsp15, and the RNA-cap methyltransferases Nsp14 and Nsp16, can be used for designing drugs (Subissi et al., 2014) . However, it may take a long time for these compounds to be applied in the clinical setting.",

The presence of a long-lived neutralizing antibody in convalescent SARS patients indicates that it is possible to use vaccination for the control and prevention of CoV. Currently, vaccines, including recombinant-protein vaccines, recombinant vectored vaccines, and inactivated whole-virus vaccines, are developed and tested in laboratories (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013) . Recent studies have suggested that MERS-CoV RBD binds to its receptor and induces potent humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, indicating that this protein may be a promising target for the development of a subunit vaccine (Zhou et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015) . An exceptionally potent germlinelike antibody, m336, was proven to be relatively quick and effective for MERS-CoV in vivo (Ying et al., 2015) . Additionally, a recently reported orthopoxvirus-based vaccine was shown to reduce virus excretion after MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels (Haagmans et al., 2016) , and to provide protection against camelpox. This vaccine may be useful in high-risk populations, such as health care workers and people who frequently come in contact with camels. According to the One Health concept, animal vaccines may play a crucial role in the control of HCoVs owing to their potential to block animal-to-human transmission.",

With the rapidly increasing diversity of animal CoV species, particularly bats, the likelihood of recombination may increase the chance for CoVs to continue to spill over from zoonotic sources into the human population. The recent outbreak of MERS is a timely reminder of the importance of coronavirus as a deadly human respiratory tract pathogen for the global health community. To date, six HCoVs have been identified and sequenced. However, the exact mechanism of species-to-species spread of HCoVs remains unclear. Moreover, there are no available vaccines for prevention of HCoV infection. Thus, close surveillance of the host (intermediate host) appears to be necessary for identification of novel pathogens and control of HCoVs. The One Health approach should considered for further prevention of HCoVs, and collaboration and cooperation with international organizations and national and local governments are required to respond to emerging and re-emerging CoVs.",
