Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of co-infection, isolated in 47 (9.3%) patients. Characteristics independently associated with the development of bacterial coinfection of adult patients in a logistic regression model included the absence of cardiovascular disease (OR 0.41 [0.23-0.73], p = 0.003), leukocytosis (>11 K/l, OR 3.7 [2.2-6.2], p < 0.001; reference: normal WBC 3.5-11 K/l) at ICU admission and a higher ICU admission SOFA score (for each increase by 1 in SOFA score, OR 1.1 [1.0-1.2], p = 0.001). Bacterial co-infections (OR 2.2 [1.4-3.6] , p = 0.001) and viral co-infections (OR 3.1 [1.3-7.4 ], p = 0.010) were both associated with death in bivariable analysis. Patients with a bacterial co-infection had a longer hospital stay, a longer ICU stay and were likely to have had a greater delay in the initiation of antiviral administration than patients without co-infection (p < 0.05) in bivariable analysis. Conclusions: Bacterial co-infections were common, resulted in delay of antiviral therapy and were associated with increased resource allocation and higher mortality.",

They resulted in increased resource allocation, as defined by longer hospital and ICU stay, although this was not significant when accounting for admission SOFA score.

This supports the idea that S. aureus has a synergistic relationship with influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, even for people in the community.

Our rates were lower than those reported in the 2009-2010 season. During that pandemic year, rates of 17.5-25% for community-acquired co-infections and 33% for combined community-and hospital-acquired co-infections were reported although the criteria for defining a co-infected patient varied by study [18] [19] [20] . Four (25%) out of 12 autopsies in our cohort showed evidence of bacterial pneumonia, but one of these four patients did not have a positive culture despite collection of respiratory and blood cultures. Our recorded 30-day incidence of bacterial co-infection may therefore be an underestimate, reflecting the poor sensitivity of lower respiratory cultures in the setting of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Bacterial co-infection was associated with higher mortality. This is despite the fact that 92.1% of our cohort received antibacterial drugs during hospitalization. The pathogenesis of influenza and bacterial co-infection is synergistic and complex. The disease process involves numerous viral and bacterial virulence factors interacting with the host immune system and adversely affecting respiratory physiology. In pandemic seasons, compared with usual epidemic seasons, a high proportion of the mortality from influenza infection, often complicated by bacterial co-infection, occurs in young, previously healthy people as a result of an aberrant immune response to the virus [23] .",

In studies evaluating the agents of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia without an underlying influenza infection, 14-28% have been attributed to S. aureus, 16-34% have been attributed to P. aeruginosa and 19-35% have been attributed to Enterobacteriaceae [25] .
