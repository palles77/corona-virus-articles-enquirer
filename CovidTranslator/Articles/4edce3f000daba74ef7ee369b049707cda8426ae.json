As of 10 March, 2020, COVID-19 has infected >100 000 people globally and caused thousands of deaths. [1] As of early March 2020, Canada has detected several dozen cases, most of them in returning international travellers or their close contacts. [2] Given that pneumonia is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, the emergence and global spread of COVID-19 has raised concerns about the implications of this outbreak for pregnant women and their fetuses. Pregnant women and their loved ones will be looking to maternal care providers for information and guidance on how to prevent or manage infection with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Due to physiologic changes that occur in pregnancy, when compared with their non-pregnant counterparts, pregnant women with lower respiratory tract infections often experience worse outcomes, including higher rates of hospital and intensive care unit admission. [3] Since 2002 there have been two other global outbreaks of highly-pathogenic coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While SARS and MERS are not identical to SARS-CoV-2 in their genetic structures or clinical manifestations, the recent outbreaks of these viruses may provide insights on the effects of COVID-19 in the context of pregnancy. The literature on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are limited to a handful of case reports and series. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Many of these cases involved severe morbidity including the need for intensive care and cardiorespiratory support. Notably, there were cases of maternal mortality associated with SARS and MERS infection. The only published case-control study showed that pregnant women with SARS experienced worse outcomes than nonpregnant women of similar age. [10] Reports varied with respect to the effects of SARS and MERS on pregnancy outcomes. Spontaneous abortion has been reported among women infected with SARS and MERS in the first trimester.4 As well, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth have been reported in pregnancies affected by SARS and MERS in the second and third trimesters. [4, 9] It is important to note, however, that a number of pregnancies had good outcomes despite maternal infection with SARS or MERS. [6, 7, 8] Broadly speaking, and drawing upon our knowledge of other respiratory illnesses in pregnancy, adverse It remains to be seen whether the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their fetuses will be similar to those of SARS and MERS. To date, the reported case-fatality rate for the general population infected with COVID-19 is lower than that of either SARS or MERS (estimated at 1%-2% vs. 9%-10% and 35%-40%, respectively). Similarly, by now, there have been over 60 cases of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 in China and the vast majority of these women have had mild to moderate pneumonia. [11, 12, 13, 14] To date here has been one case of severe maternal morbidity secondary to COVID-19 reported. [12] This 31-year-old woman was infected at 34 weeks gestation and went on to experience severe respiratory compromise and multi-organ dysfunction requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The pregnancy outcomes of the reported cases have been largely good, [11, 12, 13] with spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour being the most commonly reported adverse pregnancy outcomes. One stillbirth has been reported and this occurred in the case of severe maternal illness reported by Liu et al. [12] Given the limited data, it is too early to determine if higher rates of adverse outcomes are expected in pregnant women infected with COVID-19. As with SARS and MERS, pregnancy outcomes are likely to be strongly correlated with degree of maternal illness. [12] There has been no evidence of vertical (mother-to-infant) transmission found in any cases of SARS, MERS, or COVID-19. Additionally, analyses of amniotic fluid, serum, placenta, and breastmilk from pregnant women confirmed to have SARS or COVID-19 infection have found no detectable viral RNA, [8, 13] further supporting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Importantly, maternal infection with SARS, MERS, or COVID-19 has not been associated with teratogenicity. However, because of the small number of reported cases of infection during the first trimester (when embryogenesis occurs), risk of congenital anomaly associated with COVID-19 cannot be completely excluded.",

However, depending on a family's values and availability of resources they may choose to separate infant from mother until isolation precautions for the mother can be formally discontinued. \uf0b7 Women should practice good handwashing before and wear a mask while providing infant care. \uf0b7 Women who choose to breastfeed should be allowed to do so after appropriate handwashing and while wearing a mask. It is possible that the mother can transmit antibodies to the infant through breastmilk; however, there is limited evidence of this transmission and the potential benefits are unclear.",

As with any epidemic, data are evolving and a measured approach to management is required. Based on this evidence to date on COVID-19 as well as the literature on outbreaks of SARS, MERS and other emerging pathogens, the SOGC's Infectious Disease Committee has created this committee opinion to help guide maternity care providers in the care of pregnant women. This guidance is based on the evidence to date and will continue to be updated as more information emerges. * Decisions related to separation of mother and baby, breastfeeding, and delayed cord clamping should be made in collaboration with the patient and her family and take into consideration available evidence and patient's values.",
