Nucleotide sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis have been used to explore molecular determinants of virulence in many different viruses. Specific sequences and structures found only in disease-causing strains of viruses and not in closely related attenuated or avirulent strains have been identified. Sequence analysis has also led to the identification of T-cell and B-cell epitopes on virus proteins responsible for their recognition by the immune system. Unfortunately, these advances do not automatically lead to an understanding of the mechanisms responsible for pathogenicity.",

Virus replication sequesters cellular BOX 7.1. DON'T BLAME THE VIRUSES! Virus pathogenesis is an abnormal and fairly rare situation. The majority of virus infections are silent and do not result in any outward signs of disease. It is sometimes said that viruses would disappear if they killed their hosts. This is not necessarily true. It is possible to imagine viruses with a hit-and-run strategy, moving quickly from one dying host to the next and relying on continuing circulation for their survival. Nevertheless, there is a clear tendency for viruses not to injure their hosts if possible. A good example of this is the rabies virus. The symptoms of human rabies virus infections are truly dreadful, but thankfully rare. In its normal hosts (e.g., foxes), rabies virus infection produces a much milder disease that does not usually kill the animal. Humans are an unnatural, dead-end host for this virus, and the severity of human rabies is as extreme as the condition is rare.",

Eukaryotic cells must carry out constant macromolecular synthesis, whether they are growing and dividing or in a state of quiescence. A growing cell clearly needs to manufacture more proteins, more nucleic acids, and more of all of its components to increase its size before dividing. However, there is a more fundamental requirement for such continuous activity. The function of all cells is regulated by controlled expression of their genetic information and the subsequent degradation of the molecules produced. Such control relies on a delicate and dynamic balance between synthesis and decay, which determines the intracellular levels of all the important molecules in the cell. This is particularly true of the control of the cell cycle, which determines the behavior of dividing cells (see \"Cell Transformation by DNA Viruses,\" later). In general terms, a number of common phenotypic changes can be recognized in virus-infected cells. These changes are often referred to as the cytopathic effects (c.p.e.) of a virus, and include: n Altered shape: Adherent cells that are normally attached to other cells (in vivo) or an artificial substrate (in vitro) may assume a rounded shape different from their normal flattened appearance. The extended processes (extensions of the cell surface resembling tendrils) involved in attachment or mobility are withdrawn into the cell. n Detachment from the substrate: For adherent cells, this is the stage of cell damage that follows that just described. Both of these effects are caused by partial degradation or disruption of the cytoskeleton that is normally responsible for maintaining the shape of the cell. n Lysis: This is the most extreme case, where the entire cell breaks down. Membrane integrity is lost, and the cell may swell due to the absorption of extracellular fluid and finally break open. This is an extreme case of cell damage, and it is important to realize that not all viruses induce this effect, although they may cause other cytopathic effects. Lysis is beneficial to a virus in that it provides an obvious method of releasing new virus particles from an infected cell; however, there are alternative ways of achieving this, such as release by budding (Chapter 4). n Membrane fusion: The membranes of adjacent cells fuse, resulting in a mass of cytoplasm containing more than one nucleus, known as a syncytium, or, depending on the number of cells that merge, a giant cell. Fused cells are short lived and subsequently lysedapart from direct effects of the virus, they cannot tolerate more than one nonsynchronized nucleus per cell. n Membrane permeability: A number of viruses cause an increase in membrane permeability, allowing an influx of extracellular ions such as sodium. Translation of some virus mRNAs is resistant to high concentrations of sodium ions, permitting the expression of virus genes at the expense of cellular messages. n Inclusion bodies: These are areas of the cell where virus components have accumulated. They are frequently sites of virus assembly, and some cellular inclusions consist of crystalline arrays of virus particles. It is not clear how these structures damage the cell, but they are frequently associated with viruses that cause cell lysis, such as herpesviruses and rabies virus.",

A number of viruses that cause cell lysis exhibit a phenomenon known as shutoff early in infection. Shutoff is the sudden and dramatic cessation of most host-cell macromolecular synthesis. In poliovirus-infected cells, shutoff is the result of production of the virus 2A protein. This molecule is a protease that cleaves the p220 component of eIF-4F, a complex of proteins required for cap-dependent translation of messenger RNAs by ribosomes. Because poliovirus RNA does not have a 5 0 methylated cap but is modified by the addition of the VPg protein, virus RNA continues to be translated. In poliovirus-infected cells, the dissociation of mRNAs and polyribosomes from the cytoskeleton can be observed, and this is the reason for the inability of the cell to translate its own messages. A few hours after translation ceases, lysis of the cell occurs.",

In the case of adenoviruses, the penton protein (part of the virus capsid) has a toxic effect on cells. Although its precise action on cells is not known, addition of purified penton protein to cultured cells results in their rapid death. Toxin production by pathogenic bacteria is a common phenomenon, but this is the only well-established case of a virus-encoded molecule with a toxinlike action. However, some of the normal contents of cells released on lysis may have toxic effects on other cells, and antigens that are not recognized as self by the body (e.g., nuclear proteins) may result in immune activation and inflammation. The adenovirus E3e11.6K protein is synthesized in small amounts from the E3 promoter at early stages of infection and in large amounts from the major late promoter at late stages of infection (Chapter 5). It has recently been shown that E3e11.6K is required for the lysis of adenovirus-infected cells and the release of virus particles from the nucleus.",

While some herpesviruses such as HSV are highly cytopathic, most of the lymphotropic herpesviruses do not cause a significant degree of cellular injury. However, infection of the delicate cells of the immune system may perturb their normal function. Because the immune system is internally regulated by complex networks of interlinking signals, relatively small changes in cellular function can result in its collapse. Alteration of the normal pattern of production of cytokines could have profound effects on immune function.

A number of similar lentiviruses cause immunodeficiency diseases in animals. Unlike infection by other types of retrovirus, HIV infection does not directly result in the formation of tumors. Some tumors such as B-cell lymphomas are sometimes seen in AIDS patients, but these are a consequence of the lack of immune surveillance that is responsible for the destruction of tumors in healthy individuals. The clinical course of AIDS is long and very variable. A great number of different abnormalities of the immune system are seen in AIDS. As a result of the biology of lentivirus infections, the pathogenesis of AIDS is highly complex (Figure 7 .2). It is still not clear how much of the pathology of AIDS is caused directly by the virus and how much is caused by the immune system. Numerous models have been suggested to explain how HIV causes immunodeficiency. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and indeed it is probable that the underlying loss of CD4 \u00fe cells (see Chapter 6) in AIDS is complex and multifactorial.

Soon after HIV was discovered in the 1980s it was shown that the virus could kill CD4 \u00fe cells in culture. Early experiments suggested there might not be enough virus present in AIDS patients to account for all the cell loss seen. More recently, sensitive PCR techniques suggest that with the amount of virus now known to be present in infected individuals, the CD4 \u00fe cell count should in fact decline much faster and AIDS develop much earlier than it does after HIV infection. Researchers have used a \"tap and drain\" analogy to describe CD4 \u00fe cell loss in HIV infection. In this description of the disease, CD4 \u00fe cells (like water in a sink) are constantly being eliminated by HIV (the drain), while the body is constantly replacing them with new ones (the tap). Over time, the tap cannot keep up with the drain, and CD4 \u00fe counts begin to drop, leaving the body susceptible to the infections that define AIDS. CD4 \u00fe cells that are activated in response to invading microbes (including HIV itself) are highly susceptible to infection with the virus, and following infection these cells may produce many new copies of HIV before dying.",

As a retrovirus, the biology of HIV, including integration of the virus genome into host cell chromosomes, is a major problem in eradicating the virus from the body (see Chapter 3). In HIV-infected people receiving antiviral therapy there is a reservoir of latently infected resting CD4 \u00fe T cells. Many HIV patients can manage their infection with cocktails of antiretrovirus drugs that can reduce their viral loaddthe amount of virus circulating in the blood plasmadto undetectable levels.

Mathematical modeling and clinical observations suggest it might not ever be possible to completely eradicate the virus from the body with current therapies. The hope is that new approaches such as RNAi (see Chapter 6) might one day be able to tackle this latent virus pool and completely eliminate the virus from the body, curing the infection. Even if this is possible, the cost of these advanced therapies would be beyond the reach of developing countries where the majority of HIV-infected people live.

In this condition, virus replication continues at a low level, but defects in the envelope protein genes prevent the production of extracellular infectious virus particles.

Recent research has shown that the scandalous overuse of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal husbandry and even antibiotic treatment of infected people can stimulate the production of phage particles and contribute to the increased prevalence of STEC bacteria and growing human death toll. Other bacterial virulence determinants are also encoded by lysogenic phages (e.g., diphtheria toxin, Streptococcus erythrogenic toxins, Staphylococcus enterotoxins), although the selective pressures that maintain these arrangements are not yet understood.

Transformed cells have an altered phenotype, which is displayed as one (or more) of the following characteristics: n Loss of anchorage dependence: Normal (i.e., nontransformed) adherent cells such as fibroblasts or epithelial cells require a surface to which they can adhere. In the body, this requirement is supplied by adjacent cells or structures; in vitro, it is met by the glass or plastic vessels in which the cells are cultivated. Some transformed cells lose the ability to adhere to solid surfaces and float free (or in clumps) in the culture medium without loss of viability. n Colony formation in semisolid media: Most normal cells (both adherent and nonadherent cells such as lymphocytes) will not grow in media that are partially solid due to the addition of substances such as agarose or hydroxymethyl cellulose; however, many transformed cells will grow under these conditions, forming colonies since movement of the cells is restricted by the medium. n Decreased requirements for growth factors: All cells require multiple factors for growth. In a broad sense, these include compounds such as ions, vitamins, and hormones that cannot be manufactured by the cell. More specifically, it includes regulatory peptides such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that regulate the growth of cells.

Other classes of oncogenes located in the nucleus are normally involved with the control of the cell cycle (Figure 7.7) .

Some virus oncogenes are not sufficient on their own to produce a fully transformed phenotype in cells; however, in some instances, they may cooperate with another oncogene of complementary function to produce a fully transformed phenotype; for example, the adenovirus E1A gene plus either the E1B gene or the c-ras gene transforms NIH3T3 cells (a mouse fibroblast cell line).

Chronic transforming retrovirus genomes do not contain oncogenes. These viruses activate c-oncs by a mechanism known as insertional activation. A provirus that integrates into the host-cell genome close to a c-onc sequence may indirectly activate the expression of the gene in a way analogous to that in which v-oncs have been activated by transduction (Figure 7.8) . This can occur if the provirus is integrated upstream of the c-onc gene, which might be expressed via a read-through transcript of the virus genome plus downstream sequences; however, insertional activation can also occur when a provirus integrates downstream of a c-onc sequence or upstream but in an inverted orientation. In these cases, activation results from enhancer elements in the virus promoter (see Transformation by the third class of retroviruses operates by quite a different mechanism. Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) and related animal viruses encode a transcriptional activator protein in the virus tax gene. The Tax protein acts in trans to stimulate transcription from the virus LTR. It is believed that the protein also activates transcription of many cellular genes by interacting with transcription factors (Chapter 5); however, HTLV oncogenesis (i.e., the formation of a leukemic tumor) has a latent period of some 20 to 30 years. Therefore, cell transformation (which can be mimicked in vitro) and tumor formation (which cannot) are not one and the samedadditional events are required for the development of leukemia.

Several families of DNA viruses are capable of transforming cells (Table 7 .3). In general terms, the functions of their oncoproteins are much less diverse than those encoded by retroviruses. They are mostly nuclear proteins involved in the control of DNA replication, which directly affect the cell cycle. They achieve their effects by interacting with cellular proteins that normally appear to have a negative regulatory role in cell proliferation. Two of the most important cellular proteins involved are known as p53 and Rb. p53 was originally discovered by virtue of the fact that it forms complexes with SV40 T-antigen. It is now known that it also interacts with other DNA virus oncoproteins, including those of adenoviruses and papillomaviruses. The gene encoding p53 is mutated or altered in the majority of tumors, implying that loss of the normal gene product is associated with the emergence of malignantly transformed cells. Tumor cells, when injected with the native protein in vitro, show a decreased rate of cell division and decreased tumorigenicity in vivo. Transgenic mice that do not possess an intact p53 gene are developmentally normal but are susceptible to the formation of spontaneous tumors; therefore, it is clear that p53 plays a central role in controlling the cell cycle. It is believed to be a tumor suppressor or antioncogene and has been called the \"guardian of the genome.\" p53 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of certain cellular genes, notably WAF1, which encodes a protein that is an inhibitor of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases, causing the cell cycle to arrest at the G1 phase (Figure 7 .7).

E1A is a trans-acting transcriptional regulator of the adenovirus early genes (see Chapter 5). Like T-antigen, the E1A protein binds to Rb, inactivating the regulatory effect of this protein, permitting virus DNA replication, and accidentally stimulating cellular DNA replication (see earlier). E1B binds p53 and reinforces the effects of E1A. The combined effect of the two proteins can be seen in the phenotype of cells transfected with DNA containing these genes (Table 7 .4). However, the interaction of these transforming proteins with the cell is more complex than simple induction of DNA synthesis. Expression of E1A alone causes cells to undergo apoptosis. Expression of E1A and E1B together overcomes this response and permits transformed cells to survive and grow.",

Once again, transformation is mediated by the early gene products of the virus. However, the transforming proteins appear to vary from one type of papillomavirus to another, as shown in Table 7 .3. In general terms, it appears that two or more early proteins often cooperate to give a transformed phenotype. Although some papillomaviruses can transform cells on their own (e.g., BPV-1), others appear to require the cooperation of an activated cellular oncogene (e.g., HPV-16/ras). In bovine papillomavirus, it is the E5 protein that is responsible for transformation. In HPV-16 and HPV-18, the E6 and E7 proteins are involved.",

Different papillomaviruses appear to use slightly different mechanisms to achieve genome replication, so cell transformation may proceed via a slightly different route.

Hantaviruses cause two acute diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania. CHIKV is a member of the genus Alphavirus and the family Togaviridae. The disease caused by this virus typically consists of an acute illness characterized by fever, rash, and incapacitating joint pain. The word chikungunya means \"to walk bent over\" in some east African languages and refers to the effect of the joint pains that characterize this dengue-like infection. Chikungunya is a specifically tropical disease, but was previously geographically restricted and outbreaks were relatively uncommon. The virus remained largely unknown until a major outbreak in 2005 and 2006 on islands across the Indian Ocean. Plausible explanations for this outbreak (and subsequent spread, which has continued) include increased tourism, CHIKV introduction into a naive population, and virus mutation. It is the last of those three factors that seems to be most significant in this case, with the outbreak strain showing a single amino acid change in the envelope glycoprotein, which allows more effective transmission due to more efficient crossing of the mosquito gut membrane barrier. There is every possibility that CHIKV will continue to extend its territory, with recent outbreaks in Italy.",

TSWV is the type species of the Tospovirus genus and has a morphology and genomic organization similar to the other bunyaviruses (Chapter 3). However, TSWV undergoes propagative transmission, and it has been suggested that it may have acquired an extra gene in the M segment via recombination, either from a plant or from another plant virus.

In 1993, HPS was first recognized in the United States, and a new virus, Sin Nombre, was identified as the cause. It is now known that at least three different hantaviruses cause HFRS and four different viruses cause HPS. By 1995, HPS had been recognized in 102 patients in 21 states of the United States, in seven patients in Canada, and in three in Brazil, with an overall mortality rate of approximately 40%. These statistics illustrate the disease-causing potential of emerging viruses.West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the family Flaviviridae. All known members of this complex are transmissible by mosquitoes, and many of them can cause febrile, sometimes fatal, illnesses in humans. WNV was first isolated in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 but is in fact the most widespread of the flaviviruses, with geographic distribution including Africa and Eurasia. Unexpectedly, an outbreak of human encephalitis caused by WNV occurred in the United States in New York and surrounding states in 1999. In this case, the virus appears to have been transmitted from wild, domestic, and exotic birds by Culex mosquitoes (an urban mosquito that flourishes under dry conditions)d a classic pattern of arbovirus transmission. WNV RNA has been detected in overwintering mosquitoes and in birds, and the disease is now endemic across the United States, causing outbreaks each summer. This rapid spread into a new territory shows that spread did not rely on environmental factors such as climate changedthe North American environment was already suitable for the virus once it had been introduced, probably via air travel from the Middle East.",
