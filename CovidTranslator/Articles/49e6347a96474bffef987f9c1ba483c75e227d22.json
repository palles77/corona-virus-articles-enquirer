Uncloned wild type JHM virus induced in weanling rats mainly APE and SDE but only occasionally LDE. This finding suggests that uncloned JHM consists of a heterologous virus population with different biological properties. This is supported by the observation that cloned tissue culture adapted JHM virus always caused in weanling rats an APE, whereas certain temperature sensitive mutants derived from that JHM virus clone after mutagenization with fluoruracil caused SDE or LDE. No acute disease process could be induced with these ts-mutants. Reisolated mutants from diseased animals with LDE did not always maintain their temperature sensitivity but were different from revertants by the type of neurovirulence. Moreover, some characteristics in tissue culture were similar to the ts-mutants originally inoculated. The reisolate ts 42-1027 is an example for this phenomenon. This variant was reisolated from a diseased animal 3 months after infection with ts 42. The reisolate is much less temperature sensitive than the original mutant. It had an efficiency of plating of 1,6 x 10~1 compared to 1,4 x 10~4 for ts 42. In animals, this reisolate caused predominantely a high rate of SDE in contrast to its parental virus, which induced only few cases of LDE.",

Pathological investigations carried out 24 days after virus inoculation revealed only mild inflammations in liver tissue without detectable neuropathological changes.

After RNAse digestion oligonucleotides were analysed in a two dimensional gel electrophoresis (11) . The position of the large oligonucleotides within the fingerprint was compared. The result of this study (manuscript in preparation) is summarized in table 5 and indicates distinct differences between JHM virus and the other murine coronavirus strains. MHV 2, MHV 3 and MHV A59 are more closely related to each other than with MHV JHM, underlining the unique properties of this virus. COMMENTS From the five coronaviruses tested, only JHM revealed significant neurovirulence for weanling rats. The other murine coronaviruses induce beside liver inflammations no CNS lesion in general even after intracerebral inoculation. JHM virus infection resulted in three different CNS processes depending on the property of the inoculated virus preparation. This association provides a basis to investigate the mechanisms by which the different pattern of diseases are induced. It is conceivable that biochemical analysis of different mutants might unravel a specific marker which contributes to neurovirulence. The observation that JHM virus persists in weanling rats for months before LDE is recognized suggests that specific events, either host or virus derived, prevent a rapid spread of virus infection.",
