These in silico models encode and test hypotheses about mechanisms underlying the function of cells, the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of disease, and contribute to identification of new drug targets and drug design. The development of in silico models is facilitated by rapidly advancing experimental and analytical tools that generate information-rich, high-throughput biological data. Bioinformatics provides tools for pattern recognition, machine learning, statistical modeling, and data extraction from databases that contribute to in silico modeling. Dynamical systems theory is the natural language for investigating complex biological systems that demonstrate nonlinear spatio-temporal behavior. Most in silico models aim to complement (and not replace) experimental research. Experimental data are needed for parameterization, calibration, and validation of in silico models. Typical examples in biology are models for molecular networks, where the behavior of cells is expressed in terms of quantitative changes in the levels of transcripts and gene products, as well as models of cell cycle. In medicine, in silico models of cancer, immunological disease, lung disease, and infectious diseases complement conventional research with in vitro models, animal models, and clinical trials. This chapter presents basic concepts of bioinformatics, systems biology, their applications in in silico modeling, and also reviews applications in biology and disease.",

In step 2, for every protein (P) in TN, a blast search is performed against GoI to obtain the best hit sequences (Px). In step three these Px are then used as a query to perform a blast search against TG. If the best hit using Px as a query happens to be P, then both P and Px are selected as orthologous proteins in step four. If orthologs were detected for an interacting P and target gene then the interaction is transferred in GoI in the final step. Note that this automated way of detecting orthologs can infer false positives.",

Understanding the complexity of the disease and its biological significance in health can be achieved by integrating data from the different functional genomics experiments with medical, physiological, and environmental factor information, and computing mathematically. The advantage of mathematical modeling of disease lies in the fact that such models not only shed light on how a complex process works, which could be very difficult for inferring an understanding of each component of this process, but also predict what may follow as time evolves or as the characteristics of particular system components are modified.

Estimates come from diverse experiments, which may be elegantly designed and well executed but can still give rise to widely differing values for parameters. Data can come from both in vivo and in vitro experiments, and results that hold in one medium may not always hold in the other. Furthermore, despite the many similarities between mammalian systems, significant differences do exist, and so results obtained from experiments using animal and human tissue may not always be consistent. Also there are many considerations that cannot be applied. For example, one cannot investigate the role of stochastic fluctuations by removing them from the system, or one cannot directly explore the process that gave rise to current organisms.",

Then they applied evolutionary population dynamics and the Hill functions to interrogate this intercellular signaling network and execute an in silico tumor microenvironment development.

However, an appropriate management of these states requires further investigation. Translating the results of basic science research to effective therapeutic regimes has been a longstanding issue due in part to the failure to account for the complex nonlinear nature of the inflammatory process wherein SIRS/MOF represent a disordered state. Hence, the in silico modeling approach can be a promising research direction in this area. Indeed, in silico modeling of inflammation has been applied in an effort to bridge the gap between basic science and clinical trials. Specifically, both agent-based modeling and equation-based modeling have been utilized . Equation-based modeling encompasses primarily ordinary differential equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE). Initial modeling studies were focused on the pathophysiology of the acute inflammatory response to stress, and these studies suggested common underlying processes generated in response to infection, injury, and shock. Later, mathematical models included the recovery phase of injury and gave insight into the link between the initial inflammatory response and subsequent healing process. The first mathematical models of wound healing dates back to the 1980s and early 1990s. These models and others developed in the 1990s investigated epidermal healing, repair of the dermal extracellular matrix, wound contraction, and wound angiogenesis. Most of these models were deterministic and formulated using differential equations. In addition, recent models have been formulated using differential equations to analyze different strategies for improved healing, including wound VACs, commercially engineered skin substitutes, and hyperbaric oxygen. In addition, agent-based models have been used in wound healing research. For example, Mi et al. (2007) developed an agent-based model to analyze different treatment strategies with wound debridement and topical administration of growth factors. Their model produced the expected results of healing when analyzing for different treatment strategies including debridement, release of PDGF, reduction in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and increase of TGF-\u03b21. The investigators suggested that a drug company should use a mathematical model to test a new drug before going through the expensive process of basic science testing, toxicology and clinical trials. Indeed, clinical trial design can be improved by prior in silico modeling. For example, in silico modeling has led to the knowledge that patients who suffered from the immune-suppressed phenotype of late-stage multiple organ failure, and were susceptible to usually trivial nosocomial infections, demonstrated sustained elevated markers of tissue damage and inflammation through two weeks of simulated time. However, anti-cytokine drug trials with treatment protocols of only one dose or one day had not incorporated this knowledge into their design, with subsequent failure of candidate treatments.",

Now that we have an idea on what in silico modeling of infectious diseases are generally based on, we will outline a better understanding of the parameters that are considered in most in silico disease models.

The rationale behind their study was that a better understanding of host-pathogen/agent interactions would make possible the development of better anti-microbial drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (as well as provide similar understanding for the cases of other chronic infectious diseases). They modeled different types of host-pathogen/ agent equilibriums (ranging from completely static equilibrium, all the way through semi-dynamic, down to completely dynamic scenarios) by varying the rate of multiplication/growth and the rate of death of the pathogen/ agent (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) during the infection's chronic phase. Through their in silico study (which was also verified experimentally), they documented a number of remarkable findings. For example, they established that \"viable bacterial counts and total bacterial counts in the lungs of chronically infected mice do not diverge over time,\" and they explained that \"rapid degradation of dead bacteria is unlikely to account for the stability of total counts in the lungs over time because treatment of mice with isoniazid for 8 weeks led to a marked reduction in viable counts without reducing the total count. Readers who are interested in further details on the generation of this in silico model for the dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, as well as the complete details of the parameters/variables considered, and the comprehensive findings of the study, should refer to the article of Ernesto et al. published in infection and immunity.",

Through these, the potentially detrimental effects of reduced secretion of the chemical signal are annulled via compensation from the other components. This is just a simple example; much more complex regulatory and homeostatic mechanisms exist in the neuronal system. Despite the robustness of those mechanisms, things still get out of hand sometimes, and disease conditions result.

The process of A\u03b2-aggregation is strongly nucleation-dependent, and is inferred by the occurrence of a \"lag-phase\" prior to fibril growth that shows a sigmoidal pattern. Ghosh et al. (2010) dissected the growth curve into three biophysically distinct sections to simplify modeling and to allow the data to be experimentally verifiable. Stage I is where the pre-nucleation events occur whose mechanism is largely unknown. The pre-nucleation stage is extremely important in dictating the overall aggregation process where critical events such as conformation change and concomitant aggregation take place, and it is also the most experimentally challenging to decipher. In addition to mechanistic reasons, this stage is also physiologically important as lowmolecular-weight (LMW) species are implicated in AD pathology. The rate-limiting step of nucleation is followed by growth. The overall growth kinetics and structure and shape of the fibrils are mainly determined by the structure of the nucleating species. An important intermediate along the aggregation pathway, called \"protofibrils,\" have been isolated and characterized that have propensities to both elongate (by monomer addition) as well as to laterally associate (protofibril-protofibril association) to grow into mature fibrils (Stage III in the growth curve).",

Such in depth modeling of the aggregation pathway can suggest what concentrations of fatty acid interfaces should be used (under a given A\u03b2 concentration in the brain) to arrest the fibril formation process leading to direct drug dosage and interval prediction for AD patients.",

Furthermore, as the entire modeling and analysis are based on computational approaches, we can obtain the results of such analysis even within an hour. This saves huge amounts of time and reduces costs, two major factors associated with in vitro studies. However, a key issue that needs to be considered is whether in silico testing will ever be as accurate as in vitro or in vivo testing, or whether in silico results will always require non-simulated experimental confirmation. Tracqui et al. (1995) successfully developed a glioma model to show how chemo-resistant tumor sub-populations cause treatment failure. Similarly, a computational model of tumor invasion by Frieboes et al. (2006) is able to demonstrate that the growth of a tumor depends on the microenvironmental nutrient status, the pressure of the tissue, and the applied chemotherapeutic drugs. The 3D spatio-temporal simulation model of a tumor by Dionysiou et al. (2004) was able to repopulate, expand, and shrink tumor cells, thus providing a computational approach for assessment of radiotherapy outcomes. The glioblastoma model of Kirby et al. (2007) is able to predict survival outcome post-radiotherapy. Wu et al. (2012) has also developed an in silico glioma microenvironment that demonstrates that targeting the microenvironmental components could be a potential anti-tumor therapeutic approach.",
