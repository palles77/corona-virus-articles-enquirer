            "text": "Viral infections are important causes of disease of the respiratory tract. The common cold is the most frequently encountered infectious syndrome of humans, while influenza continues to be a major cause of mortality and serious morbidity worldwide. Respiratory viral infections frequently complicate the course of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. As the number of immunocompromised persons in the population has increased, infections due to cytomegalovirus and other herpes viruses, adenoviruses, and paramyxoviruses have assumed increasing importance in pulmonary medicine. Finally, recent years have seen the emergence of new viral respiratory pathogens, including hantaviruses, human metapneumovirus, avian influenza A viruses, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. This introductory section outlines general concepts of respiratory viral infections and their associated clinical syndromes. The following sections then provide a review of the major viral pathogens infecting the respiratory tract.",

Systemic complaints are absent or modest in severity and fever is unusual. Allergic diseases of the upper airway often have clinical manifestations similar to those of colds. Colds are frequently associated with involvement of the middle ear, likely due to viruses that cause colds. In some cases, pharyngeal symptoms predominate to a degree that overshadows other complaints. The kinins are potent stimulators of pain nerve endings, and high levels of bradykinin and lysylbradykinin are present in nasal secretions of patients with rhinovirusinduced colds. Intranasal application of bradykinin promotes sore throat and nasal symptoms in volunteers, supporting a role for these agents in the pathogenesis of cold symptoms. 5 The respiratory viruses causing pharyngitis can be divided into two groups: those associated with a pharyngeal or tonsillar exudate and those without such an exudate (Table 32-3) . Pharyngitis is often a prominent complaint with adenovirus and influenza virus infection. Also, some eustachian tube dysfunction. Colds are associated with symptomatic otitis media in approximately 2% of cases in adults and in a higher proportion in young children. Colds are frequently associated with sinus mucosal thickening or secretions on computed tomography scans but rarely result in symptomatic sinusitis. Vertigo associated with viral labyrinthitis may also be seen.",

Nasal sprays containing decongestants should be used for no more than 3 days, to avoid a rebound vasomotor rhinitis. Cough syrups containing expectorants are of unproven value in common colds. Symptoms of sneezing and rhinorrhea can be alleviated with nonselective antihistamines such as brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, or clemastine fumarate, 1 but treatment with selective H 1 inhibitors is not effective. Studies of pseudoephedrine have demonstrated measurable improvements in nasal air flow consistent with a decongestant effect. 2 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen moderate the systemic symptoms of rhinovirus infection. However, the use of the decongestant phenylpropanolamine has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. 3 Topical application of ipratropium, a quaternary anticholinergic agent that is minimally absorbed across biologic membranes, reduces rhinorrhea significantly in naturally occurring colds. This agent probably exerts its major effect on the parasympathetic regulation of mucous and seromucous glands. Importantly, most over-the-counter cough and cold remedies have not been studied in pediatric populations, where they may be associated with significant side effects. 4 ",

Systemic symptoms tend to dominate for the first several days of illness, whereas respiratory complaints, particularly cough, predominate later in the first week of illness. Photophobia, excess tearing, and pain with eye movement are common early in the illness. Mild conjunctivitis, clear nasal discharge without obstruction, pharyngeal injection, and small tender cervical lymph nodes are frequently present. Fever may peak at 39\u00b0 C to 40\u00b0 C or higher and can last for 1 to 5 days. Persistent nonproductive cough, easy fatigability, and asthenia are common in the second week of illness. Influenza type A and B viruses are the most important causes of the influenza syndrome, particularly when the illness presents in an epidemic form. However, the syndrome can also be seen in association with infection by other viruses, including adenovirus, parainfluenza, and RSV. The characteristic clinical features of influenza and its epidemic nature usually permit the practitioner to make an accurate diagnosis during recognized epidemics of influenza virus infection, particularly if cough and fever are present. 8 Specific antiviral therapy is effective if given early in the course of the illness (see the section on influenza virus). Symptomatic treatment (bed rest, oral hydration, antipyretics, and antitussives) is also beneficial. Fever should be treated in certain clinical situations, such as in children with previous febrile convulsions or patients with preexisting cardiac disease.

Quantitative measurement of adenovirus DNA levels in plasma may be useful for diagnosis and response to therapy. 26 Frozen specimens (\u221270\u00b0 C) are satisfactory for testing because of the relative stability of adenoviruses. In cell culture, cytopathic effect usually appears in 3 to 7 days but may take several weeks, thus limiting the utility of viral culture in guiding clinical management. The time required to detect virus in cell culture can be shortened to as little as 2 days by employing centrifugation culture systems. Serodiagnosis has relied primarily on testing for a groupspecific complement-fixation antibody response, using acute and convalescent serum specimens; however, infection with some adenovirus types is not detected by the viruses and therefore, when present, is a useful diagnostic finding in adenovirus respiratory disease. With adenovirus respiratory disease, the conjunctivitis is typically mild and follicular, although some adenovirus types also cause the more severe condition, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Fever, chills, myalgia, and prostration are prominent features of adenovirus infection, so it is often perceived by the patient as a \"flulike\" illness or an unusually severe cold.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E have been recognized as causes of the common cold for many years and cause frequent reinfections throughout life. In adults, these viruses account for 4% to 15% of acute respiratory disease annually and up to 35% during peak periods. Annual illness rates in children reach 8%, with peak rates up to 20%. 34 When polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were applied to samples collected over 20 years from children younger than 5, coronaviruses were associated with 11.4 lower respiratory tract episodes and 67.3 upper respiratory tract illnesses per 1000 person-years. 35 The reported frequency of infection in adults for 229E and OC43 viruses has ranged from 15 to 25 per 100 persons per year, with up to 80% of infections seen in persons with prior antibody to the infecting virus. 36 Coronaviruses usually circulate during winter and early spring but can be detected year-round. 37 Novel coronaviruses have recently been associated with severe respiratory disease in outbreaks around the world. SARS emerged in southern China in 2003 and quickly spread globally. 38 The causative virus was subsequently named SARS-CoV. Ultimately, at least 8098 probable cases of severe respiratory disease and 774 deaths in all ages were attributable to SARS worldwide before the outbreak terminated in 2004. The source of this outbreak is believed to have been from an animal reservoir, the civet cat. More recently, a second outbreak of coronavirus severe respiratory illness has been recognized, with cases primarily found in Middle Eastern countries. 39,39a,39b In May 2014, the first case of MERS was confirmed in a traveler from Saudi Arabia to the United States. A second case was identified in a traveler from Saudi Arabia to Florida. The two cases were not linked. 39c The virus responsible for MERS has been named MERS-CoV. It is genetically closely related to coronaviruses found in bats, and evidence indicates that MERS-CoV also infects camels, but the role of each of these in transmission to humans remains to be defined. 40, 41 Information on MERS-CoV is actively evolving; current information can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/.",

Distinctive club-shaped projections are present on the virus surface, giving the appearance of having a crown or corona, from which it derives its name. Coronaviruses are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The beta genus is further subdivided into four lineages, A-D. The human coronavirus strains 229E (HCoV 229E) and HCoV NL63 are members of the alpha genus, while the human strains HCoV OC43 and HKU1 are members of the beta genus. The novel coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are also members of the beta genus, in lineages B and C, respectively. 33 The virus contains five structural proteins: spike or S protein, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), M (matrix), E (envelope), and N (nucleocapsid). The spike protein is the major envelope glycoprotein and mediates both attachment to cells and fusion with the cell membrane; antibodies to the spike protein are thought to be associated with protection and thus are candidates for therapeutic and vaccine targets. The second envelope protein, HE, is only found in some coronavirus strains. Nonstructural proteins such as the effective immunity short-term because rechallenge with homotypic virus, the 229E serotype, resulted in infection and illness. 57 In addition, under certain circumstances, vaccines against animal coronaviruses have led to enhanced disease. 58 This is being taken into consideration but is not deterring efforts to develop an efficacious SARS-CoV vaccine. 59 There are no currently available antiviral agents with demonstrated clinical activity against coronaviruses in humans. Agents with potential activity against SARS-CoV include chloroquine, protease inhibitors, ribavirin, type I interferons, niclosamide, and anti-inflammatory agents such as indomethacin. [60] [61] [62] Ribavirin in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir (protease inhibitors used in HIV disease) was associated with a lower incidence of adverse outcomes compared with historical controls of ribavirin alone in one study. Nelfinavir, another protease inhibitor, has also demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity. Other targets for controlling SARS viral replication have included interferons. Although the mechanisms are unknown, chloroquine, niclosamide, and indomethacin all inhibit SARS-CoV in vitro. [63] [64] [65] CYTOMEGALOVIRUS Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily of the herpes viruses and has the same structural and biochemical characteristics, which include an internal core containing linear double-stranded DNA, an icosadeltahedral capsid containing 162 capsomeres, and an envelope derived from the host-cell nuclear membrane. However, the large size of the CMV virion (200 nm) and larger genome (>200,000 bp) distinguish it from other human herpes viruses. There is approximately 80% homology between the genomes of various strains of CMV, but sufficient differences exist to permit strain identification by restriction endonuclease analysis. The CMV genome codes for approximately 33 structural proteins, the functions of many of which are currently unknown. In addition, clinical isolates often encode multiple gene products not seen in laboratory strains. Envelope glycoproteins B and H have been identified as major antigens eliciting neutralizing antibody. Glycoprotein B may also be a target for cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, 66 while multiple proteins also serve as targets for T-cell responses. CMV-specific, cytotoxic T-cell responses are an important host defense mechanism that is associated with survival from CMV infection in bone marrow transplant recipients. 67 However, CMV uses multiple mechanisms, including down-regulation of HLA class I on the cell surface and interference with antigen processing, to evade recognition by the host.",

Both miliary and interstitial radiographic patterns have been described. Patients with a miliary pattern may have a sudden onset of tachypnea, severe respiratory distress, and hypoxemia resulting in a rapidly fatal course, 78 whereas patients with an interstitial pattern of disease often have an insidious onset of pneumonia with slowly progressive hypoxemia. In these patients, pulmonary opacities may be initially localized, with bilateral spread over days or weeks. Often the perihilar distribution of the opacity is suggestive of pulmonary edema. 74 Common chest CT scan findings include small nodules (see eFigs. 91-3B, 91-4, 91-5), consolidation (see eFig. , and ground-glass attenuation (see eFigs. 91-3 and 91-5). 79 In patients with possible CMV pneumonia, the preferred approach to diagnosis is quantitative PCR in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. 80 Culture and pathologic examination of specimens obtained by BAL and transbronchial biopsy may also be diagnostic, although these specimens are less suitable for making management decisions in acutely ill patients. The detection of virus in respiratory secretions, urine, or blood does not establish with certainty that CMV is responsible for a particular clinical syndrome. This is particularly true in patients with AIDS, in whom detection of CMV in BAL is often not associated with pulmonary pathology. However, in transplant recipients, the presence of CMV in blood does increase the risk of subsequent development of CMV pneumonia and is used in guiding preemptive therapy. Serologic testing has no role in diagnosis of acute infection and is used only to determine the serologic status of donors and recipients before transplantation.",

The rodent hosts experience prolonged asymptomatic infection, but the features that are associated with maintenance of these viruses in rodent populations and with rodent-to-rodent transmission are unclear. Serologic studies suggest that hantaviral infection of feral rodents is widespread throughout North America. 86 Transmission to humans is presumed to result from contact with infected rodent excreta. Hantaviruses are stable and can persist in the environment for 10 to 15 days without loss of viability. 87 Risk factors for acquisition of HPS include high densities of rodents in the household, cleaning of contaminated environments, agricultural activities, and other forms of occupational exposure to rodent droppings. In the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States, El Ni\u00f1o-southern oscillation events have been linked to increased rainfall, high rodent population densities, and increased numbers of cases of HPS. 88 Person-to-person transmission was not seen in the North American outbreaks. 89 In contrast, a recent outbreak of HPS in South America has suggested that, under certain circumstances, person-to-person transmission can take place. 90 This feature appears to be unique to the particular hantavirus implicated in that outbreak (Andes virus) and has not been a major component of other outbreaks. Currently, approximately 11 to 48 cases of HPS per year are reported in the United States, 91 with a case fatality rate of 35%.",

Characteristically, the lesions appear as large (5 to 15 mm) individual ulcerations that are slowly progressive and may coalesce when present in adjacent sites. The base of the ulcer is white or gray. Although shallow, the lesions are usually painful and may reduce oral intake. Herpetic lesions are sometimes present on the lip and skin of the face. Infection may spread to the esophagus and lower airway, possibly facilitated by instrumentation such as orotracheal intubation or bronchoscopy, resulting in the development of similar lesions at these sites. Clinical features of herpetic tracheobronchitis include dyspnea, cough, fever, chills, diaphoresis, chest pain, wheezes, hypotension, and hypoxemia. 116 Herpetic tracheobronchitis has also been reported in elderly patients presenting with bronchospasm who did not have histories of chronic lung disease or of immunosuppression. 117",

At least 16 highly divergent, antigenically distinct HAs (H1 to H16), and at least 9 distinct NAs (N1 to N9), have been described in influenza A viruses. Influenza A viruses are therefore further divided into subtypes on the basis of the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) (e.g., H1N1 or H3N2). Infection with influenza virus results in long-lived resistance to reinfection with the homologous virus. Infection induces both systemic and local antibodies, as well as cellular distinctive. 119 In one study, more than one half of the patients had concomitant pulmonary infection with other microorganisms, including bacterial, candidal, and Aspergillus species and cytomegalovirus. 114 Histologic evidence of herpetic esophagitis was present in 10 of 16 patients with herpes pneumonia in whom esophageal examination was performed.

            "text": "Influenza epidemics are regularly associated with morbidity and mortality, usually expressed in the form of excess rates of pneumonia and influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths, with as many as 51,000 deaths annually in the United States. 125 Attack rates are generally highest in the young, whereas mortality is generally highest in the elderly. Excess morbidity and mortality are particularly high in those with medical conditions including pulmonary conditions such as asthma or COPD. Rates of influenzarelated hospitalizations are particularly high in healthy children younger than 2, where rates approach those of older children with high-risk conditions. 126, 127 A high frequency of antigenic variation is a unique feature of influenza virus that helps explain why this virus continues to cause epidemic disease. Antigenic variation principally involves the two external glycoproteins of the virus, the HA and NA, and is referred to as antigenic drift or antigenic shift, depending on whether the variation is small or great. Antigenic drift refers to relatively minor antigenic changes that result from amino acid changes in one or more of the five identified major antigenic sites on the HA molecule. 128 Antigenic shift refers to the complete replacement of the HA or NA with a novel HA or NA. These viruses are \"new\" viruses to which the population has no specific immunity. When such a new virus is introduced into a population, a severe, worldwide epidemic, or pandemic, of influenza can result. Influenza pandemics in the 20th century include the H1N1 pandemic of 1918, the H2N2 pandemic of 1957, and the H3N2 pandemic of 1968. Extensive surveillance and sequence information suggests that these new HA and NA genes are introduced into viruses circulating in humans from resident populations of influenza A viruses in birds. 129 Since 1997, sporadic outbreaks of influenza in humans caused by direct transmission of avian viruses from bird to human have been reported. Although sustained human-tohuman transmission has not been seen, avian subtypes such as H5N1 130 and H7N9 131 continue to pose a potential pandemic threat. In the spring of 2009, a novel H1N1 virus containing genes from viruses of swine, avian, and human origin emerged. Importantly, the HA gene of this virus was derived from swine influenza virus. Although still an H1N1 virus, the novel, or pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) was antigenically distinct from the human H1N1 viruses in circulation since 1977. Instead, the HA was closely related to human H1 viruses from the early 20th century that had been introduced into pigs in approximately 1918 and had not undergone significant antigenic evolution in these animals since bilateral abnormalities (Fig. 32-9 , eFigs. 32-6 and 32-7), sometimes suggestive of an acute lung injury pattern or ARDS (eFig. 32-8). H1N1 (\"swine-origin\") influenza infection has a relatively nonspecific appearance, ranging from normal or nearly normal chest radiography at presentation to multifocal bilateral opacities resembling multifocal pneumonia (eFig. 32-9) or a noninfectious acute lung injury pattern. Chest CT often shows multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity and consolidation, which may show a peripheral distribution, resembling organizing pneumonia fever, lassitude, and confusion without any of the characteristic respiratory complaints. There may be a wide range of symptoms, but the presence of fever plus either sore throat or cough is predictive of positive culture results for influenza in adults.",

The reported sensitivities of each test in comparison to cell culture or nucleic acid amplification varies between 40% and 80% and depends on the nature of the samples tested and the viral strain. In general, sensitivities in adults and elderly patients tend to be lower than those reported in young children, who shed much larger quantities of virus and higher concentrations of antigen in their samples. 148 Similarly, sensitivity is likely to be higher early in the course of illness, when viral shedding is maximal. Molecular diagnostic techniques have recently emerged as the diagnostic modality of choice in most laboratories. Real-time RT-PCR methods have been developed and licensed and are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 17. Many of these tests are designed to detect multiple respiratory pathogens simultaneously and are leading to a growing recognition of the role of respiratory viruses and coinfection in diverse respiratory infections. 148a Most cases of influenza, in otherwise healthy individuals with typical symptoms during the course of a recognized influenza epidemic, do not need specific viral confirmation. However, diagnostic testing should be used if the results of the test will influence subsequent clinical management, such as the use of antiviral agents, the need for antibacterial drugs, and the use of infection control. 149 Virus can also be isolated readily from nasal swab specimens, nasal aspirates, combined nose and throat swabs, sputum, or endotracheal aspirate specimens. More than 90% of positive influenza cultures can be detected within 3 days of inoculation. 150 (eFig. 32-9B-E), although other patterns, including small nodules (eFigs. 32-10A and B), ground-glass opacity associated with linear and reticular abnormalities without a clear zonal distribution (eFig. 32-10C), and lobar consolidation (eFig. 32-10D), may be observed.

Such recommendations were complex and in some ways difficult to implement, leading to lower than desired vaccine uptake. In addition, it was recognized that more universal vaccination strategies, particularly of children, might be able to impact the spread of influenza in the community. Currently, the United States and many other countries have adopted a universal vaccination strategy with annual vaccination of all members of the population.

This domain of HA mutates frequently, and amino acid substitutions in this domain allow the new viral variant to escape recognition by antibodies that developed in response to the original virus. Thus, new antigenic variant viruses emerge regularly, and this necessitates development and administration of new influenza vaccines each year. The costly and logistically complex requirement for a distinct influenza vaccine each year has stimulated efforts to develop a vaccine that targets conserved domains of the influenza virus hemagglutinin, rather than the variable globular head domain. Although these efforts have revealed evidence for broadly neutralizing antibodies produced by certain subjects, a clear strategy for production of a vaccine that induces broadly neutralizing antibodies has not yet emerged.

Current vaccines contain one example of H1N1, one example of H3N2, and either one or both lineages of influenza B. Inactivated vaccines are administered intramuscularly or intradermally and are primarily designed to induce systemic antibody, although they also induce cellular immune responses that may be associated with protection. Inactivated vaccines are well tolerated in all age groups, although hypersensitivity to hens' eggs is a relative contraindication to use of eggproduced vaccines. Generally, if persons can eat eggs or egg-containing products, vaccination is safe. If necessary, individuals with anaphylaxis can be desensitized and safely vaccinated, 151 or vaccines free of egg products can be used.",

Symptoms and signs indicative of bacterial infection usually begin 5 to 10 days after onset of the rash. One study employing transtracheal aspiration found a range of bacterial pathogens in adults, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and S. pneumoniae. 191 Up to 30% of cases are complicated by otitis media or sinusitis. Acute nonrespiratory complications include hepatitis, encephalitis, keratitis, mesenteric adenitis, as well as a high rate of severe diarrheal disease in children in developed countries. Measles infection or vaccination may be accompanied by conversion of the tuberculin skin reaction from positive to negative for weeks. Measles may exacerbate active penetration of cells, but no neuraminidase. The cell surface molecule SLAM (Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule) serves as a receptor for entry of the virus into susceptible cells. 185 In addition, the complement regulatory protein CD46 can also serve as a receptor, particularly for the vaccine strain. 186 Only one serotype of wild measles virus is recognized, although minor antigenic differences are detectable by monoclonal antibodies. The human is the sole natural host for measles virus.",

Epidemiologic factors related to serious illness in infected infants include low socioeconomic status, crowding, maternal smoking, lack of breast feeding, day care center attendance, and history of allergic disease. RSV is also recognized as a cause of severe disease in older adults 245 and may result in a greater total burden of mortality in the elderly than in infants. 125 RSV spreads by large-particle aerosols during close personal contact and by hand contamination with infectious secretions and subsequent self-inoculation of the eye or nose.

Aerosolized ribavirin is currently recommended for use only in selected infants and young children who are at high risk for serious RSV disease. 262 In immunosuppressed patients, particularly hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, both aerosolized ribavirin and high-dose oral ribavirin have been used for early treatment to prevent progression to pneumonia. 263 Recent studies suggest that intermittent aerosolized ribavirin is as effective as continuous aerosolized ribavirin in these patients. 264 Once RSV pneumonia has developed, intravenous ribavirin alone is ineffective but, if treatment is initiated before the onset of respiratory failure, combinations of aerosolized ribavirin with intravenous immunoglobulin, and particularly paluvizumab (see later) may be beneficial. 265, 266 In adults, short courses of systemic corticosteroids for RSV-related wheezing did not affect viral loads or shedding and only mildly diminished antibody responses. 267 An effective vaccine for prevention of RSV has not yet been developed. In a study of formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine conducted in the 1960s, vaccinated infants developed more severe disease compared with unvaccinated children. 268 The mechanisms of this enhancement remain uncertain, although studies in those vaccine recipients and in rodent models have implicated low levels or low affinity of the antibodies induced by the formalin-inactivated vaccine, which permitted excessive cytolytic T-cell responses to develop and cause tissue damage. Low-affinity antibodies may also have contributed to immune complex formation and deposition, leading to local inflammation. 269, 270 Formalin-inactivated RSV also primes a T helper 2 response, with high levels of interleukin 4 and interleukin 5, which can promote inflammation of small airways. 271 Although this adverse experience has prompted extra caution, current RSV vaccine development efforts are ongoing and focus on live attenuated and recombinant subunit vaccines.",

During the period of illness, sloughed ciliated epithelial cells containing viral antigen are present in nasal secretions. 281 In general, the number of RV-infected cells in the nasopharynx appears to be limited, 282 and infection does not lead to detectable damage to the epithelium of the nasal passages. These results have suggested that virus-induced cellular injury is not the direct cause of symptoms in RV colds and that inflammatory mediators play an important role. Nasal secretions during the initial response to RV infection are predominantly the result of increased vascular permeability, as demonstrated by elevated levels of plasma proteins in nasal secretions. 283 Glandular secretions (lactoferrin, lysozyme, and secretory IgA) predominate late in colds. 283 In contrast to the situation in allergic rhinitis, histamine does not appear to play a role in the induction of symptoms in colds. Nasal secretion kinin levels correlate with symptoms in natural and experimental colds, and intranasal administration of bradykinin causes increased nasal vascular permeability, rhinitis, and sore throat. 284 Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations also increase in experimental RV colds and correlate well with symptom severity. 285 Enhanced synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules in the middle ear may also contribute to the pathogenesis of otitis media associated with colds. 286 Polymorphisms in the IL-6 gene affect the symptomatic response to experimental RV challenge in adults. 287 ",
