The VP2-LTB DNA fragment was cloned into vector pPG611 or pPG612 to generated inducible surface-displayed and secretion expression systems based on xylose promoter, designated as rLc:pPG611-VP2-LTB (recombinant L. casei) and rLc:pPG612-VP2-LTB, respectively. Expression of the fusion protein was verified by SDS-PAGE, Western blot immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. It was observed that the level of IgG or sIgA from mice orally immunized with VP2-LTB was higher than that from mice received VP2 and negative control, which demonstrated significantly statistically different. Especially, the titer of IgG or sIgA in mice immunized with rLc:pPG612-VP2-LTB is the highest in this study. In summary, LTB as mucosal adjuvant was able to effectively facilitate induction of mucosal and systemic immunity by L. casei-expressing VP2 fusion protein.",

Two well-characterized bacterial proteins with an outstanding potential to function as mucosal adjuvant are the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) of Escherichia coli and the cholera toxin (CT) of Vibrio cholerae. Their non-toxic mucosal binding B subunits (LTB/CTB) have already been tested for their immunogenicity and their ability to act as mucosal adjuvant [13] . LTB has been found to be a more potent adjuvant than CTB [14] . Therefore, VP2 has been expressed as a fusion protein with E. coli heat-liable toxin B subunit (LTB) in the L. casei. LTB is a gut adhesion molecule and helpful to antigen uptake from and binding to gut [15] . It was reported that the expression of heterologous antigen fused with LTB in attenuated Salmonella has been described an optimized strategy for the induction of mucosal and systemic antibodies responses [16] . LTB is responsible for heterologous protein exposure to mucosal immune system via binding to GM 1 ganglioside anchored on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells so that it can function also as mucosal adjuvant producing higher titer serum and secretory antibodies in mice orally administered with L. casei-expressing VP2-LTB.",

It was consistently observed that IgG antibody response of mice orally immunized with L. casei-expressing rPPV-VP2-LTB fusion protein displayed stronger PPV-neutralizing activity than L. casei-expressing rPPV-VP2 from 4-fold to 128-fold dilution of sera, which was exhibited by reduction in the number of plaque. The final dilution of antibody obtained from the mice immunized with rLc:pPG612-VP2-LTB or rLc:pPG611-VP2-LTB was 1:128 significantly different from rLc:pPG612-VP2 (1:64) and rLc:pPG611-VP2 (1:32).

The initial infection of PPV mainly occurs at the mucosa of intestines [21] ; this is a critical step in the infection process. Therefore, mucosal administration is the first choice of vaccination as an effective prophylactic method against PPV invasion, which is taken for granted. Mucosal vaccination is able to induce the effective not only mucosal but also systemic immune response, but parental vaccination can not. As such, the most of researches is currently focused on the development of appropriate mucosal vaccine for oral administration. For example, the recombinant attenuated pseudorabies virus [22] was able to protect mice against viral challenge. Nevertheless, the majority of these live vectors are potentially risk prone.",

According to the above statement, the induced recombinant strains were able to stimulate the mucosal immune system of gastrointestinal tract for several days but not a lifetime after oral administration in mice, which did not result in immunotolerance against target antigen. When the induced recombinant bacteria colonized on the mucosal surface, although the xylose was not present, VP2-LTB protein has been still keeping secretory or trans-membrane state in host cell and was recognized, processed and present by relevant lymphocytes in the mucosal immune system, which could induce local immune responses.
