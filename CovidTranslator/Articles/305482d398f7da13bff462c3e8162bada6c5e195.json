            "text": "Wild birds are the natural host/reservoir for influenza viruses. However, other species can be susceptible. For example, domestic poultry are often subject to rapidly progressive disease with high mortality rates. Migratory birds, by contrast, can be relatively resistant to infection, despite carrying the virus. 1 The subtypes of influenza which cause disease in birds are named according to the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins carried by the virus; 16 haemagglutinins and 9 neuraminidases are recognized. Viruses causing mild disease are referred to as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI). Symptoms include ruffled feathers and decreased egg production. Those causing serious illness are referred to as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Mortality rates may be up to 100% at 48 hours. 2 Features of the severe disease are oedema of the head, cyanosis of the comb and wattles (neck and throat), diarrhoea, loss of appetite and respiratory distress. 1 There may be massive internal haemorrhage which leads to the term 'chicken ebola'. So far the HPAI viruses have been H5 or H7 subtypes. 2 H5N1 can lead to highly virulent disease. In 2003/4, outbreaks of H5N1 in Europe and South East Asia led to the destruction of millions of birds either from disease or due to mass culling (in attempts to eradicate the virus from poultry stocks). The H5N1 subtype of avian influenza has also been seen in the UK, recently in Suffolk in February 2007. The outbreak in Dereham, Norfolk, in April 2006 involved the less virulent subtype H7N3. 1",

Cases were seen throughout the year, but incidence peaked during periods correlating with winter and spring in the Northern Hemisphere. 5 Clinical presentation and clinical course of human H5N1 disease Typically, the initial features comprise a high fever (>38 \u00b0C) associated with an influenza-like illness. The frequency of other symptoms is listed in Table 1 . 6 There have been case reports of patients presenting with diarrhoea or encephalopathy ahead of respiratory symptoms. 2 The disease is difficult to distinguish from other acute febrile respiratory infections in the absence of epidemiological linkage. A travel, occupational and contact history is therefore very important. 7 Patients may deteriorate rapidly, typically developing signs and symptoms of pneumonia 5 to 7 days from symptom onset.",

It is not known whether these 'superspreaders' secreted an unusually large amount of infectious material or whether another unknown factor amplified transmission.

Different Hanta viruses are each carried by different rodent species. Hanta viruses found in Asia predominantly cause haemorrhagic disease with renal syndromes. 19 In 1993, an outbreak of new rapidly progressive pulmonary syndrome in the South Western US led to a new species of Hanta virus being recognized. Named 'Sin Nombre' virus, its major host is the deer mouse. This virus causes a predominantly respiratory illness (HPS -hantavirus pulmonary syndrome), generally without the haemorrhagic and renal syndromes. Since the first outbreak, cases have been reported throughout the US and Western Europe. Between 1993 and March 2007, 465 cases were confirmed in 30 states in the US, 75% of which were from rural areas. The mean age was 38 years (range 10-83 years); 64% of cases were male and the mortality rate was 35%. 19 In confirmed cases where exposure information was known, 70% had had exposure to rodents via domestic activities, e.g. cleaning in homes showing signs of rodent infestation. Occupational exposure was less common but HPS has been seen in, for example, grain farmers and field biologists. 10 Cases in the UK have also been seen, particularly in returning travellers. Table 2 Clinical presentation HPS presents with an influenza-like illness lasting 3-5 days. Symptoms include high fever, myalgia, headache and tachycardia, often associated with gastrointestinal disturbance. In some patients, after about seven days, the cardiopulmonary phase may abruptly begin. Hypotension develops with progressive non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and severe hypoxia (an ARDS-like picture). Patients often need mechanical ventilation and intensive care support. Chest imaging shows rapid progression from minimal pulmonary oedema to severe bilateral interstitial oedema. Distinguishing HPS from other viral illnesses is difficult. The presence of rashes, conjunctival haemorrhage, peripheral oedema and multi-organ failure make HPS unlikely.",
