            "text": "Viruses are small, obligatory-intracellular parasites that contain either DNA or RNA as their genetic material. They depend entirely on host cells to replicate their genomes and produce infectious progeny. Viral penetration into the host cell is followed by genome uncoating, genome expression and replication, assembly of new virions and their egress. These steps can occur in close association with cellular structures, in particular cellular membranes and the cytoskeleton. Viruses are known to manipulate cells to facilitate their replication cycle, and some induce impressive intracellular membrane alterations that are devoted to the efficient replication of their genomes. Of these, viruses that have a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity ((+)RNA viruses) are the best investigated. However, membrane-bound viral-cytoplasmic replication is not restricted to RNA viruses, as exemplified by poxviruses, which are large DNA viruses that replicate their DNA in the cytoplasm.",

Based on morphological resemblance it was proposed that the formation of these structures must be similar to cellular-membrane biogenesis. A recent focus of research at the interface between virology and cell biology is the dissection of the molecular requirements that underlie the formation of virus-induced membrane rearrangements. In this Review, we discuss how viruses modify intracellular membranes, highlight possible similarities between the structures that are induced by viruses of different families and discuss how these structures could be formed. Given that the biogenesis of these striking structures involves interplay between the virus and the host cell, the role of both viral and cellular proteins is addressed.",

Budding and vesicle formation is mediated by coat proteins, such as coatomer protein complex (COP) I and II, and clathrin coats.

HCV infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and affects 170 million people worldwide 4 . Two viruses that are closely related to HCV, GB virus (GBV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), are often used as model systems for HCV owing to the ease of handling of these viruses in cell culture. Two well-studied viruses from the Togaviridae family are the alphavirus semliki Forest virus (sFV) and the rubivirus rubella virus. The mosquito-borne sFV, which is endemic in Africa, India and south-eastern parts of Asia, is non-pathogenic for humans. By contrast, rubella virus infection causes a self-limiting disease in humans that is known as rubella or German measles. In utero infection with this virus can have serious consequences for the developing foetus. The Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae families, which are unified in the order Nidovirales, include murine hepatitis virus (MHV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and the human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sARs-CoV).",

            "text": "Despite differences in genome organization, virion morphology and host range (TAblEs 1,2), these viruses have fundamentally similar strategies for genome replication. By definition, the viral (+)RNA genome has the same polarity as cellular mRNA. Therefore, the genome can be translated by the host cell translation machinery into one or multiple viral polyproteins, which are co-and post-translationally cleaved by viral and host cell proteases into proteins. A large part of the viral genome is devoted to non-structural proteins, which are not part of the virion and carry out important functions during viral replication. Following translation and polyprotein processing, a complex is assembled that includes the viral-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), further accessory nonstructural proteins, viral RNA and host cell factors. These so-called replication complexes (RCs) carry out viral-RNA synthesis. For all (+)RNA viruses that have been investigated so far, the RC seems to be associated with virus-induced membrane structures that are derived from different cellular compartments (FIG. 1) . The RCs of members of the flaviviruses, hepaciviruses, coronaviruses, arteriviruses and picornaviruses associate with membranes that are derived from the ER. Togaviruses associate with membranes of endocytic origin instead, whereas nodaviruses associate with mitochondrial membranes (FIG. 1) .",

Schematic representation of a cell and different intracellular organelles. Proteins that are destined for secretion enter the secretory pathway by co-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (pink dots represent ribosomes). These proteins are then transported in a coatomer protein complex (COP) II-dependent way to the Golgi complex in a process that probably involves COPII-coated vesicles and membrane structures that are located in the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi complex. Proteins can be recycled back to the ER using COPI-coated vesicles or can be transported through the Golgi complex. At the trans-Golgi network, they leave the Golgi and are transported to the plasma membrane. Endocytosis is initiated at the plasma membrane, and proteins are packed into clathrin-coated vesicles before being transported to early and late endosomes.

EM observations made more than 40 years ago described clusters of heterogeneously sized vesicles of 70-400 nm in diameter that were present in the perinuclear regions of PV-infected cells 9 (FIG. 2a) . PV is the paradigm for a virus that induces membrane alterations to be the site of RNA replication [10] [11] [12] , as assessed by in situ hybridization 13 . PV-induced vesicle clusters are probably derived from the ER, although sub-cellular fractionation revealed that they also contain endocytic and Golgi-complex markers, suggesting a complex biogenesis of these structures (discussed below) 14 . Other members of the Picornaviridae family have also been shown to replicate their RNA genomes on modified membranes that accumulate in the cytosol of infected cells 15 . The membrane rearrangements that are involved in RNA replication of HCV, a member of the Flaviviridae family that belongs to the Hepacivirus genus, constitute the membranous web 16, 17 . This structure, which consists of clusters of membrane vesicles that are embedded in a membranous matrix (FIG. 2b) , was found to contain HCV non-structural proteins and is probably derived from the ER. Detection of viral (+)RNA that was associated with these web structures using metabolic labelling of the nascent viral RNA with 5-bromouridine 5\u2032-triphosphate (box 1), revealed that the membranous web is the site of viral-RNA synthesis 17 to be derived from the ER. DMVs with a diameter of up to 400 nm were also observed in cells that were infected with the human pathogen sARs-CoV (FIG. 2d) . In common with EAV and MHV, microscopic studies identified the ER as the most likely source of membranes for the sARs-CoV DMVs 22, 23 . One of the many (+)RNA plant viruses that are known to induce membrane rearrangements in infected cells [24] [25] [26] [27] is TMV 28 .

Both nascent viral RNA and viral non-structural proteins localize to the CPVs that are induced by sFV and rubella virus [33] [34] [35] . CPVs are modified endosomal and lysosomal structures that are 600-2,000 nm in size. The use of endosomes and lysosomes as sites of viral replication seems to be unique to the Togaviridae family 36 . The CPV surface consists of small vesicular invaginations or spherules of homogenous size that have a diameter of approximately 50 nm and line the vacuole membrane at regular intervals [37] [38] [39] . EM analysis revealed that thread-like ribonucleoprotein structures extend from the inside of the spherules to the cytoplasmic face of sFV CPVs. Viral RNA polymerase is also present in large, branching, granular and threadlike structures that are anchored to the cytoplasmic surface of CPVs at the spherules. Interestingly, the ER is present in close proximity to alphavirus CPVs and is implicated in providing efficient translation of the viral glycoproteins that are required for assembly.",

The outer-mitochondrial membrane of FHV-infected Drosophila spp. cells contains numerous virus-induced spherule-like invaginations that are 40-60 nm in diameter and are connected to the cytoplasm by necked channels 40 . These invaginations are the putative sites of viral-RNA replication.

            "text": "Several methods are used to specifically detect intracellular viral RNA. One way is to use antibodies that recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is an intermediate of plus-stranded RNA-virus replication. The use of dsRNAspecific antibodies in electron or immunofluorescence microscopy can provide information about the putative site of active replication. Another commonly used method is the labelling of newly synthesized viral RNA with 5-bromouridine 5\u2032 triphosphate. This brominated ribonucleotide is an excellent substrate for RNA polymerases, and replaces the natural substrate uridine diphosphate. To specifically label viral RNA, it is necessary to inhibit cellular polymerases using actinomycin D before and during the labelling process. The labelled viral RNA can be localized using electron or immunofluorescence microscopy following labelling with an antibody that is directed against 5-bromouridine. Viral RNA can also be detected by in situ hybridization using single-stranded riboprobes. These probes can be directed against either the negative strand or the plus-strand of viral RNA, and thus it is possible to differentiate between these two RNA species. Virus-specific probes can be generated by either in vitro transcription or PCR. To facilitate detection of probes after in situ hybridization with the corresponding strand of virus RNA, the probes must be labelled with a substance against which a specific antibody is available. A commonly used marker for labelling is digoxigenin, which is conjugated to a single species of RNA nucleotide triphosphate (typically uridine) and incorporated into the riboprobe during synthesis. ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) and their associated proteins were also shown to localize to the membranes that are modified by PV. ARFs are a family of small GTPases that play a central part in the regulation of membrane dynamics and protein transport. ARFs cycle between an active GTP-and an inactive GDP-bound form. In their active states, ARFs can initiate formation of a vesicular intermediate by inducing membrane curvature (discussed below) and attracting effectors that are required for vesicle formation. Activation of GDP-bound ARFs is mediated by so-called guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs), which form a transient complex with ARF-GDP 51 . ARF1 in particular is implicated in the recruitment of the COPI complex, which is involved in retrograde ER-Golgi transport. Biochemical and light-microscopy analyses showed that the PV non-structural proteins 3A and 3CD recruit the ARF-GEFs GBF1 and BIG1/2, respectively, which, in turn recruit ARF1, 3 and 5 to virus-induced membrane structures 52, 53 . ARF1 recruitment to membranes was shown to be required for viral replication in vitro, and was proposed to be involved in virus-induced membrane remodelling in vivo 53 . The putative involvement of components of both the anterograde and retrograde pathways, which are required for ER-Golgi trafficking, allows for a highly speculative model on the biogenesis of PV vesicle clusters. The use of COPII components could mediate the initial formation of the vesicle clusters that are formed from ER-derived transport intermediates. ARF1 or GBF1 recruitment could prevent COPI binding and consequently prevent recycling of membranes of the vesicles clusters back to the ER, thereby leading to a stable membrane compartment that supports viral replication (reviewed in detail in REF. 54 ).",

Consistent with this, and in contrast to PV, the interaction of coxsackievirus 3A with GBF1 is not essential for virus replication [55] [56] [57] . The interaction between coxsackievirus 3A and GBF1 instead seems to result in an inhibition of ER-Golgi transport. It has been known for some time that in both PV-and coxsackievirus-infected cells, ER-Golgi transport is blocked 58, 59 . For PV, ARF1 recruitment to membranes could underlie this inhibition by diverting GTPase from its normal function in ER-Golgi trafficking. For coxsackieviruses, however, the interaction of 3A with GBF1 actually inhibits ARF1 activation and membrane recruitment by stabilizing ARF-GEF GBF1 on membranes, thereby inhibiting ER-Golgi transport 15 . The interaction of both PV and coxsackievirus 3A with GBF1 could also explain the sensitivity of enterovirus infection to brefeldin A, as this drug is known to inhibit the activation and function of some GEFs [60] [61] [62] [63] . Therefore, although both PV and coxsackievirus 3A interact with ARF-GEFs, the function and mode of action of this interaction might be different.",

Early in infection, individual ER cisternae were found to be attracted to the replication site until it became almost entirely surrounded by the ER, and late in infection, when DNA-replication ceased, the ER typically dissociated from the replication site. It was proposed that a viral membrane protein is involved in the initial recruitment of ER cisternae and that their fusion to form a sealed double envelope around the DNA sites is mediated by the host cell ER-fusion machinery 77 ; however, further experiments are required to support this theory. Taken together, the findings discussed above indicate that viruses have evolved elaborate strategies to modify cellular mechanisms that are involved in vesiculation and transport for their own purposes. Although some cellular-interaction partners have been identified, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of membrane remodelling by viruses is still lacking.",

Curvature can also be induced by peripheral association of scaffolding proteins, such as coat proteins (reviewed in REFs 2, [78] [79] [80] (FIG. 3) . well-investigated examples are the coatomer proteins COPI and II, as well as clathrin (reviewed in REFs 2, 78) , which induce curvature of cellular membranes, followed by budding of vesicles from donor compartments. Of particular interest to this Review are proteins that have an amphipathic helix and internal \u03b1-helical stretches, which have one polar (charged) and one hydrophobic side; these proteins have the ability to associate with one of the two leaflets of a membrane, thereby creating asymmetry and membrane bending 79 (FIG. 4) . Viral factors could activate or recruit cellular components that are required for membrane bending. As described above, individual viral proteins of PV recruit ARFs and ARF-GEFs. Interestingly, ARFs contain an amino-terminal amphipathic helix and are able to induce membrane bending 81, 82 . PV therefore seems to recruit more than one cellular factor that has been shown to be implicated in membrane curvature to its RCs. Definitive proof that these cellular proteins mediate the curvature of PV vesicles is lacking. Moreover, as explained above for the coxsackieviruses, the involvement of ARF1 in membrane remodelling and curvature seems unlikely.",

            "text": "Alternatively, viral-replicase subunits could induce membrane curvature on their own, using mechanisms that are similar to those described for cellular proteins. Interestingly, a substantial number of viral proteins that are implicated in membrane-bound viral-RNA-replication (discussed above) seem to contain amphipathic helices [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] . PV protein 2C, as well as the Ns4A and Ns5A proteins of HCV, GBV and BVDV, which are involved in replication, also contain conserved amphipathic helices. One function of these sequences is to mediate membrane association of these proteins 84, 88 . Recent observations of HCV Ns4B suggest that such a sequence could also be involved in membrane bending or curvature 89 . Ns4B was shown to induce membrane alterations when expressed independently 17 and contains an amino-terminal amphipathic helix that might be required for the induction of membrane alterations. Ns4B has also been reported to form homo-oligomers that seem to be required for the induction of membrane alterations 89, 90 . Thus, analogous to the cellular process of membrane bending, a speculative model is that Ns4B induces curvature by inserting its amphipathic helix into membranes. Oligomerization might then lead to large complexes that force the membrane to remain curved. A similar mechanism could be used by the DENV and KuNV flavivirus Ns4A proteins, which can both induce membrane alterations 47, 48 . Flavivirus Ns4A contains a region that seems to span only one of the two lipid layers of the membrane, and has been proposed to form oligomers 46, 47 . Given that a large number of non-structural proteins of (+)RNA viruses contain amphipathic helices 91, 92 and are able to oligomerize, it is possible that this highly speculative model could also apply to other RNA viruses. An additional function of oligomerization could be to concentrate and cluster the non-structural proteins into a functional RC, such as that proposed for PV 93 . lyle et al. 93 found that membranous vesicles isolated from PV-infected cells were covered with a catalytic shell of oligomerized polymerase molecules, which might represent the site of RNA replication. The observed two-dimensional lattices of enzyme might act in an analogous way to surface catalysts.",

Nutrient-limiting conditions have been used extensively to dissect autophagy both at the morphological and molecular levels 94, 95 . Morphologically, the process starts with sequestration of the cytoplasmic content into a crescent-shaped double membrane. The origin of this membrane is debated, but it is probably derived from a specialized domain of the ER 96 . The crescent matures into double-membraned vesicles that enclose the cytoplasmic content, known as the autophagosome, which has a diameter of up to 1,500 nm in mammalian cells and 900 nm in yeast. upon fusion with late endosomes or lysosomes, the autophagosome acquires lysosomal enzymes that degrade its internal content. The molecules that are involved in autophagy have been dissected in detail using yeast genetics. At least 27 autophagy-related (Atg) genes have been identified in yeast. It is beyond the scope of this Review to describe the roles of Atg genes in detail (reviewed in REFs 94, 95) . However, two are worth mentioning: Atg5, a protein that is required for formation of the crescent membrane, and Atg8. Furthermore, the light-chain 3 (lC3) protein becomes lipidated in response to autophagy and is associated with the autophagosomal membrane 95 . A putative link between virus-induced vesicles and the process of autophagy was proposed many years ago by George Palade and colleagues 9 , who used EM studies to show that PV induced vesicles that resembled autophagosomal membranes.",

PV vesicle clusters have been shown to contain lC3 and lysosomal markers, suggesting the possible involvement of late steps of autophagy 45 . However, small-interfering-RNA (siRNA)mediated knockout of lC3 and Atg12, an Atg that forms a complex with Atg5, inhibited the release of infectious virus without significantly affecting replication 97 . These results inspired the authors to propose a scenario in which the PV replicative vesicles are involved in virus egress, a step that requires lC3 and Atg12 (REF. 97 ). In one study, lC3 was also shown to localize to coronavirus-induced vesicles 98 , but this could not be confirmed in two subsequent studies of sARs-CoV 22, 23 . Infection of cells that were derived from Atg5-knockout mice with the coronavirus MHV was shown to significantly affect virus yields, suggesting that initial stages of autophagy might be required for the production of infectious progeny 98 . Morphological similarities to the process of autophagy are particularly striking in two steps of the poxvirus replication cycle. The dynamics of ER wrapping around the sites of cytoplasmically synthesized viral DNA resembles the formation of autophagosomes: ER-derived cisternae are recruited to the cytoplasmic sites of replication and, eventually, almost entirely enclose the replication sites with a double membrane that is derived from the ER 32 . Another morphological similarity is observed during the assembly of new virions; for poxviruses, the precursor membrane of virus assembly is a crescent-shaped membrane that is ER derived and associates with cytoplasmically synthesized viral core proteins. These then form a spherical immature virion that is composed of a membrane which encloses cytoplasmic core proteins 99 . A recent study, however, showed that Atg5 is not required for the formation of infectious progeny virus, which provides compelling evidence against a role for autophagy in the vaccinia virus replication cycle 100 .",

Most of the viruses described in this Review encode one or more membrane proteins in the non-structural region of the viral genome, which ensures membrane-association of the RC. Examples include: the Ns4A and Ns4B proteins of DENV and HCV; FHV protein A; and PV 3A 47, 89, [101] [102] [103] . By analogy to cellular-membrane proteins, membrane association of these viral membrane proteins could occur via co-translational membrane insertion on ER-bound ribosomes. An exception seems to be the catalytic subunit of the HCV RdRp Ns5B. Ns5B contains a carboxyterminal hydrophobic region, and, similar to tail-anchored cellular proteins 104 , is inserted post-translationally into membranes 4 . Membrane-association of viral replication factors can also be mediated by an amphipathic helix, as shown for sFV NsP1 and HCV Ns4B and Ns5A 83, 85, 105, 106 . Membrane binding via lipid modifications has also been described (for example, palmitoylation of sFV NsP1) 107 . Viral non-structural proteins that lack membrane anchors associate with membranes through a tight interaction with viral-membrane-anchored proteins. Indeed, non-structural proteins of several viruses have been shown to exist in large complexes and, in many cases, protein-protein interactions of helicase and polymerase domains have been described [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] . As mentioned previously, the genomes of (+)RNA viruses are expressed as one or more polyproteins. This strategy evidently facilitates the targeting and assembly of all factors to the same location. strictly regulated processing events of the polyprotein may further contribute to the proper membrane-associated assembly of the RC. The importance of tightly regulated assembly is exemplified by the fact that it is difficult to trans-complement some proteins in the RCs of several (+)RNA viruses 113 .",

A closed vesicle structure implies that viral RNA is synthesized on, and localized to, the cytoplasmically oriented outer membrane, as the RNA is subsequently packaged by core proteins that are localized in the cytoplasm. In fact, nascent PV RNA and viral replication proteins are reported to be associated with the outside surfaces of virus-induced vesicles. Extensive studies have shown that viral RNA replication occurs in the space that is enclosed and surrounded by the cluster of induced-vesicle rosettes 11, 114, 115 . By contrast, it was proposed that the non-structural proteins and viral RNA of HCV are associated with the inner membrane of HCV induced vesicles 116 . These vesicles could contain a small, neck-like structure that allows the constant supply of nucleotides for RNA synthesis. Presumably, molecules that are larger than 16 kDa cannot pass through this neck owing to size limitations 116 (FIG. 5) . such neck-like connections have also been postulated for other viruses; for example, togaviruses, arteriviruses and nodaviruses 20, 33, 40 . Consequently, these vesicles could wrap the RC inside a membrane cisterna, thereby shielding it, but not closing it off, from the surrounding cytoplasm. Importantly, such a structure (known as an open membrane wrap) cannot be formed by single membrane structures, as these are inherently closed upon themselves; this might explain why several viruses from different families form DMVs for replication. Finally, putative neck-like structures could provide a means to regulate trafficking of molecules between the inside of the vesicle and the surrounding cytoplasm.",

To overcome this technical limitation, three-dimensional imaging using electron tomography is a useful tool. This method relies on tilting the EM sample and acquiring multiple two-dimensional images that are used to make a threedimensional model (reviewed in REF. 117 ). Indeed, in a recent study on FHV, electron tomography was used to analyse the viral RCs that are associated with mitochondria, and three-dimensional analyses revealed that each spherule maintains an open connection to the cytoplasm that has a diameter of approximately 10 nm 118 . (1), the viral genome is translated into a polyprotein that carries the structural (pink) and non-structural (green) proteins (2) . The viral non-structural protein NS4B induces the formation of membrane alterations, which serve as a scaffold for the assembly of the viral replication complex (RC) (3). The RC consists of viral non-structural proteins, viral RNA and host cell factors. Within the induced vesicles, viral RNA is amplified via a negative-strand RNA intermediate. Figure ",

Both genetic manipulation of viruses and cell-biology techniques, such as genome-wide siRNA screens 119 , will probably contribute to identification of the molecules that are involved in this process. Modern ultra-structural techniques, in particular electron tomography (discussed above), might substantially contribute to our understanding of the three-dimensional structure of viral membrane-bound RCs at the highest possible resolution. Electron tomography is also the method of choice to determine to what extent viral RCs are connected to each other and to other organelles, which could contribute to our understanding of the origin and biogenesis of virally induced RCs. If replicative membrane structures rely on the existence of pores or necks, important questions include: how are these structures formed and how do they regulate the transport of molecules into and out of the vesicle? Furthermore, such studies will increase our understanding of membrane dynamics and, hopefully, lead to new ways to combat viruses.",

(+)RNA viruses that belong to the Flaviviridae family and the Nidovirales order typically induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) -spherical membrane structures that are 50-400 nm in diameter (TAblEs 1,2) and composed of two closely apposed membrane bilayers (FIGs 2,3). The intracellular membrane rearrangements that are induced by the Flaviviridae family are best characterized for Kunjin virus (KuNV), which is the Australian variant of wNV18 . KuNV induces two distinct membrane structures (reviewed in detail in REF.6): large clusters of DMVs (each vesicle is approximately 50-150 nm in diameter) and a second membrane structure that consists of convoluted membranes and paracrystalline arrays. Immunolabelling studies that used an anti-double-stranded-RNA (dsRNA) antibody revealed that DMVs are the site of viral replication, whereas convoluted membranes are the sites of viral polyprotein processing19 . Clusters of DMVs have also been observed for other flaviviruses (for example, DENV)(FIG. 2c), but these have not been characterized in the same detail as for KuNV. For the coronavirus MHV and the arterivirus EAV, both of which are members of the Nidovirales order, newly synthesized RNA was found to localize to virus-induced DMVs 20,21 . These DMVs, which are approximately 80-160 nm in diameter,",
