            "text": "To investigate the mechanisms of SRSF7 homeostasis, we generated cell lines SRSF7 is an essential RNA-binding protein whose misexpression promotes cancer. Here, we describe how SRSF7 maintains its protein homeostasis in murine P19 cells using an intricate negative feedback mechanism. SRSF7 binding to its premessenger RNA promotes inclusion of a poison cassette exon and transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). However, elevated SRSF7 levels inhibit NMD and promote translation of two protein halves, termed Split-ORFs, from the bicistronic SRSF7-PCE transcript. The first half acts as dominant-negative isoform suppressing poison cassette exon inclusion and instead promoting the retention of flanking introns containing repeated SRSF7 binding sites. Massive SRSF7 binding to these sites and its oligomerization promote the assembly of large nuclear bodies, which sequester SRSF7 transcripts at their transcription site, preventing their export and restoring normal SRSF7 protein levels. We further show that hundreds of human and mouse NMD targets, especially RNA-binding proteins, encode potential Split-ORFs, some of which are expressed under specific cellular conditions. SRSF7 binding promotes splicing of NMD-sensitive and -resistant SRSF7 isoforms. To understand the mechanism of SRSF7 auto-regulation, we examined the binding of SRSF7 protein to SRSF7 transcripts using individual-nucleotide resolution ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP). We used normalized significant crosslink events (X-links, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) from SRSF3 and SRSF7 iCLIP datasets of P19 cell lines without OE 8 . Similar to SRSF3, which promotes the inclusion of the PCE in SRSF7 transcripts 17 , SRSF7 showed enriched crosslinks in an extended region encompassing the PCE, its flanking introns 3a and 3b, and exons 3, 4 and 5 (Fig. 1d ). Quantification revealed that SRSF7 binds ~50-fold more to SRSF7 transcripts than SRSF3 (Supplementary Table 1 ), indicating that SRSF7 has an unusual preference for its own transcripts.",

Indeed, NMD inhibition using cycloheximide (CHX) increased SRSF7-PCE and SRSF7-PCE 1/4 levels in wild-type (WT) cells, confirming that they are bona fide NMD targets (Fig. 1f) . However, in SRSF7 OE cells, SRSF7-PCE transcript levels were not increased by CHX treatment, which was validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with reverse transcription (Fig. 1g) . Cytoplasmicnuclear fractionation confirmed that both PCE-containing isoforms are exported to the cytoplasm, but whereas SRSF7-PCE 1/4 is degraded by NMD, SRSF7-PCE is NMD-resistant ( Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e) . Intron-containing isoforms SRSF7-I3a+b and SRSF7-I3b were also NMD-resistant, probably due to their nuclear retention. NMD was not globally compromised in SRSF7 OE cells since SRSF7-PCE 1/4 was stabilized by CHX to the same extent in WT and SRSF7 OE cells (Fig. 1g) . These results hint at a multilayered auto-regulatory mechanism, where SRSF7 OE promotes the generation of various SRSF7 transcript isoforms that are NMD-sensitive (SRSF7-PCE 1/4 ) or NMD-resistant (SRSF7-PCE).",

This SRSF7 variant contains only the RNAbinding module (RRM + Zn) and a unique C terminus but lacks the RS domain and was termed SRSF7_RRM (Extended Data Fig. 2a) . Indeed, western blots (WBs) using an antibody against the RRM of SRSF7 revealed a protein of ~16 kDa upon SRSF7 OE (Fig. 2a) . This protein was not detectable using the antibody mAb104 for phosphorylated RS domains 24 . SRSF7_RRM was also detectable at low levels in WT cells and accumulated upon NMD inhibition by UPF1 knockdown (KD) (Extended Data Fig. 2b) . Stringent immunoprecipitation (IP) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/ MS) analyses confirmed the presence of peptides mapping to the RRM and the unique C terminus of SRSF7_RRM (Fig. 2b-d) . Furthermore, ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) revealed the presence of ribosome-protected fragments mapping to the exon 3-PCE junction, confirming that SRSF7-PCE transcripts undergo translation and that SRSF7_RRM is produced from these transcripts (Fig. 2e , Extended Data Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 2) .",

Translation initiation from the 3\u2032 most AUG codon within the PCE would resume the original open reading frame (ORF) and generate a second polypeptide comprising the entire RS domain with 11 additional N-terminal amino acids, termed SRSF7_RS ( Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2a) . This polypeptide was indeed detectable in SRSF7 OE cells using both anti-GFP and mAb104 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 2d ,e, pink asterisk). MS/MS analyses after IP confirmed the presence of peptides mapping to the junction between the RS domain and the GFP tag (Extended Data Fig. 2f,g) , although few peptides mapped to the RS domain itself and none to the unique 11-amino acid N terminus. This is likely due to the low abundance of this protein, small peptide sizes and the high charge and repetitive nature of RS domains. The in-frame start codon of SRSF7_RS is ultraconserved in mammals and the same protein halves would also arise from translation of the human SRSF7-PCE isoform (Extended Data Fig. 2h ). Altogether, our data reveal that upon PCE inclusion, the resulting transcript encodes two SRSF7 protein halves (referred to as Split-ORFs).",

The usage of splice sites in pre-mRNAs is determined by serine-and arginine-rich (SR) proteins, a family of essential RBPs comprising 12 members (SRSF1-SRSF12) 2 . SR proteins contain one or two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and bind to specific sequences within exons, promoting their inclusion by recruiting the spliceosome to nearby splice sites. This recruitment is mediated by their arginine-and serine-rich (RS) domain, a low-complexity C-terminal region enriched in serine-arginine dipeptides that interacts with spliceosomal proteins; for example, U170K or U2AF2 (ref. 3 ).",

Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) encoding C-terminally green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged SRSF7 (or SRSF3 as control) were integrated into diploid mouse P19 cells (Fig. 1a) , and clonal cell lines with overexpression (OE) were derived by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 8 .

Translation of Split-ORF2 would ensure that translating ribosomes reach the end of the ORF, thereby removing all exon-exon junction complexes (EJCs). SRSF7 binding to the PCE might promote translation of Split-ORF2 as it shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm 26 and was previously shown to promote the translation of unspliced viral and reporter transcripts 9, 27 . To test where SRSF7 binds in SRSF7-PCE transcripts when they undergo translation, we performed iCLIP on monosomal and polysomal fractions (piCLIP) 26 (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 2i,j) . piCLIP reads were virtually absent from coding exons of SRSF7, consistent with efficient translation of the ORF and removal of SRSF7 by translating ribosomes, but two abundant crosslink peaks were present upstream of the AUG of SRSF7_RS (Fig. 2f , green arrows, and Supplementary Table 3 ). This raises the possibility that SRSF7 binding promotes translation of Split-ORF2, thereby protecting SRSF7-PCE transcripts from NMD.

IP efficiency was verified by WB, and uncrosslinked samples and unspecific antibodies served as controls (Extended Data Fig. 3c ). The presence of radioactively labeled RNA-protein complexes between 15 and 35 kDa whose abundance increased upon SRSF7 OE indicated that SRSF7_RRM indeed binds to RNA (Fig. 3b) . We found similar consensus binding motifs for endogenous SRSF7, SRSF7-GFP and SRSF7_RRM (GAYGAY) (Fig. 3c ) and all three proteins bound SRSF7 transcripts to a similar extent (Supplementary Table 4 ), indicating that SRSF7_RRM has a similar RNA-binding specificity and affinity as full-length SRSF7. Moreover, all SRSF7 variants bound near the 5\u2032 splice sites of introns 3a, 3b and 5, which all remain partly unspliced on SRSF7 OE, while other introns are efficiently spliced (Fig. 3d , green arrows). However, SRSF7_RRM lacked the strong binding peak of full-length SRSF7 (WT and OE) and SRSF7-GFP near the 3\u2032 splice site of intron 3a (black arrow), expected to promote PCE inclusion.",

RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) using probes specific for introns 3 and 5 detected one to three large foci per nucleus that colocalized with SRSF7-GFP accumulations (Fig. 4a ,b and Extended Data Fig. 4d ). The number of observed foci indicates that SRSF7-I3+5 transcripts accumulate at transcription sites of exogenous and endogenous SRSF7 alleles.

SRSF7 is found in paraspeckles and nuclear speckles 30 ; however, SRSF7 bodies are unlikely to constitute a subpopulation of those nuclear bodies, since (1) pluripotent P19 cells do not contain any paraspeckles (Extended Data Fig. 4e ), and (2) nearly half of SRSF7 bodies do not colocalize with the nuclear speckle marker Malat1 (Extended Data Fig. 4f ).",

SRSF7-GFP and SRSF7_RRM-GFP formed larger bead aggregates compared to GFP alone, likely caused by simultaneous binding to RNA molecules within the lysates (Fig. 5c) . Addition of in vitro-transcribed SRSF7 PCE RNA that contains ~34 predicted SRSF7 binding sites (Extended Data Fig. 5b ) produced super-aggregates of beads coated with SRSF7-GFP but not SRSF7_ RRM-GFP, indicating that oligomerization via the RS domain drives aggregation.

Very few SRSF7-I3+5 isoforms were detectable, and SRSF7 bodies were drastically diminished and showed poor colocalization with SRSF7-mutZn protein (Fig. 6d-f and Extended Data Fig. 6d-h) . To verify the altered RNA-binding specificity of SRSF7_mutZn, we performed iCLIP (Extended Data Fig. 6i and Supplementary Table 6 ). SRSF7 and SRSF7_mutZn showed 84% overlap in bound target transcripts, but SRSF7_mutZn crosslinked more to introns and less to exons (Extended Data Fig. 6j,k) . The binding motif of SRSF7_mutZn changed from purine-rich GAYGAY triplets to pyrimidine-rich CNYC motifs, similar to the SRSF3 binding motif (Fig. 6g) , indicating that its RNA-binding specificity is now determined exclusively by its RRM, which is highly similar to the RRM of SRSF3 (ref. 38 ).

To test this hypothesis, we used BAC recombineering to mutate the in-frame AUG (Fig. 6h) .

Split-ORF genes were enriched for the gene ontology terms 'RNA binding' and 'mRNA processing' , and among the significantly enriched protein domains were known RNA-binding domains, such as zinc-finger and RRM domains and WD40 repeats ( Fig. 7d and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 ), indicating that many RBPs have the potential to express Split-ORFs. Two scenarios for the generation of Split-ORFs were common: the inclusion of an alternative exon, for example an ultraconserved PCE that provides a STOP and a downstream in-frame START codon, or the skipping of an alternative exon that generates a frameshift and a PTC in close proximity. In the latter case, a downstream in-frame START codon already present in the original ORF would be used.",

            "text": "Interesting examples of RBP-encoding genes that generate Split-ORFs include several SR proteins (SRSF5, SRSF6, SRSF9 and SRSF10) as well as BCLAF1, HNRNPL, MAGOHB, PRPF39, RBM39, DDX3X, TIAL1 and U2AF1L4 (Supplementary Table 7) . To test whether these RBPs express Split-ORFs under some conditions, we followed three different strategies. First, we generated P19 cell lines overexpressing either SRSF5-or SRSF6-GFP. WB using specific antibodies revealed that the levels of endogenous proteins were strongly decreased in the OE samples, indicative of auto-regulation (Fig. 7e) . In both cases additional protein bands appeared whose sizes would fit the predicted Split-ORFs (Extended Data Fig. 7c) . Second, we inspected binding of RBPs to their own NMD transcripts using available eCLIP and iCLIP data [39] [40] [41] . In several cases, such as BCLAF1, TIAL1, SRSF5, SRSF6 and HNRNPL, a conserved PCE that generates Split-ORFs was massively bound by the encoded RBP (Fig. 7f, data not shown) . This indicates that this NMD isoform is made, stably detectable and possibly involved in an auto-regulatory feedback mechanism. Third, to assess whether some of the predicted Split-ORFs are translated in a physiological context, we interrogated publicly available Ribo-Seq data from mouse hearts 42 , 17Cl-1 cells infected with murine coronavirus, human cardiomyocytes 42 , A549 cells infected with Dengue virus and human embryonic kidney 293 cells 43 . We selected RBPencoding transcripts where insertion of a unique NMD exon gives rise to Split-ORFs and counted Ribo-Seq footprint reads mapping to these exons. We identified 29 RBPs with at least two footprint reads within their Split-ORF-encoding NMD exon in mouse and 19 RBPs in human datasets (Fig. 7g, Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Table 10 ). Among those, SRSF5, SRSF6, SRSF7, BCLAF1, HNRNPL, PRPF39 and TIAL1 were found in both species. Our data indicate that PCE location, sequence and Split-ORF coding potential are conserved between mouse and human and widespread among multi-domain RBPs. Split-ORF translation would represent an intriguing mechanism to rescue transcripts from NMD and thereby generate distinct protein isoforms or contribute to the regulation of RBP expression. The individual mechanisms and functions require further studies. Bead aggregation assays were performed with magnetic beads coupled to \u03b1-GFP antibodies that immunoprecipitated GFP, SRSF7-GFP or SRSF7_RRM-GFP from P19 cell lysates.

At low levels, SRSF7 binds the SRSF7 pre-mRNA in both exons flanking the PCE and promotes its skipping, thereby producing functional SRSF7 protein (Fig. 8, upper panel) . Upon transient OE, SRSF7 binds to splice sites within the PCE and promotes its inclusion. PTC-containing SRSF7-PCE transcripts perform two different functions: normally they are NMD-sensitive and rapidly degraded in the cytoplasm, thereby decreasing the levels of functional SRSF7 protein (Fig. 8, middle panel) . However, sustained SRSF7 OE, for example after oncogenic transformation, protects SRSF7-PCE transcripts from NMD. Under such conditions, they become bicistronic mRNAs encoding two SRSF7 protein halves, here termed Split-ORFs. Split-ORF1 is translated into SRSF7_RRM, which acts as a dominant-negative form of SRSF7 (Fig. 8, lower  panel) . It retains its RNA-binding specificity and nuclear localization but cannot recruit the spliceosome due to its missing RS domain. SRSF7_RRM can easily outcompete full-length SRSF7 as it is not stored in nuclear speckles and therefore readily available. Within SRSF7 pre-mRNA, it inhibits PCE inclusion and promotes retention of introns 3a, 3b and 5. The intron-containing SRSF7-I3+5 transcripts are sequestered in the nucleus and act as architectural RNAs (arcRNAs). Massive binding of SRSF7 and its oligomerization assemble large nuclear bodies at SRSF7 transcription sites (Fig. 8, lower panel) , which sequester intron-retained but likely also fully spliced SRSF7 mRNAs. This results in a reduction of translatable SRSF7 transcripts in the cytoplasm and functional SRSF7 protein in the nucleus and ultimately restores normal SRSF7 levels.",

Oligomerization between SRSF7 proteins bound to distinct SRSF7-I3+5 transcripts likely triggers the formation of large nuclear bodies that undergo phase separation 35 . In line with this, SRSF7 bodies consist of multiple SRSF7-containing RNPs that are held together by weak hydrophobic interactions. Their assembly depends on transcription and their size correlates with the levels of SRSF7-I3+5 and the oligomerization capacity of SRSF7.

Alternatively, leaky scanning, ribosome shunting or initiation at an internal ribosomal entry site might cause ribosomes to skip the normal translation start site and initiate at the AUG within the PCE 50, 51 . The detection of an N-terminally truncated SRSF7 peptide (SRSF7_RS-GFP), the conserved START codon in a strong Kozak context (ACCAUGG) and the presence of Ribo-Seq reads at the AUG (Figs. 2e and 7g) indicate that translation initiation might occur downstream of the PTC. Translation of Split-ORF2 resumes the original reading frame and would allow ribosomes to remove all EJCs, thereby rendering SRSF7-PCE transcripts NMD-resistant and allowing for bulk translation of Split-ORF1. Indeed, translational read-through and reinitiation have been shown to rescue transcripts from NMD [52] [53] [54] . Patients with nonsense mutations in genes causing several diseases have been shown to express NMD-resistant PTC-containing transcripts. In all cases, reinitiation at an AUG downstream of the PTC caused the expression of an N-terminally truncated protein, which delayed the symptoms or acted as a dominant-negative variant [55] [56] [57] [58] .

If PCE inclusion only served to introduce PTCs and create unstable NMD transcripts, PCEs could be inserted anywhere in pre-mRNAs. However, a similar gene organization is found in SRSF5 and SRSF6, where PCE inclusion also generates Split-ORFs that separate RRM and RS domains. Moreover, the PCE of SRSF7 is 99% conserved between mouse and human, which is significantly higher than any coding exon of SRSF7 (ref. 15 ). Regulation of PCE inclusion and translation initiation would require high conservation only around the splice sites, the PTC and the downstream AUG, not within the middle region. However, our data indicate that sequence-specific binding of SRSF7 along the entire PCE is required for proper auto-regulation of SRSF7. Thus, the similar PCE organization for other SR proteins and the ultraconservation of PCE length, sequence and location indicate additional roles, such as the assembly of nuclear bodies.",

Moreover, the reversible sequestration of functional SRSF7 transcripts and SRSF7 proteins in nuclear bodies provides a fast way to adjust protein levels when cellular conditions change. The nuclear-retained SRSF7-I3+5 isoforms might be spliced posttranscriptionally to increase protein expression when conditions become more favorable 60, 61 . Ultimately, this regulatory mechanism could also represent an antiviral defense, since several viruses inactivate NMD and hijack SRSF7 for processing and translating their transcripts 9,62-65 .

Sorted .bam files were visualized using the integrated genomics viewer (http://software.broadinstitute. org/software/igv/). Splice junctions on the SRSF7 gene were visualized and counted using the Sashimi plot function. SRSF7 IP, sample preparation and MS analysis. Truncated and full-length SRSF7 isoforms were purified from WT and OE cells by stringent IPs as follows. Briefly, cells grown on 14-cm culture dishes were washed in ice-cold PBS and pelleted. For stringent IPs 100 \u00b5l beads (Dynabeads Protein G, ThermoFisher Scientific, 10004D) were washed twice with 800 \u00b5l lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4) and resuspended in 200 \u00b5l lysis buffer. Beads were incubated with 5 \u00b5l rabbit IgG \u03b1-SRSF7 (Assay Biotech C18943) or 12 \u00b5g goat IgG \u03b1-GFP antibodies (provided by D. Drechsel, MPI-CBG) on a rotating wheel at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. Rabbit or goat IgGs (Sigma) served as specificity controls. Beads were washed once with 800 \u00b5l high-salt buffer (1 M NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4), twice with 800 \u00b5l lysis buffer and suspended in cell lysates prepared as follows. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma) and 10 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate (Fluka BioChemica) and sonicated on ice for 30 s (3 pulses of 10 s at 20-s intervals) at 20% amplitude (Branson W-450 D, ThermoFisher Scientific). Lysates were treated with Invitrogen TURBO DNase (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C and were cleared by centrifugation (17,000g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C). Beads were incubated with cell lysates for 1.5 h at 4 \u00b0C on a rotating wheel, washed three times with 800 \u00b5l high-salt buffer, twice with 800 \u00b5l lysis buffer and resuspended in 25 \u00b5l Laemmli buffer. Samples were heated at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min and beads were separated from eluates on a magnetic rack for 1 min. Eluates were subjected SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained overnight in a colloidal Coomassie solution (0.08% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250, 10% citric acid, 8% ammonium sulfate, 20% methanol) and destained with distilled water. Protein bands and size-matched empty controls were cut and digested with Trypsin/LysC, LysC or Chymotrypsin (Promega) overnight and analyzed by liquid chromatography-MS.",

Fluorescence signal was detected with an Argon laser (GFP, 488 nm excitation, Qasar 570-561 nm excitation and Qasar 670-647 nm excitation). Line scans were performed using the line scan and fluorescence measure from ZEN 2012 (black edition v.8.0.5.273; Zeiss) software using the Profile definition tool (arrow) (manually pointed through the target signal) and the results in distance (x axis) in pixels to intensity (y axis) were depicted in graphs.Fiji was used to process and analyze all acquired images 72 . Pictures were cropped with the Image crop function and scale bars were added. For the quantification of number, size and fluorescence intensity of SRSF7 bodies, fields with similar numbers of cells were captured using Z-stacks until at least 100 cells were obtained. The BioVoxxel plugin was used to generate a sum of slides image (Sum) from the Intron 3, Intron 5 or Hoechst channel Z-stacks. Intron 3/5 and Hoechst images were merged and the number of bodies per nucleus was counted using the three-dimensional object counter. To obtain body area and fluorescence intensity the Particle analyzer plug in was first used to derive the regions of interest (ROI) from the bodies and subsequently area and fluorescence was quantified using the Area and Integrated density value (mean gray value per pixel \u00d7 area), respectively. Area and fluorescence values were plotted with GraphPad Prism. For Malat1 colocalization slices from the Intron 5 Z-stacks and MALAT1 channels were merged and at least 100 bodies were investigated for colocalization. For representative images, the ROI from SRSF7 bodies were generated as described above and transferred to the MALAT1 channel.

For protein analysis, 20 \u03bcl of each fraction were mixed with 5\u00d7 Laemmli buffer, separated on a 4-12% NuPAGE gradient gel (Life Technologies), and analyzed by WB using an \u03b1-GFP antibody. For each replicate, fractions 5-6 were pooled for the monosomal fraction and 7-10 for the polysomal fraction. The pooled fractions were separated in two and diluted in iCLIP lysis buffer to a final volume of 50 ml. One half was incubated with Protein G Dynabeads (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled with a goat \u03b1-GFP antibody (D. Drechsel, MPI-CBG) and the other half with goat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) as control. After IP, iCLIP was performed according to ref. 66 . The final cDNA libraries were amplified using Phusion HF Master Mix and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument (single-end 75-nt reads, 15 million reads per replicate, three replicates). Subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was performed using a fractionation kit for Protein and RNA (Abcam) according to the manufacturer's recommendations with slight modifications. Buffer A was supplemented with 1 U ml \u22121 RNaseOut for RNA samples and with 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor and 10 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate (Fluka BioChemica) for protein samples.Northern blot. We mixed 2-6 \u00b5g RNA with 2\u00d7 RNA sample buffer (Thermo Scientific), preheated it at 60 \u00b0C for 10 min and separated it on a denaturing agarose gel (1-3%) supplemented to 5% formaldehyde and 1\u00d7 MOPS buffer. The RNA integrity was verified by staining total RNA with SYBR Gold (Thermo Scientific) and determined by the 28S:18S rRNA ratio. Blotting was performed overnight in 20\u00d7 SSC buffer on a 0.1 \u00b5m charged nylon membrane (GE Healthcare). After RNA crosslinking (at 120 mJ cm \u22122 ), the membranes were preincubated with ULTRA Hybridization buffer (Ambion) for 30 min at 42 \u00b0C. RNA probe synthesis was performed by PCR and DIG-dUTP (Roche) incorporation. Denatured probes (95 \u00b0C for 5 min) were added to the membranes in hybridization buffer and rotated for 14-24 h at 42 \u00b0C. The membranes were washed two times with 2\u00d7 SSC + 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 42 \u00b0C and twice with 0.1\u00d7 SSC + 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 42 \u00b0C. After swirling the membrane in washing buffer (0.3% Tween20 in Maleic acid, pH 7.5), the membrane was blocked (1% blocking reagent in maleic acid, pH 7.5) (Roche) for 30 min at room temperature. To detect the RNA probe, the membrane was incubated with Anti-DIG fab fragment (0.005% in blocking solution) (Roche) for 30 min. After washing two times 15 min with washing buffer, the membrane was incubated with detection solution (100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl 2 , pH 9.5) (Roche). Then, 0.07% CDP Star in detection buffer was added and chemiluminescence was recorded by a ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad) in High Sensitivity mode.",

            "text": "A Split-ORF pipeline was developed for the prediction of ORFs resulting from the translation of NMD transcripts. For this, all annotated NMD transcripts were obtained from the Ensembl database (v.95) using Biomart resulting in 6,996 mouse and 16,141 human sequences. First, NMD transcripts were translated in silico from the forward strand only allowing three possible reading frames. Second, all peptides with a minimal length of 50 amino acids were aligned with BlastP using local alignments 74 against all proteins of the respective species using Ensembl proteins (v.95). All alignments with an E value \u226410 were retained. Third, all NMD transcripts were kept, which generate at least two peptides that align to the same protein sequence. Predicted ORFs were required to align with at least 50% of their sequence length and with at least 90% sequence identity to the Ensembl proteins. Both filters avoided short spurious ORF matches that were false positives. Fourth, after filtering, NMD transcripts with at least two matching ORFs were tested for encoded protein domains, by overlapping the ORF locations with annotated PFAM domains in Ensembl proteins 75 . Only PFAM domains that overlapped completely with matching ORFs were considered. To derive orthologous human and mouse genes we used the Biomart (Ensembl v.95). Fisher's Exact test was used to compute enrichment of a PFAM domain type using all genes with NMD transcripts as background. P values were corrected using FDR in R and an FDR \u2264 0.05 was considered significant. Gene-ontology enrichment of the identified NMD gene sets were conducted using the functional annotation tool of the DAVID webserver (https://david. ncifcrf.gov). Enriched categories with a corrected P \u2264 0.001 (Benjamini-Hochberg) were considered significant.The Split-ORF prediction pipeline is implemented using python, available under https://github.com/SchulzLab/SplitOrfs.To count Ribo-Seq reads within unique NMD exons in RBP genes, we downloaded four Ribo-Seq datasets from mouse (SRA IDs: ERR3367717, ERR3367718, ERX1264382) and four from human (SRA IDS: SRR9332878, SRX3849510, ERX3391949, ERX339195) and aligned them using STAR. The junction index was built using the reference genome sequence and Ensembl gene annotations (v.95). Genomic regions of unique NMD exons were intersected with BAM alignments using bedtools 76 , counting only reads with a minimal alignment overlap of 20% of the read length with the unique NMD exon.
