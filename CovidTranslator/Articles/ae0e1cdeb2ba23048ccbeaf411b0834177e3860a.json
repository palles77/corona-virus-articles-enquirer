            "text": "Background: Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a double-stranded DNA virus associated with respiratory tract infections (RTI) in children. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, HAdV often is detected together with other virus species, even in healthy controls. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare molecular detection of HAdV with culture, and to examine the associations of various methods to RTI. Study design: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from 4319 children admitted with RTI and from 361 controls. The NPAs were examined for 23 viral and bacterial pathogens, using inhouse real-time PCR-assays based on TaqMan probes, in addition to bacterial and viral culture. HAdV concentration was evaluated semiquantitatively from the Ct-value and quantitatively by use of ADENOVIRUS R-gene\u00ae. Results: HAdV-DNA was detected in 6.1% patient samples and in 10.5% controls (p < 0.001). Compared to controls, patients had an OR of 3.8 (95% CI 1.4-10.3) for mono-detection of HAdV DNA, and an OR of 5.1 (95% CI 2.0-13.4) for HAdV-positive samples grew adenovirus by culture. HAdV DNA loads from children with RTI consisted of two clusters: one cluster with high viral loads (Ct < 30 and > 106 copies/ml) and one cluster with low viral loads, whereas among the controls, nearly all had low viral loads (OR 7.8, 95% CI 2.2-27.1). In 61 available plasma samples, 16.4% were positive for HAdV DNA, all were from patients. Conclusion: The detection of HAdV DNA per se by qualitative PCR is not useful as a diagnostic test. Detection of HAdV by use of viral culture and a high viral HAdV DNA load are the two methods most strongly associated with RTI in children.",

            "text": "Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a double-stranded DNA virus and a common pathogen among children and adults. HAdV belongs to the Adenoviridae family and the Mastadenovirus genus. The link between HAdVs and respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is well established [1] [2] [3] , especially in children and military recruits. They may also cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis and gastroenteritis. More rarely, HAdV infections may lead to haemorrhagic cystitis [4, 5] . Severe disease in immunodeficient patients, children and elderly has also been documented [6] [7] [8] . Infections with adenovirus may occur sporadically or in epidemics and can be detected throughout the year. However, it is a well-known phenomenon that asymptomatic shedding can occur [9, 10] . Until now more than 52 HAdV types have been identified and further classified into seven species (A-G). The different types were initially defined by serum neutralisation methods as serotype, but are now identified based on molecular methods and named as genotypes. New genotypes are still identified [8, [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

Viral culture is labour intensive and does not provide a fast answer for clinical decision-making, but we think that it is a useful laboratory tool for the evaluation of nucleic-acid based methods. Approximately half of the HAdV DNA positive NPAs collected from children with RTI were also positive by virus isolation, and we suggest that this indication of live viral particles support that active adenoviral infection was present. In addition, many of these samples with HAdV growth had high viral loads. More than 9 of 10 NPA samples with high viral load above 10 6 copies/ml, were collected from children with RTI. Hence, a positive HAdV culture result and the detection of high HAdV level above 10 6 copies/ml s are good indicators of RTI in children, whereas a positive HAdV PCR qualitative test result alone does not indicate RTI. Indeed, we showed that nasopharyngeal samples from children with RTI consisted of two clusters: one cluster with high viral loads (Ct < 30) and one cluster with low vial loads (Ct > 30) whereas among the controls, nearly all had low viral loads and clustered below this threshold value. It has been reported previously that HAdV may be excreted for long time or even may increase excretion again in association with a new infection [10, 20, 27] , and these phenomena may explain the findings of low HAdV levels in many infected as well as in many healthy children included in our study.",

Due to the inclusion of a control group of healthy children, we were also able to correlate viral findings with RTI. However, due to the cross-sectional design, we didn't evaluate clinical sensitivity exactly. A longitudinal study with repeated samplings from each child would also be better to study viral concentrations in relation to various clinical manifestations. Furthermore, the study was hospital based, and hence the included children do not represent the entire spectrum of adenoviral infections. There were significant age and gender differences between the patient and control groups, but this was controlled for in the analyses.",
