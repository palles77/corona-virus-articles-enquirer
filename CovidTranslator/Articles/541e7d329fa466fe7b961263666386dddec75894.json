An objective estimation of the probability of cases arising in the future is important to reduce the risk of post-declaration flare-ups. We developed a simulationbased model to quantify that probability. We tested it on simulated Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) data and found this probability was most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the delay between symptom onset and recovery or death of the last detected case. For EVD, our results suggest that the current WHO criterion of 42 days since the outcome of the last detected case is too short and very sensitive to underreporting. The 90 days of enhanced surveillance period after the end-of-outbreak declaration is therefore crucial to capture potential flare-ups of cases. Hence, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This should be followed by a 90-day enhanced surveillance, after which the official end-ofoutbreak can be declared. This corresponds to less than 5% probability of flare ups in most of the scenarios examined. Our quantitative framework could be adapted to define end-of-outbreak criteria for other infectious diseases.",

In defining the EO, it is crucial to consider the risk of cases arising in the future using objective quantitative methods. A well-timed declaration of EO is essential as it would allow affected countries to address problems in other sectors, reallocate healthcare resources to cover other important public health issues, and start post-outbreak recovery efforts.",

We retrieved examples of EO criteria from various pathogens and institutions from the literature ( Table 1) . Most of these criteria are obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines or decided by a government's Ministry of Health or public health authorities. The most commonly used EO criterion is a period of twice the longest incubation period without observing any new cases since the last possible transmission event (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . In an Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak context, the EO of EVD is declared after 42 days (twice the longest incubation period) has passed since the outcome of the last case. There are several possible scenarios of the outcome of the last case (8) . If the last case is a laboratory-confirmed case, the outcome can be the second PCR negative test of blood samples or a safe burial if the person died. Additionally, if the last case is a contact of a confirmed case, the outcome is a safe burial after the person's death.",

Hence, further development of quantitative techniques to define the EO is urgently needed. In this study, we developed a simulation-based method to calculate the probability of cases arising in the future after the outcome of the last detected case. We account for factors that influence the estimated probability such as the underlying reproduction number, the reporting rate and the delay between the onset and the outcome of the last detected case, which for simplicity we will refer to as 'the onset-to-outcome delay period'. We tested our method on several EVD outbreak scenarios. Finally, we used the simulation results to propose a new quantitative criterion to define the EO for EVD. ",

Hence, for outbreaks with low reporting rates, a longer waiting time would be needed to declare the EO. However, we found that the dependency on the reporting rate became negligible as the onset-to-outcome delay period decreases. This suggests that using the onset day, rather than the outcome day, as the baseline of the waiting time should be considered as it may be more robust to variability in the outbreak context. This would also account for the three possible scenarios for the last detected case which could include any delays in testing of the last detected case or delays in burial (8) .",

However, given the sensitivity of the probability of cases arising in the future to the value of , it is difficult to suggest a single criterion for EO irrespective of . Based on our results we therefore make three general recommendations: i) a shift from counting down to EO from 42 days from the day of outcome to 63 days from the day of onset of the last detected case leading to a preliminary EO declaration; ii) emphasis on the importance of properly resourcing the enhanced 90-day surveillance post-EO declaration to ensure that any flareups are quickly detected and controlled before the final EO declaration (63 + 90 days after the onset of the last detected case); and iii) regular estimation and re-estimation of the reproduction number particularly in the decline phase.",

The framework developed did not consider additional cases that arise from less common transmission routes such as migration, sexual transmission, and immunocompromised pregnant women. These caveats make the current policy to keep active case detection up to 90 days after the EO declaration essential if the framework and model were to be adopted. Although the framework accounts for superspreading (by allowing overdispersion in the offspring distribution), we did not explicitly model superspreading events in the context of unsafe burial practices that lead to large-scale funeral exposures (30, 38) . Nevertheless, the work presented here demonstrates the value of the development of a quantitative framework than can be used to help decision-makers to objectively assess the risk of flare-ups of cases after the EO declaration.

Outbreaks were simulated using the project function from the projections package in the R software, assuming either Poisson or negative binomial offspring distributions to allow for overdispersion (or superspreading, whereby a few cases are responsible for a large proportion of infections) (28). The statistical formulation of the outbreak simulations is as follows: ~ ( ) or ~ ( , ), where is the number of new cases arising (based on symptom",

After that period, stochastic simulations were run using the model described above. The serial interval was assumed to be gamma distributed with a mean of 15.3 days and a standard deviation of 9.3 days (27). For the negative binomial simulations, the overdispersion parameter was set to values in the range 0.03-0.52, consistent with estimates from the West African EVD epidemic (30,31). We assumed varied over time, with the outbreak divided into three phases: growth, peak, and decline. The 'growth' period included the initial 30 days, with an of 1.7 (within the range of Van Kerkhove et al. (27) estimates) and was assumed to last for a total of 90 days. In the 'peak' period, assumed to last for 40 days, we used = 1.0. The 'decline' period, with values in the range of 0.3-0.9, lasted until the simulated outbreak trajectory had no more cases.
