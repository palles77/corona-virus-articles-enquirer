AlmXa~D~R and CoLLI~S (2) studied exhaustively the purification of the virus and their work indicates that 0304-8608/80/0063/0239/$ 02.60 the problem was not merely one of failure to produce sufficiently purified virus. STIYt~rA~ (20) suggested that studies using only polypeptide staining of gels may detect unincorporated host polypeptides which may be attached to virions. However almost identical profiles have been obtained using stained or aH-leueine labelled polypeptides (2) . STURMA~ (20) has also demonstrated that different concentrations of reducing agent and heating during preparation of coronavirus A59 polypeptides affected the number present and suggested that artifacts produced in this way may account for some of the polypeptides seen in studies of IBV. MAcNAuGH:rON and MA~)GE (15) have also stressed that the effect of harsh conditions during treatment of virus was to increase the number of polypeptides seen after polyaerylamide get electrophoresis (PAGE) and by such treatment were able to produce polypeptide profiles consisting of more than 12 bands. In the present, study we have examined the effects of the different conditions described by these authors on the polypeptide profile of the Massachusetts 41 strain of IBV.",

The quantitative variability of p 107 and p 75 can be most noticeably seen for the Holte, T and Connecticut strains. Apart from these variations, which were not strain specific, the major differences in the polypeptide patterns of the various strains were associated with the glyeopolypeptides. On most gels stained with Sehiff's reagent (Fig. 5) four bands were seen, two of these stained poorly but were similar for all strains and corresponded to polypeptides p107 and p54. On some gels an additional fifth area of faint Schiff's staining was detected which corresponded to a potypeptide of 6 5 , 0 0 0 7 0 , 0 0 0 molecular weight. All stra.ins showed two major glyeopolypeptides but the migration rates varied with strains. Of the six strains shown in Figures 4 and 5 , glyeopolypeptide p 31 was present in gels of M4i and Beaudette but in gels of the other four strains the lower molecular weight major glyeopolypeptide migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 27,000. Detection of differences in the migration of the higher molecular weight major glyeopolypeptide were complicated by the presence of non-glycosylated polypeptides in the 94,000 molecular weight area but careful analysis of 7.5 per SDS-PAGE of the viruses serotogicatly related to M41: H t20, H52, 927, 563 and 381 and the serologieally distinet SE t7 produced polypeptide profiles similar to that of M41 (Fig. 6, 563 and 38t not shown) . However, some variations in addition to those of p 107 and p75, were seen between the different strains. In particular H 120 showed both quantitative differences and a polypeptide of 49,000 moleeuIar weight which was not detected in other viruses (Fig. 6) . However SDS-PAGE followed by Schiff's staining revealed the major glyeopolypeptides of all six viruses to be of 86,000 and 31,000 molecular weight (Fig. 7, 381 not shown) .",

However a report by MAcNAuG~TO~ and MADGE (15) suggested only seven potypeptides for IBV. Several reasons for the differences in the number of polypeptides detected in early studies of IBV and those of other coronaviruses have been put forward. Failure to obtain purified virus and differences between radioisotope labelled and stained polypeptide patterns were discounted by work by ALEXANDm~ and COLLIZCS (2) . In the present study we have examined the different preparative conditions reported to cause variation in polypeptide pattern for IBV and eoronavirus A59 (15, 20) but have shown no differences in the number of polypeptides detected. In contrast to the results with A59 (20) our results with M41 showed that profiles of reduced and nonreduced polypeptides were different, and that both were unaffected by temperature.

The majority of the polypeptides detected in the present study represented very small proportions of the total protein and may simply not have been detected in other studies. MACNAuGI-ITOI~-and MADGE (15) reported the molecular weights of the seven polypeptides they detected by SDS-PAGE of IBV as: 130,000, 105,000, 97,000, 82,000, 74,000, 51,000 and 33,000 which show a close similarity to the molecular weights of seven of the eleven major polypeptides seen ha the present study (Fig. 1) . However, identification of the glycosylated polypeptides produced quite different results, MAcNAvo~rrox et al. (16) reporting the molecular weights of the glycosylated polypeptides as 130,000, 105,000, 82,000 and 74,000 compared to our estimates of 107,000, 86,000--91,000, 54,000 and 27,000--31,000. BI~GHA~ (4) reported glycopolypeptides of 180,000, t30,000, 83,000, 37,000 and 14,000. As all three studies h~ve used staining with Schiff's reagent to detect glyeosylation which does not always produce particularly strong staining it may well be that definitive identification of the glycosylated polypeptides awaits the use of radioisotopes.",

All the strains tested of the Massachusetts serotype: Beaudette, M41, the vaecinal strains H 120 and H52, the British field strains 927, 563 and 381, and the serologieally distinct SE 17 strain had glycopolypeptides of molecular weight 31,000 and 86,000. Connecticut and T had major glyeopolypeptides of molecular weight 27,000 and 91,000 while strains Iowa 97 and Holte had 27,000 and 89,000 molecular weight glyeopolypeptides. Apart from the finding that all viruses of serotype 1 had similar major glyeopolypeptides there was no relationship between the glycopolypeptide groups and any of the properties listed in Table 1 .",

Arch. Virol. 61, 341--345 (1979)] which was kindly supplied by Dr. B. LoM~ICZI, Veterinary Medical Research Institute of t, he Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary. In this paper the authors describe six major polypeptides of IBV with molecular weights: 75,000, 50,000, 45,000, 35,000, 28,000 or 24,000 and 22,000 which would appear to correspond to polypeptides p75, p54, p47, p40, p31 or p27 and p20--p23 of the present study. NAGY and LoiviNiCZi further report that the strains of IBV they examined could be divided into two groups consisting of those viruses with a 28,000 molecular weight polypeptide: M41, Beaudette, PV, Lerida (all of Massachusetts seretype) and SE 17, and those with a 24,000 molecular weight polypeptide : Connecticut (three strains tested), Gray, Iowa 97, Iowa 609 and T.",
