The Hni mice, when compared to their Lm mice counterparts, were susceptible to MHV3 infection showing higher virus titres in the liver and peritoneal exudate, comparable IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma titres in the peritoneal exudate or in the serum, and higher levels of PCA of PEC and SC. A higher virus titre was detected in the supernatants of H m mouse macrophages infected with MHV3. The activation of Hm mouse macrophages with LPS, IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma, in contrast to that of L m mouse macrophages, did not induce an antiviral effect with partial restriction of the MHV3 replication. The LPS antiviral activity was shown to be partially exerted by IFN alpha/ beta synthesis. The IFN gamma was shown to be more effective in inducing an antiviral state in Lm macrophages, when compared to IFN alpha/beta. The data obtained are consistent with the notion that the resistance mechanisms to the MHV3 infection involve the PCA and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN.",

Genetic homogeneous A/J mice have been reported to be resistant to MHV3 infection because R.C. Vassgo et al. they develop only a mild disease which disappears 4 to 6 days later.

The same group of genes regulates the antibody response to many complex immunogens unrelated with those used during the selective breeding, the antibody response being, as far it has been studied, a consequence of a diversity of immune functions, mainly the regulatory role of the macrophage [2, 3, 11, 22, 23, 26] .",

However, at the same conditions, no anti-MHV3 effect could be induced in macrophages from H.~ mice. Macrophages from Lm mice were shown to be more sensitive to IFN gamma than to IFN alpha/beta.

This study was undertaken in an attempt to investigate the resistance or susceptibility of genetic heterogeneous mouse populations to our strain of MHV3. The Hll I and Lnt lines of mice obtained by several selective breeding based on antibody responsiveness to an unrelated antigen [22] , are representative of a natural state of a mouse population concerning genetical and immunological aspects, since inbreeding was avoided during the entire selective process. Furthermore, we have observed a reconstitution of the normal distribution of the original F0 genetically heterogeneous population among an F2 segregant population [2, 3, 11] .

On the other hand, and acting synergistically, the higher PCA in susceptible mice, which demonstrates prothrombin cleaving activity [6] , was shown to induce abnormalities of the microcirculation, such as granular blood flow and sinusoidal microthrombi, that may disturb the virus clearence and precedes the higher viral replication in susceptible animals [6, 7] , which are unable to restrict the virus replication by an impaired macrophage activity. As a consequence, focal avascular lesions appear and progress to confluent necrosis (data not shown) that results in mortality.",

The same reasoning could be applied to the LPS, which exert its function partially through the IFN alpha/beta synthesis (Table 5 ).",

The synthesis of IFN gamma and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN gamma, and 2. The PCA levels exhibited by peritoneal exudate and spleen cells.",
