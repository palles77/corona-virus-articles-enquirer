            "text": "primarily in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. 1 In Sierra Leone alone, there were reports of more than 14 100 Ebola cases, resulting in over 3900 deaths, and more than 30 000 individuals were quarantined due to possible Ebola exposure. 2 Little is known about the epidemic's effects on the mental health of the general population in the affected countries. Numerous studies have examined the mental health effects associated with other infectious disease outbreaks including the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] and 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] The mental health impact of other emergencies, such as bioterrorism, have also been documented among survivors. 23 Psychological distress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been recorded among populations exposed to mass conflict and displacement 24 including those affected by the civil conflict in Sierra Leone between 1992 and 2002. 25 26 Known risk factors for anxiety, depression and PTSDincluding experience with ill individuals, perceptions of threat, high levels of mortality, food and resource insecurity, stigma and discrimination, and intolerance of uncertainty-may have been experienced by people in Sierra Leone during the Ebola epidemic. Adverse mental health outcomes could be expected in the general population given the magnitude of the epidemic. 15 27 High levels of distress have been documented among Ebola survivors in Guinea and Sierra Leone 28 29 and healthcare workers (HCWs) in all three affected countries. 29 30 There are few mental health resources in Sierra Leone; for example, when the Ebola outbreak began, there was only one trained psychiatrist for the population of over 7 million. Assessments of mental health and of risk factors for mental illness can support policy efforts to improve resources to address mental health and inform how resources can be targeted most efficiently-especially in the aftermath of a devastating Ebola epidemic.",

Participants responded using 4-point Likert Scale items ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). Responses were further dichotomised into 'agree' and 'disagree,' and the scores reversed so that higher scores represented more perceived risk. We also created a composite score across all four domains with 1 representing 'any perceived Ebola threat' and 0 representing 'no perceived Ebola threat. ' Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). 31 PHQ-4 was developed by combining two ultrabrief screeners, the PHQ-2 and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale, that have been demonstrated to reliably measure depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants were asked to report their symptoms of depression and anxiety in the past 2 weeks on a Likert Scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) for a maximum score of 12. The sample was further dichotomised into those who expressed any symptoms compared with those who did not by creating a new composite variable. We also examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression using the established clinical cut-off total score of 6, which represents the proportion of people who would be considered as having clinical BMJ Global Health levels of depression or anxiety if the screener were used for diagnostic purposes. 32 Symptoms of PTSD were measured by the Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6), 33 which is a validated, shortened version of the full IES-revised (IES-r). 34 35 The full scale contains 22 items (scored from 0 to 88) with demonstrated reliability and validity to measure PTSD symptoms across different cultures and settings. While IES-r is generally not used to diagnose PTSD in clinical settings, it is widely used for screening at-risk patients with PTSD. The IES-6 includes a total of six items-two items from each of the three subscales of the measure, namely intrusion, hyperarousal and avoidance. 33 Participants were asked to report their PTSD symptoms in the past 7 days on a Likert Scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). We dichotomised the sample into those who expressed any symptoms versus those who did not by creating a new composite variable. We evaluated respondents for whom PTSD may be a 'clinical concern' using an inputted 1.09 mean item cut-off score (equivalent to 24/88 on IES-r). 36 In addition, we assessed respondents who met 'probable diagnosis' of PTSD using an inputted 1.5 mean item cut-off score (equivalent to 33/88 total score in IES-r). 37 data collection In June 2015, FOCUS 1000 recruited 75 experienced data collectors, 25 team supervisors and 4 regional supervisors. They were trained for a week on overall assessment protocols and guidelines, informed consent, safety and security precautions, administration of questionnaire, and quality control and assurance. The training included oral translation of each item into local languages (Krio, Mende, Temne and Limba), back translations (orally), group discussions of the translations for accuracy in meaning, role plays to reflect possible range of responses, and group consensus on the final translations to ensure consistent and accurate use of each item. In July 2015, the trained data collectors used Open Data Kit for digital data collection at the household level. Nearly all interviews (>90%) were conducted in Krio.",

Most respondents reported between one and four symptoms. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, we found that persons with any level of Ebola experience were more likely to report symptoms of anxiety-depression and PTSD. Even though expression of one or more symptoms was widespread among our sample, a lower proportion of respondents met the clinical cut-off scores for anxiety-depression (5%-7%) and probable diagnosis for PTSD (15%-17%). The proportion of respondents who exhibited clinical level symptoms of anxiety-depression may be considered 'lower than expected' given the magnitude and duration of the epidemic, but may also point to a culture of resiliency among Sierra Leoneans. 40 On the other hand, we documented substantial PTSD, which is a public health concern that may require targeted mental health interventions at the individual level and community level for those with some personal Ebola experience. A national assessment of the mental health impact of the 2003 SARS epidemic in Taiwan, using a different scale than in our current study, found 4% prevalence of depression after the epidemic ended. 3 Another population-based survey in Taiwan revealed 12% prevalence of psychiatric morbidity following SARS. 9 In Singapore, a community-based sample detected that a quarter of all respondents had clinical levels of PTSD symptoms. 11 Other mental health assessments with SARS survivors 4 8 and HCWs 5 documented similar or higher clinical PTSD levels compared with our current assessment. One study found that HCWs with a history of mental illness before SARS were more likely to report new onset following the epidemic. 7 In our assessment, we cannot determine how past mental health history of PTSD in Sierra Leone, especially due to the prolonged civil war from 1992 to 2002, may have influenced the levels of clinical PTSD concern we detected.",

            "text": "In a systematic review, adverse mental health impact has been documented among conflict-affected persons. 24 In Sierra Leone, during protracted civil conflict, exposure to traumatic events was associated with non-specific physical ailments. 46 High prevalence of traumatic experiences and psychiatric sequelae has also been documented among Sierra Leonean refugees. 25 Among war affected youth in Sierra Leone, social disorder and perceived stigma contributed to both externalising and internalising problems. 47 Former child soldiers in Sierra Leone saw reliable improvement in PTSD symptoms over time, suggesting that a supportive environment may encourage resilience. 48 A key recommendation in previous studies and WHO guidance is to integrate mental health into primary healthcare services. 49 One study found global return on investments for scaling up treatment for depression and anxiety. 50 An example of such effort is in progress in Sierra Leone wherein public health nurses are trained to screen patients for possible mental health needs. 51 The WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme emphasises that scaling up mental health services is a joint responsibility that requires collaboration from governments, health professionals, donors, civil society, communities and families. 52 limitations Although a random national sample was obtained, our sample is not necessarily nationally representative. The sample had a higher proportion of respondents with any education compared with the general population. 53 However, we did not find any association between education level and mental health symptoms, suggesting that this may not have influenced our findings. We acknowledge the necessity of validating survey instruments before using them in a new cultural context. Although PHQ-4 and IES-r have been widely used globally, 31-37 54 neither has been validated nor used in Sierra Leone prior to this study. We therefore do not know the validity of clinical cut-off scores for our sample. To the best of our knowledge, PHQ-4 and IES-r (or the shortened form in this assessment) have not been used to measure population-level symptoms of mental health in any similar setting; making it impossible to compare our results to similar populations elsewhere. However, we found both had acceptable internal reliability and factorial validity. In the current survey, the PHQ-4 instrument demonstrated acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.78) and good factorial validity (GFI=0.999, CFI=0.999, RMSEA=0\u00b7030). The shortened IES-6 scale used in the present study demonstrated acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1=0.78) and good factorial validity (GFI=0\u00b7998, CFI=0\u00b7998, RMSEA=0.023). In addition, the national sample was not designed to produce specific estimates for directly affected persons such as Ebola survivors, families of Ebola victims and quarantined persons. Moreover, there are no baseline/historical data available for comparisons. We also did not measure the effects of exposure to Sierra Leone's civil conflict on long-term PTSD outcomes on the population prior to Ebola.",

Use of brief mental health screeners during outbreak response could increase the ability to identify and address the needs of high-risk groups. We have demonstrated the ability to rapidly administer PHQ-4 and IES-6 at a population-level to identify factors associated with mental health symptomology towards the end of an unprecedented infectious disease epidemic. Preventing, detecting and responding to mental health conditions should be an important component of global health security efforts. 55 56 ",
