            "text": "Abstract. Regulated secretory proteins are thought to be sorted in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) via selective aggregation . The factors responsible for this aggregation are unknown . We show here that two widespread regulated secretory proteins, chromogranin B and secretogranin II (granins), remain in an aggregated state when TGN vesicles from neuroendocrine cells (PC12) are permeabilized at pH 6.4 in 1-10 mM calcium, conditions believed to exist in this compartment. Permeabilization of immature secretory granules under these conditions allowed the recovery of electron dense cores. The granin aggregates in the TGN largely ex-HE mechanism by which constitutive and regulated secretory proteins are sorted in the trans-Golgi network (TGN)' is poorly understood (for review see iB urgess and Kelly, 1987) . It has been postulated that a key step in this sorting process is the selective aggregation of regulated, but not constitutive, secretory proteins in the TGN (Kelly, 1985; Burgess and Kelly, 1987; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Huttner et al ., 1988; Gerdes et al., 1989; Huttner and Tooze, 1989; Tooze et al., 1989) . This hypothesis is largely based on morphological data showing that regulated secretory proteins form electron-dense cores in the TGN (for review see Farquhar and Palade, 1981; Orci et al., 1987; Tooze et al ., 1987) . Aggregation of a protein inevitably segregates it from proteins that do not aggregate but remain in solution in the fluid phase that is excluded from the aggregate. Thus, if aggregation is a key step in the sorting of secretory proteins, the crucial questions arising are: (a) why does aggregation occur specifically in the TGN ; and (b) why is the aggregation selective for regulated secretory proteins?",

The low pH, high calcium milieu was sufficient to induce granin aggregation in the RER. In the TGN of pituitary GH4C cells, the proportion of granins conserved as aggregates was higher upon hormonal treatment known to increase secretory granule formation . Our data suggest that a decrease in pH and an increase in calcium are sufficient to trigger the selective aggregation of the granins in the TGN, segregating them from constitutive secretory proteins .",

Concerning the first point, both constitutive and regulated secretory proteins are believed to move from the RER to the TGN by bulk flow (for review see Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . In bulk flow, an increase in the concentration of secretory proteins in a distal compartment as compared to a proximal compartment can only occur as the result of the selective removal of molecules, e.g., the recycling of soluble ER-resident proteins or the net movement of water across the membrane into the cytoplasm . in the concentration of regulated secretory proteins in the trans-Golgi compared to the RER have been reported (Bendayan et al., 1980; Salpeter and Farquhar, 1981; Bendayan, 1984; Posthuma et al., 1988) .

One parameter of the lumenal milieu that is known to differ between the RER and the TGN is the pH; the TGN has been shown to be moderately acidic . From the data available (see Anderson and Orci, 1988, and refs. therein) , the TGN lu-menalpH can be estimated to be -1 U above that ofneuroendocrine secretory granules (pH 5.2-5.5; Poisnet andTrifaro, 1982; Johnson, 1987) , i.e., around pH 6.4, a value consis-tent with previous considerations (Griffiths and Simons, 1986) . Another parameter is the concentration of calcium ions. Studies in various regulated secretory cells (Stoeckel et al., 1975; Ravazzola, 1976; Mata et al., 1987; Roos, 1988) have shown that the calcium concentration in the Golgi complex is significantly higher (N2 .5-fold) than in the RER which is believed to contain 3 mM calcium (Sambrook : 1990) , and two-thirds of that found in secretory granules, which havebeen shown to contain 20-50 mM calcium (Poisner and Trifaro, 1982; Bulenda and Gratzl, 1985) . These observations suggest that the lumenal milieu of the TGN differs from that of the more proximal compartments of the secretory pathway in that it contains a higher concentration of calcium ions (probably around 10 mM total calcium ; see Discussion for \"free\" vs. \"bound\" calcium) . The selective aggregation ofregulated, but not constitutive, secretory proteins in the TGN may therefore reflect the inherent property of the former, but not the latter, proteins to come out of solution upon a change in certain parameters of the lumenal milieu such as pH and calcium ion concentration.",

            "text": "The complexity of regulated secretory proteins makes it likely that certain specific features of the sorting mechanism may vary depending onthe regulated secretory protein under study. We have been focusing on the granins (chromogranins/secretogranins) as model proteins to study sorting (Huttner et al., 1991) because they are found in secretory granules ofmost endocrine cells and neurons (Ross et al., 1985 ; Wiedenmann and Hutmer, 1989) . Hence results regarding their sorting in one cell type can be generalized to most endocrine and neuronal cells . The granins are a family ofat least three proteins (chromogranin A, chromogranin B [CgB], and secretogranin II [SgH]) . The deduced primary structure of the granins (Benedum et al., 1986; Iacangelo et al., 1986; Benedum et al., 1987; Gerdes et al., 1989) predicts an abundance of acidic residues and a secondary structure alternating between helix and turns. These features are consistent with their aggregation at low pH in the presence of calcium ions. In vitro studies have shown that granins bind calcium (Reiffen and Gratzl, 1986; Cozzi and Zanini, 1988) andthat these proteins, but not various constitutive secretory proteins, aggregate in the presence of millimolar calcium ions at acidic pH (Gerdes et al., 1989; Gorr et al., 1989; Yoo and Albanesi, 1990) . However, these studies were performed with granins isolated from secretory granules and were carried out at a pH corresponding to that of neuroendocrine secretory granules rather than that of the TGN . Hence, the relevance of these studies for the aggregation of the granins occurring in the TGN remains to be established. We therefore investigated in the present study whether a low pH-, high calcium milieu corresponding to that believed to exist in the lumen of the TGN is sufficient to (a) induce and maintain the aggregation of the granins in the secretory pathway, and (b) segregate these proteins from bulk flow markers and resident proteins.",

Control and hormone-treated cells were photographed at the same exposure and negatives were printed under identical conditions . EM Based on previous work CTooze et al., 1991) , a fraction enriched in immature secretary granules was prepared from PC12 cells as follows . A postnuclear supernatant was prepared from PC12 cells as described (Tboze and Huttner, 1990 ) except that the cells were homogenized in 0.25 M sucrose containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4 . The postnuclear supernatant (1-ml aliquots) was subjected to differential centrifugation at 4\u00b0C . First, most (>95%) of TGN membranes, mitochondria, and mature secretory granules were pelleted by centrifugation for 35 min at 10,000 rpm . This and all subsequent centrifugations were carried out using polycarbonate tubes and a TLS-55 rotor in a Beckman TT-100 ultracentrifuge with the brake off. The supernatants were subjected to a second centrifugation for 22 min at 25,000 rpm to sediment immature secretary granules. The pellets were resuspended in 50#1 of 0.25 M sucrose and mixed with either 50 pl of 0.25 M sucrose (control) or with 50 Al of 0.25 M sucrose containing 1 mg/ml saponin and two times concentrated nonaggregative or aggregative milieu. After 5 min of incubation at 0\u00b0C, samples were either mixed with paraformaldehyde (1% final concentration, added from a 16% stock), fixed for 20 min at 0\u00b0C and centrifuged for 30 min at 55,000 rpm, or centrifuged without prior fixation. All pellets were then overlaid with 8 % paraformaldehyde and kept overnight at 4\u00b0C. Samples were then washed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and postfixed in cacodylate buffer containing 1% OsO4 and 1 .5 % magnesium ferrocyanide . After washes in cacodylate buffer and H2O, pellets were incubated for 30 min in 1.5 % magnesium uranyl acetate in water. They were then dehydrated in ethanol, incubated in propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon. Thin sections were contrasted with lead citrate and examined in a Philips 400 microscope.

These cells express high levels of CgB and SgII, sulfate these proteins in the TGN, and package them as dense-cored aggregates very efficiently into secretory granules (Lee and Huttner, 1983 ; Rosa et al ., 1985; Rosa et al ., 1989; Tooze and Huttner, 1990 ) . The following experimental approach, referred to as the \"standard procedure, was used to study the aggregation of the granins in the TGN. First, short (5 min) pulse labeling of cells with [35S]sulfate was used to label proteins selectively in the TGN (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987 ; Tooze and Huttner, 1990) , and TGN-derived vesicles were isolated from the pulse-labeled cells by differential and velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation . Second, the [35 S]sulfate-labeled TGN vesicles were permeabilized with saponin in various buffers to be able to expose the TGN lumen to a defined milieu . One buffer had a pH of 7.4 and contained no added calcium ions and is, based on the results described below, referred to as the \"nonaggregative milieu .\" The other buffer had a pH of 6.4 and contained 10 mM calcium ions, conditions believed to exist in the lumen of the TGN in vivo (Stoeckel et al., 1975 ; Ravazzola, 1976; Mata et al., 1987 ; Anderson and Orci, 1988 ; Roos, 1988 ; see Discussion for \"free\" vs . \"bound\" calcium) . This buffer is, based on the results obtained, referred to as the \"tiaggregative milieu .\" The release of the [35 S]sulfate-labeled granins from the permeabilized TGN vesicles, as revealed by their appearance in the supernatant upon centrifugation, reflects the absence, or reversal, of an aggregated state . Conversely, we interpret the The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 115, 1991 Figure 1 . Release of granins from the TGN of PC12 cells after permeabilization of the membrane with saponin in nonaggregative milieu . [35 S]sulfate-labeled TGN vesicles were obtained from PC12 cells according to the standard procedure, incubated in nonaggregative milieu in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 0.5 mg/ml saponin, centrifuged, and pellets (P) and supernatants (S) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by protein staining (right) and fluorography (left) .

When the granins obtained in the supernatant were incubated in aggregative milieu, they remained soluble, despite the presence of some TGN membranes (Fig.  2 B) . This indicated that aggregative milieu did not induce the aggregation of the granins after their release from the TGN, i.e., upon their dilution to a concentration at least 100fold lower than in the TGN lumen. This conclusion was supported by the observation that partially purified CgB and SgII remained soluble upon exposure to aggregative milieu at ti70 pg/ml (Fig. 2 C) , i.e., at a concentration at least two orders ofmagnitude below that in the TGN (estimated granin concentration >10 mg/ml) .",

Samples incubated in the absence of saponin were characterized by the presence of numerous (284/100 pmt) dense-cored structures (Fig. 3 , A-C) which had the typical morphological appearance of PC12 cell immature secretary granules (Tooze and Huttner, 1990) . Almost no (6/100 1mz) dense cores were found when membranes were permeabilized by saponin in nonaggregative milieu and fixed 5 min later (Fig. 3 , D-F). In contrast, after membrane permeabilization by saponin in aggregative milieu (Fig. 3, GI) , dense cores were observed at a frequency (197/100 ,um') that was -70% of that of the nonpermeabilized control. Interestingly, the dense cores recovered after saponin permeabilization in aggregative milieu appeared to be less electron-dense than those ofthe nonpermeabilized control. This may suggest that molecules other than the granins, which may not be retained in the aggregates aftermembrane permeabilization in aggregative milieu (e.g., ATP and catecholamines), contributed to the electron density of the cores. In conclusion, the recovery of dense cores after membrane permeabilization in aggregative, but not nonaggregative, milieu indicates that these are the morphological correlate of the granin aggregates observed biochemically under the former condition .",

            "text": "If aggregation of regulated secretary proteins is a sorting event, constitutively released proteins should be excluded from the aggregates. If, in the case of the granins, a rise in calcium and a decrease in pH are the parameters that trigger their aggregation in thelumen ofthe TGN ofPC12 cells, constitutively secreted proteins present at the same time in the TGN should not undergo aggregation in the aggregative milieu . The only constitutive marker in PC12 cells which is sulfated and thus can be selectively labeled in the TGN is the hsPG (Tooze and Huttner, 1990) . Unfortunately, the hsPG was found to be membrane associated in the TGN since it was not solubilized when TGN vesicles obtained from PC12 cells pulse labeled for 5 min with [11S]sulfate were extracted with carbonate at pH 11.0 ( Fig. 4 A, left) . We therefore employed 4-methylumbelliferyl R-D-xyloside (xyloside) sulfatelabeled TGN vesicles were obtained from xyloside-treated PC12 cells according to the standard procedure, subjected to carbonate extraction at pH 11, centrifuged, and the pellets (P) and supernatants (S) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% (-xyloside) or 15% (+ xyloside) gels, followed by fluorography. The asterisks indicate a sulfated =120-kD membrane protein distinct from CgB which is largely masked by the hsPG in the absence of xyloside and which has an electrophoretic mobility similar to CgB on 15% gels . to induce the synthesis of free sulfated GAG chains as a bulk flow marker. Xyloside competes with the core proteins of proteoglycans as an acceptor for GAG chains (Lohmander and Hascall, 1979) , and xyloside-induced GAG chains have been found to be secreted largely via the constitutive pathway in AtT20 cells (Burgess and Kelly, 1984) . Three lines of evidence showed that xyloside-induced GAG chains are soluble in the TGN and can serve as a constitutively secreted bulk flow marker in PC12 cells . First, carbonate extraction at pH 11.0 of TGN vesicles, prepared from PC12 cells pretreated with 1 mM xyloside for 2 h and pulse labeled for 5 min with [a 5 S]sulfate, showed that the sulfated GAG chains, which had an M, between 5,000 and 20,000, were soluble ( Fig. 4 A, right) . Second, pulse-chase experiments with PC12 cells showed that the release of the sulfated GAG chains into the medium followed constitutive kinetics. When xyloside-treated PO2 cells pulse labeled for 5 min with [35 S]sulfate were chased at 37\u00b0C for 30 and 60 min, -63 and 88%, respectively, of the total [35S]sulfate-labeled GAG chains were released into the medium (Fig . 4 B) . The secretion of the GAG chains was inhibited at 20\u00b0C, as is the case for the hsPG ('Iboze and Hutmer, 1990) . When PC12 cells were pulse labeled at 20\u00b0C for 5 min with [\"S]sulfate and chased at 20\u00b0C, the secretion of the labeled GAG chains was completely inhibited over a 60min chase period (Fig . 4 B) . When the temperature was then raised to 37\u00b0C, -78% of the total [ 35 S]sulfate-labeled GAG chains were released into the medium during the following 30 min of chase . Xyloside treatment of PC12 cells did not affect the efficient sorting of the granins in these cells since neither CgB nor SgII were secreted during the chase at 37\u00b0C (data not shown) . Third, as shown in Fig. 4 (Tooze and Huttner, 1990) . This was consistent with the observation that the sulfation of GAG chains is a turns-Golgi-specific event (Kimura et al ., 1984) .",

We attempted to investigate this issue using saponin permeabilization of RER-derived vesicles prepared from PC12 cells pulse labeled for 5 min with ['H]tyrosine. However, for unknown reasons, the newly synthesized granins, in contrast to ER-resident proteins (see Fig . 5 ), were not released from saponin-permeabilized RER vesicles in nonaggregative milieu (data not shown) . Hence, instead of permeabilizing RER vesicles with saponin, we used Triton X-100 to investigate the effect of nonaggregative and aggregative milieu on newly synthesized granins. When RER vesicles, obtained from [3H]tyrosine-pulse-labeled PC12 cells after velocity gradient centrifugation, were incubated in 1 % Triton X-100 in nonaggregative milieu, two proteins of M 100,000 and M 85,000, corresponding to newly synthesized CgB and SgII, respectively, were recovered in the supernatant, whereas they were found in the pellet after incubation in aggregative milieu ( Fig . 6 A, right) . As in the case of TGN vesicles (see Fig. 1 A) , this behavior of the granins was quite specific since protein staining of the corresponding gel ( Fig . 6 A, left) showed that no other protein exhibited such a dramatic alteration in its distribution between pellet and supernatant in aggregative milieu as compared to nonaggregative milieu .",

These cells, like the related GH3B6 cell line, express prolactin and growth hormone (Tashjian, 1979) as well as CgB and SgII (Tougard et al., 1989; Scammell et al., 1990) . GH4C1 cells grown in the absence ofadded hormones contain a low number of secretory granules . Treatment of GH4C1 cells with a combination of EGF, estradiol, and insulin markedly increases the level of prolactin (Kiino and Dannies, 1982) , CgB and SgII (Scammell et al., 1990) , as well as that of secretory granules (Scammell et al., 1986) . As revealed by pulse labeling with r35 S]methionine ( Fig. 8 A, crease in SgII concentration in this compartment . Immunofluorescence of control and hormone-treated GH4Cl cells for SgII showed that, qualitatively, all ofthe cells were immunoreactive in both conditions, the immunostaining being observed in a perinuclear, Golgi-like pattern as well as in small punctate structures which were dispersed in the cytoplasm and close to the plasma membrane, and presumably were secretory granules ( Fig. 8 A, leftand right) . Quantitatively, however, hormone-treated cells showed an increase in SgII immunoreactivity, which was observed not only with respect to the secretory granule staining but, consistent with the increase in SgII synthesis, also in the Golgi area. This allowed us to use GH4C1 cells not only to extend our study on the aggregation of the granins in the TGN to other neuroendocrine cells, but also to investigate the possible role of protein concentration in this phenomenon. (Since prolactin is not sulfated in GH4C1 cells [data not shown], we could not include this protein in our analysis .) Hormone-treated GH4C1 cellswere pulse labeled for 4 min with FS]sulfate, and [uS]sulfate-labeled TGN vesicles were incubated with Triton X-100 in nonaggregative or aggregative milieu, as described above for PC12 cells. SgII, which was the major FS]sulfate-labeled band in these cells (data not shown), was found in the supernatant after incubation in nonaggregative milieu but was almost completely recovered in the pellet after incubation in aggregative milieu ( Fig. 8 B , bottom) .

SgII Only the region of the fluorogram containing the SgIl band is shown. Bar, 10 Am . (Farquhar and Palade, 1981; Orci et al., 1987; Tooze et al., 1987) . In the present study, we have developed a system in which biochemical parameters involved in this aggregation process could be investigated . By using [31S]sulfate to label the granins selectively in the TGN, and by permeabilizing TGN vesicles prepared from such cells with saponin, we could specify the milieu in the lumen of the TGN and thus identify parameters of the milieu that are involved in the aggregation process. We found that a decrease in pH and an increase in the concentration of calcium ions, two parameters that we believe are relevant for granin aggregation in the TGN in vivo, prevented the release of the granins from saponin-permeabilized TGN vesicles. The lack of release was not due to low pH and high calcium interfering with the membrane permeabilization since other lumenal proteins and GAG chains were released under these conditions. Further evidence for the permeabilization ofthe TGN membrane comes from the observation (not shown) that in the absence of leupeptin there was substantial and sometimes complete proteolysis ofthe granins, which most likely was caused by lysosomal proteases that had access to the granins after saponin permeabilization of membranes. Several lines of evidence indicate that the lack ofsolubility of the granins after permeabilization of the TGN membrane in the low pH-, high calcium milieu reflected the conservation of the granin aggregates known to exist in this compartment (Tooze and Huttner, 1990) . First, no pelleting of the granins was observed when these proteins were first allowed to diffuse from permeabilized TGN vesicles in nonaggregative milieu and then exposed to aggregative milieu, or when a partially purified preparation of these proteins was incubated in aggregative milieu . These observations make it unlikely that after permeabilization of the TGN vesicles in aggregative milieu, the granins diffused from the lumen of the TGN and then formed aggregates which sedimented independently of the TGN vesicles. Second, EM on immature secretory granules indicated that membrane permeabilization in aggregative milieu allowed the recovery of densecored structures which appeared similar to the bona fide dense cores of the starting material. Consistent with this observation, when the membrane of mature secretory granules was permeabilized in aggregative milieu, the granins remained in an aggregated state although these proteins are readily solubilized after exocytosis which releases them into a neutral pH-, low calcium milieu .",

When the membrane of the RER was solubilized in aggregative rather than nonaggregative milieu, the granins were found in the pellet . This induction of granin aggregation is what would be expected if a change in the milieu is the cause of aggregation in vivo as secretory proteins travel along the secretory pathway, and if the aggregative milieu used in this study mimicked the lumenal milieu in the TGN . The aggregation ofthe granins probably occurred simultaneously with the solubilization of the RER membrane, i.e., when they were present at a relatively high concentration (presumably Chanat and Huttner Aggregation-mediating Sorting of Secretory Proteins several mg/ml) since no aggregation was observed when these proteins were exposed to aggregative milieu at much lower concentration, after their diffusion from the TGN lumen or after their partial purification . It therefore appears that these proteins must be present at a certain concentration for the aggregative milieu to be effective . This conclusion is consistent with previous morphological observations in vivo andwith results obtained on the aggregation ofthe granins in vitro (Gory et al., 1989) . A role ofprotein concentration in the aggregation process is further supported by our finding that after hormone treatment ofGH4C1 cells, which was found to increase granin synthesis and their concentration in the TGN, a greater proportion of SgII in the TGN was recovered in an aggregated state than for control cells.",

This raises the possibility that the change in one ofthese parameters is sufficient to trigger granin aggregation in the TGN in vivo, provided that the other parameter is at an \"aggregative\" value. We found that at a free calcium ion concentration above 1 mM, a change in pH from neutrality to pH 6.4 was sufficient to recovery SgII in an aggregated state. Translated to the in vivo situation this may mean that calcium, which is thought to enter the secretory pathway at least to some extent at the level of the ER (for review see Meldolesi et al., 1990) , binds to the granins already in this compartment but does not promote their aggregation until they reach the slightly acidic environment of the TGN . If this is the case, the increase in the level of calcium in the trans-Golgi area as compared to the ER (Stoeckel et al., 1975; Ravazzola, 1976; Mata et al., 1987; Roos, 1988) would be the consequence of the aggregation of secretory calcium binding proteins. Alternatively, the higher level of calcium in the trans-Golgi than in the ER may reflect the existence, at least in regulated secretory cells, ofa calcium uptake system in the TGN which causes the calcium ion concentration to raise above 1 mM, and thereby facilitates granin aggregation in this compartment . The presence ofa Cal+ATPase in the Golgi complex of neurons (Mata and Fink, 1989 ) is consistent with this possibility. At any rate, if the aggregation is a crucial step in the sorting of the granins, the requirement of a slightly acidic pH for this process to occur would, alone, be sufficient to explain the missorting of these proteins in the presence of weak bases in vivo (Gerdes et al ., 1989) .",

For example, in bovine somatomammo-trophs, the granins are packaged largely into one population of secretory granules whereas prolactin and growth hormone are largely segregated into two other secretory granule populations (Hashimoto et al., 1987; Bassetti et al., 1990) . If the aggregation of prolactin, growth hormone, and the granins would be differentially sensitive to the reduction in pH and the increase in calcium, various aggregates containing preferentially one or the other of these regulated secretory proteins would form in the TGN, giving rise to multiple subpopulations of secretory granules in the same cell. This speculation is consistent with the observation that after removal of the secretory granule membrane with non-ionic detergent at pH 6.2 in the absence of calcium, prolactin remains aggregated (Giannattasio et al., 1975) . Another striking case of differential aggregation has been reported for Aplysia, in which the two parts of the egg laying hormone precursor generated by proteolysis form separate aggregates in the TGN which are packaged into distinct secretory granules of the same cell (Fisher et al., 1988; Sossin et al., 1990) .",
