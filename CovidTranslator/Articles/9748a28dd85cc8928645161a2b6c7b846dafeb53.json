To investigate if PDCoV is also present in Taiwan, three swine coronaviruses-PDCoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV)-were tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in 172 rectal swab samples from piglets exhibiting diarrhea between January 2016 and May 2017 on 68 pig farms in Taiwan. The rRT-PCR results were positive for PDCoV (29/172, 16.9%), PEDV (36/172, 20.9%), TGEV (2/172, 1.2%), and coinfections (16/172, 9.3%). After cloning and sequencing, PDCoV nucleocapsid genes were analyzed. Phylogeny results indicated that the nucleotide sequences of all isolates were like those reported in other countries. To further trace PDCoV in the period of 2011 to 2015, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect antibodies against PDCoV. The results showed that 279 of 1,039 (26.9%) sera were positive for the PDCoV nucleocapsid protein, implying that PDCoV might have existed in Taiwan before 2011.",

PDCoV was first discovered in Hong Kong, China in 2012 [1] . It was subsequently reported in the United States [2] [3] [4] and South Korea [5] in 2014, followed by Thailand and mainland China in 2015 [6, 7] . Currently, there are at least three members of the family Coronaviridae that can cause diarrhea in pigs: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) [8] . Both TGEV and PEDV belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus, whereas PDCoV belongs to the new genus Deltacoronavirus. PEDV is an important enteric pathogen that causes piglet diarrhea worldwide, and it has caused significant economic losses in the swine industry in Taiwan from 2013 to 2014 [9] . However, PDCoV and PEDV share a similar clinical manifestation, and many studies have shown that coinfection with PEDV and PDCoV is common in piglets [2] [3] [4] . Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the viruses responsible for causing diarrhea in piglets and to specifically investigate the prevalence of PDCoV infection in Taiwan.",

After electrophoresis and gel elution, amplified products were cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence data were analyzed using Chromas Lite, and the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames were compared to other PDCoV sequences using BLAST. The sequences of three complete PDCoV nucleocapsid (PDCoV-N) genes, Taiwan 22, Taiwan 33, and Taiwan 36, were obtained and deposited in GenBank (accession numbers KY586147 to KY586149).

The PDCoV-N protein was then expressed by adding isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (final concentration 0.3 mM) to a bacterial culture and was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography for a subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 1,039 serum samples collected from 34 pig farms in Taiwan during 2011 to 2015 were tested, and 27 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pig sera were obtained from the Animal Technology Institute Taiwan to be used negative controls. The ELISA was conducted following the modified procedures described in a previous study [11] . In brief, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with purified His-tagged PDCoV-N (100 ng/well) in 50 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 \u00b0C for 12-14 hours and blocked with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS): 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing three times with TBST (TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20), 100 \u03bcl of the tested sera (1:100 dilution in blocking buffer) were added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, the plate was washed three times with 200 \u03bcl of TBST and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with 100 \u03bcl of goat \u03b1-porcine Ig antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a concentration of 1:4000 dilution in blocking buffer. After washing, 100 \u03bcl of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution was added, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The development reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcl of 2 M H 2 SO 4 , and the absorbance at 450 nm wavelength was measured. All tests included a blank coated with antigen only, a second antibody control, and six SPF sera as negative controls. If the detection value was lower than (mean neg + 2\u00d7 SD), the serum was considered negative. On the other hand, a serum detection value larger than [(mean neg + SD) \u00d7 2] was considered positive.",

All 29 PDCoV-positive samples were re-examined by conventional RT-PCR, which showed that only eight (8/29, 27.6%) were positive, accounting for 4.7% (8/172) of total tested samples. The relatively low positive rate determined by conventional RT-PCR was comparable to that determined by a similar method in a recent study, in which PDCoV was detected exclusively in nursing piglets, with an overall prevalence of approximate 1.28% (5/390) in southern China [12] . It is plausible that for the specimens containing PDCoV genomic RNA of low quantity or quality, most of the commercial rRT-PCR kits, which are designed to amplify short target sequences, can achieve higher sensitivity in detection compared with conventional RT-PCR. In addition, four of the eight positive samples were cloned and sequenced, and the sequence data matched the PDCoV-N reference sequences. All of these four sequences covered the complete coding sequences of PDCoV-N, but one of them, Taiwan 34, had a nonsense mutation within the PDCoV-N gene (data not shown). Such a mutation might arise from an occasional change in RNA sequence occurring during serial propagation of PDCoV [13] . Despite the mutation, the result revealed the presence of the PDCoV genome in the specimen in which Taiwan 34 was cloned, while it remained to be clarified if mutations occurred in other PDCoV-encoded genes as well.",

            "text": "Phylogeny analysis of PDCoV-N genes showed that PDCoVs found in Taiwan were highly similar in their nucleotide sequences to isolates from the United States, mainland China, and other countries (Fig. 1) . However, the aminoacid-based phylogeny results of the PDCoV-N proteins revealed that Taiwan isolates can be clustered into different groups (Fig. 2) . This might be due to missense mutations in the 66 th (F \u2192 Y), 198 th (E \u2192 K), 234 th (G \u2192 R/T), 271 th (F \u2192 S), and 275 th (G \u2192 E/D) amino acid residues of the PDCoV-N protein (Fig. 3) . The charges of amino acids were changed in three residues (198 th , 234 th , and 275 th ), and the remaining residue changes had altered polarity. The phylogeny results imply that PDCoVs isolated in Taiwan might have existed for a long time. To determine if PDCoV had already existed in Taiwan before 2016, the PDCoV-N protein was cloned, expressed, purified, and coated onto a 96-well microtiter plates for retrospective testing. Swine sera collected between 2011 and 2015 were tested for their reactivity to a PDCoV-N protein.",
