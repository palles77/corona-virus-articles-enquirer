SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a virus that causes severe lung damage, encodes an array of proteins able to inhibit induction and signaling of type-I interferons. However, recent studies have demonstrated that interferons are produced during SARS-CoV infection in humans and macaques. Furthermore, nuclear translocation of activated STAT1 and a range of interferon-stimulated genes could be demonstrated in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques. In line with these observations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells have been shown to produce interferons upon SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Given the pivotal role of interferons during viral infections, (differential) induction of interferons may affect the outcome of the infection. Therefore, the functional implication of interferon production during SARS-CoV infection remains to be re-investigated.",

Many of the people that were infected with SARS-CoV early during the epidemic had been in close contact with live animals on Chinese wet markets, suggesting that the virus came from an animal source [5] . The current hypothesis is that bats are the main natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV-like viruses, and virus transmission to humans most likely occurred via civet cats, which are common trade animals on these wet markets [6] .",

Approximately 20-30% of SARS patients suffered from severe disease and needed to be transferred to intensive care units. Ultimately, the overall fatality rate approached 10-20% in adults, while children seemed to be relatively resistant to SARS [11] . The clinical course of SARS follows three phases. The first phase is characterized by active viral replication and patients experience the first symptoms of disease, such as fever and malaise. Virus levels start to decrease while antibodies, which are effective in controlling infection, increase in the second phase. Nonetheless, pneumonia and immunopathological injury also develop in this phase. Eventually, in the third phase, fatal cases of SARS develop severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage [7] . Although a wide range of animal species are susceptible to experimental infection with SARS-CoV, nonhuman primates are the only animals in which pathology similar to that of human SARS patients has been observed so far. The lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques demonstrate type-II pneumocyte hyperplasia and multiple foci of acute diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by flooding of the alveoli with edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells [4] . Furthermore, these lungs demonstrate lesions that are quite similar to those observed in human SARS patients. While SARS does not seem to produce the severe illness in macaques that is seen in some, mainly elderly, human SARS patients, symptoms resemble those that are seen in children. Interestingly, more recent studies have demonstrated that aged macaques do show more severe disease than young macaques, which corroborates findings made in humans infected with SARS-CoV [Smits SL et al., Manuscript in Preparation].",

IFN-\u03b3, a single type-II interferon, is not secreted in direct response to viral infection but produced by activated T cells and natural killer cells. In principal, most mammalian cells are capable of producing type-I interferons, however, the mechanism and amount of interferons that are induced can differ among cell types. While fibroblasts, epithelial cells and neurons mainly secrete IFN-\u03b2 initially before they switch to IFN-\u03b1 production, plasma-cytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) initially make large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 followed by a switch to IFN-\u03b2.

The relevance of a specific route depends on the type of virus, type of cell that is infected and the stage of infection in that same cell. The two major pathways through which cells sense invading viruses are the intracellular pathway and the endosomal pathway. In the intracellular pathway, IFN-\u03b2 is induced when pathogenassociated molecular patterns, such as dsRNA and 5\u2032-triphosphorylated ssRNA, are sensed by the RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA-5, the main intracellular receptors of viral RNA [21] [22] [23] [24] . When viral RNA binds to these helicases, a signaling chain is induced, eventually leading to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF-3, a molecule that plays an essential role in the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [25] [26] . As soon as IRF-3 is phosphorylated, the molecule homodimerizes and is translocated to the nucleus where it recruits the cofactors CPB and p300 and binds the IFN-\u03b2 promoter in order to start IFN-\u03b2 gene transcription. Ongoing viral replication subsequently induces the activation of transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and AP-1, which both bind the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and further enhance IFN-\u03b2 gene expression [27] . The induction of interferon leads to the production of IRF-7, which is only present in low amounts in most cells. Phosphorylated IRF-7 subsequently binds the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, resulting in enhanced induction of IFN-\u03b2 and the induction of the IFN-\u03b1 genes through a positive feedback loop.",

This pathway is used by pDCs, which are also known as 'professional type-I interferon producers' [28] . pDCs predominantly sense viral RNA through the endosomal TLR7 and TLR8. When these TLRs become activated, the adapter molecule MyD88 is recruited, which in turn recruits IRAK-4 and IRAK-1. Subsequently, through activation of several signaling molecules, IRF-7, NF-\u03baB and IRF-3 are activated and translocated to the nucleus, leading to the production of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. Interestingly, pDC is the only known cell type that constitutively expresses high levels of IRF-7 and thus high levels of interferon can be produced by these cells [29] .",

These data suggest that SARS-CoV is able to inhibit the induction of interferons, either actively or passively. Several potential mechanisms through which SARS-CoV can inhibit interferon induction have been described recently. Double membrane vesicles are formed after CoV infection, and it is hypothesized that these complexes shield viral RNA from sensing molecules [34] . Another possibility is that one of the SARS-CoV viral proteins sequesters the genomic RNA in such a way that host-sensing proteins do not detect it as has been demonstrated for several other viruses, such as VP35 from Ebola and NS1 of influenza. It remains to be proven if SARS-CoV actively inhibits interferon production or just escapes from the induction of interferons. Spiegel and colleagues demonstrated that although SARS-CoV does not induce interferon, IRF-3 initially translocates to the nucleus of infected cells in SARS-CoV-infected cells [32] . However, at a later time point after infection, IRF-3 was again localized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, SARS-CoV interfered with IRF-3 hyperphosphorylation, dimerization and binding to cofactor chromatin-binding protein. Also, studies using expression plasmids that contain one of the SARS-CoV proteins have demonstrated that SARS-CoV proteins open reading frame (ORF)3b, ORF6 and the N proteins are able to inhibit interferon production by affecting the IRF-3 activation pathway [35] . More recently, other groups demonstrated that SARS-CoV does not activate IRF-3 and induce NF-\u03baB or interferon in infected cells, but that subsequent treatment with polyriboinosinic acid:polyribocytidylic acid or infection with Sendai virus still results in interferon production [36, 37] . In addition, when recombinant SARS-CoV, deleted for one of their accessory ORFs, was used to infect cells, none of the deletion mutants were able to induce interferon, and Sendai virus infection did induce IFN-\u03b2 production in these cells [37] . Apparently, SARS-CoV does not induce the interferon-sensing pathway, but also does not actively block sensing of other viral proteins or stimuli either.",

However, induction of type-I interferons, both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, can be observed in SARS-CoV-infected cynomolgus macaques early during infection, both at the gene expression and protein level [13] . In accordance with our macaque data, a recent study using material from 40 clinically well described SARS cases revealed high levels of type-I interferon in plasma and robust interferon stimulated gene expression in precrisis SARS patients [40] . These data demonstrate that, although SARS-CoV blocks interferon induction in vitro, type-I interferons are still produced during SARS-CoV infections in vivo.",

They found that, in contrast to earlier reports from studies performed in in vitro cell cultures, interferon induction is not inhibited in pDCs after SARS-CoV infection. While interferons cannot be detected in SARS-CoV-infected myeloid DCs, pDCs rapidly produce and secrete considerable amounts of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 upon SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, using mouse hepatitis virus as a CoV model, it was observed that rapid interferon induction in pDCs was dependent on TLR7 and MyD88 [41] . These sensing molecules induce expression of IFN\u03b1 upon viral infection through IRF-7, constitutively expressed in pDCs, suggesting that the pDC restricted TLR7/IRF-7 interferon induction pathway is not affected by the virus. It is still unclear whether DCs are infected by SARS-CoV, and so far no conclusive evidence on infection of DCs by SARS-CoV has been reported [42] [43] [44] [45] . On the other hand, active viral replication may not be necessary to mount an efficient interferon response. Castilletti and coworkers observed that SARS-CoV induces IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and that this interferon response was even more robust when PBMCs were incubated with (paraformaldehyde) fixed SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells [43] . In addition, Spiegel and coworkers found that both live and UV-inactivated SARS-CoV were able to induce type-I interferons in DC cultures [46] .",

For example, the ORF7a protein and nsp-1 were observed to inhibit cellular protein synthesis and promote host cell mRNA degradation, respectively [50, 51] . In addition, the SARS-CoV proteins ORF3b and ORF6 inhibit interferon signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway both passively and actively [35] . Inhibition of interferon signaling by ORF6 was described in detail by Frieman and coworkers [52] . They demonstrated that ORF6 tethers karyopherin \u03b12 and karyopherin \u03b21 to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi membrane, inhibiting the nuclear import of STAT1 and thus preventing transcription of the ISGs.",

            "text": "Despite a wealth of evidence that SARS-CoV blocks interferon signaling, we were able to visualize interferon signaling in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques by immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated STAT1 [13] . In line with the observations made with single SARS-CoV genes, activated STAT1 was not observed in SARS-CoVinfected cells, while the nuclei of surrounding cells displayed nuclear translocation of activated STAT1. The induction of interferons and the subsequent activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, resulting in transcription of several ISGs, is schematically represented in Figure 1 . Cynomolgus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV and subsequently euthanized either at day 1 or day 4 after infection, after which pieces of lung were sampled randomly from each macaque [13] . RNA was isolated from these lung pieces and used for microarrays, from which genomic data are incorporated in Figure 1 . Each gene-included pathway is illustrated with an individual heatmap, representing differential expression of that particular gene in a SARS-CoV-infected macaque compared with a mock-infected (phosphate-buffered saline) macaque. A red bar indicates that the particular gene is upregulated in SARS-CoV-infected macaques, as compared with mock-infected macaques, while a green bar indicates that the gene is downregulated. At day 1, represented by the upper bars in the heatmaps, an induction of several IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and IFN-\u03b2 was observed, leading to induced expression of numerous ISGs, such as PKR, MX molecules, OAS molecules and RIG-I, and cytokines such as IL-6 and CCL2. Furthermore, induced expression of IRF-7, part of the positive feedback loop for interferon production, as described earlier, was also observed. At day 4, represented by the middle bars, expression of these genes remained upregulated, except for some of the IFN-\u03b1 subtypes. In pieces of lung from the infected macaques where no viral RNA could be detected, the lower bars in the individual gene heatmaps, no expression of type-I interferons was observed but various ISGs were upregulated, suggesting paracrine stimulation. Overall, these data demonstrate that interferons are produced after SARS-CoV infection and are capable of activating neighboring cells.",

            "text": "The presence of type-I interferons and ISGs in SARS-CoV-infected humans and macaques raises the question to what extent these pathways play a role in SARS pathogenesis. Pretreatment of cells with interferon before infection prevents SARS-CoV replication in these cells [53] . Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 downregulates expression of ACE2, the cellular SARS-CoV receptor, on the cell surface, resulting in decreased infection in these cells [54] . In addition, Haagmans and coworkers showed that IFN-\u03b1 protects type-I pneumocytes from SARS-CoV infection in macaques [55] . In line with these observations, interferon treatment starting early after onset of clinical symptoms may also be effective in humans [56] . Especially in individuals that produce low levels of endogenous interferon, interferon therapy might be quite effective in preventing severe disease. Definitive evidence for a protective role of interferons in mice is lacking at this moment. Hogan and coworkers found that mice deficient for STAT1 showed slightly more pathological changes compared with wild-type mice, suggesting a role of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in the outcome of infection [57] . A limited role of STAT1 signaling in this model can be explained by the fact that no significant IFN-\u03b1 production has been reported in SARS-CoV mouse models thus far [58] . It remains to be investigated whether the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in different animal models is linked to varying amounts of IFN-\u03b1 produced.",

The reason for this difference is still unclear. However, it is hypothesized that SARS pathology is caused by an disproportional immune response, characterized by the induction of several inflammatory cytokines [11] . It has been shown that inflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 are produced at higher levels in elderly people as compared with the young, making them more vulnerable for the development of ARDS after SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, it could be envisaged that pDC numbers or their function decreases with age, leading to a less efficient interferon response at the time of infection or that pDCs become less productive at a higher age.",
