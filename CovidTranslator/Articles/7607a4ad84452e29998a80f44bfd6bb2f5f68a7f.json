To fight against COVID-19, we carried out research for the near native SARS-CoV-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM).",

Since the early December 2019, the outbreak of an unknown epidemic pneumonia in Wuhan, a city in Hubei Province of China, is identified to be caused by a novel coronavirus [5] , named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and the disease was named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by The World Health Organization (WHO) [6] . Up to now, nearly 80,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,800 deaths in China have been reported (from WHO website). Rapid increasing number of cases also has been reported by many other countries around the world. The globe is now facing a big threat of COVID-19 [7] .

S protein of coronavirus consisted of S1 and S2 subunits. When S1 subunit is disassociated, S2 undergoes a conformation change, extending itself from compressed form to a nail-like shape, termed as post-fusion state. The nail-like shape was also observed by other researchers [13] [14] [15] . Work done by Song et al. [15] gave a detailed structure analysis of S2 protein using recombinant protein. Not only they reported the morphology of S2 protein at post-fusion state, they also reconstructed a 3D map. The 2D average image ( Figure 2E ) and 3D map ( Figure 2D ) reported in their paper [15] , have a consistent result with our observation both in negative staining or Cryo-EM images (shown in Figure 2C and Figure 3E ,3F).",
