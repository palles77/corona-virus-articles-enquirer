History, physical examination findings, and routine clinical pathologic testing are seldom pathognomonic for an infectious cause, but they help the clinician rank differential diagnoses and develop a logical diagnostic plan. Historical findings can increase the degree of suspicion for infectious diseases. Exposure to other infected animals or contaminated fomites is important for agents with direct transmission, such as those inducing respiratory disease (e.g., feline herpesvirus 1, canine bordetellosis) or gastroenteritis (e.g., canine and feline giardiasis, canine and feline parvovirus infection). Potential exposure to vectors (e.g., mosquitoes for dirofilariasis; ticks for Lyme borreliosis [Ixodes spp.] , ehrlichiosis [Rhipicephalus sanguineus], Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF; Dermacentor spp.], babesiosis [R. sanguineus] ) or appropriate travel history (e.g., coccidioidomycosis in the Southwest; RMSF in the Southeast; blastomycosis in the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio River valleys) can also suggest an infectious disease. Vaccination history, deworming history, and determination of whether other animals or people in the environment are also affected can aid in ranking infectious diseases on a differential diagnoses list.",

B. burgdorferi vaccines induce antibodies that are detected by IFA and ELISA and one of the available point-of-care assays. * Western immunoblot can differentiate vaccineinduced antibodies from those from natural infection (Jacobsen, Chang, and Shin, 1996) . A point-of-care kit \u2020 commercially available for detection of B. burgdorferi antibodies against the C6 peptide, E. canis antibodies, and Dirofilaria immitis antigen was licensed recently. Antibodies against the C6 peptide are not induced by vaccination, so positive results of this kit denote exposure to B. burgdorferi. Some nonpathogenic strains of B. burgdorferi induce antibody production but not clinical disease (Breitschwerdt, 1995) . Some dogs with acute Lyme disease are seronegative on initial testing; documentation of an increasing antibody titer can suggest recent exposure. Antibody titers greater than or equal to 1:1000 have been detected in clinically normal dogs. Healthy dogs develop the same antibody responses as clinically ill dogs, however. Because of these factors, interpretation of serum antibody titers is difficult. Serum antibodies against B. burgdorferi only documents exposure to B. burgdorferi (or a similar antigen), not clinical disease. Finding a higher titer in CSF than in serum occurs in some dogs with suspected neurologic disease secondary to Lyme disease.",

Some dogs with B. gibsoni are seronegative on IFA using B. canis antigen; IFAs are available using B. gibsoni antigens. Dogs suspected of having babesiosis yet seronegative for B. canis should be screened for antibodies against B. gibsoni. Antibodies can be detected in dogs that are healthy and those that are clinically ill. Antibody titer magnitude does not correlate to the presence or absence of disease. A titer of greater than 1:320 was suggested for B gibsoni, but not all infected dogs achieve this titer magnitude (Birkenheuer et al, 1999) . It is important to determine which species are involved in a case because response to treatment varies. Duration of positive titers after resolution of disease is unknown. In untreated experimentally infected dogs, titers remain high for at least 6 months. Untreated, seropositive dogs should be considered carriers of the infection. Treatment is indicated only for seropositive, clinically ill dogs.",

Concurrent measurement of serum antibody concentrations can be helpful; if CSF concentrations are greater than serum concentrations, the antibody in CSF had to be produced locally and suggests CNS distemper. Detection of serum IgG antibodies is of minimal diagnostic value because a positive titer could develop secondary to vaccination or previous exposure. A fourfold increase in serum IgG titer over a 3-to 4-week period suggests recent infection. Detection of circulating IgM antibodies is consistent with recent infection but not clinical disease.

A presumptive diagnosis of distemper encephalitis can be made with increased CSF protein and leukocytes (lymphocytes predominating) plus a positive CSF antibody titer in a sample not contaminated with peripheral blood. Definitive diagnosis of canine distemper infection requires demonstration of viral inclusions by cytologic examination (see Color Plates 2D and 2E), direct fluorescent antibody staining of cytologic or histopathologic specimens, histopathologic evaluation, or PCR documentation of distemper viral DNA in peripheral blood, CSF, or conjunctival scrapings. (See Appendix I for availability of PCR testing.) Viral inclusions can rarely be found in erythrocytes, leukocytes, and leukocyte precursors of infected dogs.

Definitive diagnosis of FIP requires histopathologic evaluation of tissues. Lesions visible by light microscopy are generally pathognomonic, but immunohistochemistry can be used to confirm coronavirus particles. PCR can also detect coronavirus particles in effusions, tissues, and blood (Barr, 1996) . Detecting coronavirus by PCR in effusions and tissues predicts FIP, but detection in blood does not. Hyperproteinemia and polyclonal gammopathy (detected by electrophoresis; see Chapter 12) can occur, particularly in the noneffusive form. Monoclonal gammopathy rarely occurs. Classic nonseptic pyogranulomatous exudate or modified transudate with high protein and relatively low cell count (see Chapter 10) is commonly used for presumptive diagnosis. Electrophoresis can also be performed on body fluids.

            "text": "FeLV infection has six stages (Zenger and Wolf, 1992) . Stages 1 through 3 are dissemination stages; bone marrow infection occurs in stage 4. Infected neutrophils and platelets are released from the bone marrow in stage 5, and virus appears in systemic epithelial tissues (including salivary glands and tear glands) during stage 6. ELISA can detect p27 antigen in serum during stages 2 through 6; p27 in cells is not detected by the IFA until stages 5 and 6. Thus serum ELISA is the first assay to become positive after infection, positive results occurring 2 to 30 weeks (generally 2 to 8 weeks) after infection. Seropositivity can be detected by serum ELISA before a cat develops persistent (i.e., stages 4 to 6) infection; thus, some cats yield negative results after development of neutralizing antibodies. In healthy cats, seropositive results by serum ELISA should be confirmed by IFA or retesting by ELISA in 4 to 6 weeks. Some ELISA-positive cats reverting to negative status have become latently infected. The majority of latently infected cats are ELISAnegative on all testing, but virus can be isolated from bone marrow. Virus can also be localized to other tissues. False-positive ELISA results can be the result of poor laboratory technique.",

In dogs, D. immitis antigen tests may be positive as early as 5 to 6 months and are usually positive 6 to 7 months after infection. False-negative results usually occur in early stages of infection and may occur in single-sex infections (male only) or in animals with low worm burdens (< 3 to 5 worms). Retesting in 2 to 3 months should be performed to detect dogs in which results were negative in early stages of infection. After successful adulticide treatment, test results become negative in approximately 12 weeks. In experimental infections, cats testing positive did so about 8 months after infection. However, single sex or low worm burden infections can lead to false-negative results. Therefore a positive antigen test result is specific for infection, but a negative result does not rule out dirofilariasis. In cats, the combination of serum antigen test results with serum antibody test results is more sensitive than performing either test alone (Synder et al, 2000) .",
