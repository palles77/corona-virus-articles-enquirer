The assay is evaluated as a diagnostic test for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). It is based on a well-documented key event in the development of FIP: the replication of virulent FCoV mutants in monocytes/macrophages. To detect most feline coronavirus field strains, the test was designed to amplify subgenomic mRNA of the highly conserved M gene. The test was applied to 1075 feline blood samples (424 from healthy, 651 from sick cats suspected of FIP) and returned 46% of the diseased cats as positive for feline coronavirus mRNA in their peripheral blood cells; of the healthy cats, 5% tested positive. Of a group of 81 animals in which FIP had been confirmed by post-mortem examination, 75 (93%) tested positive, whereas 17 cats with different pathologies (non-FIP cases) all tested negative. In view of the low rate of false-positive results (high specificity) the mRNA RT-PCR may be a valuable addition to the diagnostic arsenal for FIP.",

They are ubiquitous in cat populations, with particularly high prevalence in catteries and multiple-cat households. Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) show a bimodal pathogenicity distribution, with subclinical or mild enteric infections in young kittens at one extreme and the deadly feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) at the other. The low virulence strains are referred to as feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV), the highly virulent ones as FIP viruses (FIPV) . Though occurring only sporadically (i.e. not causing epidemics), FIP is an important disease: it is mostly fatal, its biology is still poorly understood and prevention is difficult, to say the least. FIP is an immune mediated, progressive polyserositis and pyogranulomatosis. It occurs worldwide, affecting both domestic and wild felids (Holzworth, 1973; Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979) .",

Not unexpectedly, however, FCoV were detected in blood samples of healthy cats that never developed FIP, and also after experimental FCoV infection (Gamble et al., 1997; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Herrewegh et al., 1995; Kipar et al., 1999) .",

This stretch of 60-98 nucleotides (coronavirus species dependent) has been derived from the 5 -end of the genome through discontinuous transcription and is not translated. Making use of primers specific for the M-gene mRNA leader sequence (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997 ) and a conserved part of the M-gene, a molecule of 295 bp will be amplified. Using the mRNA RT-PCR assay, type II FCoV genomes like FIPV 79-1146, FIPV Wellcome, FIPV NOR15 and FECV 79-1783 could be detected in cell culture. Type I FCoVs like FIPV UCD1, FIPV UCD3, FECV UCD, and FIPV Dahlberg were detected as well. In view of the fact that also canine (CCV K378) and porcine (TGEV Purdue) coronaviruses tested positive the assay should detect most, if not all, FCoV variants. The high detection rate of FCoV from cats suspected of suffering from FIP in the field supports this assumption. From its design, the mRNA assay would appear to be more specific (only replicating virus detected) and more sensitive (only nucleated blood cells employed) for the diagnosis of FIP than previous RT-PCR assays focused on genomic RNA in body fluids, feces, and tissues (Gamble et al., 1997; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Herrewegh et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "Using this assay, we detected mRNA in about 93% of EDTA blood samples from confirmed FIP cases. In the genomic RNA PCR, 78-92% of FIP cats were found to test positive (Gamble et al., 1997; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Herrewegh et al., 1995) . More importantly, of the healthy cats living in catteries or multiple cat households with a notoriously large virus burden, only 5% tested positive for FCoV. The presence of FCoV RNA in blood monocytes in healthy cats infected with FCoV is an indication that the development of FIP is not associated with the capability of an FCoV to cause viraemia and systemic infection (Meli et al., 2004) Previous studies quote figures between 20 and 40% (Gamble et al., 1997; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Herrewegh et al., 1995) , which can be expected in view of the high sensitivity of the PCR. The specificity of our test format would therefore appear as a significant improvement over previously published methods. The question remains if the mRNA positive, healthy cats harbour virulent mutants in an early stage of FIP pathogenesis. Quantitative analyses of FCoV mRNA levels would be needed to identify potential differences between healthy and diseased cats.",
