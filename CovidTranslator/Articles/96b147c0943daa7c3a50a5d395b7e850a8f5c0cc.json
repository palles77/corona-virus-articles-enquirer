There is great similarity in the clinical presentations of the VHFs, making them nearly impossible to differentiate without sophisticated and time-consuming laboratory analysis 6. VHFs that respond to antiviral therapy need to be treated immediately, but clinically cannot be separated from the viral pathogens that lack specific therapy 7. Limited prophylactic and therapeutic options [14] 8. Isolation and identification of VHF agents frequently require a biosafety 4 level laboratory 9. Life-saving supportive therapy often requires an intensive care bed, which is impractical in a mass casualty situation Fortunately, few VHFs (CCHF, Lassa fever, Andes viruses, Ebola virus, and Marburg virus) exhibit secondary human-to-human spread especially in the nosocomial setting [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

First known as Korean hemorrhagic fever, now it is commonly referred to as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) [36] . Apodemus agrarius (the field mouse) was found to be the reservoir. The virus, first isolated in 1978, was designated the Hantaan virus after the Hantaan River (Korea) where many of the original cases were described. Rattus norvegicus and R rattus were the hosts of Seoul virus, the cause of urban HFRS [5, 36] . In Scandinavia, nephropathia epidemica, a renal disease with mild or without hemorrhagic manifestations, was caused by Puumala virus spread from Clethrionomys glareolus, the bank vole. The only insectivore to harbor a hantavirus is the Suncus murinus, the Indian tree shrew. Prospect Hill virus was the first hantavirus causing human disease to be described in the Americas (Microtus pennsylvanicus [meadow vole] host). Severe HFRS of the Balkans was caused by Dobrava virus associated with Apodemus flavicollis. At least three subfamilies and 28 species of hantaviruses cause either HFRS or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) [5, 36, 48] .",

In at-risk areas, the disease is spread (horizontally) by scratching, biting, or infected aerosols among the rodents. The virus spreads to all organs but particularly concentrates in the kidneys and lungs, with high rates of replication in the salivary glands. Virus is shed in urine, feces, and saliva, peaking 2 to 10 weeks after infection, and continuing for life, although in reduced quantity with rising antibody titers. There is no cell death observed in the infected animal-hosts. Seroprevalence studies in endemic areas have found R norvegicus to be the most frequently infected species (Kinmen study: R norvegicus, 50%; Mus musculus, 20%; R flavipectus, 2%) [57] .",

Isolate the patient and institute and strictly enforce infection control measures (strict isolation, negative pressure rooms). Intensive care is likely to be required. Adequate numbers of isolation beds where an ''intensive'' level of care may be delivered should be preplanned [86, 87] .

On-going monitoring must be instituted for all at-risk contacts. A selfmonitoring system is preferred because it is less labor-and resource-intensive [83] . 7. Aggressively manage the patient with supportive therapy. 8 . Provide specific antiviral therapy where available. Begin ribavirin pending the identification of the etiologic agent. Continue treatment if an arenavirus or a bunyavirus is identified. Discontinue therapy if flavivirus or filovirus or other viruses that do not respond to ribavirin are identified [14] . 9. There is no licensed vaccine except for Yellow fever. Ribavirin prophylaxis is controversial because it may only delay the onset of disease [14] .",

Another recommended intravenous regimen is an initial dose of 30 mg/kg followed by 15 mg/kg every 6 hours for 4 days, followed by 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours for 6 days. Oral ribavirin doses are, 2 g loading dose followed by 4 g/d in four divided doses for 4 days followed by 2 g/d for six doses. Oral ribavirin is believed to be only half as effective as intravenous therapy. Intravenous ribavirin, if given within 6 days of the beginning of symptoms, reduces mortality by 90% [89] . Postexposure prophylaxis with ribavirin is recommended by some but not all authorities. This consists of 2 g orally in four divided doses for 7 days [14, 16, 17, 78, 84, 95] .

Further investigation found two additional cases in 1994, both in butchers and both organisms recovered from wounds [166] . Sources of infection identified in the original cases included contaminated wounds (butchers, six); tick bites (student and engineer, two); and consumption of raw camel milk (soldier, driver, and poultry worker, three) [166] . The investigation identified 37 patients (20 laboratory confirmed). All presented with an acute febrile flu-like illness and hepatitis; half displayed hemorrhagic findings (55%); and 20% had encephalitis. It was concluded that the disease was transmitted by mosquito bite or direct contact with infected sheep, goats, and rodents. How the virus is maintained in nature is under investigation.

Aggressive international profiling and tracking of individuals who acquire or seek to acquire specialized viral laboratory equipment, viral cultures, viral hosts or vectors, and visit viral habitats, or have contact with their natural victims, needs to be undertaken. Such programs deter all but the most determined, resourceful, and elaborately sponsored malefactors. Denying resources to a determined and well-financed enemy protected by a foreign government and its international boundaries is difficult if not impossible. Only intelligence agencies' clandestine targeting of state and ''stateless'' organizations is able to address threats from the remainder.",
