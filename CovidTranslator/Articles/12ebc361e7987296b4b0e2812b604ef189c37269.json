            "text": "RNA of two neurotropic variants of the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) independently isolated from the brain and spinal cord of an infected Wistar Furth rat were compared with that of the parental virus. The mRNAs corresponding to the genes encoding the peplomer (S) and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins of the variant viruses were found to be smaller in size. The possible sequence changes were studied by oligonucleotide fingerprinting and direct RNA sequencing. Both variants have a large deletion of 246 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal end of the HE protein. However, this truncated protein was not detected in the infected cells, suggesting either a translational regulation or rapid degradation of the truncated protein in these cells. The variant virus isolated from the spinal cord has a second deletion of 147 amino acids in the amino-terminal half of the S protein. This deletion site corresponds to a hypervariable region where deletions have been frequently noted among MHV variants with different biological properties. These findings suggest that the changes in pathogenic properties of the two neural isolates are associated with drastic alterations of the viral structural glycoproteins. o 1991 Academic PWSS, hc.",

In view of the interesting pathogenic properties of the JHM virus, extensive studies have been undertaken to understand the genetic basis for MHV-induced neurological diseases. Studies on monoclonal antibody-resistant MHV variants and on variants isolated from persistent infections have shown that mutations in the peplomer protein S are associated with marked variations in disease patterns of these virus isolates, suggesting that this structural gly-883 0042.6822/91 $3.00 CopyrIght 0 1991 by Academic Press, Inc.

The At1 If cord variant differs from the parental JHM virus in its pathogenic properties in that it induces a chronic demyelinating disease in Wistar Furth rats when inoculated intracerebrally, independently of their age.

In contrast, the At1 If brain isolate produced an acute encephalitis when inoculated into 2and lo-day-old Wistar Furth rats. Both the brain and the spinal cord isolates displayed a different pattern of virus-specific mRNAs from the parental JHM virus in the infected cells (26). However, the brain isolate did not replicate as well as the At1 If cord variant in the G26-24 cell line and did not form syncytia (26).

This photograph is a composite of different time exposures of the same gel. a JHM strain maintained in laboratories in Japan (17, 29). As shown in Fig. 1 , all the virus strains examined synthesized seven to eight mRNA species in varying quantity. The size of several of these mRNAs appeared different; most notably, the mRNA 3 of the At1 lf cord isolate was smaller than those of the parental JHM strain and of the brain isolate but similar to that of JHM (2), which has a deletion of 423 nucleotides in the S gene (28). In addition, the sizes of mRNA 2 and mRNA 2-1 of both neural isolates were smaller than those of the corresponding mRNA synthesized by the JHM(2) strain; the parental JHM virus synthesizes only negligible quantity of mRNA 2-l (see below). As expected from the nested-set structure of MHV mRNAs, the mRNA 2 of the parental JHM strain is larger than that of JHM(2) because of the presence of the deletion in gene 3 of JHM(2) (28). The amounts of mRNA 2 in both neural isolates were low; however, a longer exposure clearly showed that mRNA 2 of both neural isolates was smaller than that of the parental JHM strain (data not shown). This result suggests that there are internal deletions in genes 2-1, 3, and possibly also gene 2 of the neural JHM variants. However, these size differences could also be due to aberrant transcrip- tional initiation. Furthermore, because MHV mRNAs have a nested-set structure, the genetic alterations affecting the size of mRNA 2 could be the result of deletions or insertions in the coding sequences of mRNAs 2-1 or 3.",

The oligonucleotide map showed that the cord isolate lacked oligonucleotide spots numbered 4, 9, and 19 , which have previously been mapped contiguously to the middle portion of this gene (27) (data not shown). This result suggests that the smaller size of mRNA 3 of At1 If cord isolate is most likely caused by a deletion in the coding sequence of gene 3. The site of the deletion was determined by direct sequencing (28) of the purified genomic RNA of both the parental JHM virus and the variant viruses. After identifying the approximate site of the deletion by preliminary sequencing, the region from nucleotides 842 to 1830 of gene 3 was completely sequenced. Figure 2 shows that, when compared with the sequence of the parental JHM, gene 3 of the variant virus has a deletion of 441 bases extending from nucleotide 1324 to 1765. The reading frame downstream of the deletion remains unaltered. The rest of the gene 3 sequence is identical with that of the parental virus. Therefore, the smaller size of mRNA 3 of the At1 1 f cord variant is the consequence of a deletion within the coding sequence of gene 3. The loss of 441 nucleotides from base 1324 to 1765 of the gene 3 sequence results in a smaller peplomer protein lacking an internal 147 amino acids.",

When compared with JHM(2), which makes a large quantity of mRNA 2-l (5) both the brain and spinal cord isolates appeared to have a smaller mRNA 2-l (Fig. 1) . However, because of the nested-set structure of MHV mRNAs, it could not be determined with certainty whether the coding region of gene 2-l had any deletion, since the size comparison of mRNA 2-l was complicated by the size differences in mRNA 3 between these viruses. We therefore performed PCR amplification of the gene 2-l of the parental JHM and the two variant viruses, using two specific primers corresponding to both ends of the gene. The results showed that the gene 2-l of the parental JHM has exactly the same size as that of the published JHM-2 ( is homologous to nucleotides 781-801 of gene 2 located 36 nucleotides upstream from the intergenic site of gene 2-l (5). After an initial denaturation at 94\" for 2 min, 20 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Seigakaku) were added and the samples were incubated at 45\" for 30 min. The cDNA products were then amplified by addition of 2.5 units of Taql DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer-Cetus, Norwalk, CT). Each cycle of amplification consisted of a 1.5.min denaturation at 94\", followed by 2-min annealing at 58\", and 3-min extension at 72\". After 35 cycles, the final product was extended for 10 min. 20-~1 aliquots of the PCR reaction were electrophoresed on a 1.4% agarose gel. trast, the PCR-amplified gene 2-1 of both variants are smaller than that of the parental JHM, suggesting that the gene 2-l of these two variants has a deletion. The sites of the deletion were determined by DNA sequencing of the PCR products and also direct RNA sequencing of the genomic RNAs. The results showed that both variants contain a deletion of 739 nucleotides extending from nucleotide 555 to 1294 of gene 2-1, which translates into a deletion of 246 amino acids in the gene 2-l of both viruses (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, because the reading frame was changed after the deletion, the ORF of this gene in both variant viruses has a capacity to encode a protein of only 182 amino acids. This truncated protein product would be expected to lack the carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain.",

This result is consistent with the presence of a deletion in the S gene of the At1 If cord virus. Figure 5A also shows that the JHM parental virus produced a small amount of HE protein, which has the same size as that produced by the JHM(2)virus, indicating that the mRNA 2-l of the parental JHM virus does not contain a deletion. In contrast, neither of the two neural variants produced this protein. The reason for the failure to detect the HE protein in the variant viruses is not yet clear. This could be due to rapid degradation of the truncated proteins or the failure to initiate translation. We have also examined whether a truncated protein immunoprecipitable with anti-HE antibodies could be detected in purified virions or infected cell media since the truncated protein is expected to lack a C-terminal transmembrane domain; no protein was detected (data not shown). All of the viruses examined synthesized a 30-kDa polypeptide, which was precipitated by an antiserum prepared against the TrpE-MHV fusion protein containing 1 18 amino acids of the predicted gene 2 product (Fig. 5B) .
