            "text": "Influenza virus is an enveloped virus with segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (1) . Among the three species of influenza viruses A, B and C, human infections are most commonly caused by type A viruses (IAV), and result in a mild febrile illness to death (2) . The genome of IAV encodes eleven proteins, eight of which are packaged into progeny virions, with hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) expressed on the surface of virions as envelope glycoproteins. While NA facilitates progeny virion release, HA is responsible for virus entry (3) (4) (5) and other functions (6) (7) (8) . Binding of the spike glycoprotein HA to sialic acid moieties on the host plasma membrane triggers the uptake of the virion into an endosome (4) . The endosome is trafficked towards the nucleus and acidified as it matures (9) . At ~5-6 pH, HA undergoes an irreversible conformational change to mediate the fusion of the viral envelope and endosomal membrane, thus releasing the ribonucleoprotein core into the host cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, the core dissociates and the newly freed viral genome is actively imported into the nucleus, where replication of progeny genomes and transcription of mRNAs take place (10) . Viral mRNAs are then exported from the nucleus for translation. Transmembrane proteins such as HA and NA are synthesized on rough endoplasmic reticulum, delivered to the plasma membrane via an exocytic pathway, and targeted to cholesterol-rich lipid raft microdomains where progeny virions are assembled and released (11) . Accumulation of HA at the membrane triggers the nuclear export of progeny genomes to the membrane, mediated through the host cytoskeleton and Rab11-positive recycling endosomes (12) (13) (14) . Although poorly understood, the process of budding and release is thought to begin with deformation of the host membrane, possibly due to HA-induced membrane curvature (15) , interaction of the matrix M1 protein with progeny genomes (16, 17) , and M2-mediated scission to separate a fully formed viral envelope (18) . Recent studies also showed that IAV usurps host autophagy process to extracellularly release progeny viruses by directing autophagosomes to plasma membrane (19) . Here, the proton channel matrix protein M2 plays a key role in directing autophagosomes to the plasma membrane, through directly interacting with the autophagy protein LC3 (20) or its proton pump activity (21) . However, involvement of other autophagy processing factors in IAV exocytosis still remains to be examined.",

            "text": "Cathepsin B (CTSB) is a lysosomal cysteine protease primarily involved in the degradation of lysosomal proteins. In addition to its roles in protein turnover, CTSB plays key roles in the lifecycle of several viruses including Ebola virus (22) , Nipah virus (23), Moloney murine leukemia virus (24) and feline coronavirus (25) . CTSB catalytically activates viral membrane glycoproteins, which leads to viral release from endosomes to the cytoplasm through fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane (26, 27) . Unenveloped reovirus uses CTSB for the proteolytic disassembly of the viral capsid while in host endosomes (28) . Adeno-associated virus types 2 and 8 use CTSB to cleave capsid proteins, thereby priming rapid capsid disassembly in the nucleus (29) . The catalytic activity of CTSB is also involved in the optimal replication of Herpes simplex virus type I DNA (30) . We also showed that CTSB is involved in the trafficking of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane (31) and efficient release of HIV virions from macrophages (32) . Deficiency in functional CTSB retains tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and HIV virions in in the recycling endosomes and intracellular multivesicular bodies. Here, we further examined the role of CTSB in IAV infection using CTSB-deficient (CTSB \u2212/\u2212 ) bone marrow-derived immortalized macrophages (BMDIM) and CA-074Me in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. We found that CTSB plays a key role in optimal production of progeny IAVs.",

ActD is a transcriptional inhibitor that has been used extensively in influenza research to block viral replication by preventing nuclear import of the viral genome (41, 42) . Therefore, cells treated with ActD contain only the genetic material and viral proteins endocytosed from the original inoculum, affording an accurate means of assessing viral endocytosis in the absence of replication products. The extents of viral entry and replication were determined by real-time RT-qPCR on two viral genes: the hemagglutinin (HA) specific to the PR8 strain of IAV and the matrix (MA) gene highly conserved among IAV subtypes (37) . RT-qPCR has proven to be a useful tool in quantifying influenza particles (43, 44) . This is due in part to its sensitivity and the genetic nature of the virus, which packages one copy of each viral gene per virion. Thus, calculations of copy number accurately reflect the absolute number of virions present. As shown in Fig. 2A , RNA copy numbers of HA (left panel) and MA (right panel) were similar between wild-type and CTSB \u2212/\u2212 cells treated with ActD. Both copy numbers of HA and MA were ~2-fold higher in cells without ActD treatments, indicating production of new viral RNAs. ActD did not influence the viability of these cells (Data not shown). Since CTSB was not involved in either viral entry or RNA synthesis. We examined whether HA protein expression was defected in CTSB \u2212/\u2212 cells. To this end, cell lysates of IAV-infected wild-type and CTSB \u2212/\u2212 cells in the presence or absence of ActD were subjected to Western blot analysis for viral HA protein. Densitometric analysis of the immunereacted bands was performed and the intensities were normalized to those of \u03b2-actin. As shown in Fig. 2B , the amount of HA protein detected was significantly lower (~50%) in CTSB \u2212/\u2212 cells than that of wild-type cells. Similar results were also obtained in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages prepared from wild-type and CTSB\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2C) .",

These cells more closely approximate the respiratory epithelium which is infected in vivo, and as such are commonly used in influenza research. Consistent with data obtained from CTSB \u2212/\u2212 BMDIM, CA-074Me (up to 150 \u03bcM) had no effects on viral RNA copy numbers of HA and MA in IAV-PR8-infected A549 cells in the absence or presence of ActD (Fig. 3A) . However, Western blots against HA protein showed significantly decreased band intensities (~25%) in cells treated with 150 \u03bcM of CA-074Me, compared to those in non-treated cells (Fig. 3B ). Since no HA bands were detected in cells treated with ActD, HA proteins shown in Western blots likely represent newly synthesized HA proteins (Fig. 3C) . Treatments of CA-074Me had no effects on the viability of A549 cells (Data not shown).",

Since CTSB has been shown to have a role in trafficking functions (31, 32, 46) , it is possible that its inhibition may disrupt the transport of HA, subsequently targeting cargo for destruction in lysosomes (47) . Thus, we examined whether HA proteins were prevented from being transported to plasma membrane or redirected to lysosomal degradation, which may result in a defect in the infection of adjacent cells and an overall decrease in HA protein production by CA-074Me. To this end, A549 cells were infected in the presence or absence of CA-074Me and/or ActD, and HA proteins were visualized through confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In nontreated cells, IAV-PR8 infection (MOI of 10) yielded an even staining pattern for HA (green) in the plasma membrane of many cells (Fig. 4A, left panel) . Treatment with either CA-074Me (150 \u03bcM) or ActD (5 \u03bcg/mL) abolished the staining pattern, and instead only aggregated puncta at the surface of cells were visible in a limited number of cells (right panels). Since no HA was detected in cells treated with ActD through Western blots (Fig.  3C) , the aggregated puncta detected in CA-074Me-or ActD-treated cells could be viruses inoculated. To eliminate signals from inoculated viruses and to quantify production of HApositive vesicles, A549 cells were infected with IAV-PR8 at an MOI of 1 and cells were permeabilized before immunostaining. As shown in Fig. 4B , non-treated cells showed distinct punta, whereas CA-074Me-or ActD-treated cells showed no aggregated puncta and significantly less intracellular staining for HA relative to untreated cells; ActD-treated cells showed almost no intracellular staining (Fig. 4B, middle and right panels; Fig. 4C ).",

In most cases, the role of CTSB is to proteolytically activate viral proteins which facilitate escape into the cytoplasm following endocytosis. Given that IAV uses endosomes to enter host cells and transport viral genome to nucleus, we examined the role of CTSB in the early stages of the viral lifecycle. However, no significant differences between wild-type and CTSB \u2212/\u2212 BMDIMs, and between CA-074Me-treated and non-treated A549 cells were detected in viral entry and subsequent replication (Fig. 2B & 2A) . These data indicate that CTSB played no apparent role in the early lifecycle of IAV-PR8. As expected, cells treated with ActD had lower copy numbers of both HA and MA RNAs than untreated in BMDIM and A549 cells. However, there was a notable difference in the titres achieved in these cells in terms of both entry and replication.",

The large amount of viral RNAs in BMDIM could be due to the phagocytic nature of the cell and the propensity of influenza virus to generate defective particles in culture (45, 50, 51) . Conversely, in the absence of ActD, A549 cells produced about 5-fold more viral RNAs than BMDIM (~7 x 10 7 versus ~3 x 10 8 ).

HA proteins are also abundantly expressed in infected cells (45) and easily detected by Western blot or cytometry analysis. Therefore, HA expression was examined as a marker for viral protein production. Approximately 2.5 h post-infection, the background of host proteins is dramatically reduced as the cellular machinery is usurped for the production of viral proteins. Most viral proteins including HA are detected in 3 h post infection, which is stable up to 10 h (54) . Unlike the case for the entry and replication, CTSB \u2212/\u2212 BMDIM or CA-074Me-treated A549 cells contained significantly less amounts of HA protein than wild-type or non-treated cells, respectively, when measured 6 h post-infection ( Fig. 2B-C & 3B) . Also, HA proteins were not detected in infected cells in the presence of ActD (Fig. 3C) , suggesting that immunoreactive HA bands detected newly synthesized viral proteins.

            "text": "Nonetheless, it is clear that CTSB was required for optimal production of HA proteins, and genetic defects in or chemical inhibition of CTSB expression resulted in impairments of the surface presentation of HA protein and progeny virion production (Fig. 1 ) . To measure progeny virus production we used the hemagglutination assay which measures viral titres on the basis of HA protein on the surface of particles. Progeny virions acquire HA and other envelope glycoproteins passively by budding from infected host cells which bear these proteins on their membranes (56) . Absence of HA in the host membrane could have several deleterious consequences, considering HA is critical for endocytosis (5) and endosomal escape (57) , and export and packaging of progeny genomes (7, 8) . Thus, if progeny lacking HA are released from infected cells, it is likely that they will possess defects related to one or more of the above functions.",

            "text": "Resistance of circulating IAV strains to older antivirals such as amantadine as well as newer antivirals such as oseltamivir has increased at an alarming rate over the past decade (58) . Given the rate with which antiviral therapies are becoming obsolete due to viral mutations, a more effective strategy would be to target host rather than viral components required for the effective replication of IAV. Previously, IAV was shown to elevate CTSB activity and expression that facilitates antigen processing in dendritic cells murine cells (59) . Here, we also showed that deficiency in CTSB lead to defects in IAV virion production, suggesting that targeting CTSB could be a novel therapeutic strategy for IAV infection. Wild-type and CTSB \u2212/\u2212 BMDIM were infected with influenza A PR8 for 6 h at an MOI of 1 in the presence or absence of actinomycin D (ActD; 5 \u03bcg/mL). Cells were then harvested and total RNA extracts were used for RT-qPCR analysis for hemagglutinin (HA; PR8-specific) and matrix protein (MA; pan-specific). Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM from at least three independent experiments (N.S. = not significant). B-C. Similarly, BMDIM (B) and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (C) were infected, harvested, lysed and subjected to Western blotting for the influenza HA protein. B. A representative Western blot for HA protein and \u03b2-actin (as a loading control) is presented (top panel). Densitometric analysis of the bads was performed and results are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM (n = 3; bottom panel). C. A representative Western blot for HA protein and \u03b2-actin from two separate experiments is presented. A. A549 cells pretreated with different concentrations of CA-074Me for 30 min were infected with influenza A virus strain PR8 for 6 h at an MOI of 1 in the presence or absence of actinomycin D (ActD; 5 \u03bcg/mL). Cells were then harvested and total RNA extracts were used for RT-qPCR analysis against hemagglutinin (upper panel) and matrix (lower panel) RNAs. Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM from at least three independent experiments. Columns accompanied by the same letter are not significantly different from each other (Tukey's post hoc test, p < 0.05). B. Similarly, A549 cells treated with CA-074Me at doses indicated were infected, harvested, lysed and subjected to Western blotting for the influenza HA protein, and the resulting blots were used for densitometric analysis. A representative Western blot for HA protein and \u03b2-actin (as loading control) is presented (upper panel). Data are expressed as means \u00b1 SEM from at least three independent experiments (lower panel). C. A Western blot for HA protein in A549 cells treated with CA-074-Me (150 \u03bcM) or ActD (5 \u03bcg/mL) is presented.",

Cell culture supernatant of the last 6 h of infection were collected and subjected to a standard hemagglutination assay using chicken red blood cells and a series of two-fold dilutions of the supernatants. After 30 min incubation, wells were scored as being either positive or negative for agglutination, and the titer expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution yielding agglutination. The titre of CTSB \u2212/\u2212 BMDIM was significantly less than that of wild-type cells (p > 0.05; n=4). (B) Wild-type and CTSB \u2212/\u2212 BMDIM (1.0 x10 6 ) were infected with IAV-PR8 (MOI of 1) with or without CA-074Me (50 \u03bcM) for 1 h as described in Methods. After 6 h of infection, surface expression of HA protein was analyzed using flow cytometry. Data shown are representative results of similar observations in more than two independent experiments.",

About 6 h post-infection, cellular compartments were labelled for late endosomes/lysosome (Lysotracker Red\u00ae), HA (green) and nucleus (Hoechst 33342; blue), as described in Methods.

Images shown are representative images from three independent experiments. C. The numbers of puncta per cell in random fields of view were quantified and plotted for each treatment group.
