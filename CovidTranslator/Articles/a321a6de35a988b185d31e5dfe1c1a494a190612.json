            "text": "A chronic colitis which ulcerates is a common, almost universal finding in the 11 species and hybrids of the 1584 Callitrichidae we have necropsied and studied histologically since 1966. In Table 1 the number of necropsies we have done are tabulated by calendar year by species. The variable numbers reflect largely population changes in species that have comprised the marmoset research colony over the years. For example, up until 1979, Saguinus fuscicoIlis illigeri and related subspecies (the socalled white-lipped tamarins) were the most numerous animals under study; they have been outnumbered by Saguinus oedipus oedipus (the cotton-top tamarin) only since 1975, when the S. f. subspecies were purposely reduced in numbers to permit an increase in the number of cotton-tops available for study. The table also shows the colony census of live animals by species on April 1, 1984 , and the total numbers of each species necropsied. This paper, describing the histology of marmoset colitis, rests principally upon 764 S. f. illigeri, 290 S. f. subspecies, 352 S. o. oedipus, and 138 CaUithrix jacchus (the common marmoset) necropsy observations. TECHNIQUES Complete necropsies were done as soon as possible after death. Only rarely was a dead animal not examined both grossly and microscopically. From 1966 to 1976, all tissues were fixed in Gomori's 1-2-3 fixative, and after 1976 in 10% neutral formalin. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and 4 to 6 p~m sections were cut and routinely stained with PAS-hematoxylin (2). In Table 2 the principal necropsy prosectors are listed chronologically.",

The histology resembles that of so-called, acute, self-limited colitis or acute infectious-type colitis (4). The mucosal changes are typically those of an acute infection: edema, hemorrhage, and leukocytic exudation and infiltration of the lamina propria. Recent ulcerations may be present.

It is present in its most florid form in the cecum and ascending colon where the mucosa is edematous, hyperemic, hemorrhagic, and hypercellular. The lamina propria is variably rich in granulocytes, lymphocytes, and plasmacytes. Acute cryptitis, crypt abscesses, and large intramucosal abscesses are present. The acute granulocytic infiltrations of the crypts are accompanied by lysis of the epithelial cells, which are usually hyperplastic and devoid of mucin production. These mucosal changes are often paralleled by the accumulation of large lymphoid masses below the muscularis mucosae in the submucosa. These often reach sufficient size to appear like Peyer's patche s . Subaeute Colitis. In the next histologic type of colonic inflammation (subacute colitis), reparative changes are most prominent. The glands show greatly increased mitotic activity, tortuosity, and an increase in the height of the columnar cells. The denuded lamina propria (superficial ulcerations) is covered by new sheets of low cuboidal (squamoid) epithelium. The epithelium in the necks of the glands is rich in mucin-producing cells, such that obstruction of the glandular lumen by dystrophic goblet cells and mucin results. Although mucosal fibroplasia is minimal, it does occur in some areas where the glandular epithelium was lost in the acute phase. In the absence of fibroplasia and collagen deposition in such areas, the lamina propria becomes richly infiltrated by lymphocytes which seem to differentiate in the deeper layer of the mucosa into plasmacytes and reticular macrophages ( Figure  1 ). In the reparative exuberance of the crypts in these areas, budding of their deepest tips occurs, producing boot-shaped deformities. These hyperplastic buds proliferate and penetrate through the muscularis mucosae at vascular clefts (Figure 2 and 3) Here nuclear crowding and pleomorphism are found.",

In this phase of the process, the typical histologic picture of chronic ulcerative colitis is produced (5): a greatly thickened mucosa composed of long, irregular glandular crypts that are rich in enlarged, dystrophic goblet cells separated by a densely cellular lymphocytic exudate, plasmacytes, and reticular macrophages. In some cases, this inflammatory response extends through the muscularis mucosae in such volume that the muscularis appears to have been pushed up into the mucosa. This illusion is heightened by hyperplastic epithelial downgrowths into the submucosa where atrophic epithelial lined spaces are formed in the center of masses of lymphocytes. These spaces can become filled with cellular detritus, inflammatory exudate, and mucin, forming large submucosal structures communicating with the intestinal lumen by wide fistulous ducts ( Figure  4) .",

Answering this question would seem at first glance not to be too difficult since only one (S. o. oedipus) of the three marmoset species examined extensively (over 20 years of observation) has developed colonic carcinoma, whereas all three species have extensive chronic colitis. Our preliminary study of this problem involved reviewing the histopathologic changes found in all animals coming to necropsy over the last 20 years. To structure our search, we leaned heavily upon the recently published (Table 1 , page 958 in that publication) was used as the guideline throughout our search. Rather quickly it became apparent that \"dysplasia\" as defined in this study of human biopsy material is not found in entire colons obtained at necropsy of marmosets with chronic colitis even when in situ or invasive carcinomas were present. Our modification of the IBD group's classification schema to include a numerical grade 4 for carcinoma was not a practical solution since the \"positive grades 2 and 3 for low-and high-grade dysplasia\" could not be used to grade our histologic preparations. Since our material is routinely fixed in formalin which \"causes nuclear chromatin to appear relatively condensed\" (p. 964, ref. 2), the absence of hyperchromatism in the basal portion of the crypts in marmoset colons cannot be explained as a histologic artifact.",

Instead, at a stage of reparative epithelial hyperplasia marked by cellular crowding, nuclear pleomorphism, and stratification (but no hyperchromatism), neoplastic transformation is present but not in a histologically recognizable form. It is common in marmosets to find in situ, poorly differentiated carcinoma cells surrounding hyperplastic crypts and with tubular glands appearing to be embedded in them. Occasionally the basal portions of such hyperplastic crypts show loss of basement membrane and spread of poorly differentiated cells into adjacent lamina propria. Such areas are considered by us to be microscopic, malignant foci or a breakout of already transformed cells.",

This lesion ( Figure 5 ) shows how this abrupt neoplastic transformation can occur intraglandularly even when there is no destruction of the basement membrane of the crypt. It illustrates well the absence in this animal of a dysplastic stage as described in terms of human surgical pathology (3, 6) . The cancer cells are seen in this photomicrograph to be budding into the lumen from a low cuboidal epithelium which shows pleomorphic nuclei and little mucin production. The basilar lumen of this crypt contains shed neoplastic cells. The bases of two crypts to the left in the figure show the disarrangement and pleomorphism characteristic of the chronic colitic changes which are associated with this neoplastic transformation. Other glands to the right are more orderly but quite hyperplastic. The noncancerous glandular epithelium in the elongated hyperplastic glands displays extreme dystrophic mucin production. These glands are o n l y slightly tortuous here, but they may be distorted and branching. The edematous stroma of the lamina propria contains slightly increased numbers of lymphocytes but only a few plasmacytes and reticular macrophages. This lesion is present in 10 other sites in this section. Because of this intraluminal origin, this specimen is considered histopathologic proof of the polyclonal nature of colonic carcinogenesis of this species.
