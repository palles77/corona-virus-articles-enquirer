For RNA viruses, cellular or virusencoded RNA helicases play pivotal roles in viral life cycles by remodelling viral RNA structures and/or unwinding viral dsRNA produced during replication. However, no helicase or helicase-like activity has ever been found to associate with any NNSV-encoded proteins, and it is unknown whether the replication of NNSVs requires the participation of any viral or cellular helicase. Here, we show that despite of containing no conserved NTPase/helicase motifs, EBOV VP35 possesses the NTPase and helicase-like activities that can hydrolyse all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helices in an NTP-dependent manner, respectively. Moreover, guanidine hydrochloride, an FDAapproved compound and inhibitor of certain viral helicases, inhibited the NTPase and helicase-like activities of VP35 as well as the replication/transcription of an EBOV minigenome replicon in cells, highlighting the importance of VP35 helicase-like activity during EBOV life cycle. Together, our findings provide the first demonstration of the NTPase/helicase-like activity encoded by EBOV, and would foster our understanding of EBOV and NNSVs.",

            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) is a filamentous, enveloped, nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA virus, belonging to the genus Ebolavirus in the family Filoviridae of the order Mononegavirales. EBOV is highly pathogenic, whose infection causes severe Ebola virus disease (EVD), also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF), in humans with high mortality rates between 25 and 90% (1) (2) (3) . From 2014 to 2016, West Africa has experienced the largest Ebola outbreak in the history that has resulted in more than 28 000 cases and over 11 000 deaths (4) (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014west-africa/index.html). Moreover, the most recent Ebola outbreak is still on-going and deteriorating in DR Congo, which has caused 1290 EVD cases and 833 deaths until 16 April 2019 (http://www.who.int/ebola/situation-reports/ drc-2018/en/). Together with another filovirus, Marburg virus (MARV), EBOV has been classified as a Category A priority pathogen, which imposes a significant threat to global public health (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/ emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens). Thus far, no approved drug or vaccine is commercially available against EBOV.",

NNSVs share common organizations of viral genomic RNAs and similar strategies of transcription and replication (5) . For filoviruses, the (-)-sense viral genomic RNA is approximately 19 kb in length and encodes seven open reading frames (ORFs) for all the viral proteins, i.e. nucleoprotein (NP), viral protein 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein (GP), VP30, VP24, and the large polymerase protein (L) (7) (8) (9) . Upon viral entry into host cells, the released viral genomic (-)-RNAs are used as the templates for the transcription of individual viral mRNAs that are translated into filoviral proteins. The viral genomic (-)-RNAs are then switched to replicate the antigenomic positive-sense (+)-RNAs, which are used as the templates for the production of progeny viral genomic (-)-RNAs (7) . The transcription and replication of EBOV RNAs are carried out by the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that contains the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) L, the polymerase cofactor VP35 (10, 11) , as well as NP and VP30 (12) , which represent the minimal elements required for EBOV transcription and replication (13) .",

            "text": "For most RNA viruses including NNSVs, viral genomic, antigenomic and messenger RNAs contain multiple cisacting elements that play critical roles in viral RNA replication, transcription, translation, and packaging during viral life cycles (14, 15) . Similar with cellular RNAs, these highly structured RNA elements need to be properly folded to be functional. However, the correct folding of RNA molecules is challenging, since RNAs could be kinetically trapped in misfolded states that are relatively stable in thermodynamics (16, 17) . To facilitate the correct folding of RNAs, a variety of RNA remodelling proteins, such as RNA helicases and RNA chaperones, are encoded by cells and viruses. These proteins function to destabilize RNA-RNA or RNA-DNA base-pairings to aid RNAs' proper folding or refolding (18) (19) (20) . In addition, they are believed to participate in the unwinding of viral doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates produced during replication and/or transcription, thereby facilitating the recycling of viral RNA templates for more efficient RNA synthesis. Thus far, a wide range of positive-sense RNA viruses and dsRNA viruses, including picornavirus (21) , norovirus (22) , flavivirus (23, 24) , alphavirus (25) , coronavirus (26) and reovirus (27) , have been found to encode their own RNA helicases and/or RNA chaperones (28, 29) . However, it is unknown whether NNSVs including filoviruses encode any protein with RNA remodelling activity or the replication/transcription of NNSVs requires the participation of any viral RNA remodelling activity. This apparent discrepancy hampers our understanding of this large group of important pathogenic viruses. Filoviral VP35 is an essential polymerase L cofactor that is analogous to the P proteins of other NNSVs (5). In addition, VP35 is a modular multifunctional protein that contains dsRNA-binding and oligomerization domains, and plays pivotal roles in filoviral replication and transcription, nucleocapsid assembly, and evasion of host antiviral defenses (7, (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . Here, we show that EBOV VP35 has an unexpected nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activity, which can hydrolyze all kinds of ribonucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). Strikingly, EBOV VP35 can function like a helicase to unwind RNA helices from 5 to 3 in an NTP-dependent manner. Moreover, we have found that guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), a well-known helicase inhibitor (22, 34, 35) and a U.S. FDA-approved small compound to treat the symptoms of muscle weakness and fatigability associated with Eaton-Lambert syndrome (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index. cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=001546) (36, 37) can inhibit the NTPase and helicase-like activities of VP35 in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, GuHCl has also been found to exhibit inhibitory effect on the replication/transcription of a stable EBOV minigenome replicon in cultured human cells, highlighting the func-tional significance of VP35 s NTPase and helicase-like activities in EBOV life cycle, and implying that targeting the helicase-like activity of VP35 can be a novel strategy to develop antivirals against EBOV.",

To examine if the purified MBP-VP35 is oligomeric (33,46), MBP-VP35 was purified via MBP column and ion-exchange (Supplementary Figure  S2A) , and then subjected to the size-exclusion chromatography analysis using a Superdex 200 column. The purified MBP-VP35 proteins were eluted in the major peak that should correspond to a molecular mass of \u223c600 kDa, while monomeric BSA was used as a control that was eluted in its correct size of \u223c67 kDa (Supplementary Figure S2B) . Although the effect of shape on elution on size exclusion column makes it hard to calculate the exact molecular mass of the MBP-VP35 complex, these results indicate that the purified recombinant MBP-VP35 should be in an oligomeric form.",

Our data showed that MBP-VP35 hydrolyzed all four types of NTPs, with a preference on ATP, GTP and UTP over CTP ( Figure 1A) . Moreover, when increasing concentrations of MBP-VP35 were incubated with ATP, MBP-VP35 can efficiently hydrolyze ATP in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1B ; Supplementary Figure S3 ). Furthermore, because VP35 has NTPase activity, it is intriguing to examine if this protein has NTP-binding activity. Our data show that 5 -ATP agarose can readily pull-down MBP-VP35 but not MBP alone ( Figure 1C) , showing that VP35 does bind to ATP. Of note, MBP protein was expressed and purified exactly same as MBP-VP35, and showed negligible NTP hydrolysis and binding.",

To examine if VP35 has RNA helix unwinding activity, we constructed the standard HEX-labeled RNA helix substrate with both 3 and 5 single-stranded tails by annealing a short 42-nt HEX-labeled RNA1 and a long non-labeled 54-nt RNA2 (as illustrated in Figure 2A) , which was commonly used to determine the helix-unwinding activity previously (34) . The helix-unwinding assay was performed by incubating the RNA helix substrate with MBP-VP35 in a standard unwinding reaction mixture, followed by the separation of the substrate strands via gel electrophoresis. Our data showed that the HEX-labeled RNA strand was efficiently released from the RNA helix substrate in the presence of MBP-VP35 ( Figure 2B, lane 4) , whereas the same helix substrate was not separated when the negative control (MBP alone) was present ( Figure 2B, lane 3) . Of note, the unwinding reactions were performed in the reaction mixture containing ATP and MgCl 2 ; and the boiled helix substrate or the addition of MBP-fusion EV71 2C, a well-characterized viral RNA helicase, was used as positive control for helix unwinding. And the helix-unwinding activity of VP35 is almost as robust as that of EV71 2C ( Figure 2C ).",

Moreover, our results show that the presence of ATP can promote the helixunwinding activity of VP35 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2E) . Additionally, all four types of NTPs could enable VP35 to unwind the RNA helix substrate, and the preference of the helix unwinding activity of VP35 on different NTPs is consistent with that of the VP35 NTPase, as CTP is the least favorable for both activities ( Figure 2F and Figure  1A) .",

After finding that EBOV VP35 has the RNA helix-unwinding activity, we sought to assess its helix unwinding directionality. For this purpose, we used a classic assay by constructing three different RNA helix substrates that are 3 -tailed ( Figure 3A ), 5 -tailed ( Figure 3B ), and blunt ended ( Figure 3C ), respectively. The three helix substrates were then subjected to the RNA helix-unwinding assay by being reacted with purified MBP-VP35. Our results showed that MBP-VP35 efficiently unwound 5 -tailed RNA helix, but barely unwound 3 -tailed one ( Figure 3D ). Moreover, it could not unwind the blunt-ended RNA helix ( Figure 3E ), like other viral helicases such as EV71 2C (34) . To further determine the unwinding directionality of VP35, we evaluated its helix-unwinding activity in each direction in the presence of increasing concentrations of ATP. Our data showed that the increasing concentrations of ATP failed to promote the unwinding of 3 -tailed helix substrate ( Figure 3F ), but efficiently promoted the unwinding of 5tailed helix substrate in a dose-responsive manner ( Figure  3G and 3H). In conclusion, our data demonstrated that EBOV VP35 is able to unwind RNA helix in the directionality of 5 to 3 . ",

Thus, we sought to assess whether the NTPase and helicase-like activities of EBOV VP35 can also be inhibited by this compound. To this end, the ATPase and helix-unwinding assays were conducted in the presence of MBP-VP35 and increasing concentrations of GuHCl. Our data showed that GuHCl could inhibit the ATP hydrolysis ( Figure 8A ) and the RNA helixunwinding by VP35 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure  8B and C). It is worth to note that the inhibitory effects of GuHCl on the ATPase and helicase-like activities of EBOV VP35 are relatively moderate, similarly with the observed effects on EV71 2C and norovirus NS3 (22, 34) . Altogether, GuHCl is an inhibitor of the NTPase and helicase-like activities of EBOV VP35 in vitro. ",

Because the live virus experiments of EBOV can only be conducted in the biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities, EBOV minigenome (MG) replicon systems are usually used to study EBOV replication under common BSL-2 conditions (53, 54) . To this end, we utilized a stable EBOV minigenome replicon system (EBOV replicon cells) that can stably replicate and transcribe the EBOV minigenomic RNA [the Gaussia luciferase (GLuc)-encoding ORF was flanked by the minimal cis-elements located at the two ends of EBOV genome] in Huh7 cells stably expressing NP, VP35, VP30, and L (41). The EBOV replicon cells were treated with GuHCl at the indicated concentrations for 96 h. After that, we examined the cell viability at the doses we applied, and found no obvious cytotoxicity until the concentration of GuHCl up to 2 mM ( Figure 8D ). And 1 mM GuHCl did not affect the expression levels of NP, VP30, VP35 and \u2424-actin (Supplementary Figure S11A) . Then, the replication and transcription of the EBOV minigenome replicon were examined by measuring the levels of GLuc activity, minigenomic viral RNA (vRNA), cRNA (complementary to vRNA; replication intermediate), and viral mRNA. Our data show that both the replication and transcription of the EBOV minigenome were inhibited by GuHCl treatment in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 8E and F).",

Besides, when comparing with transiently transfected minigenome system, this stable EBOV minigenome replicon has been reported to show high level of active minigenome replication, and be relatively stable and even insensitive to IFN treatment or RNA interference, probably due to the persistent replication and the strong viral RNP stability of this minigenome (41) . Therefore, the inhibitory effect of GuHCl on the replication and transcription of EBOV minigenome is quite remarkable. In conclusion, our results show that GuHCl is able to inhibit the replication and transcription of the EBOV minigenome replicon in cultured human cells at the concentrations without apparent cytotoxicity.",

And it is intriguing to ask how the NTPase/helicase-like activity of VP35 functions in the life cycle of EBOV. VP35 is a cofactor of polymerase L and an essential component of filoviral RNP complex, which carries out the EBOV RNA replication and transcription. Thus, it is plausible that VP35 can work together with NP and L to mediate the unwinding of dsRNA intermediates produced during viral RNA replication/transcription, and/or can aid the rearrangement of the cis-acting elements within EBOV mRNA and genomic/antigenomic RNAs, thereby facilitating the transcription, translation and encapsidation of EBOV RNAs or allowing viral RNAs to switch among distinct processes. However, owing to technical limitations, virus-encoded RNA remodeling activities are usually studied in vitro, and it is mostly infeasible to measure the exact roles of RNA helicases on the structures and functionalities of viral RNAs in infected cells (56) . Indeed, GuHCl, an FDA-approved small compound and well-known inhibitor of certain viral helicases, including enterovirus 2C and norovirus NS3, is able to inhibit the NTPase/helicaselike activity of EBOV VP35 as well as EBOV minigenome replication/transcription in cells, implying the functional importance of the VP35-associated RNA remodeling activity in EBOV replication. Future advances in techniques may overcome the technical barriers and provide mechanistic and dynamic views of how VP35 remodels viral RNA molecules at different processes of EBOV life cycle.",

            "text": "According to the conventional view, helicases contain NTPase activity, utilize the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to melt nucleic acid base-pairings, and are thought to participate in most ATP-dependent rearrangements of structured RNAs. Helicases are generally classified into six superfamilies (SFs), designated SF1 to SF6, on the basis of conserved helicase motifs. Interestingly, although EBOV VP35 does not contain any conventional helicase motifs (57, 58) , the NTPase/helicase-like activities of VP35 have most basic biochemical characteristics of canonical RNA helicases, including the NTP-dependency, the requirement of divalent metallic ion, and the directionality of helix unwinding, leading to the question whether the canonical conserved motifs are not necessary for a protein to possess the NTPase and RNA remodeling activities. Factually, Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus (EoV) 2C protein contains the conserved motif A, which is commonly recognized as the core NTP binding and NTPase active site of SF3 helicases (21) , but the NTPase activity of EoV 2C is not dependent on this motif. In addition, the capsid protein VP5 of Helicoverpa armigera cypovirus-5 (HaCPV-5; genus Cypovirus, family Reoviridae) has the NTPase activity, which is also Mg 2+ -dependent and can hydrolyze all kinds of NTPs and dNTPs, but contains no conserved NTPase/helicase motifs (27, 47) . Thus, our current study, together with the previous studies, imply that some of the NTPase and RNA remodeling activities may not strictly rely on conserved motifs in linear sequences of amino acids, but probably determined by more sophisticated active sites formed in tertiary protein structures. In the current study, we have determined that the middle aa. 137-173 region of EBOV VP35 is critical for its NTPase activity. This middle region does not belong to the N-terminal oligomerization domain and the C-terminal IID, both of whose structures have been resolved (45, 50) . Interestingly, although the structure of the VP35 middle region has not been determined yet, the sequence alignment of VP35 proteins from multiple filoviruses, including Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Reston ebolavirus (RESTV), MARV, and Lloviu virus (LLOV) shows that this region is highly conserved within Filoviridae (Supplementary Figure S7A) . And our predicted secondary structure from PSI-blast based secondary structure prediction (PSIPRED) revealed that this region contains a \u2424-strand and an \u2423-helix (Supplementary Figure S7B ) (59, 60) . Besides, the motif scan by using the PROSITE profiles via the MyHits (https://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/ motif scan) suggested that the amino acid T149 of EBOV VP35 is a possible protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site (61) . These analyses highlight the importance of this region in the structure and function of filoviral VP35s. Future studies should reveal whether the \u2424-strand and \u2423-helix as well as the putative PKC phosphorylation site are critical for the NTPase/helicase-like activity of VP35.",

            "text": "An interesting question raised by the current study is that: if RNA remodelling activities are so important to viruses, why helicase or helicase-like activity has never been found in NNSVs before? Indeed, numerous, if not all, DNA viruses and positive-sense RNA viruses have been found to encode their own helicases, which share the conserved NTPase/helicase signature motifs with various host helicases of diverse organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (62, 63) . Based on the conserved motifs, putative helicases can be predicted by bioinformatic algorithms before being biochemically confirmed and characterized. And the lack of conserved helicase signature motifs within EBOV VP35 should be the reason why the NTPase/helicase-like activities were not predicted and identified previously. Moreover, the high conservation of helicase signature motifs suggests that various viral and host helicases share similar origins. On the other hand, the NTPase/helicase-like activities of EBOV VP35 should be evolved independently, suggesting that filoviruses (and probably other NNSVs) have an earlier evolutionary divergence with positive-sense RNA viruses before the latter 'acquire' canonical helicases. More importantly, in the absence of a canonical helicase, EBOV manages to obtain a helicaselike activity instead, highlighting its functional necessity to EBOV. Given that all the members of Filoviridae encode VP35 proteins, which are functionally analogous to the P proteins of other NNSVs (5), future studies by us and others should investigate whether the NTPase/helicase activities are general to other filoviral VP35 as well as NNSV P proteins.",

Guanidines are ubiquitously present in nature, and can function as mediators of specific non-covalent binding in various catalytic processes (64, 67) .
