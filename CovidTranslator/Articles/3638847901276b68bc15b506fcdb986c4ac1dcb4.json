            "text": "SARS main protease is essential for life cycle of SARS coronavirus and may be a key target for developing anti-SARS drugs. Recently, the enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was characterized using a HPLC assay to monitor the formation of products from 11 peptide substrates covering the cleavage sites found in the SARS viral genome. This protease easily dissociated into inactive monomer and the deduced K d of the dimer was 100 lM. In order to detect enzyme activity, the assay needed to be performed at micromolar enzyme concentration. This makes finding the tight inhibitor (nanomolar range IC 50 ) impossible. In this study, we prepared a peptide with fluorescence quenching pair (Dabcyl and Edans) at both ends of a peptide substrate and used this fluorogenic peptide substrate to characterize SARS main protease and screen inhibitors. The fluorogenic peptide gave extremely sensitive signal upon cleavage catalyzed by the protease. Using this substrate, the protease exhibits a significantly higher activity (k cat \u00bc 1:9 s \u00c01 and K m \u00bc 17 lM) compared to the previously reported parameters. Under our assay condition, the enzyme stays as an active dimer without dissociating into monomer and reveals a small K d value (15 nM). This enzyme in conjunction with fluorogenic peptide substrate provides us a suitable tool for identifying potent inhibitors of SARS protease.",

Since then, much effort has been devoted in sequencing the whole genome of the virus [5, 6] , studying the origin of the virus by comparative genetics [7, 8] , solving the crystal structure of the essential main protease and performing computer modeling for structure-based design of its inhibitors [9] [10] [11] , and examining the mechanism of viral infection to identify the human receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 for viral attachment [12] [13] [14] . The main protease which is responsible for maturation of polyproteins in the life cycle of the virus has been proposed as a key target for development of anti-SARS drug [9] [10] [11] . This protein is a chymotrypsin-like protease but uses a Cys rather than a Ser as the nucleophile in the active site, so it is also called chymotrypsin-like or 3Clike protease.",

The deduced dissociation q Abbreviations: SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; Dabcyl, 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid; Edans, 5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Tris, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane; EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, b-ME, b-mercaptoethanol; DTT, dithiothreitol; sqrt, square root. * constant K d of the dimer was estimated to be 100 lM. It was concluded that only the dimer is active from the plot of the kinetic parameter k cat =K m versus the enzyme concentration [15] . The substrate specificity of the protease was established by measuring the kinetic parameters of the enzyme for the 11 peptides which are 11amino acid long with sequences found as possible cleavage sites for the protease in the SARS genome. The best substrate TSAVLQSGFRK-NH 2 displayed a k cat =K m \u00bc 10:6 mM \u00c01 min \u00c01 (k cat \u00bc 12:2 min \u00c01 and K m \u00bc 1:15 mM). These kinetic assays were performed using HPLC to monitor the cleavage of the peptide substrate into two product fragments. Due to the poor enzyme activity, the assay needed to be performed at micromolar enzyme concentration. It is impossible to obtain the tight-binding inhibitors with IC 50 at nanomolar range using this assay format.",

The two fluorophores form a quenching pair and exhibit fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) within the peptide [16, 17] . When the peptide is cleaved by the SARS main protease, the FRET disappears and the fluorescence increases. By monitoring the increase of the fluorescence, the enzyme activity can be detected at sub-nanomolar protein concentration with sufficient sensitivity. The screening for the nanomolar IC 50 inhibitors thus can be performed at the very low enzyme concentration.

As shown in Fig. 4 , at the 0.2 mg/ mL protein concentration, our SARS main protease shows a major peak corresponding to the dimer form. Under the same concentration of SARS protease, previous report showed that the enzyme was a monomer exclusively. At 4 mg/mL of our SARS protease, dimer was also found (Fig. 4) but previous enzyme displayed a mixture of monomer and dimer in this case. However, formation of a small shoulder (<5% of the total absorbance) at the position of monomer may be due to the partial dilution of the protein during the elution in the column or other impurity.

Addition of excess DTT (10 mM) did not further increase the protease activity in our assay (data not shown). Since the enzyme is a chymotrypsinlike protease but uses Cys as the nucleophile to attack its substrate, the inclusion of the extra reducing agents may help to maintain the free thiol form of the active site Cys residue. However, it may also protect the correct protein conformation by preventing the formation of the incorrect disulfide bond in the enzyme. Indeed, the main protease contains 12 Cys residues, totally reduced without forming any disulfide linkage as revealed by its crystal structure [10] .

The previously used peptide substrate only contains 11 amino acids (six in P and five in P 0 positions). The hexa-His tag attached to C-terminus of the enzyme may also interfere with the enzyme activity (Chang et al., unpublished observation). The inclusion of anti-chaotropic agents (10% glycerol and 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 ) as used previously to promote dimer formation in human cytomegalovirus virus [20] in our buffer did not further increase the SARS protease activity since the protease already existed as a dimer under assay condition.

The protease prepared and assayed by us shows only 4-fold larger k cat =K m value for the active dimer but remarkably smaller K d of the dimer compared to the previously prepared enzyme [15] . From the 3-D structure of SARS protease, the N-terminus of one subunit makes close contact with the active site of the other subunit. The importance of the N-finger and dimerization is supported by the fact that a deletion mutant of the related TGEV main protease that lacks residues 1-5 is almost completely inactive [21] . However, the importance of the C-terminus in dimerization for 3CL protease has not been reported until now. In our solved X-ray structure of SARS protease (Wang et al., unpublished results), the C-terminus is indeed very close to the Nterminus. The distance between Phe3 Ca and Ser301 Ca is 11.5 A (we cannot detect the electron density of first 2 amino acids in N-terminus and the last 5 amino acids in C-terminus). His-tag in the C-terminus may interfere with the dimer formation. Using our assay method with active enzyme and fluorogenic substrate, we have shown a sub-micromolar inhibitor as an example and other inhibitors will be reported elsewhere in detail. This sensitive method can be used in finding tight-binding inhibitors of nanomolar and smaller IC 50 for SARS protease as leads for anti-SARS drug discovery.",
