Direct viral detection in the environment poses significant technical problems and the indirect indicators currently in use suffer from serious limitations. The aim of this study was to monitor surfaces and air in hospital settings to reveal the presence of hepatitis C virus, human adenovirus, norovirus, human rotavirus and torque teno virus by nucleic acid assays, in parallel with measurements of total bacterial count and haemoglobin presence. In total, 114 surface and 62 air samples were collected. Bacterial contamination was very low (<1 cfu/cm 2 ) on surfaces, whereas the 'medium' detected value in air was 282 cfu/m 3 . Overall, 19 (16.7%) surface samples tested positive for viral nucleic acids: one for norovirus, one for human adenovirus and 17 (14.9%) for torque teno virus (TTV). Only this latter virus was directly detected in 10 air samples (16.1%). Haemoglobin was found on two surfaces. No relationship was found between viral, biochemical or bacterial indicators. The data obtained confirm the difficulty of assessing viral contamination using bacterial indicators. The frequent detection of TTV suggests its possible use as an indicator for general viral contamination of the environment.",

            "text": "The risk of viral diseases in healthcare settings has important implications for both patients and staff. There are innumerable agents, routes of transmission, procedures and conditions that can cause infections in people attending units such as transfusion centres, laboratories, haemodialysis, infectious disease clinics, intensive care, and surgery, not to mention during clinical waste collection. Bloodborne viruses (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus) are the most widely studied with regard to transmission in healthcare settings, and although epidemiological studies indicate accidents as the primary cause of exposure, there is a hypothetical although not proven possibility of viral transmission via droplets and surfaces. 1, 2 'Airborne' viruses, such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, measles, rubella and mumps viruses and parvovirus B19, are easily spread by 'droplets' that can be inhaled directly or settle on surfaces. Moreover, viral agents transmitted via the faecaleoral route, such as rotavirus, human adenovirus 40 and 41 and norovirus, are frequently associated with healthcare setting infections spread by air, hand and surface contamination. 3 To assess and control the risk of infection in healthcare settings, environmental microbial contamination monitoring can represent an invaluable tool for determining the means of transmission, testing the efficacy of preventive measures, conducting periodic checks of hygiene levels, and alerting staff to the need for preventive measures and ensuring their compliance. 4 However, such monitoring is generally limited to bacterial indicators (mainly total bacterial count) and specific studies on pathogenic agents have rarely taken viruses into account. 5, 6 The biological characteristics, resistance markers, epidemiology and ecology of viral agents are quite different from bacteria, hence the microbial indicators commonly used for environmental monitoring cannot truly represent viral contamination. This has been well documented with regard to water contamination, although, so far, data on healthcare settings remain few. 7 Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess viral contamination on hospital surfaces and in the air using biomolecular tests by contemporaneously testing for the presence of different viral agents. The viruses chosen are considered representative of nosocomial infections commonly transmitted through various routes: hepatitis C virus for the bloodborne route; norovirus and human rotavirus for faecaleoral transmission; and human adenovirus for the respiratory route. Apart from these agents of nosocomial infections, we also considered the torque teno virus (TTV), which, although not clearly associated with any specific disease, is widespread among the healthy population, irrespective of age, sex and any risk factors, reaching a prevalence of 100%. 8 Since TTV DNA has been found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, liver, faeces, urine, saliva, cord blood, amniotic fluid, breast milk, semen, cervical secretions and sewage, it may be regarded as a possible indicator of general viral contamination. 9 Along with viral detection tests, surfaces and aerosols were also monitored for viable bacterial count (VBC). Although this parameter is not strictly associated with contamination, it is generally used to assess hygienic conditions in healthcare settings and the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection procedures. 10 For this reason, it was chosen as a comparison with the data on viral presence. Other specific bacteria were also sought, but were found to be wholly absent from surfaces. In addition, their presence and mean counts in air were so variable that no hypotheses could be made over any association with viruses. Finally, haemoglobin (Hb) determinations were also made. These are commonly used in forensic settings to reveal bloodborne contamination of surfaces, but have also been applied to healthcare settings. 11",

Although this is particularly true for viruses, where detection on surfaces and in air is very difficult, the low reliability of bacterial counts as indicators of viral contamination, suggests studying alternative parameters for assessing virological safety. 7 In the present study, monitoring revealed the presence of viral nucleic acid in 29 out of 176 field samples; adenovirus DNA and norovirus RNA were found only once each and only on surfaces. TTV was detected frequently, with positive findings in 14.9% of surface samples and 16.1% of air samples, indicating environmental contamination consistent with the high prevalence of TTV carriage. Furthermore, the detected strains belonged to the genogroups most widespread in the general population. 23 This study is the first in which TTV has been sought and detected in a hospital setting, hence no comparisons with other studies are possible. The finding of different ratios of positive samples in different hospital units indicates that some areas may be more prone to viral contamination than others. The highest rates of positive results for surfaces were found in the sterilisation centre and bronchoscopy unit, and in the haematology units for air samples.",

Accordingly, such an interpretation seems compatible with the present findings. Since TTV is non-cultivable, environmental longevity has been assessed only through DNA persistence. On surfaces where effective disinfection procedures have been applied (as confirmed by a very low bacterial load), detected TTV could have been inactivated, and its presence indicative only of previous contamination. Moreover, although the antibacterial action of the disinfectant used (1000e5000 ppm of chlorine) has been clearly established as per guidelines for hospital surfaces (5 log 10 reduction), no such data are available for its effect on viruses. This is the case for virion inactivation and degradation of nucleic acids, so that any possible effects on PCR reaction are unknown. 24 In the air, which is not routinely disinfected (as indicated by the mean bacterial counts), TTV could presumably remain viable and possibly lead to airborne transmission. Where the air is filtered, as in sterile rooms, the presence of TTV DNA could indicate that air filters fail to retain the virus. However, the actual significance of its presence cannot be clearly understood without an evaluation of virus viability. Some experimental data (not shown) on TTV DNA persistence on artificially contaminated surfaces following different disinfection procedures have shown that after 2 h treatment with 2.9 ppm chlorine, 64.6% of the initial genome copies were still present. Virus infectivity remained indeterminable because TTV cannot be cultured. The same test, conducted in parallel with HAdV (culturable) revealed the persistence of 23.7% of genome copies and 5.8% viable virus. These data suggest the possible survival of infective TTV on surfaces, though to a lesser extent than suggested by its nucleic acid stability.",
