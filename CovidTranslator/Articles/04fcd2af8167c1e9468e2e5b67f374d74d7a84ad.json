Thus, in 3 the 13 C NMR resonance signal for C-12 (\u03b4 64.9) was shifted downfield, and H-12 (\u03b4 3.52) showed coupling with H-11, placing the hydroxy substituent at C-12. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 4 exhibited a downfield shifted quaternary carbon (\u03b4 72.6, C-11) along with singlet proton resonances for the methyl groups CH 3 -12/CH 3 -13 in the 1 H NMR spectrum, thus the hydroxy substituent had to be placed at C-11. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 5 exhibited only two resonances for methylene groups (C-2, C-3) instead of three such moieties as in 2 -4. Instead of the methylene group CH 2 -8 in 2 -4, in 5 a methine group resonating at \u03b4 68.7 and \u03b4 4.13 in the 13 C and 1 H NMR spectra respectively was found.

The absolute configurations of compounds 2 -5 were established by analyses of CD and NOESY spectra. The CD spectra of the hydroxylated compounds 2 -5 were closely similar to that of (+)-sclerosporin (1), thus the identical absolute configuration can be proposed for compounds 2 -4 (see Table 3 ). However, the configuration at position C-11 in 3 remains unresolved. Interestingly, 5 was the only one with a negative specific rotation (see Table 3 ). This change on specific rotation was most probably caused by the additional stereogenic center at C-8. The configuration at C-8 was established making use of NOESY correlations and 1 H-1 H coupling constants. A NOESY correlation between H-1 and H-6 is in agreement with the configuration of the other sclerosporin derivatives, and further correlations between H-8 and H-6, H-11, H 3 -12, H 3 -13 indicate these protons to be in the same spatial orientation. Furthermore, a 1 H-1 H coupling constant of 8.7 Hz between H-7 and H-8 indicated a trans-type spatial arrangement. Knowing the absolute configuration of H-1, H-6 and H-7 from CD spectroscopic data, we can thus assign the configuration of 5 to be 1R, 6S, 7R, 8S.",
