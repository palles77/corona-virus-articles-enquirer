Quality of water is negatively affected by contamination of various pollutants. Various types of physical, chemical, and biological pollutants emerge from different sources and they deteriorate respective qualities of water. Physical property of water includes electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, and suspended solids. Chemical property is given by composition of various minerals, carbon content, dissolved oxygen, and nitrogen and phosphorus (Christensen et al., 2015) . Biological property refers to presence of various types of microbes and pathogens, especially viruses, bacteria, algae, protozoan, nematodes, insects, and their propagules. Waterborne diseases are any sickness caused by drinking of water polluted with pathogenic microorganisms. There are a variety of pathogenic microorganisms which can cause various types of illness in humans (Table 10 .1).",

            "text": "Based on the source of pollution, wastewater is broadly classified as stormwater runoff, agricultural runoff, industrial wastewater, and domestic wastewater. Stormwater is a kind of raw water formed by natural contamination of pollutants in rain-catchment areas like agricultural field, pond, and forest, etc. (Rippy, 2015) . Other examples of raw water are groundwater abstracted through borehole, rivers, natural and man-made lakes, and reservoirs. The raw water can be supplied for potable use after simple filtration steps and disinfection. After domestic or industrial usage, water is discharged in sewage system. This water, burdened with pollutants and pathogenic microbes, is called as wastewater. Domestic wastewater is categorized as graywater and blackwater. Graywater is generated from kitchen, laundry, and washrooms, while blackwater includes human excreta, i.e., feces and urine discharged from toilets. Well-engineered wastewater treatment plant and zeroenergy constructed wetlands (CWs) are employed to treat domestic wastewater and the treated water can be discharged back to waterbodies (Lee and Scholz, 2006) . Treated or untreated wastewater generated from a treatment plant is known as sewage effluent, which is characterized on the basis of its origin as domestic sewage, hospital sewage, and industrial wastewaters. Domestic sewage is rich in organic content, and thus it contains large number of waterborne pathogens. Hospital sewage is a complex mixture containing sewage and wastewater resulting from the cleaning of laboratories, patient ward, and other facilities. As antibiotics and disinfectants are the major constituents of hospital wastewater, occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is more prevalent (Pauwels and Verstraete, 2006; Jury et al., 2010) . Industrial wastewaters are generated through different industrial activities such as chemical, electrochemical, electronic, petrochemical, and food processing industries. Lack of infrastructure in water distribution system to households also plays an important role in providing clean drinking water. In several cases, drinking water supply pipes are situated close to the blackwater supply pipes. Due to this exceedingly connected piping network, at a time pressure in water supply pipe can be negative or positive relative to the surrounding water. Therefore, in a leaky water distribution system, surrounding chemical and microbial contaminants can easily be mixed with the drinking water supply. A broad range of decentralized and centralized treatment options are available for sewage water. Treated water showed limited growth of microorganisms because of low nutrient levels, and further treatment through disinfectants such as chlorination and ultraviolet (UV) treatment can convert the water in portable form. Although in potable water distribution systems, biofilms are ubiquitously formed and provide a constant source of heterotrophic bacteria (Waluyo, 2017) .",

While the presence of heterotroph does not in itself constitute a human health hazard, they can serve as a means to assess the microbiological quality of the water and the effectiveness of water treatment (Chen et al., 2015) . A large number of process methodologies are in progress for removing or inactivating waterborne pathogens. Chlorination is the most common method of disinfection of potable water, but it is found less effective for Cryptosporidium and thus presents a challenge for its removal from water. The emerging number of resistant microbial strains toward the commonly applied physical and chemical disinfection methods and microbial composition of water are key factors to determine the transmission of emerging waterborne diseases. Thus, treatment technologies should be evaluated according to water quality, quantity, and effectiveness because extensive use of chlorine and chloramines promotes biofilm-forming populations including Mycobacterium. Increased number of adenovirus was reported in surface water treated with UV light. Waterborne pathogens such as Naegleria causing fatal infection showed resistant to chlorine disinfectants and UV light (Horn et al., 2016) .",

Biofilm formation in water transport pipes contributes to the occurrence of heterotrophic bacterial populations in water. Prevention of biofilm formation seems almost impossible because of the rapid microbial attachment on moist surfaces and their fast rate of growth. For the removal of established biofilm, harsh treatment methods such as oxidizing biocides can be applied. The increased uses of antimicrobial chemicals result in emergence of resistant bacteria, which requires new treatment strategies for their control. Thus, for removing such diverse categories of waterborne pathogens, some new targeted, costeffective, and environment-friendly biological solutions such as enzymes, phages, interspecies interactions, and antimicrobial molecules of microbial origin can be used ( Fig. 10 .1) (Corre et al., 2018; Waluyo, 2017) .",

It is an ecofriendly and economically viable approach for enhanced degradation of pollutants by addition of pregrown microbe or microbial cocultures in the medium.

Many refractory pollutants such as halogenated organics, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and pharmaceutical products have emerged out in municipal, hospital, industrial, and agricultural effluents in recent time (Herrero and Stuckey, 2015) . Presence of pollutants such as chlorinated and fluorinated compounds, lignin, cyanides, synthetic dyes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, carbamate, chloroacetamide, and benzimidazole limits bioremediation of industrial wastewater because of its toxicity to native microbial community, less solubility, high stability, and poor bioavailability.

For efficient removal of such biofilms, \"green chemicals\" such as enzyme-based detergents are the favored option. A proteolytic enzyme in combination of surfactants improves the removal of biofilm as surfactant dissolves the biofilm matrix and proteolytic enzymes lyse the microbes staying there (Ben Saad et al., 2019) . In every ecosystem, bacterial population is naturally controlled by bacteriophages (phages). Phages are viruses that infect, replicate, and kill bacteria. Phages provide a species targeted way to eradicate biofilms from pipes. Biofilms are composed of a mixture of bacterial species, so the application of phages has many challenges. Introduction of microbial metabolites is also a related approach for the treatment of complex interlinked network of bacterial species in biofilms. This method depends upon antagonism for substrate that can change the equilibrium of species in the biofilm (Jassim et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "The main sources of waterborne pathogenic disease through drinking water are fecalewatereoral route of transmission (Ashbolt, 2015) . However, there are many pathogenic bacteria of nonfecal origin such as Legionella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, nontuberculous mycobacteria, or free-living amebae, which may colonize engineered water systems primarily within biofilms and sediments (Wang et al., 2017) . This type of pathogenic microorganisms cannot be controlled only by chemical water treatment in engineered water systems before water distribution. Legionella pneumophila is a thin, aerobic, flagellated, nonespore-forming, Gram-negative bacterium recognized as a pathogen causing Legionnaires' disease (LD), a severe pneumonia, and a mild form of illness named Pontiac fever (Diederen, 2008) . L. pneumophila, mostly growing inside free-living protozoa feeding on biofilms, results competitive advantage for its survival. Living inside the protozoan host is advantageous for bacteria in many ways like it can defend against phagocytic destruction and get protected from adverse environmental conditions, nutrient-rich growing condition, and water disinfection procedures (Boamah et al., 2017) . For controlling such type of resistant waterborne pathogenic bacteria such as L. pneumophila, use of a new natural active antibacterial agent proved to be a promising strategy. In spite of the following survival strategy, growth of L. pneumophila in its habitat is also influenced by interactions with bacterial inhabitants found in mixed community biofilms. Interaction of L. pneumophila with the other microbial community in biofilm raises competition for nutrients (Abu Khweek and Amer, 2018) . A study showed that among 80 aquatic bacterial isolates, 55 display antagonistic activity against L. pneumophila. Thus, it is practical to hypothesize that active molecules are locally produced by bacterial competitors which inhibit the growth of L. pneumophila (Guerrieri et al., 2008) .",

As studied by Corre et al. (2018) , bacterial strains were isolated from above-discussed water samples using R2A agar plates within a maximum of 5 h after the original sampling. Isolated strains were purified for morphological and molecular identification. Molecular identification of bacterial isolates was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolated bacterial strains were screened for anti-Legionella activity. A reference strain L. pneumophila serogroup 1 Lens CIP 108286 (Cazalet et al., 2008) was used for anti-Legionella strain selection. Spot-on-lawn assay was used for strain selection described previously by Loiseau et al. (2015) . Various inhibition zones of different diameters were observed, and stain showing maximum diameter was identified as most potent L. pneumophila competitor. Among bacterial isolates of four phyla, that is, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, highest anti-Legionella activity was shown by Firmicutes phylum and the Gammaproteobacteria class (Corre et al., 2018) .",

According to previous reports, L. pneumophila was found to be sensitive to a variety of membrane-active biomolecules (Berjeaud et al., 2016) . Lipopeptides and rhamnolipids derived from Bacillus and Pseudomonas, respectively, might be a potent anti-Legionella compound. In addition, many antimicrobial peptides were found capable of killing Legionella sp. (Berjeaud et al., 2016) . It is clear from above studies that the sensitivity of L. pneumophila to a variety of biomolecules is inadequately understood because of the lack of mechanistic data. Some Pseudomonas strains releasing volatile organic compound (VOC) showed anti-Legionella properties. These strains inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila through VOC. For the first time, Corre et al. (2018) reported a long-range aerial intervention between Pseudomonas and Legionella.

Therefore, a proper domestic wastewater treatment system must be applied to avoid negative impact on public health. There are many physical and chemical methods available for domestic wastewater treatment, but use of biological control methods should be preferred because of its eco-friendly nature (Feichtmayer et al., 2017) . Domestic wastewater is generated through household activities and recreational areas commonly discarded from kitchen, shower, wash basin, toilet, and laundry. Water used in homes except from toilet is known as graywater, whereas the water coming out from toilet is known as blackwater. It contains human faces and urine and can be a cause of waterborne diseases if not treated properly. In domestic wastewater, the solid content is only 0.1% and remaining 99.9% is water. The solids can be present in suspended (30%) as well as in dissolved (70%) state (Waluyo, 2017) . The suspended solids can be removed through physical precipitation, whereas dissolved solid can be treated through biological and chemical methods. Chemically domestic wastewater consists of organic (70%), inorganic (30%), and various dissolved gases. Organic substances present in wastewater are protein 40%e60%, carbohydrate 25%e30%, and oil or fat (Wind, 2007) . Other pollutants usually found in the domestic wastewater are detergent, soaps, shampoo, dishwashing liquid, and disinfectants. To solve the domestic wastewater problem, potential indigenous microbial strains can be utilized for pollutant degradation and removal of pathogens. This can be done through isolation, screening, and identification of the indigenous heterotrophic strains which are detergent-tolerant and antagonistic toward pathogens. These heterotrophic strains either individually or in consortium formula candidates were used to degrade pollutant and eliminate waterborne pathogens (Waluyo, 2017) .",

Heterotrophic bacteria produce certain compounds, found lethal against pathogenic bacteria. These compounds can remove the pathogens by different ways such as affecting cell wall, disturbing cell membrane function, and inhibiting protein and nucleic acid synthesis. Waluyo (2017) has identified four potent bacterial species for detergenttolerant and antagonistic toward pathogen. These isolates are Bacillus thuringiensis strain MSS-2, Bacillus cereus strain BQAR-01, Bacillus cereus strain JDA-1, and Bacillus sp. B31.

In current scenario, broad-spectrum antibiotics are used for killing pathogenic bacteria, in different sectors such as health, agriculture, and waste treatment, etc. (Jassim et al., 2016) . The action of these broad-spectrum antibiotics is not specific; they kill other nonpathogenic bacterial populations and their repeated application develops antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. On the other hand, phages target specific bacteria without harming surrounding normal microflora. Phages are widely distributed on earth, particularly the places colonized by bacterial hosts, such as hospitals, animal farms, slaughterhouses, wastewater, soil waste, and aquatic environments (Jassim and Limoges, 2014) . Phages for various bacterial pathogens can be isolated from the samples collected from different ecological habitats; for example, phages for human pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella serotypes, E. coli, and Bacteroides fragilis have been isolated from human feces. Phages also inhabit a broad variety of raw food products (e.g., meat, chicken, fishes, pulses, biscuit dough, cheese, yoghurt, mushrooms). This indicates occurrence of phages in the same environments inhabited by their bacterial hosts and consumed daily along with food by humans (Calci et al., 1998; Breitbart et al., 2003) . As phages are natural killer of bacteria, they can be used as an alternative of antibiotics. According to recent data, 70% of the existing bacterial population of the world showed resistance to antibiotics because of its extensive use in fields and livestock. As a consequence of this, many bacterial infections and surgeries become more dangerous because of the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, phages emerge as a potential biocontrol agent against many multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria (Jassim et al., 2016; Mulani et al., 2015) .",

According to WEF (2015) announcement, water crisis is the number one global risk, based on impact to society, and is number eight based on likelihood of occurring within 10 years (Weinbauer, 2004) . Throughout the world, there are 750 million people who lack access to safe water. In developing countries, more than 1.5 million children died because of waterborne bacterial infections each year (Fenwick, 2006) . Hunter (2003) reported that in Asian and African countries, the mortality due to contaminated drinking water exceeds 5 million people per year; and children under 5 years of age are the most affected by microbial diseases transmitted through water (Seas et al., 2000) . More than 50% of drinking watereassociated diseases are microbial intestinal infections, among which cholera is the most occurring. Sewage coming from human populations or from livestock is the primary source of pathogenic microorganisms in drinking and recreational water. Therefore, maximum risk for pathogenic microorganism contamination in drinking water is associated with the sewage mixing; it can occur through mixing of drinking water supply with sewage transport system (Jassim and Limoges, 2014) . In recent years because of the extensive increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria stains exploitation of phages as biocontrol agent attracts considerable attention. Phages have many features that make them a suitable biocontrol agent.

Strategy of wastewater treatment through phages requires the initial characterization for occurrence of pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, the first treatment approach should be identification of pathogenic bacteria from wastewater and isolation and enrichment of lytic phages against these species. This phagemediated elimination of bacteria has the competence to control treatment performance by regulating the abundance of pathogenic bacteria (Periasamy and Sundaram, 2013) . Many workers suggested the application of phages directly in wastewater treatment system. In this regard, many studies projected the use of specific phage as an eco-friendly approach for removing filamentous foaming bacteria in activated sludge process system. Several phages showing lytic cycle can potentially be exploited as biocontrol agent for pathogenic bacteria. These studies have concluded that treatment of sewage with phages provides a cost-effective and sustainable method for killing pathogenic bacteria (e.g., E. coli and Salmonella) (Jassim et al., 2016) .",

They were recognized as primary contributor for removal of the majority pollutants in CWs. Different microbial species containing specific functional group is associated with the degradation of each pollutant; therefore, optimized operational conditions that enhance the activity of respective fictional group associated with the degradation of different pollutants will improve the functioning of CWs. There are many naturally occurring rhizospheric bacteria and fungi which facilitates plant growth by promoting the nutrient uptake. These microorganisms also secrete some chemicals which act antagonistically toward plant pathogens. For example, plant growthepromoting rhizobacteria promote plant growth and development by fixing nitrogen and producing phytohormones and induced systemic resistance (Ben Saad et al., 2016) . By introducing antagonistic bacteria in the rhizospheric region of CWs vegetation, waterborne pathogens can be reduced. Ben Saad et al. (2019) have reported the inactivation of pathogenic bacteria Salmonella typhi ATCC 560 in a horizontal subsurface floweCW system planted by Phragmites australis by means of antagonistic bacteria.",

Bacterial species found in the rhizospheric region of CWs have the potential to show antagonism against human pathogenic bacteria. Functioning of CWs in terms of waterborne pathogen removal depends upon the potential antagonistic heterotrophic bacterial species. These types of bacterial species can be isolated from different ecological niches and screened to lab scale and then inoculated in CWs to improve the functioning of these engineered systems. Ben Saad et al. (2019) reported control of S. typhi ATCC 560 by antagonistic bacteria inhabited in rhizosphere of P. australis planted in horizontal subsurface flow CW system. In another study, water and rhizospheric soil samples were collected from different components in the CWs (Ben Saad et al., 2016) . After sampling, isolation, and purification, strains were screened for specific functions such as plant growth promoting by siderophore production, bacterial motility, biofilm production, and antagonist activity against waterborne human pathogenic bacteria. For colonization on plant roots, biofilm formation is important along epidermal tissue. Antagonist test of isolated strains was performed against human pathogenic bacteria S. typhi. The microorganism producing broad range of lytic agents, antimicrobial compounds, antibiotics, bacteriocins, exotoxin proteins, and secondary metabolites showed accomplishment in antagonistic activities. Therefore, these selected bacterial strains have been used to control the density of pathogenic bacteria and improve the water treatment in CWs. This study showed that specific bioinoculation can potentially enhance the pathogenic bacteria removal process. It is an eco-friendly approach to improve water treatment process by CWs, and it highlighted the fact that bioaugmentation can provide a better pathogen removal efficiency (Ben Saad et al., 2019).",

A large number of anti-Legionella strains were identified in freshwater environment creating an unfavorable growth condition for L. pneumophila. In contrast, presence of biofilms and protists in water systems protects this pathogen from natural competitors and harsh treatment conditions. Thus, this pathogen could be biologically controlled by strains acting as L. pneumophila competitors. The mode of action and chemical nature of biomolecules showing anti-Legionella effect requires further research. Detergent-tolerant, heterotrophic bacteria play important role in domestic wastewater treatment and pathogen removal. Superior bacterial strains were identified based on detergent tolerance and pathogen antagonistic. These bacterial species in different combinations could potentially act as decomposer bacteria formula for domestic wastewater treatment.",

In CWs, pathogens are removed through different mechanisms such as natural die-off, sedimentation, inactivation or death due to temperature, predation, oxidation, mechanical filtration, exposure to biocides, and UV radiation. Few current studies confirmed that bioinoculation of appropriate heterotrophic bacterial strains has a clear potential to improve the process of pathogenic bacteria removal. The antagonist substances produced by the inoculated strains are the compounds that inactivate pathogenic bacteria. These antagonist substances immobilized on some natural polymers can be potentially applied in field conditions to inactivate pathogenic bacteria.",
