            "text": "1. The ruling Communist Party in China today bases its fundamental legitimacy on its success in producing an ever-increasing standard of living for its citizens. Current government policies taken to cool off the residential real estate sector have probably already gone too far and are likely to be partly reversed. Residential sales as of early June in 2010 have reportedly dropped dramatically as the result of restrictive government measures put in place. Restrictive policies were implemented not just for macro reasons of preventing overheating but also because of fears of discontent on the part of the average citizen who felt priced out of the market by speculators. The government faces a difficult tightrope of trying to cool the high end of residential housing without overly damaging the economy. negative real interest rates on bank deposits have caused many wealthy Chinese to view owning real estate as they would tangible assets such as gold, which do not produce cash flows. This makes vacancy rates more difficult to interpret than in a U.S. context. Some residential unit purchasers do not expect to live in or rent out their properties. Anecdotal reports suggest a large number of high-end apartments without water and electricity in major cities. Vacancy rates as high as 40% have been reported for some of the major cities and resort areas. The threatened imposition of property taxes-unknown in China at present-would radically change the economics of luxury properties. The most likely scenario is that these taxes, if imposed, will be confined to the high end. 5. The bulls argue that the continuous migration of people from the countryside and China's recent record of rapidly increasing personal incomes may bail out real estate and infrastructure capacity that is put in place before demand actually materializes. China will \"grow into\" its current oversupply of real estate and infrastructure. Global bears are arguing that the number of Chinese yet to move to the cities is actually considerably smaller than is realized and that China is far more urbanized than is widely realized. They further argue that in any case the average Chinese cannot afford the high-end luxury apartments being built. Millions of in-migrant poor people do not make for solid demand for high-end properties. 6. It has been argued that comparisons of house price/income ratios can be misleading due to China's one-child policy. When a first-time home-buying couple buys an apartment, it is often said that six people are buying: the couple and both sets of parents. Global bears dismiss this type of \"China is different\" argument.",

            "text": "The general pattern of real estate bubbles has been one of a rapid rise in real estate values financed by bank debt. When asset values reach extreme values, bubbles burst due to some government action to restrain the process, resulting in a plunge of asset values. Borrowers suffer financial distress as they find themselves in a negative equity position as the value of their mortgages begins to substantially exceed the value of their houses. Banks in turn experience rising nonperforming loans and, in many cases, become insolvent with a significant recession always ensuing. Versions of this model have been put forth by economist Hyman Minsky and financial historian Charles Kindleberger and Aliber (2005) . 1 Further research summarized by Rogoff and Reinhart (2009) China equities and commodities at J.P. Morgan Jill Ulrich (2010) states in the South China Morning Post that the property sector accounted for 21% of Chinese bank loans in 2009. In the article she seems not to be unduly disturbed by real estate price increases in China, but loans classified as real estate may not be the entire story. Shih (2010) has estimated that banks have lent some RMB 11 trillion (US$1.4 trillion) to local government entities, most of this occurring in 2009. If a substantial portion of this has found its way into real estate, then the picture changes. These entities, rather than private individuals or companies, may be significant real estate borrowers.",

The bubble in China has come quickly, mostly during 2009 and the first 5 months of 2010. Most likely many observers are assuming that the government would bail out the banks if the need arose. From the perspective of a short seller, the crucial question is: where is China in the Minsky-Kindleberger model's time line? Is the peak still ahead or has China, in a relatively short time period, managed to produce a debt-driven real estate bubble that is now near its peak? Government authorities are aware of the bubble and, as mentioned, have taken measures to slow it down, something that Minsky and Kindleberger might have approved. However, have the authorities' actions come in time or are they the straw that is breaking the bubble's back? Are they ignoring the root cause of the problem, which lies in an excessively expansive monetary policy and negative real interest rates? What about a failure to revalue the renminbi in 2009? The revaluation in real terms is taking place via inflation, especially asset inflation, in China.",

In fact, bank lending on a large scale cannot be sustained any longer due to the potential risk from industry, as exports are severely affected by the European sovereign debt crisis. In 2011, the Chinese government will combat inflation and limit property-related personal and commercial loans. This will hopefully cool down the transaction volume of the real estate market.

A decline of 30% or more in real estate prices is widely accepted by the central government, but it is not certain that commercial banks can assume such big declines. Possibly a decline of over 50% in real estate prices would likely induce a new wave of financial crisis in China. Therefore, a rapid drop in real estate prices is hazardous to the banking system and the government expects a slow decline. In addition, if the yuan appreciates, then material costs will decrease. For example, if we assume that labor cost and land prices are the same, then property prices should be lower. However, if inflation is high and land prices are high, then property prices will be higher. We believe 15.7 Conclusion 249 that the Chinese government will allow no more than a 5% change in the yuan per year; therefore, it is hard to make solid conclusions. The Chinese government has recognized that a bubble currently exists and has opted to contain real estate prices to maintain a \"harmonious society.\" The above discussion while it may have practical implications should be regarded to be academic discussion.

It is a graph of monthly year-over-year price increase data from a series called \"Sales Price Indices of Buildings in 70 Medium-Large Sized Cities.\" Data are not adjusted for inflation (Figure 15.3). These numbers, augmented by anecdotal evidence from major cities, suggest an unusual pattern. AlthoughFigure 15.3 only begins in 2005, some acceleration of Chinese real estate prices apparently got under way in 2002. It should be remembered that the Asian crisis of 1997 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 had an inhibiting effect on real estate activity not just in China but in Hong Kong as well.Figure 15.3 depicts that the rate of increase accelerated into 2008 and then fell off dramatically. In addition, the global financial crisis in 2008 clearly interrupted price acceleration. Therefore, over the last 12 years, there were three interrupting factors, that is, the Asian crisis, SARS, and the global crisis of 2007-2008, which probably acted as a check on Chinese bubble formation, with real estate price acceleration resuming in 2009. Moreover, most observers believe the numbers upon whichFigure 15.3 are based understate price appreciation in many areas of China. Newspapers in China report year-over-year price increases of 30-50% in major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, as well as in resort areas United States household home mortgage growth (data source: Federal Reserve).such as Hangzhou and Hainan.Figure 15.3 shows that price increase resumes quickly after June 2006. However, price begins to decrease starting May 2010. The change in the first four months of 2011 is close to 0. This means, around 100 in the same chart.",
