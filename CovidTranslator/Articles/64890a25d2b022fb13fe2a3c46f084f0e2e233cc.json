            "text": "Acute fi brinous and organising pneumonia (AFOP) was recently described as an unusual pattern of diffuse lung disease. Particular characteristics make the differential diagnosis with the well recognised clinical patterns of diffuse alveolar damage, cryptogenic organising pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia. The lack of hyaline membranes, the presence of intra-alveolar fi brin, absence of noticeable eosinophils and patchy distribution suggests that AFOP defi ne a distinct histological pattern. The authors describe the case of a woman diagnosed with AFOP after surgical lung biopsy, in association with primary biliary cirrhosis. The patient presented dyspnoea, fatigue, dry cough and thoracic pain. The CT scan showed bilateral patchy infi ltrates predominantly in the lower lobes. Flexible bronchoscopy and subsidiary techniques were inconclusive and biopsy through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery led to anatomopathological diagnosis of AFOP. The patient is having a good clinical response to prednisone.",

It has been reported that AFOP 8 may occur in an idiopathic context or in association with a wide spectrum of clinical conditions, including autoimmune disease, more often collagen vascular diseases (infl ammatory myopathy, juvenile dermatomyositis), adverse drug reactions (amiodarone), occupational or environmental exposures (construction work, coal mining, zoological work), as well as infections ( Haemophilus infl uenzae, Acinetobacter lymphomaairspray ). In this case, despite the percutaneous needle biopsies of the liver showed no abnormalities, the presence of AMA and biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on alkaline phosphatase elevation established the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis. Hyperlipidaemia and hypothyroidism provided corroborative data. Therefore, it was made the diagnosis of AFOP in association with primary biliary cirrhosis. Although there is no clinical report describing this association, AFOP is a new entity that has only a few clinical cases reported, and autoimmune disease is an important and previously described association.",
