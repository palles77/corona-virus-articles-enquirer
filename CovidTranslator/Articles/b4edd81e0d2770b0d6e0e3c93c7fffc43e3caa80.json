When human-to-human transmission was proved, on the 20th of January, the onset of the disease (COVID-19) has changed. 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] According to the China CDC 11 , the case fatality rate (CFR) was 0.2% at the end of January 2020 and 14.4% of the confirmed cases were considered severe or even critical. In the last week of February, 79441 cases were confirmed worldwide (97% in Mainland China) and the number of deaths was 2620 (95% in Mainland China). 12, 13 The epidemiological curves of COVID-19 in China showed the progression of illness in the outbreak over time from December 8, 2019 up to February 11, 2020, 11 when there were a total of 72314 confirmed cases as the geo-temporal spread of COVID- 19. 11 At that time, the majority of confirmed cases occurred in the northern hemisphere and until the last week of February 2020 no confirmed cases had been reported in South America or Africa, except for one .

Although the reproduction number, R0, is the parameter widely accepted to characterize the velocity of spreading, there are different forms of computing it, which tend to lead to different results 22 . On the other hand, the R0 calculation is generally based on assumptions about the epidemic phenomenon such as serial interval distribution 25 or \"the population is closed, that all cases are observed, and use daily case counts only\" 26 . For the reasons mentioned, we opted for a simple/naive model that could assimilate the principal aspects of the variation of COVID-19 cases and translate it into a straightforward measurement (Td) that could be easily comprehended. Obviously, this model has several drawbacks mostly regarding the optimal period where an exponential growth is verified. We studied two different periods sizes and a random starting point aiming to analyse the impact of this aspect and as an attempt to mitigate its consequences. The doubling time values vary with the period size 26% at maximum (Table 1) , which is not neglectable. Even so, this difference only affects slightly the regression coefficients of temperature and humidity, since they do not show statistical differences.",

On the other hand, Jin Bu et al 18 reached the conclusion that continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of the 2019-nCoV and speculate that conditions such as temperature ranging from 13 to 19\u00b0C and humidity between 50% and 80% are suitable for the survival and transmission of this new coronavirus.",

The discussion about the COVID-19 epidemic spread in the northern hemisphere, while low temperatures and high humidity are present, and the unknown, although expectable positive impact of spring and summer in sustaining the epidemy, as its spread into the southern hemisphere was not as epidemic, has aroused our question: how do meteorological variables, such as temperature and humidity, modulate COVID-19 duplication time? Even though there is not yet strong evidence that meteorological conditions may have a role on COVID-19 outbreak or on human transmission, some studies have reported their role in guinea pigs influenza transmission 14 and enveloped virus survival 15 in droplets. Some evidence of a faster spreading of diseases in high humidity levels has been reported, 16 namely for the Legionella disease, although this infection is not caused by a virus. Few papers have been written since mid-February on this topic 17-20 even though the relationship is not perfectly established and more research is required.",
