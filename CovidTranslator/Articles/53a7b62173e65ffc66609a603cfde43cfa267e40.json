We provide a brief history of the Chinese healthcare system since 1949 as context for the current healthcare; examine the factors that led to recent efforts to reestablish community-based care in China; and identify the challenges associated with attaining a sustainable and quality community healthcare system. Methods: Based on literature review and publicly available data in China, the paper will present a historical case study analysis of health policy change of CHOs in China and provide policy evaluation, and the paper provided policy suggestions. Results: We find that the government's recent efforts to emphasize the significance of community healthcare services in China have started to change patterns of healthcare use, but many problems still inhibit the development of CHOs, including unsustainable governmental roles, issues of human resource inadequacy and laggard GP practice, poorly designed payment schemes, patient's trust crisis and continue to inhibit the development of community-based primary care. Conclusions: Additional policy efforts to help CHOs' development are needed. Recent government investments in public health and primary care alone are not sufficient and could not be sustainable. It will not until long-term self-sustaining mechanisms to relieve an omnipotent government are established, including competent community doctors (GP) system, supportive social insurance reimbursement, appropriate financial incentives to providers, better transparency and accountability, as well as a more regulated referral system, a legitimate, sustainable and quality community health system could be attained.",

A new healthcare reform plan, enacted by State Council of China, was released to the public in April 2009. A central feature of the reform plan was a call for the development of community health organizations (CHOs) and establishment of a stronger public health and primary care system. Despite regular efforts to expand them, development of CHOs in China has been erratic. Since the late 1970s, great changes in the healthcare system, along with other social-political and economic changes, have inhibited development of CHOs.",

According to Starfield: Primary care is the means by which the two goals of health service system -optimization of health and equity in distributing resources -are balanced. It is the basic level of care provided equally to everyone. It addresses the most common problems in the community by providing preventive, curative, and rehabilitative services to maximize health and well-being. It integrates care when more than one health problem exists, and deals with the context in which illness exists and influences people's responses to their health problems. It is care that organized and rationalized the deployment of all resources, basic as well as specialized, directed at promoting, maintain, and improving health [p. 1365].",

For example, the 2004 National Healthcare Disparities Report in the U.S. claimed that people receiving care in community health centers receive more of the indicated preventive services than the general population [8] . The supply of primary care providers is also correlated with higher life expectancy at birth and lower infant mortality [25] , lower mortality from all causes [9, 10] , lower disease-specific mortality (Campbell et al.), lower rates of avoidable mortal-ity ( [11] , lower rates of avoidable hospital conditions [12] , and higher self-reported health status [6] . Furthermore, the number of primary care physicians per capita appears to reduce the adverse effects of income inequality on all-cause mortality, heart disease mortality, and cancer mortality [13, 14] . The strength of the international evidence, the 2002 SARS outbreak, and more general dissatisfaction with the performance of its healthcare system encouraged the Chinese government to make primary care a central focus of its recent healthcare reform efforts.

There were two types of first-level hospitals during this period: governmentowned and state-enterprises-owned ones. Government owned basic hospitals were fully subsidized by the level of government with which they were affiliated. This group was open to the general public, enforced welfare pricing (lower than marginal cost) and received full compensation from government. While hospitals owned by state enterprises were financed by Labor Medical Service system, 2 state-enterprise owned hospitals were only opened to the enterprises' employees and their families.

The government reduced its subsidy to stateowned first-level hospitals, which were forced to become more self-reliant. State-owned enterprises withdrew from providing public health and primary healthcare services because of insufficient revenue. A number of first-level hospitals went bankrupt and those that survived turned to profitable medical services rather than emphasizing primary care and prevention. Between 1997 and 2001, the healthcare system saw an increase in higher level hospitals, which emphasize specialty care and high-tech services, but a large decrease in first level hospitals. Data from State Ministry of Health showed that number of basic level hospitals declined by 2892 from 51,535 in 1997 to 48,643 in 2001. During the same four-year time period, second and top level hospitals increased by 405 from 10,789 to 11, 194 (Health Development Report in China between 1997 and 2001) [24] . Reforms since the early 1980s that separated local government's budgeting from that of central government further undermined investment in public health and primary and preventive care. Because local governments tend to emphasize economic development goals, they tend to place less emphasis on health than did the national government. Public health services became feefor-service items and government's investment in public health declined significantly. The percentage of the government's health budget dedicated to public health declined from 12.4% in 1980 to 9.1% in 1990.",

This inflexibility undermines efficiency and makes it difficult to respond effectively to local conditions.

Health education and promotion had almost disappeared during the past several decades. Instead of serving as a gate-keeper for community health, most community-based primary care organizations still act like small-scale hospitals. Rather than serving as complementary components of the healthcare system, as they do in many western healthcare systems, these organizations compete with larger hospitals in China for providers and patients. Unfortunately, they are at a competitive disadvantage because the long history of inferior care at first level hospitals discourages patients from using these centers.

In large hospitals of China, doctors not only receive higher salaries, they also enjoy a greater reputation and opportunities for career development. Thus, it is understandable that medical students are less motivated to engage in community health services. This creates a vicious cycle in China because lower ability of community physician reduces number of patients who are willing to receive care at these centers, which in turn undermined willingness of competent physicians to work in community-based primary care. Generally, the only doctors willing to work in these organizations are those with lower levels of education who cannot secure a position with a larger hospital. This pattern has undermined patient trust on these organizations and the physicians who choose to work in them. General practice as a discipline is newly developed in China, with limited students and educational experience.

In addition to the limitations we described above, existing social insurance policies seemed to be slightly inconsistent with the policies in healthcare reform. For example, social insurance policies do not allow community-based primary care organizations to prescribe some of drugs included in the pharmaceutical reimbursement list. To receive these drugs, patients must go to a large hospital. Because availability of drugs is constrained in community-based settings, some patients may be discouraged from using them as a regular source of care.
