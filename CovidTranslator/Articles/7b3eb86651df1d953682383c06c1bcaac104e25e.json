Influenza A and B samples previously tested positive via the Cepheid Xpert Flu assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) or CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time PCR Diagnostic Panel (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA), while RSV samples previously tested positive via a published real-time PCR assay (Templeton et al., 2004) . LOD experiments were performed for RSV and MERS by spiking virus into negative clinical matrix. When available, leftover extracts from initial clinical diagnostic testing were utilized. When these were not available, the same methods were used to generate new extracts from waste aliquots of the specimens. Nucleic acids were extracted using either the Arrow Viral NA Kit (NorDiag) or the DSP Viral Mini Kit (Qiagen). Extracted nucleic acid was loaded onto individual MAP assay cards, which were then run and analyzed on portable MAP devices according to the manufacturer's instructions.
