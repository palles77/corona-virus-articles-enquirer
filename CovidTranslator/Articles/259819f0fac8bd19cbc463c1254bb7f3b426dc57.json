Twenty-nine out of 150 pooled fecal samples tested positive by reverse transcription-PCR contained fragments of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of coronavirusrelated viruses. The sequences clustered along with bat alphacoronaviruses, forming a subcluster within this group. Our findings point to the need for risk assessment and continued surveillance of coronavirus infections of bats in Brazil.",

            "text": "Bats (order Chiroptera, suborders Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera) are one of the most diverse and widely distributed groups of mammals, representing *20 % of all known mammalian species [1] . About a 100 different viruses have been identified in bats of different species in Asia, Europe, North America and Africa. Therefore, such species may be natural reservoirs for a large variety of potentially zoonotic RNA viruses, such as lyssaviruses, paramyxoviruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses as well as the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . A variety of other coronaviruses have been detected in many bat species from Asia, including specimens of the genus Rhinolophus, which were found to be infected with SARS-like CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of such viruses revealed that those form a large clade within Betacoronavirus genus, along with SARS coronaviruses from palm civets and the SARS coronaviruses recovered from humans during the 2003 outbreak [7, 8] . These data suggested that the agent responsible for the 2002-2003 pandemic might have originated from bats. In addition, in 2012, a new human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC), which has been associated to clinical disease that resembles SARS, emerged in the Middle East. This new virus appears to have originated from bats, raising the possibility that HCoV-EMC jumped species directly from bats to humans [9] .",

Standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination; blank controls without template were included in every set of five RT-PCR assays. Five microliters of the PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5 % agarose gels and the products visualized on UV light after staining with ethidium bromide.

Genetic analyses provided evidence that the viruses circulating in these two species of insectivorous bats belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus. When compared with each other, all the obtained sequences showed a high nucleotide and amino acid identity (90.6 to 100 % and 98 to 100 %, respectively) (supplemental material). The RdRp sequences examined here were distantly related (\\75 % nt identity) to other known alphacoronaviruses. The closest bat coronaviruses RdRp sequences found in GenBank were the Asian (BtCoV/A633/2005) and North American (RM-BtCoV 6 and RM-BatCoV 11) bat coronaviruses (Fig. 1) . The percentage of nucleotide similarity between the sequences described here and those of Asian and North American coronaviruses ranged from 72.4 to 76 %, whereas at the amino acid level, the similarity ranged from 74 to 81 % (data not shown).",

The tree was generated based on the neighbor joining method in the MEGA program. The nucleotide sequence of the equivalent genome fragment of SARS-CoV was included as outgroup (Fig. 1) . These results show that similar coronaviruses are found in different bat species that are distributed in geographically distant regions, suggesting a low degree of host restriction for coronavirus in those bat populations. In contrast to the enormous diversity of CoV genomes found in Old World bats [12, 25] , in this study and in several others concerning the CoV detection in New World bats, only alphacoronaviruses were detected [2, 3, 17, 18] .
