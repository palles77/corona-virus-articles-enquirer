Enlargement of the left supraclavicular node, in particular, should suggest a malignant disease (e.g., malignant lymphoma or rhabdomyosarcoma) arising in the abdomen and spreading via the thoracic duct to the left supraclavicular area. Enlargement of the right supraclavicular node indicates intrathoracic lesions because this node drains the superior areas of the lungs and mediastinum. Palpable supraclavicular nodes are an indication for a thorough search for intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pathology.",

Nodes due to infection or inflammation are generally warm, tender and fluctuant. If infection is considered to be the cause of the adenopathy, it is reasonable to perform a 2-week trial of antibiotic therapy. Failure to produce a reduction in the size of the lymph node within this period is an indication for careful observation.
