School closure (also called class dismissal in North America) is a non-pharmaceutical intervention that is commonly suggested for mitigating infl uenza pandemics. Health offi cials taking the decision to close schools must weigh the potential health benefi ts of reducing transmission and thus case numbers against high economic and social costs, diffi cult ethical issues, and the possible disruption of key services such as health care. Also, if schools are expected to close as a deliberate policy option, or just because of high levels of staff absenteeism, it is important to plan to mitigate the negative features of closure. In this context, there is still debate about if, when, and how school closure policy should be used. In this Review, we take a multidisciplinary and holistic perspective and review the multiple aspects of school closure as a public health policy. Implications for the mitigation of the swine-origin infl uenza A H1N1 pandemic are also discussed.

            "text": "On June 17, 2009 , 85 countries had offi cially reported 39 620 cases of swine-origin infl uenza A H1N1 virus infection to WHO, 1 including 167 deaths. On June 11, 2009 , WHO raised the level of infl uenza pandemic alert from phase fi ve to phase six, offi cially declaring that a pandemic had began while at the same time stating it was of moderate severity, noting that most infected people, including children, had a mild self-limiting disease. 2 In this context, health offi cials around the world are carefully reviewing their pandemic mitigation protocols. School closure (panel 1) is a non-pharmaceutical intervention often suggested for mitigating infl uenza pandemics. 3 In pandemic prepared ness plans, rationales for school closures are that children are thought to be important vectors of transmission and more infectious and susceptible to most infl uenza strains than adults, and high contact rates in schools favour transmission. These are strong arguments in the current situation, where 60% of cases infected with H1N1 are 18 years old or younger 4,5 and many of case clusters have happened in schools. It is therefore hoped that closure of schools during the pandemic might break the chains of transmission, with the following potential benefi ts: reducing the total number of cases; slowing the epidemic to give more time for vaccine production; and reducing the incidence of cases at the peak of the epidemic, limiting both the stress on health-care systems and peak absenteeism in the general population, and thus increasing community-wide resilience.",

[6] [7] [8] There is no consensus on the scale of the benefi ts to be expected, 6, 9, 10 and recent reviews highlighted the lack of evidence for social distancing measures such as school closure. 11, 12 Even if benefi ts are substantial, they must be weighed against the potential high economic and social costs of proactively closing schools, which also can have negative eff ects on key workers since, for example, many doctors and nurses are also parents. Important operational issues related to school closures, though not impossible to overcome, need preparation (panel 2). Communication of the policy to the public also poses challenges, especially in a context where some countries (or even regions within a country) might close schools proactively, others perhaps only reactively, and some not at all. But since historical experience is that many schools close during pandemics just because of high levels of illness-related absenteeism, it would seem sensible for all countries to at least have plans for reactive closure.",

However, although we discuss key conclusions and fi ndings of pandemic models, it is not our intention to do a detailed review of the subject (Halloran and colleagues 28 review the fi ndings of three models). In short, some models suggest that school closure combined with keeping all children at home might be suffi cient to stop a pandemic, 6 whereas others found a marginal eff ect on epidemic size but a substantial reduction of peak incidence. 10 Those diff erences in model outputs are because of diff erences in modelling assumptions. For example, if it is assumed that 50% of transmissions occur in schools, a conclusion will follow that closure of schools will have an important eff ect on spread, especially if children can be kept apart outside of school. By contrast, if only 20% of transmissions happen in schools, a much smaller eff ect of closures is expected. Whether the 20% or 50% scenario is the most likely cannot be determined a priori (and this might vary between pandemics as well as between cultures or Review settings-eg, urban vs rural). Modelling does not therefore provide primary evidence of the likely eff ect of school closure on transmission. Instead, it is necessary to carefully review what can be inferred from seasonal infl uenza epidemics and previous pandemics.",

A simplistic comparison of attack rates before and during school closure would conclude that the intervention had an important eff ect on spread. But in an infl uenza outbreak that has just peaked, such a reduction is expected even if there is no intervention. Figure 1 shows that the reduction after the peak in 2008 (when school closure was implemented) was essentially indistinguishable from that of 2007 (when schools remained open). Relying on the temporal pattern of the eff ective reproduction number (average number of people infected by a typical case) derived from sentinel surveillance data, Cowling and colleagues 15 detected no signifi cant eff ect of school closure on infl uenza spread in this outbreak.",

They found 22% reductions in weekly numbers of physician visits and emergency department visits and 43% reductions in weekly numbers of respiratory tract infection diagnoses and of viral infections. However, as shown in the Hong Kong example, simple comparison of attack rates can give misleading conclusions because of the intrinsically non-stationary dynamics of a seasonal epidemic. However, in the Israeli example, the strike ended while the infl uenza outbreak was ongoing, and respiratory illness visit rates rebounded, suggesting that the strike likely had an eff ect on spread.

Under the assumptions made in their simulation model 33 and assuming 2\u00b75 person days per week time loss for aff ected households and 5 days per week for teachers during school closure, they estimated a high economic cost of school closure (about US$2\u00b77 million per 1000 population or 6% of GDP) and that strategies involving school closure would be between 14 and 21 times as costly as intervention strategies with antiviral drugs or prevaccination alone.

In the American survey, 21 25% of 664 adults who had major responsibility for children 17 years old or younger reported that a child in their household gets free breakfast or lunch at school or daycare. 34% of these 166 recipients of free meals said that not getting them during a 3-month closure would be a problem. Hence, in areas of the USA where schools have such extraeducational social functions, planning is being made to ensure the continuity of these services, and the term class dismissal is preferred to school closure (panel 1).",

Some studies have found that, despite children being poorly equipped to care for themselves, parents overestimate their child's ability to self-care. 20 Children left in self-care, often from low- Review income households, suff er from more behavioural and social problems. 20 Furthermore, studies of education performance show that declines after the long summer holidays are largest for children from poor and minority backgrounds. 20 The same type of social inequality should be expected after prolonged school closure during a pandemic. Households with a low income or from minority groups are particularly exposed to serious fi nancial problems if schools are closed for a prolonged period. For example, Blendon and colleagues 21 found that 93% of 91 lowincome households (less than $25 000) would have serious fi nancial problems if they had to stay home for 3 months, as opposed to 64% for 406 high-salary income households ($75 000 or more). The proportion drops to 84% and 37%, respectively, if they had to stay home for a month.",

In a survey, Dalton and colleagues 22 found that 38% (33 of 72 people surveyed) of the Australian public health workforce might be absent from work if schools closed during a pandemic. A survey of over 5000 hospital doctors and nurses by the UK Department of Health found that 77% of respondents were women (78% of UK doctors and nurses are women), 50% of respondents had a dependent child under 16, and 21% of respondents reported they would likely be absent from work if schools closed during a pandemic.

            "text": "Three historical datasets (1918 US cities, 1957 French pandemic, and 2008 Hong Kong outbreak) highlight the crucial importance of the timing of an intervention. For the Hong Kong 2008 and French 1957 pandemic examples, the intervention inevitably failed to have a detectable eff ect because of its implementation very late in the outbreak. Modelling suggests that if schools can be closed before 1% of the population get sick, the eff ect of the intervention remains close to maximum. 28 The desirability of closing schools at an early stage of local epidemics raises several questions about implementation and triggers (panel 2). One option would be to implement local reactive school closure-closing schools when a transmission of the pandemic strain is detected in the school or in a particular area. One risk for such an approach is that local surveillance might be lacking in sensitivity or promptness, meaning schools are closed too late. False positives might also be an issue, given surveillance of infl uenza-like illnesses will probably not be able to distinguish between pandemic infl uenza and other respiratory disease outbreaks. The second option is synchronised national (or, in larger countries, regional) closures that have the benefi ts of consistency and simplicity; they can rely on national surveillance systems that are expected to be more robust than local mechanisms. The health eff ect of national or regional closure is expected to be more substantial than that of local closure, but with a higher economic and social cost, since schools might be closed for longer and in areas with low local incidence. This is a particular issue with the highly heterogeneous pattern of the H1N1 pandemic so far, even within a single small country such as the UK. 34 The trigger for closure (whether local or national) is also crucial. Use of a trigger based on school absenteeism rates might lead to closure occurring only late into the epidemic, limiting any eff ect on spread. Even relying on sentinel surveillance of infl uenza-like illnesses might lead to decisions being made too late, given the limited sensitivity of such surveillance and the background incidence of non-infl uenza related illnesses. Arguably, triggers based on virological identifi cation of the fi rst few hundred pandemic infl uenza cases identifi ed in a country might be the most reliable, but as the H1N1 pandemic is Review demonstrating, seasonal variation in infl uenza transmission could mean that such a sensitive trigger might lead to schools being closed for months. Even if triggers could be identifi ed that took account of seasonality in the intensity of transmission but reliably initiated closure when only a one or two percent of the population had been infected (needed for maximum eff ect), schools could still end up being closed for 12-16 weeks. The decision to reopen schools might be equally challenging. An important limitation of social distancing measures is that their eff ect stops as soon as the intervention is relaxed. There were various examples in US cities in the autumn of 1918, in which the lifting of interventions was associated with a second peak in the outbreak. Lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions therefore requires some assurance that population herdimmunity has been reached-whether through immunisation or natural infection. Cross-sectional seroprevalence surveys would be the most reliable method of determining if the population has suffi cient collective immunity, but proxy measures might be able to be identifi ed. Another possible rule-of-thumb is to reopen schools only once children (or the general population) have been immunised with a pandemic vaccine.",

A few have centralised command and control systems that would allow central decisions, but many have highly decentralised systems. The USA also has localised decision making on education. Establishing national policies in such countries poses challenges. 24 Reactive closure of schools can be seen as inevitable because of staff or pupil absenteeism resulting from illness or fear of infection. Plans at the national, local, and school levels are therefore needed irrespective of whether proactive closure is planned. Equally, all families with school children should be encouraged to think what they would do if schools closed for an extended period (panel 2). The unintended social consequences of school closure would also be minimised if countries carefully assessed how their legal and welfare systems, plus the charitable sector, could help and protect workers who cannot attend work because of school closure.",

France, which plans to close schools in a pandemic, intends to use TV and radio to broadcast lessons, coupled with direct interaction between pupils and teachers by telephone or internet communication. 35 In today's worldwide, multisource, constant news media, both the public and the authorities in one area will be very aware of developments in other regions and countries. Information on deaths among children and whether proactive or reactive school closure is being used in countries that are aff ected early will undoubtedly be reported. Given that the public and media see threats to children's health with particular concern, interest is likely to be intense as to whether, why, and when schools will be closed in European countries. Use of school closure as a public health policy also gives the implication that school attendance poses a risk, so it is likely that some parents will think about withholding their children from school irrespective of offi cial policy. In addition, some teachers might also fear for their health, and head teachers and school administrators will be seeking advice. Good, consistent communication will therefore be essential.",

This is illustrated by the recommendations that have been made by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which contrast with earlier recommendations. 39, 40 On the basis of information that many cases in the Mexican epidemic had severe illness, the CDC initially recommended school closure as an option to lessen the risk of infection from a potentially severe disease. However, as estimates of severity were revised downward, recommendations were changed and the early identifi cation and isolation of ill students and staff became the primary method to reduce the spread of infl uenza in schools. 40 The use of stringent and costly measures such as school closure should indeed be based on age-specifi c estimates of severity and local morbidity indicators. It is important to emphasise again that the WHO phases are not an indication of severity (phase six only means that there is a sustained spread of the virus in diff erent continents); WHO now makes parallel statements on severity and geographical spread. 41, 42 School closure will of course not be the only intervention used in a pandemic; it should be considered in combination with other interventions that are available, such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other nonpharmaceutical interventions. Modelling suggests that, in certain circumstances, the combined eff ect of a set of interventions might be larger than the sum of the individual impacts. 28 This can happen when the diff erent interventions are complementary, targeting diff erent places or groups of individuals (eg, school closure and banning of mass gatherings and closure of selected workplaces). However, if the interventions target the same place or group of individuals, then the combined eff ect might be smaller than the sum of the individual impacts. For example, if children are vaccinated, the additional benefi ts gained by closing schools might be very small. These complexities mean that predicting the eff ect of combined interventions is challenging, and modelling has an important role in assessing likely impact. But it is important as new data become available on the eff ectiveness of individual interventions-such as the eff ect of school closure 14 -that model parameters and predictions are updated.",

Another important uncertainty for pandemic planning is that individuals are likely to change their behaviours during a pandemic in a way that is diffi cult to predict. There is, for example, evidence that people reduced their contacts during the 1918 pandemic when mortality was high. 18, 31 The ways children mix with each other during a prolonged school closure remain a key uncertainty, likely to be infl uenced by the severity of the pandemic.",

            "text": "This Review highlights that there are still many uncertainties about the health, economic, and social implications of closing schools to mitigate an infl uenza pandemic. Research priorities to reduce this knowledge gap include: \u2022 Detailed outbreak investigations in schools (before, during, and after closure) along with detailed follow- Review up of households of students. Such studies will provide information on the health benefi ts for students and their families and allow better understanding of transmission dynamics within the school and school-household interactions. Outbreaks that are investigated are usually atypical, in the sense that they are expected to be larger than an average school outbreak. Caution is therefore necessary when extrapolating from those outbreaks to nationwide estimates. For this reason, a metaanalysis will be particularly useful. \u2022 As part of the same studies, the economic and social impact of the closure on households should be established. Linking the epidemiological and economic components of household questionnaires will allow investigation of the cost-eff ectiveness of the intervention. \u2022 Collecting data on activities and interactions with other children during school term and during school closure. So far, the absence of such data reduces our ability to assess the eff ect of school closure on infl uenza spread, namely we do not know how mixing patterns of children outside school are modifi ed when schools close (so-called compensatory behaviours). \u2022 Assessing the eff ect of school closure on transmission in the wider community (ie, not just children and their families). This will be more challenging since it will require collecting good incidence data at a geographical resolution that matches the catchment area of the schools. Such spatial resolution cannot be achieved with traditional surveillance networks, so non-conventional approaches (such as polls organised by phone or on the web) will have to be considered. \u2022 There is also a need to refi ne our understanding of the implications of school closure for health-care and other essential services. This could be done through surveys of health-care managers and workers.",
