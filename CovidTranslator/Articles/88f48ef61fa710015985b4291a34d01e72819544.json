            "text": "In contrast to BALB/c mouse macrophages, the A/J macrophages after activation by interferon gamma (IFN gamma) develop an anti-MHV3 effect which correlates with the resistance to virus infection. To understand the cellular basis of this antiviral effect, we studied the possible involvement of arginine metabolism through nitric oxide (NO) and arginase induction, since these metabolic pathways have been described as implicated in antiviral activities of macrophages. The studies were performed by activating macrophages with inducers of NO (IFN gamma) and arginase (IL4 IL10). NO synthase (iNOS) and arginase inhibitors (N-methyl-arginine, NMA, and hydroxyarginine, OH-ARG) were used. The results show that in both macrophage populations, no spontaneous synthesis of NO occurred and the MHV3 enhanced the NO release induced by IFN gamma. After activation with IFN gamma, BALB/c macrophages released higher amounts of NO than the A/J macrophages. The inhibition of IFN gamma-induced NO-synthesis with NMA or with arginine free medium did not affect the virus replication. In BALB/c macrophages, IL4 or IL10, induced higher amounts of arginase than in A/J macrophages. In both macrophage populations the MHV3 infection had no influence on the arginase synthesized, and the inhibition of the arginase with OH-ARG had no influence on the virus growth. The level of MHV3 replication or inhibition was also not influenced when we used macrophages from knockout mice for the iNOS gene, and as a consequence were unable of synthesizing NO. These data indicate that NO and arginase do not participate in the anti-MHV3 state induced by IFN gamma in macrophages.",

The differential magnitude of the antiviral state induced by interferon gamma (IFN gamma) in macrophages from resistant (A/J) and susceptible (BALB/c) mouse strains were shown to be speci\u00aec for MHV3, correlating with the host resistance to the experimental viral infection [25] . Our previous studies have shown that resistance to MHV3 infection in mouse populations can be a consequence of a T-cell dependent mechanism, in which the production of IFN gamma and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN gamma play an essential role [19, 20, 25, 36, 37] .",

The inhibition of ectromelia, vaccinia and herpes simplex 1 viruses in IFN gamma activated mouse macrophages correlated with the cell production of NO [11, 13] . It has been shown the iNOS induced in macrophages of mice infected with Coxsackie B3 virus and a higher mortality of these infected mice when fed iNOS inhibitors [18] . A direct antiviral effect of NO with inhibition of vaccinia virus replication at the level of DNA synthesis has also been shown [24] . Recent \u00aendings indicate that NO prevents Epstein-Barr virus replication by inhibiting viral DNA ampli\u00aecation and by blocking activation of the latent viral genome [14] . Published data suggest that signaling requirement of NF-kB activation and NO production in Newcastle disease virus-treated macrophages are similar [34] . On the other hand, there are indications that NO may not be essential for the virus clearance, since treatment of vaccinia virus-infected mice with the iNOS inhibitor did not alter the course of infection [30] . In a recent publication, Kreil and Eibl [16] showed that NO has no antiviral activity against tick-borne encephalitis virus infection in murine macrophages and can even contribute to pathogenesis in experimental infection.",

We have shown that the MHV3-susceptible BALB/c mice have macrophages where the virus can grow to high titers and are not restricted when they are activated with IFN gamma. In contrast, the MHV3-resistant A/J mice have macrophages that respond to IFN gamma activation, partially restricting the virus growth [19, 20, 25, 36, 37] .

Following stimulation with IFN gamma or IL4/IL10, the BALB/c mouse macrophages were always capable of synthesizing higher amounts of, respectively, NO or arginase, when compared to what we obtained with A/J mouse macrophages. As expected, when the cultures were performed in the presence of arginine free medium or NMA or both, a drastic decrease in the synthesis of NO was observed (Fig. 1) . The MHV3 infection was capable to further enhance the NO release in both cell populations but did not in\u00afuence the arginase expression, the lower levels observed in MHV3-infected BALB/c mouse macrophages being due to the cell destruction taking place during the virus infection ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ). Con\u00aerming previous reported data [26] , the IFN gamma treatment had a small suppressive effect on the arginase expression in both macrophage populations. The partial inhibition of virus replication, which is induced by IFN gamma in A/J mouse macrophages, could not be reversed by macrophages treatment with NO or arginase inhibitors. Also, the MHV3 replication in IFN gamma activated or not activated BALB/c macrophages was not in\u00afuenced by treatment with NO or arginase inhibitors.",
