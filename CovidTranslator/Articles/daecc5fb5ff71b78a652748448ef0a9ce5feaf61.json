To gain a better understanding of SARS-CoV replication and transcription proteins, a preliminary X-ray crystallographic study of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) is reported here. The C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV nsp2 was cloned, overexpressed, purified and crystallized using polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethyl ether as the precipitant; the crystals diffracted to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution. The crystals belonged to space group P6 5 , with unit-cell parameters a = b = 112.8, c = 91.1 \u00c5 , = = 90, = 120 . One molecule is assumed to be present per asymmetric unit, which gives a Matthews coefficient of 2.89 \u00c5 3 Da \u00c01 and a solvent content of 56.2%.",

However, the structure and function of nsp2 from either SARS-CoV or related coronaviruses have remained uncharacterized. To date, the only reported crystal structure of a coronavirus nsp2 is that of the N-terminal domain of nsp2 from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; Yang et al., 2009) , a representive of the group 3 coronaviruses which is quite different from SARS-CoV nsp2 in primary sequence (with a sequence identity of less than 20%) and gene locus (with no nsp1 prior to nsp2 in IBV). Meanwhile, owing to a lack of research on nsp2-deficient viruses in animal models or on changes in host environment resulting from nsp2 deficiency, it has been widely accepted that nsp2 replicase proteins are dispensable for replication of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV in cell culture owing to the detection of genomic and subgenomic RNA production of nsp2-deficient viruses in cell culture (Graham et al., 2005) .",

The PCR product was digested by BamHI and NotI and ligated into a pGEX-6p-1 expression vector (Pharmacia, New York, USA). The integrity of the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. SARS-CoV nsp2C was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Merck, USA) as a GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion protein. A selenomethionyl (SeMet) derivative of nsp2C was prepared using the method of methionine-biosynthesis pathway inhibition. Expression of native and SeMet-derivative nsp2C was performed in 0.8 l Luria-Bertani medium and M9 medium, respectively, which was incubated at 310 K until the OD 600 reached about 0.6. SARS-CoV nsp2C expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl -d-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for an additional 16 h at 289 K.

Lane 2, purified nsp2C after GST (glutathione S-transferase) affinity column chromatography. The molecular weight of GST-nsp2C is 84 kDa, as indicated by a black arrow.

After several iterations of density modification using both the DM and SHARP programs, the phases were greatly improved, with most of the amino-acid residues being clearly interpretable (Fig. 4) ; exceptions were the C-terminal end, which consists mostly of loop and coil, as well as electron density in some regions owing to flexibility.
