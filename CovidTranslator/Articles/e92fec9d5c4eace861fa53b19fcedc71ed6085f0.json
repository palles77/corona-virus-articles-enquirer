In developing countries, respiratory illnesses are responsible for the deaths of \u223c 4 million children per year [2] . On average, preschool children encounter 6 -10 episodes of respiratory illness per year and experience symptoms during 30 -40% of the year; adults usually experience 2 -4 episodes over the same period [3] [4] [5] . Approximately 200 viruses are involved and these include, in order of importance, influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) [8, 9] , rhinoviruses, coronaviruses (including the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus), coxsackieviruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), human metapneumoviruses (hMPVs) and adenoviruses [6] .

It is widely believed that live vaccines administered directly to the respiratory tract offer the prospect of producing a much broader and long-lasting protection than parenterally administered killed vaccines [9, 10] . Live vaccines induce the same repertoire of IgM, IgG, local or secretory IgA antibody and cell-mediated responses as those induced by natural infections [11, 12] . Vaccine viruses replicate to a limited extent in the respiratory tract and so induce responses to many more epitopes than is possible with nonreplicating antigens [13] . A further potential advantage of mucosal compared with parenteral vaccination is that immune responses can be induced in the presence of maternal antibody [14] . Effective live vaccines require the use of viruses that are suitably attenuated and, at the same time, immunogenic and capable of in vitro growth to economic titres for vaccine production.",

Concerns about the use of a live vaccine in the face of a new pandemic are related to the possibility that reassortment occurs between the genes of the pandemic virus and those of the live influenza A vaccine to produce virus(es) of unpredictable virulence. These concerns are much diminished during interpandemic periods, where the surface antigen genes of both the epidemic and vaccine reassortants are similar. Inactivated vaccines will be required and particular issues relating to work safety will arise if, for example, avian (H5N1) strains, which have become endemic in avian species in many regions of Asia, replace H1N1 and H3N2 viruses as predominant human influenza A subtypes [18] .",

            "text": "Many attempts have been made to produce live virus vaccines against other respiratory viruses using traditional techniques, such as multiple cold-passage [19, 20] or chemical mutagenesis [21] . Attempts to develop live vaccines have been pursued because of failures at inactivated vaccine development. The most notable of these was the attempted development of a formalin-inactivated vaccine against RSV, in which vaccinated infants exhibited enhanced immunopathology following natural RSV challenge [22, 23] . Similarly, attempts to develop inactivated vaccines against paramyxoviruses and rhinoviruses have been unsuccessful [24, 25] . The sheer number of rhinovirus serotypes (> 100) is a significant disincentive to attempts at vaccine development, and most efforts aimed at the prevention of rhinoviruses have been directed towards the development of group-specific antiviral chemotherapeutic agents. Similar considerations apply to adenoviruses, which, unlike other respiratory viruses, possess a double-stranded DNA genome. However, a live vaccine against serotype 4 has been developed for institutional use, which is delivered as an enteric capsule; respiratory immunity is developed by the common mucosal pathway [26] . Non-SARS coronaviruses have an important role in the aetiology of common colds [27] , but are technically too difficult to grow in cell culture to be considered for vaccine development. The SARS coronavirus, on the other hand, grows readily in cell culture and inactivated viruses have been shown to induce a high level of neutralising antibody in BALB/c mice [28] . If required, a cell culture-derived inactivated vaccine could be developed as a preventive measure against SARS, but, as with pandemic influenza viruses, the manufacturing process represents a significant biohazard and the need for robust measures of biological containment. As with potential pandemic influenza strains, it would be highly desirable to disarm the virus by specifically modifying genes associated with virulence by reverse genetics.",

The RSV reverse genetics system described by Collins et al. [44] comprised a cDNA copy of the RSV antigenome with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5\u00b4 end, a hammerhead ribozyme and a T7 RNA polymerase transcription terminator at the 3\u00b4 end. The hammerhead ribozyme sequence was included to allow for correct cleavage of the 3\u00b4 end of the antigenome. The strategy for production of recombinant infectious virus from cDNA using these systems involved expression of antigenome, together with coexpression of the N, P and L (M2-1 was included for RSV and hMPV) proteins [44] . These proteins are necessary for the synthesis of antigenomic RNA from a genomic RNA template. Transfected cells are simultaneously infected with a modified vaccinia Ankara virus expressing the T7 RNA polymerase (MVA-T7). The MVA-T7 strain used is a host range-restricted mutant that replicates efficiently only in cells of avian origin; in mammalian cells there is a block at a late stage of virion maturation which significantly reduces yields of infectious virus [37] . Virus yields from these systems are low, although sufficient for the recovery of virus by further passage.",

Furthermore, because viral RNA replication and transcription occur in the nuclei of influenza virus-infected cells, in vitro generated vRNP transfected to cells must be transported to the nucleus. The development of methods for the rescue of influenza viruses from cloned cDNA has been refined over the past decade to the point where it is now possible to rescue influenza entirely from cloned cDNA [42, 43 ]. In the system reported by Neumann et al. [43] , cDNA from each of the eight genome segments was cloned in a negative orientation between the human RNA polymerase I promoter and mouse RNA polymerase I terminator. Transfection of all eight plasmids into a human-derived cell line (the 293T line) resulted in vRNA synthesis by cellular RNA polymerase I. If these eight RNA-producing plasmids, together with nine protein-expressing plasmids (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2 and NS2), are cotransfected in 293T cells, yields of > 10 7 plaque forming units (pfu)/ml of virus are produced within 48 h [43] . As helper virus is not required for the generation of recombinant virus, the cumbersome selection process described in earlier studies involving RNP was not necessary. Similar titres were also reported following transfection of the eight RNA-producing plasmids and four protein-expressing plasmids (PB2, PB1, PA and NP; Figure 2 ) [43] . A similar approach was taken by Fodor et al. [42] . They inserted cDNA copies of the eight genome segments between the human RNA polymerase I promoter and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme. These plasmids, together with nine proteinexpressing plasmids, were then transfected to Vero cells and yields of 10 -20 pfu/10 7 cells were obtained within 4 days.",

Viruses lacking the entire NS1 gene are susceptible to the interferon response [63] and have been shown to be highly attenuated for mice [64] .

The influenza A viruses used consist of reassortants of a high-yielding donor strain and current epidemic strains. Reassortants are usually prepared by coinfection of eggs with an egg-adapted preparation of a current epidemic strain and a donor strain. Progeny virus is screened for the presence of reassortants that contain the HA and NA of the epidemic strain and the internal genes of the high-yielding parent that specify high growth [68] . These procedures are time-consuming and unpredictable; coinfection of eggs with two different viruses could, in theory, generate 2 8 , or 256, different types of reassortant. Comprehensive screening procedures must be undertaken to select the desired reassortant for use as a vaccine seed, a process that takes 6 -8 weeks [69] . Timelines for vaccine preparation are generally tight and are primarily dependent on the number of embryonated eggs required for growth of the vaccine virus. Egg supplies must be anticipated many months in advance. Potential problems that interrupt their supply or problems with vaccine manufacture can have a major effect on the timeline for vaccine delivery [70] .",

[46] involved transfection of eight RNA expression plasmids containing the HA and NA genes from epidemic strains and four protein expression plasmids containing the PB2, PB1, PA and NP genes prepared from the H1N1 virus A/WSN/33. All plasmids were used to transfect co-cultures of the 293T and MDCK cell lines. Progeny viruses possessed the surface antigens of the epidemic strain and the internal genes of the donor (i.e., they were 6:2 constructs), and had similar growth properties to viruses prepared by conventional reassortment in eggs using the PR/8 donor strain. Hoffmann et al. [67] described a modified method for virus rescue that required transfection to 293T and MDCK co-cultures by only eight plasmids. All rescued viruses grew to high titre in embryonated eggs and had the surface antigens of the parental epidemic strains [67] . The main disadvantage in the above application of reverse genetics lies in the use of the 293T and MDCK cell lines. 293T is a transformed human cell line and there have been concerns about the suitability of the MDCK line, so it seems unlikely that either would be licensed for use as a substrate for the preparation of human vaccines. Moreover, human RNA polymerase I promoters can only be used in cells of human or primate origin [71] . Ozaki et al. [71] investigated the possibility of using cells of the Vero line for transfection. The Vero line is derived from kidney cells of the African green monkey and has been licensed in the preparation of several human virus vaccines, including those used for the prevention of poliomyelitis [72, 73] and rabies [74, 75] . Cells of the Vero line support the growth of influenza viruses in the presence of trypsin [74, 75] and have been used for the preparation of influenza vaccines [76] [77] [78] . These vaccines have been shown to elicit comparable antibody responses and higher cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses than those obtained from egg-grown vaccines [78] .",

            "text": "A reverse genetics approach to vaccine production has been considered essential in the event of a pandemic caused by a new human influenza virus. Human infections with avian influenza strains have been observed in 1997 (H5N1), 1999 (H9N2), 2003 (H5N1 and H7N7) and 2004 (H5N1 and H7N3). Of these influenza A subtypes, H5 and H7 viruses have been associated with highly pathogenic infections [79] . These highly pathogenic strains are lethal for chickens and chicken embryos [80] [81] [82] . Lethality has been associated with the presence of a multiple basic amino acid motif adjacent to the cleavage site of the HA glycoprotein. The presence of this motif increases the range of target organs that can support the growth of these viruses because they contain endogenous proteases [80] . Unless this cleavage site is removed, it would not be possible to grow vaccine viruses in embryonated eggs and alternative methods of cultivation that include cell culture would have to be used. In addition, the large-scale growth of unmodified viruses constitutes a potential public health problem. In an approach to produce suitable vaccine candidates against highly pathogenic influenza strains, Subbarao et al. [83] and Webby et al. [84] have produced viruses by reverse genetics, in which the multiple basic amino acid motif was removed from the 1997 Hong Kong and 2003 Asian viruses of the H5N1 subtype, respectively. These viruses were prepared with the modified HA and NA derived from the H5N1 avian strain and the internal genes from A/PR/8/34, and were replicated to high titre in embryonated eggs. Viruses containing deleted HAs were shown to be attenuated compared with the wild-type avian parent, which was lethal for chickens and mice [83] . Subbarao et al. [83] reported that vaccination of mice with a formalin-inactivated preparation of the mutant 1997 reassortant virus resulted in an immune response that was comparable to that of a formalin-inactivated preparation of the H5N1 avian parent [83] .",

The most promising of these strains, a cold-passaged RSV A2 strain, is the moderately attenuated strain cp-RSV. This strain was further mutated by two rounds of chemical mutagenesis to produce temperaturesensitive (ts) mutants. These strains were evaluated in both seropositive and seronegative children, and one, cpts-248/ 404, was shown to be sufficiently attenuated to undergo testing in RSV-negative infants 1 -2 months of age [19] . When tested in this group, 80% of vaccinated infants shed moderate levels of virus, developed significant rises in RSV-specific IgA and were highly resistant to re-infection with a second dose of vaccine virus given 1 month later [19] . However, one infant shed low amounts of vaccine virus with a partial loss of the ts phenotype and some loss of attenuation, indicating that the attenuating mutations were unstable.",

As a consequence, it is possible to define the genetic basis of attenuation for the existing cp-RSV and cpts-RSV mutants, and the generation of vaccine candidates with genetically defined mutations [93] . A further approach has been to produce mutants containing deletions of non-essential genes for the development of highly stable attenuation characteristics [93] . Five RSV genes, NS1, NS2, SH, G and M2-2, are regarded as almost non-essential, in that deletion or silencing of any of them has little effect on virus growth in culture [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] . Deletion of the G gene, one of the major neutralising antigens of RSV, would be unlikely to produce a suitable vaccine strain, as viruses lacking the G gene have been shown to be overattenuated for mice, with little virus replication occurring in the upper respiratory tract [97] . In addition, a cold-passaged RSV B virus, with a resulting deletion of most of the SH and G ORFs, was tested in primates and clinical trials and was found to be overattenuated in seronegative infants [103] .",

Reverse genetics systems allow the direct modification of the genome of negative-stranded RNA viruses. They provide a powerful means for studying virus replication and assembly by allowing the function(s) of viral proteins to be studied after modification or deletion of single or multiple genes. Future applications should provide much more information than is available at present on the role of individual genes in virulence and on the mechanisms of viral pathogenicity.",

For inactivated vaccines against influenza, reverse genetics could be used to more precisely identify specific sequences concerned with enhanced growth of a vaccine reassortant in eggs or cell culture, which could contribute significantly to the cost and availability of pandemic vaccines. However, because vaccines produced by reverse genetics are classified as GMOs in some countries, extensive safety testing will be required and much debate will ensue before they will be licensed for human use.",
