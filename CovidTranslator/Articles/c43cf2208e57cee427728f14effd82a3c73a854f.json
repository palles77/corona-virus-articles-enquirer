Changes in biodiversity can profoundly impact the ability of ecosystems to provide clean water, energy, food, recreation, and other services that contribute to human well-being. In addition, changes in biodiversity can affect the transmission of infectious disease to humans, particularly vectorborne diseases such as malaria and Lyme disease. The Environmental Protection Agency's new initiative supports interdisciplinary research to characterize the mechanisms that link biodiversity and human health and to use this knowledge to develop integrative tools and approaches for quantifying and predicting these relationships. Research on these links can have an important impact on our view of biodiversity and how we manage resources to protect human and ecosystem health.",

Conserving biodiversity, including genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity, is a primary means of sustaining these services, especially in response to changing conditions (Loreau, 2001; Millennium Ecosystem Assess-ment [MA], 2005a ). Yet our actions in the past 50 years have changed these systems to an unprecedented degree, altering habitats, reducing biodiversity, and putting ecosystem services at risk (MA, 2005a) . Estimated rates of species extinction are as much as a thousand times higher than average in the fossil record, levels that are unprecedented outside of mass extinction events (Pimm et al., 1995) . The net loss of populations and individuals may be several times greater than the rates of species loss (e.g., Hughes et al., 1997; Thomas et al., 2004) .",

The loss or extinction of large predators because of hunting and land-use change can increase the population of a particular vector or host. This loss can result in a greater prevalence of pathogens among hosts, and, consequently, pose an increased risk of transmission to humans (Dobson et al., 2006) . It has also been shown that the loss of specialist predators can affect the health of animal populations, as diseased individuals can survive longer and increase the potential for transmission (Packer et al., 2003) . Conversely, when nonnative species are introduced into a system, they can alter ecosystems, impact biodiversity, and change native host-parasite dynamics . Introduced pathogens and vectors can also cause high levels of mortality in wildlife and humans (van Riper and van Riper, 1986; Lounibos, 2002) .",

For example, eutrophication and overfishing can contribute to an abundance of intermediate snail hosts of schistosomiasis (Picquet et al., 1996; Madsen et al., 2001) . Other studies suggest that species and habitat diversity can reduce the transmission rates of vectorborne diseases. LoGuidice et al. (2003) developed empirically based models that suggest increasing rates of Borrelia burgdorferi tick infection, the pathogen associated with Lyme disease, as host biodiversity declines. In a Louisiana study, increased diversity of nonpasserine birds, which are less competent reservoir hosts compared to passerines, was associated with decreased West Nile virus infection in mosquitoes and humans (Ezenwa et al., 2006) . Another recent study of West Nile virus in the Baltimore-Washington, DC area showed that mosquito feeding preferences rather than the diversity of available hosts was the dominant factor in transmission patterns (Kilpatrick et al., 2006) .",
