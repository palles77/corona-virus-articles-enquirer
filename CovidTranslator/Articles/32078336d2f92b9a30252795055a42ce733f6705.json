These viruses could not be recognized by 1A4, a monoclonal antibody specific for the H protein of CDV vaccine strains. The complete haemagglutinin (H) genes of all 18 isolates were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis showed that they segregated into two clusters within the Asia-1 genotype. Moreover, the H genes of four viruses were found to lack a potential N-glycosylation site at position 309, which is the most conserved site within the Asia-1 genotype of CDV, and a novel potential N-glycosylation site",

            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae and causes an acuteto-subacute highly contagious disease in domestic dogs that presents a variety of clinical signs [1] . Domesticated dogs are the main reservoir of CDV, which is a host to several pathogens, such as canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV), and canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) [2] . The diseases associated with these pathogens have been controlled for many years using multiple live attenuated vaccines [1] . However, in many cases, vaccinated dogs, minks, foxes and raccoon dogs have recently been reported to show classical clinical signs of CDV infection [3, 4] . It remains unknown whether it is due to vaccination failure or the ability of new virulent CDV strains to escape vaccine-induced immunity. In addition, there have been reports of antigenic differences between vaccine strains and field strains [5, 6] . The haemagglutinin (H) protein, which is a structural protein of the virion, is a major target of the immune system and plays a key role as a virus ligand in mediating attachment to cellular receptors and entry into host cells. The H gene shows great genetic variability and is often used for investigating the relatedness of CDV isolates and for molecular epidemiological studies [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

By contrast, the isolation rate of CDV in Vero/DogSLAM cells inoculated with lung homogenate supernatants in this study was 100% (16/16). Therefore, in addition to expression of the SLAM receptor for CDV and the defect in IFN-\u03b2 production in the parental Vero cells [10] , selection of appropriate clinical specimens (such as lung samples) may contribute to a higher rate of isolation of CDV. Six of the lung samples (HL006,HL009,HNly15 0403,HL010,HL011,HL012) were found to be coinfected with CPIV or/and CAV-2 (Supplementary Table 2 ). Vero cells were inoculated with these samples, and the other two viruses were isolated using at least 10 blind passages. Only one strain of CPIV (HeN0718) was successfully isolated after eight blind passages before obvious CPE appeared [11] . Thus, for all of the lung samples tested on Vero/Dog SLAM cells, the formation of large syncytia was caused by CDV rather than the other viruses.",

The isolation of new virulent CDV strains from these vaccinated dogs indicates that the commercial vaccines did not confer full protection. Recently, a research group in Japan reported that eight CDV field strains could not be completely neutralized by anti-CDV (vaccine strain, Onderstepoort) canine plasma [3] . To investigate if the current Chinese CDV field strains could escape vaccine-induced immunity, two well-defined CDV monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were used. The mAb 1A4 recognizes the H proteins of vaccine strains such as Onderstepoort and Snyder Hill, but not those of field CDV strains, and 1G5 recognizes the F proteins of both vaccine and field strains of CDV [12] . As shown in Fig.1 , none of the field strains of CDV isolated in this study were recognized by mAb 1A4, as demonstrated by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). By contrast, the strains HL001, HL008, HL010 and Onderstepoort were detected by 1G5 mAb, as indicated by brown staining in the IPMA (Fig. 1) . The other 15 Chinese field strains isolated in this study also reacted with 1G5 (not shown). These results are consistent with those of a previous study [3] . ?? Mori et al.? ? showed that eight field isolates of CDV from dogs in Japan were also not recognized and neutralized by an anti-CDV-H antibody (d-7) that showed neutralizing activity against a vaccine strain and laboratory-adapted strains [3] . These results indicated that the new circulating CDV strains have lost or do not expose some epitopes that are present or exposed in the vaccine strains and thus escape binding by MAb 1A4 or d-7.",

The H protein sequences of the 18 CDV field strains described in this study were aligned with those of other Asia-1 strains ( [4, 6, 13, 14] , and a novel potential N-glycosylation site (amino acids 517-519) was found in strain HL013, which has not been reported previously ( Table 1 ). The number of N-glycosylation sites in the H protein has been associated with the virulence of CDV [15] . The presence of a potential N-glycosylation site (amino acids 517-519) in strain HL003 might affect the virulence. Furthermore, it has been suggested that extensive masking of antigenic epitopes by sugar moieties could prevent neutralizing antibodies from binding the H protein [16] . By contrast, a potential N-glycosylation site (amino acids 309-311) that is unique to field strains [13] was lacking in the H protein of four CDV field strains (HL005, HL008, HL010 and HNly150326) ( Table 1 ).

The strain type 519R/549Y of the CDV H gene is typical of dog strains worldwide, and highest performance has been observed in cells expressing dog SLAM receptors [20] . With the exception of HL013, the isolates from this study encoded 519 R/549 Y. CDV strains with histidine at position 549 have been shown to be highly virulent for raccoons [17] .
