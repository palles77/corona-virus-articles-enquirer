Berg's gene-splicing experiment resulted in the insertion of the restriction enzyme into virus-infected cells.

Because of the perceived risks, Berg postponed his research and, to begin the process of evaluating the potential hazards, he organized a conference to discuss biohazards in biological research in January 1973 at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, California. This was the first conference that focused on laboratory safety and design to protect laboratorians handling rDNA. Following this meeting, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Institute of Medicine (NIM) were asked to appoint a committee to study this new technology. Subsequently, a Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) was set up by the NIH at the request of the scientific community to review recombinant experiments [2] .",

Approximately 150 of the leaders in this emerging field debated the risks of cloning, manipulating foreign genes and their expression in bacteria. At the end of this meeting, a series of resolutions that set forth guidelines for physical and biological containment procedures was given to the newly established NIH RAC. RAC became the governing body for the implementation of the guidelines. The public participated in the design of the guidelines through open hearings, and the guidelines were given strength by linking compliance with federal funds for any such research.

If the institution conducts plant or animal research, experts specializing in this field must be represented on the committee. If the institution produces large-scale recombinant research material (>10 L) or works at high containment levels (such as biosafety level 3 or 4), a Biological Safety Officer (BSO) must be appointed and serve on the IBC. The role of the BSO is to develop emergency plans for handling accidental spills and personnel contamination with recombinant or synthetic DNA, and they must report any recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid problems, violations, and research-related injuries or illnesses to the IBC. In addition, the BSO advises on security and offers technical advice to the Principal Investigators and IBC on safety procedures. The committee must have expertise in biological safety, containment, risk assessment, applicable law, and knowledge of institutional policies.

Community members are usually representatives from local public health or environmental authorities, and are frequently members with laboratory, medical, occupational, or environmental experience. The community members represent the concerns of the local population. When experiments contain topics that fall outside the knowledge of the IBC committee, it is appropriate to seek ad hoc members with appropriate additional expertise. IBCs are required to register with the OBA and file an annual online update. The update must identify the Chairman and contain contact information and biographical sketches for all members.

Some IBC oversight also includes reviewing policies and procedures and facility review for containment. With the new personnel suitability requirements of the Federal Select Agent Program (SAP), some institutions working with select agents are now requiring their IBCs to review biosecurity and personnel suitability plans before institutions adopt them. The increase in regulatory burden has significantly increased the workload for this committee of volunteers. Research projects involving recombinant and synthetic nucleic acid molecules at institutions have increased significantly in the last 15 or so years. The budget for the NIH has more than doubled from $13.7 billion in 1998 to $31.3 billion in 2014. Due to world events, IBCs have had to expand their oversight responsibilities to include biodefense and emerging infectious disease research review. New technological capabilities are also of concern to IBCs, such as the genomic synthesis of viruses (e.g., polio), reconstructing organisms (e.g., the 1918 pandemic influenza strain), and novel gene therapy protocols [8] . The ease of rDNA techniques and access to necessary materials (along with the ability to purchase genetics elements off the internet) has increased the need for tighter oversight and restrictions on the publication of life science research.",

These experiments are referred to as \"gain-of-function\" research because the experiments alter the pathogens in ways that give them features or functions not found in nature or in the wild. Both groups genetically modified highly pathogenic, avian influenza H5N1 viruses, some through re-assortment with the H1N1 (swine) influenza virus (Kawaoka experiment), directed mutation (Fouchier), and virus passage experiments (Fouchier). The resulting viral mutants could be transmitted via aerosol among ferrets, a model for influenza transmission in human beings [25] . The submission of these two manuscripts to the scientific journals Nature and Science caused pandemonium in the scientific community and resulted in an unprecedented recommendation from NSABB to suspend the publication of the research. In the United States, NSABB requested the methods used to enable transmission of the H5N1 virus from mammal to mammal and the results of the experiment be redacted before the articles were released to the public. NSABB feared that the exact details of the scientific methods used and the mutations involved could pose a significant biosafety risk. In the Netherlands, the Dutch government delayed the release of the paper by Dr Fouchier as authorities believed the work may have violated export control rules, related to dual use, and government-regulated technology [26] . The NSABB also recommended a 60-day moratorium on all similar research while the potential risks were assessed. Leading influenza scientists around the world agreed to the moratorium. The World Health Organization (WHO) did not agree with the recommendation of NSABB to redact information in the articles before publication. They believed that widely sharing the results of the articles would provide significant public health and scientific value [27] ; however, the WHO did agree to the moratorium until the risks could be further evaluated [28] .",

As a result, many biosafety, scientific, and government groups are demanding accountability from the scientific community. Determining the level of regulation that meets the needs of the majority of stakeholders is a balancing act that will require ongoing and open negotiation among all interested parties [30] .

When the policy was promulgated in 2012, roles and responsibilities were not well defined by the USG in the document. It was assumed by many that the IBC would take the lead on the issues as they relate to DURC research because the committee has recognized knowledge of the research being conducted by investigators and because of its members' many years of experience evaluating research involving rDNA, performing risk assessments, and assigning bio-containment levels. Of particular significance, 2014 policy reassigns the burden back to the Principal Investigator to initially identify their project as DURC. Further, the institution is required to establish an Institutional Review Entity (IRE). The IRE can be a committee established to review dual use research, an extant committee such as an IBC with the addition of ad hoc members to meet the established requirements of the committee, or an externally administered committee to review dual use research [31] . The IRE must be set up for the sole purpose of conducting review of research for dual use potential. The IRE must meet several criteria including that the group must be composed of at least five members and empowered by the institution to ensure it can execute the relevant requirements of the Policy for DURC Oversight. The members must have knowledge to assess the dual use potential of the range of relevant life science research conducted at a research facility. In addition, the committee must have individuals with knowledge of relevant US Government policies and understanding of risk assessment. The panel must also be conversant in risk management, biosafety, and biosecurity. The IRE is responsible for communications with the US Government funding agencies regarding mitigation plans and will have ongoing oversight of the project [31] . Not surprisingly, the requirements for the IRE align with the established mandates for an IBC. In most circumstances and at the majority of establishments, the IBC is the logical choice for the review and oversight of DURC at the institutional level. However, putting the burden of DURC review on the IBC increases the workload and regulatory burden on an already overtaxed committee that is not compensated for their time and effort. Some institutions may decide to set up a new committee or if they do not have in-house expertise on their IBC they may be forced to use an externally administered committee, such as an IBC, for the purpose of reviewing DURC protocols.",

When the NIH Guidelines were initially published, they were the only guidance in place for the oversight of rDNA technology. The development of the Guidelines was a direct result of the Asilomar Conference in 1975 where researchers and the public discussed their trepidation of this new emerging science. At that time, local IBCs were established at institutions receiving funds from the NIH for research involving rDNA. The IBC was originally tasked with reviewing rDNA protocols using the strict guidelines instigated at the Asilomar Conference. As research evolved in the human subject's field with recombinant gene therapy research, more IBC oversight was needed. Therefore, the IBC was tasked with reviewing human gene protocols for biosafety concerns and containment along with evaluation and mitigation of SAEs from human gene protocols. Currently, no human participant can be enrolled in a study without RAC, IBC, and IRB approval.",

Before 1996 there was no oversight of BSAT. After 9/11, and the subsequent anthrax attacks, the threat of bioterrorism changed the landscape of regulations governing life science research. Post 9/11 in 2001, the US PATRIOT Act was passed to strengthen the BSAT program. When this regulation was passed, it required more oversight on the part of the BSO and IBC to review research rDNA protocols, SOPs, incidents and accidents, security and personnel reliability plans, and other documents to support the BSAT program.",

After discussing the book, IBCs around the country recognized that the federal oversight of life science research was changing in order to protect national security and public health. One of the recommendations from the 2004 book that came to fruition was the establishment of the NSABB within the Department of Health and Human Services to educate scientists and advise the government on the oversight of \"dual use of concern research.\" As a direct result of the 2011 gain of function H5N1 influenza experiments by Fouchier and Kawaoka, the Federal Government published the US Policy for the Oversight of Life Science Dual Use Research of Concern in March 2012. Although the roles and responsibilities were not established in this first policy, it was widely accepted that IBCs would take on the responsibility of this new regulation. In preparation of what was to come, many IBCs implemented new institutional practices at this time to support the emerging regulations.",

This balancing act was recently demonstrated in October 2014 by the Federal Government as it imposed a moratorium on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza gain-of-function research projects pending further review. This moratorium followed biosafety lapses at the CDC in regards to anthrax exposure to 70 employees and the unexpected discovery of 16 vials of forgotten variola virus in a storage closet at the FDA's Bethesda campus during a routine inventory. It is evident by the actions of the Federal Government that regulations and oversight guidance for life science research will continue to evolve and be further expanded as science and technology advance in the future (and, as will doubtless be the case, when new mishaps occur, even without injury or risk to humans, animals, or the environment).",
