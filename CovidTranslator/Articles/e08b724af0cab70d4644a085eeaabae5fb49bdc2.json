However, most of these vaccine candidates may also induce immunopathology or other harmful immune responses [7, 8] , raising concerns about their safety. On the other hand, recombinant proteins containing the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV S protein could be developed as a safe and effective SARS vaccine. This potential is based on the ability of receptor binding domain-based vaccine to induce stronger crossneutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV [9] , with a correspondingly lower probability of inducing immunopathology, in contrast with the other SARS vaccine candidates mentioned previously [6] .",
