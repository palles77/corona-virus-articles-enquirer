To test the role of IFITM3 in human influenza virus infection, we assessed the IFITM3 alleles of individuals hospitalised with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. We find that a statistically significant number of hospitalised subjects show enrichment for a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) that alters a splice acceptor site, and functional assays show the minor CC genotype IFITM3 has reduced influenza virus restriction in vitro. Together these data reveal that the action of a single intrinsic immune effector, IFITM3, profoundly alters the course of influenza virus infection in mouse and man.",

However, the role of the Ifitm proteins in anti-viral immunity in vivo is unknown. Therefore, we infected mice that are homozygous for a disruptive insertion in exon 1 of the Ifitm3 gene that abolishes its expression 8 (Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 ), with a low-pathogenicity (LP) murine-adapted H3N2 influenza A virus (A/X-31). LP strains of influenza do not normally cause extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, or cause the cytokine dysregulation and death typically seen after infection with highly-pathogenic (HP) viral strains 9 , at the doses used (Fig. 1a) . However, LP-infected Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice became moribund, losing >25% of their original body weight and exhibiting severe signs of clinical illness (rapid breathing, piloerection) 6 days after infection. In comparison, wild-type (WT) litter mates shed <20% of their original body weight, before fully recovering (Fig. 1a, b) . There was little difference in virus replication in the lungs during the first 48 hours of infection. However, virus persisted and was not cleared as quickly in Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, whose lungs contained 10-fold higher levels of replicating virus than the WT mice at 6 days post-infection (Fig. 1c) . No viral RNA was detected in the heart, brain or spleen of infected WT or Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice over the course of infection, revealing that systemic viremia was not occurring. Full genome sequencing of virus removed from the lungs of WT and Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed no genetic variation. We demonstrated that Ifitm3 protein expression after influenza infection was absent in Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice but increased substantially in WT controls (Fig. 1b, Supp. Fig. S1 ). Infection of WT and Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice with a human isolate of pandemic influenza A H1N1 (pH1N1/09) resulted in the same severe pathogenicity phenotype in the Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1a, b) .",

Importantly, the stable restoration of Ifitm3 conferred WT levels of restriction against either X-31, or the more pathogenic Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR/8) influenza strain (Fig. 1d, Supp. Fig. S2 ). Further to IFITM3's role in restriction of HP H5N1 avian influenza 7 , we also show that it limits infection by recent human influenza A isolates and influenza B virus (Supp. Fig. S3 ). Therefore, enhanced pathogenesis to diverse influenza viruses is attributable to loss of Ifitm3 expression and consequential changes in immune defence of the lungs.",

Lung pathology was characterised by extensive oedema and red blood cell extravasation, as well as pneumonia, hemorrhagic pleural effusion and multiple, large lesions on all lung lobes (Fig. 2a, b, Supp. Fig. S4 ). We note this pathology is similar to that produced by infection of mice and primates with 1918 H1N1 virus [9] [10] [11] . Given the higher viral load in Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice and increased replication of influenza A virus in Ifitm3 deleted cells in vitro (Fig. 1d) , we examined both viral nucleic acid and protein distribution in the lung. Influenza virus infection penetrated deeper into the lung tissue in Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice whose infection was primarily restricted to the bronchioles, with minimal alveolar infection. Influenza virus was detected throughout the entire lung in Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 sections, spreading extensively in both bronchioles and alveoli ( Fig. 2c) . Histopathology showed marked infiltration of cells and debris into the Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts bronchoalveolar space of Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2b, Supp. Fig. S4b ). The extent and mechanism of cell damage was investigated by TUNEL assay, showing widespread cellular apoptosis occurring 6 days post-infection in Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, whereas apoptosis in WT lungs was very limited (Supp. Fig. S4c ). Together, the Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mouse pathology is consistent with infection by HP strains of influenza A virus, where widespread apoptosis occurs by day 6 post-infection, whilst lungs from LP infections were similar to those of WT mice, displaying minimal damage 9, 12, 13 .",

NS1 is the primary influenza virus interferon antagonist, with multiple inhibitory effects on host immune pathways 20, 21 . We found that delNS1 virus was attenuated in both WT and Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, whilst the isogenic PR/8 strain expressing NS1 exhibited typical high pathogenicity in all mice tested, lower doses of PR/8 influenza (whilst lethal in both genotypes of mice) caused accelerated weight loss in Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice (Supp. Fig. S8 ). As delNS1 influenza A virus retains its pathogenicity in IFN-deficient mice 19 , this suggests that Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice can mount an adequate IFN-mediated anti-viral response without extensive morbidity. Therefore, unchecked lung viral replication and an enhanced inflammatory response accounts for the profoundly deleterious effects of viral infection in Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Using tests sensitive to recent positive selection, we can find evidence for positive selection on the IFITM3 locus in human populations acting over the last tens of thousands of years in Africa (Fig. 4b, c) . We therefore sequenced 1.8kb of the IFITM3 locus encompassing the exons, intron and untranslated regions from 53 individuals who required admission to hospital as a result of pandemic H1N1/09 or seasonal influenza virus infection in 2009-2010. Of these, 86.8% of patients carried majority alleles for all 28 SNPs in the coding sequence of the gene, but 13.2% possessed known variants. In particular, we discovered over-representation in cases of the synonymous SNP rs12252, wherein the majority T allele is substituted for a minority C allele, which alters the first splice acceptor site and may be associated with the IFITM3 splice variant (ENST00000526811), which encodes an IFITM3 protein lacking the first 21 amino acids due to the use of an alternative start codon.",

We next challenged the LCLs with influenza A virus and found that the minority (CC) variant was more susceptible to infection, and this vulnerability correlated with lower levels of IFITM3 protein expression as compared to the majority (TT) variant cells (Supp. Fig. S10 ). Although we did not detect the IFITM3 splice variant protein (ENST00000526811) in the CC LCLs, we nonetheless investigated the possible significance of its presence by stably expressing the N-terminally truncated (N\u039421) and WT proteins to equivalent levels in human A549 lung carcinoma cell lines before infection with influenza A virus (A/WSN/1933 (WSN/33)). We found that cells expressing the N\u039421 protein failed to restrict viral replication when compared to WT IFITM3 ( We show here that Ifitm3 expression acts as an essential barrier to influenza A virus infection in vivo and in vitro. The fulminant viral pneumonia that occurs in the absence of Ifitm3 arises because of uncontrolled virus replication in the lungs, resulting in profound morbidity. In effect, the host's loss of a single immune effector, Ifitm3, transforms a mild infection into one with remarkable severity. Similarly, the enrichment of the rs12252 Callele in those hospitalised with influenza infections, together with the decreased IFITM3 levels and the increased infection of the CC-allele cells in vitro, suggests that IFITM3 also plays a pivotal role in defence against human influenza virus infections. This innate resistance factor is all the more important during encounters with a novel pandemic virus, when the host's acquired immune defences are less effective. Indeed, IFITM3-compromised individuals, and in turn populations with a higher percentage of such individuals, may be more vulnerable to the initial establishment and spread of a virus against which they lack adaptive immunity. In light of its ability to curtail the replication of a broad range of pathogenic viruses in vitro, these in vivo results suggest that IFITM3 may also shape the clinical course of additional viral infections in favour of the host, and may have done so over human evolutionary history.",

The 1.8kb IFITM3 band was gel extracted and purified using the QiaQuick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). IFITM3 was Sanger sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3730\u00d7l DNA Analyzer (GATC Biotech) using a combination of eight sequencing primers (Supp . Table  S4 ). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified by assembly to the human IFITM3 encoding reference sequence (Acc. No.: NC_000011.9) using Lasergene (DNAStar). Homozygotes were called based on high, single base peaks with high Phred quality scores, whilst heterozygotes were identified based on low, overlapping peaks of two bases with lower Phred quality scores relative to surrounding base calls (Supp. Fig. S9 ). We identified SNP rs12252 in our sequencing and compared the allele and genotype frequencies to allele and genotype frequencies from 1000 Genomes sequencing data from different populations (Supp . Table S3 ). In addition, we used the most recent release of phased 1000 Genomes data 27 to impute the region surrounding SNP rs12252 to determine allele frequencies in the publicly available genotype dataset of WTCCC1 controls (n=2,938) and four previously published datasets genotyped from the Netherlands (n=8,892) and Germany (n=6,253) 22 . In the imputation, samples genotyped with Illumina 550k, 610k and 670k platforms were imputed against the June 2011 release of 1000 Genotypes phased haplotypes using the Impute software 28 We assessed for population stratification by principal component analysis. Genotype data from the WTCCC1 1958 Birth Cohort dataset were obtained from the European Genotype Archive with permission, reformatted and merged with genotype data from the GenISIS study to match 113,819 SNPs present in both cohorts. Suspected strand mismatches were removed by identifying SNPs with more than 2 genotypes and using the LD method as implemented in Plink (v1.07) 29 , resulting in 105,362 matched SNPs. Quality control was applied in GenABEL version 1.6-9 to genotype data for these SNPs for the GenISIS cases and 1499 individuals from WTCCC. Thresholds for quality control (deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p<0.05), MAF<0.0005, call rate<98% in all samples) were applied iteratively to identify all markers and subjects passing all quality control criteria, followed by principal component analysis using GenABEL. We tested for positive selection using both a haplotype-based test (|XP-EHH-max|) and allele frequency spectrum-based test statistics, namely Tajima's D, Fay and Wu's H and Nielsen et al.'s CLR on 10 kb windows across the entire genome as described previously 27, 30 . The three statistics were combined and the combined p value was plotted corresponding to the 10 kb windows.",

MEFs were cultured in DMEM, containing 10% FBS, 1X MEM essential amino acids, 1X 2-Mercapto-ethanol (Gibco). MEFs were transduced with VSV-G pseudotyped retroviruses expressing either the empty vector control (pQXCIP, Clontech), or one expressing Ifitm3, as previous described1 .After puromycin selection the respective cell lines were challenged with either A/X-31 virus (moi 0.3-0.4) or PR/8 (moi 0.4). For PR/8 infections, after 12h the media was removed and the cells were then fixed with 4% formalin and stained with purified anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Hybridoma HA36-4-5.2, Wistar Institute). For A/X-31 experiments, cells were processed comparably as above, but in addition were permeabilized, followed by immunostaining for NP expression (NP (clone H16-L10-4R5) mouse monoclonal (Millipore MAB8800)). Both sets of experiments were completed using an Alexa Fluor 488 goat antimouse secondary at 1:1,000 (A11001, Invitrogen). The cells were imaged on an automated Image Express Micro microscope (Molecular Devices), and images were analysed using the Metamorph Cell Scoring software program (Molecular Devices Inc.). Cytokines: Cells were incubated with cytokines for 24 h prior to viral infection. Murine interferon \u03b1 (PBL Interferon Source, Cat # 12100-1) and IFN-\u03b3 (PBL Interferon Source, Cat # 12500-2) were used at 500-2500 U/ml., and 100-300 ng/ml respectively.A549 transduction and infectivity assaysA549 cells (ATCC Cat#CCL-185) were grown in complete media (DMEM (Invitrogen Cat#11965) with 10% FBS (Invitrogen)). A549 stable cell lines were made by gammaretroviral transduction using either the empty vector control virus (pQXCIP, Clontech), the full-length human IFITM3 cDNA, or a truncated human IFITM3 cDNA which is missing the first 21 amino acids (N\u039421). After puromycin selection, expression of the IFITM3 and N\u039421 proteins were confirmed by Western blotting using an 18% SDS-PAGE gel and an anti-IFITM3 antibody that was raised against the conserved intracellular loop (CIL) of IFITM3 (Proteintech). A549 cell lines were challenged with one of the following strains:A/ WSN/33 (a kind gift of Dr. Peter Palese), A/California/7/2009, A/Uruguay/716/2007 and B/ Brisbane/60/2008 (kind gift of Dr. Jan Malbry, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA) for 12h, then fixed with 4% PFA and immunostained with anti-HA antibody (HA (Wistar collection) or anti-NP antibodies (Abcam), or Millipore clone H16-L10-4R5 anti-influenza A virus antibody). Percent infection was calculated from immunofluorescent images as described for the MEF experiments above. Alternatively, cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) or IFITM3 and were stained with anti-NP antibody (Abcam) and analysed by flow cytometry following challenge with B/Bangladesh/ 3333/2007 virus (NIMR, England). For the immunofluorescence-based viral titering experiments, virus-containing supernatant was collected from the indicated A549 cell line cultures after 12h of infection with WSN/33 (Part One). Next this supernatant was used toinfect MDCK cells (ATCC) in a well by well manner (Part Two). Both the A549 and MDCK cells were then processed to detect viral HA expression as described above.LCL infectivity assaysLCL TT and LCL CC cells were grown in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% FCS, 2mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 1\u00d7 MEM non-essential amino acids solution, and 20mM HEPES (all from Invitrogen). For infectivity assays, LCL cells were either treated with recombinant human IFN-\u03b12 (PBL Interferon Source, #11100) at 100 units/ml or DPBS (Sigma-Aldrich) for 16h. The LCL cells were then counted, resuspended at a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml, and plated on a 96-well round-bottom plate (200\u03bcl cell suspension/well). The cells were then challenged with WSN/33 influenza A virus (MOI 0.1). After 18h, the cells were washed twice with 250\u03bcl MACS buffer (DPBS containing 2% FCS and 2mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich)). The cells were fixed and permeabilised using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilisation Kit (BD Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were resuspended in 100\u03bcl of Cytofix/ Cytoperm Fixation and Permeabilisation solution and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 minutes. The cells were then washed twice with 250\u03bcl 1\u00d7 Perm/Wash buffer and resuspended in 50ml 1\u00d7 Perm/Wash buffer containing a 2 \u03bcg/ml solution of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody against influenza A virus NP (clone 431, Abcam, #ab20921). The cells were incubated in the diluted antibody solution for 1h at 4\u00b0C, washed twice with 250\u03bcl 1\u00d7 Perm/Wash buffer, resuspended in 200\u03bcl MACS buffer, and analysed by flow cytometry using a BD FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences).",

One such SNP, rs12252 (red) (a), encodes a splice acceptor site altering T/C substitution mutation, which results in a truncated protein with an N-terminal 21 amino acid deletion. Therefore two transcripts are predicted to be expressed from the IFITM3 gene. Positive selection analysis using a haplotype-based test (|XP-EHH-max|, b) where data points above 2.7 in the YRI (red), 3.9 in the CEU (blue) and 5.0 in the CHB+JPT (green) are in the top 1% of values and using a combination of three allele frequency spectrum-based test statistics (c), namely Tajima's D, Fay and Wu's H and Nielsen et al.'s CLR on 10 kb windows along chromosome 11 encompassing the IFITM3 locus. Evidence for positive selection is seen only in the YRI. Mutations recorded through sequencing of patients hospitalised with influenza virus during the H1N1/09 pandemic showed an overrepresentation of individuals with the C allele at SNP rs12252 (d), relative to matched Europeans. A549 cells transduced to express either full-length (IFITM3) or truncated (N\u039421) IFITM3 (e) (cell nuclei: blue, virus: green, 4\u00d7 magnification), show a reduction in viral restriction when IFITM3's N-terminal 21 amino acids are removed, relative to vector controls (Vector).
