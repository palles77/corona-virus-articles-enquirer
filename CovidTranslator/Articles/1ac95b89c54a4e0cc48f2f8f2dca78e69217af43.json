Three typical spatial information parameters including working unit/address, onset location and reporting unit were selected and SARS epidemic spread in-out flow in Beijing was defined based on the SARS epidemiological investigation data in China from 2002 to 2003 while its epidemiological characteristics were discussed. Furthermore, by the methods of spatial-temporal statistical analysis and network characteristic analysis, spatial-temporal high-risk hotspots and network structure characteristics of Beijing outer in-out flow were explored, and spatial autocorrelation/heterogeneity, spatial-temporal evolutive rules and structure characteristics of the spread network of Beijing inner in-out flow were comprehensively analyzed. The results show that (1) The outer input flow of SARS epidemic in Beijing concentrated on Shanxi and Guangdong provinces, but the outer output flow was disperse and mainly includes several north provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong. And the control measurement should focus on the early and interim progress of SARS breakout. (2) The inner output cases had significant positive autocorrelative characteristics in the whole studied region, and the high-risk population was young and middle-aged people with ages from 20 to 60 and occupations of medicine and civilian labourer. (3) The downtown districts were main high-risk hotspots of SARS epidemic in Beijing, the northwest suburban districts/counties were secondary high-risk hotspots, and northeast suburban areas were relatively safe. (4) The district/county nodes in inner spread network showed small-world characteristics and information/material flow had notable heterogeneity. The suburban Tongzhou and Changping districts were the underlying high-risk regions, and several suburban districts such as Shunyi and Huairou were the relatively low-risk safe regions as they carried out minority information/material flow. The exploration and analysis based on epidemic spread in-out flow help better detect and discover the potential spatial-temporal evolutive rules and characteristics of SARS epidemic, and provide a more effective theoretical basis for emergency/control measurements and decision-making.",

            "text": "Various complicated infectious diseases come along with human evolution, and mankind has repeatedly confronted extremely serious threat of known or unknown infectious diseases in human development history. Recent serious epidemic outbreaks with worldwide impact include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) during the spring of 2003 and influenza A H1N1 with worldwide spread in April 2009. SARS is a novel respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus infection, which has main symptoms of fever, dry cough, chest tight, respiratory failure, etc, and has an extremely strong infectious capacity with the paths including close droplet transmission, contact with respiratory secretions, and close spatial contact with infected cases. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Health of China, the count of provinces with SARS epidemic was 26 in mainland China, and there were significant regional differences in the distribution of number of SARS cases based on the situation of daily epidemic outbreak and cumulative count of suspected and confirmed cases. The suspected and confirmed SARS cases were concentrated in Beijing, Guangdong, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, Hebei, etc., and Beijing and Guangdong were the most important clustering hotspot centers of SARS epidemic. The first SARS cases of most provinces were students, migrant workers, business travelers, and tourists from Guangdong, Beijing and Hong Kong. SARS epidemic was the first worldwide popular event of public health in the 21st century, and researchers have comprehensively and thoroughly studied the virus characteristics, transmission mechanism, spatial-temporal distribution, prevention and control measures of SARS epidemic according to the theories and methods of pathology, epidemiology, medical statistics, spatial information science, etc., The spread process of SARS epidemic was caused by the collaborative effect of novel infectious virus, resources, environment, society, economy and other complex factors, and the quantitative studies of spatial-temporal patterns of SARS epidemic help thoroughly recognize the potential spread mechanism in the spatial-temporal scale, explain the driving effects of various factors in SARS epidemic, evaluate the infectious risk of regions and populations, provide theoretical supports for the emergency measures of prevention and control in SARS epidemic, and provide scientific basis for the researches of other unknown novel infectious diseases.",

(2) Mathematical statistical analysis of epidemiological data, such as quantitative analysis for temporal individual cases, close contacts and control measures using classical mathematical statistical methods [6, 7] . (3) Spatial-temporal statistical analysis of SARS epidemic characteristics, including exploring the distribution patterns of SARS cases in spatial-temporal scales [8] , analyzing the spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity characteristics of SARS epidemic using spatial-temporal statistical methods [9] [10] [11] , and exploring the spatial pattern, temporal process, and driving factors of SARS epidemic using meta models combining multiple spatial-temporal statistical methods [12] . (4) simulation and prediction of SARS epidemic process based on network dynamic models, such as simulating and analyzing the SARS epidemic process using system dynamics and multi-agent system [13, 14] , and simulating the spread mechanisms based on models of small-world network and scale-free network [15, 16] . (5) Quantitative analysis and evaluation of SARS epidemic influencing factors such as close contact, demographic distribution, socioeconomic situation, etc. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . According to the research scale, the first three kinds of researches focus on the statistical epidemic characteristics and results based on macroscopic studies, the fourth kind of research studies the spread pattern of microcosmic individuals and regions and its corresponding reflecting spread results in macroscopic region, and the last kind of research studies the driving effectiveness of impact factors to SARS epidemic based on macroscopic studies.",

(2) The epidemic data mainly include the confirmed infected cases and close contacts, and the analysis rarely focuses on the spatial-temporal changes of individuals during the process of susceptible-infected-symptomatic-treated-recovered. (3) The virus transmission mechanism between individuals and the interactive epidemic spread mode between regions will form a dynamic and directional network in the process of SARS epidemic, and the existed researches lack a quantitative analysis of SARS transmission network and explanation of its structural characteristics. Additionally, Beijing municipality was the most seriously affected region during SARS epidemic in mainland China, and its emergency measures of prevention and control were opportune and effective. Furthermore, Beijing as the capital of China has frequent interactions with other provinces and the rest of the world. Hence, it has remarkable demonstration effects and practical significance to take Beijing as the study area of analyzing the spatial-temporal patterns of SARS epidemic.",

The number of selected cases with those three sets of spatial information had proportions of 15.88%, 35.87% and 34.09% respectively. Figure 1 shows the temporal changes of individual number with three sets of spatial information. Obviously, SARS individual number corresponding to the three sets of spatial information had similar changing trend, which had stable growth phase in early March, rapid growth to a peak value in mid to late April, and rapid decline to fadeaway in mid to late May. The changing trend of individual number corresponding to onset location and reporting unit was extremely consistent, which indicates the consistency of onset and treatment locations of infected cases during the process of SARS epidemic in Beijing. However, the trend of individual number corresponding to working unit/home address had some differences, which indicate that some individuals that were infected in Beijing had onset or treatment locations in other regions, and there were scattered new cases in early process of SARS epidemic.",

For infected individuals, the main residence place transforms to infected location after getting infected, and transforms to onset location when the symptoms appear, and finally transforms to reporting unit where individuals receive treatment.

From this point of view, outer input cases of Beijing were mainly from Guangdong (121 cases) and several provinces around Beijing including Hebei (52 cases), Shandong (69 cases), Shanxi (70 cases), Henan (68 cases) and etc, and the distribution of input cases from other provinces in central China were even more, whereas those from northeastern and northwestern provinces were relatively rare. Outer output cases of Beijing were more concentrated in Guangdong (90 cases), followed by Hebei (36 cases), Shanxi (32 cases), and Inner Mongolia (17 cases), whereas there were only sporadic cases in other provinces (less than 10). From the temporal changes of the various types of cases shown in Figure 3 (b), outer input cases began to appear from early March, broke out in early April, continued increasing until late April when reaching the peak of daily increasing number of input cases, and then the cases began to decline until disappearing; the developing trend of self spread cases was consistent with that of outer input cases, indicating that the contributions of outer input cases and inner self spread cases were essentially identical to SARS epidemic of Beijing, and the number of inner cases plummeted for a short term in late April probably because isolation measures had a significant effect on controlling the spread of virus at the outset. Outer output cases appeared earlier with stable trend all the time, and even during the severe epidemic in April the number of daily increasing cases remained at about 10. Some conclusions could be drawn based on the above analysis: (1) SARS epidemic in Beijing was composed mainly of outer input cases and inner self spread cases, and the former was mainly from Guangdong and the provinces around Beijing; (2) outer output cases were fewer as a whole, and most concentrated in Guangdong, Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia; (3) ratios of outer secondary input and output cases were 1.17% and 19.4% respectively, indicating that outer input cases mostly got infected and received treatment in Beijing, and although the overall number of output cases was fewer than that of input cases, the output cases contributed higher risk of infection because some cases had location transformation during the process of getting infected and receiving treatment; and (4) prevention and control measures were certainly effective for inner self spread cases, but required more massive strengthening for controlling outer input and output cases. Characteristics of attributes including gender, age and occupation of outer input and output cases of SARS epidemic in Beijing were analyzed and are shown in Figure 4 . Male and female input/output cases were basically consistent, and corresponding ratios were respectively 53%/ 47% and 56%/44%, indicating that infection risk of male population was slightly higher. Ages of the input/output cases were concentrated respectively in the ranges of 20-50 and 20-40, and the average ages were respectively 38.09 and 35.47. From the occupation point of view, input cases were concentrated in domestic/housework/service personnel, retirees, civil service/business/staff and health care personnel who accounted for a ratio of 47.36%, and output cases were concentrated in migrant labor/peasants/workers, domestic/housework/service personnel and teacher/student/ caregivers who accounted for a ratio of 54.43%. As for the characteristics of population movement, young migrant labors who are usually employed in construction/service/ restaurant industries became the main source of input cases of Beijing, the minor source should be tourists composed mainly of the retired and medical staff scheduled to Beijing for the epidemic control measures, and finally middle-aged business people traveling to Beijing were also the source of input cases who resulted in high average age of input cases. Output cases of Beijing were composed of common floating population as well as educational personnel among whom students are key members.",

Tobler's first law reveals the characteristics of spatial dependence, spatial association, and spatial autocorrelation of regionalized variables related with spatial location. Spatial statistical analysis mainly explains two key concepts in the first law of geography: relation and proximity. Generally, relation refers to similar spatial distribution of variables and proximity means there are adjacent boundaries between regions or the distance of region centroids is limited to a small critical value. And traditional spatial proximity could be extended to spatiotemporal proximity when the time dimension is consid- Figure 4 Attribute characteristics of SARS input and output cases of Beijing.

According to Table 2 , outer input cases had concentrated sources and the main hotspot regions were Shanxi and Guangdong, which had values of 2.73 and 2.02 for relative risk (RR) coefficients; primary hotspot region corresponding to outer output cases was Guangdong with an RR value of 9.23, and secondary hotspot regions included northern provinces centered in Inner Mongolia and Qinghai with RR values of 4.88 and 2.12 respectively. As shown in Figure 5 , outer control measures for SARS epidemic in Beijing should focus on the isolation of input cases from Shanxi and Guangdong, and meanwhile prevent the inner cases to transmit to Guangdong and northern provinces. As for both spatial and temporal abnormal hotspots, conclusions were slightly different. From Table 2 and Figure 6 , primary hotspots corresponding to outer input cases remained to be Shanxi with the time range from the 9th to the 12th week and a test statistic value of 3.8387, and time ranges of secondary hotspots including Fujian, Chongqing and Jilin maintained one week or so; primary hotspots corresponding to outer output cases remained to be Guangdong with the time range from the 3rd week to the 10th week and a test , and measures should be taken to prevent output cases from Beijing to Shandong and other provinces during the late period (after March). Overall, prevention and control measures for outer input cases should be taken at the early period and mid-period of the SARS outbreak and concentrated in provinces of Shanxi and Guangdong, and measures for outer output cases should be taken at the outbreak beginning and focus on Guangdong and northern provinces such as Shandong.",

However, risk ranges of input and output flows were different; for instance, input flow was of high-value degree but covered the concentrated risk areas (mainly in Shanxi and Guangdong), and the degree of output flow was not so high-value but the risk was more dispersed covering many areas including Guangdong and most northern provinces such as Shandong. With time unit of one week, temporal changes of in-degree and out-degree of outer in-out flow in Beijing were calculated and are shown in Figure 7 . Information can be concluded as follows: (1) out-degree appeared early and output cases from Beijing to other provinces began from late January, and in-degree appeared much later until the beginning of SARS outbreak in early March; (2) temporal change of out-degree was gentle, even though at the outbreak of SARS in late April, its value remained at the level from 5 to 15, and its value was mainly below 5 at early period of epidemic spread, indicating that out-flow from Beijing to other provinces affected a smaller range; (3) in-degree appeared in as late as the 9th week (early March) with an initial value of about 14, and soon expanded to 25-30, indicating that input flow covered the whole country in a relatively short time period; and (4) there were obvious turning points for temporal changes of in-degree, and it reduced from initial value of 14 to a value of 7 and then rapidly increased to the maximum in March, indicating that prevention and control measures of Beijing at the outbreak beginning were remarkably effective in about two weeks and played an important role in preventing the spread of outer input flow, but the input flow affected nationwide rapidly during the outbreak period because of the increasing strength of SARS outbreak or the failure of control measures.",

Therefore, inner output cases had significant characteristics of positive spatial autocorrelation in global area. Explanations could be proposed as follows for the above results: (1) inner self spread cases in Beijing mostly received treatment just in the same counties where he/she got infected, and would lead to insignificant spatial autocorrelation; (2) inner input cases lost the spatial autocorrelation due to the interference of inner self spread cases; and (3) inner output cases reflected the epidemic outbreak situation of districts and counties, and transformation pattern of individuals from getting infected to receiving treatment had relationship to some extent with spatial proximity and impact factors of districts, and therefore indicated significant positive spatial autocorrela-tion. For further consideration of the influence of gender, age and occupation of inner output cases, global Moran's I was applied for evaluation, and temporal changes (from March 23, 2003 to May 10, 2003, a total of seven weeks) of spatial autocorrelation of inner output cases were analyzed. The results are shown in Table 3 and Figure 8 , and some findings include: (1) spatial autocorrelation of female cases was slightly stronger than that of male cases, which was opposite to the overall gender distribution of SARS cases, but the difference according to gender was little; (2) there was weak significant spatial autocorrelation of cases younger than 20 and older than 60, but for cases of age from 20 to 60, the spatial autocorrelation was significant and increased with age; (3) there were obvious significant spatial autocorrelation of two types of populations including labor/ peasants/workers and health care personnel; the latter was affected more by nosocomial infection due to the medical services, and the former was typical urban immigratory population with regular activity range and mode and therefore represented more significant spatial autocorrelation; and (4) spatial autocorrelation of inner output cases was not obvious in the early period of SARS epidemic because there were lots of infection sources bringing more new cases and the isolation control measures were mainly for hospitals; during the peak period of SARS epidemic from the 3rd to the 6th week (April 6 to May 3), there was a sharp increase of new cases and isolation control measures were mainly for hospitals and households, and thus inner output cases indicated a strong spatial autocorrelation and the strength was basically consistent; in the late period, there was a sharp reduction of new cases and infection sources mostly remained as hospitals and households, and therefore inner output cases continuously indicated a strong spatial autocorrelation but the significance was little due to the decrease of total cases. Based on the above analysis, inner prevention and control measures for SARS epidemic in Beijing should focus on the isolations of inner output cases, minimize the virus spread caused by spatial transformation process of individuals for treatment, control the young and middle-aged with high-risk infection and with no gender differences, concentrate on surveillance of two types of populations including labor/peasants/workers and health care personnel, and at the peak period of SARS epidemic, pay more attention to control measures for the two main infection sources: hospitals and households.",

Risk analysis of inner output cases was implemented by software OpenGeoDa, and local spatial autocorrelation and risk levels were explored respectively according to typical attributes (gender/age/occupation) corresponding to significant global spatial autocorrelation. From Moran scatterplot of inner output cases in various districts of Beijing ( Figure  9 (a)) and distribution of risk types (Figure 9 (b)), high-risk regions of inner output cases were concentrated primarily in urban centers including Haidian, Chaoyang, Dongcheng, Xicheng and Fengtai districts, secondary high-risk regions were located in such urban areas as Chongwen, Xuanwu, Shijingshan districts as well as Changping in the northwest, and relatively safe region with low-risk was Miyun in the suburb northeast whereas other regions had no significant local spatial autocorrelation due to too small number of cases. The primary and secondary high-risk regions were located in the city center and formed a significant cluster, and only few suburbs in the northwest suffered from the virus high-risk spread while the northeast suburbs were low-risk and relatively safe. Above results showed that the overall prevention and control measures were remarkably effective. Under the assurance of that high-risk areas located in urban centers, control measures should be strengthened in suburbs in the northwest, and given the limited resources, measures for suburbs in the northeast could be lowered moderately. Figure 9 (c) and (d) shows that risk regional distribution of female cases was slightly stronger than that of male cases, which was consistent with gender distribution of global spatial autocorrelation, and distributions of high-risk areas of female and male cases were unanimous while that of male cases was relatively more concentrated. Figure 9 (e) and (f) illustrates that high-risk areas of cases aged from 20 to 40 were concentrated in two or three districts in urban centers and were without spread trend, and high-risk areas of cases aged from 40 to 60 covered most of the administrative districts in urban centers and were with apparent tendency of spreading high-risk to the suburbs in the northwest and southeast, indicating that isolation and control measures for young population were relatively effective and middle-aged population which had the consistent hotspot distribution with the overall distribution was the main spread source of SARS epidemic. Figure 9 (g) and (h) indicates that high risk areas of health care personnel were concentrated in a few regions in urban centers and were with only a weak spread trend to the southeast which showed isolation measures for nosocomial infection was significantly effective, and high risk areas of labor/peasants/workers which were high-risk spread source were located mainly in urban centers and were with a fixed pattern of spread trend.",

Overall, control measures during the whole epidemic period should focus primarily on urban central districts including Haidian, Chaoyang and Dongcheng and secondarily on another two central districts including Chongwen and Xuanwu, whereas attention should also be paid to Shijingshan district in the early epidemic period, and during the mid-late period, concentrated on urban central districts including Dongcheng and Fengtai as well as northwest suburbs including Changping, while simultaneously the strength of control measures to northeast suburbs including Miyun could be reduced appropriately.",

Numerous researches have provided detailed explanations to epidemic spread mechanism, spatiotemporal distribution, prevention/control measures and etc. However, there are still many unsolved mysteries about epidemic spread. Retrospective analysis based on existed epidemic spread could help analyze and interpret its spread mechanism and spatiotemporal characteristics, and provide good theoretical and practical supports for the prevention and control of novel infectious diseases in future. SARS epidemic in China in 2003 indicated the shortages of our epidemiological studies and the limitation of prevention/control measures with public health emergency, and meanwhile attracted worldwide interests and attentions for researchers to epidemiology. Recent studies on SARS epidemic spread have been extensive and effective, but there is still a lack of understanding and explanation of the spatial-temporal change mode of individual susceptible-infected-symptomatic-treated-recovered epidemic progress and the characteristics of information/material flow in the epidemic spread network between regions. SARS spread in-out flow was presented in this paper, which could effectively explain the transformation mechanism of individual location and the characteristics of information/material flow in the dynamic spread network, based on the SARS epidemiological investigation data in China from 2002 to 2003 and by the methods of spatial-temporal statistical analysis and network characteristic analysis, we explored and analyzed comprehensively epidemiological characteristics, spatial-temporal spread mechanism and high-risk hotspots in outer in-out flow, and spatial-temporal evolutive rules and structure characteristics in inner in-out flow, as well as evaluated and suggested prevention and control measures of SARS epidemic in Beijing. Compared with analysis methods based on infected cases or close contacts, the exploration and analysis in this paper from a new perspective help better detect and discover the potential spatial-temporal evolutive rules and characteristics of SARS epidemic and provide a more effective theoretical basis for emergency/control measures to other novel infectious diseases.",
