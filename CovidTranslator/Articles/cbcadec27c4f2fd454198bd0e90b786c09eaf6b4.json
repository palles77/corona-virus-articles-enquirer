The ''hygiene hypothesis\" relates this phenomenon to a decreasing incidence of childhood infections [2] . Chang and Pan [1] broadened the hypothesis by suggesting that to protect against allergic disease, the immune system would require frequent stimuli from environmental antigens, as well as from microbial infections, and that the exposure should continue beyond childhood. They defined environmental antigens as ''those otherwise innocuous antigens that come in contact with the mucosal surfaces, particularly those of the airway, gastrointestinal tract and eyes of people and animals and that can potentially induce immunological responses\". Environmental antigens would include allergens such as pollens, dust mites, moulds and animal dander.",

These abnormal responses may result in sensitization of the respiratory tract to otherwise innocuous antigens. This sensitization could lead to production of allergenspecific immunoglobulin E (IgE) that could attach to mast cells in tissues and to basophils in the circulation. Allergens could then interact with the IgE in a way that would cause the cells to release histamine and other pharmacological mediators with resultant symptoms of allergic rhinitis [1, 7] . 0306 Chang and Pan [1] consider that the environment and not genes is often the dominant factor in determining whether or not an individual develops an allergy. This suggestion is consistent with reports that after the fall of the communist systems in Europe, the prevalence of hay fever, asthma and airway hyper-responsiveness was significantly higher in children aged 9-11 in West Germany than in East Germany [6] . Follow-up studies have shown that the incidence of allergic disease has increased in East Germany as the population has adopted ''western lifestyles\" [1, 3] .",

Alternatively, the antigens may induce a state of immune tolerance [8] [9] [10] .

            "text": "The pioneering studies on vaccine development for the poultry industry in the 1930s included an innovative approach that might be applied for immunizing humans. It was shown that chickens could be protected against a viral disease with a tropism for the larynx and trachea by applying vaccine to the cloacal mucosa, located at the terminal end of the digestive tract. Initially the vaccine consisted of mucous taken from the respiratory tract of diseased chickens that would have contained the causative herpesvirus [22] . This experience suggests that the virus in secretions collected from the human respiratory tract in the early stages of a common cold, might serve as a crude vaccine if applied to the anal region. Having considered this, a healthy adult male, referred to herein as ''the principal\", collected secretions from his respiratory tract on tissue paper and applied this to his anal region. This became a routine daily practice and was carried out for 4 years. The principal followed this practice with the understanding that low quantities of respiratory virus may occasionally be found in the secretions in the absence of respiratory symptoms [16] . Secretions from the respiratory tract would also contain environmental antigens and a variety of bacteria, including potential pathogens. During the 4 year trial period, the principal experienced no ill effects that could be attributed to this practice. To the contrary, he experienced a marked diminution in problems attributed to the common cold. Unexpectedly, he also experienced a marked reduction in problems due to seasonal allergic rhinitis. These observations suggested the possibility that respiratory viruses, environmental antigens and other antigenic agents in the respiratory secretions applied to the anal region had stimulated immune responses in tissues at the site of application that had protected the respiratory tract. However, the principal's observations do not have scientific validity. Other factors, of which he was unaware, may have contributed to his improved health. Nevertheless, by applying respiratory secretions containing antigenic agents to the perianal skin and anal mucosa, the principal was performing both transcutaneous [23, 24] and mucosal immunization [25, 26] . These forms of vaccination stimulate immune responses that can extend to the respiratory tract.",

This practice was a crude form of transcutaneous and mucosal vaccination and would have brought antigens from the environment into contact with the immune defences in both the perianal skin and anal mucosa. Today, in developed countries, this natural form of exposure to antigenic agents from the environment has almost been eliminated by the move to indoor toiletry, where toilet paper and purified water are used for cleansing purposes. Also, until the 1960s, it was common practice in North America to use cloth diapers and to dry these and other clothing, towels and bedding on lines outdoors where they would have collected a variety of environmental allergens and infectious agents. Thus, from birth the skin was exposed to antigenic agents that could have penetrated into the tissue and elicited immune responses. The increased use of disposable diapers and clothes dryers since the 1960s has also reduced exposure of the skin to antigenic agents from the environment.",

Studies on transcutaneous immunization support this claim and Glenn et al. [23] consider that ''the skin represents an ideal route to the immune system: by traveling the microbial footpath of the multiple, repeated daily challenges on the surface of the skin, vaccines can achieve effective and robust immune responses\". It has been shown that disruption and wetting of the skin's protective stratum corneum can greatly facilitate the passage of antigens and infectious agents into the epidermis where they can be trapped by dendritic Langerhans cells and transported to lymph nodes for presentation to T cells. The chain of events could lead to both cellular and humoral immune responses [23, 24] . Adjuvants, such as bacterial toxins, may be applied to the skin along with antigens and can greatly augment the immune response [23, 24] . The perianal skin should be well suited for the uptake and response to foreign antigens as the stratum corneum is always moist and is frequently disrupted during cleaning. Furthermore, the stratum corneum would be covered with bacterial products that may have an adjuvant effect on the applied vaccines. Concerning the role for mucosal immunization, Seipp [25] states that ''if an immune response is generated in the gastrointestinal lining, T cells produced there can travel to other mucosal sites, for example, the lungs or nasal cavity, providing protection over a large surface area\".",

This approach to immunotherapy would be less likely to cause adverse reactions than would preparations of purified allergens administered by injection into subcutaneous tissues [30] . To maintain protection, frequent application of specific allergens throughout life may be necessary and this could probably be achieved in a more convenient and acceptable manner via the anal mucosa rather than via the sublingual mucosa. While subcutaneous immunotherapy has been practiced for many years, the risk to benefit ratio has not always been favourable [30] and immunity may only endure for one year [7] .

However, most respiratory viruses would not be expected to survive passage through the digestive tract and to date there is no data to support the hypothesis that common cold viruses or influenza viruses, in a natural or altered state, could infect the anal mucosa or perianal skin. Yet, there appears to be no data to the contrary. In a study by Cate et al. [31] , rhinovirus that was inoculated into the duodenum of volunteers, failed to survive passage through the intestinal tract. This failure was attributed in part to body temperature, as viruses of this group replicate best in the upper respiratory tract at temperatures of about 33\u00b0C. However, in the same study, a volunteer that was infected with rhinovirus via the respiratory tract developed respiratory symptoms. An unexplained finding was that the virus was detected in a stool specimen but not in the rectal mucosa of that volunteer. Although speculative, it is proposed that the tissue paper used by the volunteer to capture his respiratory secretions contained virus that was inadvertently applied to his anal region, resulting in an infection at that site. This would explain why the quantity of virus detected in the stool specimen exceeded what would occur from mechanical contamination. Conditions may be more favourable for growth of respiratory viruses at the terminal end rather than in more proximal portions of the digestive tract. This expectation gives a rationale for applying vaccines to the anal region.",

Influenza viruses for vaccine purposes are usually propagated in embryonated chicken eggs [18] . A major deterrent to the development of vaccines against the common cold has been the large number of viruses that can circulate in a population at the same time [13] . However, a live virus vaccine applied to the anal region could be composed of a mixture of many groups and strains of virus. Reverse genetics techniques have increased the possibility of rapidly constructing strains of respiratory syncytial virus or of influenza viruses that could have potential as live virus vaccines to be administered to the nasal mucosa [15, 18, 32] . It is expected that the same techniques could be used to construct viruses that could propagate and stimulate immune responses in the anal mucosa. The respiratory syncytial virus tends to be cell-associated, making it difficult to obtain high titres of purified cell-free virus [15] . However, topical administration of cellular debris containing virus to the anal mucosa should not pose a problem. Immunity induced by viruses in the respiratory tract may be short-lived, whereas the frequent self-administration of viruses to the anal region should make it possible to stimulate and maintain levels of immunity required for protection. A safety feature in applying respiratory viruses to the anal region of infants is that the area would be covered by a diaper. Also, the respiratory syncytial virus is noted for its instability [15] .",

In contrast, respiratory viruses applied to the anal region would be expected to remain localized and would be less likely to have undesirable side effects. Killed vaccines require much larger quantities of virus than live vaccines. In the case of influenza virus, 10 billion virus particles produced in a single embryonated chicken egg may constitute a single dose of the vaccine [18] . In comparison, the amount of virus produced in a single egg may be sufficient to vaccinate thousands of people with a live virus vaccine. In the face of an influenza pandemic, there would be an urgent need for safe vaccines that could be applied to prevent widespread morbidity and mortality [32] . Production of live virus vaccines that could be self-applied to the anal region may make this possible.
