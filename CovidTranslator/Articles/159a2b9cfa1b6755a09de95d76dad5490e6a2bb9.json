To address this question, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural responses in participants (n=40) evoked by food and social cues after ten hours of mandated fasting or total social isolation. After isolation, people felt lonely and craved social interaction. Midbrain regions showed increased activation to food cues after fasting and to social cues after isolation; these responses were correlated with self-reported craving. Neural patterns in response to food cues when participants were hungry generalized to social cues after isolation. Our results support the intuitive idea that acute isolation causes social craving, similar to hunger. : bioRxiv preprint homology to human loneliness has been disputed(14), and it is not possible to assess whether a mouse subjectively feels lonely.",

To differentiate between pre-existing individual differences and the direct effects of isolation, we needed to induce isolation experimentally in a within-subject design, similar to the experimental studies of rodents(43, 46). However, human loneliness is not a simple product of objective isolation: people can be alone without feeling lonely, or feel lonely even in a crowd(47). Moreover, experimentally induced isolation would necessarily be brief, relative to the human lifespan, and for ethical reasons, human participants (unlike rodents) would be able to predict when the isolation would end. In all, the first challenge of this research was to develop an experimental induction of objective isolation that created the subjective experience of unmet social needs in human participants. To address this challenge, we had socially-connected healthy human adults spend ten hours (9 am to 7 pm) alone, with no social interaction and no other social stimulation (e.g. social media, email, fiction). We used self-report questionnaires to assess people's resulting subjective experience of loneliness and social craving.",

In primates, aversive motivation is represented in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA)(23), and SN/VTA is activated by craving for food and for drugs of addiction(28-30). We therefore hypothesized that acute isolation in humans might produce a social craving response in SN/VTA. Neuroimaging of the SN/VTA poses a technical challenge, though, because it is a small structure, adjacent to the sphenoid sinus (a large, air-filled cavity located anterior to the brainstem) and therefore prone to distortions and signal loss (19, 20) . To address this challenge, we optimized MRI image acquisition parameters, and used a newly developed atlas(48) to identify SN/VTA in individual participants' brains.",

Chronic social isolation and loneliness are associated with lower physical(1-5) and mental (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) health, but little is known about the consequences of acute mandatory isolation. Positive social interactions in and of themselves may be basic human needs, analogous to other basic needs like food consumption or sleep (10) (11) (12) . If so, the absence of positive social interaction may create a want, or \"craving\", that motivates behavior to repair what is lacking (10) . Cues associated with positive social interaction (e.g., smiling faces) activate neural reward systems (13, for review) .

            "text": "In social animals, social interactions act as primary rewards (31) (32) (33) (34) : they are inherently pleasurable and motivate behavior in the absence of any other reward. Rodents, for example, spontaneously seek social contact (35) , fare better in group housing than in isolated housing (35, 36) and cooperate with and help cage mates (37) (38) (39) (40) . Extended periods of isolation, especially during development, can dramatically disrupt behavior and brain function (41, 42) . Even a brief acute period of social isolation in rodents induces an increased motivation for subsequent social interaction (43) . This increased sociability depends on midbrain DA neurons (44) , similar to other kinds of craving (45, for review) . After 24 hours of isolation, DA neurons of the midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are activated when the mice seek social interaction. Optogenetic activation of DRN DA neurons increases sociability, and deactivation reduces post-isolation sociability, especially in socially dominant mice. Importantly, DRN activity is not inherently pleasant (and thus is unlikely to reflect reward anticipation): mice learn to avoid novel places where these neurons are stimulated. Thus, DRN DA neurons in mice appear to encode an aversive \"loneliness-like\" state that motivates social engagement (44) . However, the levels (19, 49) . In the substantia nigra in particular, ~70% of the neurons are dopaminergic, so fMRI signals in this brain area likely mainly reflect DA neuron activity (20, for review) . To address this challenge, we employed two strategies: first, we developed a cue-induced craving paradigm, in which participants viewed pictures of their favourite social activities, favourite foods, and a pleasant baseline (flowers). We included favourite foods so that we could compare social craving, within participants, to a well-established neural craving response, evoked by viewing food cues after several hours of fasting (29, for review) . Second, we included an independent functional localizer task to identify voxels in each participant's midbrain that are maximally sensitive to expected reward and novelty, consistent with DA activity (15) . We then tested for responses to social cues after isolation, in these voxels in particular.",

Because we aimed to study social motivation in a sample of adults who have frequent and regular social interactions, we also excluded people who i) lived alone, ii) reported current feelings of loneliness on the UCLA Loneliness Scale(57) (i.e., we excluded people with scores above 50, which is one standard deviation above the mean for a student sample (57)); or iii) reported smaller social network sizes than typically expected of adults (58) according to a social network size measure (59) and the Social Support Questionnaire(60) (i.e., we excluded people with social networks 2 or more SD below mean, based on prior measured distributions from Von der Heide et al. 2014 (61) ). All experimental procedures were approved by MIT's institutional review board, COUHES (couhes.mit.edu). Participants signed a consent form describing all experimental procedures before participating in the study. Each participant was compensated with $350 for participating in three fMRI sessions and completing the 10 hours of food fasting and 10 hours of social isolation.",

In addition, whole-head T1-weighted structural images in 176 interleaved sagittal slices with 1 mm isotropic voxels (FOV: 256 mm) were collected. The T2* weighted anatomical scan was collected for anatomical identification of midbrain nuclei (i.e., the high content of iron in SN/VTA and red nucleus makes the T2* shorter and darker in these areas (19, 20) ). We confirmed the identification of mid-brain structures by registering to the newly available atlas of subcortical nuclei from Pauli et al. (48) and defined separate regions of interest in the dorsal and ventral striatum. We also collected a field map (phase-difference B0 estimation; TE1=3.47ms, TE2=5.93ms) to control for spatial distortions, which are particularly problematic in midbrain fMRI (19, 20) .

The fMRI time series were analyzed using an event-related design approach implemented in the context of the GLM. The model contained two regressors separately modeling the presentation of novel/reward cues, and familiar/non-reward cues (i.e., when the abstract art images were presented, 2s). We also included one regressor for the time period of button press and outcome (1.1s). Because we did not add any jitter between button press and presentation of outcome To test whether these responses were correlated with individual differences in self-reported craving, we calculated the average contrast value (food>flowers and social>flowers) in the anatomically defined SN/VTA for each participant. We used two different approaches to measure participants' self-reported craving. First, we calculated the mean craving rating participants reported on each trial during the CIC task in the scanner (Craving_CIC). This measure was exactly comparable across sessions, and simultaneous with the fMRI data acquisition. Second, we took the craving reported by participants on the final online questionnaire, completed after 10 hours of fasting or isolation (Craving_Q). On this measure participants only reported craving for the deprived need (food when fasting, social contact when isolated), but this measure provides the most direct measure of the effect of deprivation because it can be compared to the self-report at the beginning of each session. In addition, the Craving_Q ratings were completed on a finer scale (0-100 instead of 0-10) and participants had no time restriction when filling out the questionnaires (while during the task, participants had 5s to complete the scales). For these reasons, we include both types of craving ratings and report results as significant at \u03b1<0.025. We measured correlations between self-reported craving and neural responses for each deprivation session. Because we specifically predicted a positive correlation between craving for the deprived target and response magnitude in SN/VTA, these correlations were tested one-tailed. Data for the analyses was extracted using FSL's fslmeants utility and subsequent univariate and correlation analyses were conducted in Matlab 2019b and SPSS 25.",

Finally, we used representational similarity analysis to test which pattern of activity is more similar to 'food_craved': social_craved or food_noncraved. We predicted that the presence of a craved object should be more important for SN/VTA activity than the specific object, so we predicted that the pattern of food_craved responses will be more similar to the pattern of activity for social_craved than for food_noncraved.

We predicted that individual variability in response to objective isolation might reflect pre-existing differences in participants' social network size and/or chronic loneliness. Consistent with this prediction, participants with higher levels of chronic loneliness during the initial screening reported less craving for social contact after 10 hours of isolation in response to the social cues in the cue-induced craving task (Social_Craving_CIC: r(38)=-0.36; p=0.020; two-tailed) and somewhat less craving on the online questionnaire (Social_Craving_Q: r(38)=-0.30; p=0.059; two-tailed). People with higher pre-existing chronic loneliness also showed a muted response in SN/VTA to social cues after acute isolation (r(38)=-0.35; p=0.027; two-tailed). Individual differences in social network size did not predict either self-reported or neural responses to acute social isolation (all p-values >= 0.18). We explored whether pre-existing loneliness was also associated with different responses to food cues after fasting and find that while loneliness did not affect self-reported food craving (p-values p>0.307), higher loneliness was associated with lower post-fasting SN/VTA responses to food cues (r(38)=-0.32; p=0.042; two-tailed).",

Despite the fact that isolation lasted only ten hours, and the participants knew exactly when it would end, participants reported more loneliness and social craving at the end of the day than they did at the beginning. For our participants, who are all highly socially connected, a day of social isolation was a very large deviation from typical rates of social interaction. Although being alone is not inherently aversive for people (i.e., when chosen intentionally, solitude can be restful and rejuvenating (80, 81) ), our isolation paradigm was subjectively aversive: participants felt more uncomfortable and less happy at the end of the day. In the current paradigm, isolation was likely made more salient by the externally mandated (not personally chosen) restrictions on participants' behaviour, including bans on email, social media, fiction, films, music, and other forms of virtual and fictional connectedness(82) (though participants did have access to games, puzzles, and reading material). The cessation of virtual social interaction was a substantial change: typical young adults currently use social media for social interactions more than two hours per day (83) . In all, this experiment demonstrates that acute objective social isolation can induce subjective social craving in human participants.

This pattern is consistent with prior evidence that chronic loneliness is associated with reduced social approach motivation (84) : loneliness is associated with higher self-centeredness (85) , preference for larger interpersonal space (86) , and decreased motivation to approach good social outcomes (87) .

To measure craving-related activity, we designed a cue-induced craving paradigm -a classic paradigm used to measure craving responses in the brain (90) (91) (92) (93) (94) . Food cues were images of each participant's favourite foods (as reported on the screening survey), accompanied by brief verbal descriptions to promote recognition of the relevant attributes of the image and deeper semantic encoding. Similarly, social cues were images of people engaged in each participant's favourite social activities. We chose to use images of strangers, rather than images of the participant's own friends and family, so that all images in all conditions would be novel to participants, since SN/VTA activity is sensitive to novelty(63).

In rodents, for example, social isolation increases voluntary alcohol intake (42, 97, 98) as well as morphine consumption (99, 100) , and can alter DA release in response to alcohol intake (97) . A key predictor may be the duration (and possibly the developmental timing) of the isolation: short term acute isolation in adults may cause selective social motivation, whereas long-term or developmental isolation could lead to more general compensatory changes. Indeed, in our sample we find that participants who report higher levels of chronic loneliness show reduced activity in the SN/VTA in response to social cues, consistent with prior evidence(101) (but see (102) , (103)), but also to food cues, including on the baseline day. Thus, chronic loneliness might lead to broad alterations in the human motivation system, as in the animal models. However, the causal mechanism underlying these correlations remains unclear: individuals with reduced activity in motivational brain areas might be more prone to becoming lonely. This possibility highlights the importance of experimentally inducing acute isolation, to disentangle direct effects of isolation per se from individual differences in reward seeking behavior more generally.",

Social rejection may thus evoke a craving response similar to effects of social isolation. However, we suggest that social rejection (being deliberately and specifically excluded from social interaction) is conceptually distinct from social isolation (being unable to access social interaction). By contrast to the under-studied effects of social isolation, there is extensive research on the behavioural and neural sequelae of social rejection(108, .

Unexpected and undeserved deliberate rejection or exclusion is painful, and evokes a pattern of neural response associated with processing of aversive states like physical pain, including bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (108, 109, for reviews). These brain areas were not recruited by social craving in the current task (see Supplemental material table S2). Rejection and isolation are also likely to have different emotional and behavioural effects. Social rejection can lead to increased motivation to affiliate with others but also to withdrawal and anger (110, 111) ; whereas isolation may be more likely to cause approach and a motivation to re-connect. Thus, while both social isolation and social rejection are aversive to humans, these states are likely distinct both behaviourally and neurally.",

Thus, it appears, that even without specific deprivation, SN/VTA shows craving responses for food and social contact which correspond to participants' subjective feelings of craving. Rewarding stimuli (including food and social contact) are craved even without specific deprivation (16) . Possibly our participants' daily routines do not satisfy their needs for food and social contact. In addition, at baseline, participants' motivation may be spread generally across multiple sources of reward; specific acute deprivation might serve to narrow (rather than enhance) the brain's motivational responses to the deprived target. If so, acute hunger might reduce social motivation compared to baseline. Indeed, there is some evidence that people are less prosocial when hungry (112) , consistent with a reduction in social motivation caused by acute hunger, although see (113) .",

Technological advances offer incessant opportunities to be virtually connected with others, despite physical separations. Yet, some have argued that using social medial only exacerbates subjective feelings of isolation(118, for review) but see (119, 120) . Future studies could compare SN/VTA responses to social cues following isolation with and without access to social media. The capacity for virtual interactions to fulfill social needs is particularly relevant when large populations are required to self-isolate, for example during a global pandemic. In early 2020, millions of humans experienced a sudden externally mandated period of relative or complete physical isolation from others, as public health officials sought to slow the spread of an infectious novel corona virus. This unprecedented upheaval in people's social routines emphasized the need for a better understanding of human social needs and the neural mechanisms underlying social motivation. The current study provides a first step in that direction.",

For our planned analyses, we used mixed effects regressions (using Matlab 2019b's fitlme function) to estimate the fixed effects of cue, deprivation session, and the critical interaction of cue and deprivation session, on response magnitude in the ROIs, controlling for each session's average framewise displacement (i.e. head motion), with subject included as a random effect (for further details of the models, see Supplementary Materials). We modeled these effects in the anatomically defined SN/VTA (pre-registered analysis) and in the functionally defined ROI of voxels maximally sensitive to reward and novelty (exploratory analysis).",

As expected, after ten hours of food fasting participants reported increased food craving (t(36)=17.40, p<0.001), hunger (t(36)=23.90, p<0.001), discomfort (t(36)=11.74, p<0.001) and dislike of fasting (t(36)=5.70, p<0.001), and decreased happiness (t(36)=-3.25, p=0.002). Thus, both forms of abstinence evoked craving for the specifically deprived need, along with general discomfort and decreased happiness.Though we note that social craving after isolation was more variable, across participants, than food craving after fasting (mean(standard deviation) of craving ratings on questionnaire, after 10 hours: food craving=80.25(19.39); social craving=66.38(24.52),Figure 2; Levene's test indicated unequal variances (F(76)=15.86, p<0.001).",

The violin plots depict the difference (in percent signal change) in response to food cues (contrast: food>flowers) and social cues (contrast: social>flowers) after fasting and after isolation. The violins illustrate the distribution of the data, the white dots indicate the median, the bold dark grey vertical line the interquartile range and the thin grey lines the upper/lower adjacent values. Left upper panel: Responses in the anatomical SN/VTA were higher for food after fasting. Left lower panel: Responses in the midbrain functional ROI were higher for food after fasting and for social cues after isolation. Right panel: In the anatomical SN/VTA, responses to food cues were correlated with craving reported in the Cue Induced Craving task, following fasting (upper panel) and responses to social cues were correlated with craving reported on the final Questionnaire, following isolation (lower panel). As a direct test of the similarity of activity patterns for food cues after fasting, and social cues after isolation, we trained a classifier on the pattern of activity in the SN/VTA after fasting to food cues and flower images. This learned classifier then generalized to above chance decoding of food from flower images on both of the other sessions (Isolation session: mean accuracy=0.54; t(39)=3.01, p=0.005; Baseline session: mean accuracy=0.55; t(39)=3.35, p=0.002). The same learned classifier could also decode social cues from flower images after isolation (mean accuracy=0.54; t(39)=3.53, p=0.001). On the baseline day, the classification accuracy did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (\u03b1 =0.05/4; mean accuracy=0.53; t(39)=2.59, p=0.013).
