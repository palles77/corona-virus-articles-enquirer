Identification of sustainable and effective measures to mitigate PRRSV transmission is a pressing problem. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV plays a crucial role in inhibiting host innate immunity during PRRSV infection. In the current study, a new host-restricted factor, tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), was identified as an inhibitor of PRRSV replication. Coimmunoprecipitation assay indicated that the PRRSV N protein interferes with TRIM25-RIG-I interactions by competitively interacting with TRIM25. Furthermore, N protein inhibits the expression of TRIM25 and TRIM25mediated RIG-I ubiquitination to suppress interferon \u03b2 production. Furthermore, with increasing TRIM25 expression, the inhibitory effect of N protein on the ubiquitination of RIG-I diminished. These results indicate for the first time that TRIM25 inhibits PRRSV replication and that the N protein antagonizes the antiviral activity by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. This not only provides a theoretical basis for the development of drugs to control PRRSV replication, but also better explains the mechanism through which the PRRSV N protein inhibits innate immune responses of the host. \u204e",

Immediately after a viral infection, pathogen-associated molecular patterns are sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), thereby allowing cells to distinguish self from non-self and activate an immune response (Sparrer and Gack, 2015) . For RNA viruses, the main cytoplasmic PRR is retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which can directly recognize and bind viral 5\u2032-PPP RNA and short double-stranded RNA (Chan and Gack, 2016) . After recognition, the N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) of RIG-I are modified by ubiquitin which is mediated by TRIM25. Such modification is essential for activating a signaling cascade, ultimately resulting in the transcriptional activation of type I and III interferons (IFNs), mediating viral clearance, and inhibiting viral replication and spread (Gack et al., 2009; Martin-Vicente et al., 2017) . Various viruses are inhibited by TRIM25, e.g., Coxsackie B virus and poliovirus (Schoggins et al., 2014) .",

ORF1a and ORF1b encode two large nonstructural polyproteins, ppla and pplb, which are processed into at least 14 nonstructural proteins (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . ORF2a-ORF7 encode structural proteins, including four membrane-associated glycoproteins (GP2a, GP3, GP4, and GP5), three unglycosylated membrane proteins (E, ORF5a, and M), and a nucleocapsid protein (N) (Dea et al., 2000; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Among these, nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, nsp11, and been identified and characterized as IFN antagonists (Lunney et al., 2016) . Further, the N protein is the most abundant protein during infection, accounting for approximately 40% of virion proteins (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . It plays essential roles in the virus life cycle, including encapsidation of viral RNA (Spilman et al., 2009) . Currently, it is only known that N protein suppresses IFN-\u03b2 induction by antagonizing IRF3 activation (Sagong and Lee, 2011) . However, other mechanisms through which N protein inhibits IFN-\u03b2 production are not clear. The nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) inhibits type I IFN production by interfering with TRIM25mediated RIG-I ubiquitination (Hu et al., 2017) . Whereas PRRSV and SARS both belong to the Nidovirales order, whether PRRSV N protein inhibits the host innate immune response by interfering with TRIM25mediated RIG-I ubiquitination is not clear.",

However, in the course of natural infection, PRRSV can complete the replication cycle and efficiently spread. Hence, PRRSV has evolved several general strategies to evade the innate immune response. It has been reported that some viral proteins interact with TRIM25 and inhibit RIG-I activation. For example, the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A virus interacts with the CC domain of TRIM25 preventing its dimerization and the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I CARDs, thereby suppressing RIG-I signal transduction (Gack et al., 2009) . Further, TRIM25 interacts with the N protein of SARS-CoV, thereby inhibiting the activation of RIG-I (Hu et al., 2017) . In the current study, we found that the N protein of PRRSV inhibits the ubiquitination of RIG-I by competitively interfering with the interaction between RIG-I and TRIM25. This might be the mechanism through which PRRSV inhibits the antiviral effect of TRIM25. Furthermore, TRIM25 levels decreased when the cells were infected with PRRSV. In addition, when plasmids expressing TRIM25 and the N protein of PRRSV were cotransfected into cells, the expression of TRIM25 was significantly suppressed. Based on this, it would be difficult for TRIM25 to exert an antiviral effect upon PRRSV infection. This might represent another mechanism through which PRRSV antagonizes the antiviral response of TRIM25. Besides, the N protein of PEDV, another coronavirus, is also able to antagonize IFN-\u03b2 production (Ding et al., 2014) . Since PRRSV, SARS, and PEDV all belong to Nidovirales, we speculate that the respective N proteins may exert a similar effect of inhibiting TRIM25mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I. However, the effect of PEDV N protein on the inhibition of RIG-I ubiquitination requires further research.",

Further, PRRSV can antagonize the antiviral activity of this protein by decreasing its expression and modulating the TRIM25mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I. In addition, the N protein of PRRSV inhibits IFN-\u03b2 production. All these mechanisms improve the understanding of the effect of TRIM25 on PRRSV replication and will further Co-IP experiment was performed using agarose beads conjugated with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody or (B) agarose beads conjugated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by WB using antibodies against the Flag and HA tags. (C) Co-localization of the N protein with TRIM25. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-N protein and Flag-TRIM25. After 24 h, the cells were fixed and analyzed by IFA to detect tagged N protein and TRIM25, using mouse anti-HA and rabbit anti-Flag monoclonal antibodies, respectively. The nucleus is stained with DAPI (blue) in the merged images. (D and E) Colocalization and interaction of PRRSV N and endogenous TRIM25. PAM cells infected with PRRSV were fixed 24 h after infection, and then subjected to indirect immunofluorescence to detect N protein and TRIM25. In addition, cell lysates from PRRSV-infected or mock-infected PAM cells were Co-IP with mouse anti-N polyclonal antibody, and the precipitates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). K. Zhao, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 233 (2019) 140-146 help to understand how PRRSV evades the TRIM25-mediated innate immune response via the N protein. Hence, the current study not only offers a new target for the development of drugs to control PRRSV spread but also provides an explanation of the mechanism through which PRRSV N protein modulates host innate immune responses. in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and in the decision to submit the article for publication. 5 . The PRRSV N protein suppresses the TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. HEK293 T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 36 h, and were infected (with or without SEV) for 12 h. Anti-Flag immunoprecipitates prepared from the cell extracts were analyzed by WB using the indicated antibodies.",
