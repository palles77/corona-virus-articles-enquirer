Early diagnosis and treatment are important to reducing mortality, but the diagnosis is difficult because of the rarity of the syndrome and the lack of specificity of the clinical findings.

            "text": "The incidence of HLH is difficult to estimate because this condition is probably underdiagnosed. It is a primarily pediatric disease, with increased incidence in children younger than 3 months. A national retrospective study of Japan 6,7 revealed an HLH incidence of 1/800,000 inhabitants/year (56% of cases in children younger than 14 years). The frequency of the various forms of HLH varies according to age. In patients between 14 and 29 years of age, HLH associated with infection (HLH-I) was the most common (68% of cases, half of them associated with EBV infection). In this age group, the second leading cause was HLH associated with autoimmune diseases (MAS: 22%), followed by HLH associated with tumors (HLH-T: 10%). In the patient group aged 30---59 years, HLH-T occurred somewhat less frequently than HLH-I (37% and 47%, respectively), followed by MAS (9%) and HLH associated with bone marrow transplantation (7%). In the patient group older than 60 years, neoplasms were the most common cause (68%), followed by infections (26%; only one quarter with EBV) and MAS (6%). Another recent retrospective Swedish study showed an annual incidence of HLH-T in adults of 0.36 cases/100,000 individuals/year. 8 FHLH occurs in 1/30,000---50,000 births and in 80% of cases, manifests during the first year of life. 7, 9 Pathophysiology In healthy individuals, the recognition of a foreign antigen will start an inflammatory cascade, with the releasing of cytokines by Th1 immune response cells (IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423, IL-18 and others), which induces the proliferation of NK and T-lymphocyte cells. These cells harbor granules that contain cytolytic enzymes (perforin and granzyme). The combined action of these cytolytic proteins induces apoptosis of the target cells, eliminating the antigenic stimulant and signaling the termination of the inflammatory response (Fig. 1 ). 2 Various mutations have been described in genetic HLH in the loci that regulate the expression and activity of cytotoxic granules in the effector cells (T lymphocytes and NK), which contain perforin and granzyme, which explains the deterioration or lack of function in the Th1 response. These mutations include PRF1, UNC13D, STXBP1, LAR, STX11, SH2D1A and XIAP 10 and affect the trafficking of intracellular vesicles and lead to insufficient levels of perforin or defective vesicular exocytosis. When perforin-mediated cytotoxicity is reduced or absent, the elimination of foreign and/or dangerous noxas in the host is compromised, the antigenic stimulation is maintained and there is no termination or ''switching-off'' of the immune response. This defect leads to the hyperactivation and expansion of effector cells (histiocytes, macrophages and CD8+ T cells), which can infiltrate various organs, and to cytokine overexpression (''cytokine storm''). The result of this process is the uncontrolled and ineffective activation of the immune response, cellular damage and multiple organ dysfunction (Fig. 2) . 2, 11 Hemophagocytosis is the histological signature of this disease and is caused by the activation of well-differentiated macrophages that ''devour'' blood cells in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, liver and other organs. However, hemophagocytosis might not be observed when the first clinical manifestations of HLH appear and is not a specific trait, given that it can also be found in various inflammatory and infectious diseases. 12 In acquired HLH, the mechanisms that lead to a defect in cytotoxicity and a poorly controlled immune response are probably multifactorial and have not been completely defined. These mechanisms include hypomorphic mutations and polymorphisms in genes that regulate the immune response, interference by the virus in the cytotoxic function and imbalances between infected and effector cells. 13 The line separating the genetic forms from the acquired forms is increasingly blurred, and the clinical spectrum of HLH represents a continuous risk. Patients who maintain completely preserved immune function have a low probability of presenting the disease, and the mutations that affect the cytotoxic function lower the threshold so that HLH can appear, more so the larger its contribution to hyperactivity CD8 mediated cytotoxicity. Therefore, the acquired forms, which manifest in adults, lie in the gray area between patients with normal immunity and the familial forms with severe defects in cell immunity, who manifest the disease in the first months of life. 13---15 ",

The most characteristic immunological test results are an increased plasma concentration of soluble IL-2 receptor \u2423 (CD25s), reflecting the overall hyperactivation of the immune response, and NK cell deficiency. 16 The most characteristic trait is hemophagocytosis. 2 Although the clinical manifestations and laboratory results are characteristic, HLH has no pathognomonic disorder. Therefore, the Histiocyte Society has proposed joining a series of clinical criteria for its diagnosis (Table 3) . 6 This is a disease that is difficult to diagnose and is probably underdiagnosed (due to its low incidence, variable presentation and nonspecific clinical manifestations), as demonstrated by a comprehensive review conducted in Sweden, in which only 11 of 32 patients were diagnosed before their death. 9 The key points to confirm the diagnosis are reviewing the medical history, performing a complete medical examination and laboratory tests to investigate the affected organs, performing a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, monitoring ferritin levels, conducting a proper immunologic study, investigating the existence of characteristic mutations in the familial forms and ruling out the presence of triggers. We suspect this disease when faced with a patient with high fever and multiple-organ dysfunction, especially if they do not respond to the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. If hemophagocytosis is not observed in the first bone marrow biopsy, it is advisable to repeat the biopsy, given that it might be present at the start of the symptoms. Very high ferritin levels, or those that rapidly increase, are highly suggestive of HLH. A ferritin level >10,000 g/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 96% for HLH, almost without overlapping with sepsis, infections or hepatic failure. 17 For all patients, even adults, we cannot rule out the familial forms without analyzing the genetic mutations that define them (Table 3) . It is important to identify the presence of potential triggers (Table 2), given that the early treatment of these conditions can sometimes eliminate the stimulation of the immune activation and clinically improve the HLH, which thereby avoids more toxic immunosuppressant (Table 4) . 18 When ruling out the presence of viral infections, viral load determinations by molecular techniques are of more assistance than serological studies. Differential diagnoses should be performed with all entities that produce high fever, cytopenia, hepatic dysfunction and visceromegaly, with or without other organ failures. The main diagnostic challenge is to differentiate HLH from other diseases that cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome with multiple organ dysfunction, especially severe sepsis. For children, HLH should be differentiated from storage diseases that progress with organomegaly, Kawasaki disease and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. In adults, HLH can also be confused with lymphoproliferative syndromes. 16",

Therapeutic decisions should therefore be based on clinical experience and expert recommendations. 6, 19 The Histiocyte Society recommends a treatment for HLH in children that includes the following: dexamethasone, cyclosporine A and etoposide (known as protocol HLH-04), with intrathecal methotrexate in the event of neurological involvement, and bone marrow transplantation for the familial forms or those refractory to treatment. 6 For FHLH, this treatment improves survival (from 0% to 50%) and can cure the disease. 20 The use of this protocol in adults is less studied, but a case series analysis indicated that it can be useful, especially when the disease is associated with viral infections and tumors. 19 The HLH-04 protocol combined with rituximab has been used successfully in viral infections, especially, in EBV infection. 21 Other treatments employed in HLH include the intravenous administration of immunoglobulins (adults with rheumatic infections or disease), 22 plasmapheresis and anti-TNF drugs (associated with autoimmune diseases). 19 HLH therapy is complex due to the dynamic course of the disease, the toxicity of the drugs employed and the risk of relapses. Therefore, a number of experts have designed therapy algorithms. 23 A more comprehensive description of HLH treatment is beyond the scope of this review but can be found in recent publications. 2, 6, 16, 19, 23 ",

Mild cases of EBV-associated HLH should be treated conservatively (there have been reports of a number of patients with spontaneous regression). Antiviral treatment with acyclovir, ganciclovir and cidofovir has yielded disappointing results. 4, 33 For EBVassociated HLH with severe evolution, the introduction of immunochemotherapy has dramatically changed the history and prognosis of the disease. With the combined use of the HLH-04 protocol and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (for refractory cases or recurrence), the survival rate for EBV-associated HLH has drastically improved. 34, 35 In an international registry, the addition of rituximab to anti-HLH treatment (steroids, etoposide and/or cyclosporine) was well tolerated and improved the clinical situation in 43% of patients. 21 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other herpes viruses: The viruses most commonly associated with HLH after EBV are the cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8). 2, 18 CMV activates the expression of the tumor necrosis factor gene and has been associated with HLH in healthy patients, with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatic diseases, cancer and transplantation, with a very high mortality rate. 3, 10, 36 In a series of 171 patients who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, 7 patients developed HLH, with CMV the trigger in 3 of these cases. 2, 16, 37 Younger ages are associated with a poorer prognosis. 2, 11, 38 The specific anti-CMV treatment (anti-CMV immunoglobulin, foscarnet or ganciclovir) can be effective. 12, 39 There have been reports of HLH associated with HHV-8 infection in children and adults. The majority of the cases occurred in patients with Kaposi or multicentric Castleman disease, especially in patients with HIV infection 40, 41 and, more rarely, in immunocompetent patients. 42, 43 This condition has a high mortality rate, and better treatment results have been reported with foscarnet, etoposide and rituximab. 13, 43 Herpes simplex viral infections are responsible for 30% of neonatal HLH cases in Japan (6 of every 20 patients with neonatal HLH), with a high mortality rate (4 of 6 patients). 13, 44 A few isolated cases have been described in adults. 13, 45 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): HLH can be associated with HIV infection. It is likely that this association has been underestimated, given the clinical and laboratory result similarities between HIV infection and HLH. Approximately 10%-20% of bone marrow biopsies of HIV-positive patients show signs of hemophagocytosis before the start of antiretroviral treatment. 13, 14, 46 Opportunistic infections or neoplasms can be observed in cases of acute or chronic HIV infection and associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (associated with the start of antiretroviral treatment). 2,47 HLH can also be the initial presentation of HIV infection. Other common viral triggers of HLH in patients with HIV are EBV, CMV and HHV-8. In a recent series, 55% of patients presented HLH-T (especially lymphomas), and 41% were associated with underlying infections (especially herpes virus and tuberculosis infections). The series had a mortality rate of approximately 30% (similar in HLH-I and HLH-T), whether the patients underwent specific treatment for the HLH or not. 16, 47 A number of authors have related CMV infection to HLH associated with HIV infection and recommend starting with anti-CMV treatment (ganciclovir or foscarnet) in these cases. 2, 23 Other viruses: HLH have also been associated, but less frequently, with other viruses including the influenza virus, parvovirus B19, hepatotropic viruses, enteroviruses, paramyxovirus (measles and mumps), rubella virus, adenovirus, human parainfluenza virus, flavivirus (dengue) and hantavirus (hemorrhagic fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome). 6,35",

The patient was diagnosed with EBV-associated HLH, and, due to the severity of the symptoms, treatment was started with the HLH-04 protocol.
