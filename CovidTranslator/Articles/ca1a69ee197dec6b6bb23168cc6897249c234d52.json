In theory, sense-specific measurement of viral RNAs may be achieved by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays which utilize primers of defined polarity during the RT step. However, in practice, it has been shown that such assays are prone to artifacts, such as non-specific priming, which drastically diminish their reliability. Using murine coronavirus MHV-4 as a model, we describe and validate several modifications of the RT-PCR procedure which eliminate these artifacts. Key RT-PCR parameters which were optimized include the design of tagged primers, DNase treatment of in vitro transcribed RNA standards, specification of temperature differences between RT and PCR annealing steps, and use of competitive RNA templates for quantitative assays. The assays described may be used to determine the sense and abundance of any viral or host RNA of interest in complex biological specimens.",

For example, in the case of viruses with a RNA genome, the presence of RNAs of antigenomic sense usually indicates active viral transcription. In other studies, in which viral gene expression appears altered, it would be informative to determine whether this change is correlated with corresponding alterations in the level of pos-itive or negative sense viral RNA. A striking change in the expected relative or absolute abundance of viral RNA of a given sense may provide clues as to the mode of viral replication in vitro or of viral pathogenesis in vivo.",

However, in many experiments, particularly with samples obtained in vivo, viral RNA may not be of sufficiently high concentration to allow detection by this technique. Clearly, RT-PCR assays provide high sensitivity (approximately 3-4 logs more than Northern blot or nuclease protection assays) (Foley et al., 1993; Ausubel et al., 1994; K\u00f6 hler et al., 1995) and are widely used to detect trace amounts of viral RNA in many experiments. In theory, it should be straightforward to assay for viral RNAs of a given sense by using a primer of defined polarity in the RT step of the procedure. For example, if the RT step is primed by an oligonucleotide which binds negative sense viral RNA, cDNA should be produced for subsequent PCR amplification if and only if viral templates of negative sense are present in the original specimen; if negative sense viral RNA is not present, the reaction should be aborted at the RT step, and theoretically no PCR amplification products will be produced.",

For example, in control assays using defined hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA templates, Lanford et al. (1994) demonstrated that an RT-PCR product could be obtained with the 'incorrect' sense RT primer or even in the absence of any primer in the RT step. They hypothesized that artifacts arose through a combination of factors, including false priming of the incorrect strand by the RT primer, self-priming of the viral RNA template at regions of secondary structure, and random priming by contaminating or irrelevant nucleic acids. Similarly, Gunji et al. (1994) , also working with HCV, showed that conventional RT-PCR assays were not able to reliably detect viral positive and nega-tive sense RNAs in samples which contained cellular RNAs. These investigators suggested that fragmented cellular RNAs were able to prime viral templates, giving rise to unreliable results.",

Recently, Lerat et al., (1996) demonstrated that even optimized protocols artifactually detect negative sense HCV RNA when these assays are applied to clinical samples.

We describe potential pitfalls of sensespecific RT-PCR assays (ssRT-PCR), as well as techniques introduced by other investigators (Chaves et al., 1994; Lanford et al., 1994; Lerat et al., 1996) and our laboratory to circumvent these artifacts. Finally, the addition of competitor RNA templates to the assay allowed the ssRT-PCR to be performed quantitatively (qssRT-PCR).

After 2 h of incubation, RNA templates were obtained from each reaction by three extractions with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (125:24:1, pH 4.7). Subsequently, RNA was precipitated by adjusting NH 4 OAc to 2 M, fol-lowed by the addition of 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. After a wash in 75% ethanol, the RNA pellet was resuspended in 25 ml DEPC-treated water. In order to inactivate any residual plasmid template, the RNA suspension was then subjected to a reaction in a 50 ml volume containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM MnCl 2 , 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mM DTT, 10 U RNasin (Promega), and 10 U DNase I (Promega). After a 1-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the reaction was terminated by three extractions with phenol:choloroform:isoamyl alcohol (125:24:1, pH 4.7), followed by ethanol precipitation. The RNA pellet was then resuspended in 25 ml 2mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and quantitated by absorbency at 260 nm, as well as by comparison to RNA standards on formaldehyde gels (Promega). RNA was then mixed with two volumes of 100% ethanol, and NaCl was added to achieve a final concentration of 100 mM, after which the sample was stored at \u2212 70\u00b0C. a Oligonucleotides were used to prime templates corresponding to the N gene of MHV-4 (Genbank database accession number K00757). The irrelevant or tag marker sequences correspond to gene 3 (3a protein and coat protein) of the plant virus cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) (Genbank database accession number M28818), control plasmids for which were generously provided by Dr Paul Ahlquist, University of Wisconsin, Madison. Please see text for detailed description of overlap primer use. b All sequences correspond to gene N of MHV-4, unless marked with an asterisk, in which case they correspond to gene 3 of CCMV. In most primers, short non-viral sequences were added at the 5% end to create restriction sites and facilitate cloning. c Nucleotides which are italicized are non-viral sequences encoding restriction endonuclease recognition sites to facilitate cloning of RT-PCR products. These sequences are, respectively, Hind III (AM8-1), Kpn I (AM8-2), EcoR I (AM8-3), BamH I (AM8-4), and Bgl II (AM8-B and AM8-C). ",

Serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed RNA N-del templates of either positive or negative sense were amplified with specific primers. The optimized ssRT-PCR could detect approximately 1.0 fg of positive sense or negative sense N-del template, either in the pres-ence (Fig. 2 ) or absence (data not shown) of 1 mg of total cellular RNA derived from uninfected DBT cells. Also, we found that the assay for positive sense or negative sense coronavirus RNA did not yield a product when 10 5 fg of the opposite or 'wrong' sense was added to the reaction (Fig. 2) . However, when 10 6 fg of the inappropriate RNA template was added to the reaction, a non-specific product was detected (data not shown), indicating that the assay has a maximal differential amplification capacity of approximately 100 000-fold with regard to detection of a specific RNA template relative to an excess of inappropriate or opposite sense RNA template. Fig. 3 , when compared to Fig. 2 , indicates that the inhibition of specific RNA detection in the presence of an excess of wrong sense RNA is insignificant. Finally, in pilot experiments, we have been able to extend the sensitivity of the ssRT-PCR to the attogram (approximately 10 MHV-4 RNA molecules) range by means of nested PCR (Zazzi et al., 1993) methodology using primers AM8-3 and AM8-4 (data not shown); in this case, it is essential in each experiment to include controls of sense specificity, e.g. a control reaction demonstrating the non-amplification of an appropriate concentration of wrong sense RNA.",

An example of this assay is shown in Fig. 4 . The assay for positive sense viral RNA was conducted in the pg range and the negative sense assay conducted in the fg range on the basis of published studies and pilot experiments showing that positive sense coronavirus RNA is in vast excess in most infections. Additional bands were sometimes observed during competitive reactions (Fig.  4) ; these bands likely represent heteroduplexes (Schneeberger et al., 1995) and were not of sufficient magnitude to interfere with quantification. During densitometric analyses, bands corresponding to heteroduplexes were ignored, as these spe-cies would be expected to detract from the intensity of both competitor (MHV-4 and N-del) RNAs equally. Three assays were performed by standard curve methodology on separate days ( Table 2) . As indicated, the coefficients of variation for the positive sense and negative sense assays were 3.0 and 5.7%, respectively. Similar reproducibility was obtained with RNAs obtained from mouse brains during chronic pathogenesis studies and with RNAs derived from infected tissue cultures (data not shown). Rock (1994) indicates that 'where an accepted standard with a known and agreed upon quantitative result exists, accuracy can be operationally defined as the difference between the measured value of the standard and the value assigned to the standard'. We initially assessed the accuracy of the qssRT-PCR by carefully determining the concentrations of RNA template stocks by UV absorbency and comparison to commercial RNA standards. Reference standards of positive and negative sense N-wt with an assigned value of 10.0 fg were then prepared and tested in the qssRT-PCR using equimolar methodology in competitions against N-del. The measured values for N-wt standards were 10.2 and 16.5 fg for positive and negative sense templates respectively (versus 10.0 fg, the expected result in a perfect assay, assuming perfect quantification of input RNA stocks against commercial RNA standards).",

Using equimolar methodology, qssRT-PCR showed that at maximal infection 12 h after inoculation, FL5 cells contained 0.86 ng or 2.7\u00d7 10 9 molecules of RNA competing with N-del template per microgram of total cellular RNA and, further, that \\99% of the MHV-4 RNA was of positive sense (data not shown).

While RT-PCR in theory should provide the requisite specificity and sensitivity for these determinations, our initial, exploratory experiments showed that conventional RT-PCR assays for viral RNAs were not sensespecific, let alone quantitative, findings which were concordant with those of previous investigators (Willems et al., 1993) . In this regard, most RT-PCR protocols are primarily designed to optimize sensitivity rather than discrimination with regard to RNA template amplification. In other words, in most applications, low levels of amplification of non-specific products are acceptable and do not detract from the primary purpose of the assay, which is efficient detection of the RNA of interest. By contrast, in ssRT-PCR specificity is the over-riding consideration, since the aim of the assay is unambiguous detection of an RNA of a given sense, often under circumstances in which the RNA is orders of magnitude less abundant than an RNA species of the opposite sense (e.g. Table 2 ). In this case, assay parameters must be such that non-amplification of incorrect sense RNA templates is virtually absolute, since any amplification of the incorrect sense RNA, however infrequent, will be geometrically expanded during PCR and may easily lend to invalid results.",

In our experience, the use of tagged oligonucleotide primers (Chaves et al., 1994; Lanford et al., 1994) was more practical and effective than other proposed specificity-enhancing measures, such as chemical modification of RNA templates (Gunji et al., 1994) or the use of thermostable enzymes, such as rTth DNA polymerase, in both RT and PCR steps (Lanford et al., 1994) . The key features of our optimized assay are listed in Table 3 . We have found that careful attention to each of these parameters is imperati6e in order to maintain sense-specificity and consistent quantification in the ssRT-PCR. Essentially, during ssRT-PCR there are numerous opportunities for artifacts, and if reliable results are to be obtained, stringent precautions must be taken at every step of the procedure to avoid these artifacts. Furthermore, control samples should be run with every assay in order to be certain that non-specific amplification has not occurred.

Pilot experiments demonstrated that symmetrical primers with low PCR annealing temperatures gave rise to non-specific products (data not shown). However, a Results are expressed in pg of positive sense or fg of negative sense MHV-4 RNA corresponding to the N-wt amplimer/mg of total brain RNA obtained from a mouse 4 days after viral inoculation intracerebrally. Three experiments done by standard curve methodology on separate days are shown, and the results are expressed as the mean and standard deviation (S.D.) for the three assays, as well coefficient of variation (CV) for positive and negative qssRT-PCR assays. Table 3 Key features of the optimized quantitative sense-specific RT-PCR which affect assay performance in the optimized assay, the RT step is performed at 48\u00b0C, close to the melting temperature (TM) of anti-viral sequences of our RT primers, and the PCR annealing step, which depends on longer tag:anti-tag sequence interactions, is set at 65\u00b0C. Thus, both the RT and PCR phases of our assay are each conducted under conditions of high stringency, at the threshold at which specific primers are able to anneal correctly to specific templates; in this case, the high stringency in both phases of the assay strongly inhibits non-specific priming. Another advantage of asymmetrical primers relates to carryover of hybrid RT primers into the PCR phase of the assay. In reported assays in which the anti-viral and tag sequences of the hybrid primers are both approximately 16 -18 nucleotides, resulting in RT reaction and PCR annealing temperatures which are close to each other, hybrid RT primers are available and can anneal during the PCR phase of the assay. This availability may result in multiple rounds of cumulative non-specific priming during the PCR, for example, of hybrid primers to aberrant viral RNAs, prior mis-primed products, or to plasmidderived DNA (in the case of in vitro transcribed RNA standards). In the optimized PCR described, primers carried over from the RT step into the PCR steps are unlikely to misprime, since PCR annealing occurs at temperatures which exceed the TM of viral:anti-viral template:primer interactions but are optimal for specific binding of longer tag:anti-tag sequences. Also, during the PCR phase of the assay, the primers for this step are at 20-fold molar excess relative to primers carried over from the RT step. This discrepancy puts primers from the RT step at a further relative disadvantage during the PCR steps and favors specific tag:anti-tag interactions during the PCR.",

            "text": "A third methodological consideration relates to the requirement that the specificity of ssRT-PCR assays must be tested with control RNA templates of known sense. Typically, such RNA standards are transcribed in vitro from DNA plasmids. Paradoxically, these control RNA template preparations may introduce artifacts which are not present in actual experimental or clinical samples. For example, traces of plasmid DNA, obviously containing strands of both positive and negative sense, virtually always contaminate RNAs which are transcribed in vitro by conventional protocols; in this case, strand specificity cannot be demonstrated since control reagents themselves are contaminated by sequences of the 'wrong' sense. In order to overcome this problem, it is essential after in vitro transcription of RNA standards to digest the plasmid template with high concentrations of RNase-free DNase in a buffer containing Mn (Bauer et al., 1997) (Table 3) . Conventional DNase treatments in Mg-containing buffers did not completely degrade plasmid DNA (data not shown). In our experience, when non-specific products are observed during ssRT-PCR, trouble shooting usually reveals that this artifact is caused by trace contamination of control RNA reagents by residual plasmid DNA. This problem may be corrected by either producing new batches of RNA standards or by repeated DNase treatment of existing RNA standards. Also, the conditions of our RT-PCR assay minimize the possibility of amplification of residual, contaminating plasmid DNA in two other ways. First, during the RT step at 48\u00b0C plasmid DNA templates are likely to remain double-stranded and thus are unavailable for amplification. Second, during the PCR step, only primers recognizing tag sequences introduced into prior products will prime Taq polymerase (Fig. 1) ; therefore, carryover plasmid DNA, having exclusively viral sequences and lacking tag sequences, will not be amplified.",

However, improved methodology and rigorous control of reactions have permitted unambiguous quantitative PCR and RT-PCR determinations with good correspondence to values obtained with established standard methods, such as Northern blot (Wang et al., 1989; Yokoi, et al., 1993) . In fact, the reliability of RT-PCR and similar techniques is such that quantitative assays have been approved for routine clinical use, for example, in determining HIV-1 mRNA levels in patients during antiretroviral chemotherapy (Saag, 1997) . In this regard, once the ssRT-PCR assay was optimized, it was relatively straightforward to extend the method to quantitative determinations by adding competitor RNA templates to the reactions. Relative to viral sequences, such competitor RNAs have identical primer binding sites but contain a small deletion which allows specific products generated from these templates to be distinguished on sizing gels. The power of competitive RT-PCR assays is derived from the fact that the sample and competitor RNA templates are amplified in the same reaction tube under identical conditions. Assaying both templates in one tube eliminates sources of error which may occur when control and experimental templates are amplified in separate tubes and subsequently compared to each other.",

In our assays of coronavirus RNA by qssRT-PCR, we have found that both the equimolar format and standard curve format work well and have similar sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and practicability (data not shown). We have found it easiest to use the qssRT-PCR in the equimolar mode during initial experiments, when the magnitude of expected coronavirus RNA concentration is unknown. By contrast, the standard curve method has been most convenient at later stages of experiments, when the approximate range of coronavirus RNA concentrations may be anticipated and many replicate samples in this range must be analyzed.

The sense and quantity of any viral RNA may be reliably determined if strict attention is given to controls and to the methodological points listed in Table 3 . The assay has been demonstrated to have excellent sensitivity, specificity, and precision, with almost no interference by irrelevant or opposite-sense RNAs. It is more difficult to assess the accuracy, defined as freedom from systematic analytical error or correspondence to a true value (Rock, 1994) , of the qssRT-PCR assay we have presented, especially when purified, exactly-quantified standards of genuine viral RNA are not available. The experiments presented demonstrate reasonably accurate assay performance with a variety of conditions and standards, including competitions against RNA obtained during viral infection in vitro. We suspect that the degree of inaccuracy observed, particularly in the case of negative sense N-wt determinations, is due principally to small errors in measuring the concentrations of our initial RNA template stock solutions. In many applications it may be sufficient to determine if a given viral RNA species is increasing or decreasing relative to a baseline or standard value during the course of an experiment. If, on the other hand, it is essential to know the concentration of a viral RNA in absolute terms, for example, to rigorously determine the average number of viral genomes per infected cell, then additional efforts must be made to precisely measure the concentration of competitor RNA standards, followed by careful titration of these standards in competitions against actual viral RNAs under realistic experimental conditions.",
