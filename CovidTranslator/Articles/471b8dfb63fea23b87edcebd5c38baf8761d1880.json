Similarly labeled human poliovirus 1 (PO 1), which is not specifically retained by porcine tissue, was used as a control. The explant procedure employed could maintain ileal tissue in a differentiated state for up to 48 hours. Porcine ileum was acquired from both young (4-6 week-old) and adult (9-11 month-old) animals. Inoculated explants of either absorptive or lymphoid tissue were incubated at temperatures selected to permit either viral adsorption or penetration and elution to occur. Retention of radioactive virus was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting and localized by autoradiography. Only in absorptive tissue explants from young animals did adsorption of CB 5 at 6 \u00b0C exceed penetration at 37 \u00b0C. This suggested that incubation at 6 \u00b0C may not be an appropriate condition for studying enterovirus adsorption in explants. CB 5 penetrated most efficiently into lymphoid tissue explants from young animals, indicating that these tissues could discriminate between CB 5 and PO 1. In explants from adults, CB 5 penetrated equally well into lymphoid and absorptive tissues. Virus penetrated into the absorptive epithelial cells and, possibly, the lamina propria near the villous tips. Low efficiency of penetration, and the non-critical function of these target cells, may help account for the characteristic lack of gastrointestinal symptoms in enterovirus infections.",

Lymphoid tissue retained considerably more virus at 37 \u00b0C than at 6 \u00b0C (with the unexplained exception of PO 1 retention in young pigs). Similarly, virus adsorption and penetration into absorptive tissue explants were equivalent in all cases except for the interaction between CB 5 and tissues from young pigs.

This result was not surprising, since both the amount of radioactivity in the inocula and the efficiency of virus retention by explants were low. Retention of radioactive virus was detected as small groups of silver grains (generally 3-15 grains) associated with the tissue. Background was recognized as individual grains randomly distributed through the tissue and in the emulsion not overlying the tissue. Under optimal conditions, tissue sections exposed for 2-4 days were almost totally free of background grains. Silver grains associated with dust, mucus, or knife marks in the section were considered artifactual and disregarded. In some instances, silver grains were clearly deposited within the cytoplasm of mucosal cells. Significantly, this was only observed in tissues incubated at 37 \u00b0C.

It was not possible to determine whether one region contained substantially more grains than the other. Additionally, there was no evidence of silver grains within the lamina propria, even in those instances where the integrity of the villus had been compromised, such as where the mucosal layer had been torn. Absorptive tissue incubated with PO 1 exhibited fewer grains than if incubated with CB 5. As expected, those present were dispersed as individual grains rather than in groups. Lymphoid tissue explants incubated with CB 5 showed accumulations of silver grains at the epithelial layer that were comparable in size and number to those seen in sections of absorptive tissue (Fig. 5 ). Since it is not possible to distinguish the different mucosal cell types of the Peyer's patches with a light microscope, the identity of these receptor cells could not be determined.

This result indicated a high degree of specificity, since these tissues could discriminate between two morphologically similar viruses. Specialized epithelial cells of the Peyer's patches (M cells) are believed to sample the antigens present in the lumen of the intestine and present them to the lymphocytes. Selection of antigens is generally thought to be nonspecific. Substances retained by M cells include ferritin [1] , horseradish peroxidase [22] , and carbon particles [13] . Reoviruses, known to penetrate into the intestinal epithelium via the M cells [31] did not interact with M cells specifically [30] . However, penetration of reoviruses into other epithelial cells was virus-specific: reovirus 1 interacted with absorptive cells overlying lymphoid tissue but not those covering ileal villi. In our study, CB 5 may have been retained both nonspecifically by M cells and specifically by the absorptive ceils of the lymphoid tissue. In constrast, PO 1 uptake may only have been the result of nonspecific interaction with the M cells. This hypothesis could be tested by autoradiography using electron microscopy.",

First, only a small proportion of ileal tissue interacted with virus. This was reflected in the low efficiency of CB 5 penetration and the infrequency of silver deposits indicating viral presence in autoradiographs. Second, the autoradiographs implicated the aging mucosal cells and/or cells of the lamina propria as the most probable sites of virus penetration and, presumably, replication. These cells play a minor role in the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients. Any loss of intestinal function due to virus replication is therefore unlikely to cause intestinal disease. Third, the infected cells apparently produced a low number of progeny viruses [10] . Furthermore, the prolonged period of virus shedding could be explained by the large number of potentially susceptible cells and the rapid renewal rate of the mucosal cells (about 5 days in humans). Varying rates of cell replacement may also help account for the distinction seen between young and adult animals. Because the mitotic rate is slower in younger animals, aging epithelial cells stay attached to the villi longer. It is also possible that porcine mucosal cells of different ages produce varying amounts enterovirus, as has been suggested for transmissible gastroenteritis virus [20] .",
