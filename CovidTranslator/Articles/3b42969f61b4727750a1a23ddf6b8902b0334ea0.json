No preference in time of day to deliver has been observed, but if disturbed, the ewe may stop labor for a few minutes until settled again. Normal presentation of the lamb is described as anterior dorsosacral with front limbs extended and preceding the nose by approximately 6 cm (2 to 4 inches). Also normal but associated with greater risk to the safe delivery of the lamb is posterior dorsosacral with hind limbs extended. If delivery is delayed and the umbilical cord is compressed between the lamb and the pelvis of the ewe, the lamb may suffocate before delivery is complete.

Mouth-to-nose resuscitation should not be done because of the risk of contracting a zoonotic infection from the lamb, such as Chlamydophila abortus or Coxiella burnetii infection. A technique of inflating the lungs that has been used with some success is as follows: A lamb stomach tube is inserted into the esophagus of the lamb. By means of gentle pressure applied with a thumb and forefinger, the esophagus is closed off distal to the end of the tube. The other hand is used to close off the mouth and nostrils. The clinician softly blows once into the tube. With the esophagus closed off, the air will be forced down the trachea into the lungs. The tube is removed after delivery of one breath, and the lamb is reassessed.",

A low udder or an udder covered with wool, or pendulous, misshapen teats, will interfere with successful nursing. The licking also serves to provide olfactory stimulation to aid in maternal recognition of the lamb. This bonding generally occurs in the first hour after birth. It is critical that the ewe have an undisturbed opportunity to bond with her lambs, without the risk of attempts at stealing them by another ewe.

Total atelectasis of the lungs indicates that the lamb never breathed. The trachea and bronchi should be opened to examine for aspiration pneumonia (the owner may have incorrectly passed a stomach tube). \u2022 The tongue, diaphragm, and heart should be sectioned and examined for evidence of white muscle disease. The heart should be checked for congenital defects. \u2022 The abomasum should be examined for type and quantity of content. An empty abomasum or an abomasum that contains dirt or grass, along with the finding of serous atrophy of fat, suggests that the lamb survived at least 5 hours but never nursed. Detection of milkfat in the mesenteric lymphatics suggests that several hours have passed since feeding. \u2022 The skull and the brain, particularly the atlantooccipital region, should be examined for hemorrhages, both subdural and throughout the brain, indicating the possibility of birth trauma. \u2022 The joints all should be opened to look for evidence of septic arthritis.",

            "text": "It is important to instruct the producer on how to recognize a sick lamb and how to apply appropriate nursing care. Hypothermia and hypoglycemia are the most common causes of lamb mortality; if recognized early, both are responsive to treatment. Affected lambs initially are hunched up and empty-appearing. If the problems are not detected early, these lambs will become recumbent. If in sternal position, the lamb may rise but appears depressed and slow to respond. Eventually, the lamb is laterally recumbent and comatose. Figure 91 -5 presents an algorithm for treatment for a lamb suspected of suffering from hypothermia or hypoglycemia. The client should be instructed in proper technique for tube feeding, with specific measures to avoid aspiration pneumonia: The client sits with the lamb on his or her lap, holding the lamb's head and neck gently in the nondominant arm. The tube is introduced slowly into the mouth and gently pushed toward the back of the throat. If the lamb sucks on the tube, a swallowing reflex is encouraged. Once the tube has been swallowed, the client can feel it pass down the lamb's neck in the esophagus. This maneuver should be practiced several times until the client can recognize the feel of the rubber end passing the fingers. If the tube enters the trachea, it cannot be felt externally. Premeasurement of the tube will help the client to determine if the tube has reached the abomasum. If the lamb coughs, the tube is withdrawn and another attempt is made. Colostrum can be fed by syringe or squeeze bottle. The dose of 50 ml/kg of body weight should be fed slowly over 5 to 10 minutes, so that the abomasum does not overfill, leading to regurgitation. The client is instructed to kink the tube before withdrawal to prevent aspiration of milk. Many ways to warm a lamb have been described. Immersion in warm water is the most rapid but requires that the client hold the lamb while in water and then dry it immediately, to avoid chilling from evaporation. Placement in a warming box in which the lamb lies on a grate that allows warm air to circulate around it generally works the best (Fig. 91-6) . A household hair dryer works well for this purpose. Air temperature should not exceed 41\u00b0C. A warming pad will accomplish the same thing if the lamb also is covered with a blanket and turned frequently. Least efficient is use of a heat lamp, which offers only radiant heat to the exposed part of the lamb.",

In outbreaks of pneumonia, metaphylaxis has been used with success.

Other antimicrobials that may be effective but are not licensed for sheep include long-acting oxytetracycline and florfenicol (Nuflor \u2021 ). Generally, antimicrobial resistance is not a reason for treatment failure. Most often the reason is failure to detect sick animals soon enough or not treating for long enough. It is important to train the client to observe nursing lambs carefully for depression.
