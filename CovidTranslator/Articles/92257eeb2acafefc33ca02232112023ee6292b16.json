Objectives: In this paper, the aim was to map the scientific research on public health in Rwanda after the genocide and to present the links between different financing systems. Methods: We used bibliographic analyses with Web of Science of papers published during the period 1975-2014. We performed analyses on journals, most cited articles, authors, publication years, organizations, funding companies, countries, and keywords. Results: We obtained 86 articles between 1975 and 2014. Most articles were published after 2007. The main countries of research laboratories were the United States of America, Rwanda, England and Belgium and represented the main network collaboration. The relevant keywords were: HIV, woman, child, program, rural and violence. Conclusions: Public health research on Rwanda appeared 14 years after the genocide. A main field was emerging: the spread of HIV with mother-child transmission, and the policies to take this subject into account in rural zones. The network of institutions developing these studies was USA-Rwanda.",

In few months, ethnic mass slaughters occurred in all parts of the country.The rebuilding has remained incomplete because of the gigantic tasks in different areas. One of the major areas is public health. In fact, public health represented the needs and demands about population 2 . In low-income countries, public health systems were not suitable to population need; therefore, after genocide and the efforts to rebuild the healthcare structures, the task seemed a major one 3 . Public health covered different fields such as infectiology 4 , parasitology 5 , mental health 6 , organization of the centers and financing movements 7 . After 2008, the World Health Organization presented several programs on public health in Rwanda 8 . After 2010, the main objectives were the fight against HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, the fight against the transmission mother-child 8 , corresponding to the Millennium Development Goals 4-6 .",

It seems clear that the current policies are not involved in such a field. Only four records on 86 put forward mental health. Mental health is clearly a burning issue for researchers in neighboring countries as Uganda. The studies deal with the impact of war in psychiatric problems and also with the impact of disease [19] [20] . It could be explained by an historical and political points of view. In fact, in order to rebuild the country, the most urgent was not the psychiatric concerns.

Article on the same subject was published after 200715 and corresponded to the Millennium Developmental Goal 6 (combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases). Nevertheless, most of the records were after 2007. It has taken more than one decade after genocide to see interest in Rwandan public health. Moreover, the last few years (from 2010 up to now) are the most relevant for publichealth studies. The limitations on publishing and research cannot be only attributed to genocide. Because only one study was published before genocide, it means that structures concerning public health were not created before 1994. The genocide didn't allowed researches to create these structures until the end of the 2000's. It means that most areas of public health and especially those related to Millenium development Goals 4 to 6 are showing an increasing dominance in publication.",
