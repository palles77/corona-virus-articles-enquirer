Mitigating fear and discrimination directed toward persons infected with, and affected by, infectious disease can be important in controlling transmission. Persons who are feared and stigmatized may delay seeking care and remain in the community undetected. This article outlines efforts to rapidly assess, monitor, and address fears associated with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in the United States. Although fear, stigmatization, and discrimination were not widespread in the general public, Asian-American communities were particularly affected.",

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) illustrates these difficulties. SARS spontaneously appeared in the southern province of Guangdong, People's Republic of China, in November 2002 (1, 2) . By July 2003, the epidemic, had spread to more than 30 countries with 8,427 cumulative probable cases and 916 deaths and was identified as a global threat to health (1) . In the United States, 418 cases were reported with 74 classified as probable SARS; no deaths occurred (1) . As with many disease outbreaks, scientific information and data related to the disease changed almost hourly, as public health scientists and practitioners responded to the worldwide outbreak, which was coupled with widespread fear (3, 4) .",

Headlines from the English-language press heightened the fear. \"Concern is mounting over the continuing spread of the deadly SARS virus. Some experts say it could have a similar impact to the 1918 flu epidemic that killed 50 million-or the current world HIV crisis,\" wrote the British Broadcasting Corporation from London, England (6) . \"China has threatened to execute or jail for life anyone who deliberately spreads the killer SARS virus,\" stated the Cable News Network from Beijing, China (7) .",

This strategy works best as a complement to a larger public health education and communication campaign. Typically during outbreaks, initial risk communication is targeted to frontline public health professionals through vehicles such as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Initial communication provides information on case definitions and laboratory-testing strategies, as well as interim guidelines for infection control and other critical issues. Communication strategies for the general public most frequently involve television sound bites, press conferences with dignitaries and health officials, and targeted release of information to mass media outlets such as newspapers and Internet sites (14) . Although these risk communication activities are critical for keeping the general public informed during an outbreak, they can fail to meet the personal needs of the affected population and the general public.",

Passive data collection of SARS fear-related concerns began on April 29, 2003. During May 2003, 7,327 SARS-related calls were received; 4,013 (54.7%) of these calls were pas-sively sampled. Of these sampled calls, an average of 10% of callers expressed concerns related to fear, stigmatization, and discrimination. A caller could express more than one concern. Major concerns included the following: fear of buying Asian merchandise (187 calls); working with Asians (83 calls); living near Asians (45 calls); going to school with Asians (41 calls); and more generic issus such as being on a cruise ship or airplane (77 calls); and church, school, or workplace issues (65 calls).

Team members monitored English-language and Asian-language electronic, print, and television media coverage and informal chat rooms in the United States and other countries to stay abreast of changing information about the nature of the SARS outbreak that could influence fear, stigmatization, and discrimination. The assessment showed that many people within the Asian-American community were getting information from Asian-language newspapers, television, and Internet sites directly from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other Asian areas-usually hours ahead of information providers in the United States. The information provided by these Asian-language sources was often inconsistent with newspaper, television, and Internet coverage in the United States, thus creating fear and suspicion that the United States government might not be telling the truth about the outbreak in this country. Independent contentanalysis research conducted by InterTrend Communications (San Francisco, CA) compared four of the most popular Chinese language newspapers in the United States with two popular national mainstream English-language newspapers from March 21 to April 3, 2003 (15) . InterTrend data showed that 1) Chinese-language newspapers were more likely to highlight SARS news related to the Chinese community in the United States or from China more prominently than mainstream Englishlanguage newspapers; and 2) Chinese-language newspapers were more likely to have articles on SARS, including featured in-depth articles, than mainstream English-language U.S. national newspapers (15). These findings supported the team's initial assessment (based on an informal convenience sample of Asian-language papers).",

The main messages for people in the United States were the following: 1) the risk of SARS is low; 2) severe cases of SARS have been uncommon, and there have been no deaths in the United States; 3) methods for disease prevention in the general public are like those of other viral diseases; and 4) although no evidence of community spread currently exists, continued vigilance, aggressive case management, and infection control are needed.",

Speakers also presented a public health model for mitigating fear, stigmatization, and discrimination that could be instituted by public health officials, clinicians, and community members. Through open discussion sessions and informal information gathering in the community, the team found that SARS-related stigmatization was occurring more frequently within the Asian community than from outsiders directed toward the Asian community. The team also found that those persons with SARS-like symptoms who used traditional herbal physicians and pharmacies were less likely to be referred to, or seek out, public health officials, suggesting that further research into strategies to reach this population is needed.

More recently, stigmatization associated with fear and the AIDS epidemic negatively influenced voluntary testing, counseling, and treatment of those infected with the disease (21) . Health providers have also seen reluctance by recent refugees and immigrants to get tested and treated for tuberculosis because of possible social stigmatization (22) .
