We amplified the conserved regions of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of 438 clinical specimens using real-time RT-PCR assay for rapid identification of pandemic influenza virus. The real-time RT-PCR was optimized and the primers and probes were tested against a panel of known negative and positive controls. RNA isolated from the HeLa cell line served as quality control. The conventional RT-PCR which is an established method of influenza virus diagnosis was compared to realtime RT-PCR. Of 438 clinical specimens tested, 212 specimens were found positive for influenza A virus (SD 46.669) in which 139 specimens were diagnosed positive for the pandemic 2009 H1N1 while 73 were the seasonal influenza viruses. We report that the real-time RT-PCR assay offers both, a high sensitivity and specificity when compared with the traditional identification method. The real-time RT-PCR assay allows rapid identification of the pandemic swine 2009-H1N1 at very low viral loads that are negative by the traditional RT-PCR. This optimized assay can be a very useful tool to assist both epidemiologists and the clinicians.",

These viruses are well known for the worldwide pandemics and epidemics [4, 8, 9] causing morbidity and mortality in individuals of all age groups, especially the elderly and the patients with chronic disabilities [5, 15] . The segmented nature of the viral genome permits gene reassortment events, which cause antigenic shifts for which there is no immunity in the population and also leads to development of new host range (facilitating pandemics) [6, 8] . After the three major pandemics during the twentieth century i.e. Spanish flu in 1918, Asian flu in 1957 and Hong Kong flu in 1968-1969 [7, 13, 14] , the novel swine 2009-H1N1 virus has recently spread internationally with such an unprecedented speed that the WHO escalated its pandemic alert from Phase 5 to Phase 6 on June 11, 2009 [16] .",

India reported its first laboratory diagnosed swine H1N1 case in May 2009 while the first death due to 2009-H1NI was reported in August 2009 [9] . Control of the spread of disease relies on rapid diagnosis and appropriate clinical management. Early and reliable detection of the swine flu in clinical specimens will determine which patients, presenting with fever, should be immediately isolated and managed according to strict procedures of infection control. Several methods are available to diagnose influenza virus infection including rapid tests for the viral antigen present in the nasal and throat swabs or the naso-pharyngeal aspirates, immunofluorescence (IF) [1, 10] and virus RNA isolation followed by PCR. Real-time RT PCR is the latest gold standard for diagnosis of the novel pandemic swine 2009-H1N1 virus. Real-time RT-PCR assays for influenza virus using TaqMan-based probes have been recommended by WHO for the diagnosis of the currently circulating pandemic swine 2009-H1N1 virus [3] .",

The primers and probes recommended by WHO is a reliable identification method used for the detection of the pandemic swine 2009-H1N1 virus in the clinical samples taken from the suspected patients. Unlike traditional RT-PCR, the real-time RT-PCR assay not only reduces the risk for contamination but also reduces turnaround time to 1-2 h. CT values of less than 25 showed a very high correlation with positive results obtained using the viral nucleic acid by the conventional PCR. Further, a Ct of less than 20 had a specificity that approached 100% for the swine 2009-H1N1 virus as well as seasonal influenza viruses. This indicates that the realtime RT-PCR assay can be used to reliably confirm the presence of influenza viruses in patients that test positive by traditional methods. In the current study, 48.40% of the samples tested positive by the real-time RT-PCR assay while the traditional PCR detected only 42.46% thereby showing the superior sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR assay. The analysis of the patients found positive for swine 2009-H1N1 and seasonal influenza A revealed that patients in 5-24 years age group were more vulnerable to pandemic swine 2009-H1N1 virus while the seasonal influenza virus showed no specific pattern. The probable reason for less infection in the elderly population could be cross preventive effect of the antibodies developed against the circulating seasonal influenza A viruses. This argues that the vaccination of the youngsters from 5 to 24 age groups against the pandemic virus is indeed urgent. Another important observation was that males as opposed to females were found to be more susceptible with a ratio of 1.641:1 and 1.259:1 for swine 2009-H1N1 and seasonal influenza viruses, respectively.",
