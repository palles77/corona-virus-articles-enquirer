Asthma resulted in more than US$5.3 billion in indirect costs, $1.1 billion in lost school days, $1.5 billion in lost workdays, $840 million in caregiver/housekeeping costs, and $1.8 billion in mortality costs in the US in 1998 [4] .

The total paper production showed two obvious peaks in 1993 and 1999. An increasing trend of the top 10 countries producing publications also showed the same peaks in the same years. The contribution of the publication peak was affected by Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Canada in 1993 as well as by UK, France, Japan, and Sweden in 1999. The overall article production showed a growth pattern, in which the number papers per year increased by about two times in the following decade since 1991. A similar increasing trend in the number of countries is also apparent in Fig. 2 . In addition, a significant correlation between yearly cumulative number of publications and the year was also made (Fig. 3) . For the period from 1991 to 2002, the cumulative number of publications on relative research on asthma in children has increased. Ninetyeight papers were published in 1991, while in 2002 the cumulative number of publications was 1704. The relationship between yearly cumulative number of publications and year was analyzed by using linear, logistic, and exponential equations. Linear and logistic equations had high coefficient of determinations of 0.992 and 0.998 respectively. Linear fitting suggested that yearly publications were constantly sustained in each year. The logistic curve fitting, however, showed that yearly publications had a constant growth rate. It can be concluded that the number of publications on research on the topic of asthma in children is still growing by a small rate. Table 1 shows that asthma in children is an international research issue. There were 64 papers without author address information on the ISI Web of Science. For this reason, not all of the 1704 papers were included in the analyses of this section. Of 1640 papers, there was great diversity including 59 different countries, with the US producing the most papers (22.7%). Of the 1640 papers, 1463 (89.2%) were independent publications and 177 (10.8%) were international collaborative publications. Developed countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and the seven major industrial countries (G7: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US), were ranked in the top 10 of publications. Among these countries, the G7 published 69.7% of the 1640 papers. Moreover, G7 had high productivity in this topic, which included 861 (52.5% of 1640 papers) independent publications. The UK (71) and US (70) produced the most international collaborative papers followed by Sweden (28), Germany (26), and Australia (19). Costa Rica, Bulgaria, Kenya, and the United Arab Emirates only had publications done through international collaboration. Ecuador, Indonesia, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Slovenia, Qatar, Tunisia, Venezuela, Malaysia, Kuwait, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey had no internationally collaborative publications. In addition, the top 10 countries ranked by number of publications in Table 1 were compared by the mean IF per paper. The UK ranked first with a mean IF of 3.598 followed by the Netherlands (3.533), the US (3.460), Sweden (3.242), Denmark (3.224), Italy (3.157), Canada (2.984), Japan (2.906), Germany (2.296), and France (1.587). One hundred four papers from 33 countries considered were published in journals with no IF. The world IF for asthma in children papers was 3.025. The mean IF has also been analyzed for the geography of clinical cancer research publications. Canada ranked first with a mean IF of 3.95 [5] .",

Table 2 lists the 20 journals with the greatest number of published papers on asthma in children, their journal country, number of publication, and corresponding percentage and impact factor indexed in the 2002 edition of the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) published by the ISI. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, which is published in the US was first and published 196 (11.5%) of all papers. Second on the list is Pediatric Pulmonology, which is also published in the US and it was responsible for 108 (6.34%) of all papers. The third is the European Respiratory Journal. It is produced in the UK and published 104 (6.10%) of all papers. With regard to these journals covering the scope of asthma in children, four journals had an impact factor of > 10. Sixteen papers were published by them. Most of the journals had impact factors, which ranged from 0 to 3, accounting for 72.8% of all papers studied (Table 3 ). Journals with IFs of 1-2 published 475 (27.9%) papers, 300 (17.6%) were published by journals with IFs 6-10.",
