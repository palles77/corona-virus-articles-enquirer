Even so, the lack of specific guidance from regulatory agencies specifically relating to the first application of a new experimental vaccine in humans has hampered product development. Most of the regulatory guidance documents for manufacturers are too broad and sometimes only vague where vaccines are concerned. As regulators deeply involved both in the development of the European Medicines Agency's (EMA; London) new regulatory framework on risk identification and mitigation, and in assessment and authorization of clinical trial applications for biotechnological and biological products (especially vaccines), we have been repeatedly approached by companies and vaccine developers regarding regulatory issues for first-in-human clinical trials. Here, we discuss these considerations as they relate to vaccines within the context of the current EMA guideline for risk identification and mitigation for first-in-human clinical trials based on the apparently considerable uncertainty among developers. We describe how regulators apply the guideline and where we see the limitations or the need to take alternative approaches. The discussion primarily focuses on prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against infectious diseases as this classic field of products is associated with particular uncertainty.",

This guideline is applicable to any new molecular entity, both chemical and biotechnological and/or biological. Its main principle, which is now also widely applied by regulators assessing clinical trial applications in Europe, is an approach of risk identification and risk mitigation. This is done by assessing the mode of action, the nature of the target and the relevance of the animal species used for testing of nonclinical safety and toxicity. These issues are particularly pertinent to the design of firstin-human clinical trials of products that have a seemingly potentially higher risk in the first administration to humans than the nth iteration/ reformulation of an established product. The most important consideration is to commence testing with a conservative calculation of a safe starting dose and sequential inclusion of subjects in the trial to limit exposure.",

This is borne out by the observation that especially in live vaccines, but also in some others, there have been sporadic reports of rheumatic fever and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. At the same time, such complications are very rare and the causality is not always clear. For instance, sometimes concomitant minimal (respiratory) infections are present in a subject when an experimental vaccine is tested, but these are, of course, no reason to delay a vaccination.

The first-inhuman trial is a critical turning point between preclinical studies and first human exposure and subsequent larger clinical trials in hundreds or (for many vaccines) thousands of subjects. For sponsors, relevant risk assessment for first-inhuman clinical studies means careful design and conduct of studies that reduce potential risk to humans.

This became known world wide as the Cutter incident, in which 40,000 children developed mild polio, 200 were permanently paralyzed and 10 died 6 . Another example is an aggravated or atypical disease following vaccination and exposure to wild-type viruses caused by a measles and respiratory syncitial virus 7 or experimental severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 8 vaccine. Regarding live-attenuated vaccines, data suggesting elevated mortality observed in developing countries following vaccination with medium-and high-titer measles vaccines demonstrate again the need for cautious approaches when entering into early clinical trial phase 9 .

Such knowledge is relevant to the risk assessment of a novel vaccine against an infection for the following reasons: first, vaccines often present an antigen in an artificial context (that is, as repetitive structures, such as in virus-like particles, as fragments of epitopes or as capsules); second, in many cases, vaccines are administered together with an adjuvant that enhances or modulates the immune response (see below); and third, vaccines provide an antigen dose that is both different from that seen in a natural infection and most times presented to the immune system by a different route.

This approach was also chosen for the agonistic anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody TGN1412, but was apparently insufficient to prevent the highly elevated pharmacodynamic effect, a massive cytokine-release syndrome 16 . Thus, the EMA guideline advocates an alternative approach, that is, a calculation based on the minimalanticipated-biological-effect level (MABEL), being the dose level at which a minimal biological effect in humans is expected by in vitro or in vivo data. It is based on the occurrence of any biological effect, not only toxicity. Thus, the MABEL approach usually results in a much lower dose than that calculated with the NOAEL approach, which relates to toxicity findings. Here, the classic paradigm of a dosedependent effect ( including toxicity) is implicitly assumed-a principle already questionable for certain biotechnological medicinal products that can exhibit distinct pharmacodynamic effects at a low dose. For vaccines, additionalor even alternative-considerations need to be made because often thresholds for eliciting an immune response exist. Thus, the principle of little dose increases in cohorts might not be applicable here regarding the toxicity (if any) of the vaccine itself and consequences of the elicited immune response. In addition, if no correlate of clinical protection yet exists for the respective vaccination or if thresholds of antibodies are different between serotypes included in a vaccine (e.g., pneumococcal vaccines), the respective dose for a MABEL would be difficult to determine. C O M M E N TA R Y have to be formed after vaccination and clinical manifestation normally requires a certain time following binding of those antibodies to the target organ structures. Therefore, these 'longterm' risks are hardly suitable to determine any inter-subject interval for administration in a sequential dosing concept but are rather meant to define suitable endpoints as discussed above. Another potential long-term risk is the possibility for a paradoxical enhancement of the disease (e.g., overstimulating immune cells by prolonging presentation of the pathogen antigen-antibody complexes).",

For most vaccines, single-dose administration is insufficient to establish immune protection as well as boosterable long-term persistence of the immune response. Adverse effects not triggered by a first dose might be triggered or will become detectable only during completion of the primary vaccination regimen or at the time of booster vaccination. These phenomena are known as positive re-exposure. The risk might then increase with the frequency of administration of a specific vaccine to achieve an acceptable immune response and might be particularly high for vaccines that must be administered at regular intervals. In view of these effects, the vaccination schedule also needs to be taken into consideration for the definition of the safe starting dose. As such safety issues cannot readily be predicted, a simulation of the vaccination schedule in animals should be made. In addition, appropriate safety evaluations in vaccinees and regular and extensive follow-up the tissue structure may not be accessible under physiological conditions in humans. A shortcoming of this approach is that it tests only the antibody response; a T-cell response cannot be tested. This is problematic as T cells might be the main driver for toxicity in humans. Even so, such findings should be regarded as potential safety signals and will be helpful in assessing risks. For a first-in-human study (and subsequent clinical studies), such signals trigger the implementation of relevant clinical safety endpoints to detect potential clinical manifestations of such bindings or confirm that it does not occur in patients. These will be aimed mostly at subclinical changes, for instance, echocardiography in case binding to human cardiac tissue sections had been observed.

Antibodies immune response against it could be harmful. Antibodies can cross-react with physiological structures and the concept of 'molecular mimicry' 18 is one of the hypotheses by which autoimmunity is explained.

This approach, in which animals are vaccinated and their sera tested for cross-reactivity with human tissue sections, is routinely carried out in nonclinical toxicology testing of monoclonal antibodies. In the case of a vaccine product, the animal species might not necessarily have to be 'relevant' (see discussion below) because the animals are used rather to obtain the antibodies that can then be tested for toxicity. In addition, for the choice of the species, one may have to take into account that unrelated species may produce cross-reactive antibodies. These might be deleted in highly related species due to a tolerance for self that is shared by related but not by unrelated species. Nevertheless, such results can be useful to create a ' worst-case scenario' for cross-reactivity and may be helpful when considering risks. It is acknowledged that cross-reactivity studies have their inherent difficulties as data may be misleading if artifacts arise due to tissue preparation and fixation procedures. Even if true binding or cross-reactivity is observed, this might not necessarily point to a safety concern as C O M M E N TA R Y nonavailability of some animal models (e.g., the aforementioned chimpanzee model for animal protection reasons). A crucial point is to carefully consider physiological systems that might be or will be affected and how a vaccine could affect the response of different immunological cells that would be observed during natural infection; for example, overstimulated T cells can result in unexpected acute and chronic adverse events. Use of worst-case-scenario data from animals obtained with different doses of antigen and adjuvant and/or immunomodulator can be helpful in the estimation of the likelihood of such events to occur in humans, up to a full-blown systemic inflammatory response syndrome with its adverse impact on heart, liver, kidney and the central nervous system. For some organ systems and physiological scenarios, computer models are available that derive their accuracy from data that have been collected in all kinds of previous studies in humans of different age, gender and with co-morbidities; these can be helpful tools to estimate potential reactions only seen in human organisms 22 . Whether such models are useful for the development of vaccines has to be considered on a case-by-case basis and may best be discussed with regulators upfront. Usually, only single and repeated dose toxicity studies in at least one animal species are required before first-in-human administration (repeat dose toxicity for most vaccines that are applied at least twice). For vaccines that target children and/or women of child-bearing potential, the influence on the reproductive system has to be explored. Here, different animal models might be defined as 'relevant' compared with the other nonclinical studies. For the emerging class of genetically modified biological systems, the risk of possible gene transfer into humans (or the human germ line) also needs to be quantified. Reproductive toxicity includes male and female reproductive capacity as well as the possible influence of transferred genes on the development of the embryo/fetus during pregnancy. This might indeed be an issue, given the complex changes to the maternal organism during pregnancy, including maternal-fetal exchange (hormones, antibodies and so forth).

It is a certainty that even this guideline and all precautionary principles will never reduce the risk to zero.

Such a balanced view is particularly important with the emergence of new infectious agents (e.g., SARS and H1N1 influenza), the continued battle against neglected (tropical) diseases and the re-emergence of pathogens and vectors worldwide displaying increasing resistance to existing therapeutic agents. In this context, the establishment of new vaccines both against known and novel infectious diseases, as well as the improvement of established vaccines through novel techniques (e.g., genetic modification), is of the utmost importance. In addition, vaccination usually represents the cheapest and at the same time the most effective means of disease prevention worldwide.In this context, a balanced and reasonable approach for first-in-human studies of a novel vaccine candidate is crucial to ensure safety of trial participants. The principles of the EMA guideline need to be applied in a reasonable and scientific way based on how prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against infectious diseases function. Some principles, like the MABEL or NOAEL approaches, might require very careful adaptation to the specific needs and/or aspects of any given product, including a novel vaccine, as we discuss above. If a first-in-human trial for a vaccine does apply the MABEL strategy (e.g., for a novel adjuvant) and implements gradual dose increases, this merely represents the first step in defining the safety of administration. It must not be mistaken as 'dose finding' for immunogenicity, safety and tolerability. These are integral parts of further vaccine development to arrive at a dose that is maximally safe and immunogenic.The discussion in this article demonstrates that the definition of a starting dose for a novel vaccine might not be straightforward; indeed, 'automatic' use of the MABEL approach might lead to misleading results. When uncertainty or doubt arises, we strongly advise manufacturers to seek discussion with regulatory agencies. This can be done either on a national level with the respective national competent authority in the EU member states (e.g., in Germany, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut) or on a European level by using the CHMP Scientific Advice Procedure 29 (http://www.ema.europa.eu/ htms/human/ raguidelines/sa_pa.htm.). The former approach has the advantage of a direct discussion with the competent authority later responsible for evaluating and granting the C O M M E N TA R Y",
