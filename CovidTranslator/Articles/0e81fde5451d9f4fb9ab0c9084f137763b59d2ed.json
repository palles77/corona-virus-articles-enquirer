Two other similar books followed, that of Metlinger (German) in 1473 and of Roelans (Belgian) in 1483. Eucharius Roesslin (German) opened the 16th Century of pediatric texts with a text on midwifery and pediatrics, with reviews of the 35 most common ailments of children, including many infections, of course (2) . The book by Leonellus Faventinus de Victoriis (Italian) was published posthumously in 1544 and included a chapter on aphthae and another on measles and smallpox. The first English-language pediatric book was published in 1544 by Thomas Phaer, \"The Boke of Chyldren\" and included chapters on Aposteme of the brayne (meningitis), Scalles of the heed, Styfnesse of the lymmes, Bloodshoten eyes [Kawasaki disease?], Diseases in the eares, Canker in the mouth, Quynsye or swelling of throte, Coughe, Feblenesse of the stomacke and vomiting, Fluxe of the belly (diarrhea), Wormes, Small pockes and measels, Fevers, and Consumpcion (1, 2) . In 1553 Giovanne P. Ingrassias (Italian) differentiated scarlet fever (rossalia) from measles (1) . Hieronymus Mercurialis (Italian) in 1583 published a pediatric text that mentioned the King's Evil (scrofulous glands) and included 10 chapters on worms (1) . At the end of the 16th Century, understanding of disease in children had barely advanced beyond the theories and observations of the Greeks and Romans, restated by the Arab physicians, and clinical observation seemed of little value.",

The third English book appeared in 1664, written by J. Starsmare and included much the same topics but making the first mention in English of scrofula. Franciscus Sylvius de le Boe (Dutch) was a careful clinician and anatomist who published a book on diseases of infants in 1674 that included the usual topics. Sylvius is remembered best for the aqueduct of Sylvius and the sylvian fissure. Thomas Sydenham, the most respected English physician of the 17th Century, deserves mention here for his careful description of chorea (1686), his very detailed description of measles (1670), and his account of scarlet fever (1675), which surprisingly failed to mention pharyngitis. Thomas Willis, who described the circle of Willis, wrote a careful account of pertussis (chincough) in 1675 and said, \"The plan of treatment which is usual in other varieties of cough is seldom of any use in this, which is the reason why old women and gypsies are consulted more often than doctors\" (1) .",

Inoculation with matter from a smallpox subject was introduced into Western Europe from Constantinople around 1720, with limited mortality from the procedure and resulting immunity (1). Other advances were being made as well. Richard Wiseman (English) , surgeon to King Charles II, wrote extensively about the King's Evil (scrofula) and mesenteric adenitis. Jean Astruc (French) in 1746 published an English edition of his lectures on diseases of children that included pertussis, infant diarrhea, worms, purulent lung disease, and scrofula.

A very severe New England epidemic of diphtheria in 1735-1740 killed more than 5000 individuals, mostly children, and was later called \"the most horrible epidemic of a children's disease in American history\" (7) . Early accounts by Jabez Fitch (1736) of New Hampshire and Jonathan Dickinson (1740) described these events (2) . Samuel Bard (8) . This work about diphtheria emphasized its infective etiology, \"drawn in by the breath of a healthy child,\" and urged prevention by immediate removal of the young children in the family as soon as a first case appeared in a household. In 1736 William Douglass (1691 -1752 of Boston provided what is considered the earliest complete description of scarlet fever, terming it angina ulcusculosa (5) . In 1789, Dr. Benjamin Rush (1745-1813) described a widespread epidemic of scarlet fever (\"scarlatina anginosa\") occurring in Philadelphia in 1783 and 1784, while pertussis was described in detail in 1776 by Lionel Chalmers (1715 Chalmers ( -1777 in An Account of the Weather and Diseases of South Carolina (9) . Dysentery (\"bloody flux\") was emphasized as a serious and very common problem of children particularly in summer when Benjamin Rush wrote in detail about \"cholera infantum\" (and coined the term) in 1777 (10) . Rush was the most influential American physician of his day and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and he lectured and published regarding pediatric disorders, including cholera infantum and diphtheria (11) . Cholera infantum, or summer diarrhea, appeared each year in epidemic form and emerged later as a particularly important problem for young children, as more crowded urban areas developed. In 1794 Rush also described a major epidemic of yellow fever in Philadelphia which killed about one-eighth of the population (5) .",

This serves as a striking reminder about this now-preventable illness. Other primarily pediatric illnesses including thrush, mumps, tinea capitis, and worm infestations also were clearly described in the colonies of the 18th Century (5) . In contrast to Europe, where smallpox was an endemic illness of childhood, in the colonies smallpox occurred in large epidemics with about 20-year periodicity and affected children as well as older susceptible individuals. This became an important issue during the Revolutionary War, when the troops of the Continental Army (but not the British forces) were ravaged by smallpox until General George Washington at Valley Forge decided to inoculate all susceptible troops.

For example, for the first three decades of the 19th Century, the severity of scarlet fever was less than observed previously but then around 1830 increased dramatically. By 1840 scarlet fever had become the leading cause of death among the infectious diseases of childhood in the U.S., Great Britain, and Europe (13) . Changes in the virulence of prevalent Group A streptococcal strains would seem most likely responsible for such fluctuations, as seen in New York City, for example, where only 43 scarlet fever deaths were recorded from 1805-1822, but 4874 deaths by 1847 (14) .",

This 1828 work built upon that of Bichat and Laennec, who provided the initial scientific basis of 166 SHULMAN medicine, and classified pediatric disorders (including infectious diseases) based not upon symptoms but upon pathologic lesions, i.e. upon autopsy findings (3) . Armand Trousseau (French) performed the first tracheostomy in Paris (1831), described laryngeal tuberculosis, cutaneous and mucosal diphtheria, pediatric cholera, and he originated the technique of thoracentesis in pleurisy.

Infectious diseases such as diarrhea, diphtheria, scarlet fever and tuberculosis dominated as the major causes of morbidity and mortality among children, and they had yet to be impacted by the just-emerging scientific base of medicine. The science of bacteriology, founded on the landmark discoveries of Louis Pasteur in Paris, Robert Koch in Berlin, and others in the early 1880s, had not yet impacted child health. Roentgen had not yet discovered x-rays. Biochemical analyses were not available for infants and children. Inadequate sanitation, impure water and unsafe milk supplies all contributed very significantly to the spread of infectious diseases among infants and children, and particularly to those living in the very crowded circumstances that promote transmission.",

A committee was apparently appointed, as the 1896 annual meeting included a report from the American Pediatric Society's Collective Investigation of the Antitoxin Treatment of Diphtheria in Private Practice, chaired by L. Emmett Holt. This confirmed the spectacular results of the 1894 French report by Roux, Martin, and Chaillou from the Pasteur Institute in Paris. The 1897 meeting received a report from the Committee on Collective Investigation of the Antitoxin Treatment of Laryngeal Diphtheria in Private Practice, chaired by William P. Northrup (24) . These clinical studies of diphtheria equine antitoxin represented the first pediatric investigations in the U.S. of a national scope. The four committee members analyzed 1704 cases of laryngeal diphtheria treated with antitoxin who were submitted by APS members and concluded that antitoxin lowered the necessity for intubation from 90% to 39% and the mortality rate from 73% to 27% in this severest form of diphtheria (24) . The Schick test to assess susceptibility to diphtheria was introduced by Bela Schick in 1913. Emil von Behring of Germany, who initially discovered diphtheria toxin and developed the diphtheria antitoxin that was of such great interest and importance, was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1901 for this work.",

Tuberculosis was another very common and serious problem of childhood, and William Osler was very actively involved in its study before moving to Oxford, England, in 1905 to become the Regius Professor.

He was particularly interested in tuberculosis of childhood and presented a paper at the third APS meeting in 1891 on pulmonary tuberculosis in children, in which he divided it into acute, subacute, and chronic or protracted forms (20, 25) , and another in 1893 that included autopsy findings (7) .

Many other academics preferred certification as an alternative to pasteurization, fearing that the latter would alter the chemical composition of milk and promote gastroenteritis. This proved wrong (29) . Jacobi collaborated with the philanthropist Nathan Straus to establish pasteurization plants and milk stations for poor infants in New York beginning in 1893. A reduction in infant mortality of 65% was observed in just one year in the foundling hospital on Randall's Island after a pasteurization plant was established there by Straus (2, 5). However, it was not until 1908 that Chicago became the first city in the world to require pasteurization of milk, with many cities following thereafter (5) . Controversy in this area was apparent early on, best exemplified perhaps by the resignation from the APS in 1892 of Arthur V. Meigs of Philadelphia, who argued vehemently against milk sterilization and who continued to reject the germ theory of disease until his death in 1912 (6, 21) .",

The improved milk supply was complemented by studies, primarily at Johns Hopkins, by Holt, James Gamble, W.

As microbiologic advances were made, American Pediatric Society meetings continued to include many papers related to epidemic infectious diseases including summer diarrhea, poliomyelitis, typhoid fever, gonococcal infection, and meningococcal meningitis. Increasingly large U.S. poliomyelitis epidemics occurred, primarily affecting children, for example in New York City in 1907, with almost 3000 cases and up to 12% mortality (7) . This peaked in a 1916 epidemic in the Northeast with almost 30,000 cases and 6,000 deaths, many in the New York City area, leading to massive public anxiety and aggres-sive public health measures including quarantine and travel restrictions (5) . Progress in understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of polio was made early in the 20th Century. In Vienna in 1909 Landsteiner and Popper transmitted polio to monkeys by intraperitoneal injection of spinal cord material from a child who died early in the course of polio. Also in 1909 Simon Flexner (of Shigella flexneri fame) and Paul Lewis in New York extended those studies to show transmission to monkeys also after s.c., i.v., or intracerebral routes of inoculation and produced disease using filtrates of nasopharyngeal washes from polio patients (5) . Additional Flexner studies from 1910 -1917 showed that sera from monkeys that recovered neutralized the infectivity of polio material, that intrathecal injection of convalescent sera within 24 h of inoculation prevented paralysis, that recovered monkeys were protected against subsequent inoculation, and that recovered human patient sera contained antibodies to the infectious agent (5) . Great effort was devoted by several groups to use intrathecal administration of convalescent polio sera to treat children with acute poliomyelitis but this proved unhelpful (5) . The development of the iron lung by Philip Drinker in the late 1920s was a noteworthy therapeutic advance for affected patients.",

Nevertheless, syphilis, tuberculosis, pertussis, measles, rheumatic fever, streptococcal infections, polio, and meningitis continued to interest those caring for children, as reflected by papers presented at the annual APS meetings. Active immunization against diphtheria using toxin and antitoxin was introduced by Alfred Hess in the U.S. in 1916 (7) . At the end of this era, a particularly interesting paper was presented in 1937 by Francis Schwentker, who reported the treatment of meningococcal meningitis with s.c. and intrathecal para-aminobenzenesulfonamide (sulfanilamide) (7) . The first use of an antimicrobial agent in the U.S. was by future APS President A. Ashley Weech, whose unsuccessful treatment of a physician's child with H. influenzae meningitis with the sulfanilamidecontaining compound sulfachrysoidine in 1935 has been well documented (34, 35) . The actual administration of this agent was by the Chief Resident at Babies Hospital in New York, F. 170 SHULMAN Howell Wright, who later served as Chair of Pediatrics at the University of Chicago and President and Executive Secretary of the American Board of Pediatrics (35) . During this era, several APS presidential addresses concerned infectious disease issues, including that by Linnaeus LaF\u00e9tra in 1918 regarding the need for preventive measures against infectious diseases and rheumatic fever in children two to six years old; by Thomas S. Southworth in 1920 on the communicability of acute pneumonia and the need for isolation of such patients, as was done for tuberculosis patients; by L. Emmett Holt in 1923 highlighting the decline in infectious diseases, particularly diarrhea, diphtheria and acute respiratory disease (as discussed above); and by Henry F. Helmholtz in 1937 on infections of the renal parenchyma and the importance of stasis in predisposing to urinary tract infection (7, 19) .",

Isaac Abt of Chicago became the first President of the AAP, which had 304 charter members and held its first meeting in Atlantic City, NJ, on June 12-13, 1931 (7) . Early in its existence, the AAP declared its interest and involvement in infectious diseases issues. The AAP established a Special Committee on Prophylactic Procedures Against Communicable Diseases in 1933, chaired by Edward B. Shaw of San Francisco and including J.E. Gordon of Detroit and J.A. Toomey of Cleveland. This committee was disbanded after its report \"Routine Measures for the Prophylaxis of Communicable Diseases\" was published in The Journal of Pediatrics in April 1935 (36) . This six-page report dealt with diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, whooping cough, measles, smallpox, polio (3 lines), epidemic meningitis (1 line), mumps and chickenpox (4 lines), rabies, and tetanus. The Committee on Immunization Procedures was then established in 1936, with John A. Toomey as chair. Three years later the committee name was changed again to the Committee on Immunizations and Therapeutic Procedures for Acute Infectious Diseases, in 1953 it was modified again to the Committee on Control of Infectious Diseases, and then in 1969 to the Committee on Infectious Diseases, the current name, although it is now most commonly referred to as the Red Book Committee. Since 1938, this AAP committee has published a report every one to five years (every three years for the past five editions), which because of the color of its binding has been known as the Red Book for many editions.

The period from 1945 to about 1965 heralded the era of modern infectious diseases and coincided with the increasing trend to subspecialization within pediatrics and the development of full-time pediatric departments. Antimicrobial advances included the discoveries of streptomycin, isoniazid and then other agents to treat tuberculosis, as well as penicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and other antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections. Virtually universally fatal infections such as bacterial meningitis and endocarditis became amenable to therapy. American Pediatric Society presidential addresses during this period that dealt with infectious diseases topics included that by Jean V. Cooke in 1949 discussing the impact of specific therapy including antimicrobials upon the common contagious diseases and reviewing mortality statistics (7). This era was associated with the virtual elimination of congenital syphilis, early studies of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, improved methods of viral cultivation, but also large poliomyelitis epidemics.",

Warren Wheeler in 1972 in his presidential address dis-172 SHULMAN cussed the epidemics of enteropathogenic E. coli 0111 in the 1930s and 1940s and those of S. aureus 80/81 in the 1950s, recommending surveillance to detect emergent bacterial \"hot strains\" (21) . Saul Krugman, APS President in 1973, devoted his distinguished career to the field of infectious diseases, especially to the study of hepatitis viruses. Fred Robbins (1974) and Horace Hodes (1975) were each responsible for signal discoveries in virology, the former having received the Nobel Prize in 1954 with John Enders and Tom Weller for the development of tissue culture technology that led to viral vaccine production, and the latter devoting his life to investigations of viral gastroenteritis of infants and vaccine development (21) . Margaret H. D. Smith (1977) worked tirelessly in the field of pediatric tuberculosis and advocated for social activism by organized pediatrics. C. Henry Kempe (1978) was instrumental in the eradication of smallpox, and Floyd Denny (1981) contributed to the understanding of group A streptococci and to the conquest of rheumatic fever. During this era, infections in the immunocompromised child began to emerge as an important clinical problem, as increasing numbers of cancer patients and other compromised patient populations were generated by improved treatment modalities (37) , and these were accompanied by increasing numbers of opportunistic viral, fungal and bacterial infections requiring expert management.",

Identifying perinatal vertical transmission risk factors, dealing with transfusion-associated HIV infection (particularly in the hemophiliac population), and determining the clinical, virologic and immunologic parameters of pediatric AIDS occupied the first decade or so of the pediatric AIDS experience. The landmark 1994 report of the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 076 that demonstrated the marked effectiveness of zidovudine administered to pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV led to dramatic reduction in the number of perinatally infected children within several years in developed countries. In other areas of the world, where antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy is not being utilized, vertical transmission of HIV continues unabated. In recent years, in the U.S., the field of pediatric AIDS has focused increas- ingly upon prevention and treatment of adolescent HIV infection as well as upon the highly effective multi-drug therapies. Table 2 provides a listing of presidents of APS with major interests in infectious diseases issues. Recent APS presidents have included Sam Katz (1987), whose career has been devoted to vaccine development and implementation; Paul Quie (1988), a bacterial phagocytosis scholar; Vince Fulginiti (1992) , who advanced the fields of prenatal infections and viral vaccinology; and Ralph Feigin (1998), an authority on meningitis and many other aspects of pediatric infectious diseases.
