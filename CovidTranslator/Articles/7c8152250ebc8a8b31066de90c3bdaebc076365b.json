The SARS-CoV-2 infected parturients in the early stages of COVID-19 outbreak was much more than during the later stage. The main clinical characteristics of parturients with COVID-19 were fever (34.8%), cough (33.7%), an increased plasma CRP (52.8%) and a decreased lymphocyte counting (33.7%). A high rate of emergency and a high incidence of anaesthesia-related complications, such as pharyngalgia, multiple puncture, intraoperative hypotension, nausea, vomiting, vertigo and chills in the COVID-19 parturients. In addition, the parturients with COVID-19 had a long duration of operation and hospital stay, and an increased intraoperative oxytocin utilization and postoperative oxygen therapy. The newborns from the SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, who received general anaesthesia, had a high risk of Apgar score \u2264 8 at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery and a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.",

More than 50 countries have declared a state of emergency, and some countries have even declared a state of \"war\". As of March 21, 2020, a total 266,073 patients of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in the world 1 . The clinical manifestations of SARS-Cov-2 infection range from asymptomatic (no symptoms) mild to severe organ dysfunction such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to death [2] [3] [4] . The common symptoms including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and lymphopenia in infected patients. The typical abnormality of CT scan was bilateral distribution of patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity 5 . A study has reported that the pathological features of COVID-19 greatly are similar with those seen in SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection, such as the bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation 6 .",

The results indicated that the high rates of emergency and general anaesthesia use were likely due to the high risk for parturients and newborn. Consisting with previous reports 9 , the clinical manifestation of parturients with COVID-19 had mild symptoms and none severe phenotype if the disease was in our study. Thus, the intrathecal anaesthesia was the first choice for parturients with COVID-19 in order to reduce medical staff exposing to virus via patient's airway. Spinal anaesthesia is a safe and quick technique for cesarean delivery due to its quality of sensory blockade and reliability. However, the risk of high level of sensory blockade and the high incidence and degree of hypotension may be the disadvantages when compared with epidural anaesthesia. Although none of the mothers who received intrathecal anaesthesia for delivery had any complications in this study, considering that SARS-CoV-2 virus may also invade the central nervous system 10 , epidural anaesthesia seems to be superior for patients with COVID-19. Due to the limited tactile sensation of PPE, it is necessary to use ultrasound guide epidural procedure for avoiding unintentional dural puncture and subarachnoid catheterization.",

Although general anaesthesia would induce or exacerbate pulmonary complications in parturients 11 with COVID-19, the cesarean delivery under general anaesthesia is necessarily to be used for fetal distress, potential contraindication of intrathecal anaesthesia, as well as intrathecal anaesthesia failure. The rapid-sequence induction by using propofol, rocuronium and remifentanil was used in our COVID-19 patients and the excellent maternal hemodynamic stability was noted. However, the possible risk of short-time neonatal depression and required short periods of mask ventilation or tactile stimulation of the neonate were found. However, in this study, either intravenous or inhalational induction was not difference in term of the safety of maternal and neonatal and the risk infection of medical staff. To avoid hemorrhage resulted from uterine atony, inhalational sevoflurane was switched into intravenous anaesthetics after umbilical cordligation.

Potential multi-target organ damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women may increase the chance of COVID-19 parturients received caesarean section. Taken more precaution care for those patients are necessary. Cesarean delivery increased the risk of microenvironmental aerosols. Consequently, the fetus should be cleaned of amniotic fluid and blood from the mouth and nose and then transferred to incubator rapidly after delivery to reduce neonatal infection. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 virus may also invade the central nervous system, indicating that the risk of maternal nervous system injury cannot be ignored.
