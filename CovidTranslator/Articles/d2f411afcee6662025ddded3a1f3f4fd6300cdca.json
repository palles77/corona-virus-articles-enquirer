            "text": "Increasing numbers of hospital-acquired infections have generated much attention over the last decade. The public has linked the so-called 'superbugs' with their experience of dirty hospitals, but the precise role of cleaning in the control of these organisms in unknown. Hence the importance of a clean environment is likely to remain speculative unless it becomes an evidence-based science. This proposal is a call for bacteriological standards with which to assess clinical surface hygiene in hospitals, based on those used by the food industry. The first standard concerns any finding of a specific 'indicator' organism, the presence of which suggests a requirement for increased cleaning. Indicators would include Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and various Gram-negative bacilli. The second standard concerns a quantitative aerobic colony count of , 5 cfu/cm 2 on frequent hand touch surfaces in hospitals. The principle relates to modern risk management systems such as HACCP, and reflects the fact that pathogens of concern are widespread. Further work is required to evaluate and refine these standards and define the infection risk from the hospital environment.",

            "text": "There has been recent concern from the public, media and infection control staff over perceived inadequacies in hospital cleaning. 1, 2 There may be a link between dirty hospitals and the rising numbers of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) but there is little evidence to be able to substantiate this at present. 3 Several professional bodies have published standards or audits regarding environmental cleanliness in hospitals. 4, 5 Unfortunately, the mechanisms for evaluating the quality of hospital cleaning regimens are limited. Quite often the only method used is visual assessment, which does not necessarily correspond with microbiological risk. 6, 7 Hospital patients can acquire organisms from many sources, including the environment, but the extent to which the latter contributes towards HAI is largely unknown. 3,8 -10 This is because cleaning has never been regarded, let alone investigated, as an evidence-based science. 11 The difficulties in measuring cleaning efficacy are compounded by the lack of standardized methodologies and are rarely quantitative. Environmental screening usually takes place on an ad hoc basis after an outbreak, but it is patently impossible to screen the entire surface of a ward and finding the outbreak strain is not guaranteed. Furthermore, organisms still have to be transmitted to patients. As this is thought to occur via staff hands, strategies for controlling HAI are more likely to favour improvements in hand hygiene than comprehensive screening programmes. Cost-benefit and lack of standardized methodologies might also explain the perceived reluctance of private cleaning companies to participate in screening. Certainly, most microbiologists would be cautions about taking environmental samples from hospital wards on a routine basis. 12 Despite the lack of evidence, the hospital environment may well act as a significant reservoir for potential pathogens. 13 A favourable niche can quickly be found, and retained, unless disturbed by some appropriate cleaning or disinfection process. 3 This reservoir can then be extended by vectors such as air turbulence, aerosolized moisture, an unwashed hand or direct contact with an inanimate object, equipment or material. 13, 14 The hands of healthcare workers may well represent the final mode of transmission, but even exemplary hand hygiene cannot be expected to break the chain of infection when the environment is heavily contaminated. 11, 14, 15 Cleaning has two main functions: first, nonmicrobiological, to improve or restore appearance, maintain function and prevent deterioration. Second, microbiological, to reduce the numbers of microbes present, together with any substances that support their growth or interfere with disinfection/sterilization. 16 The term 'cleaning', therefore, can be interpreted in different ways. 7 However, patients and their relatives expect a clean uncluttered environment in hospitals. 10 They criticize hospitals they consider dirty and associate them with a general lack of care. 10, 16 Such consumer demands for cleaning aesthetics cannot be disputed. Maintenance of a pristine hospital environment, however, requires funding from scant NHS resources. Furthermore, there is a conflict of interests for private cleaning companies between hygiene standards and profits. The importance of keeping a hospital clean will probably continue to be justified on grounds of 'common sense', but that may not be sufficient to attract managerial attention. 17 Infection control personnel feel that there is some risk to patients from a dirty ward, but this risk is difficult to demonstrate, and even more difficult to measure. Furthermore, managers responsible for domestic services are not necessarily directed by infection control staff when attempting to set up cleaning schedules for different areas within a hospital. Basic hospital cleaning will continue to be an emotive issue for patients, and problematic for managers and infection control personnel. Without real evidence of its value, however, it is unlikely to become a priority for NHS managers.",

To achieve this, it is necessary to adopt an integrated and risk-based approach. This would include preliminary visual assessment, rapid sensitive tests for organic deposits and specific microbiological investigations. 28 Such an approach has already been established by the food industry to manage cleaning practices in a cost-effective manner and is described elsewhere. 29, 30 There is also an index of microbial air contamination (IMA) established for environments at risk, with maximum acceptable levels for different classes of contamination. 31 Even recreational waters are analysed for microbial indicators of human sewage and the corresponding health risk. 32 It has already been suggested that the surface level environment in hospital wards should be subjected to a similar strategy. 7 The proposal of the present work focuses upon possible bacteriological standards for assessing surface hygiene, based on standards applied in the food industry, 29, 30 but modified to reflect the differences between risk management in food preparation and the risk for acquiring infection in hospital. They are presented after consideration of all available evidence and comprise two main features: first, the identification of an indicator organism of potential high-risk to patients in any amount, and second, the quantitative assessment of organisms found within a specified area, regardless of identity. The latter is included because a heavy burden of any microbes from specified surfaces in a hospital may constitute a risk to patients. It circumvents the difficulties in locating a pathogen, when screening an entire ward. Positive findings for either standard should direct attention to the quality, quantity and methods of cleaning used. These standards would usually be applied before and after cleaning in order to assess efficacy, but could also be used during an outbreak or high-risk incident with a serious pathogen.",
