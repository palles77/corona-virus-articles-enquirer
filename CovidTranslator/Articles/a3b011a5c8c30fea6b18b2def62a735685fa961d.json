To implement a learner-led, discussion-based course aimed at exposing second-year pharmacy learners to the study of emerging infectious diseases from a global health perspective and to assess the role and importance of pharmacists in the management of disease outbreaks. Design. Learners examined literature pertinent to an emerging infectious disease in a 3-credit, discussionbased course and participated in peer discussion led by a designated learner. Instructional materials included journal articles, audio-visual presentations, documentaries, book chapters, movies, newspaper/ magazine articles, and other materials. Learning outcomes were measured based on the ability of learners to perform critical thinking and analysis, communicate with their peers, and participate in class discussions. Assessment. The course was offered to 2 consecutive cohorts consisting of 14 and 16 learners, respectively. Overall, every learner in the first cohort achieved a final grade of A for the course. In the second cohort, the overall grade distribution consisted of grades of A, B, and C for the course. Learner evaluations indicated that the active-learning, discussion-based environment significantly enhanced interest in the topic and overall performance in the course. Conclusion. The elective course on emerging infectious diseases provided in-depth exposure to disease topics normally not encountered in the pharmacy curriculum. Learners found the material and format valuable, and the course enhanced their appreciation of infectious diseases, research methodology, critical thinking and analysis, and their roles as pharmacists.",

In 2010, nearly a quarter of the estimated 52.8 million deaths worldwide were attributed to infectious diseases. 1, 2 Moreover, in an era of globalized travel and trade, the rise of emergent and re-emergent infectious diseases in previously nonendemic areas is also becoming a reality. 1 The rise of antimicrobial resistance and the spread of superbugs in several parts of the world are further causes of concern and compound the problem of combating the spread of acute infectious diseases. Hence, a wellcoordinated effort by teams of health care professionals, including pharmacists, is essential not only in curbing the spread of infectious disease, but also in enacting public health measures and educating the public about specific diseases and the dangers of antimicrobial resistance.",

Infectious diseases are emphasized in the academic curriculum at Western New England University College of Pharmacy, and the topic comprises 4 credits of the Integrated Pharmacy Care and Patient Management (IPC and PM) modules. However, the primary focus in these courses is on diseases and infections widely encountered by pharmacists in the United States, with limited exposure to emerging infectious diseases. The rationale behind the creation of this elective course was to not only introduce pharmacy learners to the study of emergent diseases, but also allow them to consider approaches to disease management from a public health context, with a specific emphasis on the roles of pharmacists as health care professionals. Furthermore, a discussion-based format focused on examination of the primary literature would make it a truly interactive course placing a significant onus on learners to deepen and enrich their own education.",

As such, wellrounded pharmacists must not only have knowledge about drugs used to treat diseases, but also be up to speed with recent advances in research and other novel measures aimed at curbing the spread of the disease. In addition, they also should be able to communicate this information appropriately to the target patient audience.

All learners were expected to read articles and reviews in advance, whether leading the discussion or not. Other instructional materials included audio-visual presentations, documentaries, book chapters, movies, and newspaper/magazine articles. The instructor presented the first article to demonstrate the expected discussion format. All future article discussions were led by learners. During discussion, typically, the leader presented approximately 15 minutes of background on the topic and a brief summary of the research paper. Subsequently, the leader would discuss the hypothesis and experimental approach of the study, analyze the validity of the observations/experiments, critique the study, and propose new ideas and/or hypotheses. The goals of the discussion were for learners to not only understand the research presented in the paper, but also pick out its strengths and weaknesses, evaluate the importance of the research in the field, and consider future implications of the disease. All discussion leaders were encouraged to meet with the instructor for assistance in advance of the scheduled discussion and to prepare questions relevant to the article as a way of engaging classmates.",

Specific criteria assessed included knowledge and comprehension of the topic, ability to critique journal articles and research studies, and the manner in which learners promoted class discussion. Out of 20 points, 5 were awarded for thorough preparation for the class discussion, 5 for knowledge displayed about the topic, 5 for critique of the research article, and 5 for engaging classmates in discussion. Although no specific prerequisites in biostatistics or literature evaluation were required for the course, all learners had taken 2 semesters of the Informatics course as part of the PharmD curriculum. While learners in the first cohort (14 learners) performed well overall in terms of having read the articles and leading class discussion (100% of designated learners received an A in this category on their chosen disease topic), several learners in the second cohort struggled with the class discussion. In this cohort of 16 learners, 56% received As, 6% received Bs, 13% received Cs, and 25% received Fs. The primary reasons identified for the second group's struggles, from the learners' perspective, were that they had either not read the article(s) thoroughly before the discussion, or they had a difficult time understanding the basic science concepts in the articles. More often, these learners were struggling to balance their time with the requirements for this elective course and the more stringent requirements of the rest of the curriculum (based on personal communication with learners). To facilitate discussion for learners who had not adequately prepared or who had difficulty comprehending the subject matter, the instructor either asked learners in the group who had read the articles to contribute to the discussion or would lead parts of the discussion himself. The second assessment component consisted of a short research paper that learners were required to write within 3 weeks of having led a research article discussion (20% of grade). After discussion of the research article, the leaders were required to gather several critiques and viewpoints regarding the study. Leaders were required to submit individual papers proposing a new hypothesis relevant to the discussion topic. Papers were required to include a brief overview of the question posed, pertinent background material, and an objective and study design describing how to test the hypothesis. Finally, the paper had to include an interpretation of potential outcomes including potential pitfalls of the proposed approach. For example, one hypothesis proposed by a learner was that a series of lectures on HIV/AIDS, which included the first-hand testimony of patients suffering from the disease, would be most effective in educating high school seniors of the dangers of the disease. Assessment criteria included the following: innovation (5 points), study design (5 points), study interpretation (5 points), and study pitfalls/alternative approaches (5 points). Most learners in both cohorts performed well on this assignment (12 As in the first cohort and 13 As in the second), and in their short papers, several offered novel approaches to studying a particular aspect of the disease pathogenesis, epidemiology, or treatment, based on the knowledge they gained from the research article discussions. However, most learners struggled with determining potential pitfalls of their proposed approach, suggesting they needed more practice assessing longterm consequences of their ideas.",

Many learners reported the presentation was the easiest assignment, since typically, general information about the selected disease was easily available on the Internet. Some examples of presentation topics include Cholera, Hantavirus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, Diphtheria, and Measles.

What contributions could you make to the team and what advice can you offer?\" While the examination was a final opportunity to test learners on how well they had honed their critical-thinking skills, it was also meant to allow the learners to self-reflect on how well-prepared they saw themselves as health care professionals with expertise that may be necessary in the event of a disease outbreak.

The second aim was to develop a course format that would give learners an opportunity to learn how to review and analyze the scientific literature, develop critical-thinking skills, design scientific studies, and effectively communicate their findings and perspectives with their peers, thus taking charge of their own scientific learning. Nationally, schools of pharmacy have placed an important emphasis on the development of courses that encourage critical thinking and literature analysis by learners. [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] The 2011-2012 Argus Commission, composed of the past five presidents of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), was specifically tasked with developing strategies to increase an attitude of inquisitiveness and scholarly thinking in pharmacists. 60 Similarly, the combined report of the 2005-2006 Argus Commission and various committees suggested that \"problem-based learning and case discussion exercises are learning formats which stimulate problem-solving and critical thinking skill development.\" 61 The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) Standards 2016 place an emphasis on development of electives that permit exploration of and/or advanced study in areas of professional interest (Standards 10.9 and 10.12). 62 Moreover, the standards emphasize both the incorporation of the study of infectious diseases with a focus on microbiology, pathophysiology, immunology, and therapeutics, as well as the management of diseases from a public health perspective. 62 The design of the course helped raise learners' awareness levels regarding infectious diseases. Many learners had never heard of some of the diseases covered in the course. Several learners mentioned in class that they were shocked to learn about the extent of MDR-TB in various parts of the world or read about the ease of using anthrax as a bioterrorism agent in the United States. One particular learner became so concerned about extensively drug-resistant TB that she not only gave a comprehensive oral presentation on the state of the crisis, but also took steps to interact with her peers to educate them about the problems of antibiotic resistance. When episodes of Ebola hit the United States this year, several learners told the instructor how relevant and important the elective had been for them. One learner made specific mention of this to the entire classroom during the infectious disease module in the IPC and PM curriculum (of which the instructor is a co-instructor). Thus, learners appeared to have benefited from learning about emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.",

While learning outcomes 2, 3, and 4 were routinely achieved during the research article discussion sessions, learners were constantly reminded throughout the course to incorporate learning outcomes 1 and 5 in the 4 major assessment categories. For example, learning outcome 5 states learners should be able to propose scientific, cultural, religious, or governmental solutions with the eventual aim of curbing the spread of the disease. This outcome was assessed in the 4 major assessment categories (except peer evaluation). During research article discussions, learners routinely discussed alternative approaches to the study. Similarly, the research paper was specifically geared toward assessing this objective, requiring learners to propose a novel hypothesis or study design pursuant to the research article discussions. While this often included the testing of a novel drug target, learners also proposed studies that would assess the impact or consequences of cultural, religious, or governmental innovations in treatment and management of the disease. For example, in one of the research papers submitted on Ebola virus infection, a learner proposed working with the governments of nations in the sub-Saharan region to break down political barriers for funding, educating the public about proper hygiene, especially with respect to taking care of the deceased, dispelling religious superstitions and myths about the infection, and allaying fears about \"white scientists covered in gowns and masks.\" Similarly, outcomes 1 and 5 also were emphasized during the oral presentations. For example, a learner showed a video on how proper hygiene is critical in controlling the spread of cholera in the underdeveloped world and how pharmacists in endemic regions can play a role in educating the public. Lastly, learners were assessed on outcome 5 during the final examination. For example, learners were required to design a study surveying the use of antibiotics in the community or to propose novel measures that could be taken during a bioterrorism attack.",

Their findings indicated that \"public health officials may face several challenges to compliance, including misinformation about the contagiousness of inhalation anthrax; fears about personal safety in crowds; distrust of government agencies to provide sufficient, safe, and effective medicine; and hesitation about ingesting antibiotic pills after receiving them.\" During the discussion of the article, a specific emphasis was placed on what roles pharmacists could play to alleviate the concerns of the public and how they could assist public health officials in meeting these challenges. For example, one suggestion offered by learners was that pharmacists could provide handouts in their communities regarding \"facts about inhalation anthrax\" and the \"efficacy of antibiotics.\" Other suggestions included: pharmacist-conducted clinics where the community would be provided with antibiotics, pharmacist participation in public health response teams, and a panel of health care professionals that would provide seminars to the public.",

Discussions were awesome and made everyone try to think out of the box, and from different points of view.Best class I've taken at WNE.Interesting and informative course, enjoyed the discussion based format.This was a good course, it was one of the courses that helped me learn and think more than other courses have. Overall this course was the best elective choice! It was mainly student run (ie, we made presentations and led discussions) which helped us learn from each other and to have to teach one another. It was a great way to set up the elective! Helped bring together previous course material together.Going through the articles on the various infectious diseases helped understand the learning of each disease.A fun and intellectually challenging course that really helps give perspective on emerging infectious disease and public health. The course was a great elective that gave me better insight into several emerging infectious diseases that exist across the world. It gave me a better understanding of how these diseases should be approached in the areas of prevention, treatment, etc. The discussion approach of the class made it a very relaxing course that I looked forward to attending every week.I see this class as more of a think tank. It allowed room for intellectual growth and discussion.This is definitely a class that the more you put into the class the more you get out of the class. I genuinely enjoyed preparing for class and the discussions that we had in class.Great course to be offered, and should be a choice for the incoming years. Course provides a window in to emerging diseases that are/would not be discussed in other courses. The course itself also provided more practice in reading journal articles and case studies, which is very helpful and useful! Very interesting topics. I really enjoyed the small class size with interactive discussions.Really liked how he let us choose our own articles and presentations. I loved the class, it was certainly the best I've taken so far at WNE. I learned a lot about topics of importance! A1 Great guidance, given that the most of class is student run. A little more clarity in the write up would be great. As for peer evaluations, it would be great to allow students to read the feedback to help improve presentations in the future. I thoroughly enjoyed partaking in this class. I learned a lot of ID and I'm sure everyone will enjoy taking this elective. LOVED this class and its open format. Learned a lot and had fun.",
