            "text": "Previous studies have shown that replication in vitro of the porcine parvovirus (PPV) isolate, KBSH, was restricted at 39 \u00b0C but not at 37 \u00b0C. In contrast, replication of the Kresse isolate was restricted at 37 \u00b0C but not at 39 \u00b0C. In this study, Kresse and KBSH isolates were passaged up to ten times in swine testicle (ST) cells at non-permissive temperatures, and at subsequent passage viral protein synthesis, viral DNA synthesis, and progeny virus were evaluated. KBSH became adapted for replication at 39 \u00b0C upon serial passages, displaying an appreciable increase in viral progeny, viral polypeptides, and viral DNA concentration. This finding was also observed with Kresse virus isolate continuously passaged at 37 \u00b0C. Neither isolate became adapted for replication at 32 \u00b0C. In an attempt to examine the effect of in vitro passage at non-permissive temperatures on pathogenicity in swine, KBSH passaged 10 times either at 37 \u00b0C or 39 \u00b0C was inoculated into swine fetuses. Two of four fetuses inoculated with 39\u00b0C-passaged KBSH were dead and hemorrhagic or mummified. All four fetuses inoculated with 39 \u00b0C-KBSH contained viral antigen and viral DNA. In contrast, fetuses inoculated with 37 \u00b0C-passaged KBSH, or with cell culture fluid were normal in appearance. Viral antigen and viral DNA were not demonstrated in fetuses inoculated with 37 \u00b0C-KBSH or cell culture fluids. These findings suggest the possibility that the ability to replicate at 39 \u00b0C is associated with virulence in swine fetuses.",

NADL-8 and NADL-2 are isolates pathogenic only to mid-term gestation fetuses [18, 23] when inoculated in utero. These two isolates showed similar replication patterns at 32 \u00b0C, 37 \u00b0C, and 39 \u00b0C. However, replication of KBSH, an isolate which is not pathogenic to swine fetuses [21] , was restricted at 39 \u00b0C, but not at 32 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C. The replication of Kresse, an isolate which is pathogenic both to mid-and late-term fetuses as well as to young pigs [3, 16] , was favored at 39 \u00b0C and restricted at 32 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C.",

High infectious virus titers, 5 x 10 6 t o 8 X 10 6 FFU/0.1 ml, were maintained at 39 \u00b0C through 10 passages for Kresse isolate replication (Fig. 1A) .

Furthermore, bands corresponding to polypeptide Vp3 were more intense at 39 \u00b0C than at 37 \u00b0C for both isolates.

This study was prompted by previous work that showed markedly different replication patterns in Kresse and KBSH isolates at 32 \u00b0C, 37 \u00b0C, and 39 \u00b0C [5] . Multiple passages of Kresse isolate at 37 \u00b0C and KBSH at 39 \u00b0C yielded higher titers of infectious virus compared to those of non-passaged isolates. However, at 32 \u00b0C, low titers of infectious virus were produced up to the 10th passage with Kresse isolate, and decreased infectious virus titer was observed with the KBSH isolate. These findings indicate that two isolates ofPPV passaged 10 times became adapted for growth at 37 \u00b0C or 39 \u00b0C. Neither isolate became adapted to growth at 32 \u00b0C, following 10 passages. This finding may be due to the slow doubling times of ST cells at 32 \u00b0C rather than an inability to replicate at such temperature.",

Previous studies indicated that restricted replication at a non-permissive temperature may be due to a defect in virus assembly for KBSH, but replication of Kresse appeared to be compromised at the initial stage of replication [5] . Since KBSH had been passaged more than 300 times in KB cells [11] and ST cells at 37 \u00b0C [21] , and Kresse had been passaged only 3 times in ST cells at 37 \u00b0C, a possible explanation for temperature dependent replication of each isolate is that one phenotype which can grow at 37 \u00b0C for KBSH or at 39 \u00b0C for Kresse became dominant in the virus preparation. It is possible that these virus preparations consist of two populations of mixed phenotypes. By passage at a non-permissive temperature, phenotypes which can grow at non-permissive temperatures might be generated and became dominant by natural selection. It is unlikely that reversion is caused by mutation because reversion occurred at low passages (less than 10 times). In a previous report [21] , KBSH was not pathogenic to swine fetuses when inoculated in utero with KBSH. However, it could not be excluded that KBSH upon blind passage in swine fetuses may cause fetal death. The role of DI particles in selection mechanism for reversion remains unknown due to a paucity of information on DI particles of PPV.",

Although polypeptides corresponding to Vp3 were more intense at 39 \u00b0C than at 37 \u00b0C for both Kresse and KBSH, progeny virus titers were comparable. In PPV, the ratio of empty to full virus particles in cell cultures are often greater than 50:1 in cell culture systems compared to 1 : 1 following experimental infection in animals [4] . Previous studies showed that inhibition of PPV replication by empty particles were dependent upon the concentration of empty particles present in virus preparation in celt cultures and in animals [-4 ].

This result can be supported by previous reports that the replication at near the body temperatures were correlated with virulence in poliovirus [17] and mouse corona virus [15] . Compared to experimental fetal infection with NADL-8 or Kresse isolate [3, 16] , fetal abnormalities were less severe. One of the explanations for this may be the age of fetuses. Joo et al. [14] suggested that the most susceptible age to PPV infection was between 32 and 56 days of gestational age. The age of swine fetuses used in this study was between 55 and 60 days. It should be noted that in difference to NADL-8, Kresse isolate is highly pathogenic in late term swine fetuses [3] . Another possibility is that there was insufficient adaptation following 10 passages to induce fetal death in late gestational age swine. Further experiments with virus passaged greater than 10 times and fetuses at various gestational ages will address this question. KBSH stock virus used in this study was not end-point cloned. Because a markedly different growth profile was observed between KBSH and Kresse [5] , this study was focussed on the pathogenic changes of these isolates upon serial passages at nonpermissible temperatures. It may be valuable to characterize the mixed clones by end-point cloning for further study.",

The adaptation was evidenced by increased viral antigen, viral polypeptides, expecially Vp3, viral DNA, and infectious virus. Furthermore, KBSH isolate passaged at 39 \u00b0C for 10 times now showed the ability to replicate in swine fetuses, indicating that pathogenicity can be recovered by serial adaptation at the mean body temperature of pigs, 39 \u00b0C.",
