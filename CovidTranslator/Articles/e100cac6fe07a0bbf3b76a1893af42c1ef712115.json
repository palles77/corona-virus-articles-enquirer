Although immune mechanisms operate in many disease processes of the central nervous sy.stem (CNS), cells of the CNS generally express low levels of HLA molecules. In this study, the potential for upregulation of HLA molecules on adult human glial ceils was examined. Moreover, the functional implication of this upregulation was assessed by the capacity of glial cells to process and present target antigens to HLA class I-restricted influenza-specific and class II-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific CTL lines. Glial cells cultured from adult human surgical brain specimens or cells from established glioblastoma multiforrne cell lines were studied. Lysis by antigen-specific CTLs was dependent on treatment of the target cell with interferon-y. The lysis was HLA restricted and antigen specific. The results indicate that adult human glial cells can process and present antigen to HLA-restricted CTLs but require the upregulation of HLA molecules. These findings have implications for infectious and autoimmune diseases of the CNS.",

            "text": "Antigen-specific T-lymphocytes are believed to be involved in the production of immunopathological disease of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (Mokhtarian et al., 1984; Fontana et al., 1987) . Direct damage of tissue by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) requires recognition of a processed antigen on the target cell in the context of the appropriate HLA determinants (Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1974; Sun et al., 1988) . This process may be limited in the CNS, since brain cells express very low levels of HLA molecules (Williams et al., 1980) . Expression of these molecules can be upregulated in murine glial cell cultures by interferon--/ (IFN--/) (Wong et al., 1984) or virus infection (Massa et al., 1986) which allows these cells to function as antigenpresenting cells (APC) . Animal experiments have demonstrated that mouse endothelial cells (Mc-Carron et al., 1985) and rat astrocytes (Fontana et al., 1984) can present myelin basic protein (MBP) to encephalitogenic T-cell lines. These lines have been shown to lyse MBP-treated rat astrocytes in an antigen-specific and Ia-restricted fashion (Sun and Wekerle, 1986 ). In addition, inducibility of Ia on rat astrocytes has been found to be strain dependent (Massa et al., 1987) . While these findings indicate that native cells of the newborn murine CNS can present self antigen to T-cells, it is uncertain if similar processes occur in cells of the adult human brain and whether these cells can process and present viral antigen to CTLs. Moreover, there is evidence that certain cells such as keratinocytes and epithelial cells can be induced to express Ia molecules but are incapable of processing and presenting antigen to T-cells (Geppert and Lipsky, 1985) . In this study, the capacity of adult human glial cells to express HLA molecules and to acquire antigen-presenting function was examined by their ability to serve as targets for HLA class I-and class II-restricted CTLs.",

The presence of oligodendrocytes was not examined in the cultures used in this study. However, examination of subsequent cultures established from different brains under similar conditions indicated the presence of less than 5% of cells that react with antibodies to the oligodendrocyte markers galactocerebroside (gift from Dr. M. Dubois-Dalcq) and MBP (Dakopatts). Cells reacting with antibodies to Von Willebrand factor (an endothelial cell marker) were not observed in these cultures. Approximately 50% of the GFAP-positive cells constitutively expressed low levels of HLA class I molecules ( Fig.  1A and B) and less than 5% expressed HLA class II (DR) molecules ( Fig. 1E and F) , but expression could be upregulated on these cells up to 90% for both class I and class II DR by treatment with IFN--/ 100 units/ml for 3 days (Fig. 1C , D, and G, H).

Fibroblasts were rarely detected in cultures less than 3 weeks old, but they increased in number, thereafter. Consequently, 2-to 3-week-old cultures were employed in order to study antigen presentation by glial cells. Under basal conditions, 50% of GFAP + cells expressed class I HLA molecules but only 5% expressed class II molecules. Both fluorescence intensity and number of cells expressing HLA molecules were increased by IFN-y treatment.

Since both viral and auto-antigens have been implicated in the development of autoimmune disease (Fontana et al., 1987) , presentation of these antigens by primary human glial cells was studied. The present data suggest that primary mixed glial cell cultures can function as targets for antigen-specific CTL. As shown in Fig. 2B and C, the ability of these cells to function as targets for MBP CTL is dependent on treatment of the targets with IFN-7 which results in upregulation of HLA molecules. IFN-y also has been shown to upregulate the expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on routine astrocytes which could contribute to more effective lysis of these cells (Frohman et al., 1989) . Since the primary adult human glial cells contained nonastrocytic cell types such as microglia, the extent of 51Cr release attributable to each cell population was uncertain. Therefore, either astrocytes or rnicroglia or both could have functioned as targets for CTL. Attempts to separate the astrocytes and 209 microglial cells have been hampered by the limited number of cells that can be obtained from adult brain tissue.",

Such evidence is derived from the immunohistochemical demonstration of class II HLA molecules on astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells in lesions of brains affected with multiple sclerosis or EAE (McCarron et al., 1985; Hayes et al., 1987; Traugott, 1987; Grenier et al., 1989) . Studies addressing the functional capacity of these CNS cells to present antigen to T-cells have been conducted in marine systems and have largely focused on MBP (Fontana et al., 1984; McCarron et al., 1985; Sun and Wekerle, 1986) . The present study suggests that adult human astrocytes and/or microglia can present viral or auto-antigen to cytotoxic T-cells. In addition, the results obtained with the GFAP + cell line U-251 MG support a role for astrocytic cells in presenting antigen to T-cells. These findings have implications for pathogenic mechanisms involved in the development of autoimmune diseases of the CNS. HLA molecules induced on glial cells by IFN--y released during inflammation could render these cells capable of presenting antigen to T-cells. Gliai cells could then play a role in the induction of an immune response within the CNS or become targets for CTL.",

            "text": "Finally, there is increasing interest in intracerebral transplantation of fetal tissue for patients with Parkinson's disease. Experimental evidence in rats suggests that microglia may participate in the immunological reaction to xenografts by functioning as antigen-presenting cells (Poltorak and Freed, 1989) . Moreover, adult human mixed glial cell cultures have been shown to induce an allogeneic T-cell response (Grenier et al., 1989) . The present findings suggest that human glial cells potentially can participate in the immunological reaction to intracerebral transplants under conditions that would lead to upregulation of HLA molecules,",
