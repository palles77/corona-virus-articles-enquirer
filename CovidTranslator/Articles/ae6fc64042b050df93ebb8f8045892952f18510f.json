While the concept of identify, 26 isolate, and treat is not new in terms of controlling an outbreak [4] the scales at which it is 27 currently being used is. A problem for a situation such as the COVID-19 outbreak is that many 28 novel pathogens show symptoms that are similar to common infections, e.g., general respiratory 29 symptoms. Since general respiratory symptoms are common, a MSTI can quickly overload the 30 health system [5] . Strained health facilities mean reduced care for individuals with other health 31 needs. In addition, such a situation might directly lead to a worsening of the outbreak, due to 32 increased transmission at testing sites [6, 7] . We explore how the latter risk affects the potential 33 benefit of MSTI. 34",
