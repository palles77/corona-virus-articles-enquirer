One efficient tactic is to divert host immune responses toward an immunodominant decoy epitope and to induce non-neutralizing antibodies toward this epitope. Therefore, it is expected that the amount of decoy epitope in a subunit vaccine can affect the level of neutralizing antibody in an immunized animal. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by generating an antibody specific to the decoy epitope on the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Using this antibody, we found that two commercial vaccines contained statistically different amounts of the decoy epitope. The vaccine with lower levels of decoy epitope induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibody after immunization. This antibody can be used as an analytical tool to monitor the quality of a vaccine from batch to batch.",

One such tactic is to divert the host immune response with a decoy.

Because a recombinant mutant capsid protein (CP) with a deleted decoy epitope induced a higher level of virusneutralizing antibody than wild type proteins [11] , it was expected that higher levels of decoy epitope in a prepared batch of subunit vaccine would decrease its efficacy. However, it was not possible to test this hypothesis by measuring levels of decoy epitope in a vaccine because an antibody specific to the decoy epitope was not readily available.",

The only structural protein of this virus is a 28-kD CP, which includes major antigenic determinants that can be used in subunit vaccines [13] . A previous study showed that an epitope composed of amino acid residues 169e180 (CP 169e180 ) is the most immunodominant among these antigenic determinants [11] . Because this epitope is buried inside the virus-like particle (VLP) structure (Fig. 1A) , antibodies to this epitope cannot react with the intact virus, and therefore are non-neutralizing [14] . As expected, PCV infection elicited a humoral response to the CP 169e180 epitope and drove the production of non-neutralizing antibodies [15] . Therefore, previous infection with PCV decreased the vaccines prevention of the future infections.",

To rectify this, we generated a monoclonal antibody specific to the immunodominant CP 169e180 epitope from an antibody library generated using chickens immunized with CP 169e180 peptide. This recombinant anti-CP 169e180 antibody preferentially reacted to delN CP with an exposed CP 169e180 epitope compared to VLP in an enzyme immunoassay (Fig. 1B) . Because the length of linear B-cell epitopes can vary widely from 3 to 38 amino acids [37] , we confirmed that CP 169e180 peptides behave as a single epitope in a competition enzyme immunoassay. The recombinant CP 169e180 antibody almost completely inhibited the binding of PCV2-infected pig sera to CP 169e180 peptide.",

From the measured level of decoy epitope, we could predict the efficacy of a vaccine for the induction of neutralizing antibody titer. We believe that anti-CP 169e180 antibody can be used to monitor the varying quality of the subunit vaccine from batch to batch. Fig. 2 . Recombinant anti-CP 169e180 antibody inhibited the binding of naturally occurring antibody. After pre-incubation with sera from the non-infected (A) and infected pigs (B) with anti-CP 169e180 antibody (n \u00bc 3/group), the mixtures were added to a CP 169e180 peptide-coated microtiter plate. The amount of bound porcine antibody was measured by HRP-conjugated anti-porcine IgG antibody. Absorbance was measured at 650 nm. The results are the means \u00b1 standard deviations from the experiments, which were conducted in triplicate using the sera from three pigs (P1, P2, and P3 in each group).",
