            "text": "Chemokines play a pivotal role in the innate response to both bacterial and viral infections, and in mixed infections. To determine chemokine responses to Sindbis virus (SIN) in a co-infection model, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from healthy volunteers were exposed to SIN in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Culture supernatants recovered at 2, 24, and 72 h post-exposure were evaluated for virus replication and analyzed for chemokines by ELISA. None of the PBMC cultures showed new virus release, GFP reporter expression, or viral RNA synthesis. While SIN had little effect on the induction of IL-8 and RANTES, the chemokines MCP-1, MIP1-a ( p < 0.001), and MIP1-b ( p < 0.0004) were drastically upregulated by SIN as well as LPS. Both live and UV-inactivated SIN induced secretion of IP-10 and I-TAC. Although LPS did not induce release of IP-10, it sharply inhibited ( p \u00bc 0.004) SIN-mediated IP-10 secretion. On the contrary, the release of SLC was blocked by SIN. The adjuvant activity of IP-10, its antiangiogenic function, and antagonism between SIN and LPS for the release of select chemokines may be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of mixed infections, cross-talk between cellular pathways, and may have applications in cancer and sepsis.",

Occasionally, it causes fever and arthralgia in humans that is much milder than Chikungunya arthritis (13) . Genetically-engineered RNA genomes of alphaviruses including Sindbis virus (SIN), Semliki Forest Virus (SFV), and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEE) are extensively used as viral vectors (8, 28) , and as oncolytic agents (37) . Using mouse models, the inflammatory response including type I interferons, TNF-a, and IFN-g to alphaviruses have been well studied (12, 32) . Strikingly, chemokines appear to contribute to alphavirus pathogenesis and arthralgia (31) . In the present work, we examined the chemokine response of human peripheral blood mononu-clear cells (PBMCs) to SIN exposure. The bacterial component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is one of the best studied TLR-4 ligands in inflammation research (2, 14) . LPS downregulates interferon induction by blocking virus-induced phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IRF-7 (15) . We hypothesized that LPS might alter SIN-induced chemokine release and vice versa, and this knowledge may shed light on the pathogenesis of mixed infections.",

Each type of receptor can bind to several chemokines, and each chemokine can bind to more than one receptor. Both bacterial and viral infections induce common and distinct chemokines (10) . The CXC chemokine IP-10 is induced by type I and type II interferons, and is secreted from monocytes and other cell types (11, 21) . In addition to bacterial and viral infections, IP-10 is expressed at high levels in autoimmune disorders (10, 38) . Since alphaviruses are an important cause of arthralgia, the study of virus-induced chemokine expression may be relevant (31) .

The virus was further purified by ultracentrifugation of culture fluid for 2 h at 30 K rpm under a 20% sucrose cushion. Both sucrosecushion purified and the parental virus preparations behaved similarly. UV-inactivation of virus particles was carried out in a Bio-Rad UV-chamber (program C4x2; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Endotoxin testing of virus preparations was carried out using the Kinetic Chromogenic Assay Kit using LAL reagent (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) per the manufacturer's protocol, and were found to be less than 0.005-0.0068EU/million pfu of virus or UVinactivated virus equivalents. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay with serially diluted virus stock on Vero cell monolayers. No infectious virus was detectable even in undiluted UV-inactivated virus preparations.",

The levels of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL10 found in SIN-exposed PBMC cultures appear to correlate with those observed in mouse models of virus infection (6) . The release of chemokines by SIN-exposed PBMCs in the absence of significant virus replication, mirrors the results obtained from other enveloped viruses (5, 33, 39) . The absence of GFP reporter expression, new viral RNA synthesis as determined by qPCR, and viral particle release, are also suggestive of very poor replication of engineered SIN (Toto1101) in PBMCs.

            "text": "In addition to IFN-g, IFN-a also induces IP-10 synthesis (24). LPS inhibits virus-mediated IFN-a gene expression in human fibroblasts (15) . In our experiments, PBMCs exposed to SIN readily produced IFN-a that was also blocked by LPS; however, no IFN-g was released by SIN (unpublished data). Therefore, it appears that IFN-a signaling could account for IP-10 induction in PBMCs exposed to SIN, since LPS blocked SIN-induced IP-10 release. Notably, Proost et al. (27) reported that IP-10 expression in human PBMCs was induced by dsRNA, and that this induction was blocked by LPS. In our present experiments, IP-10 release occurred in the absence of significant RNA replication, so dsRNA may not be the inducer of IP-10. As indicated previously for fibrobalsts (7, 25) , the virus particle-mediated immune response appears to account for the chemokine release from PBMCs by SIN. It remains to be established if viral capsid protein can induce IP-10 through activation of NF-kB, as shown for adenovirus (4) .",

The signaling pathways involved in the host response to viral and bacterial pathogens also appear to overlap (26) . The use of LPS and other TLR ligands in SIN infections may help unravel signaling cross-talk between different pathways. Viral RNA can be recognized by TLR3 and 7, and cytoplasmic helicases (16) . A TLR7 agonist has recently been reported to downregulate polymicrobial sepsis, suggesting viral infections might have a protective effect against bacterial toxicity (17) . The adjuvant activity of IP-10 (19) , and its induction by SIN, may strengthen the use of SIN particles in vaccine delivery applications (18) . The inhibition of angiogenesis by IP-10 (3) may partly explain the actively pursued oncolytic activity of SIN (37) , and thereby promote its potential use in cancer therapeutics.",
