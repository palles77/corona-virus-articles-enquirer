            "text": "Since late 2010, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been re-emerging in immunized swine herds with devastating impact in the Hebei province of China. Seven prevailing strains of PEDV were isolated from fecal samples out of piglets suffering from severe diarrhea. The M gene of the seven PEDV isolates encompasses an open reading frame of 681 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 226 amino acids. The seven PEDV isolates showed 99.4-99.9 % nucleotide sequence identity and 98.2-99.1 % deduced amino acid identity. When compared with other Chinese isolates and foreign isolates, the seven isolates showed high nucleotide identity with the Thailand isolate M-NIAH1005 (99.6-99.9 %) and Korea isolate PFF188 (99.7-100 %), but low identity with other Chinese isolates (96.6-99.1 %) and with the vaccine strain CV777 used in China (97.8-98.2 %). Phylogenetic analyses showed that all seven Chinese field isolates were grouped together in the same cluster. Although CV777 was also separated into the same cluster with the seven isolates, they were belonged to different sub-cluster. These results showed that the seven prevailing isolates in China are closely related phylogenetically to each other and have close relationships with the Korean strain PFF188 and Thailand strain M_NIAH1005. However, they differ genetically from other Chinese isolates and the vaccine strain CV777. Therefore, a more efficient vaccine strain should be chosen to prevent outbreaks of PEDV in China.",

Its genome contains genes for the spike (S), membrane (M), small membrane (sM), open reading frame (ORF) 3, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2, 4] . The M protein is a structural membrane glycoprotein and the most abundant of all the envelope proteins. It has a short amino-terminal domain on the outside of the virion and a long carboxy-terminal domain on the inside. The M protein plays a central role in PEDV assembly. Together with the sM protein, it is responsible for assembly of the PEDV envelope [1, 9, 21] . In addition, the M protein directs the incorporation of the S protein [13, 15] and the nucleocapsid [12] into the budding particle.",

PEDV was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1978. Since then, outbreaks of the disease have been reported in several swine-raising countries, most notably in Europe and Asia, including Japan, China, and Korea [11] . It causes heavy economic losses in the European and Asian swine industry and is an important gastrointestinal disease [7, 16] . Several vaccines have been applied to the regions with a high prevalence of PEDV, but these vaccines have not been completely effective in preventing the disease [6, 18] . Since early 2006, PEDV has been re-emerging in immunized swine herds in China [5, 20] . In late 2010, outbreaks of PED occurred in HeBei province. Pigs of all ages were affected and losses from this disease outbreak were extensive. Most of the affected farms lost 100 % of their newborn piglets. In order to identify the genetic heterogeneity of the prevailing strains in China, PEDV strains were isolated from fecal samples from piglets infected with PEDV in 2010. The M genes were cloned and sequenced for analysis of genetic diversity, and the phylogenetic relationships of the field isolates with other PEDV reference strains were also analyzed.",

Although the bi-combined attenuated vaccine against TGEV and PEDV infection is authorized for use on swine farms, PED still occurs in the immunized swine herds in China. Since late 2010, outbreaks of PED have occurred in Hebei province. Most of the affected farms lost 100 % of their newborn piglets. PEDV is known to have only one serotype, but the genome shows wide genetic diversity [3, 10, 22] . The structural M protein of PEDV plays an important role in the assembly process and induces virus neutralization antibodies [14] . Therefore it is necessary to investigate the prevalence of PEDV on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of the M gene of the field strains of PEDV in China.",

            "text": "This study was conducted to characterize PEDVs isolated from the fecal samples of piglets suffering from severe diarrhea in Hebei province of the People's Republic of China. The initial aim of this study was to isolate and investigate the genetic diversity among field strains of PEDV in China. A large amount of sequence data on PEDVs isolated throughout the world has been published over the years and is now available for sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. In this study, seven Chinese field strains of PEDV were isolated. The complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the M gene were determined and compared with those of the reference strains. None of the seven isolates were found to have sequence insertions or deletions in the M genes, although all the PEDV isolates investigated in this study had nucleotide mutations. Analysis of sequence homology showed that the seven PEDV isolates were closely related to PFF188, M-NIAH1005, and JS-2004. Furthermore, HB-HS and PFF188 had identical nucleotide sequences, although they were isolated in different countries at different times. This suggests that HB-HS might have been generated naturally from PFF188. However, lower amino acid identity was observed between the seven PEDV isolates and the Chinese isolates CH-IMT-06, HN/XYYYP, YM/2007. Phylogenetically, they belonged to three different clusters. Although the seven isolates and the other Table 1 . Tree topology was constructed using F84 model and bootstrap re-sampling (1,000 data sets) of the multiple alignments was used to test the statistical robustness of the trees obtained by NJ (using the program Neighbor from PHYLIP v3.69 package) d vaccine strain m epidemic strain Chinese isolates belonged to the same cluster, they were segregated into different sub-clusters. These results showed that a new genotype of PEDV prevails in China now. None of the seven PEDV isolates was phylogenetically close to the vaccine strain CV777 that is used in China. In fact, they were segregated into different sub-clusters. In addition, the seven Chinese isolates also had a change in the antigenic regions 2-14 though there has no scientific data to prove whether this change had brought about antigenic variation. All these results show that, in spite of the regular use of live vaccines in pigs, the seven field isolates of PEDV were of a different genotype able to cause outbreaks in immunized pigs in Hebei province. In conclusion, genetic variation exists in the M gene of the prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates, and a more appropriate vaccine strain should be chosen to prevent PEDV outbreaks in China.",

            "text": "2 %) were positive for PEDV, 20 out of 82 (24.4 %) for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), 14 out of 82 (17.1 %) for porcine rotavirus (PRV), and 38 out of 82 (46.3 %) for E. coli. E. coli positive cases were often positive for one other viral pathogen. From the 51 PEDV positive feces, Seven PEDV strains were isolated and their M genes were cloned.M gene sequence analysis Sequence analysis indicated that the nucleotide sequence of the M gene ORF of the seven PEDV isolates was 681 bp in length and encoded 226 amino acids. There were no deletions or insertions in the ORFs of the seven Chinese isolates. Compared with PEDV CV777, HB-HS had 12 nucleotide mutations, BJ2010 and HB-LF had 14 nucleotide mutations, and HB/FN, HB/BD, HB/GY, and HB/QY had 13 nucleotide mutations. These nucleotide mutations would lead to changes in the predicted amino acid sequences of the PEDV isolates. Compared with PEDV CV777, all seven field isolates had three amino acid changes (from E to Q at 13, from V to A at 42, from A to S at 214), in addition, BJ2010 had one further amino acid change (from T to A at 27), HB/FN had one amino acid change (from K to N at 48), HB/QY had one amino acid change (from Y to H at 198), HB/BD and HB/GY had one amino acid change (from S to A at 111), and HB/LF had two amino acid changes (from S to A at 111, from K to R at 202).TheM protein of the seven isolates had three transmembrane helices. They located in amino acid 20-38, 43-65, and 75-97 plots, respectively. 1-19 and 66-74 plots were outside the membrane while 39-42 and 98-226 plots were inside. The regions 2-13, 102-107, 112-118, 182-188, 200-206, and 216-221 had high antigenic index. Among the amino acid changes, those at 13 and 202 were located in the antigenic regions 2-14 and 200-206, respectively. It is uncertain now whether these changes led to the antigenic difference between the seven Chinese isolates and vaccine strain CV777. Further studies should focus on the relationship between them.",
