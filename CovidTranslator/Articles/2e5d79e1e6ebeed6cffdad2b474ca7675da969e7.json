Probable cases were 117 defined as residents or staff who had at least one episode of vomiting and/or three or more loose 118 stools within a 24-hour period. Confirmed cases were probable cases with a laboratory confirmed 119 norovirus infection.

First, as an outbreak 327 progresses and more individuals become ill and later immune, there is a natural decrease in the 328 proportion susceptible. However, we found that index cases generally had substantially greater 329 R Ei 's compared to cases with onset dates only a few days after outbreak initiation, before a 330 sufficient number of susceptibles could accumulate to explain this pattern. We also found that 331 R 0,1 (the basic reproduction number for index cases) tended to be substantially larger than R 0,2-4 332 (the basic reproduction numbers for cases on days 2-4), even under the extreme assumptions that 333 all individuals were initially susceptible and that the total population consisted only of reported 334 cases in the outbreak. If the observed declines in R Ei had been due to a natural decrease in 335 susceptibles alone, we would expect the calculated R 0i values to remain relatively constant over 336 time. Therefore, these results suggest that index cases are more infectious than subsequent cases 337 for reasons other than the natural decreases in susceptibles alone.

Lastly, we used a serial interval distribution estimated 373 from household transmission associated with norovirus outbreaks in child daycare centers in 374 Sweden and assumed a similar serial interval in our U.S. nursing homes. Unlike transmission in 375 the households, where it was clear that the child daycare center attendee/staff infected others in 376 the home, identifying transmission pairs in nursing home outbreaks is difficult, precluding direct 377 estimation of serial intervals in these settings. The true serial interval may be longer or shorter in 378 nursing homes. Regardless, we found that our main finding of the importance of vomiting in 379 transmission was robust when using different values of the serial interval. ",

The role of residents (vs. staff) in norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing homes may depend on the average level of mobility and dependency of residents. If nursing home residents are generally mobile, self-sufficient, and able to gather in communal rooms, they may be more likely than staff to contribute to norovirus transmission. We did not have information on residents' mobility or dependence on nursing care for this study, so were unable to include these variables in our analyses.We note a number of limitations of our study. First, all analyzed outbreaks took place in South Carolina, so results may not be generalizable to norovirus outbreaks in nursing homes in357 other U.S. states or elsewhere. Nursing home staffing levels vary widely across states [29], as do infection control training resources and healthcare-associated infection reporting [30]. Second, the probability model used to estimate R Ei is built on the following assumptions: transmission of 360 infection occurs only among reported cases, asymptomatic cases do not play a role in transmission, and all reported cases are part of the same outbreak. However, for norovirus, symptomatic cases may go unreported and asymptomatic cases could contribute to transmission.In particular, underreporting of cases in the early stages of an outbreak could lead to an overestimate of the infectiousness of index cases. Additionally, some reported cases could be sporadic or caused by a different etiologic agent. Furthermore, only the date of symptom onset, not time, was considered when calculating R Ei 's. Because norovirus has a relatively short incubation period, it is possible, although unlikely, for primary and secondary cases to have the same symptom onset date. The method we used to calculate R Ei assumes that such cases cannot",
