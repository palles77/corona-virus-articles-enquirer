Methods: The researchers conducted a focused review of the published literature describing how HIT can be used to support safe, patient-centred, coordinated care to patients who are affected by Ebola (an emerging disease). Results: New and emerging diseases present opportunities for repurposing existing technologies and for stimulating the development of new HIT innovation. Innovative technologies may be developed such as new software used for tracking patients during new or emerging disease outbreaks or by repurposing and extending existing technologies so they can be used to support patients, families and health professionals who may have been exposed to a disease. The paper describes the development of new technologies and the repurposing and extension of existing ones (such as electronic health records) using the most recent outbreak of Ebola as an example.",

Gulliford and colleagues [6] define patient-centred care as \"providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.\" When patient care is coordinated, healthcare teams can work more effectively together, supporting patient and family decision-making in all settings where the patient is cared for (e.g. physician office, home, hospital and long-term care). This in turn improves communication and coordination between health professionals, patients and their families, leading to improved quality of care. Health information technology (HIT) has been identified by the IOM (Institute Of Medicine) as a tool that can support communication and coordination of care, thereby improving patient-centred care [7] .",

In this paper we discuss how HIT can be repurposed and developed to provide patient-centered support to individuals who are affected by new/ emerging diseases or diseases about which we have limited knowledge or experience. We also discuss the future of technologies that will support patient-centred care in these contexts. Efforts around the Ebola virus will be used as an example. We will also consider some of the issues and challenges associated with addressing such diseases from a HIT perspective and how our learning's can be used to address emerging diseases and diseases that may require additional research to understand and treat into the future.",

            "text": "Patient-centred HIT in hospital settings is more researched, easily implemented and evaluated in comparison to the introduction of those HIT currently used to support treatment and management of patient-centred approaches towards the management of new/ emerging diseases [9] . Emerging diseases are not typically encountered by technology designers and HIT professionals. New and emergent diseases that we encounter today in our world of modern epidemics include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the Avian flu and Ebola [12] . The development of HIT that supports patient-centred care for those patients and families affected by new/emerging diseases, especially in regions of the world where HIT and health professionals have limited knowledge or experience with new/emerging diseases, is critical to developing and exchanging knowledge about these diseases [13] . Such technologies are also needed to support patients who are diagnosed with acute and chronic illnesses. Given the new and emergent nature of some diseases one might conclude that HIT used to support health professionals in the management of these diseases is less patient-centred and therefore less effective in supporting patient-centred care. Yet, HIT can evolve and be used to support the development of patient-centred care. For example, in the early days of the global outbreak of SARS, there was little known about the disease. Yet, health and biomedical informatics researchers developed electronic tools and repurposed existing technologies such as electronic health records (EHRs) to effectively support clinicians and biomedical researchers. Here, HIT researchers developed virtual environments where healthcare professionals could communicate, collaborate, and document information about the treatment and management of SARS [14] . This included patient-centred approaches to the management of the disease. Clinicians, patients and their families were involved in decision making even as new information about the prevention and management of this disease was emerging using electronic tools. This could only be done through HIT such as the Internet, EHRs, decision support systems, and virtual collaborative environments [15] . Today, the Ebola epidemic has presented the health and biomedical informatics community with similar challenges -to develop HIT that allow for exchange and communication across care settings which still allows for patient-centred care. In the next section of this paper we provide a brief background about Ebola.",

Public interest about emerging diseases often coincides with related news-making events such as the SARS, the Avian Flu and Ebola crisis in Africa.

However, the content presented on these sites at the time of the initial outbreak had limited value for patients. Archived versions of the WHO web site indicate that a prominent patient-centred focus has only been adopted seven months after the initial outbreak (retrieved though http://archive.org/web/). Before this time, patient information content was mixed with WHO news releases, guidelines for professionals, WHO partner organization, researchers and other audiences. The current WHO Web site has a clearly demarcated patient-centred section (along with two other sections, centered on providers and partner organizations, respectively). It leverages Web-based patient-centred communication tools such as Twitter and Facebook to propagate important health facts about the disease while it emerges. More localized information is posted on individual governmental Web sites. For example, the CDC provides focussed information content for parents, teachers, travelers, etc. The disease has also spawned the creation of new patient-centred Web communities that collect and make available disease-related information for the public, e.g., whebola.com, ebolafiles. com, ebolabreakoutnews.com. Notably, the emergence and popularity of many of these communities has bypassed the traditional Web (and Web search engines) and hinged on social networks instead. Whebola.com, for example, is not easily retrievable through classical Web search engines (like Google) but very prominent with searches on for #ebola on Twitter. This indicates the increasing importance of focussing on social networking technologies in patient-centric health information delivery. It also indicates that the growing reliance on social networks as a way to retrieve and communicate information has created new risks with respect to potential misinformation and patient safety. Innovative approaches to ensuring trustworthiness are required for navigating the social health Web.",

In truth, the EHR itself was not to blame, but the answer was likely more in the way the EHR collected and presented critical data to the medical team and the current state of organizational policies where the technology was concerned. The EHR should have helped to better identify a patient for whom a clinical concern should be raised, particularly when a disease is rare and not on the mind of providers (as was the case for the medical team in Dallas at the time). The concern was not that the critical data had not been collected, but that it had been placed in a relatively unobtrusive area that was easy to skip when the EHR was reviewed. This in turn led to confusion where the patient's international travel was recorded and whether the relevant information was effectively communicated to all members of the healthcare team (http://res.dallasnews.com/ interactives/duncan-timeline/). This would constitute an example of what Borycki and colleagues term a \"technology-induced\" error [31] , which is an error that results from human factors issues and deficiencies whereby a health information system may lead a health professional to make an error (which could be an error of omission, such as omitting to read key information, or commission). Such errors do not result from errors in programming but rather emerge in the complex interaction of health information systems with end users in the busy and often hurried context of clinical practice. Indeed a key aspect of both EHRs systems and public health systems is their level of usability, with systems and user interfaces that are difficult to navigate or use leading to a higher probability of technology-induced error [32] . In response to the problem in this example, the hospital then reported updating their EHR to collect additional screening information in a more rigorous fashion to help identify high-risk patients [33] .",

While patient or disease specific support is difficult to implement initially in an integrated manner, this method of providing decision support has the benefit of being relatively easy to edit and can be amended with new science or known screening questions once integrated, therefore providing a quick implementation strategy for the identification of emerging diseases.",

When coded information is collected in the EHR about travel or other designated related screening information, an active pop-up alert for patients such as the one illustrated in figure 2, can be displayed to the relevant provider to acknowledge the risks and initiate any desired behaviours or treatment pathway. As passive decision support, additional reminders can be added to the patient's chart in the form of informational banners or highlights. This system would work with the existing workflow of providers but interrupt (through the active alert) only when patients screen positive. It also has the drawback that it needs to be adjusted. In this specific case, when patients traveled to one of four specific countries, the alert fires. If, as is prevalent in infectious disease, the countries or risk factors change, the coding behind the alert must change as well. This requires more programming support. Also-if the list of risk factors grows very large (in our example, if the list of affected Ebola countries were to swell to 10-20 countries) the electronic screening would likely be much less accurate. Here, one could look towards international organizations such as the World Health Organization to maintain and update DSS content about Ebola using a service oriented architecture approach [40] .",

If the initial nurse for Ebola patient zero had gotten an alert on her screen when she documented western African travel, we can all assume the initial emergency department visit would have looked much different. Decision support can be one tool to help busy providers remember to screen for rare events, and give direct messaging when such a screening is positive. Alternatively, providers should also be made aware of the potential for false alarms or false positives. Here, clinicians must rely on further assessment and their clinical judgement to ascertain the presence or absence of a disease. The future of this type of support lies in leveraging systems that work with devices that patients already use, for example, smart phones. If some screening questions could be answered by text on a patient's own device and integrated into the EHR possibly even before presentation, this would increase the power and flexibility or this type of decision support.",

This work as also been extended to the use of algorithms that search narrative text within EHRs [49] .

A data field such as whether a patient has travelled abroad may not be significant in usual scenarios but in the case of a disease outbreak it becomes far more significant. Clinicians often work in complex contextual conditions. Regardless of whether the Texas Ebola patient communicated information about his travels in Liberia, West Africa, in a stressful emergency room setting it can be difficult for a clinician to properly process all the requisite information. HIT needs to be designed with sufficient flexibility to enable alerts and reminders to be quickly configured to raise attention to relevant data fields and to ensure the fields are communicated appropriately. To design HIT to support monitoring and management of disease outbreaks will require a rethinking in HIT. More specifically, we need to better incorporate context in HIT design (i.e. physician office, hospital etc.). Contextual rethinking needs to be done.",

Such systems are being developed to integrate information from multiple sources including information about prior disease cases with EHR data and new incoming data about specific client cases and epidemic spread. The SARS epidemic fuelled the creation and deployment of such systems in Canada and internationally. However, the usability and effectiveness of such systems will need to be considered and optimized for them to achieve their promise. This includes consideration of providing the most effective user interfaces for entering new data (e.g. from points of entry in a country, offices, and clinical settings across regions or countries), retrieving patient and case data, and also for providing effective and timely alerting about potential epidemics, disease spread and counter measures. To address these challenges, methods from usability engineering [50] are beginning to be applied throughout the systems development life cycle of health surveillance systems to ensure their design and deployment are effective and such systems lead to adoption and proper use when epidemics and public health emergencies arise. This has included usability inspection of the user interfaces of such systems, usability testing involving observing representative users of such systems (e.g. public health officers, clinicians, managers etc.) and clinical simulations, where systems are tested under simulated conditions and environments (e.g. simulations of public health emergencies) [31] . In addition, software and applications targeted for use by the public should be optimized by applying usability engineering principles and methods to ensure information can be retrieved and user interfaces are both usable and understandable.",

Information about a new or emerging disease may also change on an hourly or even a daily basis as new information emerges about the treatment of the disease and is communicated among country, state and provincial governments. In some cases international and national agencies may provide collaborative tools that allow for health professionals to exchange information and experiences with these emerging diseases to enhance development of protocols (as in the case of SARS where international experts around the world worked together on understanding how to best identify and treat the disease) [14, 15] . On a local healthcare organizational level (e.g. hospital, clinic, long term care facility), technologies that have policies, procedures and processes embedded within electronic health records may not be consistent with emerging international and national knowledge about the disease. These technologies may in turn lead health professionals to engage in activities and workflows that are not consistent with the current knowledge of the disease. Healthcare organizations must modify their technologies to support disease management. This is a continuous, iterative process as information about the emerging disease is pushed out by international organizations and governments via websites and social media and healthcare organizations respond by modifying their HIT to reflect these changes in order to support health professional decision-making and work activities.",

Such activities require that health informatics and HIT departments modify existing electronic tools (e.g. electronic screening, emergency room triage tools, clinical documentation, DSS, and laboratory and pharmacy information systems) to account for any additional/new laboratory tests, medications and other interventions that need to be employed with every new patient and their family and in keeping with best practices for the treatment of the emerging disease. It must be noted that healthcare organizations in such circumstances may not be able to modify the technology that supports patient care at the same pace or at all to integrate new information as it emerges. This inability to modify the technology or the lag time associated with technology change may lead health professionals to make decisions that are not consistent with current, patient-centric best practices involving the emerging disease. Inconsistencies between emerging patient centric treatments and the HIT could lead to the introduction of errors -technology-induced errors, where the technology is inconsistent with best practice [31] .",

There is a need to fully assess and understand the disease in the context of health system and HIT infrastructure of a country as suggested by Sittig and colleagues [58] . Developed and developing countries have differing needs. For example, the presence or absence of electricity, mobile phone coverage and the Internet influence what type of hardware is selected for clinical documentation. If there is limited electricity then some types of devices may be effective to use such as those that have long battery life (e.g. mobile phones and cameras to take pictures of paper documents versus laptop or desktop computers). Software (i.e. EHRs and DSS) need to be considered. Here, developed and developing countries employ these technologies in disease outbreak contexts. Many proprietary EHRs can be modified and DSS created to support clinician work as we have outlined earlier in this paper. In contrast many of the EHRs (including DSS) that are used in the developing world are open source. Morrison and colleagues [59] identify that many of the open source EHRs lack the essential characteristics of a HIT that can fully support management of new/emerging diseases such as the ability to quickly embed treatment and research protocols, create reminders and measure response to treatment of disease. Buhler et. al. [60] note healthcare workers, who are in the midst of caring for patients with such diseases, are more concerned about patients who are suffering from illness, having sufficient people to care for patients and their families, and having access to protective clothing to prevent further spread of the disease. They note that laptops, mobile phones and cameras (used to photograph the paper chart) are a concern for healthcare professionals. The belief is that HIT may become contaminated and that current approaches to decontaminating the technology may damage the HIT itself [59] .
