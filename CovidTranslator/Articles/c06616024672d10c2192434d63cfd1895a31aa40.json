To identify the correct ones, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for the amino or the carboxy terminus of E protein, respectively, were generated. E protein was mainly found in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) of cells transfected with a plasmid encoding E protein or infected with SARS-CoV. No evidence of E protein presence in the plasma membrane was found by using immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy and cell surface protein labeling. In addition, measurement of plasma membrane voltage gated ion channel activity by whole-cell patch clamp suggested that E protein was not present in the plasma membrane. A topological conformation in which SARS-CoV E protein amino terminus is oriented towards the lumen of intracellular membranes and carboxy terminus faces cell cytoplasm is proposed.",

Several proteins are embedded within the SARS-CoV envelope: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and the group specific proteins 3a, 6, 7a and 7b (Huang et al., 2006 (Huang et al., , 2007 Schaecher et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2005) . Protected by the viral envelope, there is a helicoidal nucleocapsid, formed by the association of the nucleoprotein (N) and the viral genome (gRNA). The CoV infectious cycle begins when the S protein binds the cellular receptor, which in the case of SARS-CoV is the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2) (Li et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2004) , and the virus enters into the cell. Then, the virus nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm, and ORFs 1a and 1b are translated directly from the gRNA, generating two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed by viral proteinases yielding the replication-transcription complex proteins (Ziebuhr, 2005; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . This complex associates with double membrane vesicles (Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006) and is involved in viral genome replication and in the synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs) through negative polarity intermediaries in both cases Masters, 2006; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; van der Most and Spaan, 1995; Zu\u00f1iga et al., 2010) . CoV proteins M, S and E are synthesized and incorporated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and transported to the pre-Golgi compartment where M protein recruits S protein and binds E protein (de Haan et al., 1999; Lim and Liu, 2001; Nguyen and Hogue, 1997) . In parallel, N protein binds gRNA to Virology 415 (2011) 69-82 generate the nucleocapsid that is incorporated into virions through the interaction of N and M proteins during an intracellular budding process (Narayanan et al., 2000) . Assembled virions accumulate in vesicles that progress through the secretory pathway, and fuse with the plasma membrane to release viruses into the extracellular media (Tooze et al., 1987) .",

            "text": "CoV E protein is a small integral membrane protein whose sequence varies between 76 and 109 amino acids (Arbely et al., 2004; Raamsman et al., 2000) . Based on primary and secondary structure, the E protein can be divided into a short hydrophilic amino terminal stretch of between 7 and 12 amino acids, a hydrophobic zone of around 25 amino acids with an \u03b1-helix secondary structure that constitutes the transmembrane region of the protein, and a carboxy terminal domain, that comprises the majority of the protein (Torres et al., 2007) . Nevertheless, a variety of E protein topologies have been described for different CoVs. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E proteins expose their carboxy terminal region towards the cell cytoplasm, whereas the amino terminal domain is located towards the luminal side of intracellular membranes for IBV or towards the cytoplasm for MHV (Corse and Machamer, 2000; Raamsman et al., 2000) . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) E protein adopts a carboxy terminus luminal, amino terminus cytosolic conformation (Godet et al., 1992) . In the case of SARS-CoV two alternative topologies have been proposed. In one of them, the transmembrane region forms a helical hairpin, with the amino and carboxy termini oriented towards the cytoplasm (Arbely et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2006) . In the other one, E protein establishes a single-pass transmembrane conformation with the carboxy terminal domain oriented towards the luminal side and the amino terminal domain remaining oriented towards the cytoplasm . Therefore, the precise intracellular topology of SARS-CoV E protein is still under debate and needs to be clarified.",

Nevertheless, the relevance of the SARS-CoV E protein ion channel activity and its possible relationship with virus trafficking and assembly is not known. In vitro studies using artificial lipid bilayers showed that HCoV-229E, MHV, SARS-CoV and IBV E proteins behaved as cation-selective ion channels (Torres et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2006 Wilson et al., , 2004 . A recent report determined that SARS-CoV E protein expressed in mammalian cells, displayed ion channel activity at the plasma membrane as determined by whole-cell patch clamp (Pervushin et al., 2009 ).

No evidence of E protein presence in the plasma membrane was found using immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy or cell surface protein labeling and purification. In addition, whole-cell patch clamp assays revealed decreased current intensity in the plasma membrane of cells expressing E protein, which is not compatible with an E protein mediated voltage gated ion channel at the cell surface. All these data indicated that the E protein would carry out its direct functions from intracellular membranes. By using the specific antibodies generated in this work and selective permeabilization of plasma or intracellular membranes, we propose a topological conformation for SARS-CoV E protein in which this protein spans intracellular membranes only once, with the E protein amino terminus oriented towards the lumen of intracellular membranes and the E protein carboxy terminus exposed towards the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "To determine the cellular localization and topology of SARS-CoV E protein, five independently derived hybridomas producing mAbs specific for SARS-CoV E protein were generated. SARS-CoV E protein is mainly hydrophobic and poorly immunogenic (Fig. 1A) . Nevertheless, in silico analysis of the E protein amino acid sequence revealed the presence of two regions located in the amino (ENT) and carboxy terminus (ECT) of the protein with higher probability of inducing an immune response (Fig. 1A) . To obtain mAbs recognizing different regions of the protein, three pairs of BALB/c mice were each immunized with affinity chromatography purified full-length SARS-CoV E protein expressed in bacteria, or in a baculovirus system, or with chemically synthesized E protein. Sera from immunized mice were analyzed by ELISA using the three sources of purified E protein, and by immunofluorescence using rSARS-CoV wt-infected Vero E6 cells and cells infected with a recombinant virus lacking E gene (rSARS-CoV-\u0394E) as a negative control. ELISA and immunofluorescence assays showed that the sera from all immunized animals contained antibodies specific for SARS-CoV E protein (data not shown). However, three of the six mice (one of each pair), which developed the highest titers to E protein died or became sick prior to hybridoma generation. The remaining seropositive mice were boosted with the same antigen used in previous immunizations, and sacrificed to collect their spleens to generate hybridomas. Five hybridomas that produced mAbs positive by ELISA, immunofluorescence and Western blot assays were selected and mAbs were purified by G protein affinity chromatography. All the selected hybridomas were derived from a mouse immunized with the SARS-CoV E protein produced in bacteria. The corresponding purified mAbs (E1, E2, E3, E4 and E5) specifically recognized E protein by immunofluorescence assays on Vero E6 cells infected with rSARS-CoV wt but did not bind to the control rSARS-CoV-\u0394E infected cells (Fig. 1B) . The mAbs showed a staining pattern consistent with a perinuclear distribution of E protein, similar to that observed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for E protein (pAb \u03b1 E) used as a positive control. Nevertheless, some differences in the staining could be observed. mAb E5 showed the strongest signal and the lowest background in the immunostaining (Fig. 1B) . Western blot analysis using protein extracts of rSARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells showed that all mAbs and the rabbit pAb specific for E protein The highest antigenic regions of the protein are shown in gray boxes. (B) Immunofluorescences of SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Vero E6 cells were grown on coverslips and infected at an moi of 0.3 with rSARS-CoV wt (wt) or with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E (\u0394E) as a control. At 24 hpi cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and labeled with E protein specific antibodies (green). Rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for E protein (pAb \u03b1 E) was used as a control. mAbs are numbered from E1 to E5. (C) Western blot analysis of SARS-CoVinfected Vero E6 cells. Vero E6 cells were infected at an moi of 0.3 with rSARS-CoV wt (wt) or with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E (\u0394E) as a control. At 24 hpi cell lysates were collected and probed with mAbs specific for E protein (E1 to E5) or with a polyclonal antibody used as a control (pAb \u03b1 E). mAbs isotype is indicated bellow Western blot results (C). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) recognized a band of approximately 14 kDa, corresponding to E protein. mAb E4 showed the strongest binding by Western blot (Fig. 1C) . To analyze the immunoglobulin subclass of each antibody, mAbs were subjected to an ELISA using specific secondary antibodies recognizing the heavy chain of mouse immunoglobulins (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3 and IgM). Three of the selected mAbs matched to IgG2a isotype and two to IgG2b isotype (Fig. 1C) .",

Special focus was devoted to the potential presence of E protein in the plasma membrane, a place where it might display ion channel activity, a remarkable function of this protein. To this end, Vero E6 cells were either infected with rSARS-CoV wt or with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E as a control, or transfected with the pcDNA-E plasmid or the empty plasmid as a control. Cells were fixed at different hours post infection (hpi) or transfection (hpt), permeabilized, and the subcellular localization of E protein was determined by immunofluorescence, using the E protein specific antibodies previously described and antibodies for the cellular proteins PDI (ER marker), ERGIC53 (ERGIC marker) and cadherin (plasma membrane marker). Confocal microscopy analysis showed similar patterns of E protein distribution in transfected and infected cells at different time points (Fig. 3) , suggesting that none of the other viral proteins significantly influenced the subcellular localization of SARS-CoV E protein. At 8 and 16 hpt or hpi E protein mainly colocalized with the ERGIC marker, whereas essentially no colocalization was observed with the ER (in some infected cells a reduced number of colocalization points could be seen), and no colocalization with plasma membrane marker was detected ( Fig. 3 and data not shown). Between 24 and 48 hpt or hpi, when the cytopathic effect became evident in infected cells, E protein showed a broader staining pattern in part of the cells (30-40%), which partially overlapped with ERGIC marker, whereas no colocalization was observed with the ER, or with the plasma membrane ( Fig. 3 and data not shown). These data showed that SARS-CoV E protein was mainly accumulated within the ERGIC and was not detected at the plasma membrane. To further analyze whether SARS-CoV E protein is present at the plasma membrane, immunofluorescence studies were also performed using non-permeabilized transfected and infected cells, in order to better preserve plasma membrane structure, and antibodies specific for E protein amino and carboxy terminal domains. No specific labeling was detected at the plasma membrane level, reinforcing the previous observations (see below, in SARS-CoV E protein topology section).",

This technique would determine any potential increase in ion currents due to the presence of minor quantities of E protein derived ion channels at the plasma membrane. HEK-293T cells were mock transfected, transfected with an empty plasmid or with a plasmid expressing SARS-CoV E protein (pcDNA-E). At 24 hpt cells were analyzed by the patch-clamp technique in a whole-cell configuration, which allow to measure voltage activated currents corresponding to voltage gated ion channels distributed all over the plasma membrane. Interestingly, control cells without E protein showed high intensity voltage activated currents, whereas cells expressing E protein revealed a significant decrease in current intensities (Fig. 6) . These data suggested that E protein was not acting as a voltage gated ion channel present at the plasma membrane, because, that being the case, an increase in voltage activated currents intensity should have been observed in cells expressing E protein as compared with control cells. This finding reinforces our previous conclusion on the absence of E protein within the cell plasma membrane. The observed decrease in current intensity could be due to an indirect effect of E protein on plasma membrane proteins involved in ion transport. In fact we performed E protein pull down assays (Fig. 7) , and demonstrated the interaction of SARS-CoV E protein with Na + /K + ATPase alpha 1 subunit and stomatin, that were identified by mass spectrometry with significant Mascot scores (301/ 80 and 251/70 respectively). Na + /K + ATPase is the main cellular ion pump involved in ion homeostasis control (Kaplan, 2002 ) and stomatin has been described as an ion channel regulator (Price et al., 2004) .

Nuclei were stained with DAPI in all cases (blue). of SARS-CoV E protein within cell membranes, antibodies specific for the ENT or ECT domains were used in immunofluorescence assays on detergent permeabilized cells. Vero E6 cells transfected with plasmids expressing E protein or infected with SARS-CoV wt were processed either without permeabilization, after permeabilizing their plasma membrane by using digitonin, or after permeabilizing plasma and intracellular membranes by using Triton X-100. An antibody recognizing the cytoplasmic protein \u03b2-tubulin, and another one specific for the luminal endoplasmic reticulum protein PDI were used as controls of permeabilization of the plasma membrane or intracellular membranes. The selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane by using digitonin led to the detection of SARS-CoV ECT domain in cells transfected with a plasmid encoding E protein and in SARS-CoV wtinfected cells (Fig. 8) . Under these conditions, the cytosolic protein \u03b2tubulin was also detected, in contrast to the luminal ER protein PDI that was not accessible, as expected (Fig. 8) . Permeabilization of plasma and intracellular membranes with Triton X-100 allowed the detection of SARS-CoV ECT domain, \u03b2-tubulin and PDI, as expected (Fig. 8) . These experiments were repeated several times with identical results indicating that SARS-CoV ECT domain was exposed towards the cell cytoplasm. In contrast, SARS-CoV ENT domain was only detected when transfected or infected cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100, indicating that this domain must only be exposed towards the luminal side (Fig. 8) . Overall, these data indicated that SARS-CoV E protein has a topological conformation spanning the intracellular membranes only once exposing its carboxy terminal domain towards the cell cytoplasm and the amino terminal domain towards the lumen of intracellular membranes.",

Nevertheless, neither our results shown in this manuscript nor other published work (Nal et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2006) have provided direct evidence showing the presence of SARS-CoV E protein in the plasma membrane. In fact, special attention was paid in this study to analyze whether SARS-CoV E protein was located in the plasma membrane. Immunofluorescence analysis of cells transfected with a plasmid encoding E protein and SARS-CoV-infected cells, revealed that E protein did not accumulate at the plasma membrane neither at early (8 and 16 hpt or hpi) nor at late time points (24 and 48 hpt or hpi). In addition, immunofluorescence using non-permeabilized cells and antibodies specific for the amino or carboxy terminal domains of E protein did not reveal any specific staining at the cell surface. To reinforce these data immunoelectron microscopy was performed. E protein was identified intracellularly in infected cells, close to viral factories, whereas no significant labeling was observed at the plasma membrane. To further study the possible presence of E protein in the plasma membrane, cell surface proteins were biotinylated and isolated. Protein biotinylation was achieved by using a compound that binds covalently to primary amines, present in lysines side chain and in the protein N-terminal amino acid. If SARS-CoV E protein would be displayed in the plasma membrane, it should expose its amino terminal domain towards the outside of the cell, taking into account our purposed topological conformation. No lysine residues are contained within SARS-CoV E protein amino terminal domain. Nevertheless, the amino group of the N-terminal amino acid would be a potential site of biotinylation. No evidence of biotinylated E protein was detected, indicating that E protein did not accumulate in the plasma membrane.",

If E protein were acting as an ion channel activated by voltage in the plasma membrane, an increase in current intensities displayed by cells expressing E protein, as compared with control cells, would be expected. Interestingly, cells expressing E protein showed a decrease of current intensities as compared with control cells not expressing E protein, suggesting that this protein was not acting as an ion channel at the plasma membrane, and reinforcing the observation that E protein was not physically located within the plasma membrane. The fact that E protein decreased ion currents in the plasma membrane might be explained by an indirect influence of E protein on other cellular proteins involved in ion transport. Recently, in our laboratory, two cellular proteins involved in ion transport: Na + /K + ATPase alpha 1 subunit and stomatin, have been identified as interacting partners of SARS-CoV E protein. Possibly, these interactions could lead to partial relocalization of these proteins and therefore to the observed reduction of ion transport, which may explain decreased voltage activated currents intensity detected by whole-cell patch clamp assays. Importantly, in agreement with our work, it has been shown that E protein does not display ion channel activity in a different experimental system, the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes (Ji et al., 2009 ) but decreases the levels and activity of human epithelial sodium channels, affecting ion transport at the plasma membrane level.",

Mice were immunized with three doses of 100, 50 and 50 \u03bcg of one source of protein at days 0, 21 and 35, respectively. Antigen was delivered intraperitoneally with complete Freund's adjuvant in the first immunization and with incomplete Freund's adjuvant in the following ones. Ten days after the last immunization, sera were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified E protein from the three origins and by immunofluorescence using rSARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Mice that developed an antibody response to SARS-CoV E protein were selected and boosted with two consecutive doses of 40 \u03bcg of antigen. Three days later, animals were sacrificed, and spleens were collected and dissociated. Cell fusion with the murine myeloma cell line X63-Ag8.653 (Kearney et al., 1979) using the polyethylene glycol method was performed (Galfre and Milstein, 1981) and hybridomas were generated. Hybridomas were cultured in 96 multiwell plates using ClonaCell\u00ae-HY medium E (StemCell Technologies) supplemented with 10 \u03bcM azaserine. Ten days after seeding, culture supernatants were analyzed by ELISA, using the three sources of purified SARS-CoV E protein, and by immunofluorescence and Western blot, using SARS-CoV-infected cells. Hybridomas secreting specific antibodies were selected and cloned twice by limit dilution. Supernatants were analyzed 10-14 days after seeding as described above. mAbs purification from hybridoma culture supernatant was achieved by G protein affinity chromatography in HiTrap\u2122 Protein G HP columns (GE Healthcare), and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
