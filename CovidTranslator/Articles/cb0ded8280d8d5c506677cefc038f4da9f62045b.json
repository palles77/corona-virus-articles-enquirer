            "text": "Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The disease presents in both tropical and temperate zones. The major reservoirs of the organisms are cattle, horses, canines and rodents. Humans are accidentally infected through contact with contaminated water. The symptoms range from mild or asymptomatic to severe fatal illness. The severe illness, characterized by febrile illness with jaundice, acute renal injury and bleeding, is recognized as Weil's disease, though many different local names have been used such as Fort Bragg, mud, swamp and sugar cane fevers. Specific treatment with antibiotics is valuable at all stages of the illness and prevents development of severe disease. In severely ill patients, intensive care supportive treatment is crucial.",

Leptospira are spiral bacteria (spirochaete) in the family of Leptospiraceae. There are eight pathogenic, seven non-pathogenic Leptospira species, and five intermediate species with unknown ability for causing disease. Leptospira interrogans and L. borgpetersenii are the two most common species causing diseases in human and animals. The schematic classification of the organisms is shown in Figure 37 .1.",

L. interrogans has 35-41% GC content in two circular chromosomes of approximately 4 Mb and 300 Kb in size. L. borgpetersenii has a smaller genome (3.9 Mb) and a larger proportion of pseudogenes (20%), compared with L. interrogans. This may impair the ability of L. borgpetersenii to survive in the external environment, and so require direct contact between hosts to maintain the transmission cycle. 3, 4 Recent developments in molecular typing have characterized relationships between pathogenic strains and assisted outbreak investigation and epidemiology. Several typing techniques have been developed. One is the sequence-based approach, multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Using MLST the major outbreak of leptospirosis in Thailand during 1996-2000 was shown to have been caused by one successive clone, strain type (ST) 34 of L. interrogans serovar Autumnalis. (MLST has been used to create a standard global database for typing and mapping strains of Leptospira, see: http://leptospira.mlst.net). 5",

            "text": "After skin or mucosal penetration, the organisms cross the tissue barriers through intercellular junctions. Leptospires can be detected in the bloodstream shortly after penetration into the body, and from some organs within three days after infection. Leptospires are rarely observed within host cells. However, they can reside transiently within cells while crossing cell barriers. The organisms can evade host immune response during the initial phase of infection through unclear mechanisms. They are resistant to the alternative pathway of complement activation and acquire complement factor H and related fluid-phase regulators through ligands such as leptospiral endostatin-like A (LenA) proteins. 12 Recent data show that pathogenic leptospires can bind human plasminogen (PLG), and plasmin activity on the bacterial surface interferes with complement C3b and IgG deposition, therefore decreasing opsonization of the organisms. 13 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of pathogenic leptospires can activate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) but not TLR4 pathway, and activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines mediating inflammation and damaging end-organ tissues. 14 Comparison of putative pathogenicity factors with the saprophyte, L. biflexa has identified several pathogenic processes. These can be divided into three components; adhesins (proteoglycans, LenA, 36 kDa outer surface membrane protein, 24 and 21 kDa laminin binding protein (Lsa24, Lsa21), Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like proteins (Lig A, Lig B and Lig C proteins); evasion of natural defences or phagocytosis; and resistance to complement as described above. Unlike other Gram-negative bacteria, the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of leptospires cause minor endotoxicity, while leptospiral outer membrane lipoproteins (OMPs), such as Lip32, Loa22 play a major role as virulence factors. 15 Although the early phase of the disease does not cause much inflammation, hepatocellular and tubular damage can occur. Liver pathology ranges from no appreciable changes, unicellular damage with oedema, to spotty necrosis surrounded by mononuclear cells without hepatocyte ballooning or swelling. Complete liver cell necrosis is not unusual. Kupffer cells and sinusoidal lining cells may show swollen cytoplasm. Biliary stasis with bile droplets in hepatocytes and bile thrombi in the canaliculi is prominent in the centrolobular areas, with infection. The organisms are usually transferred from animal to animal by direct contact. The maintenance hosts or carriers can excrete Leptospira in their urine for long periods of time or for their entire lives. Leptospires survive weeks or months in moist and warm soil, stagnant water at neutral or slightly alkaline pH. Humans are infected via direct contact with infected animal urine, animal abortion products or most commonly through indirect contact with infected urine-contaminated water. The oral route of transmission had been reported in water-borne fatal outbreaks in Portugal, Greece, Russia, Italy and India,. 2, 6, 7 Breast milk transmission may occur. 8 Sexual and vertical transmission in humans occurs rarely.",

The six highest incidences reported are from the Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea islands (Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, Costa Rica and Sri Lanka). Countries in South-east Asia, except Thailand and Singapore, have no official incidence data, so the true incidence is unknown. 9 The Leptospirosis Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (LERG) set up by World Health Organization (WHO) is trying 16 Renal pathology is mainly tubulointerstitial nephritis. In severe cases, tubular necrosis and medullary tubular cell desquamation can occur. Glomeruli contain exudates and inflammatory cell infiltration, but are usually spared. 17 Primary injury of the proximal convoluted tubules is regarded as the hallmark of renal pathology, especially affecting sodium and water transportation. 18 Recently developed in situ hybridization assays and immunohistochemistry suggest that cell membrane damage in both the liver and kidney may be important in pathogenesis. 19 Vasculitis is a prominent feature of leptospirosis. Endothelial damage and increased capillary fragility lead to internal organ haemorrhage. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is not obvious in the pathology in fatal cases. However, with new definitions and sensitive markers for detection of DIC, patients with leptospirosis do have significantly elevated fibrinogen, D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin III complexes, and prothrombin fragment 1,2. Using DIC scores, defined by the DIC scientific subcommittee of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, overt DIC was evident in nearly half of patients. 20 Fatal bleeding usually occurs in the lung, with fibrin aggregation suggestive of adult respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS) in nearly 60% of fatal cases.
