Shortly afterwards, it was rapidly spread to North America and Europe. Threatened by such a disease, scientists in all areas are devoted to the research for finding the treatment of SARS. Cumulative evidences indicate that a previously unrecognized coronavirus is the culprit of SARS [4, 7, 10] . It is also known that the process of cleaving the SARS-CoV polyproteins by a special proteinase, the so-called SARS coronavirus main proteinase (SARS-CoV M pro , 3CL pro ), is a key step for the replication of SARS-CoV. The functional importance of the M pro in the viral life cycle makes it an attractive target for developing drugs directly against this new disease.",

            "text": "According to the''lock-and-key''mechanism in enzymology, an octapeptide cleavable by the SARS proteinase must have a good fit for binding to its active site [8] . Thus, the cleavable peptide, after some chemical modification, can be converted to a competent inhibitor against the enzyme, as elaborated by Chou [6] in the ''distorted key'' theory. In view of this, the knowledge about what kind of peptide sequences can be cleaved by 3CL pro is important in designing effective inhibitors against 3CL pro and potential drugs for SARS therapy [17] . The protease-susceptible sites in proteins usually extend to an octapeptide [5, 8, 15, 16] , as generally formulated by P \u00c04 P \u00c03 P \u00c02 P \u00c01 # P 1 P 2 P 3 P 4 with the scissile bond located between the subsites P \u00c01 and P 1 [6] . The SARS coronavirus enzyme and several viral proteinases exhibit Gln # (Ser, Ala, and Gly) specificity [4, 10] . The octapeptide AVLQSGFR selected in this paper was taken from the paper by Chou et al. [10] . These authors had done studies of docking the octapeptide to SARS-CoV M pro based on the three-dimensional structure of SARS coronavirus main proteinase obtained by Anand et al. [4] through a homologous approach. The binding results obtained through docking study [10] and structural bioinformatics [7] show that the octapeptide AVLQSGFR is bound to the SARS proteinase through six hydrogen bonds. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV M pro has also been determined later by Yang et al. [18] , whose results have confirmed the above analysis. The present study was initiated in an attempt to conduct an in-depth examination of the antiviral activity of the octapeptide AVLQSGFR against SARS-associated coronavirus by biochemical experimental approaches.",

            "text": "The molecular mechanism of the octapeptide inhibiting the activity of SARS-CoV may be illuminated by the binding mechanism of the enzyme SARS-CoV M pro with its ligands. It has been pointed by Chou et al. [10] that there are six hydrogen bonds formed between the octapeptide AVLQSGFR and the SARS-CoV M pro . Those residues involved in forming the hydrogen bonds from the enzyme are: Arg-40, His-41, Phe-185, Asp-187, and Gln-189. The interaction is so strong that the octapeptide naturally becomes an ideal competitive inhibitor for the SARS proteinase [1] [2] [3] 9] . Accordingly, our results obtained through biochemical experiments are fully in consistent with those of the computational docking studies performed by Chou et al. [10, [12] [13] [14] 17] . Furthermore, our results are also compatible with those of Cinatl et al. [11] , who assessed the antiviral potential of ribavirin, 6-azauridine, pyrazofurin, mycophenolic acid, and glycyrrhizin against two SARS coronavirus strains (FFM-1 and FFM-2) isolated from Germany patients. The EC 50 for AVLQSGFR we recorded shows the lowest concentration among those existing compounds and a higher selective antiviral activity (SI > 3704) against SARS-CoV. This suggests that AVLQSGFR can serve as a starting entity in the course of discovering effective drug candidates for the treatment of SARS. ",

Stimulated by the binding mechanism of SARS-CoV M pro with the octapeptide AVLQSGFR reported recently as well as the ''Chou's distorted key'' theory, we synthesized the octapeptide AVLQSGFR for conducting various biochemical experiments to investigate the antiviral potential of the octapeptide against SARS coronavirus (BJ-01). The results demonstrate that, compared with other compounds reported so far, AVLQSGFR is the most active in inhibiting replication of the SARS coronavirus, and that no detectable toxicity is observed on Vero cells under the condition of experimental concentration. # 2005 Elsevier Inc.
