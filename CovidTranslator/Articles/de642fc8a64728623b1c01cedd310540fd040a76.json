Combating the threat of an impending H5N1 influenza pandemic will require a combination of pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies. The emergence of the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 emphasised the unpredictable nature of a pandemic influenza. Undoubtedly, vaccines offer the most viable means to combat a pandemic threat. Current egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing strategies are unlikely to be able to cater to the huge, rapid global demand because of the anticipated scarcity of embryonated eggs in an avian influenza pandemic and other factors associated with the vaccine production process. Therefore, alternative, egg-independent vaccine manufacturing strategies should be evaluated to supplement the traditional egg-derived influenza vaccine manufacturing. Furthermore, evaluation of dose-sparing strategies that offer protection with a reduced antigen dose will be critical for pandemic influenza preparedness. Development of new antiviral therapeutics and other, nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies will further supplement pandemic preparedness. This review highlights the current status of eggdependent and egg-independent strategies against an avian influenza pandemic.",

Pandemics and 1968 (Hong Kong Flu) -collectively arise when a novel influenza strain emerges that accounted for millions of deaths worldwide can infect and spread efficiently in immunologically naive human populations. Changes in the influenza viral genome can occur in one of two ways: (1) the accumulation of genetic mutations (antigenic drift), due to host selective pressure and/or a faulty viral RNA polymerase activity; and (2) the exchange of one or more fragments of its segmented genome (genetic reassortment) with other influenza viruses coinfecting the same cell, leading to the expression of novel surface antigen(s) (antigenic shift). The genetic novelty of the 1957 Asian and 1968 Hong Kong pandemic influenza virusesclassified as H2N2 and H3N2, respectively, according to the subtypes of the surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) they express -were the result of genetic reassortment between human and avian influenza viruses, probably due to coinfection in pigs (Refs 2,3,4,5) (Fig. 1) . Recent evidence suggested that the genetic novelty of the 1918 Spanish pandemic influenza virus (H1N1) was possibly due to direct transmission of an avian influenza virus to humans, although the absolute origin of this virus remains unknown (Ref. 6); another study indicated that probably all three pandemic influenza strains of the 20th century may have been generated through a series of multiple reassortment events (Ref. 7) . The recent 2009 Mexican (or H1N1) Flu pandemic was also caused by reassortment (of avian, pig and human viruses), to produce a novel H1N1 virus that was able to spread rapidly worldwide, but with limited pathogenicity (Ref. 8 ).",

            "text": "Prior to the 2009 Mexican Flu pandemic, the outbreaks over the past ten years of human influenza caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus caused serious concern because of its high lethality (Fig. 1 ), although the virus does not currently show efficient human-human transmission and is considered 'prepandemic'. The 1997 outbreak of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong was the result of direct transmission of an entirely avian influenza virus to humans (Refs 9 , 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) , and resulted in 18 documented cases of respiratory disease including six deaths ( Refs 2, 15) . The amino acid changes in the polymerase proteins, specifically PB2, identified in the 1918 virus are also seen in the 1997 H5N1 viruses (Ref. 6) . In 2003, H5N1 viruses were again isolated from two human cases in Hong Kong, one of which was fatal (Ref. 16) . Since then, human infections with H5N1 viruses have spread to several countries in Asia, Europe and Africa (Ref. 17) , accounting for 471 cases, with a 60% case fatality (Fig. 1) . H5N1 virus transmission within migratory and aquatic birds and its backand-forth transmission to poultry populations and further spread to humans due to close contacts with the diseased birds are well documented. Furthermore, the H5N1 virus causes significant infections in dogs, tigers, cats, stone martens and perhaps other mammals, indicating that it has an expanded host range (Ref. 18 ). In addition to influenza in humans caused by H5N1, respiratory infection in humans with other avian influenza subtypes (H9N2 and H7N7) have been documented in Hong Kong, southern China, and the Netherlands ( Refs 19, 20, 21, 22) .",

The emergence of H1N1 Mexican Flu in early 2009 and the declaration of the H1N1 pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) as early as June 2009 provided enough time for large-scale strain-matched egg-based vaccine preparation before the onset of the regular influenza season in the northern hemisphere.

These drugs fall broadly into two categories: blockers of the influenza matrix protein 2 (M2) ion channel (the adamantane derivatives such as amantadine and rimantadine); and (2) neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir). Antivirals offer an important intervention strategy for pandemic preparedness as they can be stockpiled and have a longer shelf life than vaccines while not requiring refrigeration. However, there have been increasing reports of drug resistance of HPAI H5N1 viruses ( Refs 30, 31, 32) and seasonal influenza viruses ( Refs 33, 34, 35) . The majority of H5N1 viruses isolated from Vietnam and Thailand are resistant to adamantanes (Ref. 30 ) and, recently, resistance of H5N1 virus to oseltamivir has also been reported ( Refs 31, 32, 36, 37) .

As per the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CHMP) (Ref. 70) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines (Ref. 71) , the endpoints of HI for the pandemic influenza vaccine licensure are: the percentage of participants with a reciprocal titre of \u226540 defined as seropositivity (the seroprotective threshold for seasonal influenza); and the proportion of participants who seroconverted (percentage of people vaccinated having a reciprocal titre of <10 before vaccination and a titre of >40 after vaccination) or showed a significant increase in antibody titre (percentage of people vaccinated having a reciprocal titre of >10 before vaccination and at least a fourfold increase in titre after vaccination). However, there are several concerns regarding the use of an endpoint HI titre of 1:40 for evaluation of protection efficacy against pandemic influenza. Questions remain about whether this titre can be used universally for all influenza strains, can reflect protection in a naive population, or can still indicate protection if there are changes in the assay procedure to enhance sensitivity to new virus strains (Ref. 72).",

Several strategies that are currently being evaluated in the search for an ideal pandemic influenza vaccine are depicted in Figure 2 . It is almost impossible to predict the characteristics of the next influenza pandemic strain, and so a prepandemic vaccine able to induce some degree of crossprotective haemagglutinin-specific humoral response and a conserved-nucleoprotein-specific cellular immune response would likely provide reasonable protection before a haemagglutinin-subtype specific vaccine becomes available.",

However, in the context of a pandemic, an egg-derived vaccine has several limitations (Ref. 47) . Following the procurement of certified eggs, the entire process of vaccine manufacture takes approximately five to six months from the determination of vaccine strains to vaccine release (Ref. 47) . Moreover, difficulties in adapting the virus strain for efficient replication in eggs, while retaining the antigenic and genetic fidelity, are often encountered in seasonal influenza vaccine production. The potential susceptibility of chickens to HPAI viruses further jeopardises the availability of eggs for vaccine production in the event of a pandemic strain arising from an HPAI virus. Nonetheless, the yields from A/Puerto Rico/8/ 1934 reassortants, which provide the seeds of the majority of inactivated influenza A vaccines, are higher in eggs than in continuous cell lines (Ref. 48) , and recent improvements in production yields and dose-sparing have led to the enhancement of the current egg-based vaccine manufacturing capacity by threefold over the past few years (Ref. 49 ).",

Tosh Unfortunately, the success of the seasonal trivalent LAIV has not been replicated in the pandemic vaccine candidate H5N1 LAIVs. To meet the requirement of the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CHMP) for immunogenicity, for adults the seroprotection rate must exceed 70% and the seroconversion rate must be at least 40% (for elderly subjects, the respective limits are 60% and 30%) (Box 1). In a clinical trial, only 11% of the study subjects aged 18 Whole-virus inactivated vaccines-Historically, whole-virus inactivated vaccines have been generated using genetic reassortment similar to that described for LAIV, with the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes derived from the relevant circulating strain, but with the major difference being that the internal genes are from the high-yield master donor strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934. Subsequently, the reassortant virus is subjected to standard formalin inactivation (Ref. 73) . Split preparations (chemically disrupted influenza virus) or subunit preparations (antigenic proteins purified after chemical solubilisation of influenza virus) of inactivated vaccines have been preferred over whole-virus inactivated vaccines because of reactogenicity, especially in children ( Refs 74, 75, 76) . Nonetheless, an inactivated egg-derived H9N2 whole-virus vaccine was shown to be more immunogenic (producing better responses) in a naive population with a single dose than its subunit counterpart (Ref. 77) . Furthermore, use of whole-virus vaccines may also avoid the antigen losses during the disruption process of an inactivated split-virion vaccine (Ref. 73 ).",

            "text": "Owing to the inherent low immunogenicity of H5 haemagglutinin in humans, novel adjuvanted formulations of inactivated whole-virus vaccine will not only enhance the immunogenicity but also lead to dose-sparing. However, a potential safety concern regarding the use of an adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine became apparent when an intranasal vaccine formulation introduced in Switzerland was strongly associated with Bell palsy (Ref. 81) , suggesting the need for a large-scale safety trial for the licensure and commercial release of a new vaccine formulation. In a sequel to this study, a third dose of the vaccine, administered six months after the second dose, resulted in protective antibody titres in 78% and 67% of the subjects who initially received 90 or 45 mg doses, respectively. The neutralising antibody levels remained significantly higher even five months after the third dose, compared with that observed after the second dose (Ref. 84) . It should be noted, however, that increasing the amount of antigen and the number of doses is not a viable strategy for pandemic preparedness both in terms of time and economics, and therefore dose-sparing using novel adjuvant strategies will be required ( Refs 85, 86, 87, 88, 89) . There was a significant reduction in seroconversion after six months in both the adults and elderly. However, the group that received a third booster dose (7.5 or 15 mg) showed seroprotection of 90% and 84% or better in the adult and elderly groups, respectively. This vaccine formulation also generated crossneutralising antibodies to a clade 2 H5N1 virus, suggesting that it can be used in a prepandemic scenario and, more importantly, for all age groups (Ref. The concept of proactive prepandemic priming that may induce long-lasting immune memory and allow a single booster vaccine to induce protection has gained momentum as a potential strategy for pandemic preparedness (Ref. 100 ). Two 7.5 mg booster doses of an inactivated MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/ 2004 NIBRG-M vaccine were administered in subjects who had previously (at least six years earlier) been primed with two doses of either MF59adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted A/duck/ Singapore/1997 (H5N3) vaccine containing 7.5-30 mg of haemagglutinin. These booster doses induced a significantly better vaccine response in subjects primed with MF59-adjuvanted vaccine in terms of early induction and persistence of crossreacting antibody responses for six months than in unprimed subjects or in those primed with an unadjuvanted vaccine. Seven days after administration of the booster, 90% of MF59primed subjects exhibited high titres of neutralising antibodies towards diverse H5N1 viruses, as well as to the original H5 priming strains, suggesting H5 priming with MF59-adjuvanted vaccine may result in dose-sparing by limiting the amount and number of doses required to achieve seroprotective titres from a distinct H5 strain. This might be due to the induction of an immune memory B cell pool that probably expands more rapidly and efficiently with booster immunisation (Refs 101,102) . These recent findings have highlighted the importance of novel adjuvant formulations and prime-boost strategies in influenza pandemic preparedness.",

Major vaccine manufacturers are at various stages of developing cell-derived vaccines for seasonal and pandemic influenza (Refs 103,104), and a cell-derived seasonal influenza vaccine is already on the market in Europe (Ref. 105) . Cell-derived vaccines assume much significance with respect to pandemic preparedness since their production is not exposed to anticipated vulnerabilities in the supply of embryonated eggs in a prepandemic/ pandemic scenario. Additionally, cell-based vaccine manufacturing in closed scalable bioreactors reduces the risk of exogenous contamination. Following the identification of the pandemic strain, it has a shorter lead manufacturing time of one to three months compared with approximately five to six months for the egg-based approach (Ref. 106). The cell-based production of influenza vaccines minimises the selection of any virus variants with reduced immunogenicity and altered antigenicity, which might sometimes result during the adaptation of virus strains to eggs in an egg-based vaccine manufacturing process (Refs 107,108,109). However, some of the limitations of the cell-based vaccine approach are the lack of standardised reagents and the potential safety concern regarding the introduction of adventitious agents during the cell-based vaccine manufacturing process (Ref. 110 ).",

However, the use of such a cell-derived whole-virus H5N1 vaccine with an intact haemagglutinin polybasic cleavage site represents a potential public health hazard. (Fig. 2) . Baculovirusmediated protein expression is extremely efficient under a strong polyhedrin promoter, and the expressed protein undergoes post-translational modifications similar to those occurring in mammalian cells (Refs 118, 119) . Several clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of baculovirus-expressed recombinant haemagglutinin ( Refs 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125) . Two 90 mg doses of a purified recombinant haemagglutinin from a clade 0 H5N1 virus (A/Hong Kong/156/ 1997) generated potentially protective neutralising antibody titres (1:80) in 52% of the naive subjects (Refs 125,126) . In a follow-up study eight years later in the same subjects, 68% of the subjects (now clade-0-primed), induced potentially protective titres (\u22651:40) when immunised with a single 90 mg dose of an egg-derived inactivated subvirion clade 1 vaccine (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 CDCRG1) as compared with only 45% in nonprimed subjects receiving two 90 mg doses of the same vaccine (Ref. 126 ). This suggests that prepandemic priming may reduce the global vaccine burden in a pandemic scenario. Use of better adjuvants and conserved internal protein(s) in the recombinant haemagglutinin vaccine formulations may further broaden the vaccine efficacy. DNA vaccines-DNA vaccine technology enables easy manipulation to incorporate single or multiple genes of interest in a plasmid (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, molecules that can modulate or stimulate the immune response can also be incorporated in the same plasmid to further boost the vaccine efficacy. DNA vaccines are capable of inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses with either a predominant T helper 1 (Th1)-or Th2-type response, depending on the route of DNA delivery (specifically, intramuscular injection versus gene gun delivery to the skin, respectively) ( Refs 138, 139) . While demonstrating protective efficacy in a mouse model Ad-vector-based influenza vaccines have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans ( Refs 45, 168) , and intranasal administration of a two-dose regimen of 5 \u00d7 10 8 virus particles expressing haemagglutinin from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 resulted in a fourfold increase in HI titres in 83% of the subjects in a clinical trial (Ref. 45) . Several preclinical studies have suggested HAd-vector immunity (the presence of pre-existing HAd-specific neutralising antibodies) might inhibit generation of immune responses against the transgene product (Refs 156,169), but a clinical trial specifically demonstrated that increasing the vaccine dose of an HAd-based HIV vaccine overcame the HAd-vector immunity (Ref. 170 ). Nonetheless, the use of nonhuman Ad-vector-based vaccines, either alone or as the boost component in a DNAprime and Ad-vector-boost immunisation strategy using a combination of DNA and Ad-vector antigen delivery systems ( Refs 156, 171, 172, 173, 174) , is among several alternative approaches that are being explored to circumvent the limitations of HAd-vector immunity. A bovine-origin Ad vector (bovine Ad subtype 3 or BAd)-based H5N1 vaccine (BAd-H5N1) has been shown to circumvent high levels of pre-existing HAd-vector immunity in a mouse model (Ref. 173) , and this vaccine completely protected mice against homologous H5N1 virus challenge (Ref. 173 ). In addition, a prime-boost strategy using HAd and BAd vectors generated better immune responses compared with the responses generated with either vector alone, suggesting the importance of two vector systems in improving vaccine-induced immune responses (Ref. VSV vectors have been developed as potential therapeutic and vaccine vectors for various diseases (Refs 186 ,187,188,189,190,191,192) . A recombinant VSV expressing haemagglutinin of an H5N1 virus induced robust neutralising antibody titres against the homologous and more recent antigenically distinct H5N1 viruses in mice (Ref. 193) . A single dose of the vaccine offered durable protection for up to seven months against lethal challenge with the homologous H5N1 virus (Ref. 193) . The VSV vector expressing haemagglutinin of HPAI A/ FPV/Rostock/ 1934 (H7N1), in place of the VSV G gene, protected chickens against challenge with the homologous H7N1 virus but not against the H5N2 virus (Ref. 194) . Low seroprevalence of VSV in humans makes it a suitable vector for human applications, but more preclinical studies are required to prove its usefulness for the design of a pandemic influenza vaccine.",

During the 1918 pandemic, the transfusion of convalescent human blood products from patients recovering from Spanish Flu may have been associated with a reduction in the pandemic death rate (Ref. 202 ). More recently, human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated from the blood of H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) convalescent patients resulted in protection against a homologous virus challenge in a mouse model (Ref. 203) . Several techniques to rapidly generate influenza-specific human mAbs have been described (Refs 204, 205, 206) , and these mAbs have demonstrated a broad heterosubtypic neutralising activity (Refs 204, 205) . Using a similar technique, a panel of high-affinity broad-spectrum human neutralising antibodies (nAbs) against haemagglutinin were identified, with neutralising activity against avian H5, 1918 H1, and several other human influenza subtypes (Ref. 208) . Some of these nAbs protected mice from a lethal dose of HPAI H5N1 when given before or after challenge, suggesting their prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy (Ref. 208) . In both of these studies, the broad neutralising activity of these mAbs was due to their binding to a highly conserved pocket in the stem domain of haemagglutinin, which inhibited haemagglutinin-mediated virus-host membrane fusion ( Refs 207, 208) . . Passive antibody therapy directed against conserved haemagglutinin epitopes holds promise for pandemic preparedness due to its therapeutic and prophylactic value and its potential ability to provide broad protection. These conserved epitopes could be exploited for designing a universal influenza vaccine.",

Over the years, there have been remarkable advancements in medicine to combat infectious diseases. However, the tightly interlinked modern global community has faced new challenges in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003 and in the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, where the worldwide virus spread occurred at a remarkably rapid rate in a relatively short time period that was in contrast to our understanding of influenza transmission from previous influenza pandemics.",

However, the prepandemic vaccine strategy is only as good as our ability to predict the pandemic virus strain, as amply demonstrated by the onset of the current H1N1 pandemic in the midst of our preparation for a probable H5N1 pandemic. While the egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing strategy has been the backbone of seasonal influenza vaccine production for decades, it might no longer support the massive global requirements for a pandemic vaccine. Although egg-based vaccine production in the ongoing H1N1 pandemic was initiated soon after the identification of the pandemic strain, issues such as low virus yield resulted in a delay in timely availability of enough vaccine doses. The inability of an egg-based strategy to quickly produce massive doses of necessary vaccines in a timely manner clearly emphasises the need to explore alternative, egg-independent vaccine strategies, not only to complement the existing capacity but also to ensure rapid scalability.",

Cell-derived seasonal/pandemic vaccines have looked promising in clinical trials and have been licensed in Europe; they are likely to be licensed in the near future elsewhere. VLP-based influenza vaccines are rapidly catching up as a result of their safety and immunogenicity. Vaccines based on viral vectors and DNA vaccine technologies have also gained momentum in recent years, thus adding to the growing list of egg-independent strategies for pandemic influenza vaccines. However, the lack of official calibrated reagents and assays for the evolving egg-independent technologies is a major impediment for regulatory approval. Further simplifying regulatory processes for fast-track approval of vaccines (in prepandemic and pandemic scenarios) by regulatory agencies will improve the effectiveness of a pandemic preparedness plan.",

Novel antiviral molecules with reduced risk for drug-resistance need to be identified and evaluated since currently available antivirals are rapidly losing their reliability. Recently generated mAbs directed towards conserved haemagglutinin epitopes could potentially provide a rapid and broad protection, but they require further clinical evaluation. In addition to vaccines and antivirals, however, a comprehensive pandemic preparedness plan should also include nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies that will limit the spread of the pandemic virus. Controlling the spread of the virus assumes even greater significance in the modern global interlinked environment. Development of diverse vaccine and antiviral strategies will offer flexibility in planning plausible intervention strategies for people in varied geographical and economical settings. The ongoing H1N1 pandemic may have shifted our focus from H5N1, but the threat of an H5N1 influenza pandemic still remains significant.",

The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses is also presented. (a) Influenza virus vaccine candidates are grown in eggs or certified cell lines and then chemically inactivated to generate inactivated influenza vaccine. Live attenuated influenza vaccines are generated by reassortment between an egg-adapted, cold-adapted attenuated master donor vaccine strain (which can grow to high titres in eggs, with optimum growth at 25-338C and reduced replication at 378C) and a circulating epidemic or pandemic strain, resulting in a vaccine virus that expresses six gene segments derived from the attenuated master donor strain and the remaining two gene segments (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase) derived from the circulating relevant epidemic or pandemic strain. The reassortant viruses are then propagated in eggs or certified cell lines for bulk preparation and purification. (b) Recombinant baculovirus expressing haemagglutinin (HA) protein in insect cells can be grown in bulk for influenza vaccines based on the purified immunogen. (c) Virus-like particle vaccines are highly organised particles derived from the self assembly of viral structural proteins -for example, HA, neuraminidase (NA) and matrix 1 (M1)expressed by a baculovirus/yeast vector system in insect cells. (d) DNA vaccine plasmids are designed for robust expression in the vacinee driven by a strong viral promoter and also include a polyadenylation signal. Genes encoding immune-stimulatory molecules [e.g. cytokines such as interleukin (IL)] may also be included on the same or a separate plasmid. (e) Viral-vectored vaccines are derived from a range of viruses wherein the antigenic influenza virus protein/s is/are expressed under a strong promoter. Viral vectors such as that derived from adenovirus can accommodate multiple genes encoding HA from different influenza strains/ subtypes or other influenza antigenic proteins such as conserved nucleoprotein (NP) or M2 protein, and serve as a live vaccine platform without the associated risk of infection.",

With advances in gene manipulation approaches, it is now possible to generate vaccine candidate strains without recourse to coinfection/reassortant methods. For example, vaccines can be derived from HPAI H5N1 viruses by modifying the polybasic cleavage site on the haemagglutinin gene (Refs 60,61,62), which is associated with high pathogenicity and virus spread in birds (Refs 63,64). Several such H5N1 LAIVs have shown promising results in preclinical studies (Refs 65,66). Specifically, H5N1 LAIVs generated by reverse genetics consisting of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase derived from H5N1 viruses isolated in Hong Kong and Vietnam in 1997, 2003 and 2004, with the remaining gene segments derived from the donor strain, A/Ann Arbor/6/1960 ca (H2N2), demonstrated complete protection in mice and ferrets against both homologous and antigenically heterologous H5N1 virus challenge (Ref. 66). Similarly, a single dose of a low-pathogenic H7N3 live attenuated ca virus generated by reverse genetics was completely protective in mice and ferrets against both homologous and heterologous H7 virus challenge (Ref. 67). In addition to modification of the polybasic cleavage site within haemagglutinin, manipulation of other pathogenic determinants of these HPAI viruses has also been used to develop LAIVs (Ref. 65). Specifically, an H5N1 LAIV based on A/ Vietnam/1203/2004 was attenuated through modification of the haemagglutinin cleavage site, a truncation of the C-terminus of nonstructural (NS1) protein, and an amino acid substitution in the PB2 polymerase. This vaccine provided complete protection in mice and chickens following challenge with homologous H5N1 virus (Ref. 65).",

An alum-adjuvanted inactivated splitvirion vaccine (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) elicited 67% seroconversion at the highest dose (30 mg) tested (Ref.90). Other clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity of a nonpathogenic H5N3 virus (A/Duck/Singapore/1997) adjuvanted with the squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion MF59 (Refs 87,93,94). This study demonstrated significantly higher seroconversion at a dose of 7.5 mg in the adjuvanted vaccine group compared with the nonadjuvanted vaccine group (Ref. 87). Recently, a promising dose-sparing study using an egg-derived, inactivated split vaccine (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 \u00d7 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) along with a proprietary oil-inwater emulsion-based adjuvant elicited 86% seroconversion at the lowest dose of 3.8 mg given twice (Ref. 85). Interestingly, 77% of the study subjects seroconverted for neutralising antibody titres against an antigenically dissimilar clade 2 virus, highlighting the potential for crossclade seroprotective immune responses at a low antigen dose (Ref. 85). The crossclade protective efficacy of this vaccine was amply demonstrated in a ferret model (Ref. 95). The safety and reactogenicity profile of a 15 mg haemagglutinin dose of the same proprietary oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted split virion (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 H5N1) vaccine preparation was evaluated in a multicentre, randomised, Phase III clinical trial in healthy adults and was considered clinically acceptable in the context of its use against pandemic influenza (Ref. 96). Another clinical trial evaluating an even lower dose (1.9 mg) of an influenza A/ Vietnam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1) vaccine given along with a 5% squalene-in-water emulsion-based adjuvant showed seroconversion in 72% of the study subjects (Ref. 86). A clinical trial involving 486 healthy adults (aged 18-60 years) and elderly individuals (60 years and over) with an MF59-adjuvanted clade 1(A/Vietnam/1194/2004) inactivated subunit H5N1 vaccine demonstrated comparable seroprotection in both adult and elderly populations after two doses of 7.5 or 15 mg of vaccine, ranging between 72% and 87% (Ref. 97).",

Furthermore, 80% of the subjects showed crossreactivity to a clade 2.1 variant strain (A/Indonesia/5/2005 CDCRG2) (Ref. 99).

In a dose-escalation Phase I/ II clinical trial, two 7.5 mg doses of the same Vero-cell-derived clade 1 (A/Vietnam/1203/ 2004) inactivated whole-virus vaccine resulted in virus neutralisation titres of \u226520 in 76% of the study subjects (Ref. 114).

Recently, a VLP-based human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine was launched for commercial use, emphasising the safety and immunogenicity of this approach (Refs 130,131). Furthermore, the safety and protective efficacy of this approach for the development of pandemic influenza vaccines has been evaluated in several preclinical trials (Refs 132,133,134,135). An H5N1 A/Indonesia/5/2005 VLP vaccine evaluated for its immunogenicity and safety in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial was well tolerated and immunogenic in healthy adult subjects (Ref. 136). The vaccine dose (15, 45 or 90 mg) showed a dose-dependent increase in HI titres, and the highest dose of 90 mg resulted in seroconversion (HI titres \u2265 1:40) in 63% of the study subjects (Ref. 136).

Nonetheless, development of efficient delivery systems that may result in better antigen expression and subsequent immune responses are needed (Ref. 145). DNA vaccines aiming to induce crossprotective immune responses by incorporating multiple haemagglutinin genes delivered simultaneously (Ref. 146), using a consensus haemagglutinin sequence (Ref. 147), or expressing highly conserved influenza virus proteins (such as nucleoprotein or M2) are currently being evaluated in preclinical trials (Refs 148,149,150or with a Biojector 2000 injection system was shown to be safe and efficacious in a Phase I clinical trial (Ref. 154). The vaccine induced protective antibody titres in 67% of the study subjects receiving two doses of 0.5 or 1.0 mg of vaccine (Ref. 154).The protective efficacy of a three-dose regimen of a DNA vaccine encoding H5 haemagglutinin (A/Indonesia/5/2005) following intramuscular inoculation using a Biojector is currently being evaluated (Ref.155). The safety, rapid scalability and well-defined manufacturability of DNA vaccines make this approach suitable for developing vaccines against emerging infectious diseases like influenza.Viral-vector-based vaccines-Viral vectors act as delivery vehicles that carry the gene(s) of interest into the host cell for efficient expression(Fig. 2). They serve as a live vaccine and induce robust immune responses without the associated risk of pathogenicity/infection. Viral vectors, by virtue of innate immune activators, also exert an adjuvant effect, thereby boosting the vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, the ease of incorporating multiple genes/adjuvants in a single vector may offer flexibility in vaccine design. Viral vectors can be grown to high titres in qualified cell lines in large quantities. Vectors based on a range of viruses are currently under consideration for influenza vaccines, with adenovirus-based vectors receiving particular attention.Adenoviruses possess several attributes that make them suitable candidates for vaccine vectors. They are nonpathogenic viruses capable of infecting both dividing and nondividing cells, facilitating high levels of transgene expression without integration into the host genome, and more importantly can be grown to high titres in qualified cell lines (Ref.156). Adenoviruses exert an adjuvant-like effect by stimulating the innate immune system through both Toll-likereceptor-dependent and -independent pathways (Ref.157). The effectiveness of an adenovirus (Ad)-vectored vaccines against many infectious diseases, including measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HIV, hepatitis B and Ebola, has been evaluated in human and animal models (Refs 158,159,160,161,162).The viability of a human Ad (HAd)-vectored vaccine for H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine (HAd-H5HA) in mouse and chicken models has been demonstrated (Refs 163,164,165). Two doses of 1 \u00d7 10 8 plaque-forming unit (PFU) of HAd-H5HA expressing the haemagglutinin gene of A/Hong Kong/156/1997 generated significantly high levels of virus-neutralising antibody titres, and elicited a significantly increased haemagglutinin-epitope-specific CD8+ T cell population secreting interferon \u03b3, in a mouse model (Ref.164). The vaccine protected mice against lethal challenge with homologous as well as antigenically distinct H5N1 influenza viruses (Ref.164). The immune responses humoral/cell-mediated) and the protective efficacy of HAd-H5HA vaccine persisted for at least 12 months after immunisation in mice (Ref.166). Inclusion of haemagglutinin from clade 1 and clade 2 as well as the conserved nucleoprotein in the vaccine formulation further broadened the protective efficacy of HAdbased H5N1 vaccines, thereby offering complete protection in mice against challenge with either clade 1 or clade 2 virus (Ref.167).",

            "text": "vectors of potential interest for influenza vaccines include those based on alphavirus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and pox virus. Vectors based on alphaviruses (positive-strand RNA viruses) have primarily been developed using Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Sindbis or Semliki Forest viruses (Ref. 175), and have shown protection in numerous models for infectious diseases, including influenza, HPV and Ebola (Refs 176,177,178,139). Alphavirus replicon particles expressing the haemagglutinin gene from an H5N1 isolate (A/Hong Kong/156/1997) were shown to be protective in chickens (Ref. 177). Another alphavirus, expressing haemagglutinin from A/ Wyoming/03/2003 (H3N2), was immunogenic in preclinical studies in mice, rabbits and macaques (Ref. 179). A Phase I clinical trial using the same H3N2 vaccine induced protective HI titres in 77% and 80% of subjects receiving a single dose of low-and high-concentration vaccine, respectively (Ref. 180). A second immunisation in these individuals enhanced seroprotective responses to 86% for both dosage levels and extended the duration of T cell responses as compared with the single immunisation (Ref. 180). NDV vectors have demonstrated immunogenicity and protective efficacy against HPAI in several preclinical studies in mouse and chicken models (Refs 181,182). Reverse genetics technology has helped in developing NDV as a safe and efficacious vaccine vector (Ref. 183), and both the natural mucosal route of infection by NDV and the high degree of attenuation of this virus in primates make it suitable as a vaccine vector for humans for the control of respiratory virus infections such as influenza (Ref. 184). A live attenuated NDV-based vaccine expressing haemagglutinin (NDV-HA) of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/ 1203/2004) was highly attenuated in nonhuman primates, and a single inoculation by both the intranasal and intratracheal routes with 10 7 PFU of NDV-HA per site induced substantial serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses (Ref. 185).",

The broad heterosubtypic activity of these mAbs might be due to their specificity towards a conserved region of the haemagglutinin stem domain (Ref. 205). Furthermore, the CR6261 epitope on haemagglutinin was recently characterised and the mechanism of neutralisation established by elucidating the crystal structure of the antibody bound to the haemagglutinins from the 1918 H1N1 and 2004 H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) viruses (Ref. 207).",
