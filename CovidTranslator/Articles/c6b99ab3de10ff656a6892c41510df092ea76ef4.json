In brief, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) vaccine strain TC-83 and Ebola virus (EBOV) variant Makona isolate C05 stock IRF0137 (EBOV/Mak-C05) were grown and RNA isolated from clarified cell-culture supernatants. VEEV TC-83 was prepared from stocks derived from United States Army Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC-83 stocks. One MOI of VEEV TC-83 was adsorbed on Vero E6 monolayers for 2 hours. After 48 h of incubation in Minimum Essential Medium-\u03b1 + 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, Gaithersburg, MD;",

VEEV reads were also aligned against a database of alphavirus genome sequences (1,440 total entries; detailed below).

After cDNA synthesis, cDNA/RNA hybrids were prepared for nanopore sequencing (DEV-MAP003) by purifying RNA/cDNA hybrids using 0.7\u00d7 Agencourt AmPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) followed by 2\u00d7 80% ethanol washes. Purified RNA/cDNA hybrids were then incubated with binding buffer for 45 min (ONT; DEV-MAP003), motor protein for 5 min (ONT; DEV-MAP003), then loading buffer for 5 min (ONT; DEV-MAP003) per the manufacturers protocol (ONT; DEV-MAP003). Prepared libraries were then diluted per manufacturers protocol with water and fuel mix (ONT; DEV-MAP003) to a final volume of 300 \u03bcl, with 150 \u03bcL sequencing solution loaded with p1000 tips onto individual MinION flow cells (7.3) for sequencing. Data Collection and Analysis Data were collected in real time using Oxford Nanopore software (VEEV: MinKNOW: 0.50.1.15, Metrichor: 1.13.1; EBOV: MinKNOW: 0.48.2.14, Metrichor: 1.10.1) and analyzed for genome alignment using LAST-648 (1) (lastal) with the options (-s 2 -T 0 -Q 0 -a 1).",
