Even before this pandemic, the high prevalence of burnout, complex causes, and critical consequences had been widely reported [1, 2] . Many institutional and individual interventions have been advocated to address burnout and promote wellness including decreased workload, improved work schedules and electronic health record, mindfulness (including MBSR Q3 ) and personal coaching [1] [2] [3] . The need for effective strategies and tools is only increasing as both individuals and institutions navigate the current anxiety and uncertainty.",

This quick practice can aid well-being [7] . Sexton and Adair studied a similar practiced called \"Three Good Things\" in health care workers including physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and 3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53 administrative staff. They found that a 15-day practice of recording three good things had significant positive benefits on self-reported happiness, burnout, work-life balance, and depression [8] . Extending gratitude practices into groups, such as starting meetings by giving kudos for recent efforts, can also help stimulate positive emotions and positive relationships among team members. Clearly many good things are happening in the midst of all the stress and swirl-the dedication of so many, kindness and consideration for those most at risk, and emotional support. To help us survive, our minds are biased to notice risks and danger; consciously noticing the good can help bring balance and calm.",

While learning about these micropractices, they also gain practical tips from their colleagues' hard-earned wisdom and experience. One radiologist reported tracking her tension level during a busy workday. If the level is high and she gets a flurry of questions from technologists, she has learned to pause and consciously respond with the statement, \"I just need a minute.\" This simple phrase gives her time to settle and then offer a more connecting response, rather than a reflexive reaction.

This involves inhaling deeply by expanding the lungs downward rather than inhaling using the abdomen or rib cage alone [9] . Inhaling is done through the nose, with a pause before exhaling slowly and completely through the mouth. Some find silent counting during inhalation and exhalation helpful to establish a respiratory rate of six to eight breaths per minute (eg, inhale for a count of 5 seconds, pause, and exhale for a count of 5 seconds for a respiratory rate of approximately six breaths per minute).",

The mechanism is thought to act by increasing parasympathetic activation. Given that diaphragmatic breathing is low cost, self-administered, nonpharmacological, and highly portable, it is easy to try (provided no prohibiting health conditions exist). Further study is needed to better define its mechanism and efficacy and the minimal time needed for positive benefits. One study has noted statistically significant benefits on blood pressure with one 10-min session of diaphragmatic breathing [9] .",
