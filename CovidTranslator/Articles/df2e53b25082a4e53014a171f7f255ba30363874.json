The S1 protein, which contains several virus neutralization epitopes, is considered to be a target site of vaccine development. However, although protective immune responses could be induced by recombinant S1 protein, the protection rate in chickens was still low (<50%). Here, we generated fused S1 proteins with HA2 protein (rS1-HA2) or transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (rS1-H3(TM)) from hemagglutinin of H3N2 influenza virus. After immunization, animals vaccinated with fusion proteins rS1-HA2 and rS1-H3(TM) demonstrated stronger robust humoral and cellular immune responses than that of rS1 and inactivated M41 vaccine. The protection rates of groups immunized with rS1-HA2 (87%) were significantly higher than the groups inoculated with rS1 (47%) and inactivated M41 vaccine (53%). And chickens injected with rS1-H3(TM) had similar level of protection (73%) comparing to chickens vaccinated with rS1 (47%) (P = 0.07). Our data suggest that S1 protein fused to the HA2 or TM proteins from hemagglutinin of H3N2 influenza virus may provide a new strategy for high efficacy recombinant vaccine development against IBV.",

Though both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines are used worldwide to control the disease, IBV occasionally outbreaks in endemic areas (Bijlenga et al., 2004; Cavanagh, 2003) . The use of attenuated live-vaccines elicits local, systemic and cell-mediated immunity to the virus (Cavanagh, 2003; Raj and Jones, 1997) , but poses a risk of residual pathogenicity associated with vaccine backpassage in flocks (Abro et al., 2012; McKinley et al., 2008; McKinley et al., 2011) . Though the inactivated IB vaccines are relatively safe, they are efficacious only when used as boosters after priming vaccination with live vaccines (Ladman et al., 2002) . Thus to develop a safer, more efficacious and economic vaccine candidate is of great interest for scientific research.",

It is intriguing for us to know whether recombinant hemagglutinin and S protein can also induce better immunogenicity and protective efficacy against IBV infections. In this study, we first investigated whether the recombinant S protein could induce better immune responses. Therefore, we generated a recombinant S1 (rS1) protein and two recombinant S1 fusion proteins, rS1-H3(TM) (fused with the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) of influenza H3N2 HA protein) and rS1-HA2 (fused with the HA2 domain of influenza H3N2 HA protein).

A Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system was used for the production of recombinant expression bacmids and baculoviruses. Briefly, IBV-M41 S1 gene, H3(TM) and HA2 fragments (GenBank accession number FJ830855.1) from H3N2 strain (A/swine/Guangdong/01/1998) were first amplified and cloned into pMD-18T vector (Takara) and then amplified sequentially. S1-H3(TM) and S1-HA2 fusion genes were then generated by overlapped PCR and cloned between the SalI and Hind\u0428 sites of pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) to generate recombinant shuttle plasmids (Fig. 1A) . The shuttle vectors were then chemically transformed into competent DH10Bac TM Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). All clones were verified by sequencing (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus generation and infection were performed as previously described (Liu et al., 2013) . Briefly, the obtained recombinant bacmids were transfected into Sf9 cells and incubated for 3 days. The target recombinant baculoviruses (rBVs) were then harvested from the supernatant. The structure of the recombinant fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 1B. ",

Morbidity, tracheal infections, renal infections and protection rates after challenge are summarized in Table 3 . In general, chickens immunized with inactivated M41 vaccine, rS1, rWT and PBS developed symptoms as dyspnea, coughing and rales on a different level. To further evaluate the level of protection after challenge, RT-PCR was performed to detect viral RNA in the collected tracheas and kidneys. Chickens vaccinated with rS1 (47%) presented a similar protection level comparing to chickens immunized with the inactivated M41 virus (53%). However, chickens immunized with rS1-HA2 were better protected (87%) comparing to chickens vaccinated with rS1 (47%) and inactivated M41 (53%) (P < 0.05), while chickens injected with rS1-H3(TM) had similar level of protection (73%) comparing to chickens vaccinated with rS1 (47%) (P = 0.07). There was a significant difference between the rS1-HA2-vaccinated group and the rS1-immunized group (p < 0.05) in the number of collected tracheas and kidneys that were positive for the virus. These data further confirm our previous data presenting better immunogenesis of the fused S1 proteins and suggest that these fused proteins, especially rS1-HA2 protein, can provide a new strategy for IBV vaccine development.",

One interesting thing is that, two weeks after booster vaccination (day 28), the antibody level induced by recombinant S1 protein was lower than that of inactivated virus in our study.

The CD4 + T-cell responses provide help for B-cells to mature and generate specific antibodies as well as directly antiviral cytokines, increase the proliferation, maturation, and functional activity of CD8 + CTL (Doherty et al., 1997; Kotani et al., 2000) . In this study, we found an significant increase of the CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocyte subgroups in chickens immunized with rS1-H3(TM) and rS1-HA2, comparing to the rS1 and inactivated M41 vaccine groups. The ratio of CD3 + CD8 + to CD3 + CD4 + T lymphocytes in chickens immunized with rS1-H3(TM) or rS1-HA2 was greater than that in chickens inoculated with rS1 and inactivated M41 vaccine.
