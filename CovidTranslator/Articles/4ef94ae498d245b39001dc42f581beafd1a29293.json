            "text": "Human-to-human transmission has been relatively inefficient such that no major human outbreaks have occurred. However, more than 240 human cases and 140 deaths have been reported since 2003. 2 In adults, SARS usually results in rapidly progressive disease, and approximately 20% of infected adults develop respiratory failure. 3, 4 Children infected with SARS usually develop symptoms of mild upper respiratory infection or uncomplicated pneumonia, [5] [6] [7] but the reported mortality rate for children infected with avian flu has been close to 50%. 8 In this paper, we will review the lessons we have learnt from the outbreak of SARS to illustrate how we can prepare for the possible major outbreak or even pandemic of avian influenza infection in humans. PAEDIATRIC Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza are two important newly emerged infections with pandemic potential. Both infections have crossed the species barrier to infect humans. SARS originated from southern China and spread to many countries in early 2003. The close collaboration of scientists around the world resulted in a rapid identification of the causative agent, and the early isolation of infected cases and meticulous infection control measures were the key to successfully controlling the outbreak of SARS. The first outbreak of human cases of avian influenza was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. Since 2003, there have been many small outbreaks of human cases around the world, and the reported mortality is greater than 50%. Current evidence suggests that the human-to-human transmission of avian influenza is rather inefficient, but mutation might occur in the future resulting in improved transmission and possibly a pandemic in humans. As with the outbreak of SARS, the development of sensitive and accurate early diagnostic tests is extremely important for successful control of the outbreak at source. The availability of isolation facilities, the stockpiling of antiviral agents and effective and safe vaccination will be extremely important in minimising the damage of a new influenza pandemic. \u00df 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For many adult and paediatric patients, their initial chest radiographs may be normal, while early thoracic computer tomography may show poorly defined, ground-glass opacification of the lung in the subpleural areas. 4, 7 The typical course of illness in infected adults has been described as triphasic. 3 The initial phase is characterised by fever, chills, myalgia, cough and other constitutional symptoms. The second phase is associated with progressive clinical and radiological deterioration, and increasing oxygen requirements. The clinical progression is believed to be due to an exaggerated host immune response to the SARS-CoV. About 25% of patients will progress further to respiratory failure in the subsequent 2 weeks. Gradual recovery is expected in over 80% of patients by 3-4 weeks into the illness. Those patients with more severe disease may show the typical laboratory findings such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and an elevation of liver enzymes. 7 A community-wide serological screening of 12,000 people in Hong Kong found an extremely low rate (0.008%) of asymptomatic SARS infection. 13 On the other hand, a recent case-control study in children did not reveal any clinical or initial laboratory results that might reliably differentiate SARS from pneumonia resulting from other viral or bacterial aetiologies. 12 In the early period of the epidemic, the major difficulty was the lack of a reliable and sensitive test for this infection.",

Approximately 25% of adults will deteriorate progressively to respiratory failure requiring intensive care support, 14 while fewer than 1% of infected children develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. 15 It has been postulated that the SARS-CoV may behave like H5N1 influenza virus and act as a potent inducer of proinflammatory cytokines. There is evidence to show that H5N1 influenza may upregulate the production of various cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-a. 16 Such a cytokine storm may be partly responsible for such severe multiorgan involvement in adult patients. Longitudinal studies in children infected with SARS-CoV, however, have not revealed any significant elevation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-a.",

Since SARS was shortly found to be caused by a coronavirus, ribavirin was widely used in treating adult cases in Hong Kong. Autopsy findings in fatal adult cases revealed diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates. 4 This led to the suggestion that an exaggerated immune response might be the possible pathophysiological process leading to the severe damage of the lungs and other organs.",

As a result, both adults and severely affected adolescents were treated with steroids and ribavirin. However, subsequent experimental data revealed that ribavirin was most likely ineffective against SARS-associated coronavirus. 18 The use of corticosteroids with this possibly ineffective antiviral agent in patients with coronavirus pneumonia can be detrimental. In fact, many adult patients eventually died of other nosocomial infections, 19 and such infections might be related to the excessive immunosuppression associated with the use of high-dose corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, 15% of adult patients in one series developed avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and 6% had bilateral involvement. 19 It is important to note that steroids and ribavirin were not used in many other centres during the outbreak in 2003, and the mortality rates of their patients were similar to or better than that of patients treated with such a combination. 20, 21 When we are faced with a new disease, especially one as deadly as SARS, physicians are often tempted to try new treatments based on anecdotal experience. The argument of trying new therapy is that we should not be withholding potentially useful treatment. However, we must remember the principles of evidence-based medicine as we may be protecting our patients by withholding potentially harmful treatment too. Although it may not be easy when we encounter a large number of patients affected by a new infection, one should test any new and potentially useful treatment modality in a systematic way to document its efficacy before recommending it for all patients.",

The common presenting features are fever and symptoms of respiratory tract infection, including cough, sore throat and rhinorrhoea. Similar to other influenza infections, headache, myalgia, vomiting and sputum production have also commonly been reported. The disease usually progresses rapidly within the first week to respiratory failure. 8, 27 The initial radiological findings include multifocal or patchy infiltrates and segmental or lobar consolidation. As the patients progress to respiratory failure, the chest radiographs show diffuse, bilateral ground-glass consolidation. Many patients develop multiorgan failure resulting in death in the second week. The median time from the onset of illness to respiratory failure has been reported to be range from 4 to 13 days. Laboratory studies have typically revealed lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated aminotransferase levels. Increased risk of mortality has been reported to be associated with marked lymphopenia. 32 The laboratory diagnosis can be made by viral isolation or the detection of H5-specific RNA by a molecular method.",

Furthermore, many species of birds can carry the virus without any apparent signs of illness. The occurrence of many minioutbreaks and possible human-to-human transmission gives us forewarnings of a possible pandemic. Eventually, mutation of the avian virus may occur, resulting in a strain that is very efficient in transmission among humans, and a pandemic resulting in significant global morbidity and mortality may become a reality.",

Clinicians have to be alerted to unusual clusters of severe pneumonia, especially in the presence of epidemiological links such as recent exposure to wild birds and poultry or travel to endemic areas. The development of sensitive and accurate early diagnostic tests is a top priority for the successful control of the outbreak at its source. The outbreak of SARS has taught us that the effective isolation of infected cases and border control will be of paramount importance to minimise the impact of avian influenza when outbreaks of human cases do occur. With all the important lessons learnt during the SARS outbreak, it is hoped that we will be able to minimise the damage of a new influenza pandemic.",
