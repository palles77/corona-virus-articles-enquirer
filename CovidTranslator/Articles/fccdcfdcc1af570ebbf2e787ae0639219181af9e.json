            "text": "private residential drinking water wells, one dewatering well at a lignite mine, eight surface water sites, and lignite from an active coal mine were sampled in five Parishes of northwestern Louisiana, USA. Using a geographic information system (GIS), wells were selected that were likely to draw water that had been in contact with lignite; control wells were located in areas devoid of lignite deposits. Well water samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity, organic compounds, and nutrient and anion concentrations. All samples were further tested for presence of fungi (cultures maintained for up to 28 days and colonies counted and identified microscopically) and for metal and trace element concentration by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry and atomic emission spectrometry. Surface water samples were tested for dissolved oxygen and presence of pathogenic leptospiral bacteria. The Spearman correlation method was used to assess the association between the endpoints for these field/laboratory analyses and incidence of cancer of the renal pelvis (RPC) based on data obtained from the Louisiana Tumor Registry for the five Parishes included in the study. Significant associations were revealed between the cancer rate and the presence in drinking water of organic compounds, the fungi Zygomycetes, the nutrients PO 4 and NH 3 , and 13 chemical elements. Presence of human pathogenic leptospires was detected in four out of eight (50%) of the surface water sites sampled. The present study of a stable rural \u00d3 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006 population examined possible linkages between aquifers containing chemically reactive lignite deposits, hydrologic conditions favorable to the leaching and transport of toxic organic compounds from the lignite into the groundwater, possible microbial contamination, and RPC risk.",

            "text": "The state of Louisiana, which is situated between the states of Texas and Mississippi along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in the southeastern USA, has the sixth highest mortality rate for cancer of the renal pelvis (RPC) in the United States (Ries et al., 2001) . Many rural residents in the northwestern part of the state rely on well water for drinking, cooking, and other domestic uses. Northwestern Louisiana contains sizeable lignite (low-rank coal) deposits associated with fresh water aquifers. These deposits naturally contain nephrotoxic compounds that may potentially contaminate ground water used as residential water supplies. The possibility of a link between lignite deposits, drinking water derived from rural wells, and RPC in Louisiana has been proposed based on the results of investigations that have been carried out in Eastern Europe into Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and urothelial cancers and urinary tract cancers such as RPC (Tatu, Orem, Finkelman, & Feder, 1998) . BEN occurs in restricted geographic areas characterized by lignite deposits, stable rural populations, and untreated, non-municipally supplied water sources (Tanchev, Evstatiev, Dorossiev, Penchava, & Zvetkov, 1956) . The etiology of BEN has not been firmly established, is possibly multifactorial (Toncheva, Dimitrov, & Stojanova, 1998) , and may involve toxic organic compounds such as nitrogen-containing aromatic hydrocarbons . These hydrocarbons have been identified in samples of lignite and well water from endemic regions (Orem & Tatu, 2001; Orem et al., 2002; Tatu et al., 2000) . Previous investigations have identified markedly different suites of compounds in water of known BEN areas as compared to non-endemic area control samples (Tatu et al., 2000) . Microbial pathogens and their products, such as fungal ochratoxin-A (OTA), have also been implicated in the causation of BEN (Abouzied et al., 2002; Fillastre, 1997; Pfohl-Leszkowicz, Petkova-Bocharova, Chernozemsky, & Castegnaro, 2002; Stoev, 1998; Uzelac-Keserovic et al., 1999) . However, studies performed in Romania were unable to find OTA or OTA degradation products in biological samples (urine) collected from BEN patients (C. Tatu, unpublished data) .",

The association between BEN and urinary tract tumors was also recognized early on (Petrinska-Venkovska, 1960) . Thus, BEN is not only a nephrological problem but also an oncological one. Petrinska-Venkovska (1960) reported that of 33 BEN patients studied, 48.4% developed urinary-tract tumors. Tanchev, Naidenov, Dimitrov, and Karlova (1970) reported a similar finding, with 16% of the BEN patients in their study developing urinary-tract tumors. More recent evidence suggests that up to one-half of all BEN patients suffer from these cancers (Orem & Tatu, 2001; Radonic & Radosevic, 1992) . The relative risk of developing urinary-tract tumors among residents of BEN-endemic villages was calculated to be as high as 29 in an epidemiological study in the Vratza district, Bulgaria (Nikolov et al., 1996) . Chernozemsky et al. (1977) noted a geographic correlation between BEN and renal tumors in Bulgaria and Serbia. A similar correlation has been found in Romania (Minciu, Botoca, Cumpanas, & Hodor, 2003) . The prognosis for RPC is generally poor, and successful treatment rare (Kirkali & Tuzel, 2003) .",

Most of the lignite occurs in Lower Tertiary strata (Mea-gher & Aycock, 1942; Roland et al., 1976) . Similar lignite deposits extend from Texas, passing through parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to terminate in Georgia (Tully, 1996) ; these occur chiefly in the Wilcox Group and, to a lesser extent, in the overlying stratigraphic units of the Claiborne and Jackson Groups (Roland et al., 1976) . A complete list of Louisiana lignite localities was compiled in 1921 (Glenk) , including every location where lignite was known to outcrop. At present, lignite outcrops have been reported in 13 parishes in northern Louisiana, including DeSoto, Natchitoches, and Red River. However, the issue is not one of mere presence as a surface outcrop, but whether lignite deposits are present in freshwater aquifers currently used by the general population. Of particular interest, Glenk (1921) also compiled a list of localities where both water wells and oil wells occurred in lignite deposits. One of these, the Tertiary-Age freshwater Carizzo-Wilcox Aquifer, serves parts of eight parishes in northern Louisiana at a ground water use rate of about 15 million gallons per day (Sargent, 2002) .",

Study site selection and analysis required geologic, geochemical, microbiological, and epidemiological approaches.

To address seasonal variability that might lead to differences in precipitation and ground water activity during different times of the year, we selected a second sampling time point roughly 6 months from the initial sampling event. Thus, in September, 2002, those same wells and sites plus four additional surface water sites were sampled in five parishes (DeSoto, Natchitoches, Rapides, Red River, and Vernon) of northwestern Louisiana. Additionally, dewatering well water and lignite samples were collected from an active coal mine in Red River Parish. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to select 12 residential water wells located in the lignite aquifer area that were likely to be drawing water directly from or just below lignite beds based on the following themes: well depth, lignite bed thickness, amount of overburden, depth of lignite bed below surface, mining lease areas, and geology. Additionally, computer software (STRATI-FACT, ver. 4.57; Stratifact Software, Wheat Ridge, Colo.) was used to compare known depths and thicknesses of lignite deposits (based on geophysical well logs) with drinking water well locations and depths (data on file at the Louisiana District Office of USGS, Ruston, LA.). In both May and September, two of the 14 private wells in Vernon Parish served as ''control wells,'' since they were located in the coastal lowlands aquifer (all of the sample wells were located in the Mississippi embayment aquifer system), and coincided with neither the Wilcox Group nor any known lignite (or coal) beds.",

Exposure to ochratoxins and leptospires, both found in many of the well and surface water samples tested, may contribute to kidney compromise and RPC susceptibility in this region.

The overall mean number of organic compounds detected in the sample wells was 104.9, while that of the control wells was only 60.0 (Fig. 2b) . When those organic data were statistically correlated with RPC incidence, a strong association between the overall number of organic compounds extracted from the water (b=1.0000, p < 0.0001) was observed, as was a slightly weaker association between RPC incidence and overall relative concentration (b=0. 8000, p=0.2000) . This finding is noteworthy because many of the compounds accounting for the organic compound concentration in the control (as well as the test well) water samples were not lignite aquifer-derived; rather, they were identified as anthropogenic phthalates and phthalic derivatives, ubiquitous compounds (plasticizers) commonly found in relatively high concentrations in well water. These compounds are thus more likely over-represented with respect to their relative concentration values, but the overall number of compounds is not. The fact that the number of individual compounds (or classes of compounds) in the samples versus controls were significantly correlated to RPC incidence, with the relative concentrations less strongly associated, suggests that only a small subset of the organic compounds present in the well water actually contributes to cancer risk. The fact that many of the phthalate peaks, while few in number, are relatively high (corresponding to their generally high concentrations) in the control samples suggests that the lignite-derived organic compounds, and not the more uniformly distributed naturally-occurring or anthropogenic organics (phthalates), are associated with RPC incidence. If this were not the case, one would likely not observe a statistically significant difference between the sample and control groups for either organic measure (number or concentration of compounds).",

Our intention was to analyze the water that residents were actually consuming (while being as unobtrusive as possible; thus water was generally sampled from outdoor spigots rather than from kitchen sinks), which in most cases meant that the water contacted plastic at some point(s) between extraction from the lignite aquifer and ingestion. Such potential contacts included PVC well casings and any plastic parts in the pump or delivery system (e.g., spigots, tubing, hoses, etc.). Subtracting out the phthalate peaks from the total ion chromatograms would run the risk of inadvertently deleting smaller peaks masked by the phthalates -peaks that could represent lignite-derived hydrocarbons with molecular mass to charge ratios similar to those of the phthalates. Some of the other factors, such as ochratoxinproducing fungi and inorganic chemical elements, may contribute to kidney disease, but these do not account for the apparent geographic association of RPC incidence to lignite deposits. At a cellular level, necrosis of kidney tissue may in fact be a more likely outcome of OTA exposure rather than tumorigenesis, as it induced apoptosis in an in vitro experimental study (Schwerdt, Freudinger, Mildenberger, Silbernagl, & Gekle, 1999) . However, OTA was found to have possible carcinogenic potential to renal tubular cells in a rat model (Boorman, 1989) .",

Of the thirteen chemical elements found to be significantly linked to RPC incidence in our analysis, two (chromium and strontium) were measured in the remains of BEN fatalities in a previous investigation in the Balkans (Makarov, Topakbashyan, & Dinev, 1967) . In that study, Cr was detected at elevated levels in only three of 16 samples (Makarov et al., 1967) . An environmental source of Cr in hemodialysis patients cannot be assumed, as needles used in that treatment procedure release substantial amounts of Cr to the body (Gallieni, Brancaccio, Cozzolino, & Sabbioni, 1996) .

The other elements found to be present at high levels (Al, Zn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Mn) in that earlier study (Makarov et al., 1967) were not significantly associated with RPC incidence in our analysis.

One limitation of the present analysis is that tumor registry data were available only at the Parish level of geographic scale. Future studies are planned that will take advantage of the fine geospatial referencing of the environmental database by incorporating cancer data at a finer scale of resolution (e.g., aggregated at the census block level) that is expected to be made available. Future epidemiologic studies involving human subjects will need to control for cigarette smoking, as this risk factor is a likely cause of RPC (Armstrong, Garrod, & Doll, 1976; McLaughlin, Blot, Devesa, & Fraumeni, 1996) , as well as for analgesic abuse, another known cause for RPC, upper urinary tract cancer, and chronic renal failure (Kirkali & Tuzel, 2003) .",

            "text": "Overall, the presence of hydrocarbons and microbes with known or suspected links to kidney disease, including cancer of the renal pelvis (RPC) appears to be greater in ground water sources derived from lignite aquifers of the Wilcox group in northwestern Louisiana than in water from nearby sources not coincident with known lignite or coal deposits. Some of the organic compounds found in the water samples are structurally similar to those found in lignite collected from a commercial lignite mine in the area, suggesting that lignite beds may in fact be the source of some of the water contaminants identified in residents' wells. The infection of humans by pathogenic leptospires that were found in 50% of the surface water sites in the studied region provides an additional potential aggravating factor contributing to high rates of kidney diseases, including cancer. Preliminary epidemiological evidence suggests that there are significant associations between organic compounds in well water and several other variables measured and kidney cancer rates. Future work is planned to conduct additional water sampling and to investigate biological and toxicological mechanisms to test for causation in the observed statistical correlation.",
