Virus grown in these cells was used to isolate and purify the HE-protein . This protein has been shown recently to have acetylesterase activity and to function as the receptor-destroying enzyme of BCV . Here we show that HEV contains this enzyme, too . The glycoproteins were solubilized by treatment of virions with octylglucoside . Following centrifugation through a sucrose gradient the surface proteins S and HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) were obtained in purified form . After removal of the detergent by dialysis, HE formed rosettes as shown by electron microscopy . The purified HE protein retained acetylesterase activity and was able to function as a receptor-destroying enzyme rendering red blood cells resistant against agglutination by both coronaviruses . H E protein released from the viral membrane failed to agglutinate red blood cells . However, it was found to recognize glycoconjugates containing N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as indicated by a binding assay with rat serum proteins blotted to nitrocellulose and by its ability to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of BCV, HEV, and influenza C virus .

            "text": "It has been reported recently that bovine coronavirus (BCV) contains a receptor-destroying enzyme (Vlasak et al., 1 988a) . This is the first example of such an enzyme present on a positive-stranded RNA virus . Up to then, receptor-destroying enzymes have been known as structural components only of negative-stranded RNA viruses : influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses (Hirst, 1950) . Influenza A and B viruses as well as paramyxoviruses inactivate their receptors by means of a neuraminidase which releases terminal sialic acid from glycoconjugates (Klenk et al ., 1955) . The receptordestroying enzyme of influenza C virus, on the other hand, cleaves not a glycosidic linkage but rather an ester linkage . It has been identified as an acetylesterase (Herrler et at, 1985c) , which is able to release acetate from various synthetic substrates (Vlasak et at, 1987 ; Schauer et al., 1988) . The receptor-destroying activity, however, is due to the release of the acetyl group from position C-9 of N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Acz ) (Herrler et al., 1 985c) . The 9-O-acetyl residue is crucial for the ability of influenza C virus to recognize a glycoprotein as a receptor (Herrler et at, 1985c ; Rogers et al., 1986) .",

The acetylesterase activity of BCV has been shown to be a function of the glycoprotein HE (Vlasak et al., 1988b) , the amino acid sequence of which has been derived from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned mRNA (Parker et al., 1989) . Interestingly, this protein is present only on some coronaviruses, while others, such as avian infectious bronchitis virus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and feline infectious peritonitis virus, are lacking a corresponding protein . The genome of MHV-A59 contains an open reading frame coding for an HE protein, which is, however, not expressed in infected cells (Luytjes et al., 1988 ; Shieh et al., 1989) . Other murine coronaviruses contain such a protein (Sugiyama and Amano, 1980 ; Shieh et al., 1989) and the HE protein of the strain MHV-JHM has been shown to have acetylesterase activity Pfleiderer et all 1990) .",

Strain Johannesburg/1 /66 of influenza C virus was found to grow to high titers in this cell line, while another subline-MDCK II-was resistant to infection because of a lack of cell surface receptors (Herrler and Klenk, 1987 ; Szepanski et al ., 1989) . Due to the similarity of the erythrocyte receptors for BCV ISOLATION OF THE ACETYLESTERASE OF CORONAVIRUSES 2 2 3 and influenza C virus, we tried to grow BCV in MDCK I cells . Strain L-9 of BCV, which had been grown previously in bovine cell cultures (Storz and Rott, 1981) , was able to replicate in MDCK I cells without adaptation . Hemagglutination titers of 256 HAU/ml were determined in the supernatant 48 hr p .i . The same growth kinetics was observed with strain NT-9 of HEV, which had been grown previously in porcine cell cultures (Hess and Bachmann, 1978) . These titers are equally high as or higher than those reported for BCV and HEV in other cell lines . Both MDCK-grown coronaviruses were found to have acetylesterase activity . Comparing virus suspensions with the same HA titer, the ability of both viruses to release acetate from p-nitrophenyl acetate was similar, HEV being somewhat more active than BCV (Fig . 1 ) . As expected from previous studies with influenza C virus and BCV (Muchmore and Varki, 1987 ; Vlasak et al., 1 988b) , the esterase activity of the MDCK-grown coronaviruses was abolished after treatment with DFP . This compound inhibits serine esterases and proteases by covalently attaching to the active-site serine . Up to the time of virus harvest no cytopathic changes were detectable in the monolayer of MDCK I cells infected with either BCV or HEV . Virions released into the medium were purified by centrifugation into a sucrose gradient and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . As shown in Fig . 2 for HEV, following Coomassie staining of the gel, the major bands visible are the known structural polypeptides : the nucleocapsid protein N, the membrane protein M, the surface protein S, and the hemagglutinin-esterase protein HE . The latter polypeptide is detected under nonreducing conditions as a disulfide-linked dimer, (HE) z . Several other coronaviruses require two rounds of gradient centrifugation for a satisfying degree of purification . Using the MDCK cell system a single gradient centrifugation step is sufficient to obtain both BCV and HEV in purified form .",

However, it was found to have a low hemagglutination-inhibition activity ; i .e ., purified HE was able to prevent intact virions (BCV or HEV) from agglutinating erythrocytes . This finding suggests that, following purification, HE is still able to attach to coronavirus receptors on red blood cells . However, this interaction appears not to be sufficient for agglutination of erythrocytes . The ability of purified HE to bind to Neu5,9AcZ containing receptors was further analyzed by a solid-phase binding assay . Rat serum is known to be a potent hemagglutination-inhibitor of influenza C virus (Styk, 1955) as well as of BCV and HEV (Schultze et al ., 1990) . The inhibitory activity of rat serum is mainly due to al -macroglobulin (Herrler et al., 1985b ; Kitame at al., 1985) , which has been shown to contain a substantial amount of Neu5,9Ac z (Herrler at at, 1 985c) . BCV and purified HE from this virus were analyzed for their ability to bind to rat serum which had been spotted on a nitrocellulose filter . As shown in Fig .  7 (left lane), attachment of BCV to rat serum could be demonstrated . Purified HE gave a positive result in this assay only at the highest concentration of rat serum tested (compare sections designated BCV and HE) . If HE was pretreated with DFP, however, to inactivate the esterase activity, binding of HE protein to rat serum was as efficient as binding of whole virus (compare sections designated BCV and HE-DFP) . To find out whether attachment of BCV and HE-protein was mediated by Neu5,9Ac z , the serum proteins blotted on the nitrocellulose were preincubated with either acetylesterase or sodium hydroxide . Both treatments are known to release 9-O-acetyl residues from NeuS, 9Ac 2 . Preincubation of the serum proteins at alkaline pH completely abolished binding of both BCV and HE protein, while attachment of influenza A virus (strain WSN) could still be demonstrated (Fig . 7 , middle lane) . Pretreatment of serum proteins with acetylesterase from influenza C virus (HEF) drastically reduced binding of BCV, HE, or DFP-treated HE protein (Fig . 7, right lane) . These results indicate that purified HE protein is able to recognize NeuS,9Ac 2 as a receptor determinant for attachment to glycoproteins . Binding of HE is, however, less efficient than binding of whole virions and can be increased by inactivation of the esterase .",

With vesicular stomatitis virus it has been shown that virus entry and release is restricted to the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane . Influenza A virus, on the other hand can infect MDCK cells from both the apical and the basolateral side, whereas budding of the virus is restricted to the apical portion of the plasma membrane (Rodriguez-Boulan and Sabatini, 1978 ; Fuller et at, 1984) .

Using the protocol described it was possible to get a complete separation of the coronavirus proteins HE, 5, and M . A similar method using Triton X-100 rather than octylglucoside had been used previously to purify the glycoproteins of HEV (Callebaut and Pensaert, 1980) . As Triton X-1 00 cannot be removed by dialysis, these authors used butanol precipitation to obtain detergent-free glycoprotein . HE prepared in this way was unable to agglutinate red blood cells . At that time the esterase activity as well as the ability of this virus to recognize Neu5,9Ac2 as a receptor determinant was unknown . Using octylglucoside as a detergent we obtained both HE and S in purified form . The isolated S-protein was also subject to a biochemical and functional analysis (manuscript in preparation) . The sedimentation behavior of the isolated HE protein was similar to that of IgG . Considering the molecular weight of the monomeric glycoprotein (Parker et at, 1989) , a dimeric structure is suggested for the purified HE protein . Dinners of HE are also detected following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions (see Fig . 2 ), indicating that the two monomers are held together by disulfide bonds . We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the functional protein is embedded in the lipid envelope as a multimeric structure, e .g ., a tetramer, which is dissociated into dimers upon detergent treatment and/or sucrose gradient centrifugation . For the G-protein of vesicular stomatitis virus it has been reported that gradient centrifugation results in the dissociation of the trimeric glycoprotein into monomers (Doms et al ., 1987) .",

            "text": "Of the two functions which have been assigned to the HE-protein (hemagglutinin and esterase) the esterase could be detected easily in the purified protein . The acetylesterase activity was evident both in the color test with the synthetic substrate PNPA (Fig . 4) and in the ability of HE to inactivate the erythrocyte receptors for BCV, HEV, and influenza Cvirus (Table 1 ) . The hemagglutinin function of HE could not be demonstrated with the purified glycoprotein . However, HE was still able to recognize Neu5,9Ac z containing receptors as indicated by the binding-assay with rat serum proteins (Fig . 7) and bythe low hemagglutination-inhibition activity of the purified glycoprotein (Table 2 ) . This interaction was, however, not sufficient for agglutination of erythrocytes . This situation is reminiscent of influenza C virus, the purified glycoprotein (HEF) of which also has esterase and hemagglutination-inhibition but no hemagglutinating activity (Herrler et al., 1 988a) . The purified hemagglutinin of influenza A viruses, on the other hand, has been shown to form rosettes which are able to agglutinate red blood cells (Laver and Valentine, 1969) . The failure of purified HE protein to cause hemagglutination is not due to a lack of rosette formation (Fig . 6) . The receptor-destroying activity of HE counteracts the receptor-binding activity . This is evident from the result of the solid phase binding assay . Binding of BCV-HE was found to be more efficient after inactivation of the esterase by DFP (Fig . 7) . The binding assay has not been applied to HEV-HE, but because of the similarity of both HE proteins in other tests (see Figs . 1-5 and Tables 1 and 2) it is likely that the results obtained with BCV-HE are also valid for HEV-HE . DFP-treated HE was still unable to agglutinate red blood cells . There was, however, some interaction between erythrocytes and the purified coronavirus glycoprotein . Erythrocytes incubated with DFPtreated HE did not pour, when the microtiter plate was placed in a semivertical position (not shown), which is in contrast to control cells . The lack of HA activity in the purified HE protein might be due to a conformational change during the purification procedure, which affects the receptor-binding activity more than the receptor-destroying activity . Another possibility is that the individual glycoproteins have only a low affinity for Neu5,9Ac z containing receptors . In this case the multivalent attachment of HE-proteins present in the viral membrane may increase the binding activity and enable agglutination of erythrocytes . In any case, the purified acetylesterases of BCV and HEV are useful analytical tools to study the importance of Neu5,9Ac z in general, and specifically the cellular receptors for coronaviruses .",
