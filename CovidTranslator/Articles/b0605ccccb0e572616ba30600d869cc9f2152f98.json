Our data suggest that the duty to care must be placed in a wider context to include considerations that transcend individual provider obligations. It thus follows, based on our data, that the duty to care cannot be left to personal choice or an appeal to morality based on an ethic derived entirely from individual obligations.",

In particular, the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) presented circumstances that were propitious for reconsidering this issue, namely the reluctance of some HCPs to care for patients suspected of infection by this unknown pathogen. While some simply refused to work, others seriously questioned the nature of their duty in light of unknown and unquantifiable risk to themselves and their families.",

In turn, SARS fundamentally changed our assumptions about duty and risk-assumptions that had informed the debate on the duty to care in the early years of HIV/AIDS (Reid, 2005) . Ruderman and colleagues called for an honest and critical examination of the role of HCPs during outbreaks in order to provide guidelines regarding professional rights and responsibilities as well as ethical duties and obligations (Ruderman et al., 2006) . A social dialogue to advance the public debate on this increasingly urgent issue was needed.",

The analysis was organized into three phases: open, axial, and selective coding (Yin, 1994) . In open coding, transcripts were read multiple times and then fractured by identifying units of text relating to a concept or idea. In axial coding, ideas were compared for consistency both within and between transcripts with the intention of organizing similar ideas into overarching themes or conceptual categories which are then further developed by iteration in order to eliminate redundancy and ensure that categories are comprehensive. In selective coding, core concepts were identified as central themes of the study and conceptual categories were organized in relation to these concepts.",

This goes against popular and published discourse that advocates that limits to the duty to care is a personal choice and thus decisions about whether or not to provide care should be relegated to the private realm. However, most participants placed great value on the set of institutional and societal conditions that should be in place for HCPs to fulfill their duty to care. The strength of our study derives from the recognition of the need to incorporate contextual considerations into parameters defining duties and obligations. Our framework incorporating micro-(scope of obligations of HCPs), meso-(institutional), and macro-(societal) considerations flows directly from our findings that institutional and societal considerations formed a fundamental part of participants' understanding of HCPs' duty to care during outbreaks. While at the micro-level, participants often vacillated when they expressed their views, in effect reflecting an ambivalence inherent in historical understandings of duty to care, there was greater certainty when it came to meso-(institutional) and macro-(societal) considerations. For example, many participants posited that HCPs have a duty to demand protection from their respective institution and further established a reciprocal relationship between this duty and the duty of institutions to protect HCPs as well as distribute risk and mitigate tension among providers. Participants paid a great deal of attention to the broader social context, with societal considerations playing a crucial role in promoting dialogue and education as well as providing compensation.

We found that the majority of HCPs do not necessarily accept the notion that they have an unconditional duty to care for patients during outbreaks. A recent study of family physicians found a willingness to provide care in the context of a pandemic and risk to self; however, there is a lack of certainty as to where legitimate limits are drawn (Morin, Higginson, & Goldrich, 2006) . Arguments in favour of a limited duty to care do not provide specific guidance as to what constitutes risk, what and how much risk is acceptable or is expected to be undertaken.",

Numerous scholars have examined the historical basis of how HCPs had responded throughout historic plagues to explore how responses to past epidemics could be applied to present circumstances (Angoff, 1991; Emanuel, 2003; Fox, 1988 Fox, , 1989 Friedlander, 1990; Geraghty & Wynia, 2000; Ha & Cohen, 1991; Huber & Wynia, 2004; Loewy, 1988; Sharp, 1988; Sheldon, 1990; Zuger & Miles, 1987) . However, most concluded that it is difficult to employ history as a basis for the claim that physicians have a duty to care because historical traditions of the profession in this regard are not consistent, rendering it impossible to make generalizations and thus providing little, if any, guidance on what HCPs ought to do today.",

However, the breadth of grounds upon which such claims have been made is not as wide as the diversity of claims would suggest. In general, all of these arguments treat the question of the duty to care within a single paradigm usually defined within the confines of an individualized duty to care-and thus neglect contextual and extrinsic considerations relevant to and necessary for satisfying this duty, especially during outbreaks. While most scholars who have explored the nature of the duty to care offer compelling arguments to justify the ethical duty to care, many of them ground it in an ''irreducibly individual obligation'' (Tomlinson, 2004) . This might be explained by the fact that the deontological nature of the notion of duty naturally leads to an exploration of the duty to care in such deontological, i.e. inherently individualist, terms. It can also be explained by the fact that discussions on the duty to care have been explored in the context of a biomedical framework focusing on the patientphysician relationship.",

As our study illustrates, the broader institutional and societal context must be taken into account. It thus follows based on our findings that the limits to the duty to care cannot be left simply to personal choice or an appeal to morality that emerges from an individualized notion of caring. Moreover, the relevance of these considerations does not lie in the distinction between the micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of analysis but in the interplay and the linkages between them; HCPs cannot adequately fulfill their duty to care without institutional and societal support. The nature of the duty to care ought to be weaved within the fabric of society in order to provide HCPs with the conditions and resources necessary to satisfy their duty, rather than based on an ethic derived entirely from individual obligations.",

However, the purpose of qualitative inquiry is to describe the range of views of study participants. While this project was born out of the SARS experience in Toronto, discussions with participants revolved around communicable diseases outbreaks in general and were not limited to mainly SARSimpacted institutions. As well, we conducted our research against the backdrop of the threat of a pandemic influenza; this prospect, and the wide media coverage it has received, informed participants' views. Moreover, many participants drew on their past experiences during outbreaks of polio, tuberculosis, and malaria. As such, we believe that the findings of our research are directly applicable to the current debate on pandemic influenza preparedness and other newly emerging communicable diseases, such as extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), a newly identified TB threat which leaves patients (including many people living with HIV) virtually untreatable using currently available anti-TB drugs.",
