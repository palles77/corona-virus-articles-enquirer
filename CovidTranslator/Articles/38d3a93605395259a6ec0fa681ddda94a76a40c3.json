In all these methods the main step is the observation in an electron microscope of the interaction between viruses and their antibodies. This procedure permits, therefore, not only the direct visual recognition of the virion by its morphology but it also permits a specific identification of the virus via the antibody reacting with the virus. This combination of immunological and morphological method has an advantage over the other methods, where immunological reactions provide only a clue to the identity of the virus.",

The popularity of this method increased when Brenner and Horne (1959) introduced the simple principle of negative staining. In 1969 Almeida and Waterson (1969a) showed how agglutination of viruses by their antibodies could be demonstrated in the electron microscope and be used in the specific diagnosis of the virus. They called this phenomenon \"Clumping.\" Milne and Luisoni (1975) showed the possibility of specific viral diagnosis based on the halo that antibodies formed around individual viruses or clumps of viruses and called this type of reaction \"Decoration.\" These two main methods were employed in a number of variations: Optimal conditions for the reactions were found by varying the relative concentrations of virions and antibodies and by removing impurities from the reaction mixture either by centrifugation or by deposition of the complexes on agar (Kelen et al., 1971; Anderson and Doane, 1973) . These methods permitted the detection and identification of the viruses of rubella, corona, rhino, hepatitis A and B, rota, adeno, Norwalk, papilloma, etc. (Best et al., 1967; Pensaert et al., 1981; Kapikian et al., 1972a,b; Feiastone et al., 1973; Almeida et al., 1971; Flewett and Boxall, 1976; Almeida and Waterson, 1969a) .",

Since Derrick's method resembles solid phase immunoassays such as SPRIA (Catt, 1969) and ELISA (Engvall and Perlmann, 1971) , it has been suggested that his method be called immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) (Roberts et al., 1982) . In our opinion, Roberts' definition of ISEM is too narrow and should include not only methods with antibody-coated grids, but all other methods where a solid absorbent participates in the antibody-virus interaction, like the method of Milne and Luisoni (1975) , where the virus is absorbed on the grid, or our own method in which the virus is absorbed to antibody-coated Staphylococcus aureus.",

The grids were then washed to remove residual unattached antibodies and incubated for 1 hour with homologous and heterologous viruses derived from crude leaf extracts. Free viruses, as well as impurities, were washed off. The grids were dried and shadowed with metals. It was shown that 40 to 50 times more TMV particles were \"trapped\" on anti-TMV coated grids as compared to anti-PVY coated grids, while PVY was trapped 20 times more efficiently on anti-PVY coated grids than on anti-TMV coated grids. This AB-CGT was also shown to be suitable for quantitation, since the log of the number of virus particles specifically absorbed to grids decreased linearly with the virus dilution.

They preferred this negative staining upon the positive staining, obtained with ethanolic uranyl acetate that was used by Derrick and Brlansky (1976) . With the negative staining technique, better resolution was obtained and the viral capsids were well preserved, though better contrast was obtained by positive staining. Another modification proposed was an improved way for preparing and storing antiserum-coated grids. In this procedure, grids were adsorbed with antiserum, washed with PB and water, and then dried and stored (temperature not stated). Before use, the grids were wetted with PB, drained, and incubated with the virus. Results were only slightly better with \"fresh\" as compared to the stored grids.",

A virus was considered specifically trapped only if it was also \"decorated\" by the second layer of antibodies. In the authors' view, decoration is the best proof for a specific immune reaction, since with all other methods, clumping or trapping may occur nonspecifically, due to factors not entirely understood. Milne and Lesemann (1978) confirmed the data of Derrick (1973) and Derrick and Brlansky (1976) that larger numbers of viruses were trapped on antibody-coated grids than on untreated grids or on control grids treated with normal serum. However, in disagreement with Derrick and Brlansky, Milne and Lesemann stated that in order to obtain maximal trapping, optimal dilutions of sera had to be used. The most effective dilutions were between 1 : 800 and 1 : 3200. At low dilutions of serum an inhibition of trapping occurred due to serum proteins competing with the antibodies for sites on the grid. This assumption was elegantly confirmed The addition of increasing amounts of normal serum or bovine serum albumin (BSA) to an antiserum diluted 1 : 600 progressively inhibited the trapping of the homologous viral particles. Roberts and Harrison (1979) used the AB-CGT for the detection of potato leafroll and potato mop-top viruses (PLRV and PMTV, respectively). The grids freshly coated with carbon only were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C with diluted antiserum (dilution 1:lOOO in PB pH 6.5),",

To confirm the specificity of the AB-CGT, viruses bound to the grids were incubated on drops of antibody for 1 to 3 hours at room temperature, stained, and observed for antibody coating (\"decoration\"). The AB-CGT of Roberts and Harrison thus enables examinations and measurements of fragile viruses (PMTV) which are found in low amounts in fresh leaf extracts, without the need of purification and centrifugation steps. studied various parameters of the AB-CGT which influence specific (serological) and nonspecific binding of tymovirus particles to electron microscope grids. Carbon -Formvar-coated grids were treated by the glow discharge procedure, and floated for 5 minutes on antiserum, normal serum, or buffer (PB). Grids were then washed with PB and floated for 15 minutes on virus drops. Nontrapped viruses were washed away with water. The grids were then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. With this procedure, purified viruses adsorbed to buffertreated grids to the same degree as to antibody-coated grids. Different viruses exhibited different degrees of nonspecific binding.

In their optimal procedure they incubated for 5 minutes a drop of 1 : 500 dilution of rabbit antiserum, on a Formvar-carbon-coated grid. After washing with PB saline (PBS) a drop of virus was incubated on the grid for 15 minutes, washed again, and incubated for decoration with a drop of an 1:2500 antiserum dilution. After a fixation step by 0.8% glutaraldehyde the grid was again washed with PBS and water and stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by cross experiments with polyoma virus. Similar number of viruses were trapped with a wide range of capture-antibody dilutions (1 : 500 to 1 : 10,000). The decoration step facilitated viewing of the virions. Antibody-coated grids trapped 17 to 28 more viruses as compared to untreated grids. As few as lo2 to lo3 plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml) were detected specifically within 1 hour. The method is regarded by the authors as rapid, sensitive, and specific and is recommended for the detection of viruses in clinical specimens. Rubinstein and Miller (1982) compared as ELISA method to an EM procedure and to the AB-CGT for the detection of rotaviruses. In their AB-CGT, Formvarcarbon-backed grids were incubated for 15 minutes on drops of antiserum diluted 1 : 2000 in PBS, washed on three drops of PBS, further incubated for 15 minutes on virus drops, and washed again. Negative staining was done with 2% phosphotungstic acid. The ELISA and AB-CGT were equally sensitive while the classical EM procedure was at least 9 times less sensitive. It was estimated that the ELISA and AB-CGT were able to detect approximately lo6 simian rotavirions and lo' particles of human rotavirions. Out of 455 clinical specimens (stools from children with diarrheal diseases) 197 were positive by the AB-CGT while 193 of the 197 were also positive by ELISA. Of the 258 negative samples by the AB-CGT, 238 were negative by ELISA. For 18 specimens that were positive by ELISA and negative by the AB-CGT a confirmatory blocking test showed that all of them were \"true\" positives. The failure to detect the viruses in the ELISA positive samples by the AB-CGT can be partially explained by the presence of viral debris which may block the adsorption of intact particles to the antibody-coated grids. However, a few samples that were positive by the AB-CGT were negative by ELISA. The reason for this phenomenon is not quite understood.",

High antiserum concentrations were inhibitory, although somewhat less in the PA-CGT than in the AB-CGT. Protein A treatment of grids did not lead to a dramatic increase of the number of virions trapped over grids treated with antiserum alone. At optimal conditions for both techniques, PA-CGT trapped only 2 to 3 times more virions than the AB-CGT. However, at low virus concentrations similar numbers of virions were trapped on antiserum coated grids with or without protein A. Protein A may thus be of advantage in cases where the number of antibodies is a limiting factor but not when the numer of virions is limited. Lesemann and Paul (1980) studied the effect of various conditions for the use of protein A in the PA-CGT and compared the results with the AB-CGT. They used pioloform-carbon-coated grids after exposure to glow discharge. The grids were floated for 5 minutes on drops of protein A (10 pg/ml or more) diluted in PB, washed with 20 drops of PB, drained on filter paper, and floated again for 5 minutes on drops of diluted antiserum or normal serum. After washing with 20 drops of PB, the grids were transferred for 15 minutes onto drops of virus. The grids were then washed with 40 drops of water and stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate.

In their opinion the main advantage of the protein A in the PA-CGT is that it allows the use of sera at high concentrations which are inhibitory in the AB-CGT. The use of higher antiserum concentrations enhances trapping capacity of the grids. Under these conditions six times more particles (from high virus concentrations) were trapped in the PA-CGT as compared to the number trapped in an optimized AB-CGT. Other advantages of using high serum concentrations in the PA-CGT are (1) nonspecific binding on normal serum coated grids is depressed; (2) low titered antisera can be used; and (3) high concentration of antibody on the grid permits the detection of weak heterologous reactions. However, when the trapping efficiency of the two tests was compared under conditions where the virus was present at low concentrations the PA-CGT did not show any advantage over the AB-CGT (see also Milne, 1980) . Two explanations were proposed for these results: (1) that not all of the immunoglobulins are absorbed (like IgM) on protein A-coated grids, and thereby some antibody activity is lost; and (2) grids coated with diluted antiserum alone are not completely covered and some of the virions attach nonspecifically . Nicolaieff et al. (1980) used the PA-CGT for the trapping of animal viruses such as rotaviruses. In their study the virus specimens were fecal extracts from infants suffering from diarrhea. The grids were first coated by flotation on 50 p1 drops of 25pg/ml of protein A for 4 minutes, and after transfer through drops of PB the grids were floated on 50 pl drops of 1 : 500 diluted antiserum (10 minutes), followed by rinsing in PB. Such grids were put overnight on drops of stool extracts diluted in PB. The grids were then washed in distilled water and stained with 1% uranyl acetate in 45% ethanol for 2 minutes.",

Though PA-CGT and ELISA were equally sensitive, ELISA lends itself better to mass screening than electron microscopy. In one microplate up to 22 crude fecal extracts can be set up, and several specimens may be examined in a single test, whereas in electron microscopy each specimen has to be observed separately; therefore assuming even that the time allowed for one specimen is 4 -5 minutes, it would require about 2 hours to achieve a result equivalent to 1 -2 minutes reading time of ELISA.",

The grids were then washed with 20 drops of PB and with 50 drops of distilled water and finally stained with 2% of aqueous uranyl acetate. Some viral suspensions were either purified preparations in dilute buffer, or preparations from CsCl or sucrose bands. Others were infected leaf extracts. The washing steps which were essential to remove efficiently salts, sugars, and many impurities did not detach the viruses. Once a homologous antiserum was used, the interaction with the virus was evident as a halo of antibodies surrounding the virus. All the viruses tested (TMV, TRV (tobacco rattle virus), CVMV (carnation vein mottle virus), TBSV, and CMV remained intact after the AG-CGT except for MRDV (maize rough dwarf virus), For this virus a fixation step with 2% glutaraldehyde was included before washing and proceeding to the antiserum coating step. In the same paper a short timedclumpingmethod was compared to the AG-CGT. The authors conclude that whenever adequate numbers of viruses are present, the AG-CGT is preferable because it is quick and simple: when the virus concentration is low, either the AB-CGT (Derrick, 1973) or the \"clumping method'' (Milne and Luisoni, 1977a) should be used.",

At optimal conditions they give highly specific and reproducible results, and their sensitivity is similar to that of the \"classical IEM methods\" that were based on the phenomenon of clumping (Almeida and Waterson, 1969b) . The AB-CGT method is attractive also because there is no need to purify the samples examined, and because it permits good identification of virions present in crude extracts of infected secretions or excretions. This fact is emphasized by Narang and Codd (1981) who studied acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis: differential centrifugation of fecal samples actually led to loss of some viral flora. While in untreated fecal samples examined by direct EM methods adenovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, and \"small round\" viruses were seen, in the centrifuged samples some of these viruses were lost, most probably because some viruses, already clumped by indigenous antibodies in faeces, are removed by centrifugation. The presence of such clumps may be mistakenly interpreted as due to the effects of specific immune serum added during the process of preparation of the sample for IEM.",

Each laboratory should, therefore, test the grids and their coating for the particular system and viruses which it is investigating. The same consideration also applies to staining: one stain may be suitable for one group of viruses, but deletorious to another (Roberts and Harrison, 1979) .",

Coating of grids with protein A subsequently permits use of a wider range of dilutions of the antiserum, and the inhibition of binding with undiluted serum is avoided. Because of that, one may safely use undiluted sera of low titer. The number of virions trapped on protein A-antiserum-coated grids is greater than that with the AB-CGT by a factor of least 2 (Milne, 1980) , provided that the tests are done each at its optimal performance. With samples with small number of virions both methods were similar in their trapping efficiency.",

In our experience with Sindbis virus, the specificity of PA-CGT was equally high with or without decoration, presumably because of the use of BSA in the buffer.

The sensitivity of the methods is expressed either as limiting ng/ml or as the number of infective units of virus (e.g., PFU/ml). ELISA is able to detect a few ng/ml of viral protein which is equivalent to lo7-lo8 virions. Katz et al. (1980) found that the limit of detection of Sindbis virus with PA-CBT is lo6-lo6 PFU/ml, while Giraldo et al. (1982) , working with papova viruses, set the limit lo2-lo3 PFU/ml. As long as the exact number of virions necessary for 1 PFU is not determined it is very misleading to compare various methods using PFU as a criterion. In respect to the Sindbis virus 1 PFeT contains approximately 30 virions (A. Shapira and S. Lustig, personal communication). Therefore, the limiting detectable number of Sindbis virions by the PA-CGT would be 3 X lo7. As to the data of Giraldo et al. (1982) concerningpapovavirus we do not know how many virions there are in 1 PFU, and therefore it is impossible to state whether his method is more or less sensitive.",

We assume that this state of affairs is due to the historical fact that the ISEM methods were primarily developed by plant virologists and the transfer of methodology from the plant virus field to that of animal viruses might take some time. In distinction from animal viruses which are present only in scant numbers in body fluids and excretions, plant viruses are quite abundant in the tissues of infected plants, and their concentrations there may reach values as high as 1 mg/ml . The finding and identification of plant viruses by EM is thus much easier than that of animal viruses. It is therefore understandable that quite a considerable effort has yet to be invested in the optimization of the ISEM methods for the diagnosis of animal viruses.",

(1981) suggest using commercial pools of y-globulin as clumping antibodies, since such pools contain antibodies to a large number of common animal viruses. Such pools would thus be very useful to pick up from feces not only rotaviruses but other viruses such as astrovirus, adenovirus, and calicivirus. Berthiaume's method can be hopefully applied to the PA-CGT, as well as to other ISEM methods.",
