Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation.",

The normal birth rate and mortality during the study period are not considered; 2. The influence of external factors on the model parameters is ignored; 3. The transmission method is person-to-person. The model divides the total population into four categories: susceptible populations (S, not yet infected but at risk of being infected), latent or exposed people (E, including people with mild or asymptomatic but infectious populations), Infected (I, confirmed to be infectious) and removed (R, including those who have been cured and died from neocoronavirus infection). The first case of New Coronavirus infection was found on December 8, 2019. The average incubation period of New Coronavirus infection was 7 days, so this article believes that the first patient infected with New Coronavirus may already exist on December 1, 2019. It has not been diagnosed yet, this article classifies those who have been infected with the new coronavirus but are not diagnosed as latent people; when the latent people are diagnosed as infected people, they will be treated in isolation in the hospital, then I think the infected people will no longer have the possibility of infecting others.

            "text": "This article uses Wuhan as the main body of the simulation. The outbreak of the new crown virus infection is just before and after the Chinese Spring Festival. As of January 23, 2020, about 5 million people have flowed out of Wuhan. According to the 2018 statistical yearbook, the population of Wuhan is about 11.08 million. Therefore, this article assumes N = 6080000; if a susceptible person (S) comes in contact with a latent person (E) within a unit time, the susceptible person may be infected with the probability of infection and become a carrier (E). According to According to official reports, 1% to 5% of close contacts are diagnosed as infected, so the probability of contact between a susceptible population and a latent person is 1% to 5%. In this paper, 5% is selected as the infection probability b. The average daily number of close contacts of the latent person is k = 5, so the probability of infection \u03b2 is 0.25; each exposed person (E) is transformed into the infected person (I) at a conversion rate \u03b1 , and the incubation period refers to the time from infection to clinical symptoms of the disease. Covid-19 is currently estimated to have an incubation period of 1 to 12.5 days and a median of 5 to 6 days. According to information on other coronavirus diseases such as MERS and SARS, the incubation period for Covid-19 may be as long as 14 days. WHO recommends 14-day follow-up of contacts in confirmed cases. This article assumes that the incubation period is a maximum of 7 days.",

About 30% went to provinces, municipalities and municipalities across the country, which made it difficult for the infected people to trace back to the population. Except for Hubei Province, the newly confirmed cases in other parts of the country are generally stable, with a low case fatality rate of about 2% to 3%. The National Health and Health Commission has incorporated new coronavirus infection into Class B infectious diseases and adopted Class A prevention and control measures.The source of the new coronavirus has not been determined so far. Various evidences show that the source of the infection of the new coronavirus comes from wild animals. It is most similar to a coronavirus isolated from bats. The intermediate host may be pangolin, but which kind of wild animal uncertain. The new coronavirus causes human-to-human transmission mainly by respiratory droplets, causing fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is also infectious during the incubation period. In conclusion, considering transmissibility and fatality rate, 2019-nCoV poses a major public health threat, at least at the level of 2003 SARS 2 . A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5 3 Li et al. Analyzed and predicted information such as demographic characteristics and patient exposure history. The estimated basic regeneration number R0 was 2.2 (95%CI,1.4 to 3.9), and the incubation period was 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 7). The number of confirmed cases doubles approximately every 7.4 days, and the interval from case onset to hospitalization and cure is 9.1 days (95% CI, 8.6-9.7) 4 . Shi Zhao et al. Estimated that the average basic regeneration number R0 ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96 to 2.55) cases Days (95% CI, 5.8 to 7.1) doubled 6 . Xiong et al.
