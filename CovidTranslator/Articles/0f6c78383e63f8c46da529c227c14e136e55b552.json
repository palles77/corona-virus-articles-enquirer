            "text": "Bacteriophage T7 infection has been studied in Escherichia coli strains showing both increased and decreased ribosome fidelity and in the presence of streptomycin, which stimulates translational misreading, in an effort to determine effects on the apparent programmed translational frameshift that occurs during synthesis of the gene 10 capsid protein. Quantitation of the protein bands from SDS-PAGE failed to detect any significant effects on the amounts of the shifted 10B protein relative to the in-flame 10A protein under all fidelity conditions tested. However, any changes in fidelity conditions led to inhibition of phage morphogenesis in single-step growth experiments, which could not be accounted for by reduced amounts of phage protein synthesis, nor, at least in the case of decreased accuracy, by reduced amounts of phage DNA synthesis. Reduction in phage DNA synthesis did appear to account for a substantial proportion of the reduction in phage yield seen under conditions of increased accuracy. Similar effects of varying ribosomal fidelity on growth were also seen with phage T3, and to a lesser extent with phage T4. The absence of change in the high-frequency T7 gene 10 frameshift differs from earlier reports that ribosomal fidelity affects tow-frequency frameshift errors.",

The addition of streptomycin, which stimulates translational misreading, increased frameshifling in Sm r strains, as did the introduction of a ram (ribosomal ambiguity) mutation (rpsD, ribosomal protein $4 of the 30S subunit) into a host containing a highly restrictive rpsL allele (Atkins et al. 1972) . Additional studies with rpsL mutants have shown a reduction in the variety of translation-specific errors in vivo and in vitro (as reviewed in Gorini 1974 ; and more recently Parker 1989) . The increased accuracy phenotype of rpsL mutants has been attributed to an increased efficiency of translationalproofreading, compared to wild-type (wt) ribosomes ; rpsD mutants with the ram phenotype exhibit decreased translational accuracy or increased misreading, similar to the effect of addition of streptomycin to wt ribosomes. In vitro experiments suggest that rpsD ribosomes are inefficient in translational proofreading (Andersson and Kurland 1983) and it has been suggested that streptomycin similarly causes misreading with wt ribosomes by reducing the efficiency of translational proofreading .",

Furthermore, in our hands, the arg auxotrophy in strain XAc could be suppressed by the rpsD14 allele; this auxotrophy could also be phenotypically suppressed by addition of streptomycin, but not in the presence of the rpsL1204 allele. Strain 011' was used as a standard host for growth of T7 wt phage and T7 gene 9am17 (amber 17 in gene 9) phage stocks. Strain B401 (amber Su +) was the host for growth ofT7 gene lOam13 (amber 13 in gene I0) phage stocks. Strain XAc was used as the standard host for growing phage stocks of wt T3 and T4. Preparation of phage stocks was similar to that described for other phage (Goldman and Lodish 1973) . T-broth (Studier 1969 ; 1% tryptone, 0.5% NaC1) plus M9 supplements (Miller 1972 ) was the standard growth medium for preparation of phage stocks.

Parallel cultures on M9 medium were grown from single colonies. Colonies of the streptomycin-pseudodependent strain, Sm p, were grown as above on M9 plates supplemented with 500 pg/ml dihydrostreptomycin (Sigma). Cultures of the Sm v strain when grown without streptomycin (Sm p without Str), were started from the streptomycin-containing plates; however no streptomycin was added to the broth culture.

Samples were thawed at 37 \u00b0 C, and 15 pl proteinase K (10 mg/ml) was added to give a final concentration of 50 gg/ml. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 90 rain, 0.45 ml aliquots were transferred to 1.5 ml microfuge tubes, mixed with 50 gl 3 M sodium-acetate, pH 6.0, and 0.5 ml isopropanol.

This mixture of enzymes yields a characteristic pattern of seven bands from mature phage T7 DNA and two additional bands from replicating T7 DNA: one representing the concatemer junction and the other a covalently closed hairpin that originates from initiation of asymmetric DNA replication near the right end of the T7 DNA molecule (Chung et al. 1990; J. Dunn, unpublished results) . Samples were digested overnight at 37 \u00b0 C and then treated with pancreatic RNase and RNase T1 (10 gg/ml each for 15 rain) prior to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel.

            "text": "Because T7 gene lOB protein arises by an apparent translational frameshift in the reading of the gene IOA mRNA Sipley et al. 1991; Condron et al. 1991) , we sought to examine the effects of a range of host translational fidelity conditions on the frequency of the frameshift. We utilized a collection of ribosomal fidelity mutants in an F-isogenic background (T7 is a female-specific phage) in combination with streptomycin, an agent known to cause translational misreading. Frameshifting during the course of T7 infection was determined by quantitation of the ratio of gene t0 products expressed during intervals late in T7 infection as revealed by [35S]methionine pulse-labeling and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis. Figures 1 and 2 show time courses of the synthesis of T7 phage proteins during infection under some of the different conditions of translational accuracy that were tested. During infection, T7 gene expression is controlled through ordered and sequential transcription. Three classes of proteins are made; Class I proteins arise from host transcription and include: T7 RNA polymerase, enzymes that inactivate host enzymes, T7 DNA ligase, and other proteins of unknown function. Class II proteins arise from T7 RNA polymerase transcription and encode enzymes required for DNA metabolism, and inactivation of the host RNA polymerase. Class III proteins encode mostly phage structural proteins of which gene 10 is the most abundantly expressed . Figure 1A presents the phage-specific proteins (mostly class III, some class II) produced late in infection of cells containing wt ribosomes, \"hyperaccurate\" streptomycin-pseudodependent ribosomes without streptomycin (Sin p without Str), and \"inaccurate\" ram ribosomes. The outer lane (gene 10 amber), which lacks the gene IOA and 10B proteins, serves as an aid to help identify the individual IOA and B bands in the other lanes (the band immediately above 10B is a host band which is labeled due to incomplete shutoff of host protein synthesis; see Fig. 2 ). As indicated, the gene 9 protein is the major band migrating between the IOA and 10B proteins under these conditions of electrophoresis. In an effort to facilitate quantitation of 10B relative to IOA, a T7 gene 9 amber mutant was utilized in these experiments to minimize incorporation of label into protein migrating in the IOA region of the gel. However, the same results were also obtained with wild-type T7 (data not shown). Overall the amount and kinetics of synthesis of the late T7 proteins are similar in the wt and ram strains; the levels of 10B and IOA expression also appear proportional. However in the Sm p strain, total incorporation of label is noticeably reduced, and synthesis of T7 late proteins appears delayed; in some experiments, proteins characteristic of earlier timepoints are still apparent at later timepoints (e.g., gene 2.5 in Fig. 2) . Quantitation of the frameshift ratio expressed as [IOB/(IOB+IOA)] x 100, of each lane of the gel is presented in Fig. 1 B. No significant difference in the amount of frameshifting among the three strains was apparent. Figure 2 shows the complete time course of infection of the Smp strain with and without streptomycin.

T7 wt phage morphogenesis was monitored concurrently with SDS-PAGE analyses of different translational fidelity conditions similar to those presented in Figs. 1 and 2 . Cultures were infected with wt T7 and periodic samples of the infected cultures were removed and treated with CHC13, lysozyme (50 gg/ml), and 10 mM EDTA. The samples were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 2 min and serial dilutions of the supernatant were assayed for plaque-forming units on a lawn of XAc (wt ribosomes). Each infected culture was also monitored for \"half-lysis time,\" which is defined as the time in minutes for the turbidity (measured in a Klett-Summerson colorimeter) to decrease by half following addition of phage to the culture. Half-lysis times obtained for each condition were: wt, 17 rain; wt+l.5 gg/ml Str, 27 min; ram, 25 min; Sm p, 43 min; Sm \u00b0 + 200 gg/ml Str, 17 rain Cells were grown at 37 \u00b0 C in M9 to 2 \u00d7 10S/ml and infected with T7 at a multiplicity of 5. After 40 min, the cultures were treated with CHC13, and centrifuged. These lysates were used to infect a standard wt strain (XAc) by adding 0.5 ml of lysate to 2 ml of culture. Five minutes later, portions of the culture were subjected to serial dilutions on ice, and the titres of the cells determined on agar plates. The percent survivors refers to the cell titre obtained after adding the indicated lysate, divided by the titre of parallel uninfected cells, x 100. In another experiment, 100 ml cultures of the three different strains were infected with T7 at a multiplicity of 3, and after 40 min the cultures were subjected to semi-purification procedures for T7 as described in the Materials and methods. These lysates were banded in a CsC1 step-gradient, as described by Studier (1969) . Fractions were collected from each sample, and the A26o/ml determined across the gradient. Data shown are the Az6o/ml of the visible T7 band obtained in the wt lysate, and the comparable A26o/ml obtained in the parallel fractions of the gradients from the other two lysates experiment are presented in the legend to Fig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 3A , wt ribosomes yielded the most viable T7 progeny phage (with a burst size of ~ 20 phage per infected cell in this experiment) and these cultures lysed fastest. Addition of a sublethal amount of streptomycin (Fig. 3 B) to the wt culture markedly inhibited the production of viable progeny phage (burst ~-1 phage per infected cell), despite no evident differences in a corresponding SDS-PAGE analysis (not shown).",

We were surprised that the infection was so inefficient because total protein synthesis, as monitored by [35S]methionine incorporation, is only reduced about 50% in the absence of streptomycin (Figs. 1, 2) , and T7 can even form plaques when this strain is used as indicator. The addition of streptomycin to the Sm p strain increased the level of viable progeny phage by more than an order of magnitude (burst -~ 15 phage per infected cell) and reduced cell lysis time (see legend to Fig. 3 B) . The apparent contradiction between the ability to form plaques on this strain and the reduced yield of particles in the single-step growth experiments may be a consequence of the different conditions for each kind of assay: in the plaque assay, serial dilutions of the phage stock lead to an initial multiplicity on the plate of less than 1 x 10-6, whereas the single step growth experiments used a multiplicity of 3-5. Perhaps the Smp cells, already compromised for growth, are unable to sustain productive phage infection under the stress of the higher multiplicity of infection.",

As T7 replicates it forms concatemers, i.e., long molecules containing tandemly repeated T7 genomes joined in a head to tail arrangement through a shared copy of a 160 bp long terminal repeat. The concatemer is thought to provide an intermediate through which the 3' ends of the T7 DNA can be replicated. The concatemers are then processed into unit length molecules, and the terminal repeat is duplicated, as the DNA is packaged into virions in a reaction that is closely linked to phage morphogenesis . Figure 4 presents the electrophoretic analysis in a 1% agarose gel of a restriction endonuclease digest of total DNA isolated during the course of T7 infection of strains with wt, ram, or Smp ribosomes. The mixture of enzymes used to digest the DNA yields a characteristic pattern of bands from mature T7 DNA and two additional bands from replicating T7 DNA. Particularly notable is the presence in the digests from infected cells of bands from the right and left ends of the mature DNA, which only arise by processing of the concatemer junction. The patterns show clearly that T7 DNA is replicated in both the ram and Sm p strains; however, the Sm p strain shows considerable delay and reduction in the amount of T7 DNA synthesized compared to the wt strain, while the ram strain shows only a slight delay in T7 DNA synthesis. The patterns also indicate that the replicated DNA in the ram and Sm p strains can be packaged as judged by the appearance of mature right-and left-hand end fragments. These results suggest that the reduced progeny phage yield in the ram strain is not caused by a failure to replicate and package T7 DNA. The reduced amount of replicating DNA in the Sm p strain, however, is probably a major contributing factor to the inefficient infection in this strain.",

To assess possible translational effects on phage growth in general with these strains, we carried out single-step growth experiments using T4, a lytic phage unrelated to T7 and T3 (data not shown). The translational effects on progeny phage yield are qualitatively similar to those seen in T7 and T3 infection; however, quantitatively the effects are less significant. The wt strain and streptomycin-pseudodependent strain with 200 gg/ml streptomycin produced a similar burst size of 100 pfu per infected cell. When the streptomycin-pseudodependent strain was grown without streptomycin, the phage yield dropped approximately 2.5-fold (~40 pfu per infected cell). Production of viable progeny phage during T4 infection was most severely reduced in the ram strain which had a burst of about 10 pfu per infected cell, which is approximately 10-fold less than that obtained from cells with wt ribosomes.",

Very similar ratios of 10B to 10A protein were observed in each condition we tested. We would not have expected a complete abolition of frameshifting in the restrictive rpsL mutant due to the fact that certain essential host genes require programmed frameshifts to generate their products; however, at least some reduction in the frequency of frameshifting might have been anticipated, particularly given the fact that these cells are already seriously compromised for growth. The lack of effect of ribosomal fidelity on the high-frequency gene 10 frameshift contrasts with earlier studies on low-frequency shifts (Atkins et al. 1972; Weiss and Gallant 1983) . The fidelity alleles would seem to affect only the very lowfrequency errors in maintenance of the reading frame; on the other hand, the fidelity conditions tested here do not have significant impact on an apparent programmed shift. Similar to our findings, Tsuchihashi (1991) was unable to alter the high-frequency dnaX frameshift by increased ribosomal fidelity. Other workers have also suggested that frameshifting was not affected in streptomycin resistant (Sm r) strains. Parker and Precup (1986) reported the lack of effect of a restrictive rpsL (StrA1) allele on putative frameshifting in phage MS2, and Spanjaard and van Duin (1988) found that high level + 1 frameshifting occurs during translation of an MS2 coat protein/rat interferon protein gene fusion in an Sm r host.

            "text": "Other elements have been identified as controls in high-frequency frameshifting (reviewed in Atkins et al. 1990 ). The most general is a requirement for runs of several identical nucleotides that call for specific \"shifty\" tRNAs, which are capable either of pairing in other reading frames, or non-triplet pairing (as reviewed by Parker 1989) . The amino acid sequence across the gene 10 frameshift site has been determined (Condron et al., 1991) , and it appears that a shifty Phe-tRNA is involved that shifts at a run of four uracil residues. A second element is one that facilitates translational pausing in the region of the string of nucleotides, allowing the shift occur. This element may consist of combinations of the following: a termination codon (Craigen and Caskey 1986; Curran and Yarus 1988; Weiss et al. 1987 Weiss et al. , 1988 , a stem loop structure (Jacks et al. 1988; Brierly et al. 1989; Flower and McHenry 1990; Blinkowa and Walker 1990; Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990; Bredenbeek et al. 1990; Dinman et al. 1991) , a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (Weiss et al. 1988 ), or a \"hungry\" codon specifying a \"rare\" tRNA (Spanjaard and van Duin 1988; Spanjaard et al. 1990; Belcourt and Farabaugh 1990; Xu and Boeke 1990 ). An additional factor has recently been identified by Belcourt and Farabaugh (1990) , who found that frameshifting in the yeast Ty retrotransposon is inhibited if the frameshift site is located too close to the initiation codon. It is not yet known if any additional element (besides the run of uracil residues) is involved in the gene 10 frameshift.",

Examination of the T7 late phage proteins by SDS-PAGE revealed little if any difference between wt and ram strains despite a reduction in yield in the ram strain of viable progeny phage as well as particles capable of killing susceptible cells or banding in CsC1. Similarly, addition of a sublethal amount of streptomycin to cells containing wt ribosomes showed no obvious difference in synthesis of late phage proteins; however, production of viable progeny phage was again greatly reduced. Perhaps this is the result of mistranslation introducing missense amino acid substitutions that cannot be detected by SDS-PAGE; the same explanation could also account for inhibition of growth in the ram strain (see Gorini 1974) .",

The changes, however, did not seem substantial enough to account for the reduction in viable phage yield. Most likely a major constraint on production of T7 phage in the streptomycin-pseudodependent strain involves the observed decrease in the rate of T7 DNA synthesis. Whether the slower kinetics of infection in the Smp strain play a role in the reduction of yield from these infections is not clear; presumably this is a direct result of the property that Sm p ribosomes in the absence of streptomycin are slower in translation . Perhaps slower translation leads to limitation for a specific gene product. If the product were vital in T7 or T3 infection for development of progeny phage, it would most likely be required in stoichiometric amounts and any reduction below a certain threshold level would hinder the infection. Alternatively, T7 and T3 may require the translational \"leakiness\" afforded by wt ribosomes, and it is possible that hyperaccuracy actually prevents flexibility needed for normal morphogenesis.",

Since some viable progeny phage are produced (~ 10-fold less than with wt ribosomes) during T4 infection of the ram strain, one might speculate that this is a consequence of the intrinsic translational inaccuracy of the ram strain but that not all errors in protein synthesis will be deleterious.",

We have also confirmed that a male version of the Smp strain used in this study plaques T7 many orders of magnitude better than the isogenic wt male strain, though still not as well as an F-strain. Furthermore, addition of streptomycin to the Smv male somewhat decreased its ability to plaque T7 (data not shown).
