            "text": "The current consensus view is that a higher hierarchical taxonomy of viruses cannot be established for two reasons. Firstly, viruses appear to be polyphyletic in origin, with several sets of viruses arising by different, independent routes at different times. Secondly, subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different host/vector combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution, with these additional gene modules coming from other viruses or host genetic material. Thus, depending on the gene product used for comparison, different phylogenetic relationships can be deduced. Further virus adaptation can arise by reassortment of segmented genomes, gene duplication, deletions, frameshift mutations, point mutations or de novo development of new gene products from existing, unused reading frames.",

These fourteen orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant viruses) and 48 genera (including 30 genera of plant viruses). This approach confirms the separation of the alphaviruses and flaviviruses into two families, the Togaviridae and Flaviridae, but suggests that several other current taxonomic assignments, such as the pestiviruses, hepatitis C virus, rubiviruses, hepatitis E virus and arteriviruses, may be wrong. The coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders, not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified. In addition, the luteoviruses are split into two families and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears not to be a closterovirus but a new genus of the Potexviridae.",

As a result, the earliest efforts to classify viruses were based on biological properties such as disease symptoms, ecological niches and transmission characteristics (Murphy and Kingsbury, 1990) . By the 1930s, problems were already emerging with reliance on such criteria as it was becoming apparent that, in the same host, different viruses could cause very similar symptoms, while similar strains of the one virus could cause very different symptoms (Matthews, 1991) . Consequently, the need for a unified approach to virus taxonomy and nomenclature was recognized at this time, and some of the early schemes have been reviewed by Matthews (1991) .",

Between 1940 and 1966, various classification schemes were proposed independently by individuals and committees resulting in considerable confusion in the literature (Murphy and Kingsbury, 1990) .

It also reveals that the plant virologists had been reluctant, until recently, to abandon the concept of groups and accept the family and genus concepts so readily developed for viruses infecting other organisms. The fifth ICTV report listed three exceptions that had been accepted by ICTV at that time. These were the members of the Reoviridae (3 genera), Rhabdoviridae (2 genera) and Bunyaviridae (1 genus) that infect plants and which are so obviously similar to the other viruses in these families that infect vertebrates and invertebrates, that their inclusion in these families was inescapable (Matthews, 1991) . As pointed out by Matthews (1985a Matthews ( , 1991 , these developments reinforced the concept of the unity of virology and made it imperative that the current plant virus groups be assigned to families and genera since \"the present situation where some groups are equivalent to families and others to genera has become confusing and anomolous, requiring urgent attention\". This theme was also discussed by Van Regenmortel (1989) , who suggested that the current plant virus groups be considered genera, and by Kingsbury (1987) , who suggested they all be considered families.",

Following an international workshop in Braunschweig, Germany in September 1990, a proposal was developed for the family Potyviridae. At this meeting, the suggestion (Ward and Shukla, 1991) to use coat protein and gene sequence data as the basis for discriminating potyvirus species and strains and for assigning these viruses to four genera (at that time unnamed) was critically examined and compared with other approaches to potyvirus taxonomy. At the end of that meeting, the participants voted to establish the plant virus family, Potyviridae and the three genera equivalent to aphid-(Potyvirus genus), mite-(Ryemovirus genus) and fungus-(Baymovirus) transmitted viruses, with a fourth possible genus, Ipomovirus corresponding to the whitefly-transmitted potyvirus pending confirmation by appropriate sequence data. This proposal has been summarized by Barnett (1991) , was accepted by the Plant Virus Subcommittee of ICTV with minor changes to two of the four suggested genus names, and was approved by the ICTV at their executive committee meeting in Glasgow 1993.",

However, as summarized by Howard (1991) , viruses of the animal Hepadnaviridae family have a significantly smaller genome (3.0-3.3 kb) than the plant viruses, and have already been assigned to two genera, Orthohepadnavirus (human, woodchuck and ground squirrel viruses) and Avihepadnavirus (duck and heron viruses), based on their relative sequence identities and other properties.

The sequence data (Howarth and Goodman, 1986; Stanley et al., 1986) reveals that the subgroup II genome organization resembles that of DNA 1 of the bipartite subgroup III viruses rather than the subgroup I viruses, with the exception of the coat protein, which is more closely related to subgroup I (25 070, particularly the C-terminal-end region) than subgroup III (15 07o). The presence of a bipartite genome, with an extra gene segment which almost doubles the genome coding capacity, as well as the use of a different vector raises the possibility that the subgroup III geminiviruses could alternatively be considered a subfamily of the Geminiviridae or a separate family rather than just a separate genus.",

They referred to this family as the Tricornaviridae, while 1CTV has now named them the Bromoviridae (Martelli, 1992) . These viruses all have three genomic molecules plus an mRNA that codes for the coat protein, packaged in three or four (alfalfa mosaic virus) particles. There is a gradation in morphology from the isometric particles of bromovirus and cucumovirus, through the quasi-isometric and occasionally bacilliform particles of ilarvirus to the bacilliform particles of alfamovirus (see Francki et al., 1991) . Some workers had questioned the inclusion of the alfamoviruses in this family (Van Regenmortel, 1989) presumably because of; (i) the bacilliform particle morphology: (ii) the packaging of the coat protein mRNA in a fourth particle rather than in the third (along with RNA segment 3); (iii) the limited sequence identity in protein 3a, the putative movement protein coded for in the 5' region of RNA 3 (Davies and Symons, 1988) ; and (iv) the absence of sequence identity in the capsid protein coding region at the 3' end of RNA 3 (Dasgupta and Kaesberg, 1982; Davies and Symons, 1988) . It is worth noting, however, that the sequence identities of the bromovirus and cucumovirus coat proteins are also low (Davies and Symons, 1988) , and that the ilarvirus particles are quasi-isometric and occasionally bacilliform. The sequence data for RNA 1 and 2 of alfalfa mosaic virus and brome mosaic virus (Haseioff et al., 1984) shows significant identity, suggesting that they are genera of a single family. The analyses of RNAdependent RNA polymerases (see fig. 1 ) and helicases confirm this close relationship (Gorbalenya and Koonin, I989; Koonin, 1991) .",

The two families of luteoviruses have similar sized genomes (5.5-6.0 kb) with a genome-linked VPg at the 5' ends and probably no poly(A) tail or t-RNA-like structure at their 3' ends (Martin et al., 1990) . In general, the 3' halves of their genomes are similarly organized and code for: the coat protein (22-23 kDa); the VPg (17 kDa; in a different reading frame within the coat protein coding region); and a 50-56 kDa protein that is in the same reading frame as the coat protein (Martin et al., 1990) . However, there are major differences at the 5' half of the genomes of the two luteovirus families. This region of the genome Dolja and Carrington (1992) and Koonin (1991) . codes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in two overlapping open reading frames (ORF) that are translated as a fusion protein by a \"-l\" translational frameshift (Martin et al., 1990) which is similar to the amber mutation readthrough adopted by tombusviruses and carmoviruses. One family, represented by barley yellow dwarf virus, has a short (13 nt) overlap between ORF l and 2 and a polymerase with -30 \u00b0/0 sequence identity to that of the tombusviruses (Koonin, 1991) , carmoviruses and dian-thoviruses (Martin et al., 1990 ) as shown in figure 1. The other luteovirus family, represented by beet western yellows virus and potato leaf roll virus, has an additional ORF (ORF 0) at the extreme 5' end of the genome, a larger (298 or .474 nt respectively) overlap between ORF 1 and 2 and a polymerase (fig. l) that resembles that of the sobemovirus family (Martin et al., 1990; Koonin, 1991) .",

The alternate possibility of assigning the two luteovirus subgroups as members of two subfamilies is less favoured given the major differences in the sequence identities of their RNA polymerases, the most important marker of higher taxonomic relationships. The third possibility of classifying them as genera of the Sobemoviridae and Tombusviridae, respectively, is not favoured given the differences in the 3' halves of their respective genomes. In addition, the tombusviruses, carmoviruses and dianthoviruses lack the VPg present in the paraluteoviruses (see Francki et al., 1991) . The 3' half of the sobemovirus genome is also quite different from that of the ortholuteoviruses, particularly in the location of VPg which is downstream in a second reading frame of the coat protein coding region in luteoviruses (Martin et al., 1990) but upstream of the polymerase in the central region of ORF 2, the major translation product of sobemoviruses (Wu et al., 1987) .",

At this stage, I suggest that the pea enation mosaic subgroup of plant viruses be tentatively classified as a distinct family, the Penamoviridae (table I) given their possession of a bipartite genome (5.7 and -3.7 kb), where the second gene segment contains substantial additional coding capacity.

The genome (4003 nt) for the carmovirus carnation mottle virus codes for three major proteins: a 27-kDa ORF 1 product: a 763-residue ORF 1/ORF 2, amber mutation readthrough product which is the RNA polymerase; and the p38 coat protein. The coat protein is coded by the + I reading frame, overlaps the polymerase by eight nucleotides and is synthesized from one or two encapsidated subgenomic RNA (Guilley et aL, 1985) . The tombusvirus genome is larger in size (4776 nt) with five ORF, but is similarly organized. It also codes for its putative polymerase by readthrough of the ORF 1 (p33) amber terminator to give a p92, ORF 1/ORF 2 polymerase product (Hearne et ak, 1990) . The p41 coat protein ORF 3 of tomato bushy stunt virus is downstream and starts 32 nucleotides after the polymerase terminator. Like the carmovirus coat protein, it is also translated from subgenomic RNA (Hearne et al., 1990) . The tombusvirus genome differs from that of the carmoviruses in having two extra ORF at the 3' end of the genome that are translated in overlapping reading frames to give p19 and p22 products which appeared to be unrelated to other ORF encoded by small RNA viruses (Hearne et al., 1990) .",

These overlap by 7 nucleotides to give an 88-kDa fusion protein. RNA 2 codes for a 35 kDa protein with low sequence identity to the RNA 3a movement protein of bromoviruses (Lommel et aL, 1988) . It has been suggested that this movement protein may be equivalent to the RNA 2 product of pea enation mosaic virus (Demler and de Zoeten, 1991) .",

The sobemovirus genome (4.2kb), like that of the luteoviruses, contains a 5' VPg but no 3' poly(A) tail or tRNA-like structure. It contains 4 ORF spread across 3 reading frames (Wu et al., 1987) . The first ORF codes for a 21-kDa protein and overlaps the large central ORF 2. ORF 2 codes for a 105-kDa product that has similar organization to the VPgprotease-polymerase arrangement of the picornavirus supergroup, although the sequence identity is weak (Wu et al., 1987) . In this respect, it differs significantly from the luteoviruses, which code for their VPg in a second reading frame of the downstream coat protein coding region (Martin et aL, 1990) . Thus, the sobemovirus group appears to be a distinct plant virus family. As mentioned above, the sequence data for the maize chlorotic mottle virus genome suggests that it is a carmovirus, not a possible member of the sobemovirus group as currently classified (see Francki et al., 1991) .",

Subgroup A, represented by apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), has a particle length of 730 nm; subgroup B, represented by sugar beet yellows virus (SBYV), has a particle length of 1250 to 1450 nm; while subgroup C, represented by citrus tristeza virus has a particle length of 1650 to 2000 nm (Bar-Joseph and Murant, 1982) . In the introduction to their sequence paper, Agranovsky et al. (1991) state that the current data on structure and expression of closterovirus genomes indicates that they should be reclassified into three separate virus groups, but do not indicate whether those groups are equivalent to distinct genera or distinct families. The genome of the subgroup A virus ACLSV is 7555 nucleotides long and very different in size, arrangement and sequence identity (German et al., 1990) to the larger genome (approximately 14,000 nucleotides) of the closterovirus subgroup B type member SBYV (Agranovsk'y et aL, 1991) . Their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases fall into different phylogeny groups ( fig. 1 ) as do their coat proteins ( fig. 3 ). Furthermore, the 3' end of the ACLSV genome is polyadenylated, while that of SBYV is not.",

Its genome organization is as similar to the potexviruses and carlaviruses as the bymovirus genome is to the potyviruses and rymoviruses. ACLSV also resembles the potexviruses and carlaviruses in particle size (730 nm by 12 nm).

The solution to this problem is also at hand. The observed amino acid sequence similarities between the non-structural proteins of diverse groups of viruses infecting plants and animals (Ahlquist et al., 1985; Argos et al., 1984; Franssen et al., 1984; Haseloff et al., 1984) led to the observation that many plus-stranded RNA plant viruses could be classified into two major supergroups (Goldbach, 1987; Goldbach and Wellink, 1988; Zimmern, 1987) . The viruses within these supergroups may have a common evolutionary origin and there are some sequence similarities between the two major supergroups. This concept appears to have gained widespread acceptance. It has been further refined by the inclusion of additional viruses (see Dolja and Carrington, 1992) and the establishment of a further supergroup (Habili and Symons, 1989) . It has been referred to, and the figures reproduced, in most major reviews and texts on the subject since.

One theory is that viruses evolved from autonomous, self-replicating host cell molecules such as plasmids or transposons, by acquiring appropriate genes that code for packaging proteins. In prokaryotes, there are strong parallels between some members of the bacteriophage families and bacterial plasmids. The phages contain large dsDNA genomes that, like some plasmids, can exist either in an integrated state in the host chromosome or as an autonomously replicating form. Their evolution as viruses is associated with their capacity to package their genome in virus particles which protect the genetic material while outside the host cell and provide a mechanism for attachment to new host cells and DNA injection. The origin of the bacteriophage coat proteins is not known, but it is interesting to note that they have some similarities in their structure and complex assembly patterns (Georgopoulos et al., 1983 ; Katsura, 1983) with bacterial self assembly proteins such as pilin and flagellin (Uhlin et al., 1985 ; Parge et al., 1987) .",

For exam-pie, the genome of the Ty element in yeast is similar to that of the retroviruses. It is about 5900 nucleotides in length and contains two genes, TYA and TYB. TYA codes for a protein P1, which is analogous to the retroviral gag proteins and assembles into virus-like particles that resemble retrovirus cores ; while TYB codes for the enzyme activities protease, integrase and reverse transcriptase and is analogous to the retroviral pol genes (Kingsman et al., 1991) . The major difference between the retrotransposons and the retroviruses is the absence of an env analogue in Ty, resulting in its inability to bud from infected cells or to bind to and infect new target hosts.",

Its polymerase appeared more closely related to those of the positive strand RNA viruses than the dsRNA viruses and with two out of three algorithms appeared distantly related to potyviruses . Its helicase was also related to those of the positive strand RNA viruses being equidistant from those of the potyviruses on the one hand (although in a different position in the genome) and the flaviviruses, pestiviruses and hepatitis C virus on the other . It also coded for a cysteine-like protease with weak identity to the HC-protease of potyviruses. The major difference between this hypovirulence element and the RNA viruses is its lack of a capsid protein. The distant relationship between this fungal hypovirulence element and potyviruses is intriguing given the belief that potyviruses first arose in fungi (Ward et al., 1994) .",

Many types of uninfected plant cells contain RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Strauss et al., 1990) and the replicase function of many RNA viruses is an ancient evolutionary core feature that predates the cassette assembly process that generated the curent RNA virus groups (Rybicki, 1990) . With regard to the origin of the capsid proteins of the small icosahedral positive strand RNA viruses of plants, insects and animals, it is interesting to note that the plant storage protein phaseolin, which has a packaging function, also has a domain containing the same 8-stranded, antiparallel [3-barrel motif (Lawrence et al., 1990) found in the viral proteins (Harrison, 1990) . Thus it is tempting to speculate that these isometric viruses arose first in plants and then subsequently evolved in insects before being transferred to mammals. Rybicki (1990) has pointed out that the picorna-like viruses of insects differ more than the picornaviruses of mammals, and suggested that the latter may have originated in insects.",

This process would entail: (i) the loss of a bounding membrane that separates the replication of the primitive parasitic cell from that of the host cell, thus prohibiting binary fission which is characteristic of cell division and (ii) the use of host cell protein-synthesizing and metabolic machinery (Matthews, 1991) . There are some problems with this type of explanation for the origin of all viruses (Strauss et al., 1990) but it has been suggested to be a possible mechanism by which the poxviruses arose (Fenner, 1979) . Their very large genome size, their complex structure, the presence of many enzymes within the virus particle and their ability to replicate in the cytoplasm independently of host nuclear functions suggest that these large, enveloped DNA viruses may have arisen from simple cellular parasites (Matthews, 1991) .",

Although not included in the analysis by Koonin (1991) , the arteriviruses have been shown to be more closely related to the coronaviruses than the togaviruses on the basis of genome organization (see Dolja and Carrington, 1992) . According to the fifth report of ICTV, they will almost certainly be reclassified either as a genus of the family Coronaviridae or as a new family Arteriviridae (Strauss, 1991) . Since the spherical particle morphology of the arteriviruses is so different from the other two families in this class, one would predict that the arteriviruses constitute a new family, Arteriviridae, in a new order, order 3, as tentatively suggested in table II. Thus another member of the original Togaviridae family has been reclassified (see Strauss et al., 1990) .",

This separation is supported by the gene organization data (Dolja and Carrington, 1992) , and makes the disintegration of the original Togaviridae family complete (Strauss el aL, 1990) . The Togavh'idae family initially contained four genera, the alphaviruses, the flaviviruses, the rubiviruses and the pestiviruses. Gene sequence data showed that although morphologically similar and arthropodborne, the flaviviruses belonged to a different family, the Flaviviridae (Strauss et al., 1990) .

(1990) and Tordo et ak (1992) . In the fifth report of ICTV it was agreed to combine the three families of monopartite, negative strand viruses, Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae, into the order Mononegavirales as outlined by Pringle (1990) . This is the first classification of order of viruses that has been accepted by ICTV. It was also .suggested that consideration be given to combining the multisegmented negative strand virus families, Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae and Bunyaviridae into a second order (Pringle, 1990 ) that, for consistency, could be called the Multinegavirales. The individual gene segments of the Orthomyx-oviridae can be arranged to match the functions of the ordered gene set in the Paramyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae (Strauss et al., 1990; Tordo et al., 1992) , suggesting that these two orders belong to a single class, the Negavirata, as summarized in table III. Phylogentic analyses of the negative strand virus polymerases confirm these assignments of the negative strand viruses into two orders of a single class (Tordo et al., 1992) . The data further indicate that the pneumovirus, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), appears to be a member of a distinct virus family (Pneumoviridae) in the order Mononegavirales, not the subfamily (Pneumovh'inae) of the Paramyxoviridae as currently classified. There are two genera of plant viruses in the Rhabdoviridae and one genus of plant virus (Tospovirus) in the Bunyaviridae. It has recently been shown that the segmented genome of the tenuivirus family of plant viruses is ambisense and resembles that of the Arenaviridae and Bunyaviridae (Kakutani et al., 1990; Zhu et al., 1991; Takahashi et al., 1993; Hamamatsu et al., 1993) , but is sufficiently different to warrant its classification as a distinct family (Tenuiviridae) in the order Multinegavirales as shown in table III.",

The first subphylum contains the Adenoviridae and the phages PRD1 (TectiviridaeL phi29 (Podoviridae) and M2 (Podoviridae). Their polymerases are proteinprimed DNA polymerases and, are similar to those from bacterial and fungal plasmids supporting their possible evolution from these selfreplicating molecules. The sequence identity between the DNA polymerases of these four families of viruses ( fig. 7) suggests the three phages belong to a different order but probably the same class as the Adenoviridae (table IV) . The analysis also reveals that the phi29, M2 and T7 phages, which are currently classified as members of the same family Podoviridae (Ackermann, 1991a) , have very different DNA polymerases and belong to different families in different phyla (table IV). As discussed above, the name Allopodoviridae is suggested for the phi29/M2 phages family to distinguish them from the well characterized T7 Podoviridae.",

The second is the reluctance to consider higher taxa, given the polyphyletic origin of viruses and the recombinative process of cassette assembly, where gene acquisitions from a variety of sources have accompanied the evolution of different virus families. Both problems can now be approached given the wealth of information that is currently accumulating on virus genome sequences, replication strategies and structural relationships.",

Three plant virus families, Rhabdoviridae, Bunyaviridae and Reoviridae, have been recognized for some time since the plant viruses are obviously members of these accepted larger families that include viruses infecting vertebrates and invertebrates. More recently proposals for the Geminiviridae, the Cryptoviridae, the Bromovh'idae, the Comoviridae, the Tombusviridae, the PotyvMdae and the Sequiviridae have been developed (Martelli, 1992; Mayo et al., 1993) .

Many of these plant virus families contain only one genus but appear to be sufficiently distinct to warrant their classification as separate families. The most contentious conclusions are: (i) the separation of the luteovirus group into two families tentatively named Ortholuteovh'idae and Paraluteoviridae to retain the luteovirus connecting for both families; (ii) the separation of the closteovirus group of filamentous viruses into two families, the Closteroviridae (sugar beet yellows subgroup) and the ACLSV subgroup, whicl~ appears to be a genus of the Potexviridae.

In considering these assignments, one must keep in mind the need to accommodate biological variation in any ordered system of classification. Thus the number of gene segments, the presence of additional unique coding regions and the use of alternate vectors are all properties that can vary between genera of the same family if the gene sequence data shows that most of the other gene products are appropriately related. This is important in the final decision regarding the classification of the subgroup III geminiviruses, the dianthoviruses, the pea enation mosaic virus group, the bymoviruses, the tobamoviruses, the tobraviruses and the hordeiviruses. The classification of the pea enation mosaic virus group as a distinct family rather than a genus of the Ortholuteoviridae and the assignment of the dianthovirus group as a distinct family rather than a genus of the Tombusviridae is based primarily on the presence of a bipartite genome where the second RNA segment has considerable coding capacity. These groups could just as easily be classified as subfamilies of the Ortholuteoviridae and Tombusviridae, respectively. The final decision about the assignment of the tobamovirus, tobravirus and hordeivirus groups of rod-shaped viruses to separate families rather than to subfamilies or genera of a single family will be based on similar arguments given their very similar gene organization, close polymerase sequence identity, 5' capped structure and 3' tRNA-like structures. This raises the question whether the third subgroup of the Geminiviridae, with their additional gene segment (Howarth and Goodman, 1986; Stanley et al., 1986) should also be classified as a distinct family or subfamily rather than a distinct genus.",

The validity of these assignments is strengthened by the observation that the five classes correspond to the supergroups previously recog-nized (Goldbach and Wellink, 1988 ; Habili and Symons, 1989; Strauss et al., 1990; Dolja and Carrington, 1992) and widely accepted by plant and animal virologists.

The original Togaviridae family contained four genera (Alphavirus, Flavivirus, Rubivirus and Pestivirus) but was subsequently split into two families : the Togaviridae (with three genera, Alphavirus, Rubivirus and Arterivirus), and the Flaviviridae (with three genera, Flavivirus, Pestivirus and hepatitis C virus). However the taxonomy indicates that these current assignments are still incomplete as : (i) the rubiviruses appear to belong to a separate family, the Rubiviridae, in a different order but the same class as the Togaviridae, (ii) the pestiviruses and the hepatitis C group are not genera of the Flaviviridae but belong to separate families, the Pestiviridae and Hepciviridae in a separate order but the same class as the Flaviviridae. The taxonomy also accounts for the intended decision to reclassify the arteriviruses as a genus of the Coronaviridae or a new closely related family (Strauss, 1991) , since it shows the Arteriviridae as a distinct family in the same class as the coronaviruses and toroviruses. It also indicates that the toroviruses are not a genus of the Coronaviridae as currently classified, but are a separate family, Toroviridae, in a separate order from the Coronaviridae but the same class as the A rteriviridae.",

The results suggest that, despite the large size and complexity of DNA virus gehomes, the sequences of just the highly conserved DNA polymerase can be used to establish higher order relationships in the same way that the highly conserved ribosomal RNA gene sequences have been used in prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxonomy (Milinkovitch et al., 1993; Stackebrandt, 1994) . The results also indicate that the current taxonomy, where 95 % of the known viruses infecting eubacteria are assigned to one of the three families of tailed bacteriophages (Matthews, 1985a) , is inadequate. The data presented in table IV and figures 6 and 7 suggests there are at least six families of tailed phages in two different phyla.",

As Martelli (1992) points out, there was no follow-through of Francki's proposal, as there was determined opposition among plant virologists to the use of traditional taxonomic systems at that time. Given the present level of information on most families of viruses, it seems overly pessimistic to avoid addressing the question of the higher taxonomy of viruses for fear of not getting it correct at the first attempt. The taxonomies of bacteria, plants, invertebrates and higher animals are constantly being reviewed and adjusted as new data becomes available (Milinkovitch et al., 1993; Stackebrandt, 1994) . As the philosopher Karl Popper advocated, the original approach to scientific investigation of attempting to verify hypotheses formulated from initial observations is inadequate. Popper suggests that one should attempt to disprove one's hypotheses as these refutations, combined with the original theory, will yield a better one (White and Gribbin, 1992) . This was true for influenza virus research where the provocative theory of Fazekas de St Groth (1970 , 1978 , although wrong, precipitated a large international effort that elucidated the molecular basis of antigenic variation in this family of viruses (Ward, 1981 ; Colman and Ward, 1985) . It is also clearly happening in viral taxonomy, where the reassignment of the Togaviridae is but one example. It is hoped that this process will continue as more and more information becomes available for each group of viruses, and that increasing attention will be directed to critically examining the higher order relationships discussed here.",
