Although the two groups of viruses differed markedly in the sequence of the spike protein, the gene (S) encoding this protein showed no evidence of positive selection or of an elevated mutation rate. Rather, the data suggested that recombination events have homogenized the portions of the genome other than the S gene between the two groups of viruses, while continuing to maintain the two distinct, anciently diverged versions of the S gene. The latter hypothesis was supported by a phylogeny of S proteins from representative coronaviruses, in which S proteins of AIBV and TCoV fell in the same clade.",

AIBV causes disease in the upper respiratory tract, but it can also infect other organs such as the kidney and gonads [2] . Turkey coronavirus (TCoV), which causes acute enteric disease in turkeys and consequent economic loss, is closely related to AIBV [6] . Sequence analysis has suggested that recombination may have played a key role in the evolutionary origin of TCoV. Because the spike proteins of TCoV isolates were much more divergent from those of AIBV than were other TCoV proteins, Jackwood and colleagues [7] proposed that TCoV arose through a recombination event involving replacement of the S gene (encoding the spike or S protein) of an AIBV genome with one derived from a more distant, unidentified coronavirus.",

The maximum chi-square method provided support (P \\ 0.0001) for a recombination event in the 3' portion of the b portion of 1ab. Based on the breakpoint estimated by the latter method, a second phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the 3' end of the b portion of 1ab (114 aligned nucleotides), excluding the portion that overlaps the S reading frame (Fig. 1B ). In the latter tree also, the AIBV isolates clustered together and apart from TCoV isolates, although the bootstrap support for the branch separating the major clusters was only 86% (Fig. 1B ). By contrast, in a phylogenetic tree based on the nonoverlapping regions of 1a, the remainder of the b portion, 3a, 3b, and Env sequences, AIBV and TCoV did not form separate clusters (Fig. 2) . Rather, the AIBV genome AY514485 (California 99) clustered within the cluster of TCoV genomes (Fig. 2 ). An internal branch receiving 100% bootstrap support clustered the latter genome with two TCov genomes, GQ427174 and GQ427176 (Fig. 2) . The cluster including AY514485 and all TCoV isolates was separated from all other AIBV isolates by an internal branch that received 100% bootstrap support (Fig. 2) . Thus, the AY514485 genome appeared to represent a recombinant between AIBV and TCoV.

            "text": "Because synonymous mutations are more likely to be neutral, or nearly so, than are nonsynonymous mutations, patterns of synonymous substitutions provide the most reliable index of the mutation rate in protein-coding genes [28] . The present results do not reveal a pattern of synonymous substitution in the S gene indicative of an unusually high mutation rate. In AIBV, mean d S was very similar in the S gene and other genes, while in TCoV, mean d S was actually significantly lower in the S gene than in other genes ( Table 3 ). The fact that neither selection on the spike protein nor a high mutation rate in the S gene can account for the observed results supports the hypothesis that the difference between the S genes and other genes with respect to the extent of divergence between AIBV and TCoV is the result of recombination. In the absence of a high mutation rate, the most reasonable explanation for an unusually high level of synonymous divergence in a given region of two related genomes is that the region in question is more anciently diverged than the remainder of the genome, and that recombination has brought together anciently diverged and more recently diverged genomic segments. However, in the case of AIBV and TCoV, the mechanism involved need not have involved recombination with a distantly related virus [7] . Rather, it is possible that the degree of sequence divergence seen in the S gene has been accumulated since the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of AIBV and TCoV and that the other portions of the genome have been homogenized between these two lineages by repeated events of inter-lineage recombination since the MRCA.",

Similarly, the N gene of the AIBV isolate CK/CH/LSD/05I (EU637854) was less than 1% different from that of the TCoV isolate TCoV/TX-GL/01 (GQ427174) but nearly two orders of magnitude more divergent from a typical AIBV N gene (Fig. 3B) . These results imply that there have been recent recombination events, causing nearhomogenization of certain genomic regions between genomes that continue to differ markedly in the S gene. Moreover, the occurrence of such events suggests an important role for recombination in homogenizing non-S portions of the genome between the AIBV and TCoV lineages.",

The history of these viruses prior to their appearance as agricultural pathogens is unknown, but recent analyses of viruses infecting wild birds suggest that AIBV and TCoV represent just the tip of the iceberg of a vast assemblage of avian coronaviruses awaiting discovery and characterization [29] [30] [31] . Moreover, individual bird species may be infected by a number of distinct coronaviruses [29] [30] [31] , as would be required for recombination between different viral lineages.",
