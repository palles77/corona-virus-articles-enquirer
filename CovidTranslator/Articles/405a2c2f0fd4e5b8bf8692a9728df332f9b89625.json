We have performed molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and principle component analysis (PCA) to investigate the role of the catalytic triad and conformational dynamics of type I and type II of nsp4 PRRSV. The results showed that the RMSF of residues 136-142 near the active site of all models was highly flexible. Moreover, we identified the effect of single structural mutations of the catalytic triad. The percentage of residue with a 0.1 nm RMSF value and PCA results revealed that the mutations affected domain I and II suggesting the wild types were more stable than the mutants. At the catalytic triad, the distances between H39 and S118 were very flexible while the distances between H39 and D64 were very stable. H39, D64 and S118 showed high occupancy percentage of the hydrogen bond interaction with many residues that are conserved in PRRSVAS, PRRSVES, LDVC, LDVP and EAV. Moreover, S118 of wild-type protein formed H-bonds with T134 and G135 but these interactions were lost in PRRSVAV (S118A) and PRRSVES (S117A) indicating that the substitution of important H-bond interaction in PRRSVAS (S118A) and PRRSVES (S117A) affected the flexibility around the catalytic triad, conformation and proteolytic activity. Overall, our study may provide the structural basic of the catalytic triad and be useful for testing the protein activity in future experiments.",

PRRSV is the member of family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales which also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), human coronavirus 229E, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which are similar in terms of structure and genome [1] . Nowadays, PRRSV is characterized into two group namely genotype I (European strain, PRRSVES) and genotype II (North American strain, PRRSVAS) due to the genetic difference which is 60% of nucleotide sequence similarity [2] . PRRSV causes severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory symptoms in all ages of pigs [3, 4] . In addition, this viral infection predisposes pigs to secondary bacterial and viral infections due to immunosuppression induced by this virus [5] [6] [7] . This disease was first discovered in the United States [8, 9] and in Europe [10] and then reported in North American, Europe and Asia simultaneously [11] [12] [13] [14] . At present, decreased pig production caused by PRRSV remains a critically important viral disease in many countries worldwide. Particularly, the emergence of highly virulent PRRSV strains in Asia and Europe threatens the global swine industry [15] [16] [17] .",

The sequence identity between PRRSV and EAV nsp4 is more than 34%, and they share great structural similarity at the tertiary level. Nsp4, the 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP), cleaves nsp3 to nsp12, which is responsible for most of the nonstructural protein processing. The crystal structure of nsp4 [18] shows that nsp4 folds into three domains, in which the domains I and II are two chymotrypsin-like \u2424-barrels domains and the domain III is an extra C-terminal \u2423/\u2424 domain similar to EAV nsp4. The active site is situated between domains I and II and harbors a canonical catalytic triad which comprises H39, D64 and S188 [18, 19] . The structure also reveals an atypical oxyanion hole and a partially collapsed S1 specificity pocket. H39, D64 and S118 are required for nsp4 to induce apoptosis, and nsp4-induced apoptosis is dependent on its serine proteinase activity. Moreover, the proteolytic activity decreased significantly, when the catalytic serine residue was mutated to alanine (S118A). It clearly confirmed the vital function of Ser118 as the nucleophile in catalysis [20, 21] . The abilities of nsp4 not only include functioning as the main proteinase but also suppressing NF-kB-mediated IFN-\u2424-production by interfering with the NF-kB signaling pathway in HeLa cells and CRL-2843 cells though the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO) at the E349-S350 site [22, 23] .",

Therefore, MD simulations have been used for extensive analysis, and the results often help to explain the experimental data. Although the structural and functional features of nsp4 PRRSV have been provided experimentally, various important aspects have not yet been addressed. Particularly, there is a lack of data on the comparison of nsp4 between type I and type II isolates. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to study the structural conformations of whole protein and the canonical catalytic triad including the mutation of its pocket site. Mutation of the amino acid at the catalytic triad could influence the native conformation. Therefore, the computational three-dimensional model structures of the protein might help in understanding the dynamics of conformational changes.",

The atomic coordinates of nsp4 of PRRSVAS were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The models were generated using the PDB entries 3FAN and 3FAO, respectively. 3FAO had a substitution of Ala for Ser118 at the catalytic triad pocket. The SWISS-MODEL program, a protein structure homology-modeling server (http://swissmodel.expasy.org) [32] , was used to enable the absence of electron density in the loop 136-140. The method is based on searching high identity protein template structures to build models for evolutionarily related target proteins. All missing atoms were reconstructed in Swiss-Pdb Viewer v4.1. After constructing nsp4 PRRSVAS, the three-dimensional models of nsp4 PRRSVES and PRRSVES (S117A) were modeled by a comparative modeling strategy using SWISS-MODEL based on evolutionarily related 3FAN to generate a structural model. The first model was selected and showed the best QMEAN score [33] . The programs Verify-3D [34] , ERRAT [35] and PROCHECK [36] were used to perform quality analysis of the models at the SAVES server (https:// services.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/). Before performing MD simulations, the N-and C-termini of each structure were capped with acetyle (ACE) and methyle amino (NME) groups.",

Each model was solvated by SPC216 water molecules in a cubic box keeping a distance of 1.0 nm between each side of the solvated box and the protein. We added three sodium ions (Na + ) to make the simulation system electrically neutral using the default program. The minimization was performed using the steepest descent algorithm until the maximum force was less than 1000 kJ/mol/nm on every atom and was implemented with the Amber ff99SB-ILDN force field [39] . The equilibration for dynamic simulations was performed under NVT (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) for 1000 ps and then was followed by NPT (constant number of particles, pressure and temperature) for 5000 ps. The first step was conducted under the NVT condition at 300 K using the modified Berendsen thermostat [40, 41] . The NPT ensemble followed at 1 bar of pressure using Parrinello-Rahman barostat [42, 43] . After equilibration, the full dynamic production was performed for a period of 100 ns under the NPT condition at 300 K and 1 bar of the system. The LINCS algorithm was used to constrain the bond lengths by performing a 2-fs time step [44] . The cut-off distance were set to 1.0 for the short rang interactions. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method with a Fourier grid spacing of 0.12 nm accounted for long-range electrostatic interactions [45, 46] . The atomic coordinates were recorded every 10 ps for further analysis.",

After the elimination of translational and rotational movements, a covariance matrix was generated from the trajectories. Diagonalization of the covari-ance matrix was then performed to yield a set of eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues representing the direction and amplitude of a motion. Ranking the eigenvector was subsequently conducted by decreasing eigenvalues. The first principle component analysis or the first eigenvector represented the largest contribution to the total fluctuation of the protein. The motion of each PC was visualized by projecting the protein conformations of trajectories onto each eigenvector of interest and then they were transformed back to atomic coordinates.",

The root mean square deviations (RMSD), and root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) were calculated to estimate the MD trajectory quality and convergence. The 100 ns simulations first analyzed the RMSD values (Fig. 2) . The RMSD values ranged from 0.06-0.27, 0.07-0.26, 0.09-0.27, 0.07-0.27 nm for PRRSVAS, PRRSVAS (S118A), PRRSVES, and PRRSVES (S117A), respectively.

The RMSD values did not exceed 0.35 nm indicating that all MD trajectories reached equilibrium. The time fluctuations of the radius of gyration (Rg) were monitored to equilibration in each system. The Rg values showed similar trends indicating that the protein structure equilibrated and remained compact though the simulations. Furthermore, SASA results were analyzed to support the Rg data. The result demonstrated that SASA values followed a similar trend ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). It is clear that the flexibility of PRRSVAS, PRRSVAS (S118A), PRRSVES, and PRRSVES (S117A) remained stable and was similar in trend to the mutant as well. Moreover, the RMDS of the catalytic triad was also calculated. The results revealed that the S118A of PRRSVAS and S117A of PRRSVES residues were less stable than the residues of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2C,D) . These results are related to biochemical studies indicating that when the catalytic serine residue mutated to alanine (S118A), the proteolytic activity decreased significantly [20, 21] .",

We therefore performed PCA to investigate the similarities and differences in the dynamics of each system. Additionally, the quality and direction were represented by the first principle component (PC1) which were individually generated from the MD simulations. The relative contribution of the different eigenvectors to the overall motion of the protein clearly demonstrated that the bulk of protein dynamics could be described by a small number of eigenvectors. Furthermore, the insert revealed the cumulative proportion of the total variance captured by each eigenvector from the PCA of the trajectories. The results showed that the first few eigenvectors of the four systems shared the common trend that a largest minimum plateau eigenvector is the first eigenvector and then the eigenvalues decreased with increased eigenvector index until they reached a plateau. Nevertheless, the degree of the steepness exhibited by PRRSVES, PRRSVES (S117A), PRRSVAS and PRRSVAS (S118A) suggested that the wild type protein is more stable than the mutant protein (Fig. 4A) . We also calculated the displacement of PC1 of the four systems in order to reveal that the point mutations at the catalytic triad had an effect on the motions. In Fig. 4B , the result suggests that PRRSVAS (S118A) had an impact on the motions of residues 3, 5, 12, 23-37, 52, 69-79, 83-84, 121, and 133. PRRSVES (S117A) affected mainly the motion of domain I and domain II, which was consistent with the result of RMSF analysis. However, PRRSVES (S117A) obviously affected the motions of residues 15-20. Moreover, we showed in Fig. 4C that the motion of eigenvector 1 in Fig. 4C demonstrated that residues 136-142 near the active site was highly flexible.",

The amino acids at the catalytic triad are expected to maintain H-bond interaction around the site. Therefore, substitution of the amino acid at the active site results in changing H-bond interactions. In Table 3 , we calculated occupancy percentage of the hydrogen bond interactions at the catalytic triad. Each interaction pair maintained at least a 10% interaction. We found that H39 showed a high occupancy percentage of the hydrogen bond interactions with D64, S118, and T134. D64 also had H-bond interactions with A37, A38, and T134, while S118 demonstrated interactions with G21, S22, H134, T134, and G135. More interestingly all residues are conserved in PRRSVAS, PRRSVES, LDVC, LDVP and EAV. Additionally, the results also revealed that mutation at the catalytic triad had an impact on changing H-bond interactions; S118 of the wild-type protein formed H-bonds with T134 and G135 but these interactions were lost in PRRSVAS (S118A) and PRRSVES (S117A). Therefore, the substitution of important H-bond interactions in PRRSVAS (S118A) and PRRSVES (S117A) had an effect on the flexibility around the catalytic triad, conformation and the proteolytic activity.

We have therefore performed molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and principle component analysis (PCA) to investigate the functional roles of the catalytic triad and conformational dynamics of type I and type II of nsp4 PRRSV. The results of MD simulations showed that the RMSF of residues 136-142 near the active site of all models were highly flexible. Moreover, we identified the effect of single mutations of the structure at the catalytic triad. The results revealed that the mutations increased the percentage of residues with a 0.1 nm RMSF value in domains I and II. The PCA also demonstrated that the wild types were more stable than the mutants. The distances between His39 and Ser118 were very flexible, while the distances between His39 and Asp64 were very stable. In PRRSVAS (S118A) mutation, the distance between A118HA:H133O and A118OG:G135H was lost while PRRSVEV (S117A) showed thst A118OG:G134H disappeared as well. In addition, at the catalytic triad H39 there was a high occupancy percentage of the hydrogen bond interaction with D64, S118, and T134. D64 also had H-bond interactions with A37, A38, and T134, while S118 demonstrated interactions with G21, S22, H134, T134, and G135.

Overall, our research may provide the structural basis of the catalytic triad that cannot be ascertained experimentally, and be useful for testing protein activity in future experiments. Moreover, these findings may help us to understand the functional mechanisms of type I and type II nsp4 PRRSV and develop a new approach to control PRRS infection in the future.",
