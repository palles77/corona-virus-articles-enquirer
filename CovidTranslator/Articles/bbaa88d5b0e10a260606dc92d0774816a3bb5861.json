The results clearly document an inverse correlation of age with the incidence of SGVHD. Virtually a 100% incidence of SGVHD occurs in Lewis rats when syngeneic BMT and CsA therapy are started when the animals are 4 wk of age . Thereafter, there is a dramatic decline in the incidence of SGVHD with the increasing age of the animals. Although the age of the recipient was important, the most significant effect was the age of the marrow donor . Marrow from animals 6 mo of age was virtually incapable of eliciting SGVHD after BMT and CsA therapy. Furthermore, mixing the marrow from mature and immature animals resulted in a decreased incidence of SGVHD, implicating a regulatory effect present in the marrow from older rats. This regulatory effect was due to the presence of mature T cells in the marrow from animals 6 mo of age. Despite the fact that marrow from young animals possesses mature T lymphocytes, this regulatory activity was absent, suggesting that the host resistance mediated by T lymphocytes develops as the animal ages. These data further implicate the importance of a host resistance mechanism in preventing the induction of SGVHD with CsA, which appears to be mediated by the clonal inactivation of autoreactive cells .",

It has been used extensively in clinical transplantation to prevent solid organ allograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (3, 4) . CsA is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic agent for the treatment ofautoimmune disease, and the results from these trials appear quite promising (5) . Despite its potent immunosuppressive activity, CsA therapy after autologous or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation paradoxically elicits a T cell-mediated autoimmune syndrome with pathology identical to GVHD occurring after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Hence, this CsA-induced autoimmune syndrome was originally termed syngeneic GVHD (SGVHD) (6) . The immunobiology of SGVHD is complex and is not completely understood, but it appears to be due to the uncoupling of normal immunologic homeostasis involved in self-nonself recognition (11) .",

This autoimmune disease, which occurs 14-21 d after cessation of CsA therapy, is mediated by T lymphocytes (6, 7) and is intimately associated with the appearance of OX8+ (CD8) autocytotoxic T cells that recognize a public epitope on class II major histocompatibility antigens (8) . A W3/25+ (CD4) Th cell subset also plays an essential role in disease manifestation (7) . Further studies have suggested that a T lymphocyte-dependent host resistance mechanism must be eliminated before the development of this autoaggression syndrome can occur (11, 12) . Of additional importance are the recent findings that indicate that in addition to thymic irradiation and CsA treatment, age is a critical variable for the induction of SGVHD (13) ; animals >3 mo of age are much more resistant to the induction of autoimmunity with CsA . The mechanism accounting for the resistance of mature animals is unknown, but it may be related to the lack ofa pronounced effect of CsA on the thymic medulla, as postulated by Beschorner et al. (14) . On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that there are increased numbers ofautoregulatory cells in older animals, thus preventing the clonal amplification of autoreactive cells (13) .",

The cells were then incubated with the microspheres (one cell/five beads) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C on a hematology mixer. To remove the unbound cells from the suspension, the tube was held near a magnetic particle concentrator (P & S Biochemical, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for a few minutes, and then the nonadherent population was removed with a Pasteur pipet. The positively selected cells were complexed to the microspheres localized by the magnetic fluid.",

At this dose of CsA, SGVHD was induced in 90% ofrats 3-6 mo of age when the marrow donor was 1 mo old . Taken together with the results presented in Fig. 2 B, it appears that the recipient age variable can be overcome by increasing the dose of CsA and the use of donor marrow derived from younger animals .

Bone marrow from donors 1 or >6 mo of age was transfused at first alone into lethally irradiated 8-9-wk-old recipients. As controls, two different doses, 3 x 107 and 6 x 107 nucleated cells, were used to reconstitute the recipients. The experimental groups received a total of 6 x 107 bone marrow cells derived from donors 1 and >6 mo of age mixed in equal proportion.

Notably, recipients of marrow from donors >6 mo of age did not develop disease if reconstituted with 3 x 107 cells and only one of eight rats transfused with 6 x 107 cells developed mild SGVHD. Recipients of 3 x 107 cells from 1-mo-old donors combined with 3 x 107 cells from donors >6 mo of age demonstrated the same timing and incidence of clinical SGVHD as those receiving marrow from the mature donors alone. In summary, the transfusion of marrow from more mature animals influences the potential of bone marrow from immature animals to induce autoimmunity.

            "text": "Mature Animals that Modify the Induction of SGVHD The studies described above demonstrated that marrow from mature animals modified the induction ofSGVHD when added to the marrow inoculum from animals 1 mo of age. A series of experiments was undertaken to identify and characterize the cell population responsible for this effect. Marrow from Lewis rats of 1 or 6 mo of age was separated on the basis of size and density by counterflow centrifugal elutriation, a technique routinely used to T cell deplete human bone marrow (16) and recently adapted for use in the rat, allowing excellent recovery of the cells (17) . Small lymphocytes are purged at a flow rate of 25 ml/min, larger lymphocytes and myeloid cells at 29 ml/min, and the clonogenic hemopoietic and blast cells are collected by stopping the rotor, thus named the R/O fraction . Initial studies compared the separation characteristics of marrow from 1-and 6-mo Lewis rats. There was a moderate increase in the number of cells isolated in fraction 25 of marrow from 1-mo-old animals (44%) compared with marrow from animals 6 mo of age (28%). This was reflected by differences in yield from the 29 and R/O fractions (fraction 29, 11% and 16%; R/O fraction, 43% vs. 53%, respectively) . Studies were performed to assess if a given fraction from the marrow of donors 6 mo of age was responsible for preventing the induction of SGVHD. Marrow from Lewis rats 6 mo of age was elutriated into 25, 29, and R/O fractions, and 4 x 107 cells from each fraction were transfused with 2 x 107 or 4 x 107 unfractionated bone marrow cells from 1-mo-old syngeneic donors into lethally irradiated recipients (8-9 wk of age). The incidence ofSGVHD in the recipients was recorded after 30 d of CsA therapy with clinical observations and sequential biopsies until the time of autopsy. The results are summarized in Table 2 Marrow was harvested from 6-mo-old Lewis rats and fractionated by elutriation . Unfractionated marrow or the respective 25, 29, R/O elutriation fractions (4 x 107 cells) were added to marrow derived from 1-mo-old syngeneic Lewis rats and infused into Lewis rats (8) (9) wk of age). As controls, the recipients received either marrow from rats 1 or 6 mo of age or the elutriation fractions separately. The recipients were treated with a 30-d course of CsA therapy (15 mg/kg/d) and observed for the onset of SGVHD. marrow from donors 6 mo of age resulted in five of eight rats developing SGVHD. However, SGVHD did not occur in recipients receiving either 2 or 4 x 107 bone marrow cells from the immature donors and 4 x 107 elutriated bone marrow cells isolated in fraction 25 from donors 6 mo of age. Thus, fraction 25 had the most potent inhibitory effect on the prevention ofsyngeneic GVHD. Addition ofthe R/O and/or fraction 29 from marrow of 6-mo-old animals to unfractionated marrow from donors 1 mo of age did not significantly influence the induction ofsyngeneic GVHD. Furthermore, animals grafted separately with the R/O fraction or the 29 fraction from marrow of animals 6 mo of age, engrafted and developed SGVHD after a course of CsA (15 mg/kg) therapy. Animals did not engraft when fraction 25 was used singly. The potent capability ofunfractionated marrow from donors 6 mo of age to inhibit the primary induction of syngeneic GVHD with marrow from immature animals appeared to be isolated in elutriation fraction 25. This fraction also accounted for the inability of marrow from animals 6 mo of age to allow the induction ofSGVHD. Further studies were 89 Fischer and Hess undertaken to phenotypically characterize the cells contained in fraction 25 of marrow from both mature (6 mo) and immature (1 mo) Lewis rats. Single-color flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that fraction 25 from animals 6 mo of age (mean of three experiments) had a predominance of cells with mature T lymphocyte markers : 22.6% OX19+, 12.3% CD4+, and 8.4% CD8+ . (Table 3 ) . Fraction 25 from 1-moold animals had 12.5% cells with mature T cell markers, and a predominance of B cells (OX 33+) and cells expressing OX7 or Thy-1.1 (B cells also express OX7). There was also a significant percentage ofcells not staining with any markers. The greatest difference appeared to be the reduced number of T cells in fraction 25. Comparatively, the marrow R/O and 29 fractions from both groups had minimal total T cells defined by staining with OX19 (fraction 29 <15% ; R/O <5%). Furthermore, fraction 29 is only a small percentage (11-16%) of the entire elutriated marrow.",

            "text": "Role of the Host Resistance Mechanism on the Induction of SGVHD A series of experiments was undertaken to identify the role of the host resistance mechanism in preventing the induction of SGVHD. The results from the studies described above indicate that addition of mature T lymphocytes from animals 6 mo of age to the marrow inoculum at Graft composition the time of transplant prevented the development of SGVHD. One hypothesis to account for the inhibition of the development of SGVHD is that the mature T lymphocytes (contained in marrow or in spleen) expand during CsA therapy to levels capable of preventing the expression ofthe autoreactive cells generated during therapy. Recent data suggest that mature T lymphocytes can expand in a thymec-and antigenindependent environment (18). To assess ifthe mature T lymphocytes including the cells responsible for host resistance clonally expand, thymectomized Lewis rats were grafted with marrow depleted ofT lymphocytes by elutriation . 2 wk after transplantation, the recipients were infused with 5 x 106 splenic T lymphocytes (nylon wool-nonadherent cells) and treated with CsA (10 mg/kg/d) or the control diluent for 30 d. After therapy, the recipients were infused with 3 x 101 effector T lymphocytes from animals with active SGVHD. The results in Table 6 demonstrate that SGVHD could not be transferred into the bone marrow-reconstituted, thymectomized recipients grafted with 5 x 106 T lymphocytes. However, SGVHD could be transferred if the recipients were treated with CsA . This was not due to the primary induction of SGVHD, since control thymectomized recipients treated with CsA did not develop disease, thus confirming the data of Sorokin et al. (7) . These data suggest that CsA interferes with the expansion of a T lymphocyte-dependent host resistance mechanism carried over with mature T lymphocytes and could not prevent the adoptive transfer of disease with 3 x 107 effector cells . Graded doses of T lymphocytes in fraction 25 of elutriated marrow and in nylon wool-nonadherent spleen cells derived from Lewis rats of 1 and 6 mo of age were added to marrow of 1-mo-old syngeneic animals. The number of T cells was estimated by expression of OX19 with immunofluorescent staining . The mixture of cells was infused into irradiated syngeneic Lewis recipients (6-8 wk of age), and the rats were treated with the standard course of CsA therapy (15 mg/kg/d, for 30 d) . Animals were observed for the onset of SGVHD after discontinuation of CsA treatment. We also compared the efficacy of infusing mature splenic T lymphocytes from animals 6 mo of age, either on the day of transplantation or the day of withdrawal of CsA therapy (day 30), and the results are summarized in Table 7 . SGVHD could not be induced if the T lymphocytes were infused on the day oftransplant . However, development ofSGVHD was observed despite the infusion of 3 x 107 normal splenic T lymphocytes (from animals 6 mo of age) on the day of C&A withdrawal. These data suggested that the frequency of autoreactive lymphocytes exceeded the minimum number of cells that can be regulated by the host resistance mechanism transferred with 3 x 10' normal T lymphocytes. To assess if autoreactive cells could be detected in animals receiving marrow plus mature T lymphocytes at the time of transplant, a series ofadoptive transfer studies was performed harvesting cells on the day of CsA withdrawal. Since CsA therapy prevented the clonal expansion of the host resistance mechanism carried over with mature T cells in the marrow inoculum, the premise in these experiments was to evaluate the autoreactive potential of the lymphocytes in animals grafted with marrow and mature T cells before clonal activation (due to the presence of C&A) and the subsequent transfer into an environment with a reduced or absent host resistance mechanism. Transfer of splenocytes (5 x 107) from C&A treated recipients grafted with marrow plus 10' T lymphocytes (from animals 6 mo of age) harvested on day 30 into secondary recipients did not result in adoptive transfer of disease (0/6). However transfer of spleen cells (5 x 107) from CsAtreated animals grafted with marrow but in the absence of T cells resulted in the development of SGVHD in the secondary recipients (5/6).",

Previous studies have clearly identified three important elements necessary for the induction of SGVHD and the resultant imbalance between autoaggression and autoregulatory suppression . First, CsA is a necessary requirement for the induction of SGVHD since this syndrome only occurs in syngeneic BMT recipients treated with this drug, although rare exceptions have been noted (6, 21) . Second, radiation also appears to play an essential role in accelerating the appearance of disease. Cheney and Sprent (10) and Glazier et al. (6, 22) reported that normal, nontransplanted animals treated with CsA do not develop this autoaggression syndrome even if treated with very high doses of CsA . This is in contrast to the routine induction of syngeneic GVHD after whole-body irradiation, syngeneic BMT, and CsA therapy. Recent data suggest that in the absence ofradiation, CsA must be administered for 6 mo to induce this autoimmune disease (23). The third essential requirement is an intact thymus, which must be included in the field of irradiation . As shown by Glazier et al. (22) , shielding of the thymus during total-body irradiation results in the failure to induce this syndrome. Further evidence for the importance and pivotal role of an intact thymus was provided by Sorokin et al. (7) . Syngeneic GVHD could not be induced in thymectomized animals but required that an intact thymus be present . Although CsA treatment, radiation, and an intact thymus are required for the successful induction of SGVHD, the present studies have demonstrated that age is also a critical variable involved in this autoaggression syndrome. Virtually a 100% incidence ofSGVHD could be induced if the animals 92 were initially transplanted and treated with CsA beginning at 4 wk of age. Thereafter, the incidence ofSGVHD decreased dramatically with the increasing age of the animals. The inverse correlation of age with the successful induction of SGVHD was surprising since in many murine autoimmune models, increasing age correlates with the onset of disease (24, 25 ). An inverse relationship of age with induction of autoimmunity with CsA mice has recently been reported (13) . Of particular importance in our studies was the finding that not only was the age of the recipient a significant variable, but that the age of the marrow donor had an even greater effect . SGVHD could be consistently induced in older animals if the marrow was derived from animals 4 wk of age, but not if the marrow donors were 6 mo of age or older.",

            "text": "The effect ofthe recipient's age on the induction ofSGVHD appears in part to be related to the thymic function of mature animals and its relative resistance to CsA . Beschorner et al. (14) recently demonstrated a correlation between the age ofthe recipient receiving both mediastinal radiation and concomitant CsA therapy and the capacity of the thymus to regenerate its normal histologic integrity, post-CsA withdrawal . A prolonged disappearance of the medulla is more notable in immature rats than those of mature rats. There is an associated loss of medullary epithelium, Hassall's corpuscles, and class II antigen expression. Mature rats have a more prominent medulla before CsA therapy and hence are more resistant to thymic involution. Hassall's corpuscles disappear, however, the medulla still has fusiform epithelium, dendritic cells, and MHC class II antigen expression despite CsA therapy. It has been postulated that the loss ofthe thymic medulla and the marked reduction of MHC class II antigen expression by CsA treatment results in the abrogation ofclonal deletion mechanisms and the emergence ofself-reactive clones (8, 10, 19) . The relative resistance of the thymic medulla of mature animals to the effects of CsA (and the subsequent preservation of clonal deletion mechanisms) may account for the decreased ability to induce SGVHD in these animals. However, at present, we cannot exclude that the resistance of mature animals is, in fact, due to the ability to rapidly regenerate a thymic-dependent host resistance mechanism (see below).",

            "text": "The most surprising finding of our studies was that the incidence of SGVHD was significantly associated with the age ofthe marrow donor and had an even greater effect than the age of the recipient . In addition, the age of the recipient became less important if the donor marrow was derived from the youngest animals . Marrow from animals 6 mo of age was, to a large extent, incapable ofpermitting the induction of SGVHD despite the age of the recipient . In contrast, SGVHD could be consistently induced, even in mature animals, provided that the marrow was derived from animals 4 wk of age. Furthermore, mixing marrow from donors 1 and 6 mo of age elicited a reduced incidence of SGVHD, mimicking that obtained with marrow derived from rats 6 mo of age. These data implicated a regulatory effect present in the marrow of mature animals . Further studies demonstrated that the regulatory effect in the marrow from animals 6 mo of age was due to the presence of small, mature T lym- phocytes. Depletion of the T lymphocytes eliminated the modifying influence ofmarrow derived from mature animals on the induction of SGVHD when co-infused with marrow from rats 1 mo of age. In further support of the regulatory effect of mature T lymphocytes are the findings that: (a) T cell-depleted marrow from mature animals was able to permit the development of SGVHD; and (b) addition of splenic T lymphocytes from 6-mo-old rats to the marrow from animals 1 mo old prevented the induction of SGVHD. In contrast, although slightly less in number, the mature T lymphocytes contained in marrow from the immature animals did not prevent the development ofSGVHD. Dose-response studies clearly suggested that this regulatory activity was absent in marrow from the immature animals or was present at a very low frequency. Comparatively, some regulatory activity of splenic T lymphocytes from young animals on the induction of SGVHD was observed, but only at higher concentrations of cells. Much lower numbers o\u00a3 splenic T lymphocytes from animals 6 mo of age were required to prevent the induction of SGVHD. Taken together, these data suggest that this T cell-dependent regulatory system capable of modifying the induction of SGVHD develops as the animal matures . Our data are consistent with the observations of Sakaguchi and Sakaguchi (13) , who demonstrated that administration of C&A to newborn mice induced pleiomorphic organ-specific autoimmune diseases . CsA treatment was also noted to be far more effective if started on the day of birth rather than the third to seventh day after birth. Not even higher doses or protracted periods of C&A treatment could induce autoimmunity in adult mice. Sakaguchi and Sakaguchi (13) attributed these effects to the development of an autoregulatory system that prevented the amplification and expression of autoregulatory clones . They also postulated that CsA prevented the development of this autoregulatory system and that a temporary absence of this thymic-dependent regulatory system allowed the differentiation/activation of autospecific effector cells. Some of the early studies clearly implicated the role of a host resistance mechanism involved in controlling C&Ainduced SGVHD. The primary evidence included the finding that SGVHD could only be transferred into irradiated secondary recipients, not into normal animals, and that CsA treatment of normal animals did not induce the SGVHD syndrome although adoptive transfer of these spleen cells into irradiated secondary recipients resulted in the development ofsyngeneic GVHD (6, 10, 22) . These findings suggest that normal animals possess a radiation-sensitive component that regulates the activity of autoreactive cells, thus preventing the development of autoimmune GVHD. Adoptive transfer studies in our laboratory provided evidence that an irradiation-and cyclophosphamide-sensitive thymic-dependent system played a major role in the prevention of SGVHD (11, 12) . Furthermore, normal splenic T lymphocytes, when cotransferred with autoimmune effector cells, prevented the development ofsyngeneic GVHD in secondary recipients (12) . This regulatory effect of normal splenic T lymphocytes required collaboration between CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, findings comparable with the results of the present studies. Of impor- 93 Fischer and Hess tance was the finding that the adoptive transfer of this host resistance mechanism was dose dependent, requiring twice the number of splenic T lymphocytes to SGVHD effector cells . In contrast, the present studies demonstrate that addition of small numbers ofT lymphocytes to the marrow graft at the initiation of the induction phase prevented the development of SGVHD. The mechanism whereby the T lymphocytes from mature animals inhibit the induction of SGVHD is unclear. One possibility is that the mature T lymphocytes contained in the marrow graft expand (despite the presence of CsA) to levels that are able to modify the action of the autoreactive cells produced during the 30-d course of CsA therapy. Recent evidence presented by Powrie and Mason (18) suggest that mature T cells can proliferate in a thymic-and antigen-independent environment (thymectomized hosts reconstituted with T cell-depleted marrow) . The present studies demonstrate that thymectomized rats, reconstituted with T cell-depleted marrow and infused with small numbers of T lymphocytes were resistant to the adoptive transfer of SGVHD with effector splenocytes after waiting 30 d to allow expansion of the normal T cells. However, administration of CsA during this 30-d period prevented the expansion of this host resistance mechanism, and SGVHD was successfully transferred, clearly indicating that CsA prevented the expansion of this host resistance mechanism such that a limited number of effector cells (3 x 10') were capable of establishing disease in these animals . Further, infusion of 3 x 107 normal T lymphocytes on the day of C&A withdrawal failed to prevent development of SGVHD. These data imply that the number of autoreactive cells generated during CsA therapy exceeded the capacity of the host resistance mechanism contained in 3 x 107 normal T lymphocytes . On the other hand, only a minimum number of normal T cells (5 x 106) were required to be added to the marrow inoculum and infused on the day of transplant, to prevent the development of SGVHD. Since CsA administration prevented the expansion of the host resistance mechanism, it would seem likely that the host resistance mechanism contained in the mature T lymphocyte population carried over with the marrow graft inactivates the autoreactive cells as they are generated during the course of CsA therapy. This hypothesis is also supported by the failure to adoptively transfer SGVHD from animals grafted with marrow plus mature T lymphocytes to irradiated secondary recipients in which the host resistance mechanism had been eliminated. If the failure to induce SGVHD in animals grafted with marrow plus T lymphocytes from mature animals was due to a delicate balance ofautoreactivity and host resistance, thus maintaining active control (suppression) of the autoreactive cells, one would have expected to be able to transfer disease in an environment of reduced or absent host resistance, as shown by Cheney and Sprent (10) . Taken together, it seems likely that host resistance mediated by T lymphocytes from mature animals clonally inactivate the autoreactive cells. Inactivation or induction ofdonal anergy is thought to be the major mechanism controlling autoreactive cells that have escaped clonal deletion mechanisms in the thymus (26).",
