            "text": "We describe a new microsphere-based multiplex fluorescent immunoassay (MFI) using recombinant mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) proteins to detect antibodies to coronaviruses in mouse and rat sera. All the recombinant proteins, including nucleocapsid (N) and 3 subunits of spike protein, S1, S2, and Smid, showed positive reactivity in MFI with mouse antisera to 4 MHV strains (MHV-S, -A59, -JHM, and -Nu67) and rat antiserum to a strain of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV-681). The MFI was evaluated for its diagnostic power, with panels of mouse sera classified as positive or negative for anti-MHV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using MHV virion antigen and indirect fluorescent antibody assay. The reactivities of 236 naturally infected mouse sera were examined; 227 samples were positive by MFI using S2 antigen (96% sensitivity), and 208 samples were positive using N antigen (88% sensitivity). Based on the assessment by MFI using the S2 and N antigens, only 3 serum samples showed double-negative results, indicating a false-negative rate of 1.3%. In 126 uninfected mouse sera, including 34 ELISA false-positive sera, only 7 samples showed false-positive results by MFI using either the S2 or N antigen (94% specificity). Similarly, the S2 and N antigen-based MFI was 98% sensitive and 100% specific in detecting anticoronavirus antibodies in rat sera. Thus, this MFI-based serologic assay using the S2 and N antigens promises to be a reliable diagnostic method, representing a highly sensitive and specific alternative to traditional ELISA for detection of coronavirus infections in laboratory mouse and rat colonies.",

At present, the most widely used methods for diagnosis of MHV infections are serological tests by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent antibody assay (IFA). Although IFA is highly specific, it is subjective and is not suitable for screening of large numbers of samples. ELISA has better throughput but requires larger amounts of serum samples than IFA. Moreover, the MHV virion antigen currently used in ELISA is propagated in mouse cell lines, but purified viral antigens have some disadvantages, such as poor yields of purified viruses, less reproducibility of antigens, and contamination with cellular proteins, resulting in difficulties in quality control of antigens and frequent false-positive results in serological tests.",

Although the use of recombinant antigens in serological tests has been widely reported for a variety of infectious diseases (1, 4, 7, 13, 14, 17, 19, 21, 23) , no serological test using recombinant MHV antigens is currently available. MHV is composed of three major structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (N), spike protein (S), and membrane protein (M). The N, S, and M proteins all contribute to inducing host immune responses. The N protein is the most abundant protein in the MHV virion, with an amino acid sequence that is highly conserved among MHV strains. The S protein is the major target of the neutralizing antibodies and induces the earliest antibody responses (2, 5, 11, 18) . Therefore, we chose the N and S proteins as candidates to generate recombinant antigens for the detection of antibody responses to MHV infections.",

In a microsphere-based multiplex fluorescent immunoassay (MFI), microspheres function as the solid phase to which protein antigens from various pathogens are bound. One hundred sets of color-coded beads are used, and each bead set is distinguishable by its fluorescent emission when excited by a classification laser. Since each of the bead sets can be conjugated with a unique antigen, each bead represents a separate antibody reaction after incubation with the serum samples to be tested, followed by a fluorescently labeled detection reagent and fluorescent emission by a detection laser. Another distinct advantage of the MFI method is that a trace amount of serum sample is sufficient for multiplex detection.",

To set the cutoff value, an average median fluorescent intensity for more than 30 normal mouse or rat sera was calculated for each antigen, and three times the standard deviation (SD) value was added to the average.

At first, we attempted to prepare the recombinant S protein as a soluble GST fusion protein in the same way as the N protein. Since the S protein is too large to be produced efficiently in E. coli, we cloned each DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal S1 subunit, which forms the globular head of the peplomer, and the C-terminal S2 subunit, which forms the stalk region. In addition, the middle part of the S protein near the proteolytic site, which we designated Smid, was prepared. Since all the truncated recombinant S proteins in the GST fusion form were expressed in only small amounts, we finally produced the recombinant S1, S2, and Smid proteins as insoluble His-tagged proteins. Unexpectedly, immobilized metal affinity chromatography did not enable purification of a large amount of these His-tagged proteins efficiently. Therefore, we partially purified the insoluble His-tagged proteins by washing them in 1 M urea solution.

On immunoblotting analysis, all the major recombinant MHV proteins showed strong reactivity with anti-MHV-S mouse serum (Fig. 1C) . Several bands that do not correspond to the expected molecular masses of the recombinant MHV proteins were detected, and some of those were immunoreactive (Fig. 1B and C) . It is likely that the smaller proteins present in the affinity-purified GST-N protein preparation are degraded recombinant N proteins, since those are immunoreactive with anti-MHV serum. Multiple protein bands present in the His-tagged S protein preparations may be degraded proteins originated from the recombinant S proteins or E. coli proteins contaminating the insoluble inclusion bodies.",

Major disadvantages of virion antigen are the variation in purities of virion proteins, which affects the specificity and sensitivity, laborious work to prepare large amounts of antigen, the possibility of remaining infectivity, and the loss of reactivity during the inactivation process. First, we prepared the recombinant N protein as a soluble GST fusion protein. However, we found that the sensitivity of the N protein-based ELISA was lower than that of the traditional ELISA using virion antigen in a preliminary study. Therefore, we attempted to prepare recombinant S proteins in GST-fused and Histagged forms. Because the S protein is too large to be produced efficiently in E. coli, we prepared truncated molecules of the S protein, including the N-terminal S1 subunit, the C-terminal S2 subunit, and the middle part, designated Smid. In previous studies of MHV (3, 16) , bovine coronavirus (22) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (15, 26) , this middle region was identified as an immunodominant linear neutralization domain by analysis using a prokaryotic protein expression system and monoclonal antibodies or patients' sera. As a result, large amounts of the His-tagged S1, S2, and Smid proteins were produced as insoluble proteins and were solubilized in a high-molar urea solution. All of the recombinant S proteins that were solubilized under denaturing conditions using 8 M urea showed immunoreactivities with anti-MHV antibodies on immunoblotting and in MFI. We found that the MFI reactivity of the microspheres coupled with S proteins in 8 M urea-PBS was stronger than that of the microspheres coupled in PBS. These observations indicated that the recombinant S proteins solubilized with 8 M urea were capable of being cou-pled efficiently to microspheres in 8 M urea-PBS. These findings may reflect the appearance of insoluble aggregates of the recombinant S proteins in PBS, which leads to a decrease in coupling efficiency and MFI reactivity.",

Cross-reactivity of these recombinant proteins in detection of antibodies to other MHV strains and SDAV rat coronavirus was confirmed by MFI. According to the calibration curves constructed with the experimentally infected sera to MHV strains and SDAV, cross-reactivity levels of the recombinant proteins were compared. The median fluorescent intensity values corresponding to the 4 recombinant proteins were similar among the antisera. However, antiserum to MHV-JHM reacted very weakly with the S1 antigen. This weak reactivity was unlikely to be a consequence of the relatively low amino acid sequence identity (76%) of S1 between MHV-JHM and MHV-S, because the level of antibody to S1 in anti-MHV-A59 serum was equivalent to or higher than that in anti-MHV-S serum despite the even lower S1 identity (73%) between MHV-A59 and MHV-S. Furthermore, antiserum to MHV-Nu67 was remarkable for its lower level of antibody to the N antigen than to the S2 and Smid antigens. Such low reactivity to the N antigen may be reflective of the slow growth of MHV-Nu67, a low-pathogenicity strain isolated from nude mice (20) . This may be correlated with the observation that the S protein is the earliest recognized antigen by the host immune system, whereas the N protein elicits antibody responses during the late stage of infection (2, 15) . Nevertheless, the possibility that the differences in reaction pattern among the antisera to the virus strains described above were simply due to individual variation among the experimentally infected animals cannot be excluded.",

            "text": "The MFI calibration curve of each antigen constructed with anti-MHV-S serum suggested that MFI provides a broad dynamic range of antibody concentration, which allows accurate analysis of antibody levels at a single point of serum dilution. We assessed 32 mouse sera and 30 rat sera from MHV or SDAV/RCV-free commercial breeder animals at a 1:100 dilution and established an optimal antigen concentration and a cutoff median fluorescent intensity value corresponding to each antigen. The protein concentration providing the highest S/N ratio was determined as the optimal antigen concentration, and the mean median fluorescent intensity plus 3 SD value was set as a cutoff median fluorescent intensity value. According to these criteria, serial serum samples from experimentally infected mice and a large number of serum samples from naturally infected laboratory mice were analyzed to select the favorable antigens in MFI for detecting antibodies to MHV and to evaluate diagnostic predictability. An experimental infection study showed that seroconversion in the MFI took place from 7 to 14 days post-MHV infection in the majority of infected mice. In contrast, all of the infected mice seroconverted in ELISA by day 7. For early detection of MHV antibodies, ELISA is more sensitive than MFI, whereas the sensitivities of N-based MFI and S2-based MFI are equivalent to that of IFA. Because IFA is the primary method used as confirmatory testing for ELISA and MFI-based screening as-says, special attention should be paid to false-negative results in MHV antibody detection within 2 weeks after infection. With regard to the reactivity of sera from naturally infected mice, our results indicated that the S2 antigen has the highest sensitivity, but 4% (9 of 236) of samples still show false-negative results. The recombinant N antigen resembles the MHV virion antigen in immunoreactivity with naturally and experimentally infected sera. While the sensitivity of the N MFI was 88%, 6 of 9 false-negative samples in the S2 MFI showed positive results in the N MFI. These results indicated that multiplex serological screening, consisting of S2 MFI and N MFI, has 98% sensitivity for detection of MHV infection in mice. Naturally infected animal sera used in this study were retrospective serum samples screened for positivity for antibodies to MHV by ELISA and IFA. Therefore, it is likely that the sensitivity of MFI is equivalent to that of the traditional ELISA and IFA. Thirty-four sera that were negative for anti-N or anti-S2 antibodies may represent samples collected from mice at the early stage of infection. It is not likely that the failure to detect antibodies based on the MFI using the N or S2 on March 24, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ antigen resulted from a higher serum dilution in MFI (1:100 dilution) than that in ELISA (1:40 dilution), because no significant correlation was seen between ELISA OD values and median fluorescent intensity values in these sera. Many of the singly positive sera showed definite reactivity with either N or S2. Thus, production of antibody to each antigen varies among individuals or strains of animals as well as virus strains, and consequently, multiplex analysis using polyvalent antigens is recommended in recombinant antigen-based serologic testing. Based on the assessment of 126 mouse sera and 59 rat sera from animals uninfected with MHV or SDAV/RCV, which were confirmed by IFA, we found that the MFI had a significantly lower false-positive rate than the ELISA. The lower false-positive rate in MFI may be due to the lower nonspecific binding of serum antibodies to the microspheres than to ELISA plates (12) . In the case of the recombinant antigenbased MFI, the purified recombinant proteins are covalently coupled to microspheres, and antigen purity eliminates nonspecific reactions that often cause high background problems in ELISA (25) . Furthermore, the linear reaction and high sensitivity allow MFI to be used for analysis of serum samples at a dilution of 1:100. Since the MHV ELISA was performed using 1:40-diluted sera, the higher serum dilution in MFI definitely affected the low background.",

            "text": "In summary, the MFI method developed with recombinant MHV S2 and N antigens was as sensitive as and more specific than the traditional MHV ELISA for screening of antibodies to coronaviruses in mouse and rat sera. MFI-format assays have been used for the simultaneous detection of antibodies to a variety of pathogens in laboratory rodents (4, 8, 9) . Although MHV virion antigen was successfully used to develop the MFI system for serodetection of 10 mouse pathogens (9) , this is the first report of using a recombinant antigen-based MFI to detect MHV infection. There are many advantages to MFI over ELISA when screening large rodent colonies. MFI allows screening of animals for serum antibodies to multiple pathogens or antigens simultaneously in one reaction well for each animal. This markedly reduces the time and labor required to perform a separate ELISA for each antigen. The MFI format also requires much less serum than ELISA, since multiple agents can be screened using only 1 l of undiluted serum. In this regard, MFI is suitable for serological screening of small laboratory animals, such as mice, often through survival bleeding. The amounts of antigens required for coupling microspheres for 200 analytes are equal to those used for coating a single well of an ELISA plate, thereby greatly saving cost, time, and labor for preparing antigens. In our experience, antigencoupled microspheres can be stored in the refrigerator for at least 6 months without a significant reduction in immunoreactivity. The multiplexing feature of the MFI method enables high throughput and automated screening for serological detection of many infectious agents in laboratory animals.",
