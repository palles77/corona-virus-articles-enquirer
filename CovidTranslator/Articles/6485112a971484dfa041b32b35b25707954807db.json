Previous morphological evidence suggested that the TGN enlarged significantly under this condition. In the present study we have used stereological procedures to estimate the volume and surface area of the Golgi stack and the TGN of baby hamster kidney cells under different conditions. The results indicate that the increase in the size of the TGN at 20\u00b0C is accompanied by a significant decrease in the surface area and volume of the preceding Golgi compartments. A similar effect is also seen in uninfected cells at 20\u00b0C, as well as during normal (37\u00b0C) infection with Semliki Forest virus. In the latter case, however, the decrease in the size of the Golgi stack and the increase in that of the TGN is not accompanied by inhibition of transport from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. The results indicate that the Golgi stack and the TGN are dynamic and interrelated structures that are capable of rapid alteration in total surface area in response to changes in the rates of membrane transport.",

When a temperature-sensitive mutant, ts 045, of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was used to infect baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells at 39\u00b0C the build up of the viral membrane protein G in the TGN, during a subsequent chase at 20\u00b0C, was so extensive that this protein formed regular arrays which filled an extended tubular structure (Griftiths et al., 1985) . These striking morphological characteristics allowed unambiguous identification of the TGN in the absence of additional markers. The G protein was also seen in variable amounts in the cisternae of the Golgi stack. At the permissive temperature, 32\u00b0C, the G protein was transported rapidly to the plasma membrane. The labeling of G protein in the Golgi cisternae disappeared within 10 min of reversing the temperature block while a considerable amount of G protein was 1. Abbreviations used in thispaper: ce, cell; cy, cytoplasm; G, the envelope glycoprotein of VSV; go, Golgi complex; SFV, Semliki Forest virus; Sv, surface density (or surface to volume ratio); TGN, trans-Golgi netv,~rk; TPPase, thiamine pyrophosphatase; Vv, volume density. still observed in the TGN. Since G protein transport to the cell surface continued after this period, the TGN must be the site of exit for the G protein from the Golgi complex on its way to the plasma membrane. In fact, the only labeled structures at this point were the TGN and putative transport vesicles. The qualitative impression gained from these experiments was that the TGN increased in size as protein accumulated at 20\u00b0C and then decreased rapidly when the block was reversed and transport resumed.",

We show that the increase in the size of the TGN at 20\u00b0C is accompanied by a significant decrease in the size of the Golgi compartments preceding the TGN. We have also reexamined our earlier data on the intraceUular transport of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) . During infection of BHK cells with this virus, large numbers of rod-shaped structures covered with nucleocapsids are found in the cytoplasm (Acheson and Tamm, 1967; Grifliths et al., 1982) . These become especially prominent after 6 h of infection. We show here that these structures are due to an accumulation of SFV spike proteins in the TGN in the absence of a low temperature block. The total surface area of these structures is identical to that of the TGN in the VSV-infected cells at 20\u00b0C. These data suggest that the Golgi stack and TGN are highly dynamic structures capable of rapid alteration in surface area. Further, for the q'~3N there appears to be a critical maximal size beyond which it cannot expand.",

In our previous study (Griffiths et al., 1985) we defined the TGN as the tubular-cisternal structure on the trans side of the Golgi stack where the bulk of the G protein spikes accumulates at 20\u00b0C. This accumulation is best seen in cryosections. Not only can the spikes be labeled with antibodies, they are often directly visible in these preparations. The G protein-induced alteration in the shape of the TGN is, however, so characteristic that it can be easily recognized in the Epon-embedded sections (although much of the fine structure is lost). Epon-embedded sections offer a number of advantages over cryosections for stereological purposes: they are, for example, easier to section and to sam-pie. For this reason we chose to do this study using conventional Eponembedded sections. In earlier studies we have shown that values we obtained for a number of different stereoiogical parameters were the same for both types of preparations (Griffiths et al., 1984b; Griffiths and Hoppeler, 1986) . To confirm that we could identify the TGN unequivocally in the plastic sections in this study, however, we compared the two techniques directly (see below).",

For the stereological estimation of average cell height it is essentiafthat the sections be as close as possible to perpendicular (+ 15 \u00b0) (Griffiths et al., 1984a) . In this study, in addition to requiring vertical sections for the estimation of average cell height, we also wanted to take advantage of the recently published method for estimating Sv from vertical sections (Baddeley et al., 1986) . In this study, therefore, to be certain that we obtained true vertical sections (i.e., perpendicular to the plastic substrate) for the estimation of average cell height and Sv of the cell, we embedded the monolayer in situ in a thin, 1-2-mm layer of Epon. After polymerization the disc can be easily removed with pliers (this is done when the preparation is taken directly from the oven). Pieces roughly 3 x 8 mm are cut from this disc using a fine saw. Two of these discs were then sandwiched together and reembedded in Epon in a plastic embedding mould. In this way two strips of cells were obtained in each section.",

            "text": "Linear Intercept Method for Estimating Nuclear Volume. Gundersen and Jensen (1985) have recently developed a new method for estimating the volume density or volume-weighted mean volume (Vv) of discrete particles. This method depends on making isotropic random sections through the particles and then to sample the sections with a series of points. Each time a point hits the particle the intercept across the particle at that point is measured (1) in a direction which systematically varies from one picture to the next. The formula Vv = 7r X 7/3, where ~ is the mean of all values 13, is then an unbiased estimator of Vv (see also Cruz-Orive and Hunziker, 1986; Cruz-Orive, 1987 for more details). For BHK cells ,~0.5-/~m cryosections were prepared which were stained for 4 min with Hoechst dye for DNA. Using uv-light fluorescence, light micrographs were taken at random using a 40x lens. These were enlarged photographically \u202220 times. A' system of parallel lines containing a regularly spaced system of points was used as described by Cruz-Orive and Hunziker (1986; see their Fig. 10 b) . The positioning of the grid over The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 108, 1989 278 the micrograph was done as described by Cruz-Orive and Hunziker (1986; see their Fig. 10) . When the test points hit the nuclei the intercepts were estimated using a ruler. The intercepts_ were classified into a histogram of different size classes. The parameter 13 was estimated as described in formula 7.1 of C raz-Orive and Hunziker (1986) and Table I of Gundersen and Jensen (1985) . The coefficient of error was determined according to the formula",

For the uninfected BHK cells, as well as those infected with SFV, we had previously estimated the mean cell volume (i.e., the cell volume of an \"average\" BHK cell) at a low magnification using a novel procedure (see Griffiths et al., 1984a) . Random cell profiles were photographed at an intermediate magnification and the volume density (i.e., volume fraction per cell) of the Golgi complex was estimated by a simple point-counting procedure (Weibel, 1979) . Profiles of Golgi complex or TON were selected in higher magnification images and their surface density or surface to volume ratio (Sv) was estimated by relating the number of points over the structure to the number of intersections that their membranes made with the lines of a lattice grid (Weibel, 1979) . The Golgi complex, as defined here, means the total cisternal, as well as intracisternal space: this is our reference volume for the ratio of the membrane surface area of the Golgi stack to its volume (Sv[go, go] ). The absolute surface area of these organelles could then be calculated as S (go) = S~ (go, go) x Vv (go, cy) x Vv (cy, ce) x V (ce), where S (go) is the absolute surface area of the Golgi stack (cisternal) membranes; S~ (go, go) is the ratio of the membrane surface area of the G-olgi stack to its volume; Vv (go, cy) is the ratio of the volume of the Golgi stack to the volume of the cytoplasm; Vv (cy, ce) is the ratio of the volume of the cytoplasm to the volume of the cell; and V (ce) is the absolute volume of the cell.",

In retrospect, it is likely that some endosome profiles were included in the measurements (Marsh et al., 1986) and that some parts of the TGN were excluded in that analysis. This is the most likely explanation for the significantly higher estimates obmined for the total membrane in the Golgi stack in the present study than for the \"total Golgi complex\" in the previous study (see Appendix) . The same problem applies to the identification of the TGN in uninfected cells in the present study; the TGN in the BHK cell can only be unambiguously identified when it is filled with G protein. In this study we estimate either the total Golgi suck (excluding any associated vesicles) or the TGN in the case of VSV-infected cells at 20\u00b0C (as well as up to 30 min after switching from 20 to 32\u00b0C) or SFV-infected cells at 37 and 20\u00b0C.",

By counting intersections of the lattice grid with the membrane profiles the ratio of membrane in the cisternal part of the TGN to that in the tubular-reticular part was then estimated for all the sections in the set (ratio of intersections). The results from five sets were pooled to evaluate the approximate proportion of the total TGN surface that is cisternal.

For this, the ratio of points over, and the number of intersections with, the membranes of the TPPase-reactive (trans side) as well as the TPPase-unreactive cistemae (cis side) within the Golgi complex was estimated at Level III magnification.

The mean cell volume is a critical parameter since any error in its estimation will be reflected in a corresponding error in all surface and volume parameters of the organelles we measure. For this reason, in the present study, we wanted to make sure that the values we obtained were as valid as possible. We have, therefore, used two different stereological approaches to this problem (see Materials and Methods). In addition, a biochemical method has recently been used by Davoust et al. (1987; and unpublished data) . The results obtained by these different approaches are summarized in Table I . By the two stereological methods there was no significant difference between the mean cell volume after 2 h at 20\u00b0C when compared to cells grown at 37\u00b0C. In our previous study using method 1, we found no difference in cell volume between uninfected cells and those infected with SFV (Grittiths et al., 1984a) or with VSV (Grittiths et al., unpublished dafa). Although we did not measure the cell volume directly in the virus-infected cells used in this study, the fact that the surface to volume ratio of the cells (Table III ) and the ratio of cytoplasm per cell (Table II) did not differ significantly from the uninfected cells makes it highly unlikely that cell volume was significantly different due to infection.",

For the VSV-infected cells kept at 20\u00b0C, the Vv and Sv of this organelle have also been estimated. A first, striking observation is that the ratio of the volume of Golgi stack to that of the cytoplasm is substantially reduced at 20\u00b0C. This is evident both with and without VSV infection, indicating that whatever the mechanism that is responsible for this reduction, it is not due to viral infection. Hence the qualitative impression of a large expansion in the TGN is accompanied by a quantitative decrease in the size of the remaining compartments of the Golgi. In the uninfected cells kept at 20\u00b0C, although the TGN is not unequivocally identifiable, there is an elaboration of a tubular-reticulum that is more evident than in cells kept at 370C (Fig. 5 ). In the VSV-infected cells kept at the permissive temperature (32\u00b0C) the Golgi stack was significantly larger than in infected cells kept at 20\u00b0C, but significantly smaller than in uninfected cells (Table II) .",

First, the membrane of this structure is continuous with the membrane of a cisterna on the trans side of the Golgi stack (see Fig. 17 in Griffiths et al., 1982; and Figs. 6 b and 7) . Second, the structure has coated buds which morphologically resemble clathrin (Fig.  10) ; within the Golgi complex, clathrin is exclusively localized to the TGN (see Griffiths and Simons, 1986) . Parts of these structures label extensively with antibodies to the SFV spike proteins (Figs. 6 and 8, b and c) . The lack of label over some parts (Fig. 6 b) is most likely due to steric hindrance (Griffiths et al., 1985; Griffiths and Hoppeler, 1986) . In ad- The comparison of morphometric parameters from Epon-embedded and cryosection data shows no significant difference between means (at tbep = 0.2 level). The two sets of data are, therefore, indistinguishable. n, number of micrographs.",

We tested this by transferring SFV-infected BHK cells, which had accumulated spike proteins in the TGN at 37\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C for 2 h, to see whether further accumulation of viral membrane proteins in the cell could cause further expansion of the TGN. This was not the case since we again obtained the identical size for the TGN (Table VI) . The accumulation of SFV envelope proteins was, however, accompanied by a further 50 % shrinkage in the size of the stacked region of the Golgi stacks (Table VI ). In addition, numerous vesicular structures were seen with nucleocapsids on their periphery and membraneenclosed virions in their lumen (Fig. 12) . These vesicles are reminiscent of those formed when treatment with monensin causes a block in glycoprotein transport in the Golgi (Griffiths et al., 1983b) and suggest that the spikes now accumulate in a Golgi compartment proximal to the TGN at a concentration high enough for capsids to bind and for intracellular budding to occur.",

The extent of the decrease in the surface area of the Golgi stack is far greater than the estimated increase in the size of the TGN (see Table VIII ). It is evident, therefore, that a large pool of membranes \"disappears\" from the balance sheet. An obvious question is what happens to this membrane. For reasons explained in the discussion it seemed reasonable to propose that this \"loss of membrane\" could be due to a proportionately small increase in the size of the ER at 20\u00b0C. We therefore estimated the volume density of the ER in uninfected cells at 20\u00b0C and at 37\u00b0C. As in our earlier paper (Griffiths et al., 1984a) , we used glucose-6-phosphatase as a cytochemical marker since this gives an electron-dense reaction product throughout the ER of the BHK cell, thus facilitating its identification (result not shown). This reaction may also stain the cis-Golgi compartment (see Gritiiths et al., 1983b;  in the absence of a bona fide cis-Golgi marker this question cannot be addressed). The results indicate that the volume density of the ER is increased at 20\u00b0C, but this difference was only significant at the p = 0.11 level by the t test. (Table VII) .

            "text": "The structure and function of the Golgi complex has played a major role in the development of our ideas concerning the function of this organeUe (see Dunphy and Rothman, 1985; Grifliths and Simons, 1986 for recent reviews). We had previously shown that the intracellular transport of newly synthesized G protein of VSV from the ER to the cell surface is significantly reduced at 20\u00b0C (Grifliths et al., 1985) . As a result of this block in intracellular transport the G protein accumulated in the TGN. Within minutes of reversing the block by warming the cells to 32\u00b0C the G protein was rapidly transported to the cell surface, a process that continued for at least 60 min, even in the presence of cycloheximide. In the present study we have estimated the total surface area of the Golgi stack and the TGN of BHK cells under different experimental conditions using routine stereological procedures. As for any stereological study where estimates of absolute surface areas (or volumes) of an organelle are required, the first prerequisite is to know one parameter that can serve as a \"reference space\" for the estimates (Weibel, 1979) . The most logical absolute reference space is the mean volume of the \"average\" cell. During the course of this study we discovered an error in the calculation of the mean cell volume in our earlier study. To be as sure as possible that the values we obtained in this study were valid, we have used two independent stereological methods. The two methods, which both have inherent errors associated with them, gave results which differed from each other by '~25 %. In addition, a recent biochemical estimation by Davoust et al. (1987 and unpublished data) using the same source of BHK cells as was used in our study, gave a very similar result. We decided, therefore, to take the average of the values obtained by the three methods, namely 1,400 #m 3, for the mean cell volume that we used for the subsequent calculations. The two key stereological parameters we were interested in were first, the volume fraction of (a) the total flattened cisternae of the Golgi stack and (b) the TGN per BHK cellcytoplasmic volume, and second, the surface to volume ratios of their membranes. Knowing these values and the mean cell volume enabled us to estimate the total surface areas of membrane in the Golgi stack and the TGN under different experimental conditions. We estimated that at 20\u00b0C in VSVinfected cells, 12% of the TGN is made up of a flattened cisternal part while the bulk has a tubular-reticular structure (see Fig. 1 ). This division of the TGN into two distinct structural domains is observed in many cell types (see, for example Fig. 18 of Rambourg and Clermont, 1986) and may be analagous to that seen between the rough and smooth ER (Palade and Porter, 1954) . It is also evident, if less pronounced, in the other Golgi cisternae (see for example in Hermo et al., 1980, Figs. 5, 6, and 11) . These also appear to be divided into flattened rigid cisternae in continuity with peripheral regions where tubules and buds are seen (Hermo et al., 1980; Rambourg et al., 1979; Rambourg and Clermont, 1986) . Whether these structural differences reflect different functional domains of the Golgi compartments remains to be established.",

Also in VSV infection at 32\u00b0C a similar, though less pronounced effect was evident. In this latter case the morphological definition of the TGN was not clear. In contrast, the SFV-infected cells had an expanded TGN which assumed a distinct morphology, primarily comprising extensive rod-shaped structures that are packed with viral spike proteins. The appearance of the TGN modified by the accumulation of SFV spikes is quite different to that seen after a build up of VSV spikes. This most likely reflects the difference in the structure of the two spikes. The SFV spike is a columnar structure (Fuller, 1987) which in the absence of capsids could pack into locally flat arrays to form the tubular rods rather than the curved vivions. Our data suggest that capsid-binding is not essential to the formation of the rods. In contrast to the structure of the SFV spike, the G protein is more expanded at its distal end (Adrian et al., 1984) and would be more likely to form a curved structure in the absence of underlying nucleocapsid proteins. We could not det Iriffiths et al. Dynamic Nature of Golgi Complex tect the M or N accessory capsid proteins of the VSV in the TGN at 20\u00b0C, nor is there any morphological evidence for nucleocapsids at this site (Griffiths et al., 1985, and unpublished data) .

(This \"block\" is not a complete one: increasing amounts of G protein are detected at the cell surface after 2 h at 20\u00b0C [Griffiths et al., 1985] ). In the case of SFV-infected cells our unpublished data suggest that the rate of spike protein synthesis is significantly higher than that for the VSV-G protein at the permissive temperature but, in this case, transport to the surface is not blocked. This accumulation of SFV spike proteins may, therefore, simply be due to the saturation of the capacity to transport proteins from the TGN to the cell surface. When further synthesis of SFV spike protein was prevented with cycloheximide, the TGN was emptied of spike proteins indicating that these proteins were not irreversibly blocked at this site.",

Assuming that the rate of decrease in the total surface area of the TGN under this condition reflects the movement of membrane from the TGN to the plasma membrane we could estimate that, on average, no more than 2.7 #m2/min of membrane could move from the TGN to the cell surface. This value agrees with that obtained by Johanson et al., (1984) who estimated that between 1 and 3/xm 2 of membrane was exocytosed every minute in thyroid follicle cells. A slightly higher estimate was obtained by Cope and Williams (1973) who estimated the rate of exocytosis for the parotid gland. In that study the amount of membrane of secretion granules that fused with the plasma membrane 2 h after isoproterenol treatment was estimated to be 1,343 #m 2, which gives an average of 11 #m 2 per min. Exocytosis of VSV-G protein reflects the constitutive pathway while in the parotid gland it is the regulated pathway that was estimated. The precise nature of the secretion in the thyroid remains unclear. All three conditions are similar in that they are likely to estimate conditions where membrane traffic from the TGN to the plasma membrane is at maximum rates. A surprisingly small number of vesicles (340/min per cell if they are 50 nm in diameter; only ~90 if they are 100 nm) is therefore capable of transporting a relatively large flux of G protein to the plasma membrane. This may explain why it has always been difficult to identify these vesicles morphologically.",

            "text": "Under normal conditions the size of the Golgi compartments, including the TGN must be kept constant by keeping the amount of membrane that exits from them equal to the amount that enters. Even slight changes in the rates of either of these parameters can have rapid and drastic effects on the size of the compartments. In this study there are two observa-tions that we would like to explain, namely the increase in the size of the TGN and the concomitant decrease in the size of the Golgi stack. Although we do not understand the mechanisms responsible for these phenomena it should be noted that the increase in the size of the TGN is much smaller than the decrease in the size of the Golgi stack. In other words, we apparently \"lose\" membrane during this process (see Table VIII ). This could be either due to a reduction in the net rate of delivery of membrane from the ER to the Golgi or to an increase in the net rate at which membrane exits from the Golgi (or some combination of both). There are two reasons why we do not favor the latter process. First, both the cell volume, as well as the surface to volume ratio of BHK cells does not significantly change at 20\u00b0C, indicating that the surface area of the plasma membrane has not changed. Second, the observation of many budding profiles in the TGN (Griffiths et al., 1985) suggests that vesicle formation is somehow blocked at 20\u00b0C. In addition, recent data from van Deurs et al. (1987 van Deurs et al. ( , 1988 indicate that transport from the plasma membrane to the TGN is similarly blocked at this temperature. These considerations make it more likely that the overall decrease in the size of the Golgi complex can best be explained by an increase in the size of the ER. The estimations of the volume density of the ER indeed suggest that the size of this compartment is increased at 20\u00b0C. The actual differences in the means of the Vv estimates at 37 and 20\u00b0C is roughly equivalent to ~o20% increase. Since the surface density has not changed this suggests that the total surface of th e ER has increased by 20%, or 1,680 #m2/cell. This, in fact, is more than enough to account for the loss of membrane from the Golgi complex at 20\u00b0C (for example, for the uninfected cells the difference between the Golgi stack at 20 and 37\u00b0C is 1,440 #m2; Table VIII ). Further support for this idea comes from the earlier data of Flickinger (1968) who described the \"disappearance\" of the Golgi stack in an amoeba after enucleation; this was accompanied by a striking (qualitative) proliferation of the ER.",

            "text": "Finally, an interesting aspect of the regulation of membrane traffic in the cell which is illuminated by this study is the control of the size of compartments functioning in intracellular transport. Qualitative reports of striking increases in the size of the TGN (GERL) as well as the whole Golgi stack have been made for many cell types (see Morr6 et al., 1979 for a review). There are also many examples of significant reductions in the size of the Golgi complex under various conditions (Flickinger, 1968; see Morr6 et al., 1979 for a review). With respect to the TGN, a \"hypertrophy\" of this or-ganeUe has been described in secretory cells that occurs after cells are stimulated to secrete (see Hand and Oliver, 1984) . Moreover, in a number of pathological conditions that presumably require more lysosomal enzyme production, there is also a proliferation of the TGN (Decker, 1974; Novikoff and Novikoff, 1977; Paavola, 1978a,b; Blest et al., 1978) . Our results suggest, in addition, that the TGN appears to have a characteristic maximal size beyond which it cannot expand. This may reflect the need for the cell to maintain critical concentrations of characteristic TGN components to maintain the functional integrity of this compartment. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for regulating compartment size are now major challenges to understanding the function of the Golgi complex.",

The value we published was, in fact, 2.4 times the correct value. This led to a significant overestimation (by a factor of 2.4) of the mean cell volume, the volumes of ER and Golgi complex (as defined in that study), as well as of the surface area of plasma membrane, ER, and Golgi complex. Note in addition that we have refined our methods for estimating the volume density and surface density of these organelles in the present study. The most reliable estimates we have for the absolute volumes and surface areas of cell, Golgi stack, and ER are given in Table IX of the present paper.
