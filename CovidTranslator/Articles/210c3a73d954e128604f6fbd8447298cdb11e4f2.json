            "text": "Antibody rejection is often accompanied by non-donor HLA specific antibodies (NDSA) and selfreactive antibodies that develop alongside donor-specific antibodies (DSA). To determine the source of these antibodies, we immortalized 107 B cell clones from a kidney transplant recipient with humoral rejection. Two of these clones reacted to HLA class I or MICA. Both clones were also reactive to self antigens and a lysate of a kidney cell line, hence revealing a pattern of polyreactivity. Monoclonality was verified by the identification of a single rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) sequence for each clone. By tracking their unique CDR3 sequence, we found that one such polyreactive clone was highly expanded in the patient blood, representing ~0.2% of circulating B cells. The VH sequence of this clone showed evidence of somatic mutations that were consistent with its memory phenotype and its expansion. Lastly, the reactivity of the expanded polyreactive B cell clone was found in the patient serum at time of rejection.",

The main targets of these humoral responses are HLA class I and class II molecules expressed on donor cells that are mismatched with those of the recipients. These antigens are recognized as non-self by the host immune system due to their polymorphic allelic determinants and lead to the generation of donor specific antibodies (DSA) . Serological responses to other targets have also been reported following kidney transplantation, including non-donor specific antibodies (NDSA) [4] [5] [6] [7] , i.e. antibodies reactive to HLA molecules not expressed by the donor cells. How NDSA develop is still uncertain. The most widely accepted explanation is that NDSA and DSA cross-react to public epitopes shared by multiple HLA [8] [9] [10] [11] . In other instances, especially in the absence of DSA, the generation of NDSA is thought to result from previous exposure to non-donor HLA, for example via blood transfusion and pregnancies.",

In a recent study, we used a combination of solid phase techniques including protein microarrays, to characterize serological profiles of kidney transplant recipients with chronic humoral rejection (CHR) [23] . Our experiments showed that patients' sera reacted to numerous autoantigens, at the time of CHR. Moreover, serum reactivity patterns appeared remarkably unique for each individual with only minimal overlap between patients. These complex serological responses, combining allogeneic and autoimmune components are intriguing and difficult to explain.",

His original disease was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The first kidney failed 12 years after the initial transplant, consecutive to cyclosporine vasculopathy and focal acute cellular rejection. The second kidney graft was transplanted 5 years after rejection of the first one and functioned for about 1.5 years. It was removed because of suspected pyelonephritis. Sections from the nephrectomy specimen showed a dense mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate with marked tubulitis and interstitial hemorrhage. The infiltrate contained focal aggregates of neutrophils. C4d staining was negative in peritubular and glomerular capillaries. In summary, the nephrectomy showed acute cellular rejection, type III, superimposed on chronic rejection. The patient had a slight positive CMV serology 4 months post-transplant. The serology became negative after a month of treatment. The patient received 2 blood transfusions 3 year prior to the second transplant. HLA typing of the blood donor was not documented. The HLA typing of the patient and of both donors are as follow: Recipient: A2,26; B8,70; Bw6; Cw2,3; DR11,13; DQ3; Donor 2 nd kidney: A1; B8,44; Bw4,6; Cw5,7; DR15,17; DQ1,2; Donor 1 st kidney: A2; B7,44; Bw4,6; Cw5,7; DR4,6; DQ1,3. Anti-Class I and Class II antibodies were detected at low level before and after the second transplant. Reactivity to both Class I and class II was significantly higher at time of nephrectomy. The collection of all clinical specimens and medical information used in the study was approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital internal review board.",

However, the 2 clones that displayed the highest reactivity to self were clones 4G4 and 4G10 that also reacted to HLA or MICA molecules (Figure 1 ). Clone 4G4 strongly reacted to HEK293 lysate, dsDNA and insulin whereas clone 4G10 was the most reactive to dsDNA and also showed some reactivity to insulin. These results provided evidence that both clones were polyreactive, i.e. reactive to a broad range of antigens not related to one another. We selected these 2 polyreactive clones, together with another B cell clone showing reactivity to dsDNA and HEK293 lysate but not HLA/MICA molecules (3E7) as well as a non-reactive clone (3B3) for further analysis. As depicted in Figure 2B , supernatants from clones 3E7, 4G4 and 4G10 but not 3B3 reacted to the carcinoma cell line Hep-2 in a comparable manner as self-reactive antibodies developing in patients with autoimmunity.",

PCR amplification of the clones cDNA using a series of 6 forward primers corresponding to the 6 immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) families, generated a unique band for 3E7, 4G4 and 4G10 ( Figure S1B ). Further analysis of the PCR products revealed a single sequence with a distinct rearranged Complementary Determining Region 3 (CDR3) for each clone. While sequences from clones 3E7 and 4G4 were identical to a germline segment, the sequence of clone 4G10 displayed multiple point mutations upstream of the CDR3 domain ( Figure 3A ). The mutation frequency for this clone was 3.1% at the nucleic acid level with a percentage of silent mutations of 22.2% ( Figure 3A, lower panel) . Accumulation of somatic mutations in the variable region of rearranged immunoglobulin genes is a hallmark of differentiated memory B cells. As shown in Figure 3B , mutated clone 4G10 cells highly expressed CD27, consistent with a memory phenotype, whereas clones 3E7 and 4G4 did not ( Figure 3B ). We also verified that the immortalized clones originated from the recipient. As shown in Figure  S3 , clones 3B3, 3E7, 4G4 and 4G10 expressed HLA-A2 molecules, a mismatch HLA class I allele between the recipient and the donor of the explanted kidney graft.",

This approach consisted in screening a large number of PCR amplified VH sequences by hybridization with CDR3 specific probes to detect and quantify sequences corresponding to any of the 3 B cell clones. Approximately 900 sequences of the corresponding VH family generated by PCR using RNA extracted from the graft tissue were first screened for each clone using a dot blot technique ( Figure  S2 ). None of the 3 clones could be detected (data not shown). The same technique was then carried out with RNA extracted from the patient's blood. No positive signals corresponding to the CDR3 sequences of clones 3E7 and 4G4 could be found, indicating that they were either absent from the patient's blood or represented at very low frequency. In contrast, clone 4G10 CDR3 sequence was detected at a high frequency (4.45%) among VH2 sequences. Since approximately 5% of human B cells use the VH2 segment [27] , we estimated the frequency of 4G10 at 0.22% of all blood B cells. This high frequency revealed that clone 4G10 had undergone vigorous clonal expansion in vivo, which is consistent with the memory phenotype and the accumulation of somatic mutations in its rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. The fact that clone 4G10 was found at high frequency in the blood but not in the graft strongly suggested that it was immortalized from residual blood cells in the explanted kidney tissue.",

Moreover, the serum was also reactive to Hep-2 cells, dsDNA and insulin as antibodies produced by clone 4G10 did (Figures 5B and 5C ). The correspondence between the serum reactivity pattern and that of clone 4G10, together with the observation that this clone was highly expanded in the blood, strongly suggest that antibodies produced by 4G10 are present in the serum and contribute to its overall reactivity.",

Likewise, the monoclonal antibody secreted by immortalized B cell clone 4G10 recognizes several HLA class I molecules in Luminex based assays. However, its reactivity pattern exceeds the sole recognition of public HLA epitopes as it also reacts to DNA, Hep-2 cell cytoplasmic structures and HEK 293 protein lysate. The fact that the patient serum reacted to the same non-donor specific HLA molecules than that recognized by clone 4G10, together with the demonstration that this clone was highly expanded in the blood, suggested that polyreactive 4G10 antibodies contributed to the serum reactivity. Remarkably, reactivity to HLA-B44, a donor allele recognized by polyreactive 4G10 antibodies, represents only a small component of the overall serum reactivity. It is plausible that additional high frequency polyreactive clones produced antibodies targeting other HLA molecules, including HLA-A1, the donor specific allele towards which the serum was the most reactive. At this point however, we cannot discriminate which components of the serum result from monospecific or polyreactive antibodies.",

Polyreactive IgM, known as \"natural IgM\", are commonly observed in healthy individuals and are thought to be produced by B1 B cells (for review: [28] ). Our experiments demonstrated the unexpectedly high frequency of clone 4G10 in the blood of a patient with ongoing rejection. This frequency implied a considerable expansion in vivo that was consistent with the accumulation of somatic mutations found in the immunoglobulin heavy chain region as well as the expression of the CD27 memory marker by the corresponding immortalized B cell clone. We hypothesize that this clone is not unique but rather, is representative of a discrete subset of memory, somatically mutated polyreactive B cells, producing \"natural IgM\" under physiological conditions. Upon activation in the context of inflammation associated with graft rejection or as a result of common infection related to immunosuppression, these polyreactive B cells would expand, undergo class switch recombination and produce IgG. Remarkably, clone 4G10 underwent class switch recombination in vitro and produced both IgM and IgG in the culture supernatant. Although this was likely the result of EBV immortalization and TLR9 stimulation by CpG [29, 30] , it revealed the capacity of 4G10 cells to expand, undergo class switch recombination and secrete antibodies upon stimulation.",

The immortalization rate was comparable for all subsets, showing that no significant bias would be introduced through the immortalization process. Moreover, the percentage of polyreactive B cells among the 107 clones is consistent with the frequency of polyreactive B cells described by the group of Michel Nussenzweig showing, using a molecular approach, that the percentage of polyreactive B cells was contained between 4 and 7% of all B cells (for review: [31] ). Polyreactive antibodies have been described for many years, especially as a first line of defense against bacterial infection [28, 32, 33] . Their implication in humoral responses to solid organ grafts, however, has not been examined and will warrant additional mechanistic studies to determine whether they play and active role in tissue destruction or whether production of these antibodies is more a consequence of graft dysfunction.

All weakly positive dots observed for 3E7 were false positive. Each membrane was also screened for the presence of a VH sequence using a consensual JH probe. The ratio of positive clonotypic sequence on total VH sequence is reported for each clone. Patient's serum reactivity. (A) The reactivity of the patient's serum IgG to HLA class I molecules was tested by Luminex. The 20 alleles towards which the serum was most reactive are depicted for 3 time points post transplantation. Class I alleles towards which clone 4G10 was most reactive are depicted as red bars. Class I alleles expressed by the donor are labeled with an asterisk. (B) The patient's serum IgG reactivity to Hep-2 cell was determined using a sample collected at time of transplant nephrectomy (20 months posttransplant). The serum of a representative non-CHR patient was used as control. Staining was revealed using a FITC-conjugated anti-IgG secondary. (C) Serum reactivity to self antigens. The patient's serum collected 20 months post-transplantation was assessed for reactivity to dsDNA and insulin by ELISA. A serum sample collected from a non CHR patient was used as control. The reactivity was revealed using an HRP-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody.",
