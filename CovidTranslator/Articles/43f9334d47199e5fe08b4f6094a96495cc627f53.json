In February 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) received a report of 305 cases from that province [1] . The disease spread very rapidly and by April 30th, 2003, 5663 cases were reported globally from countries on four continents [2] . At the end of July 2003, SARS had spread to 30 countries and had affected more than 8000 people, resulting in almost 774 deaths worldwide [3\u2022] . It took an economic toll of at least 30 billion dollars. The causative microorganism for the disease has been identified to be a novel coronavirus [4\u2022\u2022,5,6] . The disease is transmitted by droplets and direct contact, although airborne and oralfecal route transmission cannot be excluded.",

            "text": "The early cases of SARS probably occurred in southern China. In November 2002, there were many cases of severe pneumonia of unknown etiology in Guangdong Province in southern China, with a high rate of transmission to health care workers [1] . A 64-year-old physician from southern China, who visited Hong Kong on February 21, 2003 and died 10 days later of severe pneumonia, is thought to have been the source of infection, causing subsequent outbreaks of SARS in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada [7\u2022,8,9] . The index patients of these cities had been exposed to the Guangdong physician while they were visiting China or had been staying on the same floor of the same hotel. By May 21, 2003 , 1719 patients in Hong Kong had SARS, and 20% were health care workers. Two hundred and fifty-five patients died during this period. SARS appears to spread by close person-to-person contact through droplet transmission or fomite. The high level of infectivity of this viral illness is highlighted by the fact that 158 patients were hospitalized with SARS within 2 weeks as a result of exposure to one patient in a general medical ward in Hong Kong. The use of a jet nebulizer for administering bronchodilators to the index case, who presented clinically with community-acquired pneumonia, could have increased the droplet load around the patient and, with the overcrowding condition in the hospital ward, contributed to this major hospital outbreak [10\u2022\u2022].",

Clinically speaking, coronaviruses are usually associated with the common cold in humans, but in animals the virus can cause highly virulent respiratory, enteric, and neurologic diseases and hepatitis. The detection of the virus in sputum and feces indicates more than one tissue tropism with protean clinical presentation. The full sequence of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was recently reported by a Canadian collaborative group [11, 12] . With 29,751 bases, the genome, denoted Tor-2, possesses a classic coronavirus complement of 11 open-reading frames, spike (S), membrane (M), and small envelope (E) glycoproteins, and the matrix, replicase, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. However, at the amino acid level, SARS-CoV has minimum homology with any of the three classes of coronavirus; thus, SARS-CoV is in its own group. In a separate study comparing full-length genome sequence analysis of 14 SARS-CoV isolates, a remarkable genetic conservation of the virus was found since the outbreak was first documented in February Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and predominantly pneumonic illness caused by a novel coronavirus now commonly known as SARS-CoV. This article describes the key diagnostic clinical features, radiologic features, and investigation profiles of affected patients. We summarize our understanding from anecdotal experience and limited published data on the use of antiviral and corticosteroid therapy in the management of this highly contagious disease.",

Furthermore, the virus sequence in patients with massive diarrhea showed few nucleotide differences compared with earlier patients with respiratory symptoms [14] . Thus, alterations in the SARS-CoV genome are unlikely to have caused the distinctive clinical features of syndrome. The apparent genetic stability makes a vaccine seem more achievable in 1 or 2 years. SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from Himalayan palm civets found in a live-animal market in Guangdong [15] . Evidence of viral infection also was detected in other animals, including a raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and rats, and in humans working at the same market. All the animal isolates retain a 29-nucleotide sequence that is not found in most human isolates. The detection of SARS-CoV-like viruses in small live wild mammals in a retail market indicates a route of interspecies transmission, although the natural reservoir is unknown.",

Transaminases, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are elevated slightly in 40% to 60% of our patients, and these tend to normalize simultaneously with clinical and radiologic recovery [7\u2022 ]. Features of low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (ie, thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, and elevated D-dimer levels), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (reflecting lung injury) and creatinine kinase levels (reflecting myositis), are common laboratory features of SARS.

All patients will eventually develop airway opacities during the course of the disease. The opacities occupy a peripheral or mixed peripheral and axial location in more than 80% of patients [20] . The predominant involvement of the lung periphery and the lower zone, in addition to the absence of cavitation, hilar lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion at diagnosis, are the more distinctive radiographic features of SARS [20] . Radiographic progression from unilateral focal airspace opacity to multifocal or bilateral involvement during the second week of the disease course, followed by radiographic improvement with treatment, is commonly encountered. The radiologic appearances of SARS have been described as similar to those of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, which include the periphe r a l a p p e a r a n c e o f l u n g o p a c i t i e s, l owe r l o b e predominance, and a mixture of ground-glass opacities and consolidation (Fig. 1a) . Contrary to bronchiolitisorganizing pneumonia, there is no lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion in SARS [7\u2022,21] . In one report, 12% of patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum, and 20% of patients developed evidence of ARDS over a period of 3 weeks [18\u2022]. In general, the incidence of barotrauma in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions seems higher than expected despite treatment with low-volume and low-pressure mechanical ventilation, yet excessive hyperinflation or bullous lung disease is not commonly encountered.

Rapid progression of ground-glass opacification, sometimes even overnight, despite potent antibiotic therapy, is probably the most helpful diagnostic clue. Air-space opacification often progresses in size, extent, and severity within a few days. In severe cases, diffuse opacification suggestive of ARDS develops despite intensive treatment. Very rarely, nodules not dissimilar to those seen in miliary tuberculosis also appear in a background of groundglass opacification, and this necessitates invasive investigations, such as transbronchial biopsies, because milary tuberculosis and fungal infections have to be excluded. This is particularly important during later stages of the disease, when patients might develop secondary infection of the lung after receiving considerable doses of corticosteroids.",

The epidemiologic criteria include travel (including transit in an airport) within 10 days of the onset of symptoms to an area with current, recently documented, or suspected community transmission of SARS, or close contact within 10 days of the onset of symptoms with a person known or suspected to have SARS infection. Laboratory criteria include: the detection of an antibody to SARS-CoV in specimens obtained during acute illness or 21 days after illness onset; the detection SARS-CoV RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that was confirmed by a second PCR assay by using a second aliquot of the specimen and a different set of PCR primers; or the isolation of SARS-CoV.

Molecular assays currently available for detection of SARS-CoV have low sensitivity and specificity during the early stage of the illness [25, 26] . Recently, by combining the modified RNA extraction method and real-time quantitative PCR technology, one laboratory reported a positive detection rate of 80% (40 of 50 samples) in the nasopharyngeal aspirate samples by the real-time RT-PCR assay [27] . Although sensitivity of 80% might seem acceptably high, there is a highly significant proportion of patients who would be \"missed\" by this test if used as a lone diagnostic criterion, as it is commonly and perhaps erroneously perceived. The specificity of these RT-PCR assays also is unknown, thus making these tests unqualified as gold standard diagnostic tests. These findings must be validated by other laboratories and in larger sample numbers. Serologic testing of the detection of specific immunoglobulin-G against SARS-CoV is very specific, but it takes 30 days for just over 90% of patients to show a significant increase (fourfold) in titer [18\u2022 ]. It does not help in establishing the diagnosis at early and key phases of an outbreak, and the sensitivity and specificity of SARS serologic tests also are unknown. The periods during which SARS-CoV infection is confirmed by molecular or serologic testing are summarized in Table 1 . Even the pathologic findings of SARS-related ARDS, readily recognizable on autopsy and open-lung biopsies as diffuse alveolar damage, are still regarded as nonspecific [28] .",

Most of these patients (70% to 80%) appeared to have a favorable response to the combination treatment, with resolution of fever and lung opacities within 2 weeks, whereas approximately 23% of the same cohort required ICU admission, and 14% required invasive ventilatory support [10\u2022\u2022] . However, the use of ribavirin therapy in patients with SARS is associated with significant toxicity, including hemolysis (76% of patients) and a decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (49% of patients), elevated transaminase levels (40% of patients), and bradycardia (14% of patients) [9] . The other reservation is that ribavirin exhibits no in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV. This raises the question of whether the improvement could be caused by the immune defense of the patient rather than the antiviral effect of ribavirin. Another drawback of early introduction of corticosteroid was the possible link between its use and avascular necrosis of bone, detected in at least 10% of patients by routine magnetic resonance imaging scanning criteria (Unpublished data).",

One of the promising agents is Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), an antiprotease designed against HIV. In a recent retrospective analysis of patients from Hong Kong, it was shown that the addition of Kaletra as initial treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the overall death rate (2.3%) and intubation rate (0%), compared with a matched cohort that received the aforementioned standard treatment (15.6% and 11%, respectively) [31] , and a lower rate of use of methylprednisolone rescue therapy at a lower mean dose. However, the subgroup that had received Kaletra as rescue therapy showed no difference in overall death rate and rates of oxygen desaturation. In vitro studies reveal lopinavir exhibits in vitro activity against the prototype SARS-CoV and acts in synergism with ribavirin [32] . Yet with the toxicity of ribavirin, any treatment regimen for SARS needs to be tested with a randomized placebo-controlled design. Other potential therapeutic agents, based solely on in vitro studies, are the \u03b1and \u03b2-interferons [33] and thus have less clinical basis to be used as the preferred first-line therapy.",

Experimental and SARS-related ARDS are characterized by pulmonary infiltration of macrophages releasing macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) that finally causes severe alveolar damage [28, 34] . Experimental acute lung injury or ARDS is effectively ameliorated by corticosteroid of anti-MIF treatment [34] . Thus, the use of corticosteroid in phase 2 or 3 of SARS infection is an appropriate therapeutic approach based on animal studies of ARDS. A recent study has shown the superiority of pulse steroid over nonpulse steroid in the treatment of SARS-induced ARDS [30\u2022\u2022] . Despite similar cumulative steroid dosage, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and hematologic and biochemical parameters in both groups after 21 days, patients in the pulse steroid group had less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome, and less likelihood of requiring rescue-additional pulse steroid therapy than did their counterparts. Thus, initial use of pulse methylprednisolone therapy appears to be a more efficacious and an equally safe steroid regimen compared with regimens with lower dosage, and should be considered the preferred steroid regimen in the treatment of SARS, pending data from future randomized controlled trials. Anti-MIF therapy is effective in ameliorating the pulmonary injury in the experimental ARDS model, but the supply limits clinical use in humans. Because MIF induces tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3 production in macrophages through an amplifying proinflammatory loop [35] , the use of anti-TNF-\u03b1 (available commercially) also may be considered as an adjuvant immunomodulatory agent as demonstrated in other pathological conditions [36] . Convalescent serum from patients who recovered from SARS has been suggested as an alternative immunomodulatory treatment [10\u2022\u2022] . Nevertheless, its use is limited by the supply of serum from donors and risk that the viral infection may even be aggravated by the antibody-dependent enhancement",

We hope that the availability of the genome sequence of the SARS-CoV will facilitate efforts to develop new and rapid diagnostic tests, antiviral agents, and vaccines. SARS patients who have recovered from the acute illness should be monitored carefully for the possibility of continued viral shedding and the potential development of pulmonary fibrosis or long-term complications. The prevention of spreading the illness is most important for this highly infectious disease. Isolation facilities, strict precautions against droplet exposure among health care workers managing patients with SARS, the avoidance of the use of nebulizers in a general medical ward, contact tracing, and quarantine isolation for close contacts are all important measures.",
