Therefore, the purpose of our study was to describe the clinical and clinicopathological findings in adult horses experimentally infected with ECoV. We hypothesized that by means of gut-derived ECoV, a reproducible animal model of infection would mimic clinical signs of natural disease. Our study differs from the previous report in that a larger number of demographically relevant adult horses were used. Additionally, our study sought to establish a fecaloral route of infection as a model for future studies.",

Before study commencement, all 8 horses were screened for current illness by CBC and physical examination including temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, thoracic and abdominal auscultation, assessment of mentation, mucous membrane quality and color, and evaluation of fecal consistency. All physical examinations and CBCs were within normal limits. In addition, before the study started, all study horses tested seronegative for ECoV-specific antibodies using a recently established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 10 Furthermore, fecal samples from all horses were collected and tested for ECoV, Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, Clostridium perfringens, Neorickettsia risticii, rotavirus, Lawsonia intracellularis using qPCR and Salmonella spp. using microbiological culture. All horses were negative for all screened pathogens. Fecal egg counts to determine parasite burden were not performed. The horses were randomly assigned to either the experimentally-infected group (group 1) or the naturally-exposed group (group 2) for this randomized experimental study.

This horse died from endotoxemic shock secondary to ECoV infection confirmed at necropsy. 2 The intestinal contents of that horse were tested and found to be negative for Salmonella enterica, C. difficile toxins A and B, N. risticii, and L. intracellularis by culture or qPCR and subsequently stored at \u221280 C. Electron microscopy confirmed that this sample contained ECoV-like viral particles, which were quantified by qPCR as previously described 8 and found to contain 2.5 \u00d7 10 9 genome equivalents of ECov per gram of intestinal content. The sample was diluted in phosphate-buffer saline to deliver 1000 mL of inoculum containing 1 \u00d7 10 9 genome equivalents of ECoV. Each of the 4 experimentallyinfected horses was restrained in the stall, given 40 \u03bcg/kg romifidine (Sedivet, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ridgefield, CT) IV, and exposed by nasogastric intubation to the above-mentioned ECoV inoculum. A medium-bore nasogastric tube was advanced into the left or right nares and intragastric placement was confirmed by obtaining gastric contents upon lavage with 1 L of plain water. Once placement was confirmed, 1 L of diluted intestinal contents containing 1 \u00d7 10 9 genome equivalents of ECoV was administered by gravity feed, followed by an additional liter of plain water. The tube was removed immediately after the procedure. Once fecal shedding was confirmed by qPCR in these 4 horses, single samples of fecal material, or approximately 8 cups, were moved twice daily from the infected horses' stalls to the noninfected horses' stalls as a model of natural exposure to ECoV. This ECoV positive fecal material was placed on the stall floor next to or on top of the hay that the exposed horse would consume and was removed during stall cleaning 24 hours later.",

Our study resulted in a similar affected rate of 75% of horses, but clinical signs were mild and self-limiting. The Although quantity of viral particles in fecal material was not found to be significantly different among groups, clinical signs did vary and, if related, could indicate a minimum contagious dose that results in clinical signs. A single horse in our study (Horse 4) exhibited higher viral shedding loads (up to 2.4 x 10 8 ECoV genome equivalents per gram of feces) than those previously associated with horses that succumbed to the disease (2.9 x 10 7 ECoV genome equivalents per gram of feces). 5 This finding is interesting for several reasons: this horse was the only horse in our study to become both pyrexic and viremic, albeit at different times. This observation may indicate that nasogastric inoculation of the virus is more representative of clinical disease. It is also a positive finding, indicating that virulence is not lost, as can be the case with cultured virus. The virus source used in our study was feces of a previously infected horse as opposed to pure viral culture, because of difficulty in performing the latter, 12 and in agreement with a previous study. 9 Electron microscopy could have been used instead of virus isolation. However, given the low sensitivity of the former test 13 and previous documentation of the use of qPCR for the highly conserved N protein, 4, 14 we are confident in the performance of the qPCR used for the detection of ECoV. Therefore, other diagnostic modalities were not pursued in the study horses.",
