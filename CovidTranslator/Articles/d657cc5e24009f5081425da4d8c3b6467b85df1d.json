To study the retention of p63, mutant forms were expressed in COS cells and the intracellular distribution determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Investigation of chimeric constructs between p63 and the plasma membrane protein dipeptidylpeptidase IV showed that protein sequences from all three domains of the p63 protein are required to achieve complete intracellular retention. Mutational analysis of the 106-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of p63 revealed that the NH2-terminal 23 amino acids are necessary for retention. When Igi3 was solubilized with Triton X-100 and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 g, it formed large, insoluble oligomers, particularly at neutral pH and below. A comparison of the behavior of wildtype and mutant p63 proteins in this assay revealed a perfect correlation between the formation of large oligomers and correct intracellular retention. These results suggest that self-association may be a major mechanism by which p63 is retained between the rough ER and the Golgi apparatus.",

            "text": "It is currently believed that secretory proteins are transported by a default pathway while resident proteins are selectively retained in individual organelles by means of specific signals (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Wieland et al., 1987; Karrenbauer et al., 1990) . Two types of signais, which mediate either the retention or the retrieval of proteins, have been identified to date. A variety of lumenal ER proteins are retained in the cell by means of a COOH-terminal tetrapeptide (KDEL) or related sequence (Munro and Pelham, 1987;  reviewed by Pelham, 1989 Pelham, , 1990 ) that allows retrievai of the proteins from a post-ER site by means of KDEL receptors Pelham, 1990, 1992) . A group of type I transmembrane proteins of the ER are also retained in this or-ganelle by a retrieval mechanism (Jackson et al., 1993) . These proteins contain cytoplasmic sequences consisting of two lysine residues positioned three and four or five residues from the COOH terminus (KKXX or KXKXX, where X can be almost any amino acid) (Jackson et ai., 1990; Shin et ai., 1991) . Recycling of these proteins is believed to occur from multiple post-ER locations along the secretory pathway (Jackson et ai., 1993) . In addition, retrieval has been suggested to be the mechanism by which the integral membrane protein TGN38 is targeted to the TGN (Bos et ai., 1993; Humphrey et al., 1993) . TGN38 possesses a tyrosine-containing motif within its cytoplasmic tail that is both necessary and sufficient for TGN localization (Bos et ai., 1993; Humphrey et ai., 1993; Wong and Hong, 1993) . In contrast to these examples, localization of Golgi proteins is achieved by retention rather than retrieval. The retention of several Golgi proteins has been shown to depend primarily on their single transmembrane segment with some additional contribution to retention by the sequences just adjacent to those membrane anchors (Nilsson et ai., 1991; Swift and Machamer, 1991; Machamer et al., 1993) . In the case of the c~ 2,6-siaiyltransferase, the cytoplasmic and lumenal sequences flanking the transmembrane segment appear to be the crucial elements for retention rather than the transmembrane segment itself (Munro, 1991; Dahdal and Colley, 1993) . It has been postulated that resident Golgi proteins oligomerize in the Golgi apparatus upon recognition of identical or related proteins, forming a complex of sufficient size to prevent entry into transport vesicles (Machamer, 1991; Nilsson et al., 1991 Nilsson et al., , 1993 Nilsson et al., , 1994 . Recently, oligomerization of a chimeric protein containing the first membrane-spanning domain of the M glycoprotein of avian coronavirus has been correlated to its retention in the Golgi apparatus (Weisz et al., 1993) .",

The ERGIC comprises a membrane system interposed between the rough ER and the cis side of the Golgi apparatus that has been shown to mediate ER-to-Golgi exocytic protein transport (Schweizer et al., 1990; Lotti et al., 1992) . The ERGIC may correspond to the \"budding compartment\" of mouse coronavirus (Tooze et al., 1988; Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994) and to the \"pre-Golgi vacuoles\" of Semliki Forest virus-infected cells (Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984) . Isolation of the ERGIC from Vero cells indicated that this compartment has unique properties since it does not share major marker proteins with its direct neighbor organelles, the rough ER and cis-Golgi apparatus (Schweizer et al., 1991) . Currently, a limited number of marker proteins are available for the ERGIC. The ERGIC was originally defined by a 53-kD type I transmembrane protein (Schweizer et al., 1988) termed ERGIC-53. ERGIC-53 is specifically localized in the ERGIC at 37\u00b0C but undergoes a temperature-dependent redistribution (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990; Schweizer et al., 1990) which suggested that it may follow a recycling pathway (Hauri and Schweizer, 1992) . Another marker for the ERGIC is the small GTP-binding protein rab2p (Chavrier et al., 1990) . Beta-COP, a major component of non-clathrin-coated vesicles, also associates with the ERGIC at 15\u00b0C (Duden et al., 1991) . The p58-positive pre-Golgi elements described by Saraste and Svenson (1991) may also be part of the ERGIC.",

For eightwell multichamber slides 0.2/~g DNA in 100/~1 RNC plus DEAE-dextran was used in each well. The DNA solution was then replaced with PBS containing 10% DMSO, cells were incubated for 2 rain at room temperature, and washed with PBS before fresh medium was added. Cells were maintained at 37\"C and analyzed 43-48 h after transfection.",

The first construct to be prepared was a truncated form of p63 in which the amino-terminal residues 2-101 of the 106-amino acid-long p63 tail were deleted (A2-101, Fig. 3) . Since p63 has a type II membrane orientation, the first NH2-terminal amino acid representing the initiator methionine could not be removed. When A2-101 was expressed in COS cells, it was clearly present on the plasma membrane in about half of the transfected cells (Fig.  2 d) . Upon permeabilization, A2-101 was detected primarily in the rough ER as indicated by the reticular staining pattern along with labeling of the outer nuclear membrane (Fig. 2  c) . Occasionally it was found in the Golgi region or at the cell surface (see insert of Fig. 2 c for an example of surface staining). In the construction of A2-101, two arginine residues became positioned near the extreme NI-I2-terminus due to the deletion of 100 amino acids within the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 3) . We therefore considered the possibility that these positively charged amino acids might serve as an ERtargeting signal, thereby impairing the normal transport of the protein (Jackson et al., 1990) . These arginine residues (located in position -2 and -3 from the NH2 terminus of A2-101) were therefore changed to alanines (A2-101AA, Fig.  3 ) and the effect monitored by immunofluorescence as outlined above. A2-101AA showed strong cell surface expression over the entire transfected cell population (Fig. 2 f) . Further, the staining pattern observed in permeabilized cells (Fig. 2 e) was typical for a cell surface protein including juxtanuclear Golgi and plasma membrane staining. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of p63 is necessary for correct intracellular localization.",

When the NH~-terminal portion of p63 was extended to include the 23 NH2-terminal residues of the p63wt sequence (A24-101, Fig. 3) , the resultant protein behaved like p63wt when analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence after transfection (Fig. 4, c and d) . The mutant protein was completely retained inside the cell (Fig. 4 d) . In addition, the A24-101 staining in permeabilized ceils was indistinguishable from that ofp63wt (Fig. 4 c) , including cells that exhibit the striking tubular network that is typically found in p63wttransfected ceils (Fig. 4 c, inset) . We conclude from these results that the NH~-terminal 23 amino acid residues of the p63 cytoplasmic domain are required for proper intracellular localization. Deletion of amino acids 24-101 of the p63 tail, on the other hand, had no detectable effect on the distribution of p63 in the cell.",

The sequence contains an arginine-glycine combination at amino acid positions 7 and 8, and two pairs of lysine-glycine at positions 10 and 11, and 21 and 22, respectively. In addition, there is a single lysine residue present at amino acid position 5. The distribution of these residues relative to the amino acids altered in the overlapping alanine substitution experiments was consistent with these residues serving as components of a redundant retention signal. To test this possibility, K ~, R 7, G s, K 1\u00b0, G H, K 21, and G 22 in the ~24-101 sequence were simultaneously changed to aianines (Z~.4-101,KSRTGSKI\u00b0GnK2tGa2-A [MP1]; Fig. 7 ). Immunofluorescence analysis of this mutant expressed in COS cells revealed that it was highly expressed at the plasma membrane of non-permeab~ transfected cells (Fig. 8 b) . Furthermore, in permeabilized ceils transfected with MP1 the staining was also characteristic for a surface protein (Fig. 8 a) . The phenotype of MP1 is therefore very similar to that of the tailminus mutant A2-101AA. We next tested whether alunine substitutions of only the positively charged amino acids (K s, W, K 1\u00b0, and K29 (A24-101,KSRTK'\u00b0Ke~-A [MF2]; Fig. 7 ) or only the glycine residues (C_J, G n, and Cr n) (A94-101,CJG\"G22-A [MP3]; Fig. 7 ) present in the K-RG-KG-KG element would also disrupt p63 localization. Both constructs behaved similarly to A24-101 and p63wt as indicated by the lack of cell surface staining (Fig. 8 , d and f) and the typical internal pattern (Fig. 8, c and e). This demonstrated that changing positive charges or glycines alone does not affect retention of p63.",

Nontransfected control cells did not react with the anti-DPPIV mAb (data not shown) consistent with evidence that COS cells have tittle or no endogenous activity of DPPIV (Ogata et ai., 1992) . As shown in Fig. 10 , a and b DPPIVwt was located on the cell surface as expected. Bright cell surface staining was also observed for DPP (Fig. 10 d) . However, unlike DPPIVwt a portion of DPP was also found in the ER (Fig.  10 c) , indicating that the export of this chimeric protein out of the ER is impaired to some extent: Very rarely a cell showed a p63wt-related staining pattern. A similar result was obtained with a construct that only contained the lumenal domain of p63 (DDP; DPPIV cytoplasmic; DPPIV transmembrane, p63 lumenal; Fig. 9 ) except that most of the ER staining was now replaced by cell surface expression (data not shown). These results confirm that the p63 cytoplasmic tail is necessary for proper localization.

To this end, a chimeric construct in which the lumenal domain of p63 was replaced by that of DPPIV (PPD, p63 cytoplasmic, p63 transmembrane, DPPIV lumenal; Fig. 9 ) was created. In a related construct we linked the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of A24-101 to the DPPIV lumenal domain (A24-101PPD, p63 with deletion of amino acids 24-101 cyto- plasmic, p63 transmembrane, DPPIV lumenal; Fig. 9 ). When the subeellular localization of the chimeric proteins was analyzed in transfected COS cells, A24-101PPD showed the same distribution as DPPIVwt. There was strong labeling of the cell surface ( Fig. 10 f ) , but no internal staining with a p63wt pattern (Fig. 10 e) . The same was true for the PPD chimera (Fig. 10, g and h) except that the internal staining pattern included more ER staining in addition to the Golgi and cell surface staining predominantly found for DPPIVwt and A24-101PPD. These data demonstrate that the presence of the lumenal domain of the p63 molecule is essential for the correct localization of the protein.",

Immunofluorescence microscopy of transfected cells showed that the internal distribution of A24-101PDP is very similar to p63wt (Fig. 10 i) . Unlike p63wt, however, some A24-101PDP molecules were detected on the plasma membrane in unpermeabilized cells (Fig. 10 j) . The intensity of this cell surface staining was fainter than that of DPPIVwt or any of the other chimeric constructs.

Two findings in particular supported this idea. First, overexpression of p63 did not saturate the retention mechanism. And second, the p63 localization could not be transferred to another protein. We therefore speculated that individual 1363 molecules might interact with each other to form higher order structures. To test this hypothesis p63wt was analyzed by centrifugation. In this experiment COS cells transfected with p63wt were solubilized with Triton X-100 at different pHs (5.8, 6.3, 6.8, 7.4, and 8.0) and then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant and pellet fractions were then assayed for the presence of p63 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-p63 mAb. As shown in Fig. 11 A there was a pH dependent shift of 1363 from the soluble fraction to the pellet. At pH 8.0, p63 was equally distributed between the pellet and supernatant fractions, whereas increasing amounts of p63 were recovered in the COS cells transfected with p63wt were solubilized with Triton X-100 at the indicated pHs and then separated by centrifugation at 100,000 g into supernatant (S) and pellet (P). Proteins of the two fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% gels) and immunoblotring with an anti-p63 mAb. The numbers at the left margin of the blot indicate known molecular mass in kilodalton.

            "text": "Previous studies have established that p63 is stably retained between the rough ER and the Golgi apparatus (Schweizer et al., 1993a) . In the present study, we have analyzed the contribution of the individual p63 domains to retention by creating chimeric constructs with the type II plasma membrane protein DPPIV. The role of the cytoplasmic tail was further analyzed by deletions and point mutations within the p63 protein itself. The appearance of mutant p63 proteins at the cell surface and the concomitant loss of the characteristic p63wt internal staining pattern were used as criteria for loss of proper retention. Using these approaches, we have identiffed the domains of p63 that determine retention and obtained data that are consistent with the notion that oligomerization of p63 serves as a major retention mechanism. Table I presents a summary of all the constructs analyzed in this study. The striking characteristic of p63 retention is that no single topological domain is sufficient to specify retention. Rather, all three domains are required to achieve complete intracellular retention. The cytoplasmic and lumenal domains of p63 are most important for proper localization with the transmembrane domain playing a lesser role in this process. These findings with p63 differ from those obtained with most other proteins of the early secretory pathway where one domain has been shown to be sufficient for retention. In the case of resident lumenal ER proteins, the four-amino acid sequence KDEL at the carboxyl terminus serves as retrieval signal (Munro and Pelham, 1987; Pelham, 1989 Pelham, , 1990 . Similarly, KKXX/KXKXX elements at the carboxyl terminus of the cytoplasmic domains of type I transmembrane proteins function as retrieval signals (Nilsson et al., 1989; Jackson et al., 1990 Jackson et al., , 1993 . When transplanted onto marker proteins, these sequences are sufficient to cause retention in the ER. The carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 is also sufficient for localization of chimeric proteins to the TGN (Bos et al., 1993; Humphrey et al., 1993; Wong and Hong, 1993) . Other Golgi proteins are localized by means of their transmembrane domains (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (Burke et al., 1992; Tang et al., 1992) , galactosyltransferase (Nilsson et al., 1991; Aoki et al., 1992; Russo et al., 1992) , and the M glycoprotein of avian coronavirus (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Machamer et al., 1993) or in association with the cytoplasmic and lumenal flanking sequences (or 2,6-sialyltransferase (Munro, 1991; Dahdal and Colley, 1993) . The E1 glycoprotein of the mouse coronavirus is an exception among the proteins localized to the Golgi apparatus (Armstrong and Patel, 1991) . While a short deletion in the cytoplasmic tail destroyed retention, the cytoplasmic segmet~t alone was not sufficient for retention. Similar to the finding with p63, most of the sequence appeared to be required for proper localization.",

A potential clue emerged when we analyzed the solubility of the various constructs in the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. When transfected cells were solubilized with Triton X-100 at pH 6.5 and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g, the proteins that were properly retained (p63wt, A24-101, MP2, and MP3) were predominantly found in the pellet fraction whereas the nonretained proteins (A2-101AA and MP1) were mostly recovered in the supernatant. Endogenous p63 from COS cells was exclusively found in the 100,000 g pellet, demonstrating that the property is not a function of transfection and/or overexpression. While the extent of Triton X-100-insolubility of p63wt increased with decreasing pH, most of the protein was insoluble at pH 7.4, which is similar to the pH of the cytoplasm. Since highly purified p63wt exhibited the same pHdependent insolubility in Triton X-100, we conclude that this behavior is an intrinsic property of the protein. This does not exclude the possibility that p63 also interacts with other resi-dent proteins of the compartment or with cytoplasmic elements, such as members of the cytoskeleton.",

The model predicts that upon arrival at their final destination, p63 molecules encounter an environment that leads to self aggregation resulting in the formation of large oligomers. The specific conditions that might trigger the oligomerization of p63 are unknown, but could include differences in ion composition, lumenal pH or properties of the local membrane. This proposed retention mechanism is compatible with several additional findings. First, high levels of expression do not result in mislocalization of p63 to the plasma membrane, indicating that the p63 retention system is not saturable. If p63 interacted with a specific receptor, overexpression would likely lead to saturation of the retention machinery and the appearance of the protein at the cell surface. Second, as mentioned above, all three domains of p63 are necessary for complete retention, as would be expected if the molecule formed higher order structures. When Triton X-100-soluble p63 molecules were examined by sucrose gradient centrifugation or nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the majority of the molecules were present as noncovalently linked dimers (Schweizer et al., 1993a; Schweizer, A., J. Rohrer, and S. Kornfeld, unpublished data) . Interestingly, this dimerization of p63 is independent on the cytoplasmic tail, in contrast to the formation of higher oligomeric complexes.",

            "text": "Taken together, the most straightforward interpretation of our results is as follows. The lumenal domains of individual p63 molecules interact to form noncovalently linked dimers, with the transmembrane domains possibly having an accessory role. These dimers would represent the basic unit from which higher oligomeric structures are built. Upon reaching their final destination, larger complexes form, requiring interactions of the cytoplasmic tails as well as the lumenal and transmembrane domains. The amino-terminal 23 residues of the cytoplasmic tails could either be directly involved in the interactions or, more likely, guarantee a conformation of the cytoplasmic tail that favors higher order assembly. The association of p63 into large complexes could prevent p63 molecules from entering budding vesicles and thereby provide a mechanism for retention. Alternatively, failure of the mutant p63 molecules to form the higher order complexes would result in leakage of the molecules out of the compartment with eventual delivery to the cell surface. This proposed model for the localization of p63 involves a retention rather than a retrieval mechanism, which is compatible with previous data suggesting that p63 is a stably anchored resident protein.",

The only example where retention in this organelle has actually been correlated with oligomerization is a chimeric membrane protein in which the membrane-spanning domain of VSV G protein was replaced with the first membrane-spanning domain of the M glycoprotein of avian coronavirus (Weisz et al., 1993) . However, in contrast to the chimera, oligomerization of the intact M glycoprotein could not be demonstrated. Recently, Nilsson et al. (1993 Nilsson et al. ( , 1994 have proposed a model whereby Golgi enzymes form homo-dimers in which the lumenal domains are bound together while the transmembrane domains interact with those of identical or related enzymes of the same Golgi cisternae to form hetero-oligomers. The cytoplasmic domains would be attached to an underlying matrix to stabilize larger arrays. Although similar in the overall architecture, this Golgi model differs from the model supported by the p63 data in several ways. In particular, the domains responsible for the formation of higher order structures (cytoplasmic tail versus transmembrane domain) and the kind of oligomers formed (homo-versus hetero-oligomers) are distinct. Taken together, oligomerization is likely to be a general mechanism that specifies location of proteins in different compartments of the secretory pathway. Oligomerization per se, however, seems to be achievable by different mechanisms and forms of interactions.",
