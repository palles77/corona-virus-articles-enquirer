Outside cells, they exist as independent particles (i.e. virions) generally composed of a protein shell (sometimes covered with a lipid bilayer) that contains their genetic material made of RNA or DNA. Virus genome replication and transcription are catalyzed by virally encoded polymerases. Although all these enzymes show some homology and share structural features and their catalytic mechanism, they also have important differences that reflect diverse virus replication strategies.",

These viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) that share with eukaryotic DNA polymerases the characteristic fingers-palm-thumb subdomain arrangement. However, they show unique extensive interactions between the fingers and thumb subdomains that contribute to the formation of a well-defined template channel (Peersen, 2017; Lu and Gong, 2017) . The poliovirus polymerase is the smallest viral polymerase and recent studies have been focused on how to modulate its fidelity of RNA synthesis, as a potential strategy to use in the development of attenuated vaccines (Peersen, 2017) . Norovirus polymerases share a very similar structure, and it has received attention as a target of drugs currently in development. In their review, Deval et al., 2017 discuss on nucleoside analogues (e.g. ribavirin, favipiravir, 2\u2032-C-methyl-cytidine) and nonnucleoside RdRp inhibitors (e.g. suramin) active in vitro against the human norovirus polymerase.",
