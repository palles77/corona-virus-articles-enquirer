Chest radiographs showed newly developed consolidative opacity. His fever persisted for 3 days after commencing empirical antibiotics. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed focal patchy airspace consolidation and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in a subpleural lesion of the right lower and left upper lobes, which was indicative of organizing pneumonia. We initiated empirical corticosteroid treatment for this illness, and his fever markedly subsided 1 day later. A chest radiograph showed improvement in the lung lesions, and he was discharged from the hospital 10 days after re-admission. The corticosteroid dose was gradually tapered over 2 months at the outpatient clinic, and a follow-up CT scan showed complete resolution of the consolidation and GGOs.",

Over 1,700 laboratoryconfirmed cases from 27 countries were detected, and approximately 36% of patients have died due to a MERS-CoV infection since 2012 (10) . Previous studies have indicated that men have a higher infection rate of MERS-CoV compared to women, with a median age of 56-62 years (11, 12) . The majority of patients were infected by person-to-person transmission in healthcare facilities or households (11) (12) (13) , with a median incubation period of 5.2 days (12) . Fever, cough, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Most fatal cases were frequently associated with significant comorbidities such as obesity, renal disease, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, lung disease, and immunosuppressive conditions. In these cases, almost all of the patients developed pneumonia and more than 70% required admission to the intensive care unit, requiring ventilator care (11) (12) (13) .",

Several studies have reported that the radiologic features of MERS are usually non-specific and are similar to those of pneumonia from other causes (13) (14) (15) . These radiological features may progress from mild unilateral focal lesions to acute respiratory distress syndrome and extensive multifocal or bilateral involvement in severe cases. However, another study reported that some patients with MERS-CoV infection have a predominance of patchy air-space opacities and more extensive GGOs than consolidations in the subpleural lung, and often in the lower lung zone on a CT scan, suggestive of an organizing pneumonia (8) . Several animal model studies have reported that organizing pneumonia is not uncommon in animals with a MERS-CoV infection (16, 17) . Although we could not pathologically confirm organizing pneumonia due to the patient's bleeding tendency, his lung lesions probably reflected organizing pneumonia because a marked clinical and radiological response was achieved soon after commencing the corticosteroid treatment. In addition, CT imaging features of organizing pneumonia are characteristic and the diagnostic accuracy of CT for organizing pneumonia is high (79%) (18) .",
