Of these viruses, the antigenic relationship between TGE and FIP viruses is especially strong (Pedersen et al., 1978) . Because of this strong antigenic relationship, it is logical to assume that infection with one virus might confer protection against infection with the other virus. Preliminary studies suggest that TGE virus will not protect cats against FIP virus infection (Witte et al., 1977) , but no information is available on the protective effect of FIP virus vaccination on baby pigs and pregnant gilts infected with virulent TGE virus.",

            "text": "The phenomena described in this report appears similar to that reported in swine with the Pestiviruses (bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) and hog cholera (HC)). The BVD--HC virus complex appears to be related to the strain of BVD immunizing virus and the Ames challenge strain of HC virus (Snowdon and French, 1968; Stewart et al., 1971) . In unpublished studies using agar gel diffusion, at least one antigen shared by TGE and FIP was soluble. However, because this is a preliminary report and only one strain of FIP virus was used, much additional information needs to be generated to clarify the TGE--FIP complex.",
