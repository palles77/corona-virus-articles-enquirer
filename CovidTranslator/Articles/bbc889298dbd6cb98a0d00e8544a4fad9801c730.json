Patients undergoing rhinological procedures should be informed about olfactory loss as a potential risk of surgery.

Any dysfunction of this special sense can be a major source of emotional stress to the patient [1] . The basic survival mechanism of the sense of smell alerts individuals to the presence of harmful environmental pollutants, smoke, and toxins. A healthy sense of smell also enables one to enjoy fine wines and gourmet food. Most patients with an olfactory dysfunction complain that they have ''altered taste'' when, in fact, they have a smell dysfunction. Up to 80% of a meal's flavor is due to olfactory input. Patients who sustain an injury to the olfactory system are no longer able to distinguish the subtle flavors that are characteristic of coffee, chocolate, strawberry, or root beer. Biologically, taste is only the sensation of five qualities: saltiness, bitterness, sweetness, sourness, and umami (monosodium glutamate).The goal of this article is to provide the facial plastic surgeon with an under-standing of the anatomy and physiology of the olfactory and gustatory systems and with practical information about diagnostic tests and therapies that are currently available.",

The trigeminal nerve has receptors for pungent odorants throughout the nasal and pharyngeal cavities. The glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves provide the minor chemosensory function in the pharyngeal area. The ciliated olfactory receptors are part of the olfactory neuroepithelium. From the nostril, these nerves are located 7 cm inside each nasal cavity. They branch from beneath the right and left cribriform plates (Figs. 1 and 2) and cover approximately 2 cm 2 on each side of the nasal cavity. The olfactory region includes the superior nasal septum, superior/supreme turbinate, superior -lateral nasal wall, and sections of the middle turbinate [2, 3] . The cell bodies of the primary olfactory neurons are located within the nasal mucosa. The bundles of axons from these neurons (filia olfactoria) go up through the 15 to 20 foramina in the cribriform plate to synapse in the olfactory bulb (see Figs. 1 and 2) .",

Visible in 91% to 97% of healthy adults, it opens to the nasal vestibule through an orifice (diameter: 1.02 mm) 2 cm posterior from the nostril at the junction of the bony and cartilaginous septum. The VNO was previously considered a rudimentary organ because it has no neural connec- tion to the brain. However, local electrophysiological responses have been recorded, and recent studies [5] demonstrate that the VNO system may mediate some autonomic, psychological, and endocrine responses. It is still possible that it could function to perceive pheromonal odorants, as occurs in other animals. Hence, it is prudent to avoid injury to this organ during nasal surgery.",

Approximately 10% to 20% of the airflow through the nasal cavity moves through the olfactory cleft [6] . Once the odorant chemical reaches the wall of the olfactory mucosa, it must adhere to it and dissolve in the mucus overlying that mucosa. More soluble chemicals penetrate more rapidly and effectively than less soluble ones. The chemical information is transformed into an electrical action potential. Activation of the olfactory receptors by means of G-protein and possibly cAMP intracellular messengers triggers depolarization and conduction of the signal along the axons. The signal is then propagated to the olfactory bulb and ascends ipsilaterally to the amygdala and primary sensory cortex. The process of odor identification is not well understood, but is clearly related to the number of receptors available for stimulation. Once an odor has been identified, multiple associations to time-and place-related memories can be made (eg, cinnamon and apple smells associated with Christmas). The olfactory memory, along with association areas, is stored in the medial anterior temporal lobes of the brain.",

Champion [9] reviewed 200 rhinoplasties: 22 patients (10%) had temporary anosmia lasting 6 to 18 months after surgery, and one case lasted more than 3 years. No olfactory testing was used with this study; hence, the accuracy of these reports is unclear. Goldwyn and Shore [10] evaluated 97 patients before and after nasal surgery and found three patients (3%) with decreased postoperative olfactory ability. No long-term (greater than 2 months) olfactory loss was identified, however. In this study, no statistical analysis was performed, and testing was done using only three odorants presented to each nostril separately in open bottles. Stevens and Stevens [11] evaluated 100 patients undergoing septoplasty, septorhinolasty, turbinoplasty, polypectomy, and Caldwell-Luc. In eight patients (8%), the olfactory ability decreased, and one patient (1%) became anosmic. Briner et al [12] followed 184 patients who underwent sinus surgery, septoplasty, and rhinoplasty for 6 months. The Smell Diskettes Test and questionnaire were used as evaluating tools. Nineteen patients (10.3%) had impaired sense of smell preoperatively. Following surgery, four patients (2.5%) who had had normal preoperative sense of smell developed hyposmia. Six patients with preoperative hyposmia had improvement of sense of smell after surgery (two patients after septoplasty, two after sinus surgery, one after rhinoplasty, and one in the group of other operations). No patient developed anosmia. Kimmelman [13] tested 93 patients before and after nasal surgery that included ethmoidectomy, polypectomy, Caldwell-Luc, open-and closed-reduction of the nasal fracture, septoplasty, and rhinoplasty. For preand postoperative olfactory function testing, the author used the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). He found that 66% of patients had improvement or no change in the UPSIT scores. Thirty-four percent had a decline in their UPSIT score, but this decline was minimal. The study concluded that the risk of anosmia after nasal surgery was low at 1.1%. Kimmelman [13] proposed several mechanisms of injury to olfactory function from sinonasal surgery. We have modified this scheme according to our current understanding (Table 1) .",

Fractures in the frontal region are most commonly associated with olfactory losses, with occipital trauma being the second most common cause. Post-traumatic olfactory dysfunction can be the result of (1) shearing injury of the olfactory nerve axons, (2) brain contusion and hemorrhage in the olfactory regions, and (3) sinonasal tract alternation. The usual course of injury to olfactory function is an immediate onset, but it can also be delayed until months after the initial injury [16, 17] . In 10% of cases olfactory function returns, but it is usually diminished.

Most patients with chemosensory deficits complain of taste alteration. Upon closer inquiry patients admit that they are still able to taste sweet, bitter, sour and salt, but complain that the food does not have any flavor. Perception of flavor therefore is lost mostly because of the olfactory damage, not a gustatory disorder. It is important to estimate the degree of olfactory loss and its duration. The examiner should inquire about events that occurred around the time of the initial loss, such as head trauma, exposure to toxins or fumes, or URI. Unilateral epistaxis or obstruction gives rise to the suspicion of sinonasal tumor. A fluctuating sense of smell is common in patients with rhinosinusitis and polyposis. Attention should also be paid to a history of sinus problems, allergies, nasal obstruction, visual changes, central nervous system complaints, delayed puberty, or endocrine abnormalities (hypothyroidism). Past medical history should be reviewed for occupational exposure and cigarette smoke. The patient's current medications and the ones used at the time of the onset of olfactory dysfunction also need to be reviewed, because many of them can affect the olfactory and gustatory function. Some examples include adrenal steroids, amino acids in excess (eg, cysteine or histidine), antimicrobials (neomycin, penicillins, macrolids), antithyroidals (methimazole, thiouracil), opiates (codeine, morphine), and cardiovascular and antihypertensive medications [25] . Usually, olfactory function will return after the medication is discontinued, but sometimes the change can be permanent. Inquiry should be made about signs of early dementia, Parkinson's disease, depression, or schizophrenia.",

During the nasal endoscopy, attention should focus on the patency of the olfactory cleft and middle meatus and the presence of the airspace between the middle turbinate and septum, especially in the superior portion toward the olfactory cleft.

Gustatory testing will be discussed in the Taste Disorders section. Most olfactory testing relies on measuring detection thresholds of a specific odorant or the ability to identify multiple odorants [29] . The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is the most widely used test. It consists of four ''scratch and sniff'' booklets, each containing 10 microencapsulated odorants. The test is self-administered and usually takes 15 to 20 minutes to complete. The UPSIT has been extensively studied and validated for age and gender [30] . Test protocols also help to identify malingerers. The reliability of the test is very high, and it has versions available for many cultures [31] . The UPSIT can be used to assess a patient's olfactory ability before and after treatment and to follow disease progression. In Europe, a popular test uses odorant-impregnated felt tip pens (Sniffin'Sticks) for threshold and odorant identification. It is a forced-choice test that is easy to administer and can be reused [32, 33] . A simple olfactory screening test using a 70% isopropyl alcohol pad as a stimulant has recently been described [34] . With the patient's eyes closed, the alcohol pad is brought gradually toward the patient's nose. The patient reports the moment when he or she can detect the odor, and the distance from the nares to the pad is measured. The distance correlates with the degree of olfactory loss. The test also makes it possible to differentiate between unilateral and bilateral losses and between hyposmia and anosmia.",

There is no effective medical therapy or intervention for a neural olfactory loss. In patients with olfactory dysfunction secondary to nasal obstruction, the treatment is directed toward restoring the airflow to the olfactory cleft. Treatment with nasal corticosteroids, decongestants, antibiotics, allergy medications, allergy immunotherapy, and saline irrigations may be helpful. Application of topical nasal steroids in the head down and forward position may be especially helpful with olfactory cleft blockage [37] . Many publications suggest that various vitamins and minerals such as zinc, vitamin A, and vitamin B will help with olfactory disorders, but there have been no statistically valid, controlled studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of these therapies. A trial of 1-month therapy with a large dose of oral steroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day) might be helpful in the patient with recent olfactory loss.",

However, in patients with CRS, no study has been able to document an association between olfactory test scores and intranasal airway access based on rhinoscopy, rhinometry, or acoustic rhinometry, except in cases of total or near-total blockage [4] . Patients with intranasal or intracranial tumors may benefit from surgical excision or combined therapy with chemo-radiation, depending on the pathology of the process. Severe cases of phantosmia have been treated with craniotomy and bilateral bulbectomy. This type of surgery alleviates the phantosmia but also results in anosmia [43] . A more conservative approach involves endoscopic excision of the olfactory mucosa from the bottom of the cribriform plate on the affected side. It provides relief to the patient with possible preservation of some olfactory function [23, 24, 44] .",

Circumvallate papillae are raised circular structures located in the posterior tongue and innervated by the glossopharyngeal cranial nerve IX.

Viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections of the oral and hypopharyngeal mucosa may lead to disturbance of taste. Radiationinduced mucositis may also cause impairment. Poor oral hygiene can cause distortion of taste. The aging process adversely affects the sense of taste, but to a lesser degree than it does the sense of smell. Bitter and sour tastes are most likely to diminish with age, but the loss is generally only partial [45] . Neoplastic involvement of the floor of the mouth, submandibular space, or infratemporal fossa may produce a loss of taste. Smoking may have an adverse effect on taste sensitivity and discrimination. Injury to the chorda tympani can also occur secondary to ear surgery or infections like chronic otitis media, Bell's palsy, Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, and Lyme disease. Patients with chorda tympani injuries actually complain of phantom taste (metallic, sometimes salty or bitter) more frequently than they do of complete loss of taste [46] . Trauma to the lingual or pharyngeal branches of cranial nerve IX during tonsillectomy or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty can also result in taste dysfunction. Pathologic involvement of nerves IX and X in glomus tumors, squamous cell carcinoma, or schwannoma, together with other neurologic deficits, will produce a loss of taste. Head injury rarely causes a loss of taste, with a reported incidence of 0.4% to 0.5% [47] . Some systemic diseases have been associated with a loss of smell or phantom smell. Renal disease may produce a phantom taste (metallic or bitter), which is most likely secondary to accumulation of uremic toxins, because improvement occurs after dialysis [48] . Patients with diabetes may experience taste disturbances as a consequence of related neuropathies.",

Evaluation of chemosensory ability should include assessment of the quality and intensity of taste. The taste qualities can be affected to different degrees, and each needs to be tested separately. Typically, the following stimuli are used to test four taste qualities: NaCl (salty), sucrose (sweet), citric acid (sour), and quinine hydrochloride or coffee (bitter). Taste function in various areas of the tongue and oral cavity can be measured using a spatial test. The three-drop technique involves placing three drops of a given chemical on a random portion of the tongue. The concentration is titrated to obtain the threshold of sensitivity. Recently, several tests have been developed in Germany that resemble this technique but are more standardized in the form of ''taste strips,'' wafers or tablets with specific concentrations of the stimuli. Some allow testing of the whole mouth, while others facilitate testing of each side of the tongue separately [49 -51] .",

Topical anesthesia applied to the tongue or mouth can also eliminate taste that is due to the presence of genuine tastant or peripheral taste dysfunction. The source of the genuine tastant could be saliva, laryngopharyngeal reflux, or sinonasal drainage.

Obtaining a detailed history and physical examination is the key to diagnosis and work-up of the olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Understanding that most patients' ''taste'' complaints are actually symptoms of an olfactory dysfunction is essential. Distinguishing between true gustatory loss (the inability to perceive bitter, sweet, salty, sour, and umami) and olfactory loss (the inability to perceive complex flavors of food) will help clarify the patient's diagnosis. Easyto-administer tests are available for olfactory evaluation (UPSIT) and gustatory evaluation (modified three-drops testing: taste sticks, tasting tablets). The prognosis and management of the olfactory and gustatory disease depend on its cause. Olfactory loss due to obstructive causes is amenable to treatment. Central losses are usually not treatable. True gustatory dysfunction is rare. In some cases, identifying and eliminating causative factors such as infection and inflammation may alleviate the taste dysfunction. For most patients with taste and smell disorders, no effective therapies are available. Psychological support and environmental protection play important roles under these circumstances.",

Atrophic rhinitis secondary to aggressive resection of the sinonasal tissue, especially inferior turbinectomy, which can lead to excessive crusting, dryness and mechanical occlusion of the olfactory cleft by crust. Airflow modifiers: Scarring or anatomical narrowing/widening that would alter airflow to the upper nasal olfactory neuroepithelium. Vascular/neural injury: Vascular compromise to the olfactory neuroepithelium secondary to surgically created ischemia. URI in early post-operative period (Herpes, influenza, Rhino and Corona viruses are known to affect the olfactory pathway). Other: Medications: 1. Local anesthetics applied either topically or injected 2. Topical Zinc products Psychological factors: anxiety, stress which may lead to the complaints of olfactory dysfunction. Unrecognized preexisting anosmia/hyposmia. Loss of major areas of healthy olfactory epithelium with only few functioning areas that still give ''normal'' olfactory function.",
