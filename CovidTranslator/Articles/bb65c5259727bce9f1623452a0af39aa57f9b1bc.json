            "text": "In the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbations have a significant impact on mortality, 1 especially in those who require hospital admission. Indeed, exacerbations become more frequent and more severe as the severity of COPD increases. 2 Although exacerbations have multiple causes, an infectious etiology is by far the most frequent, with figures up to 78% for hospital-admitted COPD patients. 3 Bacterial infections account for one-half of the acute episodes, while respiratory viruses are identified in more than one-quarter, with rhinovirus (RV) and influenza being the most commonly detected viral pathogens. Microbiological studies Dovepress Dovepress 2634 gallego et al have identified change in sputum color and purulence as good surrogate markers for bacterial infection, 4, 5 while the detection of viruses in exacerbations is only marginally associated with the appearance of changes in the characteristics of sputum. 6, 7 Both respiratory bacteria and viruses are able to produce major local and systemic inflammatory responses, and biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) have been extensively studied and used as an alternative test to diagnose bacterial infections in both COPD and pneumonia. 8, 9 Likewise, in stable COPD, CRP levels have been examined as a marker of bacterial colonization and/or subclinical infection 10 but in studies of exacerbated COPD patients, including viral etiology, they have proven unable to distinguish virus-associated exacerbations from others. 7 In fact, a recent study by Clark et al demonstrated a higher level of CRP in exacerbations due to viruses than in those with positive cultures for bacteria. 11 Few studies have evaluated the usefulness of CRP as a predictor of the severity of acute episodes. Studies that have suggested that high CRP levels are a marker of exacerbation in COPD have not demonstrated its value for the identification of episodes severe enough to require admission. 12 In severe COPD outpatients, studies of CRP are scarce, and the relationship between microorganisms and the severity of exacerbations is not fully understood.",

Viruses were identified from 45 of the 98 samples with negative cultures for bacteria (45.9%) and from 51 of the 167 exacerbations with cultures showing bacterial infection (30.5%), which were accordingly considered as coinfections. In these episodes, the relationships between bacterial type and viruses detected did not show statistical significance (P=0.9). Seasonal virus distribution demonstrated a higher prevalence of virus infections during fall and winter.

These data are similar to those obtained in other studies that have focused on patients requiring hospitalization due to the severity of the episode, 26, 27 suggesting that this etiologic pattern characterizes severe COPD exacerbations. H. influenzae was the most frequently recovered bacteria in the present study and was the cause of one-quarter of the CRP levels in peripheral blood were clearly related to the etiology of the exacerbation in the study population, with the highest figures for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and a statistically significant relationship between bacterial load and blood levels of this inflammatory marker for S. pneumoniae. The systemic impact of this PPM has been assessed in patients with pneumonia; it is related to severity and prognosis 9,28 and is determined by a host-pathogen interaction favored by the C-polysaccharide of the pneumococcal cell wall. 29 The inflammatory power of H. influenzae in the bronchial tree is well known and has been related to microbial load, 10 but the systemic effect of this PPM has been studied only marginally. The present results confirm that bronchial infections due to H. influenzae have a clear systemic effect in severe COPD patients, as measured by CRP levels in peripheral blood, equivalent to the effect found in S. pneumoniae-related exacerbations. This finding is clinically significant, because H. influenzae is the most prevalent cause of exacerbation in these patients; infections by H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the cause of nearly one-half of the episodes. In contrast, virus detection was associated with lower CRP levels and severity. Our results are at odds with those of previous studies that have reported higher levels of serum CRP in patients with virus-induced exacerbations. 6, 11 The differences are probably due to the characteristics of the episodes reported here, consisting of exacerbations that appear in the follow-up of a cohort of severe COPD outpatients. Previous studies have focused on severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization and have thus missed milder episodes that may be partially related to viruses and probably evolve with lower CRP levels.",

In fact, a cutoff .100 mg/L has been associated with adverse outcomes 28 and demonstrated a predictive ability for selecting patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 31 Similar values of CRP have been reported in COPD exacerbations for selecting patients requiring ICU admission, although the number of patients included (n=64) was too small to draw conclusions. 32 Our study also underlined the importance of baseline hypercapnia as a marker of severity in acute episodes, in agreement with previous studies that have associated this abnormality with survival. 33 Baseline hypercapnia doubled the risk of hospital admission and it seems reasonable to think that it identified a subgroup of more frail patients, at least in our cohort.",
