Nsp10 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) displays an apparent molecular mass of 13-16 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE and analytical gel filtration, while dynamic light scattering suggests the existence of oligomeric forms. Atomic absorption spectroscopy reveals two metal ions per Nsp10 monomer, with a preference for Zn 2+ over Fe 2+/3+ and Co 2+ . These are probably bound by two Zn-finger-like motifs. Moreover, MHV Nsp10 interacts with tRNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded DNA and, to a lesser extent, singlestranded DNA as shown by gel-shift experiments. The K d for tRNA is 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 lM.",

            "text": "Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is a positive-strand RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae that possess genomes of approx. 31 300 nucleotides. MHV has been taxonomically assigned to coronavirus group 2 and is thus a phylogenic neighbour of SARS coronavirus [1] , the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (see, e.g., [2] for review). Depending on the strain, MHV can cause hepatitis, encephalitis and demyelinating encephalomyelitis in susceptible rodents [3] and the virus has been used as a model system for infection of the central nervous system (CNS) [4] and virus-induced autoimmune reactions in the CNS [5] . Coronavirus genomes contain up to 15 open reading frames encoding both structural and non-structural proteins [6, 7] . From the largest open read-ing frames, 1a and 1b, two polyproteins are translated, pp1a ($500 kDa) and pp1ab ($800 kDa), the latter originating from a (\u00c01)-ribosomal frameshift occurring in the short overlap region of orf 1a and orf 1b. The two MHV polyproteins are cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins [8] by two papain-like proteinases, PL1 pro and PL2 pro , which are part of Nsp3 [9] , and by the main proteinase (M pro , Nsp5), which is frequently also called 3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ) [10, 11] . Most or all of the 16 non-structural proteins are proposed to be part of the replicase-transcriptase complex, probably mediating all functions necessary for polyprotein processing, viral transcription, and replication [6] . After translation and processing, MHV non-structural proteins form replication complexes that are thought to be associated with multilayered membrane structures [12] or double-membrane vesicles [13] . Most MHV replicase subunits were found to co-localize in discrete foci in the perinuclear region of the infected cell [12] [13] [14] [15] . Dual-labelling studies demonstrated co-localization of, e.g. Nsp8 with the helicase (Nsp13), the nucleocapsid protein, the main proteinase (Nsp5), Nsp7, 9, and 10 [15] . Moreover, Nsp1 specifically binds to Nsp7 and Nsp10 as shown by yeast-two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments [16] . These examples of interactions between coronavirus Nsps are likely to be the tip of an iceberg of protein-protein interactions that drive the formation of the replication-transcription complex and, probably, are critical to its function. In temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV-A59 [7] , mutations assigned to Nsp4, 5, 10, 12, 14, and 16 are responsible for a variety of defects in RNA synthesis. Therefore, these proteins are assumed to be essential components of the replicase-transcriptase and to fulfil distinct functions in negative-and/or positive-strand RNA synthesis.",

This value agreed well with the molecular mass deduced from the amino-acid sequence (15.4 kDa) . Owing to the hexahistidine tag, the Nsp10 could be readily detected in immunoblots using an anti-tetrahistidine antibody (Fig. 2B ).

In contrast, dynamic light scattering of Nsp10 revealed several different states of oligomerization, depending on the conditions applied (Fig. 4) . In the absence of metal ion supplements, but with 20 mM glutathione present, the protein solution (2.8 mg/ml) showed a monodisperse peak at a Stokes radius of 9 nm (Fig. 4A) . Assuming the corresponding Nsp10 oligomer to be spherical, a molecular mass of around 600 kDa, corresponding to higher-order aggregates, can be calculated from this. Nsp10 + Zn, Nsp10 + Co, and Nsp10 + Fe samples tended to be polydisperse (Figs. 4B-D) and the intensity of the peaks decreased. The following main peaks were observed in these samples: Nsp10 + Zn at 3.9 and 38 nm (corresponding to an 80 kDa and to a very large aggregate, respectively); Nsp10 + Co at 6 nm (223 kDa), and Nsp10 + Fe at 2.4 nm (24.2 kDa). The cobalt-supplemented protein displayed the most polydisperse distribution among these DLS measurements. Interestingly, when double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were added to the Nsp10 + Zn solution, all indications of an oligomeric association state vanished and a clear, monodisperse signal at a Stokes radius of 2.0 nm, corresponding to a 16.3 kDa Nsp10 monomer, was observed (Fig. 4E) .

            "text": "We have shown in this study that Nsp10 of mouse hepatitis virus binds nucleic acids and metal ions, with a clear preference for zinc over iron and cobalt. The observed stoichiometry is $2 Zn 2+ per Nsp10 monomer. Even when cobalt or iron are added in excess to the expression medium, most of the bound metal is zinc, suggesting that zinc ions bind to Nsp10 under physiological conditions of expression in infected cells. A sequence alignment of coronaviral Nsp10 proteins shows that nine of the ten cysteine residues of MHV Nsp10 are strictly conserved in all three coronavirus groups (Fig. 7) . Within its C-terminal half, the motif C74-X 2 -C77-X 5 -H83-X 6 -C90 is found, which could constitute a classical zinc finger of the CCHC type. Residue His83 of this motif is also absolutely conserved throughout the coronaviruses. This motif is followed by a second potential zinc finger displaying the sequence C116-X 2 -C119-X 7 -C127-X-C129, which would belong to the CCCC type. The presence of more than one zinc finger is quite common in transcription factors. However, we cannot exclude that the conserved Cys residues 17 and 41 of the N-terminal part of Nsp10 may also be involved in complexation of Zn 2+ , even though they do not match with one of the canonical zinc binding motifs. Cys45 is the only cysteine residue in MHV Nsp10 that is not conserved throughout the Coronaviridae, and is therefore unlikely to be involved in metal ion binding. The presumable Zn-fingers of Nsp10 may function in binding double-stranded RNA. Interestingly, this would make Nsp10 the fourth member of an array of small RNA-binding proteins encoded by the 3 0 -part of coronavirus replicase orf 1a. Recent structural and biochemical studies showed that also Nsp9 [22, 23] (R. Ponnusamy, JRM, RM, and RH, unpublished) and a hexadecameric complex formed by Nsp7 and Nsp8 [24] have RNA-binding properties. These proteins were postulated to be accessory factors for the RdRp complex, a role that would also be in line with the phenotype of the MHV Nsp10 temperature-sensitive mutant (Gln65 fi Glu) recently characterized by Sawicki and colleagues [7] .",

We also showed that binding of Nsp10 to double-stranded DNA leads to dissociation of Nsp10 oligomers, as evident from dynamic light scattering. Zinc fingers are known to be occasionally involved in protein-protein interactions. Therefore, nucleic-acid binding to the presumable zinc fingers of Nsp10 could compete with oligomerization of the protein through these structural features, although we cannot exclude that this could also be due to other interactions. This investigation into the biochemical properties of MHV Nsp10 will add to the functional and structural studies that are currently underway.",
