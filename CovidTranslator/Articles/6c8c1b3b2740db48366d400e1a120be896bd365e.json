Suspicion of COVID-19 led to her direct transfer to the Lapland Central Hospital in Rovaniemi, where she was isolated and sampled on 28 and 29 January for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 1 ). SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed from nasopharyngeal samples on 29 January by the Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory (HUSLAB), and further confirmed at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) ( Table) . Both laboratories performed real-time RT-PCR testing for three targets: the envelope (E), the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the nucleocapsid (N). Primers and probes were based on the Corman et al. method [2] . Cycle threshold (Ct) values above 37 were considered negative.",

The SARS-CoV-2 CPEbased MN test using live virus appeared to be very specific, while laborious to conduct requiring a BSL-3 laboratory. An increase of at least 4-fold in the neutralising antibodies indicating a positive response was detected at Day 9-10 after the first symptoms and at Day 20, the antibody levels were still increasing. Our findings indicate that the MN assay is specific for functional SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and could be applied in surveillance of population immunity for this virus.",
