More than 50 serotypes have been recognized; however, the exact association of serotype with clinical phenotype is still unclear. There have been no reports on the adenovirus serotype pattern in Hong Kong, and their relationships with disease manifestations and complications are not known. Clinical and epidemiological data on 287 children (<6 years old) admitted with adenovirus respiratory infections from 2001 to 2004 were reviewed. Common presenting symptoms included fever (97.9 %) and cough and rhinitis (74 %). Extra-pulmonary manifestations were present in 37.3 %. The clinical picture mimicked bacterial infection for its prolonged high fever and neutrophilic blood picture. Forty-two patients (14.6 %) had LRTI, either pneumonia or acute bronchiolitis, but none had severe acute respiratory compromise. Children aged 1 to 2 years old were most at risk for adenovirus LRTI (adjusted p=0.0165). Serotypes 1 to 7 could be identified in 93.7 % of the nasopharyngeal specimens, with serotypes 2 and 3 being the most prevalent. Different serotypes showed predilection for different age groups and with different respiratory illness association. The majority of acute bronchiolitis (71.4 %) were associated with serotype 2 infection, and this association was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Serotype 3 infection accounted for over half of the pneumonia cases (57-75 %) in those aged 3-5 years old. Only one patient developed mild bronchiectasis after serotype 7 pneumonia. Children aged 1 to 2 years old were the at-risk group for adenovirus LRTI, but respiratory morbidity was relatively mild in our locality. There was an apparent serotype-respiratory illness association.",

The culture maintenance fluid, minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 % fetal bovine serum (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY, USA), L-glutamine (2 mM), and antimicrobials (final antimicrobial concentration per milliliter of medium: vancomycin, 50 \u03bcg; amikacin, 20 \u03bcg; nystatin, 20 units), was changed every 2 to 3 days or twice during the incubation period. Ad was identified initially by characteristic cytopathic effect and direct immunofluorescence staining (Adenovirus DFA Reagent, EMD Millipore Corporation, USA) of the infected cells. Definitive typing of the viral isolate was performed by micro-neutralization assay with HEp-2C cells for serotyping as described previously [16] . The isolate was passed to a new HEp2-C tube until \u226575 % cytopathic effect was evident and diluted the culture at 1:10 with 2 % minimum essential medium after freezing and thawing of the culture once before carrying out the neutralization test. Briefly, 0.05 ml of each Ad typing serum type 1 to 7 (Denka Seiken, Japan) at 10-20 antibody unit per 0.05 ml was added to 0.05 ml of each isolate at a viral concentration of 100 TCID 50 (50 % tissue culture infective dose) per 0.05 ml and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 2.5 % CO 2 for 1 h, followed by incubation with 0.1 ml HEp-2C cells (150,000 cells per ml) for up to 7 days. The serotypes were determined by inhibition of cytopathic effect by corresponding typespecific antisera. End results were read when the virus control showed 100 % cytopathic effect. Back-titration of the input virus dose and cells without virus inoculation as negative control was run in parallel. In case where the virus could not be neutralized by the antisera used, the test was repeated at 1:20, 1:50, or higher viral dilution if necessary. Isolates that did not type after repeated tests were considered as untypeable.",

The presence of extra-pulmonary manifestations (gastrointestinal symptoms, febrile seizure, conjunctivitis, and skin rash) might potentially serve as a hint for Ad infection as these symptoms were seen in over one third of cases. Some studies have reported leukocytosis or elevated Creactive protein with Ad infections [5, 8] . We have also found neutrophilia in over half of our cases as opposed to lymphopenia or lymphocytosis seen in most other viral infections. Because of the high fever and neutrophilic blood picture, the disease presentation often mimicked bacterial disease and led to unnecessary antibiotic prescription. The fact that Ad infections mimicked bacterial infection and parental anxiety due to persistent high fever might lead to a higher likelihood of hospital admission and hence explained why a considerable number of children were admitted to the hospital for URTI in our locality.",

Residual sequelae were identified in 50 % of the patients who were infected with serotype 3 and in 25 % of those infected with serotype 7. In a Taiwanese study, two out of 48 patients with Ad pneumonia died and five had permanent lung damage, while there was no mortality nor long-term sequelae found in the non-Ad group [12] . While traditionally serotypes 3 and 7 were well known to cause more severe respiratory infections, there were occasional reports on other serotypes which could be potentially associated with severe infections. For example, in the review by Lee et al. [20] , serotype 8 was one risk factor for severe respiratory infection in Korea, while serotype 4 was identified as an important pathogen responsible for the fatal childhood pneumonia in South China [27] . The reason why a certain strain of Ad in some populations was more virulent and damaging to the growing lung was not understood clearly. It was speculated that host variation in immune response and the local virulence of the specific serotype might both play a part [10, 23, 35] . However, the disease severity of Ad respiratory infections in our locality appeared to be less alarming than many of our neighbouring countries. In our study, 14.6 % of those admitted were classified to have lower respiratory tract complications, either acute bronchiolitis or pneumonia, based on rather stringent diagnostic criteria, yet only four patients with LRTI suffered from mild hypoxemia, without severe acute respiratory compromise or mortality. As our study was conducted in a hospital providing both secondary and tertiary care in the region, it should have covered the whole spectrum of patients with severe illness.",

While Ad has been known to be occasionally associated with acute bronchiolitis, the role of serotype 2 has not been previously reported. One study from Cuba reported that serotype 5 accounted for 71 % of the 14 cases of acute bronchiolitis identified, but serotype 2 was not tested for in that study [2] . Their sample size was smaller (49 cases) and with a lower serotyping rate (63 %). The study was not confined to the pediatric age group and there was no clear case definition of acute bronchiolitis versus pneumonia.",

For example, serotype 2 seemed to infect the youngest children predominantly (mean age 1.94\u00b1-1.29 years old), but \"young age\" could also be the risk factor for developing acute bronchiolitis. On the other hand, serotype 3 displayed predilection for the slightly older age groups (mean age 3.43\u00b11.42 years old). It was the leading cause for pneumonia among those aged between 3 and 5 years old, but it did not play any significant role for LRTI in those younger children. Hence, host factor might also be a potential confounding factor for the serotype-respiratory illness association. Further epidemiological studies would be needed to better support our observation.",

Firstly, there was no assurance of standardized documentation relating to the history, physical findings, and radiological interpretation because this was a retrospective study. Secondly, our study was confined to a single centre and the result might not be extrapolated beyond our local community. Thirdly, the neutralization test only routinely tested for serotypes 1 to 7 as these serotypes were considered to be most frequently associated with respiratory disease. It meant that other serotypes (constituted 6.3 % of the total cases) were not serotyped, though the majority of them only caused URTI. The neutralization test also might not be able to type virus isolates containing coinfections with multiple Ad serotypes. Such coinfections, even by serotypes 1-7, might appear nonneutralizable by the serotype-specific sera and would be falsely categorized as non-1-7 serotype. Fourthly, although we had tried to exclude the possible impact of co-infections by other pathogens in the analysis of the clinical disease spectrum, viruses such as human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus and atypical bacteria such as mycoplasma and chlamydia were not tested for. Lastly, it was postulated that Ad might persist and be shed for prolonged periods and thus positive cell cultures for Ad might not represent an etiological link with disease. However, direct immunofluorescence assay from nasopharyngeal aspirate was known to have lower sensitivity than the cell culture method. Currently, there is no good diagnostic test to ascertain acute Ad infection as seroconversion test is not available in most clinical settings.",

Apart from revealing the local serotype pattern and epidemiology, we have shown that Ad generally did not cause severe acute respiratory disease in our young children and long-term pulmonary sequelae was comparatively infrequent, but as the clinical manifestations of Ad infections mimicked bacterial infections, it often led to unnecessary hospital admissions and antibiotic use. Children aged between 1 and 2 years were most at risk for LRTI. Serotypes 2 and 3 were the most prevalent serotypes among our hospitalized children, and they seemed to have a predilection for different age groups and with different resultant respiratory illness association. A longer study period over time is needed to monitor the serotype pattern and disease complication for better understanding and prognostication of Ad infections in the region and to better delineate the potential complex relationship between serotype virulence, host factor, and resultant disease phenotype.",
