            "text": "So far two types of coronavirus surface receptor have been identified 5 . The group II coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) uses murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs), members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors 6 . A number of group I coronaviruses, for example human coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus, require the zinc metalloprotease aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) for entry into their target cells [7] [8] [9] . Recently, a distinct coronavirus has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS, an acute pulmonary syndrome characterized by an atypical pneumonia that results in progressive respiratory failure and death in close to 10% of cases [10] [11] [12] [13] . Analysis of the SARS-CoV genome suggests that this virus does not belong to any of the three defined coronavirus groups, and that the SARS-CoV S protein is similarly distinct 14, 15 . Similar to the analogous human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza proteins, the S proteins of some coronaviruses-including MHV and the group III coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus-are cleaved into two subunits (S1 and S2) by a cellular protease in virus-producing cells 16, 17 . The S proteins of other coronaviruses, including those of group I and probably SARS-CoV, are not cleaved in virus-producing cells 14, 15, 18 . Nonetheless, S1 and S2 domains of these latter S proteins can be identified through their homology with the S1 and S2 subunits of cleaved coronavirus S proteins. The S1 domains of all characterized coronaviruses mediate an initial high-affinity association with their respective receptors [19] [20] [21] .",

Using this same fusion protein (Fig. 1c) or a carboxy terminally tagged form of the S1 domain (Fig. 1b) , a protein band of approximately 110 kDa could be immunoprecipitated from metabolically labelled Vero E6 cells lysed with 0.3% n-decyl-b-Dmaltopyranoside in phosphate-buffered saline.

Eight independent tryptic fragments consistent with sequences comprising 17% of the amino acid sequence of human ACE2 were also identified (Supplementary Information).

For instance, cells expressing the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 can form multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing the HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CCR5 (ref. 24 ). Because syncytia have been observed in Vero E6 cultures infected with SARS-CoV, in SARS-CoV-infected primates, and in SARS patients 10, 12, 13 , we investigated whether 293T cells expressing the SARS-CoV S protein could fuse with 293T cells expressing ACE2. Figure 3a shows that these cells formed syncytia efficiently. As expected, 293T cells transfected with CD4 and CCR5 formed many syncytia with cells expressing HIV-1 gp160 (top left), but not with cells expressing SARS-CoV S protein (bottom left). In contrast, 293T cells expressing ACE2 did not form syncytia with cells expressing gp160 (top right), but formed many large syncytia with cells expressing S protein (bottom right). 293T cells expressing S protein also efficiently formed syncytia with ACE2-but not mock-transfected HeLa cells (not shown). Syncytia formation between S protein-and ACE2-expressing cells was blocked by more than 95% by affinity-purified antibody raised against ACE2, but not by control antibody (Fig. 3b) . These data demonstrate that the ability of the SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cell-cell fusion is dependent on the presence of ACE2.",

Anti-ACE1 antibody had no observable effect on virally induced cytopathicity, whereas anti-ACE2 antibody inhibited cytopathicity in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 4c) .

Moreover, syncytia formation and viral replication were specifically inhibited by an anti-ACE2 antibody. These data demonstrate that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Real-time PCR analysis of 72 human tissues has demonstrated efficient expression of ACE2 messenger RNA in the bronchus and lung parenchyma as well as in the heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract 23 . Lung and kidney are also the primary sites of expression of murine ACE2 (ref. 22) . This tissue distribution is consistent with the pathology of SARS, which is characterized by an acute infection of the lungs 10-12 . SARS-CoV has also been found in kidney tissue of infected patients 10 , and it replicates efficiently on the primate kidney cell lines FRhK-4 and Vero E6 (refs 10, 12) . Active viral replication in the small and large intestine has been observed 25 . Detection of virus in the faeces 11 may reflect expression of ACE2 message in these tissues 23 . The physiological role of ACE2 in most of these tissues has letters to nature not been defined, although ACE2 is thought to be an essential regulator of cardiac function 26 . Candidate substrates, some of which regulate vasopermeability, have been identified 27 . It is unclear whether SARS-CoV interferes with ACE2 enzymatic activity in a manner that contributes to the pathogenesis of SARS.",

This may suggest that some property of this class of proteases contributes to viral replication. However, mutations in the catalytic site of CD13 do not interfere with tissue-culture replication of transmissible gastroenteritis virus, which uses this enzyme as a receptor 7, 28 . Similarly, our preliminary studies showed that syncytia formation mediated by SARS-CoV S protein remained efficient when two active-site histidines of ACE2 were modified to asparagine (Supplementary Information).",

It is possible that some of these may be useful in the treatment of SARS, either by blocking the S-protein-binding site, or by inducing a conformation in ACE2 that is unfavourable to binding or fusion. Alternatively, a soluble form of the receptor itself may slow viral replication in an infected individual. Identification of ACE2 as a SARS-CoV receptor will facilitate description of the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, presumably the most effective target epitope of an S1-proteinbased subunit vaccine. Also, it is likely that a cell line approved for vaccine production and made permissive for viral replication by ACE2 expression will be the most efficient large-scale producer of a whole-killed or attenuated virus for use as a vaccine. A mouse transgenic for human ACE2 may be useful as an animal model of SARS. Finally, study of the interaction between the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2 of other animals may provide insights into the origins of the virus. Thus, if SARS returns as a threat to human health, these studies may contribute to its control. A",

            "text": ", which afflicts about 1% of the world population, is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology that primarily affects the synovial membranes of multiple joints 1-3 . Although CD4 1 T cells seem to be the prime mediators of RA, it remains unclear how arthritogenic CD4 1 T cells are generated and activated [1] [2] [3] . Given that highly self-reactive T-cell clones are deleted during normal T-cell development in the thymus, abnormality in T-cell selection has been suspected as one cause of autoimmune disease 4,5 . Here we show that a spontaneous point mutation of the gene encoding an SH2 domain of ZAP-70, a key signal transduction molecule in T cells 6 , causes chronic autoimmune arthritis in mice that resembles human RA in many aspects. Altered signal transduction from T-cell antigen receptor through the aberrant ZAP-70 changes the thresholds of T cells to thymic selection, leading to the positive selection of otherwise negatively selected autoimmune T cells. Thymic production of arthritogenic T cells due to a genetically determined selection shift of the T-cell repertoire towards high self-reactivity might also be crucial to the development of disease in a subset of patients with RA.The SKG strain, which spontaneously develops chronic arthritis, is derived from our closed breeding colony of BALB/c mice. Joint swelling with hyperaemia became macroscopically evident in SKG mice at about 2 months of age, initially at a few interphalangeal joints of the forepaws, then progressing in a symmetrical fashion to swelling of other finger joints of the forepaws and hindpaws, and larger joints (wrists and ankles) (Fig. 1a-d) . Knee, elbow, shoulder or vertebral joints were rarely affected except for the joint at the base of the tail in aged SKG mice (Fig. 1e) . Radiographic examination revealed destruction and fusion of the subchondral bones, joint dislocation, and osteoporosis by 8-12 months of age (Fig. 1f-i) .Despite suffering from such severe chronic arthritis, most SKG mice survived well to 1 year of age, generally with more severe arthritides in females (Fig. 1j) .Histology of the swollen joints showed severe synovitis with massive subsynovial infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells, villus proliferation of synoviocytes accompanying pannus formation and neovascularization, and neutrophil-rich exudates in the joint cavity (Fig. 1k, l) , with progression of synoviocyte proliferation, pannus-eroded adjacent cartilage and subchondral bone. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that CD4 \u00fe T cells predominantly infiltrated the subsynovial tissue (Fig. 1m, n) . As extra-articular manifestations of the disease, most (more than 90%) mice older than 6 months of age developed interstitial pneumonitis with various degrees of perivascular and",
