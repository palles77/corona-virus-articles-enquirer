Seven studies reported adverse events (six oral and one topical decongestant); meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between the number of adverse events in the treatment group (125 per 1000) compared to the placebo group (126 per 1000). The odds ratio (OR) for adverse events in the treatment group was 0.98 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.40; P = 0.90; GRADE: low-quality evidence).

Due to the small number of studies that used a topical nasal decongestant, we were also unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of oral versus topical decongestants.

There is no cure for the common cold, therefore symptomatic therapy is the only treatment option. Nasal decongestants are widely utilised for symptomatic relief in both adults and children and can be administered in oral or topical form (Del Mar 2003) . Decongestants may contain pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline or xylometazoline. Nasal decongestants are available as tablets or nasal sprays or drops. They are mostly available over-the-counter without restrictions (Eccles 2009). It is recommended that they should not be given to children under the age of six years (NPS Medicinewise 2012). Due to the risk of rebound congestion after stopping use of decongestants it is advised that people should not use a decongestant for longer than five days. Nasal decongestants mainly act locally but there may be systemic effects, such as hypertension. Other common side effects include headache, nausea, insomnia and dizziness (NPS Medicinewise 2012). People taking topical nasal or ophthalmic decongestants quickly develop tachyphylaxis (a rapid decrease in the response to a drug after repeated doses over a short period of time). Long-term use is therefore not recommended, since the agents lose effectiveness after a few days. Previous reviews have considered the safety and efficacy of therapies for indications including seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinitis, common cold and influenza (Dolansky 2008).",

A Cochrane Review of saline nasal irrigation has reported limited evidence of its efficacy in relieving symptoms of nasal secretion and nasal congestion in upper respiratory tract infections (King 2015) . Combination medications have also been studied. For overall recovery it has been reported that combinations of antihistamines, decongestants and analgesics have proven to be more effective compared to placebo (De Sutter 2012) . There was only a modest effect of oral antihistamine-decongestant combinations, oral decongestant-analgesic combinations and oral antihistamine-decongestant-analgesic combinations on nasal congestion. Only oral analgesic combinations seemed to have no effect on the symptoms of nasal congestion.

We included results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported the selected outcomes in the meta-analysis. We calculated the summary weighted OR and 95% CI for dichotomous secondary outcomes using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting. We standardised the results of the studies to a uniform scale when looking at continuous outcomes. In this case, we used the SMD to express the size of the intervention effect in each study relative to the variability observed in that study. We planned to calculate the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for an additional beneficial outcome using the summary OR and the average control event rate described in the relevant studies.

Ten studies used cut-off durations of less than three days (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2004; Latte 2007; Reinecke 2005) ; three studies used cut-offs of less than five days (Ferguson 1997; Jawad 1998; Taverner 1999) . One study counted the total number of colds over the period of a year and did not specify the duration between onset of symptoms and enrolment in the study (Bye 1980) ; another experimentally induced the common cold via intranasal rhinovirus challenge (Sperber 1989) . The duration of follow-up varied from one to 10 days. All six single-dose studies measured the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant on the same day and, thus, had a follow-up of one day (Akerlund 1989; Cohen 1978; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Latte 2004; Taverner 1999 ",

However, in 2000, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) issued a public health advisory recommending that phenylpropanolamine (also known as norephedrine) should not be considered safe for over-the-counter use and asked the drug manufacturers to voluntarily discontinue marketing products containing phenylpropanolamine (FDA 2000) . As a consequence, phenylpropanolamine is no longer available as a decongestant in most countries. Therefore, we excluded Cohen 1978 and Gronborg 1983 from the meta-analyses.",

The results of this assessment are shown for each study in Figure 2 and summarised in Figure 3 . Details of the included studies are presented in Characteristics of included studies. Overall, most judgements were unclear due to lack of detail provided in the trials reports. For example, clear and detailed descriptions of the methods of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding were often missing. Many studies also had pharmaceutical company funding of unknown significance. We deemed only one study to be high risk in any of the six domains (Jawad 1998); this was because the study was not blinded and therefore assessed as high risk in both blinding domains. We assessed seven studies as low risk in this domain, as the authors referenced a randomisation schedule or the method of sequence generation was described in detail (Bye 1980; Cohen 1978; Eccles 2005; Eccles 2006; Latte 2004; Latte 2007; Taverner 1999) . For example, \"Treatment randomisation was from a random numbers table, in blocks of four\" (Latte 2004). We assessed the remaining eight studies as unclear risk for this domain because methods of random sequence generation were not described (Akerlund 1989; Eccles 2008; Eccles 2014; Ferguson 1997; Gronborg 1983; Jawad 1998; Reinecke 2005; Sperber 1989 ).",

We transformed the negative scores (e.g. by multiplying by -1) so that for all comparisons a higher score reflected better functioning and studies could be combined. One study included more than one treatment arm (four different doses of the same nasal decongestant); we combined data from treatment arms that were similar and compared this group to the control group (Akerlund 1989). Heterogeneity was not greater than 90% for any analyses. We tested and reported differences between using fixed-effect and random-effects models, but we applied the random-effects model as the final model for all analyses. The random-effects model generates wider confidence intervals (CIs) than the fixed-effect model (Higgins 2011). We present results for single and multi-dose studies separately as well as all dosages combined for each outcome. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nasal decongestant compared to placebo approximately three hours after the last dose. We chose the timeframe of three hours because clinically we expect that a single or multidose of nasal decongestant would have a similar effect, although it may not be as long lasting in the case of a single dose. Furthermore, most multi-dose studies measured nasal decongestant effectiveness approximately three hours after the last dose. We discuss the results for this comparison only where both single and multidose studies were available for the same outcome. Otherwise, we refer to the results for single or multi-dose comparisons separately. Furthermore, some multi-dose studies also reported outcomes after a single dose. In this comparison only the results after multiple doses are included otherwise the study would be counted twice.",

            "text": "We compared the effectiveness of nasal decongestants administered as single and multiple doses to treat nasal congestion in people with the common cold. We included 15 trials and analyses were based on a total of 1838 participants. Nine studies used pseudoephedrine and three used oxymetazoline. Other decongestants included phenylpropanolamine, norephedrine and xylometazoline. The studies that used phenylpropanolamine or norephedrine were excluded from meta-analyses because this drug is no longer available in most countries (FDA 2000) . There were large differences in reported outcomes. Reporting of study methods was limited in most studies. Therefore, pooling was only possible for a few studies. All studies, except one, included adult participants only (aged 18 years and over). Reinecke 2005 included younger people (aged up to 12 years) but did not provide details on the mean age of participants. As such, the results of this review are applicable to adults only. We were unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of singledose decongestants because pooling was not possible due to the large diversity in measuring and reporting symptoms of congestion. For other outcome measures, such as overall patient wellbeing and time to recovery, either no data or insufficient data were available. For multiple doses of decongestant, meta-analysis was possible for subjective measures of congestion only (measured approximately three hours after the last dose). Subjective measures of congestion were significantly better for treatment group participants compared to placebo group participants. However, the clinical effect was small, and this result was based on two studies only (one topical and one oral decongestant) and involved a total of 88 participants. Hence, for multiple doses of a nasal decongestant it seems that there is a small beneficial effect on nasal congestion when measured subjectively. Although subjective measures of nasal congestion are probably the most relevant outcomes, since nasal decongestants are used for symptomatic relief only, it is not clear if this small effect is clinically relevant and sufficient to justify widespread use of decongestants (Taverner 2007). There were insufficient data to estimate differences in the efficacy of oral versus topical decongestants. Adverse events were reported in nine studies and the risk of adverse events in treatment group participants was not significantly different from people in the placebo group. It seems that short-term use of nasal decongestants in adults with the common cold can be considered safe.",

In addition, because these studies were very heterogeneous in their approach to outcome measures, the number of studies that could be pooled for each outcome was even smaller, with most subgroup analyses only containing two studies. Hence, the generalisability of our results is very limited. With respect to adverse events it was surprising to note that none of the included multi-dose studies investigated the problem of tachyphylaxis or rhinitis medicamentosa. This could be due to the limited follow-up in most studies (between one and 10 days). Furthermore, the side effects profile of oral versus topical decongestants might differ; one might expect more systemic and delayed side effects with oral preparations. We were unable to assess this aspect because only one study that used a topical decongestant reported adverse effects. Twelve studies used subjective measures as outcomes, which are probably the most relevant outcomes to clinical applicability, because nasal decongestants are used for symptomatic relief. In addition, all studies, except one, included participants with community-acquired common cold. The results are only applicable to an adult population because none of the studies included children aged 12 years or younger. Another concern about the applicability of the current evidence relates to the use of pseudoephedrine. Nine studies tested the effectiveness of pseudoephedrine; however, this has not been available since 2005 as an over-the-counter decongestant because it can be used to make methamphetamine (FDA 2005) . Currently, pseudoephedrine is being replaced by phenylephrine as a way to control methamphetamine abuse. Despite phenylephrine being a common decongestant that is available over-the-counter, none of the studies in this review evaluated its effectiveness.",

Two are completed trials with no published results (NCT00452270; NCT01062360), and a third, although originally registered in 2007, is stated to be ongoing (EUCTR2006-006690-25-GB).

            "text": "Our results are in line with those of other systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In a similar, but older, Cochrane Review on nasal decongestants for the common cold, Taverner 2007 concluded that nasal decongestants are modestly effective for the short-term relief of congestion in adults. Two hours after dosing, a significant decrease in patient-reported symptoms for treatment versus placebo was described. Similar to our findings, the effects were small and although statistically significant, it is not clear if the reduction in symptoms is clinically relevant and sufficient to justify widespread use of decongestants (Taverner 2007) . Several other reviews on nasal decongestants for the common cold have also been published (e.g. Allan 2014; Arroll 2005; Arroll 2011; Meltzer 2010). Generally, their conclusions were based on the Cochrane Reviews Taverner 2004 and Taverner 2007, or more recent studies that were included in this review. Accordingly, the results and conclusions are similar and in line with this review. Kollar 2007 investigated the effectiveness of a single 10 mg dose of phenylephrine compared to placebo. Kollar 2007 showed that a single oral dose of phenylephrine significantly improved acute nasal congestion. However, it must be noted that the meta-analyses in this review were almost completely based on small unpublished studies conducted between 1968 and 1975, which were included in a monograph by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to Eccles 2007, the studies included in the FDA report were in-house studies provided by representatives of pharmaceutical companies (Eccles 2007). Another review on xylometazoline (alone and in combination) concluded that xylometazoline provides fast and effective relief from nasal congestion (Eccles 2010). However, this review included only four studies and did not include a meta-analysis. We included only one study that used xylometazoline (Eccles 2008). Hence, we were unable to formulate firm conclusions about the effectiveness of this medication. Furthermore, it was beyond the scope of our review to evaluate the effectiveness of different nasal decongestants individually.",

The lack of evidence in children was also confirmed by other studies on decongestants alone and combination products (Allan 2014; Arroll 2005; De Sutter 2012). In terms of the risk of side effects our results were in agreement with other reviews and studies; the incidence of side effects with shortterm use of decongestants is low and side effects are mostly mild to moderate (e.g. insomnia and headache) (Allan 2014; Eccles 2010; Taverner 2007). Although we did not identify data on the safety of nasal decongestants in children, there are reports of adverse events after single use of nasal decongestant. For example, the FDA published a warning in 2012 about serious adverse events after ingestion of over-the-counter nasal sprays containing oxymetazoline by children under the age of six years (FDA 2012).",

Only one single-dose study (Akerlund 1989) and one multi-dose study (Eccles 2008) used a topical decongestant. Pooling was possible for four studies only (Analysis 2.3): two single-dose studies (Akerlund 1989; Latte 2004) and two multi-dose studies (Eccles 2005; Latte 2007).Two studies reported a reduced mean NAR compared with placebo(Akerlund 1989; Eccles 2005), but the reduction was small and not statistically significant (SMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.99; 332 participants; two studies; Analysis 2.3). Akerlund 1989 used a topical decongestant and Eccles 2005 used an oral decongestant. The difference between studies that used an oral or topical decongestants was statistically significant (P = 0.03); the effect of treatment was significant in Akerlund 1989 (topical decongestant) and not significant in Eccles 2005 (oral decongestant). However, each subgroup only included one study. There seemed to be considerable heterogeneity as shown by an I\u00b2 statistic of 78%. The different measurement instruments probably explain the high heterogeneity; Akerlund 1989 measured NAR with anterior rhinomanometry in the left nostril whereas Eccles 2005 measured NAR with posterior rhinomanometry. We applied a random-effects model because this changed the interpretation of the results from statistically significant to not statistically significant.1.3.2. Oral decongestantsLatte 2004 and Latte 2007 used an oral decongestant and reported the AUC for NAR. Their pooled effect was not statistically significant (SMD 0.44, 95% CI -0.32 to 1.20; 260 participants; two studies; Analysis 2.3). For the pooled effect of the AUC for NAR, there seemed to be considerable heterogeneity as shown by an I\u00b2 statistic of 82%. Interestingly, Latte 2004 and Latte 2007 were conducted at the same institution with the same research team. Both assessed the effectiveness of pseudoephedrine in a similar population. The only differences between the studies were the dosage and the measurement instrument; Latte 2004 was a single-dose study and NAR was measured with acoustic rhinomanometry, whereas Latte 2007 was a multi-dose study, with NAR being measured by posterior rhinomanometry. We applied a random-effects model because this changed the interpretation of the results from statistically significant to not statistically significant.Only Akerlund 1989 and Eccles 2008 used a topical decongestant. Akerlund 1989 reported the mean NAR whereas Eccles 2008 reported the least square mean of NAC. Therefore, we were unable to pool results.
