            "text": "In this study, specific sequences within three genes (3D, VP4 and 2B) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome were determined to be effective RNAi targets. These sequences are highly conserved among different serotype viruses based on sequence analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)expressing plasmids (p3D-NT19, p3D-NT56, pVP4-NT19, pVP4-NT65 and p2B-NT25) were constructed to express siRNA targeting 3D, VP4 and 2B, respectively. The antiviral potential of these siRNA for various FMDV isolates was investigated in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and suckling mice. The results show that these siRNA inhibited virus yield 10-to 300-fold for different FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I at 48 h post infection in BHK-21 cells compared to control cells. In suckling mice, p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 delayed the death of mice. Twenty percent to 40% of the animals that received a single siRNA dose survived 5 days post infection with serotype O or serotype Asia I. We used an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis (C500) vaccine strain, to carry the plasmid that expresses siRNA directed against the polymerase gene 3D (p3D-NT56) of FMDV. We used guinea pigs to evaluate the inhibitory effects of recombinant S. cho (p3D-NT56/S. cho) on FMDV infection. The results show that 80% of guinea pigs inoculated with 10 9 CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged 36 h later with 50 ID 50 of homologous FMDV were protected. We also measured the antiviral activity of p3D-NT56/S. cho in swine. The results indicate that 100% of the animals treated with 5 \u00b7 10 9 CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho were protected in 9 days.",

The disease has been known for five centuries and its causative agent, the FMD virus (FMDV), belongs to the genus Aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae [1] . The FMDV genome is composed of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule of about 8500 nucleotides that contains a unique open reading frame. Like other RNA viruses, FMDV is antigenically variable and undergoes rapid mutation. There are seven distinguishable serological types of FMDV, namely O, A, C, Asia I, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3. Current FMD vaccines based on inactivated virus are effective in preventing the disease, but carry the risks of incomplete inactivation and viral escape from vaccine production laboratories [26] , and they fail to induce an immune response in a short period. Thus, the development of emergency antiviral strategies is necessary in order to stem outbreaks of FMD.",

            "text": "As an antiviral technology, RNAi has already been widely researched for use with FMDV [5, 24, 33] . However, establishing RNAi as a viable approach to prevent FMDV requires resolving at least one major issue [17, 20] : the high genetic variability of FMD viruses. RNAi directed toward specific gene sequences of certain FMDV strains may face risks, especially in the event of an emergent FMD outbreak, because no information about the serotype or genotype of the isolated pathogen would be available while early protection is needed. Therefore, it may be necessary to design several siRNA that focus on the conserved regions of the viral genome [16, 17, 42, 46] . Previously, we showed that siRNA generated in vitro can effectively inhibit the replication of FMDV in either a specific or cross-inhibitory manner [28] . Another crucial issue that needs to be addressed is the optimal vector for delivery of siRNA-expressing cassettes. Chen et al. [6] demonstrated that treatment with recombinant, replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 expressing short-hairpin RNA significantly reduces the susceptibility of guinea pigs and swine to FMDV infection. However, adenovirus VA1 non-coding RNA is able to inhibit the biogenesis of siRNA and microRNA [30] . This finding suggests that novel siRNA delivery systems would be necessary.",

The potential of RNAi as an antiviral strategy against FMDV in relevant animal systems is of great interest. The fact that attenuated Salmonella is widely used as a DNA vaccine vector made us choose it as the vector for siRNA delivery. To test the anti-FMDV potential of rS. cho, we challenged guinea pigs pretreated by intramuscular injection of rS. cho constructs with FMDV HKN/2002. All saline-treated animals developed the major clinical sign of FMD, the appearance of vesicles on the feet, within 48 h of challenge (Tab. I). Guinea pigs treated with pLacZ/S. cho were not protected at all, though the clinical signs were delayed in some animals, as shown in Table I . However, 4 of 5 guinea pigs pretreated with 10 9 CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged with 50 ID 50 of HKN/2002 developed none of the clinical signs such as vesicles or high fever. These results indicated that S. cho-delivered siRNA exerted in vivo inhibitory activity against FMDV in guinea pigs.",

Animals were intramuscularly inoculated with 5 \u00b7 10 9 CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged 24 h later with 100 ID 50 of HKN/2002. All of the saline-treated swine developed acute signs of FMD, including vesicles and fever (Fig. 3A) . Animal 1-48 had vesicles as early as 3 dpc, and its symptoms were extraordinarily severe. In comparison with this group, animals inoculated with either pLacZ/ S. cho or S. cho showed no signs of significant antiviral activity (Figs. 3B and 3C) . However, p3D-NT56/S. cho conferred marked antiviral activity that could be seen for more than 9 days of observation (Fig. 3D) . Animal 2-7 in this group developed a fever but no vesicles during the observation period. Although animals 5-6, 3-3 and 1-1 developed vesicles, they were fewer and developed much later. In another group inoculated with 5 \u00b7 10 10 CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho, none of the animals were protected (Fig. 3E ), but animal 7-1 showed delayed disease onset and milder disease than the control animals. Serum samples were collected at 0, 7, and 14 dpc and tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies and antibodies against viral NS protein 3ABC of FMDV. No animals had marked FMDV-specific antibodies at 0 dpc, including anti-3ABC antibodies (Tab. II). Animals in the control groups treated with saline, S. cho or pLacZ/S. cho developed a high neutralizing antibody response at 7 and 14 dpc, suggesting that these animals were exposed to a very large amount of FMDV (Tab. II). A very low neutralizing antibody response was detected at 7 dpc in animals (2-7, 5-6, 3-3, 1-1, 7-1 and 1-34) that were inoculated with p3D-NT56/S. cho, suggesting that these animals effectively suppressed virus replication. A key distinguishing feature of infected animals is the induction of antibodies against the polyprotein 3ABC of FMDV [45] . Using an LPB-ELISA, we showed that the animals developing FMD had significantly higher levels of antibodies against 3ABC as compared to the disease-free animals (Tab. II). These results of serological analysis were consistent with the observation of clinical signs.",

            "text": "Strategies aimed at conferring rapid and efficient protection against FMDV have to face one main challenging factor: the rapid, acute infection caused by this virus, which makes the absence of sufficient amounts of antibodies or other interfering factors essential for protection. The traditional emergency vaccines based on virus inactivation could be effective in preventing disease within 4 to 5 days post-vaccination, due to a critical role for innate immune defenses [2, 39] . However, signs of disease can appear as early as 2 days post-exposure. Thus, it is necessary to develop antiviral strategies capable of inducing early protection in the face of an outbreak that threatens to spread widely. Recently, we and several other groups demonstrated that RNAi can be potentially used as a therapeutic Table I or prophylactic mechanism against FMDV [6, 24, 33] . However, to be effective against RNA viruses such as FMDV, which are highly antigenically variable, the siRNA must be targeted to conserved regions. Here, we provide evidence that siRNA targeted to conserved regions of the FMDV genome could effectively inhibit the virus replication of multiple FMDV serotypes. In this study, three genes, namely 3D, VP4 and 2B, were selected as targets for three reasons. First, it is well known that different siR-NA have different efficiencies in inducing RNAi [21] [22] [23] . Second, the proteins encoded by these genes have essential functions in different phases of the viral replication cycle. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D) is a key enzyme in viral RNA replication [34, 44] ; VP4 is a structural protein, located inside the mature virus particle, and is involved in conversion of provirions to mature virions [1] ; and 2B is involved in membrane rearrangements required for viral RNA replication and capsid assembly [19] . Third, we compared 14 reported FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I. The analysis showed that the sequences in these regions are relatively conserved between different FMDV serotypes. Efficient delivery of siRNA into cells or organs in vivo remains a major bottleneck in antiviral therapy. A number of methods for delivering siRNA in vivo have been tested [3, 15, 27, 49] . Liposome formulations are generally used [3, 15, 49] , but a simple intranasal administration of naked siRNA has been shown to be effective against respiratory viruses [3] . Chen et al. [6] used adenoviruses as the vectors for the delivery of duplex RNA to the target tissue, and total RNA were extracted from five tissues (oropharynx, lung, liver, muscle, and epidermis of the foot) of guinea pigs treated with rAd5 and assayed for rAd5 GFP mRNA. The vast majority of rAd5 was found in the liver. In cloven-hoofed animals, the oropharynx has been identified as the major site of FMDV replication during acute and persistent infection [37] . Brown et al. [4] indicated that the FMDV RNA was localized in the tonsil, pharynx and the tracheo-bronchial lymph node. The different tissue distribution of rAd5 and FMDV is probably related to antiviral activity of rAd5 in vivo. Our overall goal was to find a siRNA vector that can spread through the similar infection and transmission tract as FMDV. Attenuated Salmonella has become popular for expressing foreign antigens as a vaccine strain or as a delivery vector of DNA vaccines [10, 12] . Gray et al. [18] found that S. choleraesuis was most often recovered from the lymph node, tonsil, lung and alimentary tract of swine inoculated with S. choleraesuis. These studies aroused our interest in evaluating the potential of Salmonella as a vector for siRNA delivery. We found that 80% of guinea pigs were completely protected when inoculated with 10 9 CFU of p3D-NT56/rS. cho, and that rS. cho also conferred marked antiviral activity in swine. Surprisingly, the antiviral potential of RNAi was evidently impaired in animals treated with a high dose of rS. cho. Srinivasan et al. [43] demonstrated that variation in the initial dose of infection with Salmonella had a profound effect on the response of Salmonella flagellin-specific CD4 T cells in vivo, and that low-dose infection could evade Salmonella flagellin-specific T cell activation completely. Mercado et al. [32] reported that a 25-fold dilution in bacterial challenge dose did not significantly alter the size or kinetics of the Listeria LLO 91-99 -specific CD8 T cell response. The low-dose effect may represent a general mechanism to increase virulence. The immune evasion could probably make the lower dose salmonella more efficient as a vector to carry siRNA.",

The results indicate that no significant increase in antiviral effect was achieved in the group treated with the p3D-NT56/S. cho+Ad5-POL mixture, as compared to the group treated with p3D-NT56/S. cho alone. Kim et al. [25] attempted to improve the antiviral effect by use of a mixture of two adenovirus constructs, by giving two injections of shRNA prior to FMDV challenge and by giving injections after FMDV challenge. The high survival rate was maintained by treatment with adenoviruses post-challenge. These results could encourage us to seek more efficient methods of treatment.",

Liu et al.[28] demonstrated that siRNA directed to the conserved regions of the FMDV genome, namely VP4 and 3D, could inhibit the replication of both FMDV strains, serotype O and Asia I. Our study indicates that p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 dramatically inhibited viral replication in cultured cells that were susceptible to FMDV of either serotype O or serotype Asia I. Suckling mice treated with the siRNA-expressing plasmids had significantly reduced susceptibility to both serotype O and serotype Asia I of FMDV.",
