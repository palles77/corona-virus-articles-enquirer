Notably, 1200 confirmed cases have been reported in 26 other countries beyond China. 2 Since the outbreak, China has taken unprecedented measures to contain the spread of the virus within China. Though the number of cases outside China has remained relatively small, it's very challenging that some of the cases did not have clear epidemiological link, and some asymptomatic carriers with SARS-CoV-2 might be a new potential source of infection. It's very worrisome that South Korea and Italian now have the most confirmed cases outside China.",
