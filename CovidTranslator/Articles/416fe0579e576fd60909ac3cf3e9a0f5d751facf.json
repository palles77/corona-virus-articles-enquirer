            "text": "The SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein mediates membrane fusion events during virus entry and virus-induced cell-to-cell fusion. To delineate functional domains of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, single point mutations, cluster-to-lysine and cluster-to-alanine mutations, as well as carboxyl-terminal truncations were investigated in transient expression experiments. Mutagenesis of either the coiled-coil domain of the S glycoprotein amino terminal heptad repeat, the predicted fusion peptide, or an adjacent but distinct region, severely compromised S-mediated cell-to-cell fusion, while intracellular transport and cell-surface expression were not adversely affected. Surprisingly, a carboxyl-terminal truncation of 17 amino acids substantially increased S glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion suggesting that the terminal 17 amino acids regulated the S fusogenic properties. In contrast, truncation of 26 or 39 amino acids eliminating either one or both of the two endodomain cysteine-rich motifs, respectively, inhibited cell fusion in comparison to the wild-type S. The 17 and 26 amino-acid deletions did not adversely affect S cell-surface expression, while the 39 amino-acid truncation inhibited S cell-surface expression suggesting that the membrane proximal cysteine-rich motif plays an essential role in S cell-surface expression. Mutagenesis of the acidic amino-acid cluster in the carboxyl terminus of the S glycoprotein as well as modification of a predicted phosphorylation site within the acidic cluster revealed that this amino-acid motif may play a functional role in the retention of S at cell surfaces. This genetic analysis reveals that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein contains extracellular domains that regulate cell fusion as well as distinct endodomains that function in intracellular transport, cell-surface expression, and cell fusion.

The etiological agent of the disease was found to be a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was first isolated from infected individuals by propagation of the virus on Vero E6 cells Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . Analysis of the viral genome has demonstrated that the SARS-CoV is phylogenetically divergent from the three known antigenic groups of coronaviruses Ksiazek et al., 2003).

The S glycoprotein is primarily responsible for entry of all coronaviruses into susceptible cells through binding to specific receptors on cells and mediating subsequent virus-cell fusion (Cavanagh, 1995) . The S glycoprotein specified by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits, although cleavage is not necessarily required for virus-cell fusion (Bos et al., 1997; Gombold et al., 1993; Stauber et al., 1993) . Similarly, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein seems to be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits in Vero-E6-infected cells , while it is not known whether this cleavage affects S-mediated cell fusion. The SARS-CoV receptor has been recently identified as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) . Although the exact mechanism by which the SARS-CoV enters the host cell has not been elucidated, it is most likely similar to other coronaviruses. Upon receptor binding at the cell membrane, the S glycoprotein is thought to undergo a dramatic conformational change causing exposure of a hydrophobic fusion peptide, which is subsequently inserted into cellular membranes. This conformational change of the S glycoprotein causes close apposition followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes resulting in entry of the virion nucleocapsids into cells (Eckert and Kim, 2001; Tsai et al., 2003; Zelus et al., 2003) . This series of S-mediated virus entry events is similar to other class I virus fusion proteins (Baker et al., 1999; Melikyan et al., 2000; Russell et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "Heptad repeat (HR) regions, a sequence motif characteristic of coiled-coils, appear to be a common motif in many viral and cellular fusion proteins (Skehel and Wiley, 1998) . These coiled-coil regions allow the protein to fold back upon itself as a prerequisite step to initiating the membrane fusion event. There are usually two HR regions: an N terminal HR region adjacent to the fusion peptide and a C-terminal HR region close to the transmembrane region of the protein. Within the HR segments, the first amino acid (a) and fourth amino acid (d) are typically hydrophobic amino acids that play a vital role in maintaining coiled-coil interactions. Based on structural similarities, two classes of viral fusion proteins have been established. Class I viral fusion proteins contain two heptad repeat regions and an Nterminal or N-proximal fusion peptide. Class II viral fusion proteins lack heptad repeat regions and contain an internal fusion peptide (Lescar et al., 2001) . The MHV S glycoprotein, which is similar to other coronavirus S glycoproteins, is a class I membrane protein that is transported to the plasma membrane after being synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (Bosch et al., 2003) . Typically, the ectodomains of the S2 subunits of coronaviruses contain two regions with a 4, 3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat the first being adjacent to the fusion peptide and the other being in close proximity to the transmembrane region (de Groot et al., 1987) .",

Specifically, for coronaviruses, the MHV S glycoprotein endodomain has been shown to contain charged-rich and cysteine-rich regions, which are critical for fusion of infected cells (Bos et al., 1995; Chang et al., 2000; Ye et al., 2004) . The carboxyl-terminal portion of the S glycoprotein contains a consensus acidic aminoacid cluster with a motif that has been predicted by the NetPhos 2.0 software to be phosphorylated (Blom et al., 1999) . To investigate the potential role of the acidic aminoacid cluster in synthesis, transport, and cell fusion, serial truncations of S were constructed. The acidic cluster was specifically targeted by mutagenizing the predicted phosphorylation site embedded within the acidic cluster as well as by replacing acidic residues of the acidic cluster with alanine residues. In addition, carboxyl-terminal truncations of 8, 17, 26, and 41 amino acids were engineered by insertion of stop codons within the S glycoprotein gene. The 8 aa truncation (T1247) was designed to bring the predicted charged cluster DEDDSE proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the mutated S glycoprotein (Fig. 1C) . Similarly, the 17 aa truncation (T1238) was designed to delete the DEDDSE acidic cluster. The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein endodomain contains two cysteine residue clusters, a CCMTSCCSC (CRM1) cluster immediately adjacent to the membrane and a CSCGSCC (CRM2) downstream of the first cluster. To address the role of these domains in S glycoproteinmediated cell-to-cell fusion, the 26 aa truncation (T1229) was designed to delete the CRM2 domain, while the 41 aa truncation (T1214) deleted both the CRM1 and CRM2 domains (Fig. 1C) .",

A recombinant S protein having the 3xFLAG added inframe to the carboxyl terminus of S was used as a negative control, since it would not be stained by the live cell reaction conditions (see Materials and methods). Both wildtype versions of S having the 3xFLAG, either at the amino or carboxyl terminus of S, caused similar amounts of fusion ( Fig. 3) , which also was similar to that obtained with the untagged wild-type S (not shown). The relative amounts of cell-surface versus total cellular expression of S were obtained through the use of an ELISA. A ratio between the cell-surface localized S and total cellular S expression was then calculated and normalized to the corresponding ratio obtained with the wild-type S glycoprotein (see Materials and methods) (Fig. 4) .

To determine the ability of each mutant S glycoprotein to cause cell-to-cell fusion and the formation of syncytia, fused cells were labeled by immunohistochemistry using the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5) . The extent of cell-tocell fusion caused by each mutant glycoprotein was calculated by obtaining the average size of approximately 300 syncytia. The average syncytium size for each mutant was then normalized to that found in wild-type S-transfected cells (see Materials and methods). The CL1 (73%), CL2 (75%), CL3 (68%), CL4 (71%), CL5 (76%), CL6 (51%) as well as the T1214 (86%) and T1247 (66%) mutants inhibited the formation of syncytia by the percentages indicated. The T1229 truncation and the cluster mutant CL7 produced syncytia, which were on the average 22% and 15% smaller, respectively, than that of the wild-type S. In contrast, the T1238 mutant produced on the average 43% larger syncytia than that of the wild-type S (Fig. 5) .",

In this assay, cell-surface-expressed S was reacted with anti-FLAG antibody at 4 -C and subsequently, cells were incubated at 37 -C for different time periods before processing for confocal microscopy (see Materials and methods). Generally, these time-dependent endocytosis studies were in agreement with the results shown in Fig.  6 . Specifically, in cells that were not shifted to 37 -C, referred to as time zero cells, wild-type and mutant spike were detected exclusively at the surface of the cells (Fig. 7 , panels A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1). At 5 and 15 min after the shift to 37 -C, the wild-type S remained exclusively at the surface while the other S mutants were detected in numerous intracellular vesicles dispersed inside the cell (Fig. 7 , panels A2 and A3 compared to panels B2 and B3, C2 and C3, D2 and D3, E2 and E3, F2 and F3). By 60 min after the shift to 37 -C, the wild-type S was still localized exclusively to the surface of the cell (Fig. 7, panel A4) , while the T1229, T1238, CL6, and CL7 S mutants appeared to be present throughout the cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. 7 , panels B4, C4, E4, F4). The T1247 S mutant seemed to undergo rapid and complete endocytosis during the 60 min observation and appeared to localize into punctuate structures in the cytoplasm of cells unlike the fairly even cellular distribution of all other S mutants Fig. 4 . Ratios of cell-surface to total cellular expression of mutant SARS-CoV S glycoproteins. Detection of cell-surface and total glycoprotein distribution was determined by immunohistochemistry and ELISA (see Materials and methods). Cell-surface expression of the S glycoprotein was measured by incubating the transfected cell monolayers with anti-FLAG antibody at room temperature before permeabilization. For total S glycoprotein detection, cells were fixed and permeabilized prior to incubation with the anti-FLAG antibody. A ratio between the surface localization and the total expression was calculated and normalized to the wild-type protein, then set to a percentage of the wild-type. The error bars represent the maximum and minimum surface to total ratios obtained from three independent experiments, and the bar height represents the average surface to total ratio.

Currently, specific membrane fusion models have been proposed all of which include the following general steps: (a) binding of a receptor through a receptor-specific domain located within the ectodomain of the viral glycoprotein; (b) induction of a conformational change via low pH or binding to the receptor that exposes a fusion peptide, typically a hydrophobic region in the membrane-anchored subunit, which inserts into the cellular lipid membrane; (c) formation of a trimer-of-hairpins-like structure by a-helical peptides, termed heptad repeat segments, via a transient prehairpin intermediate that facilitates the juxtaposition of the viral and cellular membranes which then leads to fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes (reviewed in Eckert and Kim, 2001; Hernandez et al., 1996) . Although the most important domains of the class I fusion proteins are naturally located in their ectodomains, it has been reported that intracytoplasmic endodomains play an important role in intracellular transport and virus-induced cell fusion (Bagai and Lamb, 1996; Bos et al., 1995; Chang et al., 2000; Lontok et al., 2004; Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2004; Sergel and Morrison, 1995; Seth et al., 2003; Tong et al., 2002; Waning et al., 2004; Yao and Compans, 1995) .",

This S mutant exhibited a 65% reduction in cell fusion in comparison to the wild-type S, while cell-surface expression was reduced by 20% in comparison to the wild-type S (Table 1 ; Group I mutants). Kinetic endocytosis experiments revealed that the T1247 S mutant also endocytosed much faster than the wild-type S glycoprotein. Acidic cluster motifs are known to serve as endocytotic signals (Brideau et al., 1999; Zhu et al., 1996) . The rapid endocytosis of the T1247 S mutant form may be due to the relocation of the acidic cluster KFDEDDSE proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the S glycoprotein after removal of the terminal 8 amino acids resulting in more efficient endocytosis. Therefore, the inability of the S mutant form to cause extensive cell fusion may be due primarily to its rapid endocytosis from cell surfaces. It is worth noting that a similar deletion of 8 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the MHV S glycoprotein resulted in enhanced S-mediated cell fusion (Chang et al., 2000) . A comparison of the carboxyl-terminal amino-acid sequences of these two glycoproteins reveals that the MHV S does not have a well-defined acidic cluster in the SARS-COV S homologous location; however, the last three amino acids of the MHV S are charged residues (HED). Therefore, the ability of the truncated MHV S to cause more cell fusion may be due to increased surface retention resulting from a reduction in endocytosis mediated by these charged residues. Alternatively, the MHV deletion may cause structural changes that enhance the MHV S fusogenicity by destabilizing the overall structure of the glycoprotein. Stabilization of the carboxyl terminus has been shown to decrease the fusion activity of the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (Waning et al., 2004) ; therefore, conversely, it is possible that destabilization of the carboxyl terminus may cause an increase in fusion.",

This S mutant glycoprotein exhibited a more than 40% increase in cell fusion relative to the S wild type, while there was only a slight decrease in cell-surface expression (Table 1 ; Group IV mutants). The fact that the overall levels of S glycoprotein detected on cell surfaces as well as the endocytosis profile were not altered suggests that this deletion may enhance fusion via a structural destabilization of the glycoprotein. In contrast, changing acidic amino acids of the acidic motif to alanine residues inhibited cell fusion indicating that the acidic motif was important for S-mediated cell fusion. Specifically, the CL6 cluster mutation changed the acidic residues (DEDDSE) to alanine residues (AAAASA). This mutant protein, while being efficiently expressed at cellular surfaces (87% of the wild-type protein), exhibited a 51% reduction in fusion activity in comparison to the wild type (Table 1 ; Group I mutant). The observed reduction in Smediated cell fusion suggests that the acidic cluster plays an important regulatory role in S-mediated cell fusion without appreciably affecting intracellular transport and cell-surface expression. This result is in sharp contrast to the T1238 truncation that deleted the acidic cluster and caused enhanced S-mediated cell fusion. A possible explanation for these seemingly disparate results is that modifications of the carboxyl terminus produce differential effects on the structure and function of the protein by rendering the S glycoprotein more or less prone to S-mediated fusion. Alternatively, it is possible that the acidic cluster plays important roles only in the context of the entire S glycoprotein by regulating binding to other viral or cellular proteins that may modify the S fusogenic properties.",

To address the role of this predicted phosphorylation site within the acidic cluster, the CL7 cluster mutation was constructed. The CL7 replaces the serine residue with an alanine residue within the acidic cluster. This mutant S protein fused cells extensively (85% of the wild type) and was expressed on cell surfaces at levels similar to that of the wild-type S (88% of the wild type) ( Table 1 ; Group II mutants), suggesting that the potential phosphorylation site does not play an important role in Smediated cell fusion and cell-surface expression. However, the CL7 mutant appeared to recycle to early endosomes in contrast to the wild-type S, which remained mostly on cell surfaces. Therefore, it is possible that the altered putative phosphorylation site within the acidic cluster may play a yet unknown role in S retention at cell surfaces. Conversely, lack of this signal may cause aberrant endocytosis to early endosomes. The overall charge of the carboxyl terminus may also play some role in the structure and function of S. In this regard, there are additional charged amino acids dispersed upstream and downstream of the mutated charged cluster that may play some role in S transport and Smediated fusion through electrostatic interactions with other viral and cellular proteins.

            "text": "In contrast to the MHV S glycoprotein, in which the domains overlap, the charged region of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and the two cysteine-rich motifs CRM1 and CRM2 are separate distinct regions (Figs. 1C and 8) . The T1229 mutation deleted the CRM2 domain, while the T1214 truncation deleted both CRM1 and CRM2. Deletion of the CRM2 slightly inhibited surface expression (91% of the wild type) while reducing fusion activity by 22% (Table 1 ; Group II mutants). A similar truncation of the MHV S glycoprotein produced a comparable effect on cell fusion (Chang et al., 2000) . The 1214 truncation severely inhibited cell-surface expression by 77%, when compared to the wild type, while cell-to-cell fusion activity was reduced by 84% (Table 1 ; Group III mutant). These results differ from previously published data on similar truncations of the MHV S glycoprotein. Specifically, it was found that the replacement of the entire cysteine-rich domain with amino-acid sequences derived from the cytoplasmic terminus of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein D (gD) severely inhibited MHV S glycoprotein function without necessarily affecting cellsurface expression (Chang et al., 2000; Ye et al., 2004) . In contrast, the SARS-CoV S T1214 mutant glycoprotein failed to be expressed on cell surfaces explaining the inability of this glycoprotein to cause cell fusion. These results suggest that the proximal cysteine residues of the SARS CoV S play crucial roles in intracellular transport and cell-surface expression. The discrepancy with the MHV S carboxyl-terminal replacements may be due to additional gD sequences that facilitated intracellular transport and cell-surface expression. It is worth noting that depending on the algorithm used to predict the membrane spanning domain of S, a few of the cysteine residues may be included in the membrane spanning region (Chang et al., 2000; Ye et al., 2004) . Therefore, it is possible that deletion of these cysteine residues may lead to S misincorpo-ration into membranes, resulting in the apparent transport defects.",
