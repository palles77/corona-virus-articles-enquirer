            "text": "A reverse transcription nested PCR (RT-PCR) sequencing methodology was developed and used to generate sequence data from the spike genes of three geographically and chronologically distinct human coronaviruses 229E. These three coronaviruses were isolated originally from the USA in the 1960s (human coronavirus 229E strain ATCC VR-74), the UK in the 1990s (human coronavirus 229E LRI 281) and Ghana (human coronavirus 229E A162). Upon translation and alignment with the published spike protein sequence of human coronavirus 229E 'LP' (isolated in the UK in the 1970s), it was found that variation within the translated protein sequences was rather limited. In particular, minimal variation was observed between the translated spike protein sequence of human coronaviruses 229E LP and ATCC VR-74 (1/1012 amino acid differences), whilst most variation was observed between the translated spike protein sequence of human coronaviruses 229E LP and A162 (47/1012 amino acid changes). Further, the translated spike protein sequence of human coronavirus 229E A162 showed three clusters of amino acid changes, situated within the 5% half of the translated spike protein sequence.",

They derive their name from their characteristic 'crown-like' appearance in electron micrographs imbued by a fringe of club shaped spike (or peplomer) proteins inserted into the viral envelope. Virions are lipid enveloped and are approximately 80-120 nm in diameter; there is a single stranded genome of positive sense RNA approximately 30 kb in length. They also have a characteristic replication strategy, in that the positive sense genomic RNA is first transcribed into negative sense intermediate RNAs (by a virus encoded transcriptase) from which a nested 3% co-terminus set of five to eight subgenomic mR-NAs (six subgenomic RNAs for human coronaviruses) are transcribed. The subgenomic mRNAs have identical 3% ends but extend for different lengths in the 5% direction (Lai, 1990) .",

The spike glycoprotein is of particular importance in the infectious process because: (a) it is the site for the virus anti-receptor (Collins et al., 1982) ; (b) it has fusion activity (De Groot et al., 1989) ; and (c) it contains sites against which major neutralising antibodies are directed (Jimenez et al., 1986) .

Indeed, Parker et al. (1995) indicated that the use of automated dye-terminator sequencing chemistry resulted in chromatogram artifactual peaks whose presence was determined by the nucleotide sequence immediately 5% (i.e. downstream) to the artefact itself. Interestingly, it was noted that the nucleotide sequences immediately 5% to chromatogram artefactual peaks in this project did not correspond with the 5% nucleotide sequences generating artefactual peaks indicated by Parker et al. (1995) (even though automated dye-terminator sequencing chemistry was utilised in both projects). This apparent discrepancy was brought about by the fact that Parker et al. utilised Amplitaq enzyme (Perkin Elmer) in their dye-terminator sequencing reactions, whereas in this project Amplitaq FS (FS, fluorescent sequencing) enzyme (Perkin Elmer) was utilised.

This appears to contrast with another member of the same coronavirus serogroup as human coronaviruses 229E, canine coronavirus (Horsburgh and Brown, 1995) in which heterogeneity was distributed throughout the spike gene sequences of two geographically distinct (one British and one American) isolates. Also, a high degree of genome recombination events has been observed during mixed infections with different murine coronavirus strains (Lai et al., 1985) and different avian infectious bronchitis virus strains (Kusters et al., 1990) . Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that in the absence of selection pressure these recombination events occur in a random manner . As only minor changes are seen in the translated spike protein sequences obtained in this project, it may be possible that during human coronavirus 229E infections selection pressure plays a dominant role in limiting the degree of spike gene variation (alternatively, multiple human coronavirus 229E infections may be a relatively rare event).",

            "text": "One possible explanation for the degree of homology observed between the translated spike protein sequences of human coronavirus 229E 'LP' and human coronavirus 229E strain ATCC VR-74 relies upon the fact that both of these viruses were adapted to tissue culture by serial passaging. In particular, MRC5 (Medical Research Council No. 5) human embryonic lung fibroblasts were the final replicative host for human coronavirus 229E strain ATCC VR-74, whilst Clone 16 human embryonic lung fibroblasts (the 16th clone of heteroploid MRC-c cells Philpotts, 1983) were the final replicative host for human coronavirus 229E 'LP' (Raabe et al., 1990) . As MRC5 and MRC-c cells are closely related, it may feasible that adaptation of human coronaviruses 229E to these similar cell lines may facilitate similar spike protein conformations. These similar spike protein conformations would be expected to have similar protein sequences and by reverse translation, similar spike gene sequences. Further, if such 'convergent evolution' does indeed occur, then it is possible that the spike gene sequences obtained from serially passaged, tissue culture adapted human coronaviruses 229E may differ from the spike gene sequences of the original isolates. In this case, the accuracy of spike gene sequence data from human coronaviruses 229E which had been isolated by serial passage in tissue culture may be called into question. In this project, spike gene PCR amplification of human coronavirus 229E isolates LRI 281 and A162 was undertaken directly from clinical specimens.",

This point is illustrated most obviously upon examination of the translated spike protein sequence of human coronavirus 229E A162, where three apparent clusters of nucleotide variation were observed, all in the 5% half of the translated spike protein sequence. Interestingly, research by , working with mouse hepatitis virus, indicated that the 5% end of the murine coronavirus spike gene may be the preferred site for RNA recombination events for this particular coronavirus. Moreover, comparisons of the spike protein sequences of avian infectious bronchitis virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, murine hepatitis virus and transmissible gastro-enteritis virus have indicated that the 3% (C-terminal) portion of the spike protein is rather more conserved than the corresponding 5% (amino-terminal portion) portion of the spike gene (Cavanagh, 1995) .",

However, in order to assess fully the role that spike protein variation has upon human coronavirus 229E re-infection, further work is required. In particular, sequencing of the spike genes from other chronologically and geographically distinct human coronaviruses 229E should be undertaken.
