            "text": "Terminal sialic acids on cell surface glycoconjugates can carry 9-O -acetyl esters. For technical reasons, it has previously been difficult to determine their precise distribution on different cell types. Using a recombinant soluble form of the Influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase as a probe for 9-O -acetylated sialic acids, we demonstrate here their preferential expression on the CD4 T cell lineage in normal B10.A mouse lymphoid organs. Of total thymocytes, 8-10% carry 9-O -acetylation; the great majority of these are the more mature PNA \u03ea , HSA \u03ea , and TCR hi medullary cells. While low levels of 9-O -acetylation are seen on some CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) and CD8 single positive (SP) cells, high levels are present primarily on 80-85% of CD4 SP cells. Correlation with CD4 and CD8 levels suggests that 9-O -acetylation appears as an early differentiation marker as cells mature from the DP to the CD4 SP phenotype. This high degree of 9-O -acetylation is also present on 90-95% of peripheral spleen and lymph node CD4 T cells. In contrast, only a small minority of CD8 T cells and B cells show such levels of 9-O -acetylation. Among mature peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes, the highly O -acetylated cells are Mel 14 hi , CD44 lo , and CD45R(exon B) hi , features typical of naive cells. Digestions with trypsin and O -sialoglycoprotease (OSGPase) and ELISA studies of lipid extracts indicate that the 9-O -acetylated sialic acids on peripheral CD4 T cells are predominantly on O-linked mucintype glycoproteins and to a lesser degree, on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides). In contrast, sialic acids on mucin type molecules of CD8 T cells are not O -acetylated; instead these molecules mask the recognition of O -acetylated gangliosides that seem to be present at similar levels as on CD4 cells. The 9-O -acetylated gangliosides on mouse T cells are not bound by CD60 antibodies, which recognize O -acetylated gangliosides in human T cells. Tethering 9-O -acetylated mucins with the Influenza C probe with or without secondary cross-linking did not cause activation of CD4 T cells. However, activation by other stimuli including TCR ligation is associated with a substantial decrease in surface 9-O -acetylation, primarily in the mucin glycoprotein component. Thus, 9-O -acetylation of sialic acids on cell surface mucins is a novel marker on CD4 T cells that appears on maturation and is modulated downwards upon activation.",

            "text": "S ialic acids (Sia) 1 are a family of 9-carbon negatively charged sugars usually found at terminal positions of mammalian cell surface sugar chains. Sias can be attached to underlying glycoconjugates in a variety of linkages, and modified in many different ways (1, 2) . These modifications were once thought to be rare, species-specific curiosities. However, recent evidence has shown that some modifications are more widely distributed than previously thought (2, 3) . For example, Sias often carry O -acetyl substitutions at the C-7 or C-9 positions (1-4). Since O -acetyl esters at C-7 position will spontaneously migrate to the C-9 position at physiologic extracellular pH (5, 6), 9-O -acetylated Sias predominate on cell surface glycoconjugates (7) . Identification of the cells and sialoglycoconjugates bearing 9-Oacetylation has been technically challenging, since these esters are often present on only a fraction of total sialic acids, and biochemical purification steps can be accompanied by varying losses of O -acetylation.",

            "text": "Taking advantage of the binding and catalytic property of the Influenza C virion's hemagglutinin-esterase (CHE) protein for 9-O -acetylated sialic acids, we had earlier engineered a recombinant soluble form of the extracellular domain of CHE (CHE-Fc) with a human IgG 1 Fc region fused to the carboxyl end (3) . Treatment of this molecule with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) selectively abrogates its esterase activity (CHE-FcD) while preserving the binding property (3, 18) . Thus, the probe is a bifunctional tool for either selectively removing (CHE-Fc) or specifically detecting (CHE-FcD) 9-O -acetyl esters. In studying mouse peripheral leukocytes with this probe, we noted high binding to CD4 T cells and much less binding to CD8 T cells. Apart from the CD4 molecule itself, we are unaware of any other cell surface marker that is selectively expressed on CD4 cells in comparison to CD8 cells. We therefore decided to further delineate the presence and distribution of 9-O -acetylated sialic acids on cells of the murine T cell lineage. Indeed, we find that 9-O -acetylation of sialic acids is a novel cell surface marker which appears during differentiation of CD4 single positive T cells in the thymus, persists at high levels on these cells in the periphery, and decreases in expression upon cellular activation. We have also used the enzymes trypsin and O-sialoglycoprotease (OSGPase) (19) to explore the distribution of these modified sialic acids on the different classes of glycoconjugates found on CD4 cell surfaces. The latter enzyme is particularly useful because it selectively cleaves mucin-type glycoproteins with clustered sialylated O-linked sugar chains (20) , such as CD43 and some CD45 forms (21) .",

The CHE-FcD \u03e9 anti-human IgG Fc immunocomplex was allowed to bind to the cells for 2 h on ice. For all double and triple-color stainings, the CHE-FcD probe was allowed to bind to the cells before staining with the remaining antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. The CHE-Fc was used under identical conditions as a negative control for CHE-FcD binding. In studies where cells had to be de-O -acetylated before staining, CHE-Fc was used at a final concentration of 10 g/ml in a volume of 50 l of staining buffer containing 3-5 \u03eb 10 6 cells and incubated at 37 \u040a C for 1 h. For trypsinization, cells were incubated in 0.1% trypsin with 0.5 mM EDTA in Hank's balanced salt solution for 1 h in a 37 \u040a C water bath, then washed twice with cold PBS before staining. The loss of anti-CD4 binding was used to confirm trypsin activity. For treatment with OSGPase (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Ontario, Canada) 5 \u03eb 10 6 live cells in 100 l of staining buffer were incubated with 5 l of the reconstituted enzyme at 37 \u040a C for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS before staining. Decrease in CHE-FcD binding to murine erythroleukemia cells following OSGPase treatment was used as a positive control for this enzyme (data not shown). Following staining, cells were washed with excess staining buffer and fixed in PBS containing 1% formaldehyde (fixing buffer). Stained fixed cells were kept in dark at 4 \u040a C and analyzed by flow cytometry the same day.",

While the degree of 9-O-acetylation on thymocytes ranges over 3 log scales of fluorescence intensity ( Fig. 1 A, middle), we noticed that the total percentage of CHE-FcD \u03e9 thymocytes tended to correlate best with the percentage of CD4 single positive (SP) cells in the same preparation. Indeed, upon three-color analysis of the 9-O-acetyl \u03e9 cells, a large fraction of these were found to be CD4 \u03e9 SP cells (Fig. 2) . In contrast to a high intensity of staining in CD4 \u03e9 SP cells, the degree of 9-O-acetylation was low in the other cell types, except for some enrichment in the CD4 \u03ea CD8 \u03ea double negative (DN) cells. Further analyses showed that 9-O-acetylation is present on \u202b%57\u0641\u202c of all the CD4 \u03e9 SP cells, 40% of the DN cells and only 8% of CD8 \u03e9 SP cells (Fig. 3) . The density of 9-O-acetylation on the 9-Oacetyl \u03e9 DN cells is relatively lower than that on the CD4 \u03e9 SP cells (Fig. 3) . Given the heterogeneity of DN thymocytes with respect to maturity (24), we cannot be certain which subpopulation of these cells are 9-O-acetylated. Regardless, the lowest amount of 9-O-acetylation was seen in the CD4 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 double positive (DP) thymocytes (1-2%). Thereafter, there is a progressive increase in 9-O-acetyla- tion as the cells mature from the DP stage through the CD4 \u03e9 SP stage. In contrast, the cells progressing towards the CD8 \u03e9 lineage show minimal increase. Cells in the CD4 \u03e9 SP subset varied in levels of 9-O-acetylation; these levels correlated inversely with CD8 levels (Fig. 3) . Thus, increasing cell surface 9-O-acetylation is correlated with the progression of maturation of CD4 \u03e9 thymocytes.",

CD4 \u03e9 thymocytes were selectively gated to study the relationship of 9-O-acetylation with other well defined traits that mark the progression of cells from DP to CD4 \u03e9 CD8 \u03ea stage (Fig. 4) . Increasing 9-O-acetylation was correlated with increasing expression of TCR and decreasing levels of HSA, indicating that these CD4 cells have been committed for further maturation after the DP stage. Thymocyte maturation to a CD4 \u03e9 SP stage occurs with upregulation of CD5 and CD69, both of which are responsive to signals delivered through the TCR during positive selection (25) (26) (27) . While the increase in CD5 expression remains stable, CD69 is an early T cell activation marker, being initially high during the CD4 hi CD8 lo stage and decreasing to lower levels in the CD4 \u03e9 SP cells. Most transitional cells between the DP and the CD4 SP stages and almost all the CD4 \u03e9 SP cells have a CD5 hi phenotype, which fits our observation that most of the 9-O-acetyl \u03e9 cells are also CD5 hi (Fig. 4) . The 9-O-acetyl lo CD5 lo cells are most probably the transitional cells. Although more of the 9-O-acetyl hi cells are CD69 \u03ea , the 9-O-acetyl \u03e9 cells as a whole appear to be equally divided with respect to CD69 expression, implying that 9-O-acetylation does not identify cells purely based on their activation state. Together, these results show that CD4 \u03e9 thymocytes are the major carriers of 9-O-acetylation, and that expression progressively increases with maturation in the thymus.",

Trypsinization of thymocytes caused partial loss of 9-O-acetylation in most of the positive cells ( Fig. 7 A, bottom) . Likewise, when FACS \u00ae -sorted CD4 \u03e9 SP cells were trypsin-treated, there was a significant decrease in 9-O-acetylation (nearly a fivefold decrease in mean fluorescence intensity). Most glycoproteins are expected to be trypsin sensitive, while the trypsin-resistant 9-O-acetylated glycoconjugates are likely to be sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides). One important subset of cell surface glycoproteins are mucins with clustered sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides (which includes CD43 and some isoforms of CD45) (31, 32) . These can be selectively eliminated by the enzyme OSGPase (19) , an endopeptidase that will only cleave mucins (20, 21) . Upon treatment of thymocytes with OSGPase ( Fig. 7 A, middle) , there was a marked decrease in 9-Oacetylation (nearly a fivefold decrease in mean fluorescence intensity) indicating that many of the 9-O-acetyl groups are on Sias attached to O-linked oligosaccharides of mucin-type glycoproteins (murine erythroleukemia cells (15) served as positive controls for this enzyme, data not shown). The substantial loss of the high 9-O-acetylated CD4 \u03e9 SP cells with OSGPase treatment indicates that mucin-type glycoproteins are the major carriers for 9-O-acetylation in these cells.",

The binding of the probe to the lipids on the plate was abrogated by base treatment, indicating the presence of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides in the extracts (Fig 8) . One of the better studied 9-O-acetylated gangliosides is 9-O-acetylated G D3 , which has recently been shown to occur on human peripheral T cells as one of the epitopes in the CD60 cluster (33) . This molecule was not detectable on mouse thymocytes or on mouse peripheral CD4 T cells using both JONES and 27A antibodies (data not shown). However, these antibodies are highly specific for 9-O-acetylated G D3 , and would not detect many other 9-O-acetylated gangliosides. We therefore tried 8A2, a mAb that recognizes certain other larger 9-O-acetylated gangliosides in human melanoma cells (34) . This antibody was also unable to bind to mouse thymocytes and peripheral CD4 T cells (data not shown). There is also no correlation between 9-O-acetylation and the presence or absence of epitopes recognized by antibody SM3G11 (35, 36) , which is known to detect the mouse T cell ganglioside G D1c (data not shown). These data suggest that while certain gangliosides on murine CD4 cells constitute a significant proportion of total 9-O-acetylated molecules, they must be structurally distinct from those reported as CD60 markers on human T cells.",

Given the preponderance of 9-O-acetylated sialomucins on CD4 T cells we looked for their presence on CD8 T cells. As shown in Fig. 10 A, removal of the sialomucins by OSGPase actually gives an increase in CHE-FcD binding to CD8 T cells, i.e., the opposite of the result with CD4 T cells. The same result was confirmed by treating cells with trypsin ( Fig. 10 A) or by a combination of trypsin followed by OSGPase (data not shown) indicating that detection of protease resistant 9-O-acetylated gangliosides can be masked by the presence of sialomucins on CD8 cells. This pattern of increased CHE-FcD binding after trypsin or OSGPase treatment was also reproduced on CD8 SP thymocytes (Fig. 10 B) .

To study the effect of trypsin on CHE-FcD binding to CD4 \u03e9 SP cells, CD4 \u03e9 SP thymocytes were first FACSorted \u00ae after two-color staining with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies, prior to CHE-FcD staining. (B) CD4 cells from peripheral lymph nodes were purified by FACSorting \u00ae and treated with trypsin or OSGPase and then washed before staining (left). One aliquot of these cells were activated by cross-linking with anti-CD3 on a 96-well plate; the profiles displayed in the right panels represent gated CD4 cells from the third day after activation; similar patterns were seen thereafter for 10 d (data not shown). In each case, the percentage positivity of the cells is shown within the histogram display, and background level of staining is represented by the dashed line.",

Amongst various antibodies recognizing the CD45RB isoforms, the 23G2 clone had shown better binding on splenic CD4 T cells (41) . Since these were the cells we were focusing on, we chose this antibody for all FACS \u00ae and Western blot studies, conceding the fact that this antibody would be specific to only a major subset of all CD45 isoforms. Fig. 11 shows that CD43 and CD45(exon B) coded isoforms are sialomucins, since OSGPase treatment of both CD4 and CD8 T cell surfaces almost completely destroys their binding to the respective antibodies. This was further confirmed by Western blot analysis of T cell membrane protein extracts treated with or without OSGPase, using anti-CD43 and anti-CD45RB antibodies (data not shown). These results are in agreement with earlier reports using methods such as Western blots and/or FACS \u00ae analysis that describe loss of CD43 recognition with OSGPase treatment (21) and CD45RB epitopes by O-glycanase (40) or OSGPase digestions (21) . As evaluated by mean fluorescence intensity of staining at varying dilutions of the antibodies, expression of these cell surface glycoproteins actually showed higher levels of both CD43 and CD45R(exonB) containing isoforms on CD8 T cells than on CD4 cells (data not shown). This observation is consistent with earlier results using the same anti-CD43 S7 clone (43) and anti-CD45RB (41) . The data in Fig. 11 shows the relative abundance of these glycoproteins on CD8 T cells in comparison to CD4 T cells at saturating levels of antibodies. Thus, the differences in sialomucin 9-O-acetylation is not due to differences in the levels of expression of the parent molecules between CD4 and CD8 cells.",

The specificity of recognition is confirmed by the absence of any binding with the CHE-Fc at similar concentration (data not shown). Pre-incubation of the proteins with OSGPase destroys all the positive bands, confirming that sialomucins are the major 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins in these cells. Two of the major bands coincided in molecular mass with that expected for CD45RB and CD43. To evaluate this matter further, 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins were precipitated from the total membrane protein extracts using CHE-FcD bound to protein A-Sepharose via its human IgG Fc tail. The CHE-Fc protein was used as a control for any nonspecific precipitation. The bound proteins were separated on a reducing SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with monoclonal antibodies recognising CD43 and CD45R (exon B) isoforms. Fig. 12 demonstrates that the proteins precipitated by CHE-FcD include molecules recognized by anti-CD43 and by anti-CD45RB, that comigrate at the same position with bands from total membrane proteins recognized by the same antibodies. The weaker intensity of the bands reflects the lower amounts of CD43 and CD45 gives the expected band of 190 kD (and some weaker bands above), anti-CD43 detects a band migrating slightly below the bulk population of molecules. This might be due to differential mobilities of different CD43 glycoforms (43) . The bright band seen at \u202b021\u0641\u202c kD with the CD43 probe is nonspecific, since it was present on blots probed with alkalinephosphatase conjugated neutravidin alone, and also with the CD45RB probe (data not shown). Upon probing the material precipitated with CHE-FcD, and comparing the profile with the CHE-FcD Western blot from the untreated total protein extracts, it was clear that not all 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins were precipitated (data not shown); this may be due to the fact that only a single round of depletion was done or be due to the differential affinity of CHE-FcD for various 9-O-acetylated proteins. Regardless, it is evident from these data that CD43 and CD45(exonB) are among the cell surface mucins that are 9-O-acetylated.",

Earlier studies in our lab showed that 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids could mask the binding of recombinant soluble CD22 (CD22Rg) to its ligands on some cells in murine lymphoid organs (16) . We found high amounts of CD22Rg ligands on peripheral T cells and on CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 SP thymocytes, and lower amounts on immature thymocytes by flow cytometry (data not shown). Treatment with CHE-Fc did not significantly increase the binding of CD22Rg to either mature peripheral CD4 cells or to CD4 \u03e9 SP thymocytes (data not shown). This result is consistent with the fact that most of the 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins on CD4 cells have mucin type O-linked structures which are unlikely to carry the Sia \u24232-6Gal\u24241-4 GlcNAc sequence typical of CD22 ligands (44) . Mouse spleen cells were stained with CHE-FcD before or after OSGPase or trypsin treatment and staining profiles were traced from gated CD4 and CD8 subpopulations. Trypsin treatment was done on CD4 and CD8 T cells that were pre-sorted on a FACSorter \u00ae . Loss of binding of anti-Mel14 was a positive control for trypsinization (data not shown). (B) Mouse thymocytes were treated with OSGPase as described earlier, washed and stained with anti-CD4, CD8, and CHE-FcD. Sham treated cells were incubated with an equal volume of buffer under identical conditions. 100,000 live events were acquired and CD4 and CD8 SP cells were gated from a CD4/CD8 dot plot. CHE-FcD binding within those populations was plotted in the histograms. The dotted line shows background staining with the second antibody. Figure 11 . CD43 and CD45RB are sialomucins expressed on both CD8 cells and on CD4 cells. Freshly isolated mouse splenic lymphocytes were incubated with OSGPase or with buffer alone, under identical conditions. This was followed by three-color staining with anti-CD4, CD8, and either anti-CD43 (S7) or CD45RB (23G2) at dilutions of 5 g/ml.

It is now known that they occur in several tissues of neuroectodermal and mesenchymal descent (2) .

Earlier studies showed by indirect methods that mouse thymocytes might have 9-Oacetylated sialic acids (51) . It was also reported that T cells from patients with various malignancies had O-acetylated sialic acids (52, 53) and that 9-O-acetylation was present on pig lymphocytes (54) . However, the extraction methods used could not specifically distinguish cell surface 9-O-acetylation. Other assays involved the use of intact influenza C virions that specifically recognize 9-O-acetylated sialic acids (18, 55) . This approach is limited by the purity and stability of the virus preparations and a relatively high background. The availability of a soluble recombinant chimera (CHE-FcD) derived from influenza C and its versatility in a variety of in vitro assays (3) makes it possible to look for 9-Oacetylation on cell surfaces, irrespective of the underlying sugar structure. We have studied here the cell surface expression of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on intact fresh lymphocytes isolated from normal mice. While B lymphocytes and CD8 T lymphocytes were heterogenous in their expression of low levels of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids, the singular pattern of high density expression on CD4 T cells led to the current set of investigations.",

In keeping with this, we show that the acquisition of the 9-O-acetylation phenotype occurs almost entirely within a subset of PNA \u03ea mature thymocytes. A low percentage of thymocytes are positive yet highly heterogenous in their cell surface density of 9-O-acetylation, with a disproportionately higher percentage of CD4 \u03e9 SP cells and CD4 \u03ea CD8 \u03ea DN cells and a lower percentage of CD4 \u03e9 CD8 \u03e9 DP cells. Thus, it seems that 9-O-acetylation of Sia on mucins must be very specifically regulated during T cell ontogeny (Fig. 13) . In this regard, it is notable that other changes in glycosylation during maturation of thymocytes have been demonstrated, including varying patterns of expression of four different glycosyltransferases on cells with significant phenotypic and functional differences (56, 57) .",

During this stage, the TCR-\u2424 locus undergoes rearrangement and cells that undergo productive rearrangement are likely selected for further progress to the DP stage characterized by increasing surface expression of TCR. During the transition from DN to DP stage, thymocytes undergo several rounds of proliferation, upregulate TCR-\u2423 rearrangement, stop TCR-\u2424 rearrangement, and begin to turn on CD4 and CD8 expression. Since we did not do a full phenotypic characterization of The conspicuous upregulation of cell surface mucin 9-O-acetylation as thymocytes mature to CD4 \u03e9 CD8 \u03ea stage from the DP stage establishes this as a novel marker identifying cells committed to the CD4 lineage (Figs. 13 and 14) . In contrast, there is only a small increase in 9-O-acetylation on the CD8 \u03e9 SP cells, and this is not found on mucins. During lineage commitment, DP thymocytes undergo several sequential changes in expression of CD69, HSA, and CD5. CD4 \u03e9 thymocytes that are CD69 \u03e9 CHE-FcD \u03ea represent cells that are still in the DP stage. Thymocytes with low amounts of 9-O-acetylation are either CD69 \u03e9 or CD69 \u03ea suggesting the 9-O-acetylation phenotype of the maturing CD4 \u03e9 cells is not specifically associated with this early activation marker. A significant fraction of cells with high 9-O-acetylation that must be CD4 \u03e9 SP cells seem to have lost their CD69 expression, which fits in with their expected downregulation on mature SP thymocytes. A strong correlation of CD5 hi TCR hi HSA \u03ea pattern of expression with increasing surface 9-O-acetylation suggests that O-acetylation identifies cells that have successfully been selected and are on their way to becoming mature cells.",

It is unclear if the increase in CD4 \u03e9 cell 9-O-acetylation occurs at a peripheral location after emigration from the thymus, or if 9-Oacetyl hi CD4 \u03e9 SP cells are selectively exported from the thymus. Functionally distinct subpopulations in CD4 SP cells have been reported. One study showed the late CD4 hi thymocytes were functionally more mature than their immediate precursors in several assays. They were able to colonize and expand in the peripheral lymphoid organs while the CD4 hi CD8 lo subset had an obligatory requirement for thymic microenvironment for further maturation (59) . T cells need to express homing molecules to enter the thymic lymphatics or venules and exit at the corticomedullary junction. Such molecules must be expressed at the SP stage after migration from the cortex through the corticomedullary junction into the medulla where they would undergo negative selection. Surviving cells would, in addition to being activated to divide, express homing receptors probably influenced by the local microenvironment. Assuming that a critical threshold of homing receptors is required for a mature SP cell to emigrate, the progressive increase in cell surface 9-O-acetylation in the CD4 SP lineage is a candidate for subserving such a function.",

More than 95% of the naive CD4 T cells and only \u202b%06\u0641\u202c of the cells with a memory/activated phenotype are 9-O-acetylated. This could be relevant either to the specific recirculation patterns of these cells in the mouse and/or recognition of some costimulatory molecule involved in T cell activation. Thus, 9-O-acetylated sialic acids could recognize a specific ligand in the milieu the T cells expose themselves to, or this modification could mask recognition of the underlying carbohydrate structure on T cells by an unknown receptor. Fig. 13 summarizes the differential distribution of total 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on peripheral resting and activated CD4 T cells as detected by CHE-FcD. We know of no other cell surface marker (other than CD4 itself) described to date that specifically identifies the murine CD4 lineage.

The susceptibility of the 9-O-acetylated glycoconjugates to the various enzyme treatments suggests that most 9-O-acetylated thymocytes have both 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins and gangliosides. In contrast to the naive population where mucins are the major carriers of 9-O-acetylation, in vitro activated CD4 T cells appear to carry them primarily on protease-resistant molecules (presumably gangliosides). Although there is a substantial decrease in the mean density of 9-O-acetylation on the activated cells, there is no significant difference in the percentage of cells that are 9-O-acetylated. The presence of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides in the resting and activated CD4 T cells was confirmed in an ELISA using the CHE-FcD. Further studies will be needed to define their precise structure.",

Although sialomucins are the predominant 9-O-acetylated molecules on CD4 T cells, these do not seem to be O-acetylated in the case of CD8 T cells. This is not due to a quantitative difference in the amount of cell surface mucins, if anything, the cell surface densities of two prominent sialomucins CD43 and CD45 (exon B isoforms) on CD8 cells are actually higher than on CD4 T cells. Because of their rod-like rigid structure, mucin molecules on both CD4 and CD8 T cells could physically restrict the binding of CHE-FcD to the O-acetylated gangliosides that are closer to the cell membrane. Indeed, such an unmasking effect of OSGPase and trypsin on CHE-FcD binding is particularly obvious on the CD8 T cells. It is unclear how two developmentally closely related cell types differ so radically in this sialic acid modification. It might be due to differences in the regulation of O-acetyltransferase gene expression or in the underlying sialic acid linkages on the same mucin molecules between the cell types.",

Rather, this enzyme specifically recognizes clustered sialic acid residues on O-linked glycans and cleaves the peptide bonds close to the O-linked structures. Thus, while the CD8 molecule itself is modified by O-linked glycosylation, it is resistant to this protease, because the sugar chains are not clustered. Fig. 14 summarizes the concept evolving from our observations. Recognition of T cell surface gangliosides by a soluble or a neighboring cell surface receptor might be modulated by expression of mucin-like structures on T cells. These mucins may or may not themselves bear a similar carbohydrate epitope to that carried on the gangliosides. With respect to 9-O-acetylation, this attribute is so well demarcated between CD4 and CD8 cells that it might be of some relevance to their biology. Although no well-defined receptors for 9-O-acetylated glycoconjugates have been documented, such a masking phenomenon in vivo could, in principle, prevent the recognition of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides on resting T cells. Furthermore, it is clear from our data from activated CD4 T cells this masking can be modulated by the state of T cell differentiation. Assuming there might be differences in physiological consequence mediated by receptors recognizing 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on sialomucins and gangliosides, such a masking on CD4 cells could be biologically relevant. Regardless of their biological significance, these results underscore the possibility that macromolecular probes for cell surface glycolipids may fail to detect their ligands because of shielding by the larger sialomucins on the same surface (62, 63) .",

It is heavily glycosylated and the O-glycans attached to it can vary with both the cell type and within T cells based on their state of differentiation (32, 64) . Differences in the expression of its two major glycoforms 115 Figure 14 . Model depicting the likely differential distribution of 9-Oacetylated sialoglycoconjugates between resting peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells. Sialomucins are present on both CD8 and CD4 cells, but are only 9-O-acetylated in the latter. Cell surface sialomucin molecules usually have a rod like extended conformation and a high negative charge, and appears to prevent CHE-FcD access to O-acetylated glycolipids (gangliosides) that are much closer to the cell surface membrane. OSGPase recognizes sialylated clustered O-linked glycans and cleaves the adjacent polypeptide backbone, thus unmasking recognition of the enzyme-resistant O-acetylated gangliosides by the CHE-FcD probe. 2010 9-O-acetylation in CD4 Cells and the 130-kD species, have been shown between CD4 and CD8 T cells (43, 65) . Our results suggest that 9-Oacetylation of CD43 occurs differently on CD4 and CD8 T cells. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the expression of the 130-kD isoform of CD43 shows an inverse correlation with 9-O-acetylation; it is preferentially upregulated on thymocytes committed to CD8 SP cells while being low on CD4 SP thymocytes, and then prevails at high levels on most peripheral CD8 T and lower levels on about 20% of CD4 T cells (43) . Furthermore the 130-kD isoform is markedly upregulated on human CD4 T cells upon activation. A thorough glycosylation analysis of the two murine CD43 isoforms needs to be done before one can speculate on how this could affect 9-O-acetylation on sialic acids.",

Using intact influenza C virus, uncharacterized 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins have been demonstrated by Western blots derived from human T cells (55) . Human peripheral blood T lymphocytes are also positive for the marker CD60, which represents G D3 -related gangliosides with 9-O-acetylation (33, 37) . This antibody binds to \u202b%52\u0641\u202c of normal circulating human T lymphocytes and to most T cells infiltrating psoriatic skin lesions and the synovial fluid space in rheumatoid arthritis (68, 69) . In patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma, a majority of circulating T cells and in dermal lesions were also positive for this marker (70) . Staining of mouse T cells with specific antibodies for 9-O-acetylated G D3 did not give any positive results. Thus, while 9-O-acetylation of Sia appears common to human and murine lymphocytes, it must be carried on distinct glycolipids. Interestingly, most reported gangliosides in mouse T cells such as G D1a and G D1\u2423 arise from the a or \u2423 series biosynthetic pathways (71, 72) and there is no evidence for G D3 , or any other member from the b series pathway. Recently, the presence of an unique ganglioside G D1c sharing the same terminal trisaccharide with G D3 has been identified by mAbs 3G11 (36) and YK-3 (73) on mouse T cells with a preference for cells with a T h1 pheno-type (73) . It is possible that this structure is the functional homologue of G D3 seen on human peripheral T cells. Unfortunately, there is no antibody currently available against 9-O-acetylated G D1c . It must also be remembered that most sialic acids in the mouse have a N-glycolyl group attached to the fifth carbon atom instead of the N-acetyl group found in humans (1); this change can also influence recognition by antibodies.",

A mAb U5 preferentially recognizing 7-O-acetylated-G D3 on human CD4 and CD8 T cells could elicit a even stronger proliferative response from these cells (74) . Since mouse peripheral T cells showed no evidence of 9-O-acetyl-G D3 , we studied CD4 T cells activation with bound or soluble forms of CHE-FcD that would cross-link any 9-O-acetylated cell surface molecule. We also looked for any potentiation of PMA induced mitogenicity of CD4 T cells as reported earlier with CD60 antibodies on human T cells (37) (38) (39) . While we did not see activation, this could be because CHE-FcD binding to sialomucins is blocking access to glycolipids. There was also no effect in potentiating anti-CD3-mediated T cell activation (Fig. 9 ). Since CHE-FcD binds to any cell surface glycoconjugate bearing 9-O-acetylated sialic acids it might be hard to assess the effect of simultaneous binding to a variety of different molecules on T cell activation. A specific mAb directed against the 9-O-Ac-gangliosides in murine T cells would be needed to make a valid comparison with CD60 activation in human T cells.",

Several factors could regulate the extent of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids. An earlier study demonstrated 9-O-acetylation on murine erythrocyte sialic acids could be regulated by an autosomal dominant gene and its expression can thus depend on the genetic background of the animal being studied (14) . Our group recently reported 9-O-acetylation on Chinese hamster ovary cells was dependent on the availability of the correct linkage of the sialic acid to the underlying sugar chain (50) . Such observations coupled with the present findings are strong predictors for a functional role of 9-Oacetylated sialic acids. It remains to be seen how the remarkably different 9-O-acetylation of sialomucins on mouse CD4 and CD8 cells might influence the in vivo biology of those cells.",
