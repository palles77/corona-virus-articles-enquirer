Methods: Between February 15, 2011 and January 18, 2012, 371 pediatric patients with CAP were enrolled at Beijing Children's Hospital. Sixteen respiratory viruses and two bacteria were detected from tracheal aspirate specimens using commercially available multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits. Results: A single viral pathogen was detected in 35.3% of enrolled patients, multiple viruses in 11.6%, and virus/bacteria coinfection in 17.8%. In contrast, only 6.5% of patients had a single bacterial pathogen and 2.2% were infected with multiple bacteria. The etiological agent was unknown for 26.7% of patients. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (43.9%), rhinovirus (14.8%), parainfluenza virus (9.4%), and adenovirus (8.6%). In patients under three years of age, RSV (44.6%), rhinovirus (12.8%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.9%) were the most frequent pathogens. In children aged 3e7 years, S. pneumoniae (38.9%), RSV (30.6%), Haemophilus influenzae (19.4%), and adenovirus (19.4%) were most prevalent. Finally in children over seven years, RSV (47.3%), S. pneumoniae (41.9%), and rhinovirus (21.5%) infections were most frequent. Conclusions: Viral pathogens, specifically RSV, were responsible for the majority of CAP in pediatric patients. However, both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae contributed as major causes of disease. Commercially available multiplexing real-time PCR allowed for rapid detection of the etiological agent.",

However, it is time-consuming and it takes 7e12 days to obtain a positive culture. Enzyme immunoassays and immunofluorescence give rapid results, but, their relative lack of sensitivity and the availability of reactive antisera can be limiting factors. 14 Advances in conventional RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR assays have greatly facilitated the etiological study of respiratory infections due to their higher sensitivity and specificity. These assays can also reduce labor and cost by detecting more than one pathogen in a single reaction by using multiple probes. 15 There are several commercial multiplex assays available; such as xTAG RVP from Luminex, Multicode-PLx RVP from EraGen Biosciences, and ResPlex II from Qiagen.

The kits were able to detect 16 respiratory viruses and two bacteria. We compared the specificity and sensitivity of this kit with singleplex conventional PCR 16 and a commercial multiplex conventional PCR kit (Seeplex \u00ae RV15 ACE Detection kit, Seegene, South Korea) using 73 throat swab specimens from upper respiratory tract infection cases. The positive factor numbers of singleplex conventional PCR, conventional multiplex PCR and multiplex real-time PCR were 56, 41 and 87, respectively (Data not published). The factors detected only by the multiplex real-time PCR assay were confirmed using previously published methods. 17 Using the multiplex real-time PCR assay the etiological agents could be identified within three hours of receiving the clinical samples. We chose to use the multiplex assay for its sensitivity, specify, and rapidity of the results.",

The respiratory pathogens in 96 pairs of throat swabs and tracheal aspirate specimens were detected using the commercial multiplex real-time PCR kits. The Ct values for hits from tracheal aspirate specimens were usually lower than that from throat swabs (Data not published). Similar to previously published work, 18 this indicated that viral loads in tracheal aspirate specimens were higher than in throat swabs. In addition, throat swabs are commonly used clinically for identifying respiratory viruses. However, these samples are not always appropriate for the detection of disease associated with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae which can be found in healthy carriers. Tracheal aspirate specimens were chosen for this study to reflect the true incidence of respiratory pathogens in pediatric CAP patients in Beijing.",

In fact the incidence of RSV was two times higher than S. pneumoniae (n \u00bc 77) that was the second leading cause of CAP. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequent pathogen detected in all three age groups. Rhinovirus is another frequently detected viral agent that causes adult acute respiratory infection in temperate regions. 21 Likewise, rhinovirus was also detected in this study in pediatric CAP patients.
