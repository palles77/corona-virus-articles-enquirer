In Africa alone, around 20% childhood deaths are due to malaria and a child dies every 30 s [2] and it is estimated that an African child has on an average 1.6e5.4 episodes of malaria fever each year. Of the four typically recognized Plasmodium species causing disease in humans, Plasmodium falciparum is most deadly to children below the age of five leading to mortality while Plasmodium vivax is most morbidity prone, and is responsible for latent infection that hampers current control and future elimination efforts [3] . The development of drug resistance for the common antimalarials such as 4-/ 8-aminoquinolines, 4-methanol quinolines, antifolate drugs, sesquiterpene lactones etc. (Fig. 1) is a rather serious issue which has stimulated considerable research efforts in the development of new drugs using different approaches [4, 5] of which the molecular hybridization approach [6, 7] is quite an attractive strategy which involves design of new chemical entities by covalent fusion of two drugs, both active compounds and/or pharmacophoric units derived from known bioactive molecules with complimentary activities and multiple pharmacological targets. The multiple target strategy led to the design of hybrid of 4-aminoquinoline with species such as triazine [8, 9] , ferrocene [10] , rhodanine [11] , thiazolidine-4-one [12] , chalcone [13] , trioxane [14] , isatin [15] and recently, pyrimidines [16e18] (Fig. 2) .",

In yet another report on the evaluation of quinolineepyrimidine, the activity (in micromolar range) was also reported for fixed combinations of the chloroquine and pyrimethamine. In all these reports, the pyrimidines were linked to the quinoline unit through 2-, 4-and 6-positions. We have employed rather conformationally flexible pyrimidine-5-carboxylates linked covalently to 4-aminoquinoline core. These novel pyrimidine carboxylate hybrids interact with the iron center of free heme within the physiological environment (pH 5.6), a key step in the accumulation of heme which is selectively toxic to the parasite. To enhance the possibility to accumulate within the digestive vacuole via weak-base trapping (the mechanism by which CQ and other quinoline antimalarials attain high concentrations inside this compartment), we developed a novel class of antimalarials using a pharmacophore hybridization approach in which the pyrimidine-5-carboxylate motif was hybridized with an iron-complexing, 4-aminoquinoline moiety through C-2 position [29] . To further elaborate the structureeactivity profile, here, we present additional new 4-aminoquinolineepyrimidine carboxylate hybrids. We also report on their antimalarial activity against both CQ sensitive (CQ s Dd2) as well as CQ resistant (CQ R D10) strains. Finally, the mechanism of action studies with the representative compounds has also been performed.",

Although the tested hybrids were not as active as the standard drugs viz. CQ and ASN, interesting SARs have been drawn. Analysis of the activity of the compounds recorded in Table 1 reveals that replacing C-5 ethyl ester of the previously reported [29] decrease in antimalarial activity against both the chloroquine sensitive and chloroquine resistant strains of P. falciparum. However, comparison of hybrids 5b, 5c with 6b, 6c having an identical butyl spacer showed that incorporation of isopropyl ester at C-5 of pyrimidine motif (5b and 6b) increased the antimalarial activity against the CQ S strain whereas considerable decrease in activity was observed for CQ R strain of P. falciparum. Also, the most potent compound 5b of the series displayed 2-fold increase in antimalarial activity than the standard CQ against CQ R strain of P. falciparum. When the diaminoalkyl linker of compound 6a was replaced with relatively less basic alkoxy amino linker 5d considerable decrease in antimalarial activity was observed which in turn linked to the decreased accumulation of compound via pH trapping into the digestive vacuole. It was not unexpected since the basicity of alkyl chain linker plays crucial role in determining the antimalarial activity of this class of compounds. Furthermore, the introduction of a nitro substituent on the phenyl ring at the C-4 position of the pyrimidine core to create 5c resulted in a significant increase in antiplasmodial activity in comparison to the p-chloro/p-fluoro substituents (5e and 5f). Moreover, the hybrid 5g lacking a C-4 substituent on the pyrimidine motif led to an increase in antimalarial activity against both the CQ S as well as CQ R strains of P. falciparum. However, although the antimalarial activity of 5g was superior to 5c, 5e & 5f, it was less than the corresponding C-4 phenyl substituted analogs 5b as well as 6b.",

In this study, we have evaluated the mechanism of antimalarial activity of the most potent compound 5b of the series by studying its binding with heme (Fig. 4) . The titration of monomeric heme was also performed at the Plasmodial food vacuole pH 5.6 using MES buffer instead of HEPES to ensure that the compound 5b binds with heme even at acidic pH (S1). A 1:1 stoichiometry of the most stable complex of 5b with monomeric heme at pH 7.4 and 5.6 was established from the Job's plot (SI Figure S1 ). The association constants (Table 3) were calculated by analyzing the titration curves obtained at pH 7.4 using HypSpecea non-linear least square fitting programme [39] . The binding of CQ with heme under identical conditions was also determined in the similar manner and the results are presented in Table 3 for comparison. Table 3 shows that the association constants for the complexes formed between monomeric heme and 5b (log K 4.96) are comparable with those of standard antimalarial drug, CQ (log K 5.15). Furthermore, the decrease of apparent pH from 7.4 to 5.6 ( Table 3) has little effect on the binding constants indicating binding is stronger even at acidic pH.",

            "text": "The mechanism of many antimalarial drugs such as CQ, quinacrine and quinine relies upon the interaction with DNA presumably through ionic interactions between phosphate groups of DNA and protonated amine in addition to the interactions between aromatic nuclei of the drug with nucleotide bases [40, 41] . Therefore, the DNA binding properties of 4-aminoquinolineepyrimidine hybrids have been evaluated using both the UVevisible spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrophotometry in order to probe interaction of these compounds with DNA. The addition of CT-DNA (4e200 mM) to the buffered methanolic solution of 5b (30 mM) induced hyperchromic shift of 112% in absorption band at 255 nm whereas hypochromic shift of 37% in the characteristic quinoline ring absorption at 330 nm (Fig. 8) . Also, the bathochromic shift of w3 nm was observed for both the absorptions. The observed hyperchromic as well as hypochromic shifts in absorption bands of 5b upon addition of DNA results from the intercalation of 5b with CT DNA as suggested in the literature [42] . The intercalative nature of interaction of compound 5b with CT DNA was additionally supported by thermal denaturation experiment. Intercalation of molecules into the double helix is known to stabilize the DNA against thermal strand separation and thus increases thermal melting temperature (T m ) [43, 44] . The derivative melting curve presented in Fig. 9 shows an increase of 7.5 C in thermal melting temperature of CT DNA upon addition of 5b which is less than that observed for the CQ (Table S3) . Thus, both the UVevisible titrations and thermal denaturation experiment advocate partial intercalative nature of interactions between compound 5b and CT DNA.",

Comparison of binding constant of 5b with CT DNA (log K 5.76) and pUC18 DNA (log K 5.73) calculated from titration data using HypSpec [39] , suggest that 5b does not discriminate between GC rich DNA and AT rich DNA.",

For monitoring the progress of a reaction and for comparison purpose, thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on pre-coated aluminum sheets of Merck (60F 254 , 0.2 mm) using an appropriate solvent system. The chromatograms were visualized under UV light. For column chromatography silica gel (60e120 mesh) was employed and eluents were ethyl acetate/ hexane or ethyl acetate/methanol mixtures. The steady state fluorescence experiments were carried out on Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer at ambient temperature. UVevisible spectral studies were conducted on Shimadzu 1601 PC spectrophotometer with a quartz cuvette (path length, 1 cm). The absorption spectra have been recorded between 1100 and 200 nm.
