            "text": "The 'damage-response' framework of microbial pathogenesis is based on three tenets 1,2 (BOX 1). First, that microbial pathogenesis is the outcome of an interaction between a HOST and a microorganism, and is attributable to neither the microorganism nor the host alone. Second, that the pathological outcome of the hostmicroorganism interaction is determined by the amount of DAMAGE to the host. Third, that damage to the host can result from microbial factors and/or the host response. These tenets form a scaffold -or framework -on which a formal theory can be built and tested. (Glossary terms within this article are defined as applied in the damage-response framework 1-6 .) It is likely that relationships have existed between hosts and microorganisms for as long as there have been interactions between host and microbial cells. Indeed, ancient host-microorganism interactions, in which bacteria were incorporated into a primordial host as organelles, are likely to have resulted in the evolution of eukaryotes 7, 8 . The outcome of many hostmicroorganism interactions can be either beneficial or detrimental to the microorganism, to the host, or to both the microorganism and the host (TABLE 1) . MUTUALISM and COMMENSALISM are examples of interactions that are beneficial to both the host and the microorganism. In the case of microorganisms that replicate within their hosts, detrimental outcomes result in the inability to replicate further and/or death. Although microbial replication can cause host damage, and possibly DISEASE, host damage and/or disease are not essential for microbial survival. Furthermore, microbial viability is not a requirement for microbial pathogenesis. For example, cysticercosis -a devastating neurological disease that is caused by the host inflammatory response to the cestode Taenia solium -can be precipitated by the death of the parasite, such that anti-helminthic therapy is considered to be detrimental in certain clinical situations 9 .",

The emergence of these diseases shows that the existing concepts of pathogenicity and virulence do not take into account the fact that both the microorganism and the host contribute to microbial pathogenesis. To address this impediment to studies of host-microorganism interactions, we propose a new theoretical approach to understanding microbial pathogenesis, known as the 'damage-response' framework. HOST An entity in which microorganisms reside and/or replicate; an entity in which microbial pathogenesis occurs. DAMAGE Disruptions in the normal homeostatic mechanisms of a host that alter the functioning of cells, tissues or organs; for microorganisms, disruptions in the normal mechanisms that enable host entry, replication and/or the ability to establish residence in a host. infectious diseases that are caused by microorganisms that have been referred to as 'weak' , 'non'-pathogens or those that are 'less virulent'. Similarly, the concept of microbial 'opportunism' was devised to explain the emergence of previously rare infectious diseases in individuals with impaired immunity 15, 16 . However, the classification of such microorganisms as 'opportunistic' was often inadequate and misleading, as some so-called 'opportunistic' microorganisms can also cause disease in normal hosts 15 . Host failure, which is a 'host-centred' view of microbial pathogenesis, has also been used to explain the occurrence of diseases that are caused by microorganisms that do not fit Koch's postulates because they lack virulence determinants. These microorganisms do not cause disease in all hosts 17 and so cannot be explained by 'microorganism-centred' views. Examples of such diseases are catheter-associated candidiasis, Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.",

The capacity of a defined characteristic, or mutation, to confer virulence in a host is required to fulfil molecular Koch's postulates 14 . By contrast, the approach of 'hostcentred' investigators, such as immunologists, generally involves manipulation of the host as the microbial variables are held constant. This is exemplified by studies that attempt to establish that a host component is essential for host defence by comparing the outcome of infection with the relevant microorganism in both normal (wild-type) and deficient (knockout) mice. Notably, the field of vaccinology has elements of both views, as evidenced by 'microorganism-centred' approaches with 'host-centred' thinking -a distinction that can place it at odds with its parental discipline of immunology 18 .",

Classifications based on the perceived capacity of a microorganism to cause disease are also inadequate, because changes in host immune function, ecology and/or behaviour can render them obsolete. For example, Candida spp. were considered essentially non-pathogenic until the mid-1950s, when the introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy and corticosteroids resulted in the recognition that they could cause disease in certain hosts 20 . Similarly, immunization can render a pathogenic microorganism a 'nonpathogen', as host immunity abrogates the ability of the relevant microorganism to cause disease. For example, variola virus is not pathogenic in individuals immunized with vaccinia virus. The central tenets of the 'damage-response' framework -that the outcome of microbial pathogenesis is the result of a host-microorganism interaction, and that the relevant outcome of this interaction is host damage -provide the basis for a new pathogen-classification scheme. This scheme is based on damage-response curves, which depict the host-microorganism interaction (FIG. 1 ). It consists of six different parabolic curves that represent the amount of host damage as a function of the intensity and degree of the host response. Each type of curve represents a type or a 'class' of pathogen (FIG. 2) . In the absence of a host response, damage is the result of the ability of the microorganism to induce damage. However, it is likely that most, if not all, hosts generate some degree of response to microbial infection and that many mechanisms that produce this response have the capacity to induce host damage.",

In the past, the meaning of the word 'virulence' has also caused confusion 1 . The damageresponse framework defines virulence as the relative capacity of a microorganism to cause damage to a host 1 . The word 'relative' is included because virulence is frequently measured in comparison with another microorganism or a variant of the same microorganism. However, when a more complete understanding of quantitative measures of damage is available, it should be possible to dispense with the word 'relative'.

These classifications are confusing, because, in addition to being problematic and often inadequate, they are also overlapping. Phylogenetic groupings are not very useful for pathogen classification because most of the members of any group are not pathogenic in a host.

For example, based on the available information, the new coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 21 could be classified as a Class 3-, 4-, 5-or 6-like pathogen, depending on the information that is obtained from subsequent studies. Pathogens in these classes all cause host damage in the setting of strong immune responses, and SARS has been associated with lung damage in the setting of apparently robust immune responses. Indeed, the proposed system is flexible and allows pathogenic microorganisms to be regrouped as new information becomes available. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers' yeast) was considered to be non-pathogenic until it was associated with disease in certain patients with severe immune impairment 22 , which would have led it to be categorized as a Class 1 pathogen. However, recent evidence indicates that certain mutations in S. cerevisiae increase its virulence in normal mice by altering its surface properties to elicit a potent pro-inflammatory response that damages tissues and causes disease 23 . Consequently, it might be more appropriate to characterize S. cerevisiae as a Class 2 or 3 pathogen in mice.",

These states are a consequence of the outcome of the amount of host damage that results from hostmicroorganism interactions over time, and are generally continuous, such that when damage exceeds a threshold amount, another state becomes relevant 5 . For example, the state of colonization becomes the state of disease when a critical amount of host damage has occurred; the state of disease can become the state of latency; and the state of latency can become the state of disease, again depending on the amount of damage resulting from the host-microorganism interaction. These definitions make no assumptions about the length of time that a state predominates, but instead indicate that as time progresses, different outcomes of infection are determined by the nature and degree of damage that results from the host-microorganism interaction. The role of the host response in the outcome of microbial infection is twofold. First, it defines the threshold that distinguishes host damage from clinical disease, and second, it represents a factor that mediates transitions between the different states. At present, the inability to precisely define both damage and the threshold between damage and disease, makes the distinction between certain states difficult. For example, distinguishing commensalism from colonization is not possible when the latter is accompanied by little or no damage 2, 5 .",

Previously, we have proposed that toxin-producing microorganisms are a variant of Class 3 where the curve is flat at both ends 1 , but here we suggest that this type of interaction might be unique and warrants a separate panel. As shown here, the damage-response classification scheme is flexible and makes it possible to postulate the existence of pathogens for which there are no known examples at present. Such pathogens could be recognized in the future as 'emerging' pathogens as shown in c and d. c | The Class 4 curve is extended below the x-axis.

One example of such a phenomenon would be an antibody response to a hypothetical microorganism, whereby host damage is caused by antigen-antibody complexes. Although we cannot think of a specific microorganism that fits this description at this time, examples of this type of host damage are the host-microorganism interactions characterized by the Herxheimer reaction following treatment of syphilis, the similar reaction that can occur after the initiation of therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and serum sickness following the injection of foreign protein.",

However, clinical experience has shown improved outcomes in patients that are treated with corticosteroids, which indicates that lung damage in AIDS patients with P. carinii pneumonia is mediated largely by the residual immune system. Therefore, P. carinii pneumonia occurs in individuals with impaired ('weak') immune responses, but damage is likely to be immune-mediated.

Similarly, measures of damage, such as fever, organ dysfunction and cytokine levels in serum, are too insensitive to provide an accurate measure of the amount and quality of damage that results from the host-microorganism interaction. Damage, like the immune response, is the result of multiple events and their contributions from cellular, tissue and organ toxicity.
