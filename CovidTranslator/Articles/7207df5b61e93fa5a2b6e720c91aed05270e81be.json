Low extraction efficiency might give poor signals during exponential amplification and thus result in false negative results. [11] [12] Low extraction quality, on the other hand, may contain a variety of PCR inhibitors, which gives unreliable readouts during amplification. [13] [14] In the control and diagnosis towards SARS-CoV-2 currently, silica-based spin column RNA extraction methods are widely used, in which a silica membrane or glass fiber is applied to bind nucleic acids. In these traditional methods, the samples need pre-lysis in an appropriate buffer to release nucleic acids from viral particles before binding to the column membrane and multiple centrifugation steps are required to enable binding, washing and elution of extracted nucleic acids. Additionally, as various corrosive chaotropic salts and toxic organic solvents are involved in the lysis and binding steps, several sequential washing steps are required to eliminate possible PCR inhibitory effects in the eluted products. The whole process comprises multiple centrifuging and column-transferring steps, which is laborious, time-consuming, and vulnerable to contamination or column clogging. More importantly, spin column-based approaches are not suitable for a high-throughput, automated operation. In the monitoring and control of sudden outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, these traditional methods consume a large number of operators, but giving low diagnosis efficiency and high risk of cross infection. Thus, fast, convenient and automated nucleic acids extraction methods are highly desirable not just in the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, but also in the monitoring and prevention of other infectious diseases.",

[15] [16] [17] In conventional MNPs-based methods, nucleic acids in the lysed samples can be specifically absorbed on MNPs due to various surfacemodified functional groups. In the presence of magnetic fields, nucleic acids are rapidly separated from most impurities in the supernatant. After fast washing steps to eliminate trace impurities, purified nucleic acids can be further released from the surface of MNPs by elution buffer with altered ionic strength. Although much simpler and faster than spin column-based methods, most MNPs-based extraction strategies still contain multiple processing steps such as lysis, binding, washing and elution, which increases operational difficulties in real clinical diagnosis.",

The MNPs is synthesized via a simple one-pot approach, and functionalized with polymers carrying multi-carboxyl groups by following one-step incubation. Due to the strong interaction between carboxyl groups and nucleic acids, the poly carboxyl-functionalized MNPs (pcMNPs) enables rapid and efficient absorption of RNA molecules. In RNA extraction, one lysis/binding step and one washing step are required for nucleic acids extraction and purification from complex samples. More importantly, extracted RNA can be directed introduced into subsequent RT-PCR together with MB without elution step, which dramatically reduce operating time and risk of contamination. The fast extraction method was verified by both manual operation and automated system. Due to its simplicity, satisfactory performances and robustness, this method provides a promising alternative to decrease the labour-intensity and reduce possibility of false-negative results in current RT-PCRbased SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.",

Because no centrifugation steps are required, MNPs-based methods allow fully automated nucleic acid purification, which is highly important in current SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Therefore, the feasibility of automating viral RNA extraction procedure based on our pcMNPs was subsequently evaluated. A commercialized magnetic rods-based nucleic acid purification system was used. An automated programme was set according to the manual protocol (Figure4A). During the extraction process, although the shaking pattern of magnetic rods was set at the most vigorous level, no breakage or leakage of pcMNPs were observed, since the eluted solution are colourless and transparent (FigureS4). As shown in Figure4B, the amplification curve of the automated sample is very close to that of the positive control and manually performed Direct RT-PCR samples, which suggests that our pcMNPs-based method is highly suitable for the automated high throughput viral RNA extraction. author/funder.

Meanwhile, the differences of Ct values between neighbouring curves are approximately 3 cycles, which is very close to the theoretical 3.3 cycles for a 10-fold dilution. These results indicated that the RT-PCR amplification is highly efficient both in the presence or absence of pcMNPs. However, it is also important to note that in both cases, the negative controls sometimes gave observable amplification signals. Although their Ct values are lagged too far behind 40 cycles to be regarded as a valid positive result, this phenomenon raise concerns about possible false-positive issues, in which further optimization of primer pairs and probe might be necessary.",

Both iron solutions were then mixed in a 500 mL round-bottom flask, and 10 mL of ammonium hydroxide was added into the mixture with vigorous stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere. A rapid change of solution colour was observed from orange to black, indicating the formation of co-precipitated bare MNPs. The solution mixture was continuously stirred for another 4 h, and the resulting black products (bare MNPs) were collected with a magnet and dispersed into ethanol after washing several times with deionized water and ethanol. Subsequently, 0.3 g of as-prepared bare MNPs, 15 mL of deionized water and 12 mL of ammonium hydroxide were added into 150 mL of ethanol, followed by a continuous sonication for 30 min at room temperature. 1.2 mL of TEOS was then added dropwise into the solution mixture after sonication, and vigorously stirred for another 4 h at room temperature to allow the formation of silica layers on the surface of MNPs.

To investigate the morphology of prepared pcMNPs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used and the representative image was shown in Figure1A, suggesting a spherical morphology of the prepared pcMNPs. In addition, enlarged TEM image of pcMNPs revealed a thin silica-layer on the particle surfaces with a thickness around 3 nm, implied the successful preparation of silica-coating. By using the dynamic light scattering technique, it is observed that the prepared pcMNPs have an average diameter of 10.22 \u00b1 2.8 nm without apparent aggregation (Figure1B). To verify the successful functionalization of synthesized PC polymers, the average zeta potentials of bare MNPs, silica-coated MNPs and pcMNPs were measured by DLS. As shown in Fig 1C, the average zeta potential changed from -4.82 mV \u00b1 0.54 of bare MNPs to 20.57 mV \u00b1 0.71 of silica-coated MNPs due to the NH2-groups introduced during silica-coating. However, functionalization of PC polymers resulted in a decrease of average zeta potential of pcMNPs to -38.67 mV \u00b1 0.84, indicating successful polymer coating and more importantly, good dispersion of pcMNPs in the solution.
