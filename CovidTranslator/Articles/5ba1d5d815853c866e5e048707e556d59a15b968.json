The accumulated data collected in a standard and consistent way will allow rapid assessment for each influenza season and future pandemics within and among countries. 2 The 2009 pandemic and seasonal influenza epidemics demonstrated the importance of having an established real-time respiratory disease surveillance Implementing hospital-based surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections caused by infl uenza and other respiratory pathogens in New Zealand system in the southern hemisphere to inform the northern hemisphere countries about newly emerging pandemic or seasonal influenza. 3,4 A surveillance system can provide critical data on the epidemiology, burden, impact, circulating influenza, other respiratory pathogens and effectiveness of influenza prevention and control measures at a time when similar data in the northern hemisphere are not available.",
