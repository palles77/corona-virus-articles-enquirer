To identify novel small molecules that target Nipah virus replication as potential therapeutics, Southern Research Institute and Galveston National Laboratory jointly developed an automated high-throughput screening platform that is capable of testing 10,000 compounds per day within BSL-4 biocontainment. Using this platform, we screened a 10,080-compound library using a cell-based, high-throughput screen for compounds that inhibited the virus-induced cytopathic effect. From this pilot effort, 23 compounds were identified with EC 50 values ranging from 3.9 to 20.0 lM and selectivities >10. Three sulfonamide compounds with EC 50 values <12 lM were further characterized for their point of intervention in the viral replication cycle and for broad antiviral efficacy. Development of HTS capability under BSL-4 containment changes the paradigm for drug discovery for highly pathogenic agents because this platform can be readily modified to identify prophylactic and postexposure therapeutic candidates against other BSL-4 pathogens, particularly Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses.",

            "text": "N ipah virus (NiV) is a member of the genus Henipavirus (family of Paramyxoviridae) that causes severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans. The first human cases of NiV were identified during an outbreak of severe febrile encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998-1999. 1 During the outbreak, 276 patients with encephalitis were reported, with 106 fatalities (38%). The primary mode of transmission to humans was believed to be pig-to-human because this outbreak involved occupational exposure to pigs. 2, 3 Additional outbreaks of NiV have occurred in Bangladesh and India almost annually, [4] [5] [6] and most recently in Bangladesh in 2013. These outbreaks were associated with a significantly higher case fatality rate of 67% to 92%. In addition, a higher prevalence of respiratory disease was observed during these outbreaks. 6 Person-to-person contact with a patient carried the highest risk of transmission. 7 Given the lack of effective therapeutics and vaccines, these viruses are considered as public health concerns and listed as category C priority pathogens for biodefense research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In addition, NiV is considered an ''overlap'' select agent and regulated by both Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. Drug discovery for NiV has been hampered by the requirement to work with this virus at biosafety level 4 (BSL-4). One study 8 has used pseudotype assays as surrogates for drug discovery at BSL-2; however, this assay focused primarily on viral entry and is unlikely to identify compounds that inhibit other steps in the replication cycle. Until recently, the only highthroughput screening (HTS) assay that was available for wild-type NiV required fixation of plates with documented inactivation of live virus, removal of plates from the BSL-4, and subsequent immunodetection of virus replication at BSL-2. 9 Southern Research Institute and the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston National Laboratory (GNL) collaborated to established a BSL-4 HTS platform wherein Southern Research Institute provides HTS expertise, compound libraries, and bioinformatics support, and the GNL provides access to biocontainment laboratories, pathogens, and pathogen expertise. Southern Research Institute previously developed HTS platforms in BSL-2 and BSL-3 environments that are adaptable to a broad range of highly pathogenic viruses. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] These platforms were used to successfully identify compounds with antiviral activity as the first step in developing therapeutics. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Here we describe the extension of our previous BSL-2 and BSL-3 screening strategies to an HTS assay platform designed to screen up to 10,000 compounds per day at BSL-4 biocontainment. The platform was validated by the pilot screening of 10,000 compounds from the Enamine Diversity Library against NiV. Compounds found active in the primary screen were confirmed in concentration response testing using a cell toxicity assay, and were further characterized using viral titer reduction and time-of-addition assays. Three sulfonamide compounds were identified with NiV-specific antiviral activity and low cell toxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first instance in which an HTS platform was implemented in a BSL-4 environment.",

To measure viability of NiV-infected cells in cell culture, we employed the commercially available Viral ToxGlo Luminescent Cell Viability Kit. Determination of cell viability was based on quantification of ATP as an indicator of metabolically active cells. 13 The procedure involves adding the single reagent (a combination of detergent, luciferase, and substrate) directly to previously cultured cells in media, which lyses the cells and produces a bioluminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present, with the caveat that compounds that inhibit both luciferase and NiV replication will inherently give a negative signal.",

For the single dose pilot screen, 36 assay plates containing control wells and 280 compounds each (for a total of 10,080 compounds) were screened. Figure 1 shows the graphed characteristics of the screening results. The minimal hit criteria for the screen was defined as three times the standard deviation of the percent inhibition of all compound wells (11.0%). The very low statistical cut-off is indicative of an extremely robust assay. However, using 40% inhibition as our hit cutoff, we observed a 1.2% hit rate. Of the 10,080 compounds screened, 120 inhibited virus-induced CPE by 40% or greater (shaded gray in Fig. 1A) . The relative luminescence values from the median cell and virus controls that were used to calculate the percent cell viability (percent inhibition of CPE) and S/B are shown in Fig. 1B . As seen in the figure, the NiV antiviral primary assay has a broad signal window with low plate-to-plate standard deviations and excellent reproducibility. Z-factor values for each plate are shown in Fig 1C. Assays that produce Z values above 0.5 are considered suitable for HTS. 22 The Z-factor provides a quantitative means to measure the suitability of a particular assay for use in a large HTS and is defined by the mean values and standard deviations of both the positive and negative controls ( Figure 1B) . For our primary assay, the low standard deviations of the controls and the large signal window ( >30) contributed to a mean Z-factor of 0.74, which equates to a separation of 22 standard deviations between the means of the controls. This indicates that the assay is robust enough to expect predictability from a single-replicate screen. Lastly, because the primary screen was performed in two sets on different days, some slight variation in the median control values and Z-factors is observed between set 1 and set 2 ( Fig. 1B and 1C) ; notably, both control values were reduced proportionally. The reduction in absolute luminescence signal could have been caused by any number of factors but was most likely due to either slightly fewer cells in the wells of set 2 or a slightly lower ambient temperature when the endpoint reagent was read for set 2.",

Using this platform, we identified three sulfonamide compounds that can inhibit NiV-induced CPE and virus replication with EC 50 values < 12 mM and selectivities ranging from 12 to >40. Time-ofaddition experiments showed that all three compounds inhibit NiV infection when added up to 6 h postinfection, suggesting that each compound targets a later stage of virus replication, rather than the earlier entry stages. Since each compound performed with similar profiles, this also suggests that the inhibitory mechanism of each compound may be similar. A previous drug discovery search for NiV antivirals focused on the synthesis of novel fusion inhibitors derived from compounds that have been shown to be effective against other paramyxoviruses (i.e., measles virus). 24 The compounds from this study have demonstrated EC 50 values ranging from 1.5 to 8 mM, and SI values ranging from 3 to 13. However these values were based on the inhibition of function of individually expressed NiV G and F proteins; the compounds have not been tested using a virus infection assay. The sulfonamide compounds reported here demonstrate the same range of efficacy but a greater selectivity during a virus infection. Therefore, our BSL-4 HTS platform provides a reliable, rapid, and much needed means to screen small molecule libraries for broad efficacy against wild-type NiV replication.",

However, there are only limited reports of HTS assays in BSL-4 biocontainment. Traditional methods to monitor BSL-4 virus replication and the effects of antiviral compounds include either qualitative visual observation of CPE and the quantization of infectious virus particles using plaque assays, or the quantization of viral RNA transcripts by low-throughput real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. 25 None of these methods are amenable to HTS. To circumvent these challenges, many of the current HTS efforts using BSL-4 viruses, including Nipah and Ebola viruses, employ pseudotype, surrogate, or recombinantly attenuated pathogens that have been downgraded for use at lower biocontainment levels. 26, 27 However, a major drawback in the use of these artificial systems is that they may not accurately represent the response of fully virulent BSL-4 pathogens to the compounds, in terms of biological and biochemical characteristics. Furthermore, because not all stages of the virus replication cycle are represented in these systems, their utility is severely limited. Our assay addresses a number of the aforementioned problems. The assay was adapted and validated in a high biocontainment facility, making it possible to screen large compound libraries directly against wild-type viruses in BSL-4 environment. This capability of utilizing wild-type viruses instead of surrogates reduces the time required for effective drug development. Furthermore, this CPE-based HTS assay allows the evaluation of antiviral efficacy against the entire viral life cycle.",

            "text": "There are only a few reports of validated, HTS-adaptable assays that are specifically for NiV, and as a result, drug discovery for NiV has been hampered. Until recently, the only high HTS assay that was available for NiV required fixation of plates, removal of plates from the BSL-4, and subsequent immunodetection of virus replication at BSL-2. 8 Recently, efforts have been made to adapt immunoplaque assays in a microtiter plate format. These have utilized a two-step assay protocol involving an overnight virus inoculation of Vero cell monolayers at BSL-4, followed by cell fixation and virus inactivation. After the plates were decontaminated and transferred to a BSL-2 laboratory, an immunodetection assay was performed. 9 However, the number of manipulations and the safe and regulated transfer of mi-crotiter plates out of the BSL-4 make this method impractical for automation or HTS. Our antiviral HTS assay against NiV has a simple onestep protocol using flexible and stable luminescent signal generated by the amount of ATP, which positively correlates with cellular viability in the sample. Furthermore, a S/B value greater than 5 is considered as an adequate detection window, and a Z-value greater than 0.5 is considered robust enough for HTS assay. 22 The Z-value of our assay was 0.74 and S/B ratio was over 31, suggesting that it is robust enough to identify antiviral compounds in a single dose, single replicate HTS assay. However, while the hit rate is similar to other reported HTS antiviral assays, 13, 14, 23 the lower confirmation rate of this assay (45%) is due to the concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of the other hit compounds, which removed them from further consideration. Because the hit cytotoxicity is a characteristic of both the compounds in the Enamine Diversity set and the cell type used in the primary and confirmatory assays, this is not an inherent problem with the assay design.",

This platform allows us to screen wild-type virus strains instead of pseudotype, surrogate, or recombinantly attenuated viruses that have been downgraded for use at lower biocontainment levels. The throughput of the HTS assay is considerably greater than previous reports of HTS using BSL-4 pathogens and allows the screening of up to 10,000 compounds from small molecule libraries at a single dose, per day, and up to 1000 hit compounds for concentration-dependent dose response, per day. The dual threat of emerging pathogens that exhibit high mobidity and mortality and the possibility of these pathogens being used as a bioterorist weapons make the development of antiviral therapy an increasingly critical need. The development of HTS technology for BSL-4 addresses this by providing a crucial, needed tool for modern drug development against highly pathogenic viruses.",
