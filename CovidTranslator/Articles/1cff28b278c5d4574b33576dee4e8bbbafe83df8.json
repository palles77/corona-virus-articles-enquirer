In Shigella, IpaD gene is one of the key pathogenic genes causing strong mucosal immune system reactions. Anthrax disease is caused by Bacillus anthracis. PA protective antigen is one of the subunits in anthrax toxin complex responsible for the transfer of other subunits into the cytosol of host cells. The 20 kDa subunit of PA (PA20) has the property of immunogenicity. CTxB or B subunit of Vibrio cholerae toxin (CT) is a non-toxic protein and has the function to transfer toxic subunit into cytosol of the host cells by binding to GM1 receptor. The aim of this study was to fuse PA20, ipaD and CTxB and transform tomato plants by this cassette in order to produce an oral vaccine against shigellosis, anthrax and cholera. CTxB was used for these two antigens as an immune adjuvant. IpaD and PA20 genes were cloned in pBI121 containing the CTxB gene and Extensin signal peptide. In order to evaluate the transient expression of Shigellosis, Anthrax and Cholera antigens, agro-infiltrated tomato tissues were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens containing the gene cassette. Cloning was confirmed by PCR, enzymatic digestion and sequencing techniques. Expression of the antigens was examined by SDS-PAGE, dot blot and ELISA. Maturate green fruits demonstrated the highest expression of the recombinant proteins. The first phase of this study was carried out for cloning and expressing of CtxB, ipaD and PA20 antigens in tomato. In the next phase, we aim to analyze the immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate in laboratory animals.",

            "text": "Shigella is a genus from Escherichia order and the Enterobacteriaceae family that is a small, non-aerobic bacilli form, gram-negative, non-sedentary and non-sporulating bacterium. In terms of biochemical and serological properties Shigella is classified into four different categories including Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii and Shigella sonnei [1] . The main part of the mechanism of molecular pathogenesis of Shigella is the infection of host intestinal epithelial cells and intracellular survival in the epithelial environment. Pathogenesis controlling factors are coded by both plasmids and chromosomes of bacteria [2, 3] . Ipa operon contains ipA, B, C and D genes. The product of these genes are very important antigens, causing the host to show strong immune responses against Shigella. ipaD is a 37 kDa protein that recruits ipaB protein on the cell surface and triggers the invasion. This protein has been located on top of the third type of Shigella secretion system. Bacillus anthracic is a rod-shaped Gram-positive bacterium with sporulation power. It is sedentary and grows rapidly at 37 \u00b0C [4] . Anthrax three main symptoms include skin, respiratory and digestive systems that 95% of cases reported worldwide is skin symptoms [5] . About 80% of skin type of anthrax is not an important issue and will spontaneously improve within a few weeks [6] . While 10-20% of cases, if not going to the clinical treatment, will lead to death [7] .",

Edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF) enzymes are transported by the third unit called protective antigen protein (PA) to the cytosol of mammalian cells. EF is an adenylate cyclase causing Edema and impaired immune response to infection when combined with PA and injected to mammals [8, 9] . LF is a protease that cuts some of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases [10, 11] . Association of toxin subunits begins when the PA binds to a cellular receptor called receptor of anthrax toxin, a membrane protein with high expression. Then PA is cleaved into two fragments by a protease from the Furin proteases group. This enzyme removes the 20 kDa fragment of the N-terminal, while carboxyl end of the 63 kDa fragment remains attached to the cell receptors [12] . Unlike the native PA, the 63 kDa PA is oligomerized and comes in the form of a heptamer ring [13, 14] . While native PA remains on the cell surface the heptamer is transported into the cell with endocytosis [15] . Transferring non-toxic complexes to the low pH of endosomal vesicles causes 63 kDa heptamer to attach to the membrane to form a channel [16, 17] . EF and LF passing through the channel to reach the cytosol [18] .",

Transgenic plants are a good alternative to the animal cells and prokaryotic expression systems. Transgenic plants are produced with different purposes, such as to obtain higher yield, improved quality and resistance to pests and diseases. Therefore, similarly transgenic plants can be created to express synthetic and medicinal proteins including monoclonal antibodies, antigens, vaccines, therapeutic enzymes, blood proteins, cytokines, growth factors and hormones [21] . The most important advantage of using transgenic plants is healthy aspect of their products. Transgenic plants are not host to human pathogens. Thus human pathogens such as contaminated products to hepatitis, HIV, carcinogens and bacterial toxins, etc. will not exist in transgenic plants [22] . Peptide antigens that are expressed in the edible and delicious parts of plants have led to the idea of the synthesis of active edible vaccines [23] .",

Kanamycin and rifampin were used to select colonies harboring recombinant plasmid and Agrobacterium (and not other possible bacteria contamination like transformed E. coli), respectively. A colony of Agrobacterium was first cultured in the LB medium containing 200 \u00b5M acetocyringone and 50 mg/l kanamycin overnight and the bacteria was pelleted at 3500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Pelleted bacteria were then resuspended in a 100 ml inoculation buffer and remained on the desk for 3-4 h. To evaluate the transient expression of the genes, agro-infiltration was carried out on the two-month-old tomato plant leaves, maturate green and completely red state fruits, grown in the green house. Leaves and fruits were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens via agro-injection method. In this assay inoculation medium containing 10 mM MgSo4, 10 mM MES and 200 \u00b5M acetosyringone (pH adjusted to 5.6) used for injection of Agrobacterium with a syringe. The Agrobacterium solution was injected smoothly with a needleless syringe to leaf and with a needle containing syringe to fruit pericarp tissues. Fortunately, in the injection area, Agrobacterium solution movement inside the leaf and fruit tissue was clearly seen. We tried to inject the parts (about 2 cm in diameter) of the leaf and fruit with Agrobacterium completely until saturated level, that we could not inject anymore. Finally, the areas where the solution completely injected, was carefully marked. For protein extraction assay, the places where Agrobacterium was injected and marked was precisely and carefully sampled to eliminate the non-Agrobacterium injected parts. The inoculated samples were kept in a growth chamber at 26 \u00b0C in a 16/8 h dark and light condition for 5-7 days.",

Figure 3b lane 1 shows the result of digestion of the new engineered plasmid (pBI_Ex-CTxB-PA20-ipaD) with BamHI and the presence of 535 bp fragment (PA20). Since the cloning was carried out with the single digestion, checking the orientation of insertion was necessary. Therefore, plasmids were digested with HindIII. There are two HindIII restriction sites, one in PA20 and the other in the plasmid backbone. The digestion of the recombinant plasmid led to the appearance of a 1800 bp fragment and the linearized plasmid on the agarose gel. This digestion procedure shows that the fragment had inserted into the plasmid in a correct orientation (Fig. 3b lane 2) .

RTB specially delivers the ipaD to the mucosal associated lymph tissues (MALTs). The B subunit of cholera toxin or CTxB is a pentameric, non-toxic unit of cholera toxin responsible for binding of CT to its receptor, GM1. Studies revealed that the CTxA1 subunit of CT is responsible for CT toxicity. Binding of CT to CTxB subunit makes a route that CTxA1 can move via translocation through the central channel of CTxB in the clatrin and caveolin coated vesicles to the cytosol of host cells. Most of the mammalian cells, like red blood cells and leucocytes expresses the GM1 receptor on their surface [20] . It has been shown that the CTxB acts as an adjuvant for immune system and genetically fusing this protein to an antigen improves the immune response of the host to that antigen [20, 31] . Therefore, CTxB can deliver the antigens to MALTs and facilitate its uptake by APC (antigen presenting cells). The second role for CTxB is that it can immunize the host to Vibrio cholerae. The anthrax toxin produced by Bacillus anthracic has three subunits that are not toxic to the host cells.",

            "text": "Protective antigen (PA) translocate Edema and lethal factors to host cell cytosol [8, 9] . PA is cleaved into two parts, including PA20, by the cell surface proteases. After this cleavage, PA20 releases into the plasma and it seems not to have any roles in disease pathogenesis or bacterial virulence. However, this protein has a diagnostic value for anthrax and can be used to induce immunity against Bacillus anthracis [32] . PA20 immunogenicity was confirmed through multiple studies in-vivo in laboratory animals [33] [34] [35] . Reason et al. showed that more than 62% of antibodies against PA antigen were specific for a-1 domain of PA or PA20 fragment and this suggest the potential of this fragment to develop as a vaccine candidate [36] even in treatment of cancer due to its capability to induce apoptosis in host cells [37] We expressed these three mentioned antigens in tomato to achieve an edible vaccine. Various studies in this field have been carried out. Demurtas et al. expressed two corona virus antigens responsible for pandemic sever acute respiratory syndrome or SARS in tobacco [38] . Chowdhury and Bagasra presented a theory that could express different life cycle antigens of malaria parasite (about 12 antigens) in tomato plant. They introduced tomato as a healthy and natural friendly plant. The suitability of the use of plants for expressing antigens and the production of edible vaccines by plant expression systems shows a bright future [39] . The first studies that were conducted on potato and tobacco and now other plants such as tomato, banana and lettuce have been put into research on the edible vaccines. Due to the short lifetime for consumption, these plants have a considerable disadvantage. The way suggested is not so complicated; drying and powdering the fresh fruits or plant tissues. In this regard, the tomato fruits expressing a particular antigen could be kept for 1 year without any decrease in the activity of the antigen [40] . Nowadays, bioinformatics analysis of proteins and antigens became an integrated steps in proteins and antigens identification [41] . Prior to experimental approaches, in a study using bioinformatics tools, we also, determined the most stable chimeric form of these three antigens (ipaD, PA20 and CTxB) in different eukaryotes and prokaryotes cells [42] . In the experimental phase of our study, in the first step, a 321 bp fragment of ipaD was inserted into plant expression binary plasmid. The second fragment (PA20) was inserted into the plasmid between ipaD and CTxB. Reverse primer of PA20 included a sequence of 12 nucleotides (proline and glycine) as a linker that was added to the C-terminal of PA20 through PCR amplification. Various investigations have used the proline-glycine linker to form a separator between two fused proteins. This sequence (linker) could be identified as the site of cleavage by the cell surface proteases like furin proteases. Delivering the fused antigens to the host cell surface by CTxB protein, makes the linker accessible to the cell surface proteases. Cleavage of this site by the proteases leads to the separation of PA20 and ipaD antigens. After the cloning procedures, we confirmed the correct sequence of recombinant plasmid by sequencing. We expressed the recombinant protein in tomato different tissues through an agro-infiltration assay. Based on the ELISA results, the expression of recombinant proteins in green fruits was 4 times higher than leaves and red fruits. Two assumptions can be made for this result. First, obviously, tomato fruits are more suitable than leaves for agroinjection by syringe, i.e. greater amounts of Agrobacterium can be injected into its pericarp tissues than leaves. Secondly, green tomato pericarp tissue is likely to be very active in protein biosynthesis. This is due to the fast growth of fruit in the green stage. In the end of fruit biomass production of tomato, development of fruit stops and ripening begins. At the ripening state protein metabolism decreases in fruits. However, our results showed that tomato fruit is a suitable choice for the expression of recombinant proteins. Since the maximum expression of antigens was observed in the green tomato fruits. The noteworthy point is that tomato fruit is consumed in a ripe and red state. the production of recombinant proteins in green fruit or leaves will not be so useful. However, it should be noted that in our gene construct a general CaMV35S promoter was used. Thus, as a suggestion for the specific expression of these proteins, a tomato fruitspecific promoter involved in ethylene biosynthesis can be used, so that these genes are activated and expressed at the time of fruit ripening.",
