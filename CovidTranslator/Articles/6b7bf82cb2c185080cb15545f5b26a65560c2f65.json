Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.",

The earliest medical literature identifies individuals who are chronically fatigued but have no other identifiable medical or psychiatric illness that would account for these symptoms, and these individuals have been described by many different labels over the millennia. In 1869, Beard first coined the term neurasthenia to describe a condition that occurred from depletion of the central nervous system's energy reserves, which Beard attributed to the consequences of aspects of modern civilization. Physicians in the Beard school of thought associated neurasthenia with the stresses of urbanization and the stress experienced a result of an increasingly competitive business environment. Typically, the condition was associated with members of the upper class or professionals with sedentary employment. The term neurasthenia has largely been abandoned, and no evidence suggests that this disorder was one of urbanization.",

These patients, typically affected by severe postinfectious fatigue, may also experience multifocal pain (including in regions such as the muscles, throat, and neck, which are painful during many acute infections), sleep disturbances, memory difficulties, and many other somatic symptoms.",

The patients in this study were extensively evaluated by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and several academic groups, and they were found to have immunological abnormalities as well as evidence of elevated antibodies to a number of different viral pathogens, leading to the theory that there was an active viral illness that was causing these symptoms. However, after extensive subsequent investigations of this group of patients, as well as many other clusters of patients initially identified as part of an \"epidemic\" of fatiguing illness, it became increasingly clear that neither this symptom complex nor any immunological abnormalities identified were specific to any single epidemic, or single pathogen [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

Five of the eight symptoms required in addition to fatigue are pain-based symptoms (sore throat, tender glands, aching or stiff muscles, multijoint pain, new headaches); therefore, it is virtually impossible for a patient to meet CDC CFS criteria without having pain in at least one body region. In fact, most patients with CFS have prominent pain in multiple anatomical regions, especially if they are queried about chronic pain over the course of their lifetime. In fact, an absence of a history of multiple sites of pain may differentiate this particular subset of CFS patients from the subset that clearly overlaps with FM, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and chronic headache patients, for example. FM, IBS, chronic headaches, and other related syndromes have an interesting history as well. The terms used to describe and label patients with these syndromes are also largely historical and at least initially were viewed through the perspective of the specialist that sees patients with symptoms in a particular region of the body or of underlying pathogenesis (eg, infectious disease, endocrinology). Thus, an infectious disease expert may see a patient and focus on the infectious nature of his or her symptoms, rule out active infection, and use the label CFS. A physiatrist seeing the same patient may focus on the few most severe regions of pain and diagnose myofascial pain, whereas a rheumatologist instead notes that the pain is more widespread and not accompanied by inflammation and diagnoses FM. Historically, subspecialists have used the descriptive terms most familiar to them given their training and patient populations most commonly treated.",

Spastic colitis similarly became IBS, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome became temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD), and interstitial cystitis is well on its way to be renamed painful bladder syndrome, all because of the recognition that central factors rather than peripheral damage or inflammation appear to be driving the pain. Even psychiatrists got into the misnaming game.

This diagram helped stimulate research to search for etiological connections among these syndromes [32, 33] . Hudson and colleagues [34] [35] [36] demonstrated that conditions such as CFS, FM, IBS, and other pain/fatigue syndromes coaggregated in patients and in families.

The gender difference appears more apparent in clinical samples (especially tertiary care), however, than in populationbased samples [37, 38] . \u2022 There is a strong familial predisposition to these symptoms and illnesses, and studies clearly show that these somatic symptoms and syndromes are separable from depression and other psychiatric disorders [39] [40] [41] . \u2022 A variety of biological stressors appear to be capable of either triggering or exacerbating these symptoms and illnesses, including physical trauma, infections, early life trauma, and deployment to war, in addition to some other types of psychological stressors (eg, there was no increase in somatic symptoms or worsening of FM after the terrorist attacks of 9/11) [42, 43] . \u2022 Groups of patients with these conditions (eg, FM, IBS, chronic headache, TMJD, CFS) display diffuse hyperalgesia (increased pain in response to normally painful stimuli) and/or allodynia (pain in response to normally nonpainful stimuli). Many patients with these conditions also have been shown to demonstrate more sensitivity to many stimuli other than pain (ie, auditory, visual), and data suggest that these patients have a fundamental problem with pain or sensory processing rather than an abnormality confined to the specific body region in which the pain is being experienced. In fact, the expanded relevance of the FM construct relates to the idea that all patients (with and without pain) have different \"volume control\" settings on their pain and sensory processing. The position on this bell-shaped curve of pain or sensory sensitivity largely determines whether they will have pain or other sensory symptoms during the course of their lifetime and how severe these symptoms will be. \u2022 In addition to pain and sensory amplification, other shared underlying mechanisms that have been identified in these illnesses include: (1) neurogenic inflammation, especially of mucosal surfaces, leading to increased mast cells and the appearance of a mild inflammatory process in the periphery; (2) autonomic nervous system dysfunction; and (3) hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction. \u2022 Similar types of therapies are efficacious for all of these conditions, including both pharmacological (eg, tricyclic compounds such as amitriptyline) and nonpharmacological treatments (eg, exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]). Conversely, patients with these conditions typically do not respond to therapies that are effective when pain is attributable to damage or inflammation of tissues (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, opioids, injections, surgical procedures).",

Several reports document that CFS typically occurs in patients who had high premorbid levels of activity, and, in fact, high premorbid levels of activity and a lower body mass in young adulthood were the strongest predictors of CFS later in life [27, 65] . Patients often report excellent preillness physical fitness and energy and an abrupt onset of fatigue. After the onset of illness, patients indicate that physical exertion tends to exacerbate the fatigue. Glass et al [66] demonstrated that within a group of healthy, young subjects, the ones who developed multiple somatic symptoms after experimental exercise cessation were those that had autonomic and immune profiles resembling those of CFS patients. Recent studies performed by our group further examined the additive and synergistic roles that sleep restriction and exercise cessation have on the development of somatic symptoms in healthy patients and demonstrated that regular exercise seems to buffer some of the adverse effects of sleep on symptom development. Female patients were much more likely to have somatic symptoms when deprived of either sleep or exercise.",

None of the psychiatric measurements assessed in this study, which included the presence of a premorbid or intercurrent psychiatric disorder, the neuroticism score, and the locus of control score, was significantly predictive of the development of chronic symptoms. As with the studies of emotional stress triggering pain in the population, although distress per se did not predict the chronicity of symptoms after infection, the presence and severity of somatic symptoms (ie, the degree of \"somatization\") during the acute infection was closely correlated with the subsequent development of chronic fatigue (and pain).",

For example, in a meta-analysis summarizing the results of 8 different studies, Halvorson et al [78] noted that approximately 10% of patients developed postinfectious IBS after an episode of acute infectious gastroenteritis, regardless of the viral or bacterial pathogen that caused the acute illness. Similarly, an episode of acute urinary tract infection is evident in a proportion of women who develop interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome. In fact, in a recent study, Hamilton and associates [79] , who were among the first to investigate this issue across syndromes, found that episodes of gastroenteritis in diagnosed in primary care were risk factors for IBS, whereas viral infections increased the risk for subsequent development of CFS. They again found that premorbid psychiatric disorders such as depression only modestly increased the risk of this occurring.",

There are often accompanying somatic symptoms such as fatigue, memory, and mood difficulties. The risk of this symptom complex occurring with various infections is consistently found to be approximately 5% to 10%. The reason for this consistency is not clear. Evidently, the inciting infection must be of sufficient severity and duration because the increase in occurrence of chronic symptoms is not observed after common viral infections of short duration. This lack of specificity regarding the triggering effect of infection may well be associated with an underlying genetic predisposition, activated in a similar manner by various pathogens, and/or in patients with a set of \"maladaptive\" behavioral responses that could lead to symptoms, such as cessation of routine exercise or sleep.",

These studies showed that: (1) the random measures of pressure pain threshold were not influenced by levels of distress of the individual, whereas tender point count and dolorimetry examinations were; (2) patients with FM were much more sensitive to pressure even when these more sophisticated paradigms were used; (3) patients with FM were not any more \"expectant\" or \"hypervigilant\" than control patients; and (4) pressure pain thresholds at any 4 points in the body are highly correlated with the average tenderness at all 18 tender points and 4 \"control points\" (the thumbnail and forehead).",

The only neurotransmitter system that has been studied to date and not found to be out of line in a direction that would cause augmented pain transmission is the endogenous opioid system.

These systems are mediated primarily by the activity of the corticotropinreleasing hormone nervous system located in the hypothalamus and locus-ceruleus-norepinephrine/autonomic nervous system in the brain stem. Recent research suggests that although this system in humans has been highly adaptive throughout history, the stress response may be inappropriately triggered by a wide assortment of everyday occurrences that do not pose a real threat to survival, thus initiating the cascade of physiologic responses more frequently than can be tolerated [117] . The type of stress and the environment in which it occurs also have an impact on how the stress response is expressed. It has been noted that victims of accidents experience a greater frequency of FM and myofascial pain than those who cause them, which is congruent with animal studies showing that that the strongest physiological responses are triggered by events that are accompanied by a lack of control or support and thus viewed as perceived as inescapable or unavoidable [118] . In humans, daily \"hassles\" and personally relevant stressors seem to be more capable of causing symptoms than major catastrophic events that do not personally impact the individual.",

Female gender, worry or expectation of chronicity, lack of control of the stressor, intensity of the initial symptoms, and inactivity or time off work after the stressor make it more likely to trigger the development of pain, fatigue, or other somatic symptoms [119] . Naturally occurring catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, or fires are much less likely to lead to chronic somatic symptoms than similarly stressful events that are \"human-made,\" such as chemical spills, or war [120] . Being exposed to a multitude of stressors simultaneously, or during a period of time, may also be a significant risk for later somatic symptoms and or psychological sequelae. Intensely stressful events can lead to permanent changes in the activity of both mouse and human stress response systems [117, 121] . This link between exposure to \"stressors\" and the subsequent development of CFS and FM led to studies of human stress systems in this condition. These studies have generally shown alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system in CFS and related conditions [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] . Although these studies often note either hypo-or hyperactivity of both the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system in patients with FM and related conditions, the precise abnormality varies from study to study. Moreover, these studies only find \"abnormal\" HPA or autonomic function in a very small percentage of patients, and there is tremendous overlap between patients and control patients in these studies.",

However, when patients with FM and CFS have a favorable clinical response to these medications (generally noted in approximately one-third of patients) there is typically a global improvement in all symptoms, including fatigue as well as pain [154] [155] [156] . This observation would support the notion that similar neurotransmitter disturbances can lead to many somatic symptoms, including both pain and fatigue. Figure 4 lists the classes of drugs and their level of evidence in FM. Those drugs with the greatest level of efficacy in FM are also being shown to work in subsets of patients with CSS. More importantly, drugs such as duloxetine are being shown to be effective in conditions such as osteoarthritis and low back pain, demonstrating the these central mechanisms that are \"front and center\" in patients with syndromes such as FM may be also playing prominent roles in conditions heretofore thought to be peripheral pain syndromes.

Thus, clinicians will need different treatments for different patients. Going back to the \"essential hypertension of pain processing pathway\" analogy, just as we use 8 to 10 classes of drugs acting in different body systems and at different molecular targets to control hypertension, and patients may respond very well to one class of antihypertensive drug but not another, the same is true of CSS syndromes. Patients may only respond to one of these classes of drugs or may often be in several classes of centrally acting analgesics (eg, a low dose of cyclobenzaprine at bedtime, pregabalin or gabapentin either just at bedtime or twice daily, and a serotonin-norepineprine reuptake inhibitor such as duloxetine or milnacipran during the day). However, our current pharmacological armamentarium is not nearly as well-developed for central pain as for essential hypertension, which is likely one of the reasons that these syndromes are often still difficult to treat. Figure 4 also points out that classes of drugs that are quite effective for \"peripheral\" pain as the result of damage or inflammation in peripheral tissues, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and opioids, are not effective analgesics in central pain states. There are even data suggesting that administering opioids to patients with central pain states could worsen their pain by leading to opioid-induced hyperalgesia, which could augment and worsen the baseline hyperagesia that may be playing a central pathogenic role in these conditions. Just as many pharmacological therapies work across all or most of these conditions, similarly, nonpharmacological therapies such as education, exercise, and CBT have been demonstrated to be effective across nearly all of the CSS conditions [157] [158] [159] . Both exercise and CBT have wide acceptance and are supported by RCTs in CFS.",

Light and colleagues have recently demonstrated that after moderate exercise, CFS and CFS-FMS patients show enhanced gene expression for receptors detecting muscle metabolites and for sympathetic nervous system activation [162] . This finding supports the need for a \"start low, go slow\" therapeutic approach to exercise in CFS, especially because exacerbations after overactivity are very common.",
