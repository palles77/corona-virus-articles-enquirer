A mammary-specific expression vector pEBS containing the full-length cDNA of S gene was constructed and expressed in the mouse mammary cells (EMT6). The recombinant S protein from culture supernatant of transgenic EMT6 was harvested and immunized BALB/c mice. The results demonstrated recombinant S protein was expressed at high levels in mammary cells by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection. The antibody titer in BALB/c mice following immunization with recombinant S protein was detectable after the first immunization. Maximum titers of antibody (8.86 \u00b1 0.19 ng/ml of serum) were attained after the second immunization. In conclusion, the recombinant S protein expressed in mammary cells was able to elicit substantial immunological response against TGEV. This lays the basis for using mammary gland bioreactor generating edible vaccine.",

The rapid spread of the transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) can be prevented only by vaccination. The commercially available vaccines, either inactivated or attenuated, are unable to produce fully protect the piglets (Tuboly et al., 2000) . With the development of bioengineering, some attempts have been made to explore novel vaccines against TGEV. As the major inducer of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies, spike (S) protein has been used as the recombinant subunit vaccine candidate antigen. Gomez et al. (1998) and Tuboly et al. (2000) reported S protein could be expressed in plants. However, expression in eukaryotic hosts is required for antigenic determinants that are dependent on glycosylation. Plant cells present differences in protein glycosylation with respect to animal cells that could determine the lose of antigenic determinants in antigens expressed in transgenic plants (Gomez et al., 1998) . Glycosylation in plants may differ in the extent of glycosylation, processing, or both of N-linked oligosaccharide side chains (Faye et al., 1993) . Furthermore, the complex glycans of plants are often smaller than those of animals, in part due to the absence of sialic acid (Faye et al., 1993) . The post-translational processing of protein in mammalian expression system significantly differ from others expression systems, which inevitably causes the difference in the biological activity of the vial antigen.",

The region between \u2212511 and +487 of the \u2424-casein gene promoter has been shown to confer tissue-specific expression in transgenic mice (Rosen, J.M., personal communication). Furthermore, most of the transcription factor response sites or binding elements on the \u2424-casein gene promoter locate at least within the 2.3 kb 5 of the RNA initiation site (Doppler et al., 1989) . In view of these reason, we designed a mammary gland-specific expression vector with 2.8 kb \u2424-casein promoter. In this study, a 175 kDa band corresponding to the expected size of S protein was detected in the culture supernatant of transgenic cells by Western blotting analysis.

            "text": "In order to confirm whether the recombinant S protein can induce neutral antibody against TGEV, we orally immunized mice and tested sera by ELISA and plaque reduction assay. Mice immunized with the recombinant S protein sera-converted. We obtained antibody levels similar to the result reported by Ho et al. (2005) . Maximum titer of anti-recombinant S protein serum attained 8.86 \u00b1 0.19 ng/ml. Inhibition of viral plaque formation by serum from immunization mice is 14-16%. These results show that S protein is immunogenic. We speculate this is related to the expression system. While a variety of expression vectors have been developed for the efficient synthesis of S protein in other expression systems, in many cases the biological activity of these proteins is impaired because of the failure to process the protein correctly. The mammalian expression system contains the necessary post-translational modification systems requiring for the clevage, phosphorylation and glycosylation of proteins, which should make it possible to efficiently synthesize protein with the high degree of fidelity and secrete biologically important molecules. Therefore, it may be a good choice to express mammalian viral antigen vaccine in mammalian expression systems. Sola et al. (1998) demonstrated that the mouse mammary gland tissue performs the adequate posttranslational processing required for the correct assembly of antibody molecules. The secretion of neutralizing MAbs in the milk of transgenic animals could be applied to improve disease resistance in livestock and to prevent neonatal infections by a number of pathogens for which specific MAbs are available (Sola et al., 1998; Kolb et al., 2001) . This approach may lead to the generation of transgenic animals providing lactogenic immunity to their progeny against pathogens.",

Transgenic rabbit expressing S glycoprotein is currently being made by using the same expression cassette. This new system will allow us to test whether the immunity provided by S protein expression in the milk of transgenic rabbit to mice following challenge with TGEV elicit protection. If we determine the feasibility of expressing immunologically active polypeptides in mice, this strategy will provide a new method to protect animal against viral infections of the enteric tract.",
