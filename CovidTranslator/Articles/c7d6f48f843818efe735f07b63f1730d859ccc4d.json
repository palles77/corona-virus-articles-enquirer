It is an attractive approach to find new uses for old drugs as they have already been through extensive clinical testing and could easily be accelerated for clinical approval. Briefly, we performed virtual screening of a database of small molecules against SARS 3CLpro, analyzed inhibitor-protease complexes, and identified several covalent and non-covalent inhibitors. Several old drugs that bind to SARS 3CLpro active site were selected and in silico derivatized to generate covalent irreversible inhibitors with enhanced affinity. Furthermore, we show that pharmacophores derived from clusters of compounds resulting out of virtual screening could be useful probes for future structure-activity relationship studies (SARs) and fine-tune the lead molecules identified.",

The virus induces symptoms of atypical pneumonia, clinically indistinguishable from similar syndromes and is thought to be of animal origin [1] . In the course of a few months, SARS had spread rapidly from its likely origin in Guangdong Province, China, to 32 countries. World Health Organization (WHO) reported that a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with SARS that was accompanied by either pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome and of these 774 patients died. National laboratories, several biotechnology, and diagnostics firms have joined the global rush to combat the infectious disease [2, 3] . The scientific community has already learnt many important lessons from HIV, which could accelerate anti-SARS drug/vaccine development. WHO declared the global outbreak of SARS was contained, as no new cases were reported by August 2003. However, the virus is not yet eradicated.",

SARS 3CLpro, which plays pivotal role in the viral replication, is one of the potential targets for structure-based drug design. SARS 3CLpro has three domains: I (residues 8-101), II (102-184), and III (201-301). Domains I and II, which contains the active site region, are b-barrel domains and III is an a-helical domain. SARS 3CLpro folds similar to generic serine protease but with a catalytic Cys-His dyad playing critical role in the active site. The protease 0006-291X/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.06.155 reaction is conjured by the active nucleophile Cys-145 and the acid-base catalyst His-41. Structural conclusions from active site similarity within the coronavirus family and virtual screening on homology models have provided some clues regarding the class of compounds that could interact with SARS protease. Rhinovirus 3Cpro inhibitors like AG7088 fit into the active site pocket of SARS 3CLpro and their derivatives could be potential inhibitors of SARS [5] . The X-ray crystal structure of AG7088-bound HRV protease formed the basis for early anti-SARS drug design (PDB: 1cqq). Further, this is supported by the observation that KZ7088, a derivative of AG7088, could interact with the active site of the SARS protease through six hydrogen bonds [6] . Virtual screening on a 3D model of the SARS 3CLpro against a database of 73 protease inhibitors shows that available protease inhibitors could provide clues toward anti-SARS drug design [7] . Molecular dynamics and docking studies using a database of 29 FDA approved compounds suggested that L-700417, a pseudo C2 symmetric HIV protease inhibitor, fits well into the active site compared to AG7088 [8] . Toney et al. [9] have reported that Sanabandine, a compound from the NCI diversity set, could inhibit SARS protease. The first crystal structure of the SARS 3CLpro was reported in July 2003 (PDB: 1q2w) [10] and a set of crystal structures including SARS 3CLpro in complex with a specific hexa-peptide inhibitor have been reported recently (PDB: 1UJ1, 1UK2, 1UK3, and 1UK4) [11] . Bifunctional aryl boronic acid compounds targeting the cluster of serine residues (Ser139, Ser144, and Ser147) near the active site cavity were found to be effective protease inhibitors [12] . At this juncture, researchers revisited the old adage ''old drugs for new bugs'' [13, 14] and started investigating old drugs that show potential of inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV. They have shown that a few old drugs could be used as templates for designing SARS 3CLpro inhibitors [15] . Since these old drugs are originally not designed to inhibit SARS 3CLpro, they have to be fine-tuned to interact with the new target and ''taught'' how to kill new bugs! The present study employs in silico derivatization as a method to ''teach old drugs to kill new bugs.'' We have designed irreversible covalent inhibitors by selective derivatization of top non-covalent leads, which includes several old drugs especially a class of HIV inhibitors identified from virtual screening. Our study has resulted in identification of several peptidomimetics and small molecule candidates as potential non-covalent/covalent inhibitors of SARS 3CL protease.",

A database of more than 15,000 compounds comprising of protease inhibitors (aspartyl, cysteine, serine, and metallo-proteases), HETATM records extracted from PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/) [30] , HIV inhibitors (polymerase, integrase, and reverse transcriptase), and a set of thiol reactive compounds filtered from Maybridge (http://www.maybridge.com), Leadquest (http://www.leadquest.com/), ACD laboratories (http:// www.acdlabschem.com), and NCI small-molecule databases (http:// dtp.nci.nih.gov) was used in the study. Virtual screening of the small molecule inhibitors against SARS 3Clpro was performed using the FlexX module in SYBYL6.9 (Tripos) set at default parameters unless otherwise indicated in the text. We utilized multiple well-known scoring functions: a GOLD-like function [16] , a DOCK-like function [17] , ChemScore [18] , a PMF function [19] , and FlexX [20] to rank order the complexes resulting from virtual screening. A list of top 200 compounds was selected from each scoring function, generated and purged into a dataset of 760 unique compounds. These compounds were subjected to physicochemical filters and merged into single database of 330 compounds. Identified lead molecules were in silico derivatized with suitable thiol reactive warheads. The resultant complexes were subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulations and energy minimization using DISCOVER module of Insight II. Molecular dynamics simulations consisted of an initial equilibration of 5 pico seconds (ps) and followed by 100 ps dynamics at 300 K. The final complex structure at the end of the MD simulation was subjected to 5000 steps of steepest descent energy minimization followed by conjugate gradient energy minimization. For all the above calculations, a distance-dependent dielectric constant and non-bonded distance cutoff of 20 \u00c5 were used. Molecular graphics images were produced using SYBYL6.9 and the UCSF Chimera package from the Computer Graphics Laboratory, University of California, San Francisco (http:// www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera; [21] ). Inhibitor-protease interactions were analyzed using occluded surface (OS) [22, 23] .",

            "text": "Designing specific inhibitors to block SARS 3CLpro requires a clear understanding of the successful inhibitors designed against class of cysteine proteases. The first set of specific covalent inhibitors for proteases has been designed by adding reactive warheads such as diazo compounds or haloketones to a good substrate of the protease under concern. One of the major disadvantages in using early covalent inhibitors such as haloketones arises due to the inherent reactivity towards non-target molecules. This compromises their stability/ selectivity and in turn makes them unsuitable for in vivo studies. The discovery of E64, potent natural epoxysuccinyl inhibitor and Michael acceptors such as AG7088, has shown that lowering the reactivity of the warhead essentially increases the stability, inhibitory potency, and in turn makes them viable for in vivo studies. The entry of AG7088 into clinical trials [24] [25] [26] has rejuvenated the interest in developing irreversible covalent inhibitors for cysteine proteases. Essentially the first step is the subsite mapping with a library of peptide substrates [27] . In lieu of such studies, it is often easier to identify the potential substrate peptide from closer homologues within the family of the protease. A closer examination of the substrate specificity profile of 3C-like proteases of coronaviruses reveals that P1 0 position of the substrate is usually small (Gly, Ala or Ser), a conserved Gln at the P1 position, and the P2 position of the substrates seems to favor large hydrophobic residues. The side chains of His163 and Phe140 and the main-chain atoms of Met165, Glu166, and His172 form the S1 subsite, which confers specificity towards Gln. Thus, specific covalent inhibitors of SARS 3CLpro could be designed by substituting the amino acid at the P1 0 position with a thiol specific reactive organic moiety like chloromethyl ketone. The affinity for the peptide with correct Pi-Pi 0 (where i = 1, 2, 3, etc.) amino acid arrangement has always been the highest. The criteria for any small molecule mimic would be to span the critical length required for the inhibition and make critical interactions with the binding site residues.",

Due to the lack of X-ray crystal structures before July 2003, we constructed several homology models based on TGEV Mpro (PDB ID: 1lvo). Though there were significant differences between the homology models and the available crystal structures, by comparison of RMS deviations of the binding sites of all the structures alone with respect to that of 1uk4, it could be observed that the differences in the binding site are localized to \u00d4minor\u00d5 loop reorganization and side chain orientations (Fig. 1A) . Our homology homologues (1pa5, 1p9s, and 1p9t) and homology models (UNB model [29] and our model) and (II) SARS 3CLpro crystal structures. models were comparable with other models available at that time (Fig. 1B, marked I) . Early structures 1p9s [5] , 1p9t [5] , and 1p9u [5] provided structural basis for initial virtual screening efforts. These were based on the assumption that the substrate peptide binds in the normal mode i.e., conserved Si-Pi and Si 0 -Pi 0 interactions (where i = 1, 2, 3, etc.). However, in the reported CMK-peptide bound crystal structure, Leu-P2 is partially solvent accessible and does not interact with the S2 subsite. This results in a shift in subsite interaction; Thr-P3 and Asn-P5 occupy the S2 and S4 subsites, respectively. This unusual mode of binding could attribute to lower specificity of the P2-amino acid in comparison with other coronaviruses [11] . The authors have also reported large cooperative movements of the side chains of Glu166, Phe140, Leu141, and Tyr118, and the N terminus of the partner protomer in the dimer as a function of pH. Especially there is a marked difference amongst the structures crystallized at different pH (PDB: 1uj1, 1uk2, 1uk3, and 1uk4; Fig. 1B , marked II). Our earlier virtual screening studies with homology models of the SARS 3CLpro provided clues about potential protease inhibitors.",

These compounds could potentially serve as covalent inhibitors of SARS 3CLpro. Analysis of the docked complexes reveals that the thiol reactive functional groups are not properly oriented towards catalytic Cys145 in most of the docked complexes. Out of the 157 complexes only 17 compounds including KZ7088 were oriented properly towards Cys145 but still were 4-5 \u00c5 away to induce possible nucleophilic attack.

The resultant candidates were subjected to in silico derivatization and thiol reactive organic warheads had been incorporated at appropriate chemically viable positions as shown in Fig. 4A . The warheads were covalently ligated to Sc of Cys-145 and the structures were re-minimized and those with bumps and structural deformity arising out of the new linkage were carefully eliminated by visual examination. In this study, we have incorporated thiol-reactive organic moieties or ''warheads,'' extracted from the 157 covalent inhibitors identified in the study, with both fast and slow reactivity as shown in Fig. 4B . Analyses of the inhibitor-bound complexes reveal that covalent inhibitor picks up more interactions compared to its non-covalent analogue. A list of top non-covalent inhibitors selected after secondary rule-based screen with functional groups selected for in silico derivatization is highlighted in red (Figs. 2-4) . Graphical illustration of cyclic urea-based non-covalent inhibitor (colored in orange) and its covalent analogue (colored in cornflower blue) bound to SARS 3CLpro active site is shown in Fig. 5 .

That is, if a water molecule cannot fit between two atoms they occlude each other.

To calculate occluded surface, normals at the molecular surface are extended outward until they intersect neighboring van der Waals surface. The collection of extended normals, and their respective lengths, defines the packing of each atom in a structural model.

In silico derivatization of viable functional groups as identified by the secondary rule-based screen enables the old drugs to react with Cys145 by serving as centers of nucleophilic attack. The use of low and high reactive organic warheads provides means to control the reactivity of the inhibitor, its stability, inhibitory potency and in turn helps in designing inhibitors viable for in vivo studies.

Occluded Surfaces generated scores provide unique and novel method for quantitative comparison of non-covalent and covalent inhibitor bound complexes.
