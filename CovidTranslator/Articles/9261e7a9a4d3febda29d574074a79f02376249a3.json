An essential G1 process is Minichromosome Maintenance complex (MCM) loading at DNA replication origins to prepare for S phase, known as origin licensing. A p53-dependent origin licensing checkpoint normally ensures sufficient MCM loading prior to S phase entry. We used quantitative flow cytometry and live cell imaging to compare MCM loading during the long first G1 upon cell cycle entry and the shorter G1 phases in the second and subsequent cycles. We discovered that despite the longer G1 phase, the first G1 after cell cycle re-entry is significantly underlicensed. As a result, the first S phase cells are hypersensitive to replication stress. This underlicensing is from a combination of slow MCM loading with a severely compromised origin licensing checkpoint. The hypersensitivity to replication stress increases over repeated rounds of quiescence. Thus, underlicensing after cell cycle re-entry from quiescence distinguishes a higher risk cell cycle that promotes genome instability.",

We previously found that stem cells load MCM faster than differentiated cells with long G1 phases to achieve the same amount of loaded MCM at S phase entry (Matson et al., 2017) . An alternative example is the long G1 after cell cycle re-entry from quiescence (Coller, 2007) . Cell cycle quiescence, or \"G0,\" is a reversible cell cycle exit to a nondividing state. G0 is distinct from a G1 arrest; it is an active state requiring upregulation of anti-apoptotic, anti-senescent, and anti-differentiation genes as well as repression of cell cycle genes (Coller et al., 2006; Sang et al., 2008; Litovchick et al., 2007; Sagot and Laporte, 2019) . The longer G1 phase during re-entry likely reflects the need to reactivate and express genes repressed in G0 and other fundamental differences in G1 regulation.",

            "text": "The unique features of G0 and the first G1 phase suggests that origin licensing may be distinctly regulated during cell cycle re-entry. We entertained the notion that the increased G1 length may allow more time for MCM loading, causing a meaningful increase in DNA-loaded MCM when entering S phase compared to subsequent proliferating cell cycles. To test this idea, we used single cell flow cytometry to measure the amount of loaded MCM at S phase entry and live cell imaging to measure cell cycle timing to determine if the amount of loaded MCM differs between cell cycle re-entry and active proliferation. Surprisingly, we discovered instead that cells re-entering the cell cycle from G0 are in fact, routinely and significantly underlicensed rendering them hypersensitive to replication stress compared to proliferating cells. This finding is consistent with a recent report that the first S phase experiences higher spontaneous replication stress, though the source of that endogenous stress was not identified (Daigh et al., 2018) . We report here that MCM loading is slow in the first G1 phase and furthermore, that the first cell cycle has a severely compromised origin licensing checkpoint relative to the robust checkpoint in actively proliferating cells. This combination promotes premature S phase entry and underlicensing. To our knowledge, these results demonstrate the first naturally underlicensed cell cycle and suggest that We then applied this method to measure how much MCM had been loaded by the time of the G1/S transition in the first cell cycle compared to the amount loaded at G1/S in the second cell cycle (Fig. 1B) . We arrested RPE1-hTert cells in G0 by contact inhibition (in the presence of growth serum) for 48 hours. Contact-inhibited G0 cells showed a robust cell cycle exit to G0 with very little loaded MCM; 94% of cells were G0/G1 but only 1% were still in S phase ( Fig. 1C and Fig. S1B ). We then released cells to re-enter the cell cycle by plating at sub-confluent cell density. G0 cells also expressed the expected high levels of p27 and low Cyclin D1 compared to cells in the first cycle (Fig. S1C) . We pulse-labeled cells with EdU and harvested some cells in G0 or at 24 hours when they were a mix of first G1 and ~50-70% first S phase cells. In a separate continuous EdU labeling experiment in which EdU was added at the time of release, we determined that nearly 100% of cells had entered S phase by 28 hours (Fig. S1D) , and almost no cells remained in G0/G1. Thus, we concluded that additional cells we harvested 48 hours after release had completed their first S phase and were into their second cell cycle.",

By the second cell cycle, G1 cells progressed into S phase as a tight group with relatively high amounts of loaded MCM (transition from blue to orange). In contrast, many cells in the first cell cycle entered S phase with low amounts of loaded MCM. This behavior creates the filled orange triangle on flow cytometry plots of the first S phase instead of the normally clear region under a high arc characteristic of the second S phase.

Early S phase cells in the first cycle had a broad range of loaded MCM levels that included many cells with low MCM, whereas early S phase cells in the second cycle primarily had high loaded MCM levels. The second cell cycle was nearly indistinguishable from asynchronously proliferating cells that had not been arrested. We thus used the second cell cycle to define the normal licensing levels, and classified cells with less MCM loaded in early S as \"underlicensed\" (Fig. 1E dashed line) . To visualize and directly compare MCM loading distribution in different populations, we generated histograms of loaded MCM levels in early S phase cells (Fig. 1F ). On this plot the differences between the first and second S phases were also readily apparent (compare orange and grey lines). We quantified the differences as fold change between the mean MCM loaded in the first and second S phases. Cells in the first cycle after re-entry from G0 loaded only half as much MCM as cells in the second cell cycle (Fig. 1G) . We then used this same comparison to test if this underlicensed first cell cycle is common among different untransformed cell lines or methods of quiescence induction. We observed similar underlicensing after quiescence induction in RPE1-hTert by serum starvation and re-stimulation and in two normal fibroblast cell lines arrested by contact inhibition and release . We observed that not only was the mean MCM loaded by the first S phase half that of subsequent S phases, but also that the majority of first S phase cells were underlicensed (Fig. 1H) . Thus, re-entry from G0 is characterized by substantial underlicensing in the first cell cycle.",

Given our observations that the first S phase is underlicensed relative to the subsequent S phase, we hypothesized that cells re-entering the cell cycle from G0 would be hypersensitive to replication stress in the first S phase. To test that idea directly, we treated cells in the first or second cell cycle after G0 with low-dose gemcitabine, a drug that depletes nucleotides to cause replication stress ( Fig. 2A) . We used flow cytometry to measure the expression of \u03b3H2AX, a common replication stress marker (Ewald et al., 2007) (Fig. 2B, and Fig. S2A ). We specifically analyzed mid-S phase cells to account for differences in cell cycle distribution, and we scored the number of \u03b3H2AX-positive S phase cells with expression equal to or greater than the top 5% of untreated cells (Fig. 2C , dashed line). By this measurement, cells in the first S phase after G0 are significantly more sensitive to replication stress than cells in the second S phase (Fig. 2D) . Moreover, gemcitabine-treated first S phase cells expressed double the amount of \u03b3H2AX per cell than cells in the second S phase, suggesting that not only were more total cells exhibiting a replication stress response but also that there was more replication stress per cell (Fig. 2E, F) . This hypersensitivity to replication stress in the underlicensed first cell cycle suggests that cell cycle re-entry is an inherently higher-risk cycle with respect to genome stability compared to subsequent cell cycles.",

We considered the possibility that repeated cell cycle exit and re-entry would lead to additional replication stress sensitivity over time. To measure accumulation of replication stress during repeated cell cycle re-entry, we synchronized RPE1 cells in G0 by contact inhibition for 48 hours and released them into the cell cycle for about 48 hours (~2-3 cycles) and then they became contact inhibited again. We reiterated this procedure for a total of 3 rounds of G0 arrest and re-entry. In the third release, we treated with gemcitabine and measured the induction of \u03b3H2AX as before (Fig. S2B, C) . Cells re-entering S phase from three repeated arrests in G0 (\"3xG0\") were more likely to induce \u03b3H2AX cells than cells that been arrested only once (\"1xG0\"), and these cells were also more intensely \u03b3H2AX positive per cell (Fig. S2D , E). The increased replication stress sensitivity after three rounds of G0 varied somewhat due to inherent variations in the G0 synchronization over multiple rounds Wang et al., 2017) . This variability was reflected by unpaired t test p values of ~p=0.15 for both the number of \u03b3H2AX positive cells and the \u03b3H2AX intensity Fig. S2D , E. Nevertheless, we observed a clear trend that repeated cell cycle re-entry from G0 increased sensitivity to replication stress.",

The consistently high amount of loaded MCM we observed prior to G1/S in the second and subsequent proliferating cell cycles is consistent with an active origin licensing checkpoint (e.g. Fig. 1A arrow) . The origin licensing checkpoint is thought to delay S phase entry when the amount of loaded MCM is still low in untransformed cells by delaying the activation of G1 Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDK) (McIntosh and Blow, 2012) . Evidence for this checkpoint is low CDK activity and lengthening of G1 in proliferating cells treated to reduce MCM loading by RNAimediated depletion of MCM loading factors or by overproduction of the MCM loading inhibitor, Geminin (Shreeram et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2009; Nevis et al., 2009) . The origin licensing checkpoint ensures that S phase begins with abundant licensed dormant origins to tolerate replication stress. Because we observed routinely underlicensed cells in the first S phase after G0 and consistently higher licensing in the second cell cycle, we hypothesized that the origin licensing checkpoint is primarily active in only the second and subsequent cell cycles.",

We therefore sought first to assess checkpoint status in proliferating untransformed epithelial cells (RPE1-hTert). We decreased origin licensing with siRNA targeting Cdc10 dependent transcript 1 (Cdt1), an essential MCM loading protein (Pozo and Cook, 2016) . We used either a pool of four siCdt1 sequences (siCdt1 A) or a single independent siCdt1 (siCdt1 B) and analyzed Cdt1 protein by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B) . We then tested both MCM loading and the length of G1 phase. Cdt1 depletion induced both a reduction in the rate of G1 phase MCM loading (Fig. S3A, B) and also a striking G1 lengthening. G1 length dramatically increased by several-fold (12 to 42 hours for siCdt1B), and the more profound Cdt1 depletion by siCdt1 B caused a greater G1 delay (Fig. 3F , green bars). Importantly, Cdt1 depletion alone changed neither the amount of early S loaded MCM (compare black and grey lines in Fig. 3C , and fold change in Fig.  3D ) nor the percentage of underlicensed early S phase cells (Fig. 3E ). By the time cells finally entered S phase, they had achieved normal amounts of loaded MCM. These observations indicate that actively proliferating RPE1 cells wait for the normal amount of loaded MCM in G1 phase before entering S phase.",

The origin licensing checkpoint delays the activation of Cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 3A ) . To test if the G1 phase delay can be bypassed in Cdt1-depleted RPE1-hTert cells, we overproduced Cyclin E1 to prematurely activate CDK2. We used flow cytometry to measure DNA-loaded MCM, plotting a histogram of early S phase loaded MCM as before ( Fig. 3C and Fig. S3A ). As expected from prior reports, Cyclin E1 overproduction in control cells shortened G1 phase nearly three-fold (siControl vs \u2191Cyclin E1, Fig. 3F , green bars) (Matson et al., 2017; Resnitzky et al., 1994) . In addition Cyclin E1 overproduction alone induced underlicensing as measured by the amount of early S loaded MCM (compare black and red lines, Fig. 3C , and the percentage of underlicensed cells, Fig. 3E ) (Ekholm-Reed et al., 2004; Matson et al., 2017) . Strikingly, when we overproduced Cyclin E1 after Cdt1 depletion (Fig. 3A) , early S phase cells became severely underlicensed, quantified by both MCM loaded per cell (compare grey and orange lines, Fig. 3C and fold change in Fig. 3D ), and the percentage of underlicensed cells (Fig. 3E) . Moreover, G1 length decreased even in the Cdt1-depleted cells (Fig. 3F) . We previously determined that the apparent decease in Cdt1 protein upon Cyclin E1 overproduction is an indirect effect of cell cycle phase distribution because Cdt1 is stable in G1 and unstable in S phase (Matson et al., 2017) . Since Cyclin E1 overproduction bypassed the strong G1 delay in control Cdt1-depleted cells and induced S phase entry with low amounts of loaded MCM, the G1 delay is caused by a bona fide origin licensing checkpoint.",

To test if p53-deficient epithelial cells are more likely to enter S phase underlicensed, we compared isogenic WT and p53 homozygous null RPE1-hTert cells (gift of P. Jallepalli, Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2018) . We analyzed the effects of reduced origin licensing from Cdt1 depletion on both G1 length and early S phase licensing status. We first noted by immunoblotting that Cdt1 depletion induced accumulation of both p53 and the CDK2 inhibitor p21, the product of a p53-inducible gene, whereas p53 null cells lacked both p53 and detectable levels of p21 (Fig. 4B ). The absence of p53 had little effect on either G1 phase MCM loading (Fig. S3C ) or the amount of MCM loaded by early S phase in otherwise unperturbed cells (compare black and grey lines in Fig 4C, fold change in Fig. 4D , and percentage of underlicensed cells in Fig 4E) . As before, Cdt1 depletion slowed MCM loading in WT cells and increased G1 length by several-fold (Fig. 4F, Fig. S3D ). In contrast, Cdt1-depleted cells lacking p53 entered S phase with significantly less MCM loaded (compare red and orange lines in Fig. 4C , fold change in Fig. 4D , and .

Moreover, unlike p53 WT cells, Cdt1 depletion in p53 null cells did not cause G1 lengthening (Fig. 4F) . Thus, loss of p53 cripples the origin licensing checkpoint in proliferating cells, allowing inappropriate premature S phase entry of underlicensed cells. We note that even in control cells that had not been depleted of Cdt1, the p53 null cells entered S phase at a slightly lower amount of loaded MCM on average compared to p53 WT cells (compare black and red lines in Fig. 4C) . We also detected a modest increase in the percentage of underlicensed p53 null siControl cells (Fig. 4E ). Overall we conclude that these untransformed epithelial cells utilize a p53-dependent checkpoint to couple the timing of S phase entry to the status of origin licensing.",

            "text": "We had established in Figures 1 and 2 that cells re-entering the first cell cycle after G0 are routinely underlicensed relative to subsequent cycles. We hypothesized that the first cell cycle has an impaired origin licensing checkpoint that poorly couples the length of G1 phase to the status of MCM loading. To test that hypothesis, we compared actively proliferating cells treated with siCdt1 to G0 cells re-entering the first cycle also treated with siCdt1 (Fig. 5A ). We measured cell cycle phase distribution by DNA Content (DAPI) and DNA synthesis (EdU) (Fig. 5B ). The actively proliferating cells treated with siCdt1 increased the percentage of G1 cells as before, but cells re-entering the first cell cycle from G0 did not similarly respond to Cdt1 depletion (Fig. 5B , green bars). This difference is consistent with a weak origin licensing checkpoint in the first cell cycle. We also tested if the loss of p53 in the first cell cycle enhanced this apparent checkpoint deficiency (Fig. 5C ). Unlike the proliferating cells in Fig. 4F , first cell cycle p53 null cells were no worse than first cell cycle WT cells (Fig. 5D ). We note that siControl p53 null cells re-entering the first cycle also started S phase sooner than their corresponding p53 WT cells based on cell cycle distributions at the same time after G0 release (Fig. 5B 33% G1 vs, 16 .6% G1 in Fig. 5D ). The faster S phase entry by the p53 null cells could be due to both the impaired licensing checkpoint and the general loss of basal p21 protein ( Fig. 5C ) (Overton et al., 2014) , among other possible p53-dependent effects on G1/S progression. The ability of actively proliferating cells to activate the licensing checkpoint to extend G1 combined with the observation that G0 cells do not extend G1 but instead enter S phase underlicensed strongly suggests that cells in the first cell cycle after G0 have an impaired origin licensing checkpoint. more slowly than cells in the second cycle. In both cases, the compromised origin licensing checkpoint is unable to extend G1 in response to the low MCM loading status resulting in an underlicensed first S phase. To distinguish between those explanations, we measured the nuclear accumulation of the Cell Division Cycle 6 (Cdc6) protein, an essential MCM loading protein. Cdc6 is degraded by the Anaphase promoting complex-Cdh1 (APC Cdh1 ) in G1 phase, both in cells re-entering the cell cycle and in proliferating cells (Petersen et al., 2000; Mailand and Diffley, 2005) . CDK2/Cyclin E1 phosphorylates Cdc6 in late G1 to protect it from APC Cdh1 , allowing Cdc6 protein to accumulate (Mailand and Diffley, 2005) . Because Cdc6 is essential for MCM loading, Cdc6 accumulation is one of the limiting steps for MCM loading in G1. The time for MCM loading ends when S phase starts and Cdc6 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Petersen et al., 1999) in addition to many other mechanisms that inhibit rereplication (Truong and Wu, 2011) . Therefore, the time Cdc6 is detectable in nuclei is one proxy for the length of maximum available MCM loading time in G1 phase. Nuclear Cdc6 is also a marker for the functional border between G0/early G1 when MCM is not loaded (or loaded very slowly) and late G1 when MCM can be loaded.",

We imaged an RPE1 cell line stably expressing three fluorescent fusion proteins: 1) full length Cdc6 fused to mVenus (Segev et al., 2016) , 2) Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) fused to mTurq2 to track cell nuclei and the borders of S phase (Burgess et al., 2012; Grant, Kedziora et al., 2018) , and 3) a CDK kinase activity sensor fused to mCherry (Hahn et al., 2009 ). This kinase sensor was previously established to report CDK2 activity in G1 and early S phase and both CDK2 and CDK1 activity in S and G2 phase; it is not a direct reporter of CDK4/6 activity (Spencer et al., 2013; Schwarz et al., 2018) . CDK2 phosphorylates the reporter beginning in late G1 phase to induce export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The higher the ratio of cytoplasmic/nuclear signal, the higher the kinase activity. We imaged RPE1 cells expressing all three biosensors synchronized in G0 and released into the cell cycle for 72 hours, capturing an image every 10 minutes, starting 6.5 hours after release. PCNA-mTurq2 was present throughout the cell cycle and become punctate during S phase (Fig. 6A ). Cdc6-mVenus was not present in G0 due to APC Cdh1 -mediated degradation. Nuclear Cdc6 first appeared in G1 and increased until S phase at which point it was lost from the nuclei and accumulated in the cytoplasm instead. After mitosis, Cdc6 was degraded in early G1 phase, then nuclear Cdc6 increased again later in G1 (Fig. 6A ). The CDK reporter (DHB-mCherry) was nuclear in G0 (low CDK activity) and gradually became cytoplasmic beginning in late G1 (high CDK activity) (Fig. 6A) . We tracked 50 cells through the first and second cell cycles after G0 release. Fig. 6B shows an individual cell trace for nuclear Cdc6 in which the first full cell cycle took nearly 35 hours whereas the second cycle took only 20 hours mostly from the difference in G1 length.",

These data suggest that G1 during cell cycle re-entry is a stretched rather than delayed G1 compared to actively proliferating cells in the second cycle, and cells in the first cycle have a longer amount of available time with high Cdc6 than cells in the second cycle. Cells in the first G1 have more potential time to load MCM and yet, enter S phase with less loaded MCM than cells in the second cycle.

We hypothesized that artificially extending the first G1 phase could rescue the underlicensing of the first S phase by extending time for MCM loading. If successful, then cells would enter S phase with the high amount of loaded MCM typical of proliferating cells. We chose to extend G1 phase using nutlin-3a, a p53 stabilizing drug previously shown to lengthen G1 (Tovar et al., 2006) . We treated cells re-entering the first G1 phase with nutlin-3a beginning in mid-G1 for 8 hours, then washed off the drug to permit passage into S phase and measured the amount of loaded MCM at S phase entry (Fig. 7A, B) . Nutlin-3a stabilized p53, causing p21 protein accumulation. This effect is known to inhibit CDK2 kinase activity and delay S phase entry (Giono and Manfredi, 2007) . An unwanted secondary effect of low CDK2 activity for our purposes is failure to protect Cdc6 in late G1 phase, which would interfere with our goal of extending the time for MCM loading (Petersen et al., 2000; Mailand and Diffley, 2005) . To allow MCM loading during the nutlin-induced G1 arrest, we .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/558783 doi: bioRxiv preprint constitutively expressed a mutant form of Cdc6 that does not require CDK2 activity for stability (Matson et al., 2017) . We then compared licensing and cell cycle progression in these treated cells to untreated cells from the first and second cell cycles (Fig. 7C, Fig.  S4A ). Strikingly, transiently extending the first G1 phase by several hours almost fully rescued licensing in the first cell cycle to the same high level as in the second cell cycle (compare green and grey lines, Fig. 7C , and fold change Fig. 7D ) and decreased the percentage of underlicensed cells to the same low level as the second cell cycle (Fig.  7E ). Unlike the effects of stable Cdc6 on the rate of MCM loading in proliferating cells (Matson et al., 2017) , neither stable Cdc6 alone nor in combination with Cdt1 overproduction increased the rate of MCM loading in the first G1 phase ( Fig. S4B and S4C). These genetic changes also had little-to-no effect on underlicensing in the first S phase ( Fig. S4D-F) . Therefore, the improved licensing by early S phase from nutlininduced G1 extension is due to the increased time for MCM loading, rather than directly improving MCM loading itself.",

To test this prediction, we overproduced Cyclin E1 as cells approached the second cell cycle to shorten the second G1 phase and bypass the checkpoint. We then compared licensing in the second S phase in these Cyclin E1-overproducing cells to both control second S phase and first S phase cells (Fig. 7F , 7G, and Fig. S4G ). The second cell cycle with a bypassed licensing checkpoint strongly resembled the first cell cycle (compare green and orange lines, Fig. 7H , fold change in Fig. 7I , and percentage of underlicensed cells in Fig. 7J ). Taken together, we conclude that cells re-entering the cell cycle from G0 are routinely underlicensed, but that the second and subsequent cell cycles are fully licensed because of a robust p53-dependent checkpoint that ultimately controls the timing of Cyclin E/CDK2-mediated S phase entry.",

This checkpoint couples the activity of CDK to the status of MCM loading such that the G1 CDKs are not activated while MCM loading is still low. Cyclin E1 overproduction can bypass the checkpoint-induced delay and induce premature S phase entry while cells are still underlicensed (Fig. 3 ) (Ekholm-Reed et al., 2004; Matson et al., 2017) . Moreover, p53 loss clearly impairs the normal coupling of MCM loading and S phase entry whereas p53 activation lengthens G1 to give enough time to complete licensing ( Fig. 4 , 5, and 7). These observations fit Hartwell and Weinert's classic definition for a cell cycle checkpoint (Hartwell and Weinert, 1989) .

This relationship is in contrast to a simple inability to progress. Of relevance to the origin licensing checkpoint, we induced S phase entry when the amount of loaded MCM was low, but not completely absent, since RNAi-mediated depletion of MCM loading factors does not prevent all MCM loading. If we could have entirely prevented MCM loading, then of course, there would have been no DNA synthesis even in p53 null or Cyclin E-overproducing cells because MCM is an essential component of the replicative helicase.",

How do cells monitor the status of origin licensing, what conditions satisfy the checkpoint, and how is licensing status coupled to the activation of CDKs? Our results indicate that a 50% reduction in the amount of loaded MCM by the time of S phase entry sensitizes human cells to exogenous replication stress; this level is similar to that reported for checkpointdeficient U2OS cells (Ge et al., 2007) . Some stem cell types have a greater amount of loaded MCM at S phase entry than their differentiated counterparts, suggesting that the licensing threshold may vary by cell type (Ge et al., 2015; Carroll et al., 2018) . The mere existence of the licensing checkpoint was an unresolved question until relatively recently in large part because it appears to be restricted to untransformed metazoan cells (Piatti et al., 1995) . This restriction poses technical challenges for experimentally interrogating the checkpoint because untransformed cells are more difficult to synchronize and manipulate than tumor-derived cells or yeast cells. The fact that p53 status correlates with licensing checkpoint proficiency gives clues that a p53-dependent process, perhaps one or more p53-regulated genes, is involved in efficiently coupling licensing to S phase entry. The discovery here that cell cycle re-entry induces natural underlicensing also suggests future avenues to identify checkpoint mediators. Our analysis of origin licensing status at the G1/S transition using analytical flow cytometry provides a promising opportunity to dissect this pathway in the future.",

In previous studies, MCM loading was artificially slowed to test for checkpoint proficiency in various genetic backgrounds (Shreeram et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2009; Nevis et al., 2009) . Under normal growth conditions however both checkpoint-proficient and checkpoint-impaired cell lines enter S phase with normal high levels of MCM loading. This behavior suggests that MCM loading is usually fast enough to achieve high levels of loaded MCM in advance of the other rate-limiting molecular events necessary to trigger CDK2 activation and S phase entry. It is only slow-loading cells that are visibly affected by the checkpoint. In that sense, the origin licensing checkpoint resembles other cell cycle checkpoints that operate in all cell cycles in that \" ...elimination of the checkpoint may have catastrophic or subtle consequences depending on the prevailing conditions.\" (Hartwell and Weinert, 1989) For example, the .

To our knowledge, cell cycle re-entry from G0 is the first known naturally-occurring underlicensed cell cycle; previous investigations required siRNA or mutations to artificially force underlicensing (McIntosh and Blow, 2012) . Clearly the extra time in G1 after G0 was not enough to lead to full licensing. Our investigation leads us to conclude that the routine underlicensing in cells re-entering the cycle is the consequence of a combination of slow MCM loading plus an ineffective licensing checkpoint. If MCM loading were fast enough in the first cell cycle, then their checkpoint deficiency wouldn't matter and they would not be underlicensed in the first S phase. Although it is not yet technically possible to monitor MCM loading in real time in individual cells, we used the transition from Cdc6-negative to Cdc6-positive as a proxy for the maximum amount of time available for MCM loading (Fig. 6 ). Since cells in the first G1 phase had more time with abundant nuclear Cdc6 than cells in the second G1 phase, yet began S phase with less MCM loaded, we are confident in our assertion that MCM loading is particularly slow in the first G1 phase.",

The difference may be caused by one or more of the fundamental differences in G1 regulation between cell cycle re-entry and active proliferation. These differences include the status of Rb phosphorylation which is monophosphorylated in proliferating G1 cells, but unphosphorylated in G0 (Narasimha, Kaulich, Shapiro et al., 2014) . Rb-dependent genes include those whose products are directly involved in MCM loading, and these genes are subject to unique transcriptional repression by the DREAM complex in G0 that must be reversed at cell cycle re-entry (Litovchick et al., 2007) . Proliferating cells also load MCM both before and after Rb is removed from chromatin, but cells re-entering G1 from G0 only load MCM after Rb is removed from chromatin (H\u00e5land et al., 2015) . CDK2 is constitutively nuclear in proliferating cells, but is cytoplasmic in G0 (Brown et al., 2004; Dietrich et al., 1997) . Of additional particular relevance is the indication of a kinase-independent function of Cyclin E1 to promote loading that is only required in cells re-entering the cycle form G0 but not in other cell cycles (Geng et al., 2003 (Geng et al., , 2007 . These differences illustrate that cell cycle re-entry into G1 from G0 poses additional challenges and requirements not encountered during G1 .

Our findings here suggests a molecular mechanism by which that replication stress is generated. We propose that the underlicensed S phase after the first G1 has higher endogenous replication stress because fewer dormant origins are available. While we did not detect frank DNA damage markers in the absence of exogenous replication stress in our cells, we presume that endogenous stress was generated because these cells were uniquely sensitive to low dose gemcitabine. This hypersensitivity is a hallmark of cells that enter S phase while underlicensed (Woodward et al., 2006; Zimmerman et al., 2013) . The increased endogenous replication stress from too few licensed origins promotes genome instability from a higher frequency of stalled and unrescued replication forks.",

Cell cycle re-entry from quiescence is common in tissues that naturally turn over cell populations (Sosa et al., 2014; Sagot and Laporte, 2019; Wells et al., 2013) . One might imagine however, that one risky cell cycle is a small contributor to overall genome instability. On the other hand, even in actively proliferating cultures, recent studies have detected populations of cells that appear to spontaneously and transiently exit to a quiescence-like state (Spencer et al., 2013; Overton et al., 2014; Arora et al., 2017; Barr et al., 2017) . Such transient cell cycle exit may be even more common in tissues compared than in cell culture conditions that have been optimized for maximal uninterrupted growth. Whether or not that transient quiescence also causes underlicensing is not yet known.",

Interestingly, hematopoietic stem cells acquire DNA damage in the first cycle after G0, accumulate DNA damage over time in older stem cells, and become depleted as they age from repeated cell cycle re-entry (Beerman et al., Walter et al., 2015) . Additionally, quiescent human T cells re-enter the first S phase even when treated with siRNA to substantially reduce the amount of loaded MCM to ~5-10% of their normal loaded amount (Orr et al., 2010) . Taken together, these data suggest that at least some quiescent cells in vivo lack a licensing checkpoint in the first cycle, although it is unknown if the first cell cycle is naturally underlicensed compared to the second cycle in vivo. Old hematopoietic stem cells experience more replication stress in the first S phase after G0 compared to young stem cells, possibly because they express less MCM protein. In that regard, a defective licensing checkpoint would be particularly toxic .

These in vivo studies are consistent with our observation that artificially inducing repeated rounds of quiescence and cell cycle re-entry enhanced replication stress sensitivity (Fig. S2 ). We suggest that over many rounds of quiescence and re-entry, incremental DNA damage accrues from unresolved replication stress or incomplete replication that may pass through mitosis into the next cell generation. The ability of unresolved replication stress to carry forward into subsequent cell cycles was recently established both by artificially inducing underlicensing and by monitoring spontaneous replication stress passing from mother to daughter cells (Moreno et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2017; Ahuja et al., 2016) . Repeated rounds of underlicensed cell cycle re-entry could contribute to the genome damage that drives both aging and oncogenesis. Such accumulating damage could be analogous to the enhanced wear on an automobile that is routinely driven under stop-and-start conditions vs one driven at steady speeds. By that analogy, the most important consequences of entering a high-risk underlicensed cell cycle may appear not in a single cycle, but rather over an organism's lifetime.",

The trace is orange for the first cell cycle and grey for one daughter in the cell second cell cycle. Hours indicate hours from G0 release beginning at 6.5 hours after release. Circles indicate relevant features: rise is first appearance of nuclear Cdc6; peak is maximum nuclear Cdc6 before S phase and cytoplasmic translocation. The \"licensing window\" is the difference between peak and rise. Division is the last image before cytokinesis. c. Quantification of licensing window time (Cdc6 peak time minus Cdc6 rise time) for the 50 cells imaged in Fig. 6A , two complete cell cycles for each cell were analyzed. d. Timing of Cdc6 peak relative to G0 release (first cell cycle) or to division (second cell cycle) for the 50 cells imaged in Fig. 6A , two cell cycles for each cell. e. Ratio of licensing window time divided by Cdc6 peak time for each cell imaged as in Fig. 6A , 50 cells total with both first and second cell cycle f. Ratio of mean cytoplasmic DHB-mCherry divided by mean nuclear DHB-mCherry at the time of Cdc6 peak for the 50 cells imaged in Fig. 6A , two cell cycles for each cell. f. Diagram of experiment. RPE1 cells containing integrated doxycycline inducible exogenous Cyclin E1 were synchronized in G0 by contact inhibition, then released into the cell cycle, adding 100 ng/mL of doxycycline at 24 hours after release to overproduce Cyclin E1 and shorten G1 of the second cell cycle, harvesting cells at 40 hours after release from G0. Untreated cells were harvested at 24 hours (first cell cycle) and 40 hours (second cell cycle) after release from G0. g.

The checkpoint is p53-dependent and robust MCM loading allows CDK2 activation and normal S phase entry.",

Cdt1 depletion by RNAi prevents robust licensing, CDK2 activation, and S phase entry. Cyclin E1 overproduction in Cdt1-depleted cells directly activates CDK2 independently of licensing and induces S phase entry. Right: Diagram of the experimental workflow. Proliferating RPE1-hTert cells containing integrated doxycycline inducible exogenous Cyclin E1 were treated with siControl, or independent siRNAs targeting Cdt1 (siCdt1 A, or siCdt1 B) for 72 hours. 100 ng/mL doxycycline to overproduce Cyclin E1 were added at 48 hours. b.
