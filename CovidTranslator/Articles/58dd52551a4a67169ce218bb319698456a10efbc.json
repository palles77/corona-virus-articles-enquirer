It is estimated that the conventional drug discovery process ending with a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion USD. Fortunately, this scenario has recently changed with the arrival of new approaches. Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization, techniques such as ligand-or structurebased virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In this paper, we review the concept of rational design presenting some of the most representative examples of molecules identified by means of it. Key principles are illustrated through case studies including specifically successful achievements in the field of anticancer drug design to demonstrate that research advances, with the aid of in silico drug design, have the potential to create novel anticancer drugs.

However, recent estimates claim that the number of current targets is over an order of magnitude lower than it could be. 2, 3 On the other hand, the number of organic molecules that can act as drugs is also a matter of debate. More than 100 million small chemical compounds have been already synthesized for their screening on specific targets in public and private laboratories. 4 In addition, it is not only a matter of quantity but also of quality. Until recently, medicines have been discovered either as a result of unexpected investigations----by inspection of natural substances traditionally considered as therapeutic----or in extensive experimental blind screening studies. 5 These drugs, although proven to be useful in the treatment of several pathologies, have significant downsides, like important side effects or low efficiency.

To achieve this goal, many essential Data preparation structure generation conformational analysis Figure 1 Workflow for hit identification: from data preparation to finding new leads. (A) Standard in silico drug design cycle consists of docking, scoring and ranking initial hits based on their steric and electrostatic interactions with the target site, which is commonly referred to as virtual screening. Generally, in the absence of structural information of a receptor, and when one or more bioactive compounds are available, ligand-based virtual prescreening is utilized. This prescreening method is carried out by similarity search. The basic principle behind similarity searching is to screen databases for similar compounds with the backbone of the lead molecule. (B) In many situations, 2D similarity searches of databases are performed using chemical information from the first generation hits. (C) One alternative approach employs a ligand-based pharmacophore strategy that is often partnered with structure-based docking that uses a more stringent scoring matrix to determine the relative score made by matching two characters in a sequence alignment. This enhances the enrichment of initial hits and identifies the best compounds for computational evaluation, which are the second generation hits. (D) In the second phase, the molecular interactions between the target and the hits often identify ligand-based sites for optimizing these metrics for a unique molecular chemotype. (E) Computer algorithms, compounds or fragments of compounds from a database are positioned into a selected region of the structure (docking). These compounds are scored and ranked based on their steric and electrostatic interactions with the target site. (F) Structure determination of the target in complex with a promising lead from the first cycle reveals sites on the compound that can be optimized to increase potency. steps and decisions have to be made in order to eliminate from irrelevant compounds at the beginning, to end up with those that show better potential activity or have side effects and show interaction with other drugs.

The argument to justify the success of a new drug design is based on the features of preexisting ligands, a concept known as molecular similarity; compounds with high structural similarity are more likely to have similar activity profiles. 12 This methodology is considered an indirect approach to drug discovery, and it is usually used when the 3D structure of the target is unknown or cannot be predicted.",

Those new compounds show a high degree of complementarity with the pharmacophore, and are likely to be active against the protein target of interest; thus, they require a detailed and more fine study. This approach has been used extensively in de novo design, virtual screening, lead optimization and multitarget drug design, becoming a key computational strategy for facilitating drug discovery in the absence of a macromolecular target structure. 18 QSAR method consists of finding a simple equation that can be used to calculate some property from the molecular structure of a compound. In QSAR modeling, the predictors include physicochemical properties or theoretical molecular descriptors of chemicals. As a result, a simple mathematical relationship is established. Applications of QSAR can be extended to any molecular design purpose, including prediction of different kinds of biological activities, lead compound optimization and prediction of new structural leads in drug discovery. The process of building a QSAR model is similar, apart from what type of property is being predicted. It consists of several steps, which lead to the design of new compounds with the desired activity profile. 19 The first step involves the selection of a training set of compounds with their experimental activities to build a QSAR model. Ideally, each of these activities should cover the range of possible values for that activity. The next step is to compute descriptors that contain sufficient relevant information about the biological phenomenon. Despite the initial difficulty to predict in advance which descriptor variables will be valuable once descriptors have been calculated, one of them should be included in the QSAR model. A correlation coefficient gives a quantitative measure of how well each descriptor describes the activity. Thus, the descriptor with the highest correlation coefficient can be picked. Next, data analysis is needed to calculate the best mathematical expression linking together the descriptors and biological activities, in which information relating the essential features of the chemical and biological data structure is obtained. In the final step, validation and predictions for non-tested compounds will take place. An experimental validation of the model needs to be done, for example, by verifying already biologically tested compounds (test-set). If the QSAR predicts within acceptable restrictions, it may be used for a more extensive prediction of more compounds. Results should be interpreted for the proposal and design of new compounds with the desired activity outline.",

Molecular docking is a molecular simulation technique widely used to research the interaction between the ligand and target. The docking process is the virtual simulation of the energetic interaction between the ligand and the target, including the prediction of the best ligand conformation and orientation within the binding site. 20 Docking is a method that predicts the preferred orientation of one small molecule bound to a target, forming a stable complex. It consists of multiple steps. The process begins with the application of docking algorithms that pose small molecules within the active site of the target. Algorithms are complemented by scoring functions that are designed to predict the biological activity through the evaluation of interactions between compounds and potential targets. Early scoring functions evaluate compound fits based on calculations of approximate shape and electrostatic complementarities. Pre-selected conformers are often further assessed using more complex scoring schemes with a more detailed treatment of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, and the inclusion of at least some solvation or entropic effects. 21 Thus, docking programs have mainly three purposes. First, docking programs serve to identify potential ligands from a library of chemical compounds. Second, they can predict the binding mode of potential ligands or known ligands. Finally, using the predicted binding pose, these programs calculate putative binding affinities used as a score to identify those compounds which are more likely to bind the drug target.",

In this case, a pharmacophore can be defined on the analysis of the target binding site (macromolecule (without ligand)based) or based on a macromolecule-ligand-complex. The macromolecule-ligand-complex-based approach is convenient when a ligand is located at the ligand-binding site of a macromolecular target and the key interaction points between ligands and macromolecule need to be determined.

            "text": "An interesting example of structure-based pharmacophore modeling is the identification of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) inhibitors. 52 PUMA is a proapoptotic protein, member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Its expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor p53. 53, 54 PUMA ablation or inhibition leads to apoptosis deficiency underlying increased risks for cancer development and therapeutic resistance. This cancer-treatment target is central in mitochondria-mediated cell death by interacting with all known antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. 54 Based on the binding of BH3-only proteins with Bcl-2-like proteins, some approaches have been used to identify small molecules that can modulate these interactions and therefore, inhibit apoptosis. Most of the efforts have focused on the development of Bcl-2 family inhibitors that mimic the actions of the pro-apoptotic BH3 domains. Such compounds have been identified through computational modeling, structure-based design, and high-throughput screening of natural product and synthetic libraries. 55 On the other hand, Liu et al. reported a combinatorial computational strategy for discovering potential inhibitors against insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which is associated with several cancers, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer. IGF-1R belongs to the tyrosine kinase family and plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathway involving cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. The initial hit obtained from hierarchical VS was subsequently used as the query scaffold for the substructure search to build a focused library. The library was then screened against IGF-1R with an in-house pharmacophore-constrained docking protocol. Eventually, 15 out of 39 compounds exhibited inhibitory activity in enzymatic assessment. Strikingly, the two most potent inhibitors demonstrated an excellent inhibitory potency (IC50 = 57 and 61 nM, respectively), and also presented significant selectivity over the insulin receptor (IR), which is highly homologous to IGF-1R. 56 The authors concluded that the promising selective IGF-1R inhibitors----aside from being potential antitumor agents----could be investigated as molecular probes to differentiate the biological functions of IGF-1R and IR.",

            "text": "Another successful example of small molecules designed using a ligand-based approach is the case of tubulin inhibitors. 57 Tubulin polymerization, an essential component of cell cycle progression and cell division represents an important target for anticancer therapy. Several antimitotic agents (paclitaxel, colchicine, and the vinca alkaloids) have been discovered and are clinically used, but they often show significant toxicity, low bioavailability, rapidly acquired resistance and the resulting overexpression of drug-resistant pumps that eject these antimitotic inhibitors from the cell. However, due to these unfavorable properties, researchers have devoted substantial effort to discover new agents with more tolerable and efficient properties, particularly as it is believed that antimitotic agents could work to diminish blood supply to cancerous tumors. Liou et al. based their model generation on a set of 21 indole-derivatives synthesized originally for potential tubulin inhibition and used structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis to drive it. These compounds were chosen such that their inhibitory IC50 values spanned over three orders of magnitude, from 1.2 nM to 6 M. Based on the chemical similarities of these compounds, the authors selected four common pharmacophoric features----including a hydrogen bond donor, a hydrogen bond acceptor, a hydrophobic group, and a hydrophobic aromatic group----for the construction of a chemical library. Subsequently, 142 compounds were biologically tested using a human oral squamous carcinoma cell line (KB). Among these 142 biologically tested compounds, four were found to inhibit the KB cell line with IC50 values of 187 nM, 2.0 M, 3.0 M, and 5.7 M, respectively. The most potent compound of these four active molecules was also found to inhibit the proliferation of other cancer cell lines like MCF-7 (breast cancer), NCI-H460 (human non-small-cell lung cancer), and SF-268 (human central nervous system cancer), with IC50 values of 236 nM, 285 nM, and 319 nM, respectively. 58 Another example of small molecules designed using a computational approach is the case of an I-Kappa-B Kinase \u2424 (IKK-\u2424) inhibitor. 59 IKK-\u2424, which is a key player in the NF-B signaling pathway, represents yet another potential target for the treatment of cancer in addition to inflammation. In 2011, Noha et al. decided to use ligandbased pharmacophore modeling to identify new compounds with affinity to IKK-\u2424. The ligand-based pharmacophore model for this study was based on a set of five compounds with high activity (IC50 values of 100 nM or less) and at least a several-fold difference in selectivity for IKK-\u2424 over NFB in an attempt to develop an IKK-\u2424 inhibitorspecific pharmacophore model. The model was further refined using a dataset extracted from the literature of 44 biologically inactive compounds, 128 active compounds, and 12,775 several random decoy compounds. The top ten high-scoring compounds were tested in vitro. Among these, the most potent inhibitor (compound NSC-719177) could inhibit IKK-\u2424 with an IC50 value of approximately 6.95 M. 59 Cell-based analyses were also conducted to test the ability of compound NSC-719177 to inhibit NFB activation in HEK293 cells stably transfected and carrying a luciferase reporter gene activated by a promoter composed of multiple copies of the NF-B response element. Compound NSC-719177 was found to have a cell-based assay IC50 value of approximately 5.85 M and exhibited dosedependent activity in inhibiting TNF-\u2423-induced luciferase activity. Therefore, Noha et al. were able to demonstrate the successful application of ligand-based approaches to the identification of low micromolar inhibitors against IKK-\u2424. 59 In an attempt to articulate how the iterative process of structure-based design can lead to the development of drugs with pharmacological potential, more examples from the literature are listed in Table 1 . 60---100 With the evolution of significantly more sophisticated molecular modeling tools and the use of high-throughput X-ray crystallography for a target alone or in complex with small molecules, rational drug design techniques have become an indispensable instrument for the development of target-based therapies. Considering the relevance of the examples cited above, and the importance of these approaches, our research group is interested in finding some molecules capable of inhibiting the transcription factor called Yin-Yang 1 (YY1). This factor has been observed to be overexpressed in cancer patients, and its activation is significantly involved in chemotherapy resistance mechanisms. In pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) it was reported that YY1 is overexpressed. 101 The in vitro inhibition in ALL cell lines showed that YY1 has an important implication in chemoresistance in these cells. Based on these findings, our research group was particularly interested in identifying some inhibitors of the activity of this transcription factor employing CADDD tools. The elucidation of the structure of the YY1 and site-binding domain provides a new framework to understand the functions of this transcription factor and leads to the development of rational drug design for the treatment of ALL. An overview of YY1 structure and activity, its actions in lymphoblastic leukemia and chemoresistance, and how structural information and highthroughput screening have been or can be used for drug discovery will be provided in the future.",

With the required computational hardware and software, and the expertise in biochemistry, biophysics, and biology, many projects that previously demanded a significant investment in time and money can be done today by a small group of researchers in their workstations. Moreover, challenging projects not even conceivable two decades ago can be today tackled with the access to a supercomputer. By using CADDD approaches, researchers are not only accelerating their steps and projects. Implementing molecular simulations in biomolecular research projects has increased our knowledge in fields such as structural and chemical biology at the point where these tools are considered as other useful facilities in the laboratory.
