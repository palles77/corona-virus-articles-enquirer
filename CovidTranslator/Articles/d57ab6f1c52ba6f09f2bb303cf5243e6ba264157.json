            "text": "To the Editor: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory viral epidemic with devastating impact on economics and the practice of medicine. 1 SARS struck Taiwan in the Spring of 2003, causing many deaths, serious morbidity and closure of provincial hospitals. The high infectious rate by droplet transmission places anesthesiologists at a substantial risk during tracheal intubation. Two physicians were infected during intubation resulting in mortality at the early stage of SARS in Taiwan. In addition to wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), using powered air purifying respirators (PAPR) during tracheal intubation can completely eliminate SARS-CoV contamination. PPE consisted of double gowns, double gloves, Tyvek hood (Texas America Safety Company, Brownwood,  TX, USA), N95/100 mask (3M, Taipei, Taiwan),  goggles and face shield. However, wearing PPE with PAPR renders the user with impaired hearing, vision and communication. Verifying correct tracheal intubation by using a stethoscope for auscultation became difficult. There were 31 SARS patients who required tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation at the Taipei-Veterans General Hospital. A total numbers of 37 intubations were performed because four patients had double intubations and one patient had triple intubations. In order to prevent cough with high viral content during intubation, after preoxygenation the tracheal intubation was facilitated by iv administration with propofol and succinylcholine. We then connected the disposable colorimetric end-tidal CO 2 detector (the Nellcor\u00ae Easy Cap\u2122 II) to the endotracheal tube to verify the correct endotracheal tube placement.",

It is also a semi-quantitative capnometer devoid of electronics. The EasyCap\u2122 II detector detects carbon dioxide in exhaled gases via a chemical coloured membrane and changes colour from purple to yellow. Such a change indicates the presence of CO 2 in the exhaled gas which passes. In our experience, the colour of the colorimetric end-tidal CO 2 detector changed from purple to yellow within six cycles of breathing ventilated by ambu-bagging after endotracheal intubation in SARS patients.",

            "text": "To the Editor: A 61-yr-old male patient was scheduled for open retropubic prostatectomy. Medical history consisted of arterial hypertension and ischemic cardiopathy treated medically (nitrates and diltiazem chlorhydrate). Preoperatively, the patient did not complain of chest pain and functional capacity was good. Physical examination, resting electrocardiography and usual preoperative blood tests were normal. The patient did not take his morning diltiazem, arriving to the operating room 36 hr after his last dose. Induction of anesthesia was achieved by iv propofol, sufentanil, and rocuronium. Maintenance of anesthesia was with inhaled sevoflurane (1-2% end-tidal) and iv boluses of sufentanil and rocuronium as needed. Surgery was uneventful. On PACU arrival, the patient was fully awake, responsive and free of pain. Systemic blood pressure was 118/66 mmHg, heart rate 62 beats\u00b7min -1 , and pulse oximetry 99%. A few minutes later, the patient developed ventricular fibrillation (VF). He was resuscitated as per the Adult Advanced Cardiac Life Support algorithm. 1 During the next hour, episodes of VF occurred inducing hemodynamic instability. The 12-lead electrocardiogram recorded during normal sinusal rhythm showed diffuse and massive ST-segment elevation. Cardiac catheterization was decided. During the transfer, he developed electromechanical dissociation and despite adequate resuscitation, the patient remained 30 min without a detectable pulse. After a last 1 mg administration of epinephrine, the heart rate normalized. The coronary angiogram showed a severe, diffuse coronary spasm, leading to the diagnosis of variant angina. Intracoronary nitroglycerin immediately relieved the spasm, uncovering a normal coronary anatomy. The patient made a rapid recovery. This case is illustrative of possible causes of VF in the PACU: coronary spasm due to undiagnosed variant angina or acute withdrawal of calcium-channel blockers.",
