During infection animals experience a characteristic transient leucopenia and the number of cells per volume of blood changes over time; so quantitation of viral load by reference to a cellular housekeeping gene is not ideal as this may hide significant animal to animal variation. Therefore, to facilitate comparison of different samples, an external RNA reference was used for normalisation whereby each sample was spiked with the RNA virus, Canine Enteric Coronavirus (CECov), prior to RNA extraction, for comparative purposes. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out with two primer sets designed to amplify either a 156 bp region of the BVDV 5 -UTR or a 280 bp region of the CECov nucleocapsid protein gene. Linearity and efficiency of the assay was established and the method assessed using samples from BVDV-challenged calves.",

            "text": "Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is a pathogen of worldwide importance for cattle, causing significant economic losses (Brownlie, 1991) . BVDV is classified within the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae (Heinz et al., 2000) . Pestiviruses are small, enveloped viruses that contain a single-strand positive sense RNA molecule of approximately 12.5 kb. The genome is transcribed as a single open reading frame, flanked by 5and 3 -untranslated regions (UTRs). The BVDV polyprotein is co-and post-translationally cleaved to give rise to a number of viral structural and non-structural proteins (Collett et al., 1988) . Acute BVDV infection is often clinically unapparent or mild; clinical signs including transient pyrexia, leucopenia, oculonasal discharge and depression. Although frequently unnoticed, acute infection can contribute to or cause a variety of problems including diseases of the reproductive, respiratory and enteric systems (Baker, 1995) . BVDV infection during preg-nancy may result in foetal infection. Foetuses infected before the onset of immunocompetence can become persistently infected. Persistently infected (PI) animals continuously shed virus and act as a major reservoir of infection for other cattle (Paton et al., 1999) .",

Furthermore, real-time PCR is a quantitative technique and as such may be used to assess viral RNA levels. Real-time RT-PCR methods for genotyping BVDV have been described previously Weinstock, 2001, 2003; Lettellier and Kerkhofs, 2003) . These papers have focused on the detection and classification of BVDV into either of the two recognised genotypes (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2) rather than monitoring the changes in viral load during the course of an acute or persistent infection.

            "text": "Using real-time PCR to quantify the viral RNA levels in BVDV-infected animals presents particular technical and biological challenges. Collection and processing of samples from different animals over a number of different days inevitably results in some degree of sample to sample variation in the technical detection of the target nucleic acids. This arises from differences in efficiency of RNA extraction, reverse transcription or PCR reactions which is made particularly significant by the sensitivity of this technique. These technical variations are often \"controlled\" for by normalisation of the signal to an internal standard, typically a \"housekeeping\" gene, facilitating the comparison of different data sets. This presents two further problems: firstly, whilst this is common practice, such housekeeping genes are rarely truly static and may alter under experimental conditions (Thellin et al., 1999; Whelan et al., 2003) . To take account of this, best practice would recommend assessing the validity of a number of different housekeeping gene targets and comparing them under the test conditions used. This laborious task is the only way to objectively identify more stable mRNA sets. However, this process is not relevant to the BVDV situation during infection as, secondly, during acute infection with BVDV animals experience a measurable leucopenia and the number of cells per volume of blood changes over time. Traditional methods of virus isolation quantitate the amount of virus recovered from a fixed volume of blood irrespective of the cell numbers in this sample, which during acute BVDV infection will fluctuate (Polak and Zmudzinski, 2000) . By standardising the viral RNA measured by real-time PCR to a housekeeping gene set the quantitation is essentially done on a per cell basis rather than a per volume basis rendering the comparison of samples from leucopenic calves more difficult and precluding a simple comparison with more traditional virological methods.",

While the external standard is not an exact mimic of the true target it is subject to the same experimental procedures and provides an external standard for correction of differences in the efficiency of RNA extraction or RT-PCR.

After an initial acclimatisation period the calves were challenged intranasally with 2 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 of virus 456497 (early passage BVDV-1; kindly donated by VLA, Weybridge, UK). EDTA blood samples were taken at appropriate days postchallenge to process for virus isolation and real-time PCR. All EDTA blood samples taken for virology were prepared by lysis of the erythrocytes using ammonium chloride lysis buffer. The samples were subsequently pelleted and washed, as described in Nobiron et al. (2003) . To detect BVDV, the samples were diluted 1:5 in maintenance medium and then seeded, in duplicate, onto freshly prepared foetal bovine lung (FBL) cells and incubated for 5 days at 37 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 . After one round of freeze thaw and dilution of material, the inoculum was passed once more onto FBLs, which had been previously seeded onto coverslips, and incubated for a further 5 days.

First 400 l blood was thawed and 50 l CECov (1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /ml) added as an external RNA reference. This was added to 400 l protease solution followed by 400 l buffer AL.

SYBR \u00ae Green I dye was used in this real-time RT-PCR method, which binds to any double stranded DNA produced in the reaction. Each reaction contained 10 l SYBR \u00ae Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix for QPCR (Sigma), 2.5 l forward primer (10 pmol/l), 2.5 l reverse primer (10 pmol/l) and 5 l template cDNA.

Viral RNA copies per ml of blood were higher on day 6 than on day 14 in three of the five calves although this difference was only statistically significant in calf 10 (P = 0.018). The remaining two calves had very similar levels of viral RNA on both days 6 and 14 post-infection.

Lettellier and Kerkhofs (2003) demonstrated using a BVDV type 1 virus stock that there were 2400 copies of virus genome per infectious particle. This presumably reflects a ratio of infectious to defective viral genomes. Similar ratios have been observed for Yellow Fever Virus (Bae et al., 2003) . The results from the current study would support these observations and, in vivo at least, it is proposed that although BVDV RNA is still being detected, infectious virus has been complexed with antibodies thereby leading to cessation of viraemia. In the case of calf 20, virus neutralising antibody titres of 1:564 were measured on day 14 (data not shown), supporting this premise.",

However, housekeeping gene expression can vary and the use of these genes as internal controls should be carefully considered in relation to cell type and the cell metabolism (Thellin et al., 1999) . The large number of publications focusing on the validation of internal reference genes demonstrates the difficulty in selecting appropriate candidates. Indeed, many authors now recommend the use of at least two (Dent et al., 1997) or three (Bustin, 2000; Vandesompele et al., 2002) validated housekeeping genes to ensure the accuracy of data. In addition, the use of housekeeping genes to control for the variation in RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis is difficult when a fixed amount of blood is analysed (Johansson et al., 2000) . The normal range of leucocyte counts in blood from healthy cattle is 4-12 \u00d7 10 9 l \u22121 (Blood, 1994) , thus demonstrating a potential threefold variation in cell numbers. Furthermore, acute BVDV infection causes transient leucopenia, leading to a reduction in numbers of circulating leucocytes which can be pronounced. Virus virulence as well as host factors may result in the reduction of white blood cells ranging from mild to severe. In the current study all five calves were challenged with the same dose of virus and the degree of leucopenia varied from animal to animal (Fig. 1) .",

A second RNA virus, Canine Enteric Coronavirus (CECov) was used as a control for the each stage of the method. To enable ease of sample handling the method was based on quantification of BVDV RNA per volume of frozen whole blood. Each bovine blood sample was spiked with a known amount of the reference CECov prior to RNA extraction. The coronavirus was co-extracted and subsequently amplified in a quantitative manner. This enabled validation of nucleic acid isolation and amplification efficiency for each sample and detection of those samples for which sample preparation or amplification failed by determining the signal generated from the CECov standard. This system of 'spiking' samples with a heterologous virus has been used previously for Hepatitis C virus quantification (Cleland et al., 1999; Castelain et al., 2004) and for the detection of Epstein-Bars virus and Cytomegalovirus (Niesters, 2001) .",
