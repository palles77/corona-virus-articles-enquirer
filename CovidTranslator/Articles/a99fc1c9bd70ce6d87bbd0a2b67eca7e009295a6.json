(a) Co-immunohistochemical staining of MERS-CoV NP (green) and a podocytespecific marker, podocin (red) in a primary human podocyte cell line 1 24 h after the challenge of MERS-CoV. (b) Western blot analysis of MERS-CoV NP in MERS-CoV-and mock-infected podocytes. \u03b3-tubulin was also detected as a loading control. Total RNAs (c) and the conditioned media (d) of the MERS-CoV-inoculated podocytes were harvested for viral load detection at the indicated time-points using RT-qPCR as previously described. 2 The MERS-CoV RNA from the cell lysates were normalized to the expression level of GAPDH mRNA. Images shown in a and b are representatives of three independent experiments. Error bars shown in c and d represent the mean \u00b1 s.d. of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t-tests and the ranges of p-values were indicated in c and d. Samples from a, b, c and d represent biological replicates.

Apoptosis due to MERS-CoV infection in kidney cells or overexpression of Smad7 and FGF2 in uninfected kidney cells. (a) HK2 cells were infected by MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV at M.O.I. = 9.6, separately. At different time-points (0, 16, 28 and 34 hpi), the infected cells were assayed by terminal deoxynucleotidy transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. The degree of apoptosis (top) was measured by counting the number of positively stained cells (red focal stain; bottom) over the total number of cells in the counted fields (blue nuclei counterstained by DAPI; bottom). Statistical analyses of the percentage of apoptotic cells induced by MERS-CoV over that of SARS-CoV were evaluated by Student's ttests and the ranges of p-values were indicated on top of each time-point. Immunostainings of the virus NP (green; bottom) in each infection condition were included. (b) HK2 cells were transfected with overexpression constructs of Smad7 and FGF2 followed by the detection of apoptosis using TUNEL assays as described above. Different doses of cDNA (0, 0.25 and 0.5 \u03bcg) were first topped up to 0.5 \u03bcg with their vector backbone plasmids followed by transfection. The degree of apoptosis (top) was measured by counting the number of positively stained cells (red focal stain; bottom) over the total number of cells in the counted fields (blue nuclei counterstained by DAPI; bottom). Images shown in a and b are representatives of three independent experiments. Error bars shown in a and b represent the mean \u00b1 s.d. of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t-tests and the ranges of p-values were indicated in a and b. Samples from a and b represent biological replicates.

(a) The relative expression levels of Smad7 and FGF2 in MERS -CoV-and SARS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells were quantified by RT-qPCR as described. 2 (b) The relative expression levels of BIRC 3 mRNA in MERS-CoV-infected or mock-infected Calu-3 and HK2 cells were measured by RT-qPCR. (c) The effect of overexpressed BIRC3 on MERS-CoV replication in Calu-3 (top) and HK2 (bottom) were measured by RT-qPCR. (d) Other deregulated genes not directly related to apoptosis, clusterin (CLU), superoxidase dimutase 1 (SOD1) and catalase (CAT) which expressions were affected by MERS-CoV infection as shown in Fig. 2c, were selected for investigating their effects on MERS-CoV replication. Their expressions were individually knocked down by siRNA transfection followed by MERS-CoV infection. The viral loads were measured as described above. All values were normalized to the expression level of GAPDH mRNA. Error bars shown in a and b, c and d represent the mean \u00b1 s.d. of three independent experiments and experiments done in triplicate, respectively. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t-tests and the ranges of p-values were indicated in a, b and c. Samples from a, b, c and d represent biological replicates.

(b) HK2 cells transfected with siSmad7 (left) or siControl (right) were infected with high (M.O.I. = 9.6; black) or low (M.O.I. = 0.096) viral titer of MERS-CoV.

The viral loads were measured by RT-qPCR as we previously described 2 and then compared with that of the siControl-transfected HK2 cells (black). The red line indicates the viral loads from the supernatants of the siSmad7transfected HK2 cells at 12 hpi. (b) Negative stranded MERS-CoV RNA detection of the siSmad7-and siControl-transfected HK2 cells. Specific primer was designed to reverse transcribe the negative stranded of the MERS-CoV RNAs isolated from the infected cells at different time-points as described in (a). (c) Western blot analysis of the MERS-CoV NP from the siSmad7-and siControl-transfected HK2 cell lysates. Protein samples harvested at different time-points of the infected cells (described in (a)) were resolved in sodium sulfate polyacrylamide gel followed by the detection using anti-MERS-CoV NP antibodies. \u03b3-tubulin was detected as a loading control.
