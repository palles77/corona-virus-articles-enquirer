In fact, it was largely based on our success in providing supportive housing (i.e. housing with on-site supportive services such as case management, substance treatment) for people with AIDS, that our health department developed a supportive housing program for people with other medical illnesses. We have found that using a supportive housing model we have been able to take people suffering from mental illness, substance abuse, and other chronic illnesses (e.g. diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) directly from the street and place them. Because this group has high medical costs when they are homeless, we have found supportive housing programs to be extremely cost effective: a month of housing costs less than a single day in our acute care hospital. The programs have also been able to retain two-thirds of clients in housing for two years or more.",

Confidentiality concerns precluded population-based sampling. Because of the long latency period between HIV seroconversion and development of AIDS, estimated at a median of 10 years, neither AIDS reporting nor HIV antibody tests were an effective means of determining where recent infections were occurring (Rutherford, 1990) . Nonetheless, these challenges led to the development of creative surveillance models. Often in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we developed a variety of surveillance tools including phone surveys, clinic-based surveys, venue-based surveys, blinded seroprevalence studies, and, in more recent years, the sensitive/less sensitive 'detuned' ELISA, to provide detailed data on the epidemic. We also did specialized studies to focus on small, hidden populations that were never represented in sufficient number in countywide surveys. For example, we conducted surveys of young men who have sex with men (Valleroy et al., 2000) , transgendered individuals (Clements-Nolle et al., 2001) , and homeless youth (Gleghorn et al., 1998) . As Buehler has noted, the use of multiple surveillance methods to characterize the AIDS epidemic has informed efforts on how to maintain surveillance for emerging infections as well as chronic diseases (Buehler, 2003) .",

Because testing is anonymous, it cannot be reported to health departments in the way that laboratories and clinicians report other communicable diseases. Therefore, any further action depends on the willingness of the client to disclose their result.

(Interestingly, we have reused the concept recently to counter an increase in syphilis cases among men who have sex with men. We introduced the character the Healthy Penis along with his nemesis Phil the syphilis sore at the Gay Pride Parade to raise awareness of the growing number of cases.) The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence (a group of men dressed in nuns' habits) dispensed safe-sex advice along with condoms. People volunteered to participate in studies like the San Francisco City Clinic Cohort and the San Francisco Men's Study so as to contribute to knowledge about HIV. The overall effect was development of a peer norm that emphasized the importance of each person protecting himself or herself against HIV.",

We handled this in the case of a gay/bisexual/queer and questioning youth empowerment model (Q action) (Wohlfeiler, 1997) by funding them to convene meetings of youth, ask the youth what type of program they wanted to do, and then use the money to implement the program.

Why should focusing on HIV/AIDS exclusively, rather than using HIV/AIDS as an opportunity to highlight the broader problems with our health system be effective? The major reason is that it is much harder to provide the resources necessary to fix the health system, so that all people suffering from life-threatening diseases (AIDS in the era prior to the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy) or chronic diseases (AIDS in the era post development of effective therapy) receive the treatment they need. For example, the Ryan White (CARE) Act pays for a number of services -case management, substance abuse, transportation and housing -that people who suffer from diseases of equal severity are not able to access. Sometimes this produces ironic discrepancies in availability of care. For example, because of the success of HIV/AIDS advocacy in producing funding through the Ryan White CARE Act as well as local and state funding sources, I can arrange a residential substance treatment bed or a methadone maintenance slot within a day for one of my injection drug-using HIV-infected patients. However, for one of my uninfected injection drug-using patients, the wait for these services is several months. The irony of course is that substance treatment could potentially prevent the uninfected person from becoming infected. This discrepancy in funding availability has been referred to as 'AIDS exceptionalism' and has placed AIDS programs open to being attacked as unjust or unfair to other stigmatized populations with serious disease (e.g. mentally ill people) (Casarett and Lantos, 1998 ).",

For example, many of the successes of HIV/AIDS activism can be attributed to the formation of ACT UP groups in several major cities in the United States and Europe. ACT UP stands for AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power and was formed in New York City in 1987 by activist Larry Kramer (Valdiserri, 2003) . The civil disobedience tactics of these groups -closing bridges, sit-ins at governmental offices, booing speakers so that they could not be heard -while upsetting to some, unquestionably brought attention and results. This strategy was also made more successful by having other AIDS activists participate in advisory groups in more conventional ways. Agreeing to follow the recommendations of the more 'moderate' elements became a way of avoiding having to deal with the more extreme part of ACT UP. The effect of this 'good cop/bad cop' was seen in almost every facet of the struggle against AIDS. In fact, even the very definition of AIDS was heavily influenced by activism. Activists were rightly concerned that the surveillance definition used by the CDC was too narrow, with the result that many people were dying of AIDS without being counted. As a result, the 1992 expansion of the AIDS definition included three indicator diagnoses which were thought to be particularly common among disenfranchised people with HIV: recurrent bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and cervical cancer (CDC, 1992; Buehler, 2003) .",

And when investigators failed to provide these types of studies, advocates taught research subjects how to get their medications tested outside of the study so they could learn whether they were receiving placebo or active medications.

These losses have been difficult to sustain because while the incidence of AIDS (the annual number of new AIDS cases) has dropped dramatically, the number of people living with AIDS has dramatically increased. The reason is that HAART has resulted in fewer people developing AIDS but has resulted in an even greater reduction in the number of AIDS deaths.",

To date, most of the costs of AIDS drugs have been covered via a combination of federal and state funding through the Medicaid program and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). ADAP is funded through the Ryan White Care Act. In 2003, the funding for ADAP (federal and state) was US$948 million (http://www.hab. hrsa.gov/programs/factsheets/adap1.htm), up from US$204 million in 1996, the year that protease inhibitors first became available. In addition to these increases in funding, several cost-savings methods have been applied including use of a variety of pharmaceutical discount programs. Unfortunately, despite these increases in funding and cost savings measures, ADAP funding is insufficient to cover demand for medications. The result is that many states in the United States effectively ration medications to economically poor, uninsured people with HIV/AIDS by maintaining wait lists, limiting the total number of drugs a person with HIV/AIDS can receive, or restricting the formulary (not including all effective drugs on the formulary). As these restrictions increase, we could see a greater and greater disparity by income in the percentage of HIV-infected people receiving treatment and decreased survival among low-income populations due to them being less likely to receive treatment (McFarland et al., 2003) .",

For example, if the United States provided universal health insurance with drug coverage it would not be necessary to fund the medical care components of the Ryan White (CARE) program or the ADAP program. Instead all people with serious illness would have access to needed medications. Similarly, were the same support services available for disenfranchised populations or those who have to navigate a difficult treatment system, we would not need services only for people with HIV/AIDS. Instead I fear we will see AIDS exceptionalism end by no longer providing needed medical care or supportive services to people with HIV/AIDS or any of the populations struggling with poverty and serious illness.",
