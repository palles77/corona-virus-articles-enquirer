Waterborne diseases should not be seen as an independent part of the infectious disease cycle, but as a vehicle for their transmission. While we assume that a significant proportion of these gastrointestinal illnesses may be waterborne, we have no data to estimate the proportion of the overall burden of disease they represent (Figure 13 .1). In a holistic approach, a reduction of waterborne disease should also result in a measurable reduction of the overall rate of gastrointestinal illnesses (Mara and Cairncross, 1989) . This is the result of limiting person-to-person transmission and also the result of reducing the risk of the contamination of foods by contaminated water or individuals that have been infected through drinking water (Figure 13 .2).",

Others are just emerging as being implicated in diseases transmitted by the water route (LeChevallier et al., 1999a,b) . Urbanization, ageing of water treatment plants, increasing numbers of immunocompromised individuals and ageing populations are potential causes for an increased risk of waterborne infectious diseases (Ford and Colwell, 1996; Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001) . As we will see later, the endemic level of disease due to drinking-water consumption has also been shown to be quite significant and it contributes to maintaining these pathogens in the affected populations. The dilemma of balancing microbial and cancer health risks is also a difficult one to resolve, but it should not result in a reduction of treatment efficiency. The low risk level for cancer is insignificant when compared to the risk of waterborne infectious disease in absence of adequate water treatment (Payment and Hartemann, 1998; Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001) .",

In other countries, data gathering is often performed very poorly because of lack of resources to identify the water-related events as well as the lack of centralized data gathering official authorities (Andersson and Bohan, 2001) . Several methods for the detection and investigation of waterborne outbreaks have been described, but are still not widely used (Craun, 1990; Andersson and Bohan, 2001) as resources and funds are critically lacking, even in industrialized countries (Fewtrell and Bartram, 2001 ). An enormous effort is needed to educate all on the importance of water in the dissemination of disease. All levels of society, from consumer to politicians, must be educated to the necessity of improving water quality (Ford and Colwell, 1996) as a major step in improving the quality of life and health.",

Dozens of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have now been reported world-wide, but most are small compared to the explosive outbreak experienced in Milwaukee (USA) in the spring of 1993 (Edwards, 1993; Mackenzie et al., 1994) . Following what appears to be a failure in treatment, water that met the United States Environmental Protection Agency water quality guidelines may have caused gastrointestinal illnesses in over 400 000 people or one-third of the population of this city over a period of one month. Most of these illnesses were cryptosporidiosis, but many were probably of viral origin and the number of illnesses reported may have been overestimated by 100-fold (Hunter and Syed, 2001) . The most surprising aspect of this event is that cryptosporidiosis was probably occurring even before it was detected following a report from an inquisitive pharmacist (Morris et al., 1998) . This suggests that unless an effort is made to identify waterborne diseases they will remain undetected, buried in the endemic level of illness in the population (Payment and Hunter, 2001) .",

Even infectious disease specialists often forget that enteric microorganisms are associated with a wide range of symptoms and diseases (Table 13 .1). Protozoan parasites, such as amoebae, can cause severe liver or brain infections and contact lens wearers are warned of the dangers of eye infections. Bacteria can cause pneumonia (Legionella) and some are suggesting the possibility that Helicobacter pylori, which has been associated with gastric ulcers, could be transmitted by the water route. Among the 72 known enteroviruses, many can induce illnesses other than gastrointestinal, such as hepatitis (viral type A or E), poliomyelitis, viral meningitis, enteroviral carditis, epidemic myalgia, diabetes, ocular diseases. Some viruses can also induce abortions, stillbirth and fetal abnormalities (Payment, 1993a,b) .

(1981) prospectively studied the gastrointestinal illnesses associated with the consumption of tap water using reports from physicians, pharmacists and teachers. Their results were based on more than 200 distribution systems of treated or untreated water and they reported five epidemics (more than 1000 cases) associated with poor quality water. This study is typical of most studies which relied on the detection of epidemics to assess the level of water quality: they do not address the endemic level of gastrointestinal illnesses which may be due to low level contamination of the water. The same group, in a prospective follow-up study on 48 villages for 64 weeks, has evaluated the gastrointestinal illneses associated with untreated ground water and found a relationship between faecal streptococci and acute gastrointestinal disease (Ferley et al., 1986; Zmirou et al., 1987) . Faecal coliforms did not appear to be related to acute disease. Total coliforms and total bacteria had no independent contributions to disease but, even in the absence of all measured indicator germs, onefourth of the cases were still observed. In Israel, Fattal et al. (1988) addressed the health effects of both drinking water and aerosols. Their studies on kibbutz water quality and morbidity were performed in an area with relatively high endemicity of gastrointestinal disease and did not show a relationship between health effects and total or faecal coliforms. This study was, however, based only on morbidity reported to physicians, data that are considered to represent only 1% of the actual cases in a population.",

The estimated annual incidence of gastrointestinal illness was 0.76 among tap-water drinkers as compared with 0.50 among RO-filtered-water drinkers (P , 0.01). Because participants in the RO-filter group were still exposed to tap water (i.e. about 40% of their water intake was tap water), it was estimated that about 50% of the illnesses were probably tap water-related and preventable.

Raw water entering the plant was contaminated with parasites, viruses and bacteria at levels found throughout the world in faecally-contaminated waters. The water treatment plant produced water that met or exceeded current Canadian and US regulations for drinking-water quality. The distribution system was in compliance for coliforms but residual chlorine was not detectable at all times in all parts of the distribution system. The rates of highly credible gastrointestinal illnesses (HCGI) were within the expected range for this population at 0.66 episodes/person-year for all subjects and 0.84 for children 2 to 12 years old. The rate of illness was highest in autumn -winter and lowest in summer. Overall, there were more illnesses among tap-water consumers than among subjects in the purified (bottled) water group, suggesting a potential adverse effect originating from the plant or the distribution system. Children were consistently more affected than adults and up to 40% of their gastrointestinal illnesses were attributable to water. The rates of gastrointestinal illness among consumers of water obtained directly at the treatment plant were similar to the rate of illness among consumers of purified water. Two periods of increased tap-water-attributable illnesses were observed respectively in November 1993 and in March 1994. Subjects in the two bottled water groups (i.e. purified water and water obtained directly at the water treatment plant) still consumed about one-third of their drinking water as tap water. They were thus exposed to some tap water and its contaminants; as a result the risks due to tap water are underestimated.",

The authors looked for correlations between the number of children attending the emergency department at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) for gastroenteritis with the turbidity of treated water in the preceding 14 days. The 1.2 million people of Philadelphia receive their drinking water through three water treatment plants supplied by rivers considered to be 'highly contaminated'.
