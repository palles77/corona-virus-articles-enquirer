Although people at the extremes of age have a greater risk of complications, influenza has been more frequently investigated in the elderly than in children, and inpatients than outpatients. Yearly vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines is the main strategy to control influenza.

Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses showed that 91.6% belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, which is not included in trivalent vaccines. Conclusions: Influenza A and B are often detected in children and adolescents with ILI episodes, with similar and mild presentation in outpatients. The mismatch between the circulating influenza viruses and the trivalent vaccine offered in Brazil may have contributed to the high frequency of influenza A and B in this population.",

            "text": "Influenza (INF) A and B viruses are a frequent cause of respiratory tract infection in humans, affecting people of all ages with varied morbidity, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes. INF A viruses are divided into various subtypes based on the antigenic properties of surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. INF B viruses are not subdivided into subtypes, but two genetically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses, namely B/Yamagata lineage and B/Victoria lineage have circulated globally since 1985 and co-circulated since 2001. [1] [2] [3] People at the extremes of age are at increased risk of complications, hospitalization and influenza-associated death. The burden of influenza has long been recognized in the elderly due to the increased risk of death secondary to pneumonia or cardiac complications. 4 In young and very young children, studies have demonstrated that the burden of influenza-associated acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is also substantial. 5 A recent meta-analysis including 43 studies and data from approximately eight million children, estimated that 90 million new cases of influenza and 20 million cases of influenza-associated ALRI occurred worldwide in children younger than five years in 2008. 6 However, few studies have considered the burden of influenza A and B in the outpatient setting. 7 Seasonal influenza vaccination is the main strategy to prevent influenza and its complications. In Brazil, the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) is offered at no cost for individuals aged 60 years and over, children from six months to five years of age, pregnant and puerperal women (up to 45 days postpartum), health care workers, school teachers, indigenous populations, immunocompromised patients or with chronic conditions, adolescents and young adults aged 12-21 under socio-educational measures, and prisoners and prison staff. The quadrivalent vaccine (QIV), which includes also the B/Yamagata lineage is available only in private clinics. Influenza vaccination campaigns have been successful, with vaccine coverage above 70%. However, the impact of campaigns on reducing influenza burden is not well established since the information on the incidence and severity of influenza is limited. Data on the burden of influenza B in children and adolescents are even scarcer.",

However, this fact did not affect the expected number of influenza cases to be analyzed in the study. We observed a high frequency of influenza A and B in children and adolescents with fever and respira-tory symptoms. Among the 277 episodes of ILI, 99 (35.7%) were caused by influenza viruses, mostly influenza A (79.9%). The use of \"influenza-like illness\" as the case definition for respiratory sampling justifies this finding. Similar rates were found in a recently published study that detected 263 virologically confirmed episodes of influenza in 811 ILI episodes (36.7%), the majority also caused by influenza A viruses. 12 In three consecutive influenza seasons, other authors detected 48% of influenza in ILI episodes in children and adolescents aged five to 14 years, a similar age range of the present cohort. 13 Additionally, the use of robust diagnostic tests in multiplex platforms enhanced the likelihood of influenza diagnosis due to superior sensitivity of these new assays. 14 It is well established that INF A and INF B co-circulate annually. In the USA, the proportion of circulating INF A and INF B viruses has varied from 65% to 88% and from 12% to 35%, respectively, in the last 10 years. 15 [16] [17] [18] It is difficult to predict which influenza virus will predominate in a given season. In the southern hemisphere spring of 2017, a second wave of ILI related to influenza B infections was observed. Influenza surveillance data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health showed that in 2016 and 2017, influenza B viruses circulated with greater activity in spring months. As early as 2018, this trend did not remain. [16] [17] [18] In other countries, this second wave of INF B viruses were also observed in the season. 13 Concerning to the clinical findings, symptoms caused by influenza B virus were remarkably similar to those caused by influenza A virus, and included fever, headache, cough, somnolence, myalgia, abdominal pain, vomiting and conjunctivitis, as observed by other authors. 19, 20 We found a higher proportion of males among INF B infections, which also caused more prostration than INF A infections. Few studies have shown that male sex may predispose to respiratory virus infection. A recent observational study has shown a significant association between male sex and adenovirus infection, but not with influenza or other respiratory viruses. 21 Early beliefs were that influenza B viruses caused less severe disease than influenza A viruses. 22 Taking into account the hospitalization rates, morbidity or mortality of influenza viruses over the last decades, INF B infections are now considered less severe than those caused by A/H3N2 viruses, but more severe than A/H1N1 infections. 15, 19, 23 Both influenza A and B viruses may cause rare neurological complications such as encephalitis and Reye's syndrome, the latter more often associated with INF B infections. 19 From 2010 to 2018, the frequency of INF B infections associated with pediatric deaths varied from 15% to 37% in the USA. 15 In Brazil in 2017, 498 deaths of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were due to influenza viruses, the vast majority caused by influenza A(H3N2) (277 deaths, 55.6%) and influenza B (154 deaths, 30.9%). 17 Fortunately, in the present cohort no patient died or had severe influenza requiring hospitalization. Maybe individuals included in prospective cohort studies are more properly informed about the importance of early report of symptoms and advised to seek medical attention sooner than the general population.",

Seasonal influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza and its complications. 24 However, due to the changing nature of the influenza virus, influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) may vary over different influenza seasons and virus subtypes/lineages. A recent study conducted in the Netherlands from 2004 to 2014 showed that the adjusted IVE dropped from 40% when the vaccine (partially) matched the circulating viruses, to 20% in mismatched seasons. The authors also observed that IVE was particularly low when A(H3N2) was the predominant influenza virus subtype. 25 Concerning to influenza B lineages, a review of INF B infections conducted in 26 countries showed that a vaccine mismatch occurred in approximately 25% of the seasons. 26 In a mismatched season, IVE may be suboptimal against INF B, potentially increasing the burden of the disease. 2 In a recently published study, conducted in the state of Paran\u00e1, the authors observed that both B/Yam and B/Vic lineages co-circulated from to 2013 to 2016, with a frequency of 47% and 53%, respectively. 27 In Brazil, previous studies have demonstrated the mismatch between vaccine and circulating lineages of influenza B. 28 We observed a higher proportion of the B/Yamagata lineage circulating in the city of Araraquara during the study period. As this lineage was not included in the TIV provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, protection against INF B infections was certainly lower than expected.

Recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated that viruses of the B/Victoria lineage infect subjects at a relatively younger age than those of the B/Yamagata lineage. 29, 30 As both INF B lineages have been circulating since 2001, and it is widely recognized that the QIV vaccine offers better protection than the TIV, 19 it sounds paradoxical that to date there is no recommendation of preferential use of QIV over TIV.",
