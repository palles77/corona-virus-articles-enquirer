However, the present research has not made a tentative evaluation of it to justify further reform. This paper analyses the cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals in 31 provinces during the period from 2002 to 2011 and adopts a Bayesian stochastic frontier model taking account of the identified heterogeneity according to the background of Chinese medical system reform, including the coastal location, 3A class hospital proportion, public subsidies and medical insurance reforms. It finds that the public subsidies and medical insurance reforms have improved the cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals, while the coastal location and 3A class hospital proportion have decreased the cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals. Therefore, these results imply that it will be beneficial for Chinese medical system to optimize the fiscal subsidies of public hospitals, encourage the entrance of private hospitals, improve the medical insurance coverage and set up the pre-triage system.",

Due to the miracle of economic development after the reform and open-up policy since 1978, the health status and outcome has already been improved in China. According to the World Development Indicators (WDI), life expectancy in China increased from 66.5 years in 1978 to 73.5 years in 2011, and infant mortality rate decreased from 5.3% to 1.3% during the same period (World Bank, 2013) . However, the development of health care has long been lagging in China (Eggleston, 2012; Li, Dong, & Liu, 2014) . With the increasing demand on high-quality medical services, the medical care sector of China has still been blamed for the high fee and low accessibility of medical services after the market-orientated reform started from 1985 in this sector. It even has been regarded as a failure by some researchers in China (Eggleston, Ling, Qingyue, Lindelow, & Wagstaff, 2008; State Council DRC Research Project, 2005; Wagstaff, Yip, Lindelow, & Hsiao, 2009 ). At present, despite there is broad agreement on that the system needs reform, there is less agreement on the causes of the system's failure and the reforms necessary to improve it (Eggleston et al., 2008) . Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to make an overall evaluation for the passing reform and search for solutions to present challenges.",

According to these researches, the efficiency of Chinese hospitals varies from different provinces and different year. And the overall efficiency had slightly increased before 2008. However, all of them only use the non-parametric method, i.e. Data Envelop Analysis (DEA) to analyze the efficiency of Chinese hospitals. However, this method cannot handle the noise and outliers in the data, which may strongly influence the shape of the frontier. It also suffers from the inability to test statistically for goodness of fit or significance of variables included in the functions. Meanwhile, the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) can overcome these limitations, despite being criticized for requiring a predefined functional form in the estimation of the frontier. And Coelli, Prasada Rao, and Battese (1998) argue that SFA is more powerful than DEA in panel data applications as it can be used to measure the efficiency and technical change over time. Therefore, we use the SFA to overcome the inherent drawbacks of DEA and make a robust check.",

And small sample inference is carried out in the same way as if one had access to a large sample. The estimation is unbiased with respect to the sample size. However, quite a little literature on the 2 It is different from the traditional estimation method, i.e. maximum likelihood (ML). Moreover, other Partial frontier approaches, like the order-m (Cazals, Florens, & Simar, 2002) and alpha-frontiers (Aragon, Daouia, & Thomas-Agnan, 2005) , and StoNED-stochastic Non-Smooth Envelopment of Data (Kuosmanen, 2012) are also developed to cope with the limitations of DEA. hospital efficiency uses the Bayesian stochastic frontier (SF) model, except Koop, Osiewalski, and Steel (1997) . Following Tsionas (2002) and Assaf (2011) , we adopt the Bayesian SF model with random coefficients in this paper. Comparing with traditional SFA and DEA, the Bayesian SF model with random coefficients that capture the unobserved heterogeneity and is more close to the reality, which will assure the efficiency is correctly estimated for separating technical inefficiency from technological differences across hospitals. And Pereira de Souza, Diallo, Castro Souza, and Baidya (2010) analyze the 60 Brazilian electricity distribution utilities with DEA and Bayesian SF and conclude that the DEA results are vulnerable to outlier while the results under Bayesian SF are more credible. Therefore, we are motivated to adopt Bayesian SF model to analyze the efficiency of Chinese hospitals.",

(2012) use the Tobit model to analyze the effects of some factors on the efficiency of Chinese hospitals, including the coastal location, public subsidies, the social medical insurance reform, the ratio of third-class hospitals to total hospitals and etc. And they conclude that the former two have insignificant effect on improving the technical efficiency, while the latter two significantly promote the technical efficiency. However, they use the traditional DEA to estimate the efficiency score in the first step. Moreover, McDonald (2009) argues that the use of Tobit regression was considered inappropriate in the second stage of DEA. This was because technical efficiency is fraction data and not generated by a censoring process. Therefore, it still needs more rigorous research to act as robust check.",

The medical care system of China was characterized by \"prevention first\", community organization and cooperative financing (Hsiao, 1995) . Medical service was delivered through a three-tier organization system, the street (sub-district), district and municipal level hospitals in urban areas as well as the village health stations, township health centers and county hospitals in rural areas. There was also a three-tier health insurance system that consisted of publicly-funded medical care, labor insurance medical care and cooperative medical care schemes (Dong, 2001 (Dong, , 2009 ). The publiclyfunded medical care, which was also called Government Insurance Schemes, covers civil servant, employees of public enterprises, military offices and university students. And the labor insurance medical care covers workers in state-owned and collective companies. Moreover, the cooperative medical care schemes cover the rural population and collapsed in 1990s (Audibert et al., 2013) . In this period, the price of medical service was kept low by the Central Price Commission. People's needs for basic medical service had been satisfied, which helped to improve their health status (Hsiao, 1995) . However, the 10 years' Culture Revolution began in 1966. This undermined the medical care system. As the economic reform moved forward, the government put first priority on economic development when the local government was given more autonomy and competed for economic growth, rather than public services like medical care (Audibert et al., 2013; Dong, 2001) . As a result, the development of the medical care system was challenged by limited public funds and the rapid expansion of medical expenditures (Dong, 2009) .",

This gave existing hospitals more autonomy and raised the price of medical service, reducing the restrictions on the supply of medical service ). Meanwhile, the MOH of China also strengthened the quality of medical service through stipulating a regulation on hospital grading in late of 1989, namely certificating hospitals in China every three year in different grade according to their capacity to supply highquality medical service. Later in 1992, the MOH of China granted further substantial financial autonomy to hospitals, encouraging the hospitals to increase their revenue by offering higher quality service and allowing hospitals to transform to modern companies and set joint ventures. After these reforms, new hospitals began to spring up and the supply of medical service largely increased (World Bank, 2010). As the regulation and entry barriers, the number of private hospitals had not increased a lot until 2001 when the government abolished some limitations. And up to March 2013, there are 10166 private hospitals in China. 3 However, the public hospitals still maintain the dominant position in the healthcare sector of China (Gu & Zhang, 2006) . At the same time, China began market and commercialization reform in the medical care system. Negative externalities quickly began to emerge, including the poor access and high costs of medical service (Audibert et al., 2013; Eggleston et al., 2008) .",

The State Council implemented the pilot reform of basic social medical insurance scheme (BSMIS) for urban employees in Jiangsu and Jiangxi province. This was applied to the whole country in 1998. In 2003, the new rural cooperative medical system (NRCMS) was implemented in the four provinces by the State Council. Both BSMIS and NRCMS are different from the traditional medical care insurance before 1978. And there are individual responsibility of premium contribution and individual accounts in the new schemes. For more details, see Dong (2009) . In 2000, the State Council announced different policies for both for-profit and non-profit hospitals, lifting restrictions on public hospitals, separating pharmacies from medical practices. Before this reform, the hospitals always sold patients medicine at high price, so that to increase the revenue of hospitals and relieve the limits of low fiscal budgets on hospitals. This situation was also described as \"medicine-supportedhospitals\" in China. With the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes) in 2003 and the scandal of expenses in medical service, the MOH finally made a prudent review on the medical care system in China and admitted the low coverage of the medical insurance and the failure of market-orientation reform in medical care industry.",

            "text": "Hospital efficiency analysis is an important issue within the field of health economics. There are two contemporary approaches to measure cost efficiency of hospitals: the parametric approach and the non-parametric approach. The most used parametric method is SFA, while the popular non-parametric approach is DEA (Barros, de Menezes, Peypoch, Solonandrasana, & Vieira, 2008; Wei, Ni, & Sheng, 2011; Yu, Choi, & Zhang, 2013; Zhu, Wang, & Wu, 2014) . However, Tsionas (2002) and Assaf (2011) argue that these traditional methods have inherent limitations that assume that all hospitals operate under the same production or cost technology in the estimation of efficiency, while in practice this is not true and might lead to incorrect efficiency estimates. Battese and Rao (2002) have begun to use the metafrontier approach to take account of the different production technology when estimating the efficiency and productivity. And it has brought out a large strand of literature. However, this metafrontier approach has inherent deficiency that requires prior knowledge of different groups of the DMUs (Kumbhakar, Wang, & Horncastle, 2015) . Therefore, we adopt the Bayesian SF model with random coefficients that was introduced by Tsionas (2002). It assumes that each hospital is allowed different intercepts as well as slope coefficients. The main purpose of the model is to improve the accuracy in the efficiency estimation by separating the cost-efficiency estimates from heterogeneity among hospitals. This model is different from the Bayesian fixed frontier model, introduced by Koop et al. (1997) , which assumes that all hospitals share exactly the same production possibilities (i.e. no heterogeneity between hospitals). The Bayesian SF model with random coefficients is estimate through Bayesian method, which has an additional key advantage, in that the technique incorporates informative priors, so that prior knowledge, or results of a previous model, can be used to inform the current model (Greene, 2005; Orea & Kumbhakar, 2004) . In other words, it obeys the likelihood principle. And small sample inference is carried out in the same way as if one had access to a large sample, and all inferences follow logically from Bayes' theorem. Therefore, any sample size can be accommodated, no matter how small. The estimation is unbiased with respect to sample size. Moreover, Bayesian inference is consistent with much of the philosophy of science regarding epistemology, where knowledge cannot be built entirely through experimentation, but requires prior knowledge (Griffin & Steel, 2007; Koop et al., 1997) .",

Based on the literature survey and contextual setting of China, we further try to detect the influence of reform in the medical care system on hospital efficiency in different dimensions, i.e. we will examine the relationship between hospital technical efficiency and the following covariates: coastal location (Coastal), 3A class (San Ji Jia Deng) hospital proportion (Best), public subsidies (Subsidy), medical insurance reforms (Reform1) and (Reform2). The justification for the selection of these covariates is provided in the following subsections. Coastal location is a dummy variable that indicates whether the hospitals are located in a coastal province or a non-coastal province. 4 Costal location may have an effect on hospital efficiency. For example, Hu et al. (2012) found that there is no apparent efficiency difference between coastal and non-coastal provinces. However, Ng (2011) concludes that the hospitals in coastal provinces suffer from more productivity decline than the non-coastal provinces in China from 2002 to 2005. Reform was first initiated in coastal provinces of China, which may enhance the management and incentives in the medical care industry through deregulation. Moreover, the eastern area, i.e. coastal provinces, is richer and more developed than western and central area of China (Jian et al., 1996) . The more favorable environment and diversified medical demand of people will drive the hospitals to be more efficient.",

And this is different from the viewpoints of some scholars that negated the positive effects of the medical reform in the last thirty years (State Council DRC Research Project, 2005) . Meanwhile, it does not flatter that the past medical reform is totally a big success for the negative influences on the cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals. It concludes that raising the subsidy to the hospital and increasing the coverage of social medical insurance both will promote the cost efficiency, while the coastal location and raising the proportion of 3A hospitals both have positive influence on increasing the costs. Based on the analysis and discussion in Part IV, the policy implications are derived as follows:",

However, the government subsidies have decreased as a share of total hospital revenues for more than 20 years and now account for about 10 percent of total revenues (World Bank, 2010) . Hence, it is reasonable to encourage the development of private hospitals to ease the pressure of decreasing fiscal subsidies in public hospitals. The result for the variable \"Coastal\" also indicates the significance to deregulate the private hospitals.",

However, the coverage of medical services should be also enlarged, especially for the treatment of critical diseases as well as the essential drugs. Meanwhile, the medical insurance for the rural and urban should be unified an integrated to offer people equal insurance for basic medical service. According to the results, the introduction of the new rural cooperative medical system (NRCMS) has brought out more significant improvement in efficiency of Chinese hospitals than the basic social medical insurance scheme (BSMIS) for urban employees. The present medical insurance in China is in a high degree of fragmentation for different provinces or counties.",
