MO3.13 cells were shown to be highly susceptible to MV infection and virus budding was observed from the surface of infected MO3.13 cells by EM. Analysis of the infection in real time and by immunocytochemistry revealed that virus spread occurred by cell-to-cell fusion and was also facilitated by virus transport in cell processes. MO3.13 cells were shown to express CD46, a MV receptor, but were negative for the recently discovered MV receptor, signaling leucocyte activation molecule (SLAM). Immunohistochemical studies on SSPE tissue sections demonstrated that CD46 was also expressed on populations of human oligodendrocytes. SLAM expression was not detected on oligodendrocytes. These studies, which are the rst to show MV infection of human oligodendrocytes in culture, show that the cells are highly susceptible to MV infection and this model cell line has been used to further our understanding of MV spread in the CNS.

Both diseases are characterize d by infection of neurons and glial cells after incubation periods ranging from months, MIBE, to years, SSPE, following the primary infection. As yet, the site of viral persistence within the body remains unknown (Rima et al, 1995) . Restrictions of viral gene expression have been demonstrated in brain tissues from patients with both diseases affecting the genes encoding the matrix, fusion, and haemagglutinin proteins (Baczko et al, 1986; Cattaneo et al, 1988; Billeter and Cattaneo, 1991;  ter Meulen, 1997) .

Viral antigen is detected within both the nuclei and cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes in SSPE brain tissue (Allen et al, 1996) . Although the infection is widespread in the hemispheric white matter, relatively low numbers of infected oligodendrocytes are observed in the brain stem and spinal cord. Astrocytes are also infected throughout the CNS but to a much lesser degree. The virus is distributed throughout the CNS, from the temporal and frontal cortices, to the medulla, pons, and cervical spinal cord regions. In some cases low numbers of antigen positive neurons have been observed in the cerebellum (Allen et al, 1996) . Such studies have suggested transynaptic spread of the virus in a cephalo-caudal direction. Observations using the differentiated human neuron cell line, NT2, have given support to the hypothesis of transynaptic spread (Lawrence et al, 2000) but as yet the mechanism has not been elucidated. It is also unclear how the neurons or oligodendrocytes initially become infected or how the infection is propagated through the white matter.",

Cultured human astrocytoma cells have intimately associated extended cell processes that are utilized by MV in the infection of surrounding cells (Duprex et al, 1999) . Studies have also shown that cultured human neurons can become infected via the extended processes that are in contact with more readily infected neuroepithelial cells in mixed cell populations (McQuaid et al, 1998) . Such a mechanism may be due to the presence of virus proteins in the neuroepithelial cell plasma membrane where it contacts the neurons. Furthermore, it has also been shown that viral spread in cultured neurons occurs in the absence of syncytium formation and with minimal extracellular virus production (Lawrence et al, 2000) .",

Studies on glial cell lines have indicated that, in contrast to nonneural cells, MV transcription can be down-regulated by intrinsic host cell factors, whereas the differentiatio n state of the cells in uences the translation of virus proteins (Schneider-Schaulie s et al, 1993) . Despite these investigations there are very few studies that have utilized either primary cells or oligodendrocyte cell lines to study MV infection in this important cell type. In one previous report, Atkins et al (1991) reported that a nonrodent-adapted strain of Edmonston strain of MV multiplied and produced a cytopathic effect in primary cultures of rat oligodendrocytes (Atkins et al, 1991) . Viral infection in that study was only monitored by cytopathic effects and no viral immunocytochemistry or ultrastructural investigations were undertaken.",

MO3.13 is an immortal human-human hybrid derived by lectin-enhanced , polyethylene glycol-mediated somatic cell fusion between the thioguanine-resistan t rhabdomyosarcoma mutant RD-TG.6 and primary human oligodendrocytes obtained from cultures of adult temporal lobectomies (Talbot et al, 1993; Ursell et al, 1995) . MO3.13 cells are characterize d as being positive by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting for the oligodendrocyte speci c markers myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP) . The OLN-93 cell line was established from primary cultures of glial cells prepared from the brains of 1-day-old Wistar rats (Richter-Landsberg and Heinrich, 1996) . In some recently published studies (Duprex et al, 1999 (Duprex et al, , 2000 , we have come to appreciate the usefulness of a recombinant MV, which expresses enhanced green uorescence protein (EGFP). This virus was therefore chosen to examine oligodendrocyte cell infection and virus spread from cell-to-cell . The MO3.13 cell line was also analyzed for expression of a receptor used by vaccine strains of MV, CD46 (Naniche et al, 1993 ) and for another recently described MV receptor SLAM (Tatsuo et al, 2000) . In parallel investigations snap-frozen blocks of white matter from an autopsy case of SSPE were examined for the expression of CD46 and SLAM by immunocytochemistry.",

This is the rst report of MV infection of a human oligodendrocyte cell line, an important cell type known to be infected in SSPE. The cells are readily infectible by a recombinant MV and infectious virus was produced. By comparison, the rodent oligodendrocyte cell line, OLN-93 displayed a low susceptibility to MVeGFP infection and infectious virus was not released. MO3.13 cells expressed high levels of cell surface CD46 but were negative for the recently described MV receptor SLAM. This is consistent with the observation in SSPE tissue sections where CD46 but not SLAM expression was detected on oligodendrocytes in the white matter. However, the numbers of CD46-positive oligodendrocytes detected by immunohistochemistry was only a small percentage of the total number of oligodendrocytes in the white matter of the brain areas examined. A more detailed description of CD46 and SLAM expression in the normal and MV-infected CNS and peripheral tissues is currently in preparation (McQuaid et al, unpublished results) . It has been shown that not all cells that are susceptible to MV infection express detectable levels of CD46 (Yanagi et al, 1994; Dunster et al, 1995; Horvat et al, 1996) , and SLAM is only constitutively expressed on immature thymocytes, CD45RO high memory T cells, and a proportion of B cells (Sidorenko and Clarke, 1993; Cocks et al, 1995) . The mechanism of MV entry into these cells remains unclear and would seem to indicate that other MV receptors may exist on mammalian cells.",

Individual infected cells, identi ed by EGFP auto uoresence, were monitored by CSLM and the virus spread was shown to be cell process-mediated with a rapid progression of GFP from cell-to-cell . Utilizing this technique, MO3.13-propagated MVeGFP virus was observed to spread in MO3.13 cell monolayers. Virus propagation through the monolayer was observed to be predominantly a cell processmediated event. The actual mechanism of virus spread from an infected cell process to an adjacent uninfected cell process has not been established in these studies. It is possible that microfusion of cell processes occur with the accompanying passage of viral ribonucleoprotein into an uninfected cell process. However, infected cells were also observed to spread infection by cell body-to-cell body fusion. Adjacent cells become infected and then fuse to form syncytia. These observations have previously been made in MVeGFP-infected murine neuroblastoma cells where virus spreads from cell-to-cel l both by fusion and via cell processes (Duprex et al, 2000) .",

These mature virions have surface projections, thickened envelope membranes, and the nucleocapsid tubules are observed to be dispersed peripherally in a spiral form (Macintyre and Armstrong, 1976) . Electron microscopy of undifferentiated and differentiated NT2 cells showed that viral budding occurred very rarely in undifferentiated cells and was not observed on the surface of differentiate d NT2 cells (McQuaid et al, 1998; Lawrence et al, 2000) . However, nucleocapsids were aligned at the cell membrane of differentiate d NT2 cells, in neuronal processes and at presynaptic neuronal membranes. Ultrastructural analysis of MV-infected MO3.13 cells revealed an abundance of MV nucleocapsid within the cytoplasm, both in isolation and as aggregates .

The processes, which link the oligodendrocyte cell body to the sheath, are narrow and tortuous (Knobler et al, 1974) . The paranodal regions of oligodendrocyte can also contact other glial cells of the CNS such as astrocyte by gap junctions, indicating functional coupling (Berry et al, 1995) . Gap junctions establish intracellular channels of communication through which ions and small solutes (<1300 D) can pass (Mugnaini, 1982) . However, it is unlikely that viral nucleocapsid could pass from cell-to-cel l via intact gap junctions. Occasionally interfasicular oligodendrocytes may be seen aligned in rows. Where this occurs, the cell membranes of adjacent cells are in intimate contact but lack speci c junctional contacts. In very rare examples, in the white matter from cases of SSPE, chains of interfasicular oligodendrocytes were demonstrated to have detectable levels of MV. However, in such autopsy tissue, xed for light microscopy, it is impossible to determine if virus is present in the very ne oligodendrocyte processes in the white matter. Oligodendrocytes also occur in the gray matter as perineuronal satellite cells. Individual satellite cells are thought to be in close contact with single neurons. In some pathological situations, such cells have been described to have processes extending to myelin sheaths (Ludwin, 1979) . The extent of oligodendrocyte processes in the CNS and the ndings, in the present study, of extensive infection of oligodendrocyte processes in vitro raises the possibility of oligodendrocyte-to-neuro n infection in the CNS as a means of initiating spread of virus throughout the CNS. It is postulated that, once present in neurons, MV can spread transneuronally throughout the CNS (Allen et al, 1996; Lawrence et al, 2000) , possibly by fast axonal transport (Oldstone et al, 1999) .",
