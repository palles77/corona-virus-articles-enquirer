Sera from 29 cats in colonies with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and known to contain TGEV-neutralizing antibody, were found to have titres 12.3 fold higher against CCV.

Homologous and heterologous VN titres in antisera to known viruses were then compared with titres in sera from populations of dogs and cats, in which the agent responsible for antibody development was unknown. The objective of this work was to determine the feasibility of serological distinction between possible TGEV infection and CCV or FIPV infection of dogs or cats respectively. This distinction would be important in any epidemiological investigation of the role of dogs and cats in TGEV outbreaks, using serology alone, since both species would be expected to possess antibody to their own respective viruses.",

Titres of the sera prepared against each agent were higher in homologous than in heterologous neutralization tests. Similarly antiserum to TGEV surface projections neutralized CCV, but only to low titre. Thus, whilst the antigenic relationship detected by virus neutralization resides within the polypeptide of the surface projection, the difference in titres suggests that VN antibodies in animal sera due to TGEV or CCV could be distinguished. Experimental infection of cats with TGEV resulted in VN antibodies with little or no activity for CCV (Table II) or FIPV (Reynolds and Garwes, 1979) . However, coronavirus antibody in FIPV-infected cats neutralized CCV more effectively than TGEV. The origin of TGEV VN antibody in British cats is still unexplained. It may result horn infection and antigenic stimulation with CCV or FIPV but the results included in this paper indicate that TGEV infection itself cannot be incriminated. The potential for CCV to infect cats in quite unknown.",

The absence of a British isolate of CCV has prevented previous serological studies on the origin of this antibody. As TGEV can infect puppies, the possibility has existed that VN antibodies in canine sera were due to infection of dogs with TGEV (McClurkin et al., 1970) . Comparison of CCV and TGEV antibody titres in canine sera and sera from pigs immunized with TGEV, however, revealed a significant difference between the two populations ( Fig. 1) . Thus the TGEV titres observed in dogs may have been the result of cross-neutralization with CCV, due to common external antigens.

Biochemically, CCV and TGEV showed close similarities but with reproducible differences in the polypeptide patterns (Garwes and Reynolds, 1980) . Failure of BCV and HEV antisera to neutralize CCV or TGEV was expected as these agents were unrelated by previous immunofluorescence tests (Pedersen et al., 1978) . In that study, fluorescein-labelled 229E antiserum reacted with TGEV but not with CCV-infected cells, but the 229E antiserum used in this work failed to neutralize either CCV or TGEV. Fluorescein-labelled IBV antisera did not react with cells infected with CCV or TGEV (D.J. Reynolds, unpublished results, 1979) or neutralize these viruses.",
