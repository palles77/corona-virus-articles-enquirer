Preferred terms for nonproliferative and proliferative lesions are presented for each tissue. Spontaneous and aging lesions, as appropriate, as well as lesions induced by exposure to test materials, are included. Although some diagnoses have synonyms provided, these terms may not be appropriate as histologic diagnoses in toxicity studies (i.e., coloboma and synechia).

Cornea should be free of clefts or folds, and corneal endothelial cells should not be vacuolated. Shattering or vacuolation of the lens should be avoided, and the lens should be correctly oriented in the globe, with the epithelium facing the cornea. Artifactual retinal separation or vacuolation is a common problem, and evaluation of photoreceptors demands sections no greater than 5 \u00b5m in thickness. Specialized ocular studies may require a different sectioning protocol, depending on the route of administration (systemic, topical intravitreal, sub-Tenon), the nature of the test article (aqueous solution, viscous depot, slowrelease capsule, stem cells, subretinal device), or as a result of unusual ophthalmoscopic findings. Pathologists should be involved in determining the best protocol for a particular study.",

The optic nerve should be transected at the level of the orbit to maximize the available nerve tissue. Extraocular tissues, including glands, should be trimmed off the globe prior to fixation to optimize the fixation of the retina and avoid separation; this also allows better visualization of the landmarks for subsequent trimming. Incision of the globe prior to fixation will compromise the architecture of the retina due to the reduced pressure inside the globe. Similarly, injection of fixative into the globe is not recommended, and is not necessary for rodent eyes. If orientation is critical, consider using tissue marking fluid or a suture to identify landmarks or the 12 o'clock position at time of collection, as landmarks are more difficult to see in a fixed globe. Left and right eyes should be clearly differentiated to allow correlation with clinical findings.",

This fixative tends to cause distortion of the globe due to osmolality effects, but generally gives good corneal, lens and retinal morphology.

The metabolic needs of the peripheral cornea are met by arterioles from this source, which form an arcade, and by diffusion of nutrients from the aqueous humor. Capillaries may extend as far anteriorly as Bowman's membrane (see below) before looping back, or less commonly, terminate abruptly within the peripheral stroma. The avascularity of the cornea is maintained through the activity of cytokines that inhibit angiogenesis such as endostatin and thrombospondins 1 and 2, VEGFR 1 and 3 inhibitors, and tissue inhibitors of metaloproteinases, which have been identified in the cornea and are believed to prevent the encroachment of vessels beyond the limbus (Cursiefen et al. 2006) .",

In rodents, the corneal epithelium makes up approximately 30% (in contrast to other species, including humans, where the epithelium is approximately 10%) of the total corneal thickness (Henriksson et al. 2009 ). The epithelium is arranged in three distinct layers: superficial layer of flattened non-keratinized squamous cells; middle layer of polyhedral wing cells; and basal cells. The epithelium of the rodent cornea undergoes post-natal development and cell differentiation, with 1-2 cell layers present at birth, to 4-5 cell layers at eyelid opening, to 6-7 layers in the adult (Chung et al. 1992) , although some sources put the upper limits at the central cornea closer to thirteen layers (Henriksson et al. 2009 ). Epithelial cells appear to derive from the basal cells of the entire cornea during early development (Chung et al. 1992; Zieske 2004) . Following maturation stem cells are localized to the limbus similar to other species and are the source of epithelial cell replenishment during cell turnover, which is continuous, or recruitment following corneal injury. The integrity and function of the cornea are dependent on the division of epithelial stem cells, and the amplification and centripetal migration of the daughter cells into the cornea to populate the basal epithelium (Secker and Daniels 2009) . As the cells differentiate they move horizontally towards the surface, becoming first, polyhedral suprabasal wing cells, and second, flat squamous cells at the surface, where they eventually (induced by blinking) desquamate into the tear film. The superficial squamous cells have microvilli that function to increase the cell surface and promote tear adherence (Secker and Daniels 2009) .",

The source of the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) is derived from the keratocytes residing between the fibrils; these are modified fibroblasts with numerous interconnecting lamellapodia arranged parallel to the collagen bundles in a manner that similarly facilitates light transmission (Hassell and Birk 2010) . Keratocytes contain crystalline proteins that have properties that also reduce light scattering (Quantock and Young 2008) . During embryonic development, ECM is produced at a higher rate in the central portion of the corneal stroma relative to the periphery, contributing to the curvature of the cornea. The curvature is maintained by an annulus of collagen fibers that circumferentially align the limbus. The refracting power of the cornea is dependent on the curvature of the radius of the exterior surface, which is shaped to focus an image on the visual axis.",

The anterior side adjacent to the stroma is present at birth; however, the endothelial cells continue to secrete the lamina throughout life such that the membrane becomes thicker with age. Descemet's membrane gradually terminates just anterior to the trabecular meshwork, although in some mice strains there is a focal thickening that is suggestive of Schwalbe's line (Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002a; Smith, Sundberg, and John 2002b) . The endothelial cells (posterior epithelium) form a monolayer layer of cells that line the posterior aspect of the cornea. Cornea endothelial cells have incomplete tight junctions between cells that are permissive for movement of nutrients and other molecules from the aqueous humor into the avascular stroma. Optical clarity is achieved through active transport of fluid and ions out of the cornea to maintain a relatively dehydrated state (stromal deturgescence) through pumps and pinocytotic vesicles, and collectively, the system is referred to as a pump-leak mechanism (Bourne 2003) . Proliferation of the cornea endothelial cells continues until the time of eyelid opening, whereupon they become quiescent (Zieske 2004 ). In the rat and rabbit, it has been demonstrated that there is a reserve of endothelial cells in the peripheral cornea/limbus that are capable of replenishing the cornea endothelium postinjury (Bredow et al. 2014; Choi et al. 2015) .",

The choroid and ciliary body attach to the internal surface of the sclera, while the iris arises from the anterior portion of the ciliary body. The iris extends centrally to form a circumferential diaphragm in front of the lens and modulates light penetrance by contraction of myoepithelial cells (sympathetic innervation) and smooth muscle fibers (parasympathetic innervation) that permit dilation, and constriction, respectively. Anterior ocular immune deviation (\"privilege\") is established though the blood-ocular barrier (BOB), which consists of the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier. The blood-aqueous barrier consists of tight junctions between nonpigmented epithelium in the ciliary processes, the endothelial cells of the iris vasculature, and the inner wall endothelium of the angular aqueous plexus in non-primate mammals (akin to Schlemm's canal in primates) (Coca-Prados 2014) . The blood-retinal barrier is composed of non-fenestrated capillaries of the retinal circulation (inner blood-retinal barrier) and tight-junctions between retinal (pigmented) epithelial cells (outer blood-retinal barrier) preventing passage of large molecules from the choriocapillaris into the retina.",

The iris is divided into the anterior border layer, the stroma and sphincter inner layer, and the posterior pigmented epithelial layers which are continuous with the epithelium of the ciliary body (Ramos, Attar et al. 2017; Samuelson 2007) . The anterior border is formed by a discontinuous band of fibroblasts and melanocytes. The stroma is loosely arranged and composed of collagen fibrils, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and a network of nerve fibers and blood vessels. The smooth muscles of the iris control pupil diameter. The sphincter muscle is composed of bundles of smooth muscle that encircle the pupil and is under parasympathetic innervation associated with constriction of the pupil. The dilator muscle is composed of myoepithelial cells that extend radially from the iris sphincter muscle to the iris periphery in the posterior iris stroma in a spoke-like arrangement; it is under sympathetic innervation associated with pupil dilation. Pupil size and shape vary between species and state of contraction. The pupil is generally round in the rodent. The major arterial circle of the iris is furnished by anastomoses of the anterior ciliary arteries and the long posterior arteries (Riordan-Eva 2011) . Stromal blood vessels are relatively thick, and allow for constant blood flow regardless of pupil constriction or dilation (Barskey 2006) . Resident macrophages and dendritic cells grant immune privilege to ocular tissues of the anterior segment by modulating inflammatory reactions and establishing a deviated immune response (anterior chamberassociated immune deviation; ACAID), rather than stimulating a T-cell response that elicits delayed hypersensitivity or compliment-fixing antibodies. Deviated T-cell responses, the blood-aqueous-barrier, and immunosuppressive factors present in the aqueous collectively promote a microenvironment that spares the visual axis by minimizing inflammation in the anterior chamber that would otherwise cause potential damage to delicate ocular structures (Streilein 2003; Taylor 2009; Taylor and Kaplan 2010) . The color of the iris is attributed to type and density of melanin pigment, degree of vascularization, and backscatter of incident light from stromal collagen fibers. The latter accounts for the bluish pink iris color of albino rodent species (Wilkerson et al. 1996) . Pigmentation of the iris has a protective role to the retina by limiting light transmission through the pupil.",

Lens epithelial cells form a monolayer sheath on the anterior surface, and secrete an extracellular protein matrix forming a capsule that surrounds the cellular elements. Posterior lens fibers are elongated, transparent, fully differentiated cells that derive from progenitor epithelial cells. Cell proliferation is restricted to progenitor epithelial cells located in the germinative layer above the lens equator (nuclear bow). Under the influence of fibroblast growth factors, progeny cells migrate, or shift posterior to the equator, where they differentiate into fiber cells. As the cells differentiate, they undergo bi-directional elongation and produce massive quantities of crystalline proteins that are arranged in complex matrices along thin filaments that compose the cytoskeleton of the fiber cell (Zampighi et al. 2011) . Crytallines have a critical role in maintaining lens transparency and refractive properties. Injury to the lens may result in the formation of insoluble aggregates of crystallines, producing opacities (correlating to ophthalmically observable cataracts) that obstruct light transmission and obscure vision. As elongation progresses, the fibers become convex, and the apical tips migrate towards the anterior pole. The lens increases in size and weight as more fibers are successively incorporated into layers to form the lens mass. Older fibers (primary fibers) form the embryonic nucleus of the lens while the newer (secondary) fibers form the outer layers. Lens fibers subsequently undergo organelle degradation including nuclear loss (Dawes et al. 2014; Song et al. 2014) .",

Except for collagen and proteoglycans, the composition of the vitreous is similar to aqueous humor, and similarly is produced by the ciliary processes (Teixeira and Dubielzig 2013a) , although other ocular cells (hyalocytes, M\u00fcller cells, cells of the hyaloid vessels) have been ascribed a role (Kingston et. al., 2014) . Most of the soluble protein present in the vitreous is derived from plasma, and albumin and immunoglobulins represent ~80% of the protein content of the vitreous (Bishop 2014) . Studies utilizing fixation and dye injection demonstrate similarity in vitreous structure between human, non-human primate, and rabbit, and likely other species (Los 2008; Worst and Los 1992) . Therefore, a generalized presentation of the vitreous is provided and pertains to all species.",

The maintenance of the spatial configuration between fibrils by the remaining macromolecules imparts this critical function. \u2022 Maintaining the shape of the vitreous chamber and posterior cavity, and overall shape of the ocular globe. \u2022 Maintaining the normal positions of the lens and the retina. Differential distribution of collagen and proteoglycans results in two basic zones (cortical and medullary) with variable densities within the vitreous. The cortical vitreous occupies the periphery of the vitreous and encases the core (medullary vitreous). The cortical vitreous is relatively more condensed and fibrillar compared to the medullary vitreous, and has the appearance of a smooth clear membrane due to the lamellar distribution of collagen fibrils and associated highly polymerized proteoglycans (primarily chondroitin sulfate). Although the cortical vitreous represents only 2% of the total vitreous volume, it is the metabolic center of the vitreous body, because it contains the hyalocytes (detailed below), which make up 90% of the cell population in the cortical vitreous; fibrocytes and glial cells make up the remaining 10%. The vitreous cortex extends anteriorly from the vitreous base to form the anterior vitreous cortex and posteriorly to form the posterior vitreous cortex. The vitreous body interfaces with a number of ocular structures through the vitreous cortex. The anterior vitreous cortex forms the posterior limits of the posterior chamber and functions in the physiologic communication between the vitreous cavity and the aqueous humor. The anterior surface of the vitreous body extends anterior and medially from the pars plana at the ora ciliaris to contact the lens posterior to the lens equator. Thus, the anterior vitreous cortex is in contact with the ciliary processes and the lens zonules, as well as the posterior lens capsule. The vitreous attaches to the lens capsule in a ring-like manner, forming the ligament of Wieger (Sebag 1992) . Posterior to the ora ciliaris, bundles of vitreous fibrils attach to the internal limiting laminae (ILL) (Balazs et al. 1964) . Cords of vitreous collagen insert into gaps between the neuroglia. The cortical vitreous is most firmly attached to the ILL in the area of the optic disc, the macula (in primates), and to retinal blood vessels. Retinal pathology such as neovascularization or vascular malformations occurs in the areas of vitreous attachment to the retina. Separation of the vitreous may transmit traction to these attachments, leading to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal tears. Persistent vitreous traction on retinal tears is an important factor in the development of a retinal detachment.",

The region of cone concentration is usually referred to as the area centralis or visual streak, depending on its shape. In human, non-human primates and in some birds, the cone-enriched area is near the center of the retina and called the macula from its pigmented appearance. At its center is the fovea, a conedominated avascular region of maximal visual acuity. The rodent does not have a specialized region for visual acuity and has a much lower proportion of cones in its retina (Zeiss 2010) . Diurnal rodents have a relatively high concentration of cones (30-40%), but cones are sparse in nocturnal rodents (Bobu et al. 2008; Sa\u00efdi et al. 2011) . Rodents may have blue, blue/green, or green/red hybrid cones with some variable regional distribution in different species (Peichl 2005) . Some mice have a preponderance of blue cones in the ventral retina, but no spe-cialized areas such as a macula, fovea, area centralis, or visual streak is present.",

Bipolar cells have two processes that separately extend inward and outward connecting to ganglion cells and photoreceptors. Bipolar cells receive synaptic input from either rods (rod bipolars) or cones (cone bipolars) and transmit signals to ganglion cells. Horizontal cells are less frequent and often lie in the outer part of INL. These GABAergic inhibitory interneurons help integrate and regulate the input from multiple photoreceptor cells, optimizing vision under both bright and dim light conditions. Amacrine cells are numerous and often lie in the inner aspect of the INL. These are also inhibitory interneurons that interact with bipolar cells and ganglion cells to regulate neuronal impulses allowing one area of the retina to influence the activity of another. M\u00fcller cells are specialized glial cells that provide structural and functional support to the retina. These cells also maintain the stability of the retinal extracellular environment through the uptake of neurotransmitters, removal of cellular debris, and storage of glycogen for energy. Their nuclei are located in the INL and their long processes stretch radially across the thickness of the retina contacting the outer and inner limiting membranes. M\u00fcller cells have a close spatial relationship to pericytes of the retinal blood vessels and contribute to the maintenance of the blood-retinal barrier. Cells in the INL can be quantified and identified by special stains (Jeon et al. 1998) .",

The optic nerve is composed primarily of the axons from ganglion cells (GC), which extend from the inner retina, traversing posteriorly and centripetally within the inner nerve fiber layer to converge into bundles at the optic disc forming the nerve. The central area of the optic disc is depressed (meniscus of Kuhnt), and is supported by a thickening of the retinal inner limiting membrane. Ganglion cell axons and axon bundles are surrounded by astrocytes at the surface of the optic disc. As the nerve passes through the scleral canal it crosses an open meshwork of collagenous beams or plates continuous with the sclera (termed the lamina cribrosa). This connective tissue meshwork also contains elastin and lends support for the nerve tissue. The lamina cribosa is composed of sparse connective tissue in both rats and mice, and is less distinct compared to other laboratory species (Greaves 2000; Rubin 1974) . In most species including rodents, the axons are myelinated distal to the lamina cribrosa, so that on funduscopy, the optic disc is poorly demarcated from the surrounding tissue, and thus does not have a white appearance. In pigmented rats the optic disc may appear gray. Myelination is provided by the cell processes of oligodendroglia, which form sheaths around the ganglion cell axons. Myelin in the optic nerve stains positive with Luxol fast blue stain (LFB).",

The RPE and retina originate from different portions of the optic vesicle during embryonic development and are attached by an extracellular matrix specialized to enable interaction between the RPE and POS. Retinal disease or toxicological insult may result in loss of adhesion between the retina and RPE, resulting in retinal detachment and formation of a subretinal space (Mecklenburg and Schraermeyer 2007) . Pathological retinal detachment must be differentiated from artifact detachment, which is readily induced during processing of ocular tissues. RPE has critical roles in the support and viability of the photoreceptors with functions that include absorption of stray light, adhesion of the sensory retina to the choroid, secretion of growth factors, maintenance of the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), photoreceptor membrane turnover, and retinoid metabolism (Bok 1993; Marmor 1998) . The apical membrane of RPE cells have numerous, long microvilli that interdigitate with the outer segments of the photoreceptors, allowing for efficient turnover of discs as they are shed from the photoreceptors. The accumulation of inclusion bodies (see lysosomal accumulations, below) containing photoreceptor outer segment membranes can be observed in aging RPE and are associated with RPE degeneration that can lead to blindness (Marmor 1998) . The basal membrane of the RPE has large infoldings and an association with Bruch's membrane. Tight junctions between RPE form an important component of the blood retinal barrier (BRB) necessary for the maintenance of immune deviation in the posterior segment of the eye. They also prevent leakage of blood constituents from the choriocapillaris, and create osmotic pressure that assists in drawing fluid out of the retina through cellular mechanisms. Transcellular movement of glucose, retinol, amino acids and other nutrients into the retina, and that of metabolic wastes out, is regulated by receptors, ion channels and exchangers, and cytoplasmic organelles. These have a polar distribution in RPE, and the regulated movement of ions through the cell and IPM creates ionic gradients that maintain photoreceptor excitability and permits electrical transmission of light stimulus (Hughs 1998) .",

Melanin enhances object discrimination in bright light conditions by absorbing scattered light. In rodents, melanosomes tend to be rounder and fewer in number commensurate with the low-light conditions of their visual needs. Albino species have melanosomes, but lack melanin granules. Melanin tends to diminish and fuse with lipofuscin in RPE with aging. Some pharmacological agents, particularly substances with cationic properties (Boulton 1988) bind to melanin and induce pigmentary changes that may be observed on fundic examination. Melanin binding can unintentionally result in drug sequestration, prolonged drug exposure to sensitive ocular tissues, enhance free-radical injury, and can cause retinal toxicity through impaired RPE function. Age-related changes in melanin content, lipofuscin accumulation, and the formation of conjugates (melanolipofuscin) impairs light absorption, enhances oxidative stress, and results in RPE degeneration.",

The sclera merges with the surrounding dura mater posteriorly and is penetrated by the optic nerve at the posterior margins of the globe. The sclera has roles in protecting the eye from injury, maintaining ocular shape and IOP during movement of the eye, and in aiding visual acuity while reducing back-scatter from light. The sclera is covered by a fibroelastic membrane, the Tenon capsule, which forms a sleeve around the attachment of the ocular muscles to the sclera. The Tenon capsule fuses with the conjunctiva posterior to the limbus, and extends posterior to fuse with connective tissue surrounding the optic nerve. The sub-Tenon space is a site that can be potentially exploited in some species for drug administration. The rat does have a Tenon, however in the mouse it is poorly defined.",

Glaucoma is more commonly observed spontaneously in larger species, but can be induced experimentally in rodents. The trabecular meshwork is scant in rodents and spontaneous collapse apparently is rare. However, iridal-cornea adhesion can block the outflow of aqueous humor to a degree that the filtration angle collapses on itself. Following laser photocoagulation, the iris may scar to the angle over the meshwork (iridal-trabecular adhesion), and hyphema of the anterior chamber or atrophy of the ciliary body may occur (Levkovitch-Verbin, Quigley et al. 2002) . Collapse of the trabecular meshwork may be experimentally induced in animal glaucoma models (i.e. laser photocoagulation) (Ueda, Sawaguchi et al. 1998 , Levkovitch-Verbin, Quigley et al. 2002 . Substances such as cells (red blood cells and leukocytes), free pigment, melanocytes or macrophages containing pigment, or test material that has been administered into the aqueous or vitreous humour may become lodged within the meshwork and impede aqueous flow.

            "text": "Outer retinal atrophy or degeneration is a broad term that indicates loss of photoreceptors from a variety of causes that include hereditary, aging, toxicity, phototoxicity, nutritional deficiencies, retinal detachment, and inflammation. Photoreceptors have high metabolic demands, and thus are susceptible to toxins that interfere with energy metabolism, e.g. nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors (Zabka, Singh et al. 2015) . Genetic forms of atrophy occur in several strains of mice, including several mutant and transgenic mouse strains and rats. Ocular screening should be conducted prior to study inclusion and animals exhibiting atrophy removed, or equally distributed amongst dose groups. Photoreceptor degeneration may occur with remarkable sparing of the inner retinal layers and RPE. Outer retinal atrophy in rodents is characteristic of senile retinal degeneration, which has a tendency to begin at the peripheral retina (Hockwin, Green et al. 1992 ). Light-induced retinal atrophy/degeneration (usually RPE cells are not affected) occurs in albino rodents and is caused by prolonged exposure to light or exposure to high intensity light. These lighting conditions may occur if animals are kept in cages on the top of racks close to the room light source (De Vera Mudry, Kronenberg et al. 2013 ). In contrast, focal atrophy of outer retinal segments following choroidal circular disturbance is always associated with loss of regional RPE cells (Tanaka, Inagaki et al. 1993 ).",

The complete pathogenesis of iERM is unknown, but many theories have been proposed. The most widely accepted theory is that iERM is a consequence of surface breaks in the ILM of the retina and forms within the cortical vitreous, which serves as the structural component and provides a medium upon which glial cells and hyalocytes can proliferate. Impaired vision can result from retinal traction and detachment, or impediment of light transmission.",

Drusen contain zinc, which is thought to have a role in the precipitation and activation of the complement system (Lengyel, Flinn et al. 2007 ). These amorphous deposits may accumulate due to impaired transport of the debris through Bruch's membrane into the choroidal circulation. Drusen is a clinical diagnosis that characterizes these findings, and should be avoided as a histological diagnosis. Drusen are associated with age-related macular degeneration, and thus are rarely observed in species other than primates. However, 'hard' drusen (concentric, nodular mass, with well-defined borders; may be mineralized) do occur infrequently in some species other than humans. (Figure 49) Comment \"Subretinal membranes\" is a clinical term for fibroplasia occurring in the subretinal space, and in humans they tend to be associated with neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). They are rare in non-primate species, but can be experimentally induced using lasers. Membranes may be secondary to subretinal hemorrhage, retinal or choroidal inflammation, neovascular retinal or choroidal disease, or intraocular surgery. Osseous metaplasia (RPE metaplasia to an osseous phenotype) is a variation and is not well understood (Toyran, Lin et al. 2005 Pathogenesis/cell of origin RPE enlargement occurs with cellular disease, toxicity, or aging processes due to increase in size and number of organelles, enlargement of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (increased activity), or accumulation of lipofuscin.

A small superior arm is connected to a large inferior arm by a narrow band medial to the optic nerve. The color of the gland varies from pink to dark grey depending upon the abundance and characteristics of melanocytes in the capsule and interlobar septa (Markert and Silvers 1956 ). In addition, in rodents the gland is speckled with a pigment identified as a porphyrin that fluoresces under ultraviolet light, which is secreted by the gland, and the amount is said to vary with strain, sex, and age (Figge and Davidheiser 1957) . The tubuloalveolar gland is covered by a delicate connective tissue capsule bound loosely to the orbital fascia. Strands from the capsule divide the gland into lobes and lobules. The epithelial cells are pyramidal, their height depending upon the secretory phase. A round nucleus containing two or three nucleoli is located near the base, and the cytoplasm, packed with lipid droplets, appears finely vacuolated or foamy. Myoepithelial cells are present between the epithelial cells and the prominent basement membrane (Chiquoine 1958) . The primary glandular secretion are lipids (wax esters), secreted by exocytosis (merocrine-type excretion) and yellow-brown porphyrin pigment, which is not visualized within the cytoplasm but in the acinar and ductal lumina. The ducts are lined by cuboidal epithelium. Alveolar, lobular, and lobar ducts join to form a single excretory duct, which opens at the base of the nictitating membrane.",

The extraorbital gland of the rat is bean shaped (12 x 9 mm) and flat (2 mm thick), whereas the intraorbital gland has an approximate triangular form (major axis of 7.5 mm and 1 mm thickness) (Hebel and Stromberg 1986) . In the mouse, the extraorbital gland is approximately 3 mm in diameter and the intraorbital gland can be hardly visualized without magnification (Botts et al. 1999) . The excretory ducts of both glands fuse to form a common duct at the temporal angle of the palpebral fissure which opens into the conjunctival sac dorsally. Both lacrimal glands are tubuloacinar and histologically identical. Each is enclosed in a connective tissue capsule and divided by connective tissue septa into lobes and lobules. The serous secretory cells are pyramidal with granular basophilic cytoplasm that stains intensely near the round, basally-located nuclei, and stains much less intensely between the nuclei and the narrow acinar lumen. Myoepithe-lial cells are found between the epithelium and the basement membrane. The intralobular ducts are lined by cuboidal cells whereas the excretory ducts are lined by stratified columnar epithelium (Krinke et al. 1994; . Histologically, a gender dimorphism of the lacrimal glands can be observed after sexual maturity in rats, which increases with age and is characterized by scattered enlarged acinar epithelial cells containing enlarged nuclei (karyomegaly) in the male. In female rats, the lacrimal gland maintains the normal histological structure with aging, in males the lacrimal gland becomes pleomorphic (see Karyomegaly and Harderian gland alteration).",

Due to this anatomical and functional relation with the eye and glands of the eye, it is considered to be part of the lacrimal apparatus. The draining system begins with the lacrimal ducts at two puncta lacrimalia in each eye, oval openings located close to the edge of the eyelids lateral to the nasal angle of the palpebral fissure. The lacrimal ducts fuse nasally to form the nasolacrimal duct. In the rat, the paired nasolacrimal ducts are about 22 mm long, 0.5 by 0.2 mm wide in the initial portion and about 0.8 by 0.6 mm in its middle portion. Each nasolacrimal duct as a membranous tube runs along the outer aspect of the lacrimal bone, passes through the infraorbital fissure, and enters the osseous nasolacrimal canal, which crosses the alveolus of the incisor tooth ventrally. Within the region of the nasal cavity it runs in a channel formed by a ventral lamella of the maxilloturbinate and the os incisivum. At the rostral end of the maxilloturbinate it passes to the lateral wall of the nasal cartilage and about 2 mm caudal to the nostril opens ventromedially into the nasal vestibule (Hebel and Stromberg 1986) . Since the nasolacrimal duct is visualized when examining the nasal cavity at different section levels, this duct has been referred to as part of the upper respiratory system, or as an accessory structure of the nasal cavity. Depending on the section level of the nasal cavity examined, the nasolacrimal duct can be found dorsolateral to the maxillary sinus at level III (section through the second palatine crest including the first upper molars in the rat); laterally to the root of the incisor tooth at the level II (section at the incisive papilla in rat and mice) or ventromedial to the root of the incisor teeth at level I (section at the posterior part of the upper incisor teeth in rat and mice) (Monticello et al. 1990; Boorman et al. 1990; Uraih and Maronpot 1990; Kittel et al. 2004 ).The epithelium of the ducts in the mouse varies from slightly keratinized squamous or low cuboidal in levels I and II of the nasal cavity, to non-ciliated pseudostratified cuboidal or columnar epithelium in level III (Herbert and Leininger 1999) . According to other authors, stratified squamous epithelium is found at the origin and termination of the nasolacrimal duct. The rest of the duct is lined by pseudostratified non-ciliated columnar epithelium (Uraih and Maronpot 1990) . Furthermore, the nasolacrimal duct epithelium has been described as a transitional epithelium (Stewart et al. 1979) . Detailed descriptions of the mentioned epithelial types are missing. At level III of the nasal cavity, subepithelial lymphoid cell infiltrates appear to be associated to the initial part of the nasolacrimal duct (Monticello et al. 1990 ).",

In mice, the incidence of lymphocytic infiltrates increase with age and is more common in male than in female B6C3F1 mice (Botts et al. 1999 ). Lymphocytic inflammatory cell infiltrates occur spontaneously with advancing age and may or may not be associated with Harderization of the lacrimal gland.

Although uncommon in modern laboratory animal facilities, inflammation caused by Rat coronavirus/Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) is multilobular, with degeneration/necrosis as a prominent feature, accompanied by neutrophilic inflammation in early phases. In the late inflammatory phases, lymphocytes and macrophages as well as tubuloacinar squamous metaplasia are the most predominant features (Percy et al. 1989) . Chromodacryorrhea (red tears) may be present due to hypersecretion of porphyrin in cases of inflammation in the Harderian gland caused by the SDAV, however no porphyrin accretions are observed in the acini. Xenobiotic induced inflammation may be lymphocytic or mixed (lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages). In severe cases epithelial hyperplasia and interstitial fibrosis has been noted (Reuber 1976) . Chronic dacryoadenitis with degenerative epithelial changes and increased porphyrin secretion are reported to occur in the Harderian gland after long term treatment with an inotropic phosphodiesterase inhibitor in rats (Westwood et al. 1991) . SDAV also causes inflammation of the nasolacrimal ducts (Bihun and Percy 1995) . Inflammation of the nasal cavity is reported to occur with chemical induced inflammation of the ducts (National Toxicology Program 2010; Schoevers et al. 1994; Wagner et al. 2009 ). Drug-related inflammation needs to be differentiated from degeneration, necrosis and inflammation that is reported in the nasolacrimal duct of aged mice (Herbert and Leininger 1999) .",

The main olfactory epithelium houses basal (stem) cells, intermediate neuronal precursors, mature sensory neurons and sustentacular/supporting cells. Epithelial degeneration, necrosis and regeneration of the epithelium are often present together, when the tissue is repeatedly exposed to toxic chemicals, resulting in a disorganized morphologic picture (Renne et al. 2009; Hardisty et al. 1999) . MOE, olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb have a high regenerative capacity after injury. MOE regenerates from basal cells, Bowman's glands (epithelial or in the submucosa) and duct cells regenerate from progenitor cells within the ducts, whereas sustentacular cells can arise from both cell sources (Huard et al. 1998 ).

            "text": "The VNO is a bilateral tubular structure located ventrally, within the bone and cartilage at the base of the septum and opening to the nasal cavity. The lumina are lined laterally by respiratory epithelium and medially by neuronal epithelium (Figure 81 ). Like other olfactory epithelium it houses basal, neurosensory and sustentacular cells. At present, VNO is the only olfactory organ known to connect with the accessory olfactory bulb (Storan and Key 2006) . A low number of neutrophils appear to be normal constituents of the non-sensory, respiratory epithelium (Getchell and Kulkarni 1995; D\u00f8ving and Trotier 1998) . The neuronal epithelium is organized into different zones: the marginal zones at the transition/border with the respiratory epithelium; the intermediate zones and the central zone (Brann and Firestein 2010) . Vomeronasal glands are found apically of the tubules, within the cartilage that surrounds the VNO (Adams 1992) . Its main function is perception of pheromones. VNO is already well-developed at birth (Oikawa et al. 2001 ), but increases in size postnatally. The overall volume, neuroepithelial volume, and number of bipolar neurons are larger in males compared to females (Guillam\u00f3n and Segovia 1997) . Mitosis in the adult occurs particularly at the marginal zones of the neural epithelium (Weiler 2005; De La Rosa-Prieto et al. 2009; Mart\u00ednez-Marcos et al. 2000) . Neural turnover in the mouse in the VNO epithelium may occur especially through migration (Halpern and Mart\u00ednez-Marcos 2003) ; cells at the edges were found to migrate horizontally very slowly (less than 10% of the distance from the edge to the center of the epithelium per month). Distribution of apoptotic cells indicate that a number of cells in mitosis die before becoming functional neurons. Regeneration of new neurons is preserved even in aged rodents (De La Rosa-Prieto et al. 2010) .",

Like other olfactory epithelium it houses basal, neurosensory and sustentacular cells. The SOM is located rostral to the MOE and may serve as a rostral sensor in advance of MOE perception, triggering deeper inhalation (Marshall and Maruniak 1986) . Alternatively, SOM olfactory perception may be limited to certain chemical signatures dictated by the limited connection to specific regions within the olfactory bulb. SOM projects mainly to the posterior, ventromedial part of the main olfactory bulb (Ma et al. 2003) . Both options are supported by molecular analysis of the receptors present in SOM (Tian and Ma 2004; Su et al. 2009 ). The sensory neurons in the septal organ and in the MOE share signaling pathways and show similar odorant responses, but some receptors are present in SOM in very high densities. The SOM can serve as an airflow sensor in addition to its chemosensory roles (Ma 2010) .",

The glomerular layer receives direct input from the olfactory nerve, and their axons terminate in spherical structures known as glomeruli, where they connect in the external plexiform layer with the apical dendrites of mitral cells. The basal dendrites (internal plexiform layer) of the mitral cells transport the signals further to the olfactory cortex. Mitral cells are connected to interneurons known as granule cells, which are probably involved in inhibition processes. The accessory olfactory bulb, a region located dorsal-posterior to the main olfactory bulb, appears to operate independently from the main olfactory bulb (Yokosuka 2012) .

Even if SOM is potentially included, 'Metaplasia, respiratory cell', will often go unnoticed, because of similarity with surrounding tissue. Even changes like necrosis/ulceration can go unnoticed or ascribed to respiratory epithelium, especially in cases where the change is not restricted to SOM (see Figure, normal anatomy, Septal Organ of Masera) but includes/affects surrounding respiratory epithelium as well.",

Whether tumors arising from olfactory epithelium are more appropriately classified under the term neuroepithelial carcinoma or olfactory neuroblastoma cannot be resolved on the basis of current information, and they are considered synonyms in this manuscript. The general term neuroepithelial carcinoma is used here because it allows for origin of neoplasms from sensory or sustentacular cells, whereas olfactory neuroblastoma implies origin only from neurogenic components. There is clearly a need to develop procedures to distinguish neuroepithelial tumors of neurogenic origin (neuroblastoma, esthesioneuroblastoma), from those of nonneurogenic cell types, especially sustentacular cells and their precursors. When neither rosettes (true or pseudo) nor plexiform intercellular fibrils are demonstrable, a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma is preferable. Ultrastructural analysis of a neuroepithelial carcinoma should reveal some clear characteristics of olfactory epithelium such as olfactory vesicles, cilia, and microtubules.

The tympanic cavity is an air-filled space that extends into a ventral osseous expansion, the tympanic bulla, and contains the auditory ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes). The malleus (\"hammer\") is embedded broadly in the tympanic membrane and articulates with the incus (\"anvil\"). The malleus has muscular attachments to the wall of the tympanic wall. The incus articulates in turn with the stapes (\"stirrup\"); the footplate of the stapes lies in the oval window. Sound waves that cause vibration of the tympanic membrane are transmitted to the oval window by the bridging middle ear ossicles. This mechanical apparatus amplifies the transmitted vibrations, possibly providing an increase in magnitude of as much as 20-fold. Tension on the muscular attachments to the malleus can be lessened by feedback innervation in response to high ambient noise levels, thereby dampening this amplification as a protective mechanism. With a bit of patience and dissection, the ossicles can be evaluated grossly, and their articulations and movement tested at necropsy. The auditory (pharyngotympanic or Eustachian) tube originates at the rostral (anterior) wall of the tympanic cavity and extends to the nasopharynx.
