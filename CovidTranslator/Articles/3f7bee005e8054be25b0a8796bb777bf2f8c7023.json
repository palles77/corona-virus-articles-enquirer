Simulations of these models have previously been realized using informed ''guesses'' of the proposed model parameters and tested for consistency with the reported data by surrogate analysis. In this paper we attempt to provide statistically rigorous parameter distributions using Approximate Bayesian Computation sampling methods. We find that such sampling schemes are a useful framework for fitting parameters of stochastic small world network models where simulation of the system is straightforward but expressing a likelihood is cumbersome.",

The duration of the epidemic in Hong Kong was 105 days. This paper focuses on modelling the transmission of SARS within Hong Kong during this period. International travel networks facilitated the further spread of the virus to other cities. The effect of the SARS coronavirus was damaging both economically and socially and was indeed tragic for some individuals. Given the impact and widespread concern a virus such as SARS causes it is important for government and officials to make informed decisions regarding measures to deal with the virus and so reassure the public. Such measures might include quarantine, and questions about what type of quarantine and when to apply such a quarantine require answers and risk assessment. Furthermore, as the outbreaks in the Prince of Wales Hospital [1, 2] showed, even hospitalization cannot be considered an effective quarantine, nor could demanding people stay in their buildings, as the peculiarities of the virus spread in the Amoy Gardens Housing Estate demonstrated [3, 1] .",

That is, each infected individual has an equal chance of infecting any susceptible in the population regardless of its social structure. People know and come into contact with a varying number of individuals -the social secretary of a football club would meet many more individuals than a housebound person, for example -and so it makes sense to consider different infection rates for different individuals or assume some kind of (social) network structure within models.",

Two reasons for not doing so are that the number of parameters to be estimated would greatly increase, and our focus is on presenting a method for parameter inference. Nonetheless, it is clear how our methods can be readily generalized to include more complicated heterogeneous models. To focus our discussion we adopt an existing model [5] . This epidemiological model [5, 6] , in which an infection is mediated via a contact network with so-called ''small world'' properties [7] , has been shown to exhibit many of the features characteristic in the SARS epidemic spread in Hong Kong. In particular, a small number of individuals showed a great propensity to infect others, so-called ''super-spreaders'' (e.g., Ref. [8] ).",

The use of MCMC to fit stochastic epidemics is not new but since Small's small world disease model is probabilistic, MCMC appears to be a most useful methodology to attempt parameter fitting. For such network models as are employed here, however, the likelihood functions are complicated and often intractable, and so standard MCMC algorithms, which require explicit likelihood functions, cannot be applied. Instead, we turn to a form of MCMC called Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) [10] which instead relies on model simulation and realization. Summary statistics are used to compare simulated data from the model with the observed data; when the summary statistic is sufficient and the values from the simulated data exactly match those from the observed data, samples are obtained from the exact posterior distributions of the model parameters. When no sufficient statistic is available, acceptable parameter values are drawn from an approximation of this distribution.",

The motivation for this model is that the near-neighbour links provide a model of infection within households and between adjacent households. In a dense urban environment such as Hong Kong, it provides a model for the spread of contagion among families based on residential units. However, in an effort to simplify (and homogenise) the model structure we do not build separate family units into our model, rather, we assume that individuals residing in close proximity to one another are likely to spread an infection between them. 1 In addition to spread in residential environments, we build a random number of long-range links into the model. These long-range links account for the fact that individuals are free to move within in the community and will therefore have direct contact with others in different residential locations. We feel justified in using a random and long-tailed distribution for these connections (rather than the fixed number associated with the regular grid) because the number (and diversity) of contacts an individual will have will vary greatly between individuals. Moreover, the probability of infecting near neighbours (considered to be members of the same household) is likely to be distinct from the probability of infecting remotely-linked neighbours (say, daily acquaintances).",

[6] the total number of infected individuals throughout (i.e., integrated over) the period of the epidemic was used as a filter to identify model realizations which were similar to the data. This suggests that such a quantity is a good candidate to choose as the summary statistic to compare to the data in the ABC algorithms. It turns out, however, that such a choice does not result in inferred parameters whose simulated realizations are similar to the data. Instead we typically obtain Table 1 A comparison of the number of model realizations required to obtain the last particle (sampled parameter set) at the given tolerance. We see that as the tolerance becomes stricter the number of realizations increases significantly, however, this is still much smaller than the number we would expect if we were to begin with the strictest tolerance of all. model realizations which have high p 2 probabilities (long-range infections) and after t = 60, a removal rate of r 13 very close to one. It also seems natural to directly compare x(t) with the observed case data but since the actual data appears quite noisy, with large deviations from a smooth, deterministic curve, the comparison of such a data set with similar stochastic realizations in the ABC-PRC algorithm can produce large errors, and so have a very low acceptance rate. Since the system is such that Pr(x * = D) \u2248 0, we must use a summary statistic, and so choose one which allows for such stochastic variation whilst preserving the gross features of the data which we wish to represent. Consider, for example, the case when the peak is offset by only one or two days while other aspects of the data are well-represented, a case in which we may wish to accept the generating parameters. To allow for such variation, we have chosen S to be a moving-average filter, thus allowing comparisons to be made between smoothed versions of the observed and simulated data sets. Fig. 2 shows the actual data in blue and a smoothed version with a window size of 10 in red. This is the S(D) we compare our realizations S(x * ) to using \u03c1 as Euclidean distance. This choice of S and \u03c1 allows us to accept parameter values which produce data sets matching the trajectory of the data without being overly sensitive to the exact realization obtained via simulation. While no sufficient statistic for this model is known to us, the moving-average filter preserves important features of the data, as discussed below.",

To accept even very good parameters we would need a large , thus also accepting many bad parameter sets. Conversely, if the window length is too long, S approximates the mean of the data, and so information about important local features, such as regions of rise and fall and turning points, is lost.

It is, however, better to start with an 1 much greater than this value to find an initial set of particles (sampled parameter sets) as finding subsequent particle sets at lower tolerances takes fewer model realizations than going straight to low tolerances to begin with. As such we consider the following decreasing set of tolerances in our ABC-PRC procedure: 500, 250, 190, 150, 125, 100, 75, 50, 45, 40}. In MCMC, the use of uninformative priors means that the posterior distributions are entirely informed by the observed data, and this principle was followed here. For the network parameter \u00b5, a wide uniform prior distribution was chosen, mainly enforcing positivity, with \u00b5 \u223c Unif{[0, 10]}. The remaining parameters, the transition probabilities, used uninformative Unif{[0, 1]} priors. A stronger reliance could be placed on existing parameter values by the use of more informative priors. Table 1 summarizes the number of model realizations taken to find the 250th particle for each tolerance. In the perturbation part of step 2a of the ABC-PRC algorithm we use a zero-mean Gaussian with a standard deviation of 5% of the range of the sampled parameter values.",

The improvement gained in the resolution of the sampled distributions can be seen by comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 4 which are obtained using tolerances = 1000 and = 40 respectively. We see in Fig. 4 that the sampled parameters obtained at the stricter tolerance start to reveal informative, unimodal distributions. We summarize the means of these estimated distributions in Table 2 . In the paper of Ref. [6] the parameters shown in row one of Table 2 are the ones used. In the second row of the table we present the mean of the samples obtained using our strictest tolerance = 40. We can see recognizable distributions developing as the tolerance lowers but at the expense of many more model realizations.

The first point to note is that apart from the parameter r 0 , the means of the estimated posterior distributions are quite different from the values used by Small and Tse [6] , which lie in the posterior distributions' tails. We do, however, observe the same general trend about the assumptions of the spread of the disease. That is, early on in the epidemic we note high values for the rate of long-range transmission together with a lower removal rate. As we proceed through the course of the epidemic the long-range transmission rate falls and the removal rate rises. A final point of observation is the apparent correlation between the transmission rate p 1 and the network parameter for acquaintances \u00b5. There appears to be a negative correlation between these two parameters, however, whether or not this suggestion is fact requires further simulation at ever lower tolerances, with correspondingly longer computation times. We can see from Finally, in Fig. 6 the number of infected individuals at different times during the course of the outbreak are shown for all accepted realisations at the lowest tolerance level, together with the data. We can see that the realizations have the capability to capture many features of the observed (revised) case data, only failing at the peak of the revised case numbers. This suggests that as good as the model is, more work is required, such as investigating other social network structures, perhaps scale-free distributions rather than exponential, in an effort to attain this peak value.",

The model in question has been shown to be capable of capturing the behaviour of the observed case data seen in the spread of the SARS-CoV outbreak in Hong Kong during 2003 [5] . The model is probabilistic both in terms of the mode of transmission between individuals and the connections between individuals. In particular, individuals are assumed to be connected, and hence capable of transmitting the virus, to a fixed number of close neighbours (relatives) and a small number of more distant individuals, the latter number being identified from an exponential distribution.
