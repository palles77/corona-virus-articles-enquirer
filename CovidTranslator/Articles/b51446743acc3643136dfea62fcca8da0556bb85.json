            "text": "Viral infection converts the normal constitution of a cell to optimise viral entry, replication, and virion production. These conversions contain alterations or disruptions of the tight and adherens junctions between cells as part of their pathogenesis, and reorganise cellular microfilaments that initiate, sustain and spread the viral infections and so on. Using porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and a model of normal intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2), we researched the interaction between tight and adherens junctions and microfilaments of IPEC-J2 cells with these viruses. In our work, the results showed that IPEC-J2 cells were susceptible to TGEV and PEDV infection. And TGEV could impair the barrier integrity of IPEC-J2 cells at early stages of infection through down-regulating some proteins of tight and adherens junctions, while PEDV cloud cause a slight of damage in the integrity of epithelial barrier. In addition, they also could affect the microfilaments remodelling of IPEC-J2 cells, and the drug-interfered microfilaments could inhibit viral replication and release. Furthermore, PEDV + TGEV co-infection was more aggravating to damage of tight junctions and remodelling of microfilaments than their single infection. Finally, the PEDV and TGEV infection affected the MAPK pathway, and inhibition of MAPK pathway regulated the changes of tight junctions and microfilaments of cells. These studies provide a new insight from the perspective of the epithelial barrier and microfilaments into the pathogenesis of PEDV and TGEV.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) are members of the Coronaviridae family (Sestak and Saif, 2002) . They both replicate in the differentiated enterocytes covering the villi of the porcine small intestine (Kim and Chae, 2003) and cause acute enteritis in swine of all ages, which is characterised by vomiting, diarrhoea, and dehydration; the mortality rate in seronegative suckling piglets may reach 100% (Chae et al., 2000) . Despite the similar clinical diseases and lesions induced, PEDV and TGEV are distinct viral entities. PEDV is unable to grow in porcine cell cultures permissive to the growth of TGEV, such as PK15 cells, and is more closely related to the human respiratory coronavirus HCoV 229E than to TGEV according to the amino acid sequence of the membrane protein (Kim et al., 1999) .Enterocytes are connected to each other to form a barrier that separates the inside of the organism from its environment. Essential components of this epithelial fence are the tight and adherens junctions (TJs and AJs) (Cereijido et al., 2008) . Some pathogens use tight junction proteins as receptors for their attachment and subsequent internalisation, such as Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and reoviruses (Evans et al., 2007; Guglielmi et al., 2007) . Infectious enteric agents that alter tight junctions often elicit inflammatory cascades and cause diarrhoea. Rotaviruses are a major cause of viral gastroenteritis leading to diarrhoea and morbidity in mammals. Its VP8 protein alters the localisation of claudin-3, ZO-1 and occludin, which consequently leads to disruption of the barrier integrity of tight junctions during their infection (Nava et al., 2004) . TGEV and PEDV also cause severe diarrhoea in piglets, but it is not known whether this is related to damage to the TJs and AJs of epithelial cells.In addition, TJs and AJs use a variety of transmembrane proteins linked to the microfilaments and to intracellular signalling molecules (Etournay et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Mariscal et al., 2008) . Following the changes to TJs and AJs, the microfilaments of the host cell are often co-opted by viruses at many stages of their life cycle, such as attachment, internalisation, endocytosis, nuclear targeting, replication, assembly, or cell-to-cell spread. Viruses induce rearrangements of microfilaments so that they can utilise them as tracks or move them aside when they represent barriers. Viral particles recruit molecular motors in order to hitchhike rides to different subcellular sites which provide the proper molecular environment for uncoating, replicating and packaging viral genomes (Burckhardt and Greber, 2009; Vaughan et al., 2009) . However, there are few reports about the interactions of PEDV and TGEV with microfilaments of host cells.Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are Ser/Thr protein kinases that respond to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and stress, among others. Previous studies have shown that the MAPK signalling pathway cannot only up-or down-regulate the expression of several TJ proteins to alter the molecular composition within TJ complexes, but also plays an important role in microfilament remodelling (Gerits et al., 2007; Melamed et al., 1995) .To clearly answer the questions of whether PEDV and TGEV infection could impair the tight and adherens junctions of epithelial cells, how interactions with PEDV, TGEV and microfilaments of epithelial cells occur, and how to change the proteins in the MAPK signalling pathway, we used PEDV and TGEV to infect the porcine intestinal epithelial cell line . Results showed that both PEDV and TGEV could infect IPEC-J2 cells, and that they could also down-regulate certain proteins of tight and adherens junctions to alter the epithelial barrier integrity. In addition, they affected the polymerisation and depolymerisation of microfilaments in IPEC-J2 cells, and the disordered microfilaments could also suppress the replication and release of these viruses. Furthermore, PEDV + TGEV co-infection enhanced the damage to tight junctions and the remodelling of microfilaments. Finally, PEDV and TGEV infection impacted on activation of the MAPK signalling pathway in IPEC-J2 cells, and MAPK inhibitor could affect the tight junctions and microfilaments of cells.",

From the results, both PEDV and TGEV could infect the IPEC-J2 cells. After PEDV infection 6 h and TGEV infection 12 h, the immunofluorescences were read visually from images. Initially, the immunofluorescences were distributed in the plasma membrane, then in the cytoplasm. The above phenomenon might because the two viruses were first distributed in the plasma membrane, then they increased in the cytoplasm from 12 to 24 hpi. Finally, these viruses decreased in the cytoplasm over time due to lack of nutrients for the IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 1A) . Similarly, the phenomenon of PEDV or TGEV single infection was consistent with their co-infection (Fig. 1B) . To study the percentage of PEDV and TGEV infected IPEC-J2, TCID 50 was used to draw the viral proliferation curve. In the early infection (6 hpi), the titre of TGEV replication was lower than PEDV. At 24 hpi, although both TGEV and PEDV reached the replication peak, the titre of TGEV replication was still lower than the PEDV. The data showed that the same concentration of TGEV and PEDV infected the IPEC-J2 cells, the PEDV replication was faster that TGEV. Moreover, the higher the concentration of virus was, the faster the virus replication was to reach the peak . These data showed that MOI 1 of PEDV and TGEV infection reached a peak at 24 hpi, while the MOI 0.1 of their infection reached a peak at 48 hpi and then gradually decreased (Fig. 1C) .",

The intensity of the bands in terms of political density was measured and normalised against GAPDH expression. Data express the mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3). The symbol * indicates statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) when compared with the control group, and the symbol ** indicates statistically very significant differences (P < 0.01) when compared with the control group. declined again after 60 min, and restored again at 2 hpi. TEER then remains more or less unchanged. Compared with the control group, TGEV single infection or co-infection decreased gradually from 20 to 60 min and reached the lowest value at 60 min, especially in the case of their co-infection. Then, levels all gradually restored and remained unchanged from 2 to 84 h ( Fig. 2A) . Finally, the TEER in TGEV and/or PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells were unchanged compared with control group from 84 to 120 hpi, gradually decreased from 132 to 204 hpi that might be due to the IPEC-J2 cells death (Additional Fig. 1) . To further study whether the permeability of epithelial cells infected with PEDV, TGEV and PEDV + TGEV were changed from 20 to 60 minpi, we measured the passage of a macromolecule, FITC-dextran, across these virusinfected IPEC-J2 monolayer cells grown on Transwell membranes. The permeability of IPEC-J2 infected with TGEV at 40 minpi was higher than other groups (p < 0.05) and the above permeability at 60 minpi was also significantly increased compared to the control group (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B) . To further investigate whether tight and adhesion junctions proteins played an important role in the instantaneous destruction of the epithelial barrier integrity at 20, 40, 60 minpi and 24 hpi, we measured the three important tight junction proteins claudin-1, occluding and ZO-1 and an adhesion junction protein E-cadherin in the PEDV-, TGEV-infected and their co-infected IPEC-J2 cells. The results demonstrated that the expression of E-cadherin in the PEDV + TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells at 20 minpi was higher than the control group and PEDV infected group (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression of E-cadherin in the TGEV-infected and PEDV + TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells at 40 minpi were notably lower than other groups (p < 0.05). The expression of E-cadherin, Occludin and ZO-1 in the TGEV infectedand PEDV + TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells was lowest at 60 minpi (p < 0.01). Finally, claudin-1, occluding, ZO-1 and E-cadherin were unchanged in TGEV, PEDV-infected and PEDV +TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells compared with the control group at 24 hpi (p > 0.05). All of the results demonstrated that TGEV and TGEV + PEDV coinfection could instantaneously impair the integrity of epithelial barrier at early stages of infection, and then gradually return back to normal levels.

We hypothesised that the life cycle of PEDV and TGEV were also dependent on the microfilaments. From the results of TEM, PEDV and TGEV moved along the filopodia which are formed by microfilaments and moved towards the cells (Fig. 3A) . Many microfilaments gathered around the PEDV, and appeared to be auxiliary to form membrane vesicles for wrapping the virus when the PEDV absorbed the plasma membrane ( Fig. 3A and B) . In the cytoplasm, a large number of microfilaments gathered around the PEDV, suggesting that the movement of viruses relies on the microfilaments (Fig. 3C) . The same phenomena were also seen in the TGEV infected ( Fig. 3D-F) and PEDV + TGEV co-infected IPEC-J2 cells (pictures not shown), and we also observed the virus binding the microfilaments in the nuclear membrane (Fig. 3D) .",

First, the data showed that neither Jas nor Cyto D affected the ability of PEDV, TGEV and PEDV + TGEV to enter the IPEC-J2 cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4D, left) . However, Cyto D notably inhibited all viral release from IPEC-J2 (p < 0.05), and the Jas group only inhibited viral release in the PEDV + TGEV co-infection group (Fig. 4D, middle) . Finally, Cyto D and Jas treated IPEC-J2 cells significantly decreased the replication and release of all viruses, especially when using the Cyto D treatment (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4D, right) . To further validate the effects of microfilament disorder on the attachment, replication and release of PEDV and TGEV, the qRT-PCR was used to detect the viral level. Form the results, only Cyto D could affect the ability of TGEV to enter the IPEC-J2 cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4G) .

These results implied that microfilament disorder of IPEC-J2 cells did not affect the attachment of PEDV and TGEV, but inhibited the replication and release of them.

As we showed in Fig. 6A , inhibition of MAPKs failed to increase the viral replication. The ERK-MAPK-specific inhibitor (PD98059) and JNK-MAPK-specific inhibitor (SP600125) notably decreased the level of PEDV and TGEV infection at 12 hpi (p < 0.05) and 24 hpi (p < 0.05), and PD98059 extremely significantly inhibited the TGEV replication 24 hpi (p < 0.01), while p38-MAPK-specific inhibitor (SB203580) could not significantly inhibited the TGEV and PEDV replication (p > 0.05). These results indicated that MAPKs inhibitors, especially for ERK and JNK, were involved in PEDV and TGEV infection. From  Fig. 6B , we could observed the PD98059 and SB203580 could significantly decreased the expression of E-cadherin and Occludin in the TGEV and PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells at 12 hpi, and PD98059 also notably decreased the expression of E-cadherin, Occludin and Zo-1 in the TGEV and PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells at 24 hpi. Moreover, SB203580 could suppress the expression of Claudin-1 in the TGEV and PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells at 24 hpi. Thus, the results demonstrated that MAPKs inhibitors, especially for ERK and p38, could affect the expression of tight junctions of IPEC-J2 cells. Finally, the results from Fig. 6C and Additional Fig. 2 showed that inhibition of MAPKs significantly affected the microfilaments of IPEC-J2 cells. We observed that the microfilaments of IPEC-J2 cells treated with MAPKs inhibitors (PD98059, SB203580 and SP600125) disappeared in the cytoplasm or became more diffuse in the cytoplasm, then gathered in the plasma membrane after 40, 60 min and 12, 24 h of PEDV and TGEV infection.

Some viruses have developed specific strategies to alter or disrupt these structures as part of their pathogenesis, resulting in either viruses penetration, or other consequences such as diarrhoea (Coyne et al., 2007; Nava et al., 2004) . Rotavirus decreases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increases paracellular permeability through decreased levels of claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 proteins in the perijunctional region of Caco-2 monolayers; this was closely related to the fact that it caused viral astroenteritis leading to diarrhoea and morbidity in mammals (Nava et al., 2004) . TGEV and PEDV also cause severe diarrhoea in piglets, whether this phenomenon is correlated to the damaged AJC in epithelial cells? Similarly, in our work, the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1 were significantly reduced in the TGEV and PEDV + TGEV infected IPEC-J2 cells in early infection, while these four tight and adhesion junctions proteins unchanged in the TGEV and PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells compared the control group in 24 hpi; therefore, the TEER of IPEC-J2 decreased and the permeability of IPEC-J2 increased, leading to the barrier integrity of IPEC-J2 cells undergoing temporary destruction. Subsequently, the barrier integrity returned to normal levels through self-repair over time. The rapid reduction of E-cadherin, occludin and ZO-1 in infection may be related to the virus internalisation. Previous reports have shown that adenoviruses-2 and -5 and Coxsackievirus use CAR as a receptor (Bergelson et al., 1997) for their internalisation .

(B) Bar graphs show the relative rate of phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-p38 and phosphor-JNK in the PEDV-, TGEV-, and PEDV + TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells at 60 minpi (up) and 24 hpi (down). Data express the mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3). The symbol * indicates statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) when compared with the control group, and the symbol ** indicates statistically very significant differences (P < 0.01) when compared with the control group. and to break the epithelial barrier during viral escape. Whether the PEDV and TGEV use the AJC proteins as their receptor for their flexible invasion is not clear, but at least we observed that the epithelial barrier was destroyed in early viral infection. The expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1 were more reduced in the IPEC-J2 cells infected with TGEV and PEDV + TGEV than PEDV infection at 60 minpi probably because the virulence of TGEV is stronger than that of PEDV.",

Regulation of the microfilaments and their interactions with TJ components play a major role in the infection of viruses. Furthermore, viruses use the host microfilament transport systems and their motors for several steps during their life cycle (Taylor et al., 2011) . From our TEM results, during the infection of PEDV and TGEV, their attachment, internalisation, nuclear targeting, transport of progeny viral . The symbol * indicates statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) when compared with the control group, and the symbol ** indicates statistically very significant differences (P < 0.01) when compared with the control group. (B) The expression of Claudin-1, E-cadherin, Occludin and ZO-1 in PEDV and TGEV infected and mock IPEC-J2 cells which treated with or without MAPKs inhibitors, PD98059, SB203580 and SP600125 at 60 minpi and 24 hpi was analysed via western blotting. (C) Immunofluorescence images of microfilaments in PEDV and TGEV infected and mock IPEC-J2 cells which treated with or without treated with or without MAPKs inhibitors, PD98059, SB203580 and SP600125 at 60 minpi were stained with FTTC-phalloidin. Scale bars represent 10 m. Immunofluorescence images of microfilaments of the mock IPEC-J2 cells were a complex three-dimensional network composed of microfilaments extending throughout the cell body. Microfilaments of IPEC-J2 cells treated by PD98059, SB203580 and SP600125 disappeared in the cytoplasm or became more diffuse in the cytoplasm, and gathered in the plasma membrane after 60 min of infecting PEDV and TGEV. particles and release was shown to be assisted by the microfilaments during the viral campaign, suggesting that actin filaments play important roles in virus life cycles. However, the question of what changes in the distribution of microfilaments occurred during the process of viral infection remained? First, the microfilaments of PEDV-and TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 retracted and concentrated around certain membrane structures and the plasma membrane, which might indicate preparation for the adsorption and internalisation of the virus. Then, the bundles of microfilaments were seen to line the plasma membrane in infected IPEC-J2, which might indicate the attachment and internalisation of these viruses. Similarly, HIV, measles virus or herpes simplex virus also cause the microfilaments to concentrate around the plasma membrane for their attachment and internalisation (D\u00f6hner and Sodeik, 2005; Smith and Helenius, 2004) . After internalisation, these viruses are transported inside vesicles to the cytosol for replication of their genome and protein synthesis. Subsequently, the subviral components are found to bud from the plasma membrane via disruption of this membrane, which frees all of the progeny. Thus, after 12 h of infection, the microfilaments appeared as numerous of spottinglike structures around the nuclear membrane in all virus-infected IPEC-J2 cells. These spotting-like structures might be the ER or the Golgi apparatus which were the site of viral genome replication and protein synthesis. The microfilaments then gradually located in the perinuclear area and the plasma membrane, and this may be an indication that these viruses were budding from the plasma membrane. These results implied that viruses can interfere with cytoskeleton and induce actin rearrangements, supporting infection. However, determination of whether those spotting-like structures were ER or Golgi apparatus requires further research.",

We found that neither stabilised nor depolymerised microfilaments affected the adsorption process of these viruses. That might be because the changes in the distribution of microfilaments did not decrease the number of viral receptors, but simply affected the speed of viral adsorption. However, microfilament disorder, either stabilisation or depolymerisation, could inhibit the replication and release of viruses, and in particular the depolymerisation of microfilaments. These results were consistent with a requirement of dynamic microfilaments for other viruses, such as Echovirus 11 and herpesvirus, among others (Forest et al., 2005; Sobo et al., 2012) . However, it was not clear how these stabilised or depolymerised microfilaments affected the viral production and budding. The RNA genome of human parainfluenza virus type 3 is replicated and transcribed in association with ribonucleoproteins bound to microfilaments, and depolymerisation of microfilaments inhibits viral RNA synthesis (Gupta et al., 1998) . Simpson-Holley reported that budding of the influenza virus is also affected by microfilament-depolymerising drugs, probably because the microfilament cortex maintains the correct structure of lipid rafts that are incorporated into the viral envelope (Simpson-Holley et al., 2002) . The exact mechanisms why the microfilament depolymerisation or stabilisation inhibited the replication and release of PEDV and TGEV are still unclear and require further investigation.",

            "text": "In our work, the lowest TEER and the highest permeability of IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV, TGEV and PEDV + TGEV appeared at 60 minpi. Moreover, the ratio of phospho-ERK1 and phospho-JNK of IPEC-J2 cells significantly increased at the same time postinfection. However, we observed the opposite results at 24 hpi. A similar report showed that the HIV-1 Tat protein could trigger the disappearance of ZO-1 from cell-cell contact sites in brain endothelia due to ERK1/2 activation (Andr\u00e1s et al., 2005) . Patrick indicated that TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 could damage the epithelial barrier by downregulating the expression of occludin and ZO-1 through activating ERK1/2and p38 in MDCK cells (Patrick et al., 2006) . We speculated that TGEV-and PEDV-damaged barrier function of IPEC-J2 cells may be related to the phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-38 of the MAPK pathway activation. The ERK and p38 inhibitors significantly decreased the expression of the E-cadherin, Occludin and Zo-1 in the TGEV and PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells, which indicated that activation of ERK and p38 probably involved in the damage of barrier function of IPEC-J2 cells when IPEC-J2 cells were infected with PEDV and TGEV. Moreover, the MAPK pathway also plays an important role in microfilaments remodelling. After 1 h of infection, the microfilaments were found to line in the plasma membrane among all virus-infected IPEC-J2 cells. Simultaneously, the ratio of phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-JNK in these viruses infected IPEC-J2 cells significantly increased. After 24 h of infection, the microfilaments in a perinuclear location formed juxtanuclear caps or rings, while the phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-38 in the infected IPEC-J2 cells significantly decreased. In endothelial cells, p38 MAPK is reported to activate MAPK-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase 2, which phosphorylates the 27 kDa heat shock protein (HSP27), an F-actin cap binding protein, which causes actin depolymerisation (Kutsuna et al., 2004) . SARS-CoV N protein also activates the p38 MAPK pathway to induce the reorganisation of microfilaments in cells devoid of growth factors (Surjit et al., 2004) . TGEV-and PEDVinduced microfilament modelling might be due to the activation or inactivation of phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-38 in the MAPK pathway. Using the MAPKs inhibitors to treat with the IPEC-J2 cells, the microfilaments of cells disappeared in the cytoplasm or became more diffuse in the cytoplasm, then gathered in the plasma membrane after 40, 60 min and 12, 24 h of PEDV and TGEV infection. These results suggested that MAPKs inhibitors, ERK, p38 and JNK, were involved in the microfilaments of IPEC-J2 cells. In addition, inhibition of MAPKs also decreased the PEDV and TGEV infection, which was consistent with the report that the effect of MAPK pathway inhibitors on HIV infection (Gong et al., 2011) . However, the relationship between the PEDV and TGEV infection and MAPK pathway remains to be further investigated.",
