In the absence of a vaccine, public health responses have focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (10) . These NPIs include: (1) \"case-based\" measures such as testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, and (2) \"non-case-based\" measures such as reducing the probability of transmission given an effective contact (e.g. hand hygiene, and cough etiquette), and social distancing measures to reduce the contact rate in the population. Social distancing minimizes opportunities for person-to-person transmission of the virus to occur. These social distancing measures include some combination of school closure, teleworking, cancellation of group activities and events, and a general overall reduction in community contacts. While they are expected to be effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are also associated with substantial economic costs and social disruption.",

An overview of the model compartments and movements between them is provided in Figure 1 and model equations and additional details are provided in the Technical Appendix. The model was run for a period of two years and we assumed that recovered individuals remain immune from reinfection for the duration of the epidemic. Individuals remained infectious until they recovered or were hospitalized; we did not model transmission within healthcare settings. For simplicity, we assumed that all deaths occurred in cases requiring intensive care. We included cases in hospital and requiring intensive care to estimate health care requirements over the course of the epidemic. The model was constructed in R (13) .",

Details of parameters that were varied under different interventions are included in Table 2 . For the base case, we assumed that there was a degree of testing and isolation occurring and that a proportion of exposed cases were quarantined. We then added in additional control measures: (i) enhanced testing and contact tracing; (ii) restrictive social distancing measures; and (iii) a combination of enhanced testing and contract tracing, along with less restrictive social distancing than in (ii). We considered two approaches to implementing interventions: (i) fixed durations and (ii) a dynamic approach with interventions turned on and off based on the number of cases requiring ICU care in the population. We focused on ICU capacity, since this is expected to be most limited resource during the COVID-19 epidemic. Prior to emergence of COVID-19, Ontario had approximately 1300 ICU beds with associated ventilators; but 90% were occupied by individuals with non-.

While severe illness, particularly in older individuals, is frequent enough to overwhelm a society's ICU capacity (19) , mild unrecognized illness (particularly in younger individuals) contributes to spread (20) , and epidemics may only be recognized when superspreader events occur (21) , often in vulnerable settings like health care facilities (22) . In contrast to SARS (23), the high frequency of mild cases means that strategies which focus on case identification and isolation alone are likely to fail (22) . Control strategies for COVID-19 thus need to balance competing risks: the risks of mortality and health system collapse, on the one hand, against economic risks and attendant hardships (and health consequences) on the other. In this work, we evaluated plausible strategies for attenuating the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario, Canada. We focussed on ICU resources for two reasons: first, because this component of most health systems represents a scarce resource prone to being saturated; and secondly because such saturation results in abrupt surges in casefatality, as individuals with acute respiratory distress syndrome will die quickly without the .

In broad terms, we find that prolonged social distancing is the preferred strategy for maintaining ICU resources, but an extreme fixed duration of social distancing is required to prevent the epidemic from overwhelming ICU capacity.

Social distancing can be relaxed, but this inevitably results in resurgent disease in the population, requiring reinstatement. Nonetheless, dynamic social distancing is projected to maintain ICU capacity, and dramatically reduces overall attack rates, while at the same time requiring less total social distancing time than would be required by a fixed duration strategy of comparable effectiveness. Furthermore, dynamic social distancing has the potential to allow populations, and the economy, to \"come up for air\" at intervals, which may make this strategy more sustainable. We also found that a combination approach, with less restrictive social distancing along with enhanced case isolation and quarantine, could have a similar effect in the dynamic scenario as more restrictive social distancing alone. It is plausible that, as testing capacity increases, a combination approach that is less reliant on social distancing, will strike the right balance between disease control and societal disruption (30).",

Any model involves trade-offs between simplicity and realism, and in the current work we have not attempted to model social distancing measures in a highly realistic way, but rather generically as reductions in contact frequency. Our understanding of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to evolve and the precise role of pre-symptomatic and subclinical transmission is uncertain. Social distancing becomes a more important control measure in the face of incomplete case ascertainment due to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases.

While events in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and elsewhere have demonstrated that COVID-19 epidemics can be contained (24-27), the seeding of epidemics in countries around the globe, many with weak health systems (28), means that reintroduction of COVID-19 will continue to occur for some time. As successful containment efforts maintain a large number of susceptible individuals in populations, vulnerability to repeated epidemics is likely to persist until a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and manufactured at scale; or until large fractions of the population are infected and either die or develop immunity (29).",
