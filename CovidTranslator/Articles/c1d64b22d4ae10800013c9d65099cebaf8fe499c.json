We share an exceptional symbiotic relationship with them, with each one of us harbouring almost 10e100 trillion microbiota in our bodies which forms about 10% of our body weight. 1 They live on our body surfaces (gut, oral cavity, vagina, skin, etc), and also some of the really smart bacteria/archea merged with our cells about 1.5 billion years ago and became part of us. 2 Today, they handle the energy economy in each of our cell efficiently and go by the name of mitochondria. 3 They also make for formidable foes when they don the guise of pathogens, and mankind has been in a constant state of war with them. Our immune system evolved in response to their onslaughts, and we created an additional layer of defence in the form of antibiotics and antimicrobials. Despite the astounding depths of our understanding about them, we often find ourselves outwitted in the ongoing war. New pathogens emerge periodically to keep us on our toes as is evinced by emergence and spread of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, Zika and HIV epidemics. Development of multidrug resistance among bacteria, fungi and viruses is challenging our ability to fight back and herald difficult times ahead. 4 Even diseases once considered eradicated (such as anthrax and smallpox) have a potential to make a comeback as a result of rogue intent.",

The guidelines have undergone numerous updates in the last 2 decades, and the current guidelines recommend starting ART for all patients irrespective of their CD4 counts.
