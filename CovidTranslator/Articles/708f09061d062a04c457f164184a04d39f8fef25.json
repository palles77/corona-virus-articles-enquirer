These unique nucleoside analogues have been termed 'fleximers' and were designed to explore how nucleobase flexibility affects the recognition, binding, and activity of nucleoside(tide) analogues. 11 fleximers possess a purine base scaffold in which the imidazole and pyrimidine moieties are attached by a single carbon-carbon bond, rather than being 'fused' as is typical for the purines (Fig. 1) . These analogues are designed to retain all of the requisite purine hydrogen bonding patterns while allowing the nucleobase to explore alternative binding modes. Previous work from our group have shown these analogues to have several strategic advantages-increased binding affinity compared to the corresponding rigid inhibitors, binding affinity to atypical enzymes, as well as the ability to overcome point mutations in biologically significant binding sites. 11, 12, 17 In designing the target molecules the flex-base modification of the fleximers was combined with the acyclic sugar moiety of acyclovir (ACV). ACV is a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor currently approved for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections. 18 Recently, it was also found to have activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when McGuigan's ProTide technology was employed. 19 It was found to suppress the replication of both HIV-1 and HSV-2 in the submicromolar range in lymphoid and cervicovaginal human tissues and at 3-12 lmol/L in CD4+ T cells. 19 Our analogues were designed in hopes of mimicking this broad-spectrum biological activity.",

Preparation of the boronic acid 9 followed established procedures 21 and was used immediately without further characterization. Using standard Suzuki reaction conditions in the presence of freshly prepared Pd(PPh 3 ) 4, 10 was obtained in a 45% yield. In order to obtain the xanthosine analogue, 10 was treated with Pd/C to remove the benzyl protecting groups to yield final compound 1 in a 26% yield. It was also discovered that by lowering the temperature of the reaction, the benzyl groups could be selectively removed from the base. This is convenient, as it would allow for future functionalization of 11 without the need to selectively reprotect the free hydroxyl.",

Unfortunately, the reaction resulted in a single site transformation at the 4-position. Due to extreme reaction conditions and low yield this route was abandoned. Ultimately, the guanosine analogues were obtained through Stille coupling of key intermediate 8 with the appropriate pyrimidine 13. Pyrimidine 13 was prepared from commercially available 2-amino-5-chloro-6-methoxy pyrimidine according to published procedures. The subsequent coupling was completed using modified Stille coupling conditions based on the findings of Mee et al. 22 In order to acquire final compound 2, a selective deprotection was used to remove the benzyl group, while leaving the 6-methoxy intact. This was done with Pd/C in the presence of ammonium formate in EtOH under reflux for 18 h. This yielded 2 in a 24% yield, with the remainder (52%) retrievable as starting material, which could be recycled. The final deprotection was accomplished with BBr 3 at room temperature to yield 3 in a 24% yield (Scheme 3).",
