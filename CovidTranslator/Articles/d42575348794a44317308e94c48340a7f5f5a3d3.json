The structural proteins of RV are initially translated as a precursor polyprotein in the order NH,-C-E2-El-COOH from a 24s subgenomic mRNA (Oker-Blom, 1984) . After synthesis, the polyprotein is cleaved to yield two membrane glycoproteins, El (58 kDa) and E2 (42-47 kDa), and a basic 33 kDa capsid (C) protein (Oker-Blom, 1984; Oker-Blom et al., 1983) . El and E2 comprise the spike complex and are thought to exist as heterodimers (Waxham and Wolinsky, 1983; Hobman et al., 1993) . Insertion of glycoproteins El and E2 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is mediated by two independently functioning signal peptides which are cleaved by host signal peptidase (Hobman et al., 1988; Hobman and Gillam, 1989) . RV glycoproteins form a heterodimer in the ER before they are transported to and retained in the Golgi complex (Hobman et al., 1993; Baron and Forsell, 1991) . In transfected COS cells, small quantities of E2 can be detected at the cell surface in the presence or absence of El (Hobman and Gillam, 1989; Hobman et al., 1990) . E2 from RV virions has been shown to contain sialylated O-linked carbohydrates (Lundstrom et al., 1991; Sanchez and Frey, 1991) .",

RV glycoproteins purified from virions show greatly reduced antigenicity compared with intact virus (Loo et al., 1986) . This is presumably due to disruption of the conformation of E2 and El during isolation. Bio-engineered El expressed in Escherichiu coli is low in immunogenicity as compared to the native El and does not elicit the production of HA1 antibodies, although it is able to induce a low level of VN antibodies (Terry et al., 1989) . Expression of soluble forms of RV El and E2 proteins in cultured cells would facilitate isolation of antigenic El and E2 proteins for biochemical studies as well as development of serodiagnostic assays and subunit vaccines for RV. In this study, we have investigated the possibility of expressing soluble forms of RV El and E2 proteins in cultured cells that can be used for the large-scale preparation of immunogenic El and E2. To remove the putative transmembrane domain of E2, the region encoding the C-terminal 60 amino acids was deleted by cutting the plasmid with XbaI followed by partial digestion with NcoI. The XbaI and NcoI termini were made blunt with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. ElE2ATM (Fig. lf> was created by replacing the BumHI-Hind111 fragment from pCMV5-E2El ( Fig. le) with the BamHI-Hind111 fragment from ElATM (Fig. lb) , resulting in the plasmid pCMV5-E2El ATM.",

Removal of this domain (TM) should convert it into a soluble protein. Codons for a 27-amino acid peptide encoding the transmembrane anchor of El, located 13 residues from the C-terminus of the protein (Fig. la>, were deleted by using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel, 1985) . The resultant ElATM cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI and Hind111 sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5 (Andersson et al., 1989) and transfected into COS cells using DEAE-dextran (500 pg/ml) as previously described (Hobman et al., 1988) . Forty hours post-transfection, cells were pulse-labelled with 100 $Zi [35S]-methionine for 30 min and chased for the indicated times in medium with excess unlabelled methionine. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitates of RV proteins were prepared using human anti-RV serum as described (Hobman et al., 1989) . Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. The ElATM glycoprotein was not detected in the medium of transfected cells after a 3-h chase period, nor was there any evidence of N-linked sugar processing (Fig. 2a) . ElATM glycoprotein remained completely sensitive to endo H even after a 6-h chase period (not shown) suggesting that transport was arrested before the medial Golgi apparatus. Moreover, indirect immunofluorescence indicated that ElATM protein was present largely in the rough ER (not shown) in contrast to wild type El, which accumulates in a post-rough ER, pre-Golgi compartment (Hobman et al., 1990; 1992) .",

Domains known to date that cause retention of membrane proteins in the ER or Golgi apparatus are located within membrane-spanning peptides or in the immediate proximity. To determine if this were the case with El, we made the construct, ElABamHI (Fig.  Id) that encodes an El protein lacking the C-terminal 173 amino acids including the putative transmembrane region and flanking luminal and cytoplasmic domains. COS cells were transfected with pCMVS-ElABamHI and labelled with [35S] methionine. Following a 3-h chase period, none of the ElA BamHI glycoprotein could be detected in the medium of radiolabelled transfected cells (Fig. 2a) . Consistent with these observations, the 39-kDa deletion mutant protein was distributed in a cytoplasmic reticular pattern characteristic of the ER (not shown). For unknown reasons, we consistently observed that ElABamHI glycoprotein was expressed at lower levels per cell than ElATM and wild type El proteins (not shown). One problem associated with identifying retention signals by deletion analysis is that very often the resultant proteins do not fold properly and are retained in the ER. In order to address the question of whether the cytoplasmic tail of El was preventing ElATM protein from being secreted, we created ElTMCT- (Fig. lc) . The codon Glu 441, immediately preceding the 27-amino acid transmembrane domain of El, was changed from GAG to TAG, such that translation of the anchor and cytoplasmic domains did not occur. We found that the ElTMCT-glycoprotein behaved similarly to ElATM and ElABamHI proteins in that it remained cell-associated in transfected COS cells, and was not detected in the medium after a three hour chase period (Fig. 2b) .

We found that the E2ATM glycoprotein (37 kDa) was secreted in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3a) and contained endo H-resistant sugars (Fig. 3b,  medium, lane H) . In contrast, the 32 kDa intracellular form of E2ATM contained mainly endo H-sensitive sugars (Fig. 3b, cells, lane H) . Digestion with the enzyme mixture (N-glycosidase F/ endoglycosidase F) that hydrolyzes N-linked glycans of the high mannose and the complex type, reduced the size of intracellular (32 kDa) and secreted (37 kDa) E2 to 24 and 28 kDa respectively, indicating the presence of high mannose and complex type N-linked sugars on these proteins (Fig. 3b , lane N/F). To investigate the possibility that the higher apparent molecular weight observed in the secreted E2 was due to the presence of O-linked sugars, immunoprecipitates were digested with 0-glycosidase before and after neuraminidase treatment. The mobility of the intracellular E2 was not affected by the treatments (Fig. 3b, cells) , whereas a lower molecular weight band was observed in the secreted E2 after the treatment with neuraminidase and 0-glycosidase (Fig. 3b,  medium) , demonstrating the presence of O-linked glycans on the secreted form of E2. The slight decrease in the apparent molecular weight of the secreted E2 after neuraminidase treatment indicated that some of the oligosaccharides contained terminal sialic acid (Fig. 3b , medium, lane Ne).",

Following transfection of this plasmid into COS cells, a 54 kDa soluble El glycoprotein could be detected in the medium after 60 min of chase (Fig. 4a) , suggesting that the 27-amino acid peptide deleted from El was indeed the only membrane-spanning region of this protein. RV E2 was also present in the medium of these cells, although in much lower amounts (Fig. 4a) . At present it is unclear whether proteolytic cleavage occurred to release E2 into the medium. Alternatively, the interaction of E2 with ElATM may have altered its conformation such that it was not as stable in the membrane. In contrast, no El was detected in the medium of cells expressing proteins from pCMV5-ElATM alone or from pCMV5-E2EI after four hours of chase, although some E2 could be detected in the medium in the latter case (Fig. 4b, lane 4,  arrowhead) .",

Fig. 5 shows the results of a bios~thetic labelling experiment with one of the stable El-secreting cell lines, CHO-E2ElATM. The autoradiograph was scanned with a densitometer and it was found that after one, two and four hours of chase, 5%, 18% and 28% respectively, of the total El was found in the medium (Fig. 5) .

Viral neutralizing (VN) antibody 21B9H, and hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) antibody H4C52 were used to precipitate 4-h chase media from labelled CHO-E2ElATM cells. The identify of the 85-90 kDa band precipitated with human anti-RV serum (arrow) is unknown. bands (Fig. 3 , RV glycoproteins expressed in CHO cells appeared to be more heavily glycosylated than those expressed in COS cells. Very little E2 was detected in the medium of transfected CHO cells. Golgi processed E2 from CHO cells migrated more heterogeneously on SDS-PAGE than E2 from COS cells. Consequently, it was more spread out and more difficult to detect by autoradiography. Therefore, there may be just as much E2 secreted from CHO cells, but because of the heterogeneous glycosylation, it was not easily visible in the medium. Although 28% of the El was secreted after four hours, approximately 60% of the cell-associated El was resistant to endo H glycosidase. Whether this fraction of El is retained in the Golgi apparatus or on the cell surface in complex with membraneanchored E2 has not been determined. Additionally, another protein of 85-90 kDa was found to coprecipitate with El from the culture medium, but was not El-specific since it was not recognized by two monoclonal antibodies to El (arrow, ",

These assays lack defined specificity against individual structural proteins and it is not known which RV antigens are detected in the assays. Katow and Sugiura (1985) observed that antibodies to El protein were predominant following most RV infections. In contrast, antibodies to E2 protein were relatively more abundant in congenital rubella syndrome than in other forms of RV infection. Thus it may be necessary to use antigenic forms of individual RV structural proteins in serodiagnostic assays. In this regard, stable cell lines expressing high levels of secreted E2 and El may prove to be convenient sources of E2 and El for serological diagnosis of RV immune status as well as RV vaccine development.",

Although E2 is normally present as a member of the heterodimeric spike complex, it did not require El for transport to the cell surface in its soluble form and behaves like previously described secretable forms of viral glycoproteins (Gething and Sambrook, 1982; Rose and Bergmann, 1982). In contrast, ElATM protein was retained intracellularly when expressed in the absence of E2 (Fig. 2) . Secreted ElATM protein from CHO-E2ElATM retained the capacity to bind to anti-El monoclonal antibodies with VN and HA1 properties (Fig. 5) , demonstrating that the protein retains epitopes expected to be important properties of a subunit vaccine against RV. VN and HA1 epitopes on El have been mapped between amino acids 245-285 by Terry et al. (1988) and 202-285 by Wolinsky et al. (1991) . It is probable that this region of the protein may have acquired its native tertiary structure by the time the C-terminus of ElATM protein is released into the lumen of the ER. Whether or not ElATM protein can elicit the production of VN and HA1 antibodies remains to be determined.",

All cDNAs were subcloned between the EcoRI and Hind111 sites of the expression vector pCMV5 (Andersson et al., 1989) downstream from the human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter. The construction of pCMV5-El (Fig. la) and pCMV5-ElE2 (Fig. le) has been previously described (Hobman et al., 1988; Hobman and Gillam 1989). The cDNA (El ATM) was created by removal of 27 amino acid residues encoding the transmembrane anchor domain of El using site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel, 1985) with the oligonucleotide pGTAGTA-CAAGCATITCTCCGCCCAGGTCT.This oligonucleotide is complementary to sequences flanking the transmembrane domain of El but not to the transmembrane region itself. ElTMCT(Fig. lc)was constructed by changing the amino acid residue at position 441 from GAG (Glu) to TAG (Stop) using the mutagenic oligonucleotide, pAGCCCACTACGCCCAGG (the mutated base is underlined). The construct, ElABamHI (Kg. Id) was made by deleting the BarnHI and Hind111 fragment of El(Fig. la). The ends of the plasmid were repaired with the Klenow enzyme and ligated in the presence of an X&I linker (pC7J.J.G TC TAG --AG TAG) with three stop codons in different reading frames. The truncated E2 cDNA, E2ATM(Fig. lg)was constructed by using convenient restriction sites in the E2 cDNA. The RV cDNA from pCMV5-E2 (Hobman et al., 1990) was first subcloned into the EcoRI and Hind111 sites of the plasmid pSPT19 (Pharmacia).",
