The model used field data in eastern Hokkaido where the risk of BVDV infection in cattle has been reduced by an eradication program including mass vaccination, individual tests prior to communal pasture grazing, herd screening tests using bulk milk, and outbreak investigations of newly infected herds. These four activities were then used as hypothesized control measures in the simulation. In each simulation, the numbers of cattle infected persistently and transiently with BVDV detected by clinical manifestations and diagnosis tests and of missed by all of the diagnosis tests were calculated, and the numbers were used as indicators to be compared for the efficacy of the control measures. The model outputs indicated that the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. Under implementation of mass vaccination, the efficacy of individual tests on selected 20% of the young and adult cattle was equal to that of the herd screening test performed in all the herds. When the virus prevalence or the number of sensitive animals becomes low, the efficacy of herd screening test was superior to one of individual tests. Considering the model outputs together, the scenario tree model developed in the present study was useful to compare the efficacy of the control measures for BVD.",

After the designation of BVD as a notifiable disease in 1998, the numbers of BVD diagnosed cases stabilized between 100 and 200 animals per year [19] . According to the results of the latest survey on PI animals in dairy farms in Japan, the proportion of farms with PI animals and that of cattle diagnosed as PI animals were 7.6% (95% confidence limits [CI]: 3.1-16.4%) and 0.12% (95% CI: 0.05-0.25%), respectively [19] . The majority of dairy cattle in Japan are raised in Hokkaido Prefecture, which is an island located in the northern part of Japan. As dairy husbandry is one of the main industries in the eastern part of Hokkaido, some husbandry communities have implemented independent control measures for BVD virus infection in cattle. In Betsukai Town, Nemuro District, mass vaccination using a combination of inactivated and attenuated vaccines and screening tests using bulk tank milk followed by individual serum tests have been implemented since 2006 [18] . These independent but well-designed control measures reduced the numbers of PI detected by active surveillance from 21 in 2006 to 2 in 2012 [29] . As a result of these intensive control measures, the risk of BVDV infection in this area was reduced dramatically; however, the sustainability of these control measures should be a focus so as to prevent the BVDV endemic in this area.",

A scenario tree model of the surveillance program was developed to estimate the probability of freedom from BVDV infection in Norway, with the model results validated by the surveillance program undertaken with a high probability of disease freedom [28] . Another scenario tree model was developed to estimate the probability of the introduction of BVDV to Danish dairy herds by import or transfer or to identify effective interventions to minimize the risk of BVD introduction [14] .",

A scenario tree model for risk assessment is generally composed of three types of nodes, namely category nodes, infectious nodes, and detection nodes, so as to theoretically calculate the probabilities of infected animals being detected at a given level of prevalence. To generalize the output of this model, the number of initial cattle was set as tens of thousands instead of the actual number of cattle in Nemuro. The numbers of either persistent or transient infection with BVDV in each animal category were calculated as a product of all conditional probabilities describing the nodes of each specific categorization and infection pathway. The overall probabilities of detecting and missing cattle persistently or transiently infected with BVDV (BVD cattle) through the monitoring nodes as interventions for BVD control in a default or scenario settings were calculated as a product of the probabilities of infection and all conditional probabilities describing the nodes of each specific detection pathway. The total numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle were calculated as an output of the default or scenarios and were compared to evaluate the efficacy of the interventions in the scenarios. The scenario tree was developed in an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Office Excel 2013), using the software @Risk 6 (Palisade Corporation, Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.), and was run using 10,000 iterations.",

On the other hand, some of the 3-8 M cattle were considered to potentially be TI with BVDV due to a decline of the maternal antibodies to a level that is insufficient for protection. As field data to reveal the duration of maternal antibodies in the calves are scarce, the probability of maternal antibodies being present in the 3-8 M cattle (P ma ) was defined according to the opinions of local veterinarians in Nemuro. In parallel, 3-8 M cattle were set to be injected with the first administration of the vaccine under the adoption of mass vaccination programs, and could use the communal summer pastures. Cattle of 9-14 M were assumed to no longer possess maternal antibodies, and were assumed to be injected with the first or second administration of vaccine under the adoption of mass vaccination programs.

In non-vaccinated cattle and insufficiently immunized cattle, TI cattle would be produced with a probability of transient infection with BVDV (P t ). As there were few field data to verify P t , we referred to the simulated results of probability of transient infection by Damman et al. [13] . P t was considered to be common in all of the age groups, but would be affected by the P p , which was shown in the simulation analysis in Damman et al. P t was set as 25% of P p ; thus, the default P t was defined as 0.1%. Clinical manifestations: All of the probabilities of showing clinical manifestations of BVD were defined according to the opinions of field veterinarians in Nemuro. PI cattle of 0-2 M were assumed to be detected by apparent clinical manifestations of insufficient growth. In the present model, the probability that 0-2 M PI cattle being detected by clinical manifestations, P mp (0-2) , was set to approximately 80%. In parallel, a BVD cow that delivered its calf diagnosed as PI should be detected. The probability that >19 M PI cattle would be detected by clinical manifestations, P mp (>19) , was set to approximately 80%, with a hypothesis that 83% of the >19 M cattle deliver calves in a year. Although most of the PI calves were assumed to be identified during 0-2 M, some of the PI calves would be detected at a later phase, such as 3-8 or 9-14 M as insufficiently grown cattle. The probabilities that 3-8 and 9-14 M PI cattle would be detected by clinical manifestations, P mp (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) and P mp (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , respectively, were set to approximately 40% and 20%, respectively. On the other hand, PI cattle of 15-18 M were assumed to be rarely detected by clinical manifestations since the older the PI cattle, the fewer signs they are expected to show, besides reproductive disorder. Transient infection of BVDV in cattle is mainly subclinical or clinical over a short period. In the present model, TI cattle from the >19 M group would only be detected by reproductive disorder with a probability of 30%, which was derived from the rates of calving in delivered cattle, and delivery of the PI calf as an immature fetus would be caused by BVDV infection over 33% of the gestation period. We did not assume the presence of other reproductive disorders, including conception failure and abortion, as these are also caused by other infectious diseases, non-infectious diseases, or environmental factors.",

In Nemuro, all of the cattle kept at the summer communal pasture are mandatorily investigated for BVDV infection by RT-PCR method using serum samples prior to communal pasture grazing [29] . In the present model, the cattle older than three months were assumed to possibly use the summer communal pastures with a certain probability (P c ), which was changed from 10 to 50% in the scenario models. In Nemuro, independent of the use of summer communal pasture, all of the lactating cows are mandatorily screened for BVDV infection by RT-PCR method using bulk tank milk samples. As this screening test is usually performed over six month intervals during every spring and autumn, cows that were not lactating as dry cows at the time of the initial screening test would be investigated during the latter screening test scheme; therefore, theoretically, all of the delivered cattle would be screened no less than once per year. In the present model, PI or TI cattle in the >19 M group were estimated to be screened with a certain test sensitivity (S eb ) using bulk tank milk once a year. In the default setting, bulk milk tests were not performed (S eb was zero), and this was changed to approximately 95% in the scenario models. Under Japanese legislation, when any cattle in a herd are diagnosed with BVD, all of the cattle in the herd are mandatorily tested for BVDV infection either by RT-PCR or virus isolation method using serum samples as an outbreak investigation of a newly infected herd. In the present model, all of the cattle except those in which BVD was detected by any clinical manifestation, by the individual compulsory test, and by the screening test, were assumed to be tested within the outbreak investigation with a probability of 0.3% (P o ), which was calculated by the number of infected herds to that of all the herds in Nemuro. Test sensitivities of BVDV detection from serum and bulk milk samples were as according to the calculations by Kim and Dubovi [20] .",

When compared in the same vaccination program, the differences in the number of detected and missed BVD cattle between 10 and 50% were smaller under the vaccine programs incorporating a greater number of vaccine administrations. We compared the efficacies of the individual test prior to communal pasture grazing and bulk milk tests under the vaccination strategy so as to estimate which rates of use in communal pasture tests would be equally effective to the screening test using bulk tank milk. The numbers of detected cattle by the bulk tank milk tests under single-, double-and triple-administrations were almost equal to those of BVD cattle in 20, 30 and 30% use rates of communal pasture tests, respectively. In parallel, the numbers of missed cattle by the bulk tank milk tests under these three vaccination scenarios were almost equal to those of detected BVD cattle in 50, 40 and 40% use rates of communal pasture tests respectively. Considering these results together, during the early phase of the vaccination program, it was indicated that the efficacy of the communal pasture test with low use rates would be equal to that of the bulk milk tests, whereas at the later phase of the vaccination program, the efficacy of the bulk milk test would not be inferior to that of the communal pasture test with low coverage rates. We should conclude that the communal pasture test is more effective to control BVD during the early phase of a vaccination program than a screening test using bulk tank milk.",

Moreover, the Norwegian government banned the use of the vaccination for pestiviruses as the vaccination could prevent the manifestation of severe clinical manifestations, but did not prevent the spread of the virus [24] . In these countries, cattle with antibodies against BVDV as potential risk of BVD spread is easily monitored but it can also cull no-virus-shedding cattle which was transiently infected in past. In Japan, on the other hand, we are monitoring virusshedding cattle and adopt the vaccination so as to prevent the further virus spread. According to the results of the present study, it was revealed that the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. This may indicate that, in an area where no interventions for BVD control have been implemented, the adoption of the mass vaccination campaign would be the foremost intervention for BVD control to reduce the number of cattle infected with BVDV. In the present model, herd immunity conferred by mass vaccination did not affect the number of PI cattle, but did affect the number of TI cattle due to a decrease of the sensitive population. Under system of no BVD monitoring, PI cattle would not be detected without showing obvious clinical manifestations, such as reproductive disorder. Given these considerations, the missed BVD cattle under the mass vaccination program would be the TI cattle of any age or PI heifers. As these diseased cattle usually do not show obvious clinical manifestations, it is likely that undetected cattle would be left for a period, thereby allowing the shedding of infectious viruses. Even TI cattle would be a source of BVDV spread, resulting in horizontal and vertical infection over a limited duration.",

            "text": "It is estimated that immediately after initiating the mass vaccination program, the prevalence of BVDV is not low. Therefore, monitoring of infected cattle in parallel with the implementation of mass vaccination should be an effective intervention to reduce the risk of BVD in the population. In Nemuro, an individual test using a serum sample is mandatory applied to all cattle that use communal pastures [29] . In Japan, the use of communal pasture for summer grazing is common in any age of dairy cattle, including pregnant cows; therefore, the spread of BVDV infection horizontally or vertically in communal pastures has been suspected. An individual test prior to communal pasture grazing can detect young PI heifers that normally rarely show clinical manifestations; however, there are practical difficulties associated with adopting this test for a larger number of targeted cattle. On the other hand, the bulk tank milk test can be applied for a large number of animals, and some of the reports have already evaluated the efficacy of the bulk tank milk test [4, 18, 21] . As the target of the bulk tank milk test is lactating cows, this test is unlikely to detect the young PI heifers. Given that adoption of mass vaccination cannot contribute to a decrease of PI animals in the population, the individual test rather than the bulk tank milk test is more effective to reduce PI cattle immediately after conducting the mass vaccination. This consideration may support the results showing that the efficacy of the individual test with a lower coverage was equal to that of the bulk tank milk test in the present study. Comparison of efficacies between the individual test and screening test appears to be affected by some factors, including test sensitivity, virus prevalence, and distribution of targeted animals. Input of suitable data to the disease model as well as collection of accurate data in the field is necessary to reach a confidential output so as to contribute to the selection of a more effective intervention.",

As the remaining PI cattle in the herd are known to be a source of new infection of BVDV in the herd, and may produce PI calves, we should aim to detect as many PI and TI cattle of any age as possible for the BVD eradication in the area by performing screening rather than individual tests. However, if animal-level prevalence of BVD becomes lower, it would be likely that the cost-effectiveness of the screening test using bulk tank milk would be higher due to lower between-herd prevalence. This would be because implementation of outbreak investigation could eradicate the BVD cattle in premises, thereby decrease of BVD cattle would affect to between-herd prevalence but not to within-herd prevalence in infected premises. In the situation of a higher number of herds being free from BVD under a very low prevalence of BVD, we could save resources by investigating non-infected herds while ensuring the sensitivity for detecting infected cattle by implementing an outbreak investigation once the infected herd is detected by the screening test. The decision to switch between implementation of the individual and screening test is critical so as to achieve risk management with high cost-effectiveness. In further analysis, the scenario model with more detailed conditions should be run to compare the outputs both at hygiene level and cost-effectiveness.",

The model output indicated that the adoption of mass vaccination apparently decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. Under implementation of mass vaccination, the efficacy of an individual test with lower coverage was equal to that of the herd screening test using bulk tank milk. Moreover, the switch from the individual to herd screening test under a situation of very low BVDV prevalence should be critical to achieve BVD eradication more efficiently. The scenario tree model developed was useful to simulate the BVD eradication program in the endemic area.",
