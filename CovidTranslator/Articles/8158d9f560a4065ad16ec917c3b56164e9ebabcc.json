            "text": "Molecular biology has significantly improved diagnosis in the field of clinical virology. Virus discovery and rapid implementation of diagnostic tests for newly discovered viruses has strongly beneficiated from the development of molecular techniques. Viral load and antiviral resistance or subtyping assays are now part of the biological monitoring of patients chronically infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and CMV. It will be important to add to this panel assays for other viruses of the herpesviridae family. Qualitative assays for the detection of blood-borne viruses have increased safety of blood donation and organ transplantation. Screening of other blood-borne viruses (parvovirus B19, HAV), multiplexing of detection and test automation to improve practicability and reduce costs will be the next steps. A major evolution in the near future will be the generalization of NAT for the diagnosis of viral etiology in patients, mostly with respiratory, CNS or gastro-intestinal diseases. Major technical improvements have been made to avoid obstacles that still limit this generalization, i.e. genetic variability of viruses, multiplex detection, contamination risk. Commercial offers already exist but menus must be extended to limit the validation and documentation work associated with home-brew assays. Real-time amplification has allowed the development of new NAT platforms but automation and integration of all steps of the reaction are still required to reduce hands-on-time, time-to-result and costs, and to increase throughput.",

One of the major driving forces for the introduction of molecular techniques in virology has been the absence of easy and performing multiplication techniques similar to those developed for bacteriology. The most striking illustration of the power of molecular techniques concerns blood transmitted viruses-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) for which spectacular progresses in the detection and treatment of viral diseases have been made following the introduction of qualitative and quantitative nucleic acid tests (NAT). The recent discovery of a new human coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic is another example. It is obvious that NAT will encourage the development of antiviral drugs which, compared to antibiotics, has been delayed partly because performing efficiency assessment techniques were lacking.",

            "text": "During the last 15 years, many new human pathogens have been discovered among which eight were viruses with various pathogenicity. Molecular techniques have played a central role in their discovery (Table 1) . The construction of cDNA libraries by cloning techniques has been used to identify HCV and hepatitis E Virus. Representational difference analysis (RDA) was successful in identifying human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), and the hepatic viruses GBV-C and TTV. RDA allows the detection of viral sequences by comparing whole nucleic acids sequences in cells from humans or animals before and after infection. Reverse-trancription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with random or degenerate primers has been used to identify human metapneumovirus (hMPV), the virus SEN and the coronavirus associated to SARS (SARS-CoV). Molecular techniques alone have allowed the characterization of very important human pathogens like HHV-8, responsible of Kaposi sarcoma or HCV which induce acute or chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. However, other viruses detected in a similar way are still waiting for the demonstration of their clinical importance. This illustrates the need to verify Koch's postulate and the importance of keeping laboratory competencies for classical virology-tissue culture, electron microscopy and animal experiments-which plays a major role in virus discovery, together with epidemiological studies. Large epidemiological studies are also required to assess the clinical interest of new pathogens. Molecular diagnostics have been very rapidly implemented in clinical virology laboratories following the discovery of hMPV (van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Peiris et al., 2003; Boivin et al., 2003) and SARS-CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2003; Anderson, 2003) . A prospective study on the prevalence of hMPV could be initiated as early as during the 2000-2001 winter, although the virus has been discovered in 2000 only. There has been only a few weeks lag between sequencing SARS-CoV and availability of the first commercial NAT.",

However, there is room from improvement as few contaminated blood units are still missed due to the lack of sensitivity induced by pooling strategies. Cost constraints must also be considered if further improvements are to be considered.

The most striking examples are found in the norovirus family which contains viruses responsible for the vast majority of gastro-intestinal epidemics in adults. HIV diagnosis is also quite difficult to achieve due to its high genetic variability. Gardner et al. (2003) have deduced from sequence alignments that a real-time TaqMan assay should contain not less than nine primer and probe sets to detect with the same sensitivity all HIV strains in a geographically representative panel. To reduce the impact of variability on amplification and detection efficiency, one can use primers and probes with 2 O-methyl bases, degenerate bases or \"universal\" bases, such as inosine or nebularine. Touchdown PCR protocols, in which the annealing temperature slightly decreases during the successive amplification cycles to bracket the melting temperature Tm of the reaction, provides sensitivity even when primers have mismatches with target sequences of divergent species in a viral family. Finally, degenerate primers or probes, with mixtures of the bases found in sequence databases among various species, may be useful to detect all species of a viral family.",

            "text": "It is often desirable to provide the capability for panel detection, i.e. to detect several viruses that can be responsible for a disease. For example, Coyle et al. have described at the winter meeting of European Society for Clinical Virology (Copenhagen, January 2004) a molecular viral respiratory strip for the detection of 12 common respiratory viruses. Whenever possible, consensus primers able to detect all viruses from a family or genus must be used. There are several examples of such consensus primers for enterovirus (Kammerer et al., 1994) , flavivirus (Scaramozzino et al., 2001) or Herpesviridae (Tenorio et al., 1993) . However, their ability to amplify all viruses with the same efficiency must be carefully evaluated. If such an approach is not possible, two different possibilities exist for panel detection: multiplex detection in single tubes or parallel detection in individual tubes. Mixing primers in a single amplification tube to achieve multiplex detection of viruses usually results in decreased sensitivity of assays compared to single tests. For example, we have observed, using a DNA-microarray assay (see below), that the analytical sensitivity of multiplex RT-PCR detection of six viruses, i.e. influenza A, influenza B, RSV A/B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 is reduced by a factor of <1-2 logs compared to single detections, depending on the virus. Nevertheless, this multiplex assay was able to identify correctly 21/22 infections in respiratory specimen (one RSV B infection was misidentified as RSV A; unpublished data). The formation of primer dimers is generally considered as the major cause of sensitivity loss but careful optimisation of all parameters of amplification including primer, enzymes, nucleotides and salts concentrations as well as protocol conditions are required to obtain expected performances. Realtime assays (see below) that monitor signal apparition during the amplification step are also limited in their capacity to realize multiplex detection by the number of available wavelengths in existing equipments which currently allows the detection of three viruses only. Instead of mixing several pairs of primers in a single tube, nucleic acids purified from the original clinical specimen can be distributed into several tubes for independent amplification and detection. Major drawbacks of this approach are the reduction of sensitivity because of lower amounts of nucleic acid available for each individual amplification, higher hands-on times required to manipulate all the different tubes, difficulty to automate the distribution of small volumes of purified nucleic acids without introducing cross-contaminations and higher costs due to the need for enzymes in each tube.",

Seal herpes virus 1 and phocine distemper virus can be used to control NAT for DNA and RNA viruses respectively. Of course, animal viruses which can not infect humans are required.

The most simple real-time detection chemistry uses the SYBR green dye which specifically binds during double-stranded DNA generated during PCR. Several probe technologies (Fig. 1 ) have also been designed for real-time assays like TaqMan ( Fig. 1A ) or molecular beacons (Fig. 1B) in which a quencher molecule is removed from the vicinity of the fluorescent marker upon binding to RNA or DNA generated during amplification cycles. In the FRET technology (Fig. 1C) , two probes, one with a fluorescence donor and one with a fluorescence acceptor molecule are designed to bind adjacent sequences of the amplified material to generate signal (Mackay et al., 2002) . Real-time techniques have been designed for PCR or NASBA amplification and have several advantages which facilitate automation and reduce time-toresult (30-120 min) and hands-on-times. They are performed in closed devices which do not need to be opened to transfer amplified material for end-point detection, thus reducing the risk of laboratory or samples cross-contamination. The use of real-time platforms makes the general organisation of molecular biology laboratories easier by reducing the constraints on activities segregation in different rooms to control contaminations. Table 3 shows existing real-time automates. The next generation of NAT platforms will integrate sample preparation, amplification and detection in a single test device GeneXpert (CEPHEID, USA) is the first fully integrated system which allows the detection of Bacillus anthracis or group B streptococcus in approximately 45 min directly from clinical specimen. Several viral assays based on real-time NASBA on this platform will soon be available from bioMerieux.",

New European Community regulations will even increase this need. It is the role of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) companies to provide reagents which are the results of careful optimisation and are produced according to high quality manufacturing procedures. They have clinical and regulatory affairs departments that conduct validation studies and assemble documentation required to get approval of the reagents. However, even for IVD companies, the conception and validation process is time-consuming and timeto-market may be long. This is especially a problem when a diagnostic tool is urgently needed in case of emergence of a new virus. One possibility to reduce time-to-market is to release \"research use only\" (RUO) assays or assays that have the \"CE analytical\" approval in Europe or the status of \"analyte specific reagent\" (ASR) in the USA. In this case, commercial products that have excellent analytical sensitivity and are manufactured according to quality standards of the IVD industry can be used by clinical virology laboratories, which have the responsibility to validate their use as diagnostic tools and obtain authorization to use them.

Many other infections and especially acute infections for which IgM appear only several days after onset of symptoms cannot be efficiently diagnosed using serology assays. Forty to sixty percent of community acquired pneumonia that require hospitalisation 2 have no known aetiology despite intensive investigation and this percentage is even higher when less severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are considered (L. Kaiser, personal communication). In a recent study, Henrickson et al. (2004) , have shown, using multiplex RT-PCR that 40% of children hospitalised for LRTI are infected with the seven most common respiratory viruses. Similarly, a recent survey of encephalitis leading to hospitalisation in the USA from 1988 to 1997 has revealed that nearly 60% had no aetiology (Khetsuriani et al., 2002) . Absence of specific antiviral treatments for most viruses, which limits prescription of biological tests and weak performances of diagnostic tests based on viral culture or serology are major explanations of this situation. NAT, which have been implemented by many large European hospitals, significantly improve viral diagnosis.

Many biological and instrumentation problems that have slowed the generalization of molecular assays have been resolved but several others remain and need to be addressed. Major im-provements are expected in the integration and automation of NAT diagnostic platforms to reduce hands-on-time, time-toresult and costs and to increase throughput. IVD companies have engaged in development programs to provide clinical virologists with equipments and application menus adapted to their diagnosis needs.",

As the DNA-polymerase progresses along the amplicon, it displaces and hydrolyses the oligoprobe via its 5 -3 endonuclease activity. When the reporter group (R) is removed from the amplicon it is no longer under the inhibition effect of the quencher group (Q). B: molecular beacons. Hybridisation of the complementary part of the probe on the amplicon separates the fluorophore (F) from the quencher group (Q). C: LightCycler FRET probes. Two probes, one with a donor group (D) and one with an acceptor group (A) bind in adjacent positions on the amplicon. The donor group transfers the energy acquired upon excitation to the acceptor groups which generates fluorescence.",
