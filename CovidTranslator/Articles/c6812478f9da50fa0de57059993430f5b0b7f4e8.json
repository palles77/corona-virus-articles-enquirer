Furthermore, most experts overestimate their ability to perform accurately in comparison with non-experts, meaning that experts are overconfident in their knowledge and forecasting capacities. In his review of the work of futurists, Sherden (1998) concluded that meteorologists were not always correct, but had by far the best accuracy compared to economists, stock-market analysts, population researchers, management prophets and social-trend spotters. All of this does not mean that trying to predict or anticipate the future is not without value. From a business perspective, examining the future enables firms to anticipate new business conditions and develop new strategies. From a destination perspective, reflections on the future enable consideration of how to maintain or improve the qualities of a destination and work towards desired futures. Importantly, such exercises should always highlight that in terms of wildcards and trends there are opportunities as well as challenges.",

From 1850 to 1980, glaciers in the region lost 30-40 per cent of their area. Since 1980 a further 20 per cent of the ice has been lost. The summer of 2003 led to the loss of a further 10 per cent.

Finding additional supplies is increasingly problematical since most major oil fields are well matured. Already 54 out of the 65 most important oil-producing countries have declining production and the rate of discoveries of new reserves is less than a third of the rate of consumption as of the end of 2005 2 Reserves of In the last 10-15 years, two-thirds of the increases in reserves conventional oil of conventional oil have been based on increased estimates of recovery from existing fields and only one-third on discovery of new fields.

However, the contribution of GHG emissions from aviation is obviously not spread evenly across the world and instead is concentrated in the wealthier countries from where the vast majority of tourists actually come from.For example, according to Friends of the Earth (FOE), UK aviation emissions represented 15 per cent of UK domestic emissions in 2000. At present rates of growth in TOURISM FUTURES the aviation industry, they are forecast to be 66 per cent of the UK domestic emissions target for 2050. According to Richard Dyer of FOE 'Airlines do not pay for their environmental impact \u2026 The industry screams every time there is a chance the government will do something about fuel exemption [Airlines] don't have to pay the taxes the other industries have to pay'. FOE argue that the introduction of a fuel duty which increases the cost of air travel would then have a corresponding impact on demand thereby reducing the number of flights and the amount of emissions. In addition, they argue that many current air routes in Europe could be reached by high-speed rail links (see London's Sustainable DevelopmentCommission report). According to FOE, on a typical rail journey from London to Edinburgh, carbon dioxide emissions per passenger are 11.9 kilograms, by contrast carbon dioxide emissions per passenger by air travel rise to 96.4 kilograms.However, industry groups, such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) argue that it is wrong to single out the aviation industry for its fuel emissions. According to Anthony Concil of IATA:Are we saying we are going to try and stop people visiting their grandmothers \u2026 We have to look at the economic value that air transport brings to the world. Air transport employs directly 4 m people. It creates $400bn of direct economic output -and if you add in the indirect employment it takes it to about 4.5 per cent of global gross domestic product.We are not against paying our fair share. We are taxed in a lot of cases as if we were 'sin' industries like alcohol and tobacco. But at some point we need to bring some sense to this argument and understand we are not a cash cow that can be milked at every opportunity (in Garrahan 2005: 1).Shortly after the G8 Summit in Scotland in July 2005 a group of travel industry associations jointly declared their opposition to any proposed aviation tax to fund development in poor countries. Airports Council International, the Asia Pacific Travel Retail Association, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, the Duty Free World Council, the IATA, the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) and the Tax Free World Association jointly denounced the taxation proposal. Instead, they suggested that any additional tax would decrease airline efficiencies and reduce demand for travel and tourism, which they argued is a major driver of economic development in many poor countries.TOURISM IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURYThe PATA Chairman Nobutaka Ishikure (who is also Japan Airlines Chief industry Affairs Officer) stated: 'We must remind governments that airlines are not under-taxed, but are over-charged. Airlines play a critical role as a catalyst foreconomic development. Development is a serious issue in need of a serious solution. More tax on air travel is not the way forward' (Travel Press 2005). IATA Director General and CEO Giovanni Bisignani 'slammed the proposal', saying: 'We are not an industry of millionaire customers able to travel at any price. Air transport is an essential part of the fabric of modern life. If governments are truly serious about development, there are glaring opportunities to generate billions for aid simply by removing trade barriers' (Travel Press 2005). Similarly, ACI Director Robert J Aaronson argued that targeted training of a skilled aviation workforce in developing markets was 'far more meaningful than a new tax', claiming, 'Airports are catalysts for economic development by creating jobs, encouraging new business development and building capacity to underpin travel, trade and tourism. Airports have demonstrated their long-term commitment to relevant assistance for developing nations' (Travel Press 2005).The response of airlines to a pilot project, led by France and Germany, for a 'contribution of air travel tickets to support specific development projects' as part of the G8's funding of extra money for poor African countries as well as contributing to fighting climate change was similarly negative. According to a spokeswoman for British Airways, the notion of a tax was 'illogical \u2026 There is no justification for singling out air passengers for an additional tax to fund development in the Third World'. According toThornton (2005: 2), 'she said it was hard to see why aid for a small business sin Mozambique should be funded in part by a family traveling from Glasgow to Malaga for a holiday'. Similarly, a spokesman for EasyJet described the proposal as 'confused \u2026 Why only target airline passen-This case study presents the results of research undertaken between 2002 to 2005 of 43 rural tourism businesses and entrepreneurs in the Bay of Plenty (North Island) (32) and",
