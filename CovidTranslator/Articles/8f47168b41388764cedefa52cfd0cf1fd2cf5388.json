Water-distribution systems, which John Snow investigated comparing cholera cases among consumers of water of two suppliers depending on the site of their water intake from the Thames River. Courtesy University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Public Health. Available at: http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snowcricketarticle.html BACKGROUND The 18 th \u00c019 th centuries brought industrialization and large-scale population migration into cities of Europe including London. One result of this demographic shift was overcrowding in poor housing, served by inadequate or nonexistent public water supplies and waste-disposal systems. In London, the introduction of sewers and flushing toilets directly draining into the Thames led it to becoming an open stinking sewer, due to high tides and strong winds pushing seawater upstream. These conditions resulted in repeated outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, influenza, yellow fever, and malaria, and other infectious diseases, as well as the loss of the fishing industry.",

Since 1817, cholera spread rapidly throughout the world largely due to inadvertent transport of bilge water in ships mainly from the Bay of Bengal. The Indian subcontinent has been a long-term focus of cholera and the source of six worldwide epidemics between 1817 and 1923. The seventh cholera pandemic, which began in 1961, affects on an average 3\u00c05 million people annually, with 120,000 deaths with large scale epidemics in Haiti, Yemen and in central Africa in the second decade of the 21 st century.",

John saw unsanitary conditions in his hometown with a river contaminated by town sewage. As a medical apprentice from age 14, he experienced a cholera epidemic in a coal-mining village. Snow vowed to resist drink, gambling and marriage, and became a vegetarian. At age 23 he began medical studies and graduated from the University of London in 1844. John Snow, a physician now considered a founding father of modern epidemiology was the personal anesthetist to Queen Victoria and founding member of the London Epidemiological Society. In 1848, Snow was developing his anesthesia practice in the cholera afflicted district when he undertook an independent investigation of the epidemic.",

Snow was skeptical of the predominant Miasma Theory, and theorized that the cause of cholera was due to contaminated water as the main form of transmission. In 1854, a cholera epidemic broke out, affecting resident families of tailors and clerks from the shops of nearby Regent Street. The epidemic caused violent diarrhea and very high mortality, with some 600 deaths in one week during September 1854.",

Eventually, the foul smells, popularly known at the time as \"The Great Stink\" from the Thames River flowing past the Houses of Parliament were so severe that the MPs decided to take action. Finally, in 1864 with the plan of Sir Joseph Bazalgette, two enormous sewers were laid along the Thames, diverting the sewage downstream with development of sewage farms to manage the effluent. The system is still in use, but becoming too small to cope with the demands being placed on it as a result of increasing population and land development.",

He was struck by the observation that the cases either lived close to or were using the Broad Street pump for drinking water. He also determined that brewery workers and poorhouse residents in the area, both of whom relied on local wells, escaped the epidemic. Snow concluded that access to uncontaminated water prevented them from cholera infection, while users of the Broad Street pump became infected. He persuaded the doubtful civic authorities to remove the handle from the Broad Street pump, and the already subsiding epidemic disappeared within a few days.",

It contaminated shellfish, popular among the local population, and therewith created a local epidemic that continued to spread in Central and South America between 1991 and 1994. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported a total of over one million cases and almost 10,000 deaths (case-fatality rate: 0.9%) from countries in the western hemisphere in this period. In southern Asia, an epidemic caused by a newly recognized strain of V. cholera, which began in late 1992, then spread to several areas of Central America, Brazil, and Argentina. In 2011, 58 countries from all continents reported a cumulative total of 589,854 cholera cases, representing an increase of 85 percent from 2010, with the greatest proportion of cases in Haiti and the African continent. In 2014, 55 percent of all reported cholera cases were from Africa and 15% from the Americas, the latter clearly resulting from the Haiti outbreak that started in 2010. The case fatality rate for cholera increased by 47 percent from 2013 compared to 2014. In 2014, a case fatality rate of 1.17 percent represented 190,549 cases and 2,231 deaths, mainly in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ghana, Haiti, and Nigeria.",

The most serious complication of severe diarrheal disease in young children results from dehydration due to the loss of fluids and salts necessary for survival. Dehydration is mostly treatable with oral rehydration solutions (ORS), one of the great public health innovations of the past half century, now used globally. Children most at risk are those that have been previously malnourished or with impaired immunity.

Adoption of rotavirus vaccine in routine national immunization programs resulted in reduction of over 85 percent of rotavirus hospitalizations in Belgium, and similar reductions in hospitalizations for rotavirus-induced diarrheal conditions showed the high effectiveness of the rotavirus vaccines (over 85%). In many countries, the vaccine is only partially reimbursed on a per-prescription basis. A systematic review of ecological studies from eight countries reported a 49\u00c089 percent decline in laboratory-confirmed rotavirus hospital admissions in children less than five years old within two years of vaccine introduction. Increasing the use of rotavirus vaccine with proven efficacy and cost effectiveness, along with efforts to improve access to safe water supplies, improved food and sewage management, and personal hygiene will continue to reduce the burden of disease and death in the vulnerable child population where sanitation is still poor. Clean sanitary facilities in homes supported by safe public sewage collection and treatment systems are essential for prevention of enteric infections.
