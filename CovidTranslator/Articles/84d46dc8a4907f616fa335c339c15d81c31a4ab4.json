Antibiotics of the complestatin-kistamycin group have a structural motif similar to that of the peptide core of antibacterial antibiotics of the vancomycin-teicoplanin group though no amino acid component in the chloropeptin-kistamicin antibiotics is identical to an amino acid incorporated in the peptide core of the antibiotics of the vancomycin-teicoplanin group. Chloropeptins and the hydrophobic several derivatives of antibacterial antibiotics are inhibitors of HIV and some other viruses. They interfere with the viral (i.e. HIV) entry process. Chemical modifications of natural glycopeptide antibiotics led to the compounds with antiviral properties whereas antibacterial properties were lost. These glycopeptide aglycons derivatives can be envisaged as potential lead compounds for application as microbicides against sexual HIV transmission.",

Peptide antibiotics and their derivatives or analogs represent a special group of membrane-active peptides. They act by disrupting the structural integrity of the microbial (bacterial, viral or fungal) membranes. The most important peptides, which showed high or moderate anti-HIV-activity in \"in vitro\" models include linear peptides: peptide T and DAPTA (Polianova et al., 2003) , fuzeon (T-20, enfuvirtide), tifuvirtide (T-1249), cyanovirin-N (CV-N) (Reeves and Piefer, 2005; DeClercq, 2005a,b) , ALX 40-4C, the antibiotics polyphemusins and their synthetic analogs (T-22, T-134, T-140) (Rusconi et al., 2004) peptides V1 and enantiomer DV1 and their analogs (Zhou et al., 2002) , peptoid CGP 64222 (DeClercq, 2001) ; and cyclic peptides: antibiotics siamycins I and II, FC131 (synthetic polyphemusin analog), the antibiotics cyclosporins (Tandon and Chhor, 2005) and gramicidins (Bourinbaiar and Jirathitikal, 2003) ; and polycyclic peptides: antibiotics of the chloropeptin-kistamicin group (Tandon and Chhor, 2005) and the aglycons of glycopeptides of the vancomycin-teicoplanin group (Balzarini et al., 2003; Printsevskaya et al., 2005; DeClercq, 2005b) . Several of these peptides (fuzeon, tifuvirtide, cyanovirin-N) demonstrate efficacy in vivo and are currently being used in clinical trials or in preclinical investigations, other peptides are now in development as the potential drugs for cure of AIDS (DeClercq, 2005a; Rusconi et al., 2004; Tandon and Chhor, 2005) . Some compounds such as Alx-40-4C, T-1249, T-22 and analogs, CGP64222 are no longer being considered as potential drugs. Some (e.g. Alx-40-4C) were tested in clinic and failed, some (e.g. T-1249) showed activity in clinic but were discontinued for other technical reasons.",

            "text": "A specific group of polycyclic peptide antibiotics-Nacylhexapeptides (chloropeptins, complestatins) and heptapeptides (kistamicins) (shown in the left column in Fig. 1 ) has a common structural motif similar to that of the antibacterial antibiotics of the vancomycin or teicoplanin (ristocetin) groups (shown in the right column, Fig. 1 ), although the size of their macrocycles, i.e. the framework of these antibiotics, is different. Indeed, the structures of these hexa-or heptapeptide antibiotics and the structures of antibacterial glycopeptide antibiotics and their aglycons show profound differences in amino acid sequence, composition and stereochemistry. The cycle formed with the participation of the amino acids 5-7 present in glycopeptide antibiotics, is absent in chloropeptins (1, 2a) and complestatins (1a, 1b) and is of a different type and size in kistamicins (3a, 3b). In this review the numeration of the amino acids in antibiotics of the chloropeptin group starts from the N-terminal amino acid similarly to numeration of amino acids in antibacterial glycopeptide antibiotics. No amino acid, presented in the structures in the left column, is identical with an amino acid incorporated in the peptide core of the antibiotic presented in the right column. Kistamicins (3a, 3b), complestatins (1, 1a, 1b) contain a tryptophan moiety linked to the central amino acid number 4, connected with the amino acid 4 through the atom in the indole position 6 (1, 1a, 1b and 3a, 3b) or 7 (2a, 2b), whereas a substituted phenylalanine moiety is present in the antibacterially active glycopeptides (4-8) (Fig. 1) . Both groups have a central triheaded triamino-tricarboxy acid 2-4-6, in which aromatic residues are connected through two C O C (vancomycin-teicoplanin series) or through C O C (4-6) and C C (2-4) (chloropeptin-kistamycin group) bonds (Hedge et al., 2003) . Teicoplanin and relative antibiotics have also a cycle formed by amino acids 1-3. Both groups differ in the stereochemistry of the amino acids incorporated: 1R-2R-3S-4R-5R-6S-7S for the vancomycin-teicoplanin group and (1R)-2R-3R-4R-5R-6S-7R for the kistamicin and complestatin group of antibiotics. Complestatin (1a) has R configuration of the C C bond between amino acids 2 and 4. Besides an S atropoisomer of 1a called isocomplestatin (9) was obtained synthetically ( Fig. 2) (Shinohara et al., 2005) . In the chloropeptin group amino acid 1 is substituted by an acyl group (Deng et al., 2003) . Last but not least, the peptides in the left column are not glycosylated. Complestatin (1) rearranges into 2a under acidic conditions (Jayasurriya et al., 1998) . 1 and related compounds were isolated from various soil Streptomyces species. Kistamycins were isolated from the fermentation broth of Microtetraspora parvosata subsp. + kistnae (Naruse et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "Chloropeptins 1 and 2a are equipotent inhibitors of HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein Seto et al., 1989) . 1 inhibited HIV-1 induced cytopathicity and HIV-1 antigen expression in MT-4 cells; the 50% effective doses for these effects were 2.2 and 1.5 M, respectively. No toxicity for MT-4 cells was observed at concentrations up to 400 M. The agent inhibited the focus formation in HT4-6C cells (CD4-positive HeLa cells); the concentration for 50% focus reduction was 0.9 g/mL HIV-1 induced cell fusion in co-cultures of MOLT-4 cells and MOLT-4/HTLV-III B were also blocked by 1 (the concentration for 50% fusion inhibition was 0.9 g/mL). It had no ability to inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity. When MT-4 cells were pretreated with 1 for 2 h prior to exposure to HIV-1, the HIV-1 induced cytopathicity was markedly inhibited, while pretreatment of HIV-1 with the agent did not affect the infection. The results obtained in vitro suggest that complestatin (1) primarily interacts with cells and inhibits viral adsorption to the cell surface as well as adsorption of infected cells to adjacent cells (Memota et al., 1999) . Compounds 1 and 2a inhibited gp120 to CD4 binding (IC 50 1.3 and 2.0 M, respectively), the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 in MT-4 cells (EC 50 1.6 and 1.7 M, respectively) and syncytium formation in co-cultured HIV-1 infected and uninfected MOLT-4 cells (IC 50 0.5 and 1.1 M, respectively). It was demonstrated that 2a was synergistic in the inhibition of the cytopathic effect when combined with other anti-HIV drugs such as zidovudune (AZT), ddI, ddC and nevirapine (Tanaka et al., 1997) . 1 inhibited also recombinant feline immunodeficiency virus with an IC 50 value of 0.5 M and was a more potent inhibitor of recombinant simian immunodeficiency virus, with an IC 50 value of 0.1 M (Singh et al., 2001) . 1 and 2a exhibit no antimicrobial activity against various bacteria and fungi at 1 mg/mL and no cytotoxicity at 20 M for B16 melanoma (Matsuzaki et al., 1994) . They are also inhibitors of the integrase from several related retroviruses (in vitro). 1 was first discovered as a very strong inhibitor of protease activity of complement in the human complement system-hence is the name \"complestatin\" (Seto et al., 1989) . 2a enhances plasminogen binding and fibrinolysis (Endo, 1997) . Some other bio- logical properties of these antibiotics were demonstrated (Kim et al., 2004; Hedge et al., 2003; Seo et al., 2001) .

They are classified according to a variation at amino acids 1 and 3. In the vancomycin type, they are aliphatic amino acids d-MeLeu and l-Asn, respectively, in the ristocetin (teicoplanin)type antibiotics, the amino acids 1 and 3 contain aromatic residues with an ether linkage joining these residues. Several natural glycopeptide antibiotics of this group, such as eremomycin (6), chloroeremomycin (5), ristocetin A (7) (Fig. 1) and others, were not introduced as chemotherapeutic agents but are intensively used in second generation drug design. The rapid increase in the incidence of infections resistant to vancomycin accelerated the search for glycopeptide derivatives active against vancomycin-resistant strains of bacteria. This resulted in discovery of the anti-GRE (glycopeptide resistant enterococci) activity of semisynthetic derivatives of natural glycopeptides containing various hydrophobic moieties. The antibacterial activity of these derivatives depends on the size of the introduced hydrophobic moiety; the optimal size is C 9 -C 14 as linear alkyl type or p-Ar-Bn or the combination of the two types. The most frequently modified positions in the antibiotic molecule are the amino groups of the disaccharide branch, carboxyl group and the resorcinol ring of the amino acid 7 (Preobrazhenskaya and Olsufyeva, 2004) .",

The drug was added to the virus-infected cell cultures at different time points after infection. The compound lost its antiviral activity when added at 1-2 h post-infection. This is also in agreement with the report that chloropeptins I and II interfere with gp120-CD4 binding. Also, the inhibitory activity of 20 against fusion between uninfected MOLT-4/C8 and persistently HIV-1-infected HUT-78 cells (resulting in syncytium formation between both cell types) (EC 50 = 20 and 11 M, respectively) is in agreement with the suggestion that inhibition of viral entry is the most likely molecular event for the anti-HIV activity of this type of compounds. The viral entry process is the result of a specific interplay between viral glycoproteins (gp120, gp41) and cellular (co)receptors (CD4, CCR5, CXCR4). The preliminary findings show that viral entry is a target for the anti-HIV activity of the glycopeptide antibiotics aglycons. It is not so surprising that there is no close correlation between the anti-HIV activity and anti-MSV activity of the derivatives in cell culture. In agreement with these observations, it is important noting that the compounds kept their antiviral efficacy against HIV-1 strains that contain mutations in the reverse transcriptase (Leu-100-Ile RT, Lys-103-Asn, RT, Tyr-181-Cys RT, or Tyr-188-His RT) that resulted in resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It was demonstrated for the eremomycin aglycon Table 3 ). Also, flow cytometric analysis and monoclonal antibody binding studies, and a PCR-based assay revealed that the drugs likely interrupt the viral entry process. The drugs did not interfere with monoclonal antibody binding to the CD4 receptor and CXCR4 co-receptors of HIV. Extensive attempts to select resistant virus strains against several teicoplanin derivatives failed under experimental conditions that easily resulted in the emergence of nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI) (i.e. lamivudine) or NNRTI (i.e. nevirapine) resistant virus strains.",

Several glycopeptide derivatives modified at several places with hydrophobic substituents showed selective antiviral activity at 50% effective concentrations in the lower micromolar range, being not cytostatic at 100-fold higher concentrations against Crandel feline kidney (CrFK), simian kidney (Vero) or human lymphocyte (CEM) cells. Removal of the carbohydrate parts of the molecules usually did not markedly affect the antiviral activity of the compounds. Besides compounds that showed inhibitory activity against both viruses, there were also compounds that proved solely inhibitory to either Fe-CoV or SARS-CoV. Therefore, there was no close correlation between the EC 50 values of the modified glycopeptide antibiotics for Fe-CoV and SARS-CoV.

These observations may point to a rather specific interaction of the compounds with a viral (HIV) factor that is absent in the coronavirus entry process. Moreover, the glycopeptide antibiotics, most likely interfere with the coronavirus entry process, as observed with HIV, it is known that both human and feline coronaviruses recognize a different cellular receptor to enter their target cells (i.e. ACE-2 for Hu-CoV and amino peptidase for Fe-CoV) (Anon, 2002) .

Complestatins and antiviral glycopeptides have important structural differences but the macrocycle formed by amino acids 4-6 is present in both groups, though it has different hydrophobic substituents. They are aryl nuclei of amino acids 5 and 7 in chloropeptins and the introduced hydrophobic substituents in semisynthetic glycopeptides. No semisynthetic complestatin derivatives were studied as inhibitors of HIV entry, whereas more than 700 semisynthetic derivatives of vancomycin, eremomycin, teicoplanin and other antibiotics of this class have been synthesized and their antibacterial and antiviral activities were investigated. Deglycosylation of these antibiotics and the degradation of the peptide core led to compounds which have lost antibacterial properties due to the degradation of the binding pocket interacting with bacterial target; however some of them retained anti-HIV activity. The compounds kept their antiviral efficacy against HIV-1 strains that contain mutations in the reverse transcriptase. As these compounds cannot interact with the molecular target of the antibacterial glycopeptides (d-Ala-d-Ala of the bacterial peptidoglycan), their ability to induce resistance to glycopeptides during prolonged administration may be expected to be very low or even absent. Therefore, these novel glycopeptide aglycon derivatives (but not any glycopeptide antibiotic or the derivative with high antibacterial activity) should become promising candidate drugs to be further explored for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of HIV infections. The glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin, eremomycin, etc.) may be used as the starting material for preparation their modified deglycosylated derivatives (aglycons), which possess definite or high anti-HIV activity and simultaneously low toxicity and no antibacterial activity. So they can be envisaged as potential lead compounds for application as microbicides against sexual HIV transmission (Balzarini et al., 2003) .",
