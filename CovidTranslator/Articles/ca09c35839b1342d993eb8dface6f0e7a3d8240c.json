            "text": "A B S T R A C T Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a noninfectious pulmonary complication after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and is difficult to diagnose. In 41 patients with IPS, we evaluated 6 candidate proteins in plasma samples at day 7 post-HCT and at onset of IPS to identify potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for IPS. Samples at similar times from 162 HCT recipients without documented infections and 37 HCT recipients with respiratory viral pneumonia served as controls. In multivariable models, a combination of Stimulation-2 (ST2; odds ratio [OR], 2.8; P < .001) and IL-6 (OR, 1.4; P = .025) was the best panel for distinguishing IPS at diagnosis from unaffected controls, whereas tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1; OR, 2.9; P = .002) was the best marker when comparing patients with IPS and viral pneumonia. The areas under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for discriminating between IPS and unaffected controls at day 7 post-HCT were .8 for ST2, .75 for IL-6, and .68 for TNFR1. Using estimated sensitivity and specificity values from cutoffs determined with the ROC analysis (cutoff level: ST2, 21 ng/mL; IL-6, 61 pg/mL; TNFR1, 3421 pg/ mL), we calculated positive predictive values (PPV) for a range of estimated population prevalence values of IPS. Among the 3 markers, ST2 showed the highest PPV for IPS occurrence. Based on an assumed prevalence of 8%, a positive ST2 test increased likelihood of IPS to 50%. We conclude that a prospective validation study is warranted to determine whether a plasma biomarker panel can aid the noninvasive diagnosis and prognosis of IPS.",

            "text": "Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a noninfectious pulmonary complication with diffuse lung injury after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) [1, 2] . IPS develops in 4% to 12% of HCT recipients [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , and according to our recent study, the mortality rate by day 100 after IPS is as high as 70% [8] . Current diagnostic criteria for IPS are widespread alveolar injury with symptoms and signs of pneumonia and no active lower respiratory tract infection [1, 2] . In fact, our previous study showed that approximately one-half of the patients with previously diagnosed IPS had viral pathogens detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, suggesting that distinguishing viral pneumonia from IPS is difficult if we use only clinical criteria [8] . Although the evaluation of a BAL sample is necessary to diagnose IPS, the significance of detecting a viral pathogen in the pathogenicity of pneumonia, especially with a low viral load, is not necessarily clear, and bronchoscopic evaluation is occasionally infeasible due to the patient's condition. Therefore, noninvasive blood tests that could aid in IPS diagnosis (an assay that accurately identifies patients at the onset of clinical disease) and prognosis (an assay that categorizes patients by degree of risk for disease occurrence) are required [9] .",

Multianalyte models were developed to determine whether combinations of proteins improved the discrimination between patients with IPS and control cohorts. Analytes were added to the model in a stepwise fashion, selecting the model with the lowest Akaike information criterion value. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was evaluated for each analyte to assess its ability to discriminate between patients with IPS and controls or those with viral pneumonia. Predictive values were calculated using the sensitivity and specificity for the cutoff point that is closest to the top left corner of each ROC plane and assuming a range of prevalence values (0-15%) for IPS. Weighted versions of Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated for high-versus low-cytokine subgroups with a log-rank test to evaluate P values. Because the proportion of subjects with IPS was far higher in our combined cohorts than would be expected in a typical HCT population, individuals were weighted so that subjects with IPS represented a more plausible 8% prevalence of IPS for the survival analysis. Among patients with IPS, Cox regression was used to assess associations between each analyte's onset value with day 200 postinfection survival. Given the limited number of subjects, models were adjusted by the clinical or demographic feature whose inclusion effected the greatest change (at least 10%) on the analyte's association with outcome. A 2-sided P value < .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.3.2 [29] .",

IL-6, ST2, and TNFR1 were significantly increased at day 7 post-HCT in patients who will eventually develop IPS compared with unaffected controls, and only TNFR1 was significantly elevated in IPS at day 7 compared with patients with viral pneumonia. To evaluate whether the biomarkers could improve the prognostic ability for IPS occurrence over clinical criteria only, combinations of multiple analytes were analyzed. ST2 and IL-6 was the best combination for the comparison of IPS with controls both at onset and at day 7 post-HCT (Table 3) . No other marker enhanced the ability of TNFR1 to distinguish IPS from viral infection at onset of clinical signs. We further analyzed each analyte in multivariable models that also included clinical factors that proved to be important in each model (Figure 1 and Supplemental Table S1 ). The adjustment variables included in each model are shown in Figure 1 . At the onset of IPS, HVEM (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; P = .001), ST2 (OR, 3.8; P = .004), and TNFR1 (OR, 3.3; P = .013) distinguished patients with IPS from unaffected controls.

Comparing patients with IPS and controls, ST2 provided the highest AUC (.89), followed by TNFR1 (.84) and IL-6 (.79) at onset (Figure 2A) . Cutoff values identified from the top left point of the ROC curve that best balance between the true-positive rate and false-positive rate were identified as 49 ng/mL for ST2, 5113 pg/mL for TNFR1, and 36 pg/mL for IL-6. At day 7 post-HCT, AUC values were lower, but ST2, TNFR1, and IL-6 had relatively high AUC (ST2, .80; TNFR1, .68; IL-6, .75), and the cutoff values defined at the top left point of the curve were 21 ng/mL for ST2, 3421 pg/mL for TNFR1, and 61 pg/mL for IL-6 ( Figure 2B ). In distinguishing between IPS and viral pneumonia with the onset sample, TNFR1 (top left cutoff, 7033 pg/ mL) and IL-6 (top left cutoff, 45 pg/mL) showed the highest AUC values, although they were relatively low for all the analytes ( Figure 2C ). Because ST2 and IL-6 together provided the best model fit for the comparison of patients with IPS with controls (Table 3) , we calculated ROC curves based on the multiple cytokine models (Figure 3 ). AUC at onset and at day 7 post-HCT were .91 and .83, respectively, similar values as those provided by ST2 alone (Figure 2A and B) . Positive PPVs for patients with IPS compared with unaffected controls were highest in ST2, followed by TNFR1 and IL-6 ( Figure 4 ). For instance, assuming that the prevalence of IPS among all HCT recipients is 8%, a patient with an ST2 value >49 ng/mL measured at the onset of symptoms has a 50% chance of having an IPS diagnosis, a 6-fold increase over the a priori 8% chance of identifying an IPS case. When measured at day 7 post-HCT, a patient with an ST2 value >21 ng/ mL has a 25% chance of developing IPS in the near future, approximately 3-fold higher than the assumed 8% prevalence of IPS. As expected in view of the low prevalence of the disease, the NPVs were high (>90%).",

Because the proportion of patients with IPS in our cohort is much higher would be expected in a combination of the 2 populations, we downweighted the IPS cases to make their contribution to the analysis more representative (8% prevalence). We then dichotomized the patients into high or low biomarker groups using the top left cutoff values from the ROC curves at day 7 post-HCT and calculated survival curves for groups defined by high versus low biomarker levels. In this hypothetical population, high IL-6 (P < .001) or ST2 (P = .002) level at day 7 post-HCT was significantly associated with higher mortality when assuming an 8% prevalence of IPS ( Figure 5A ). We next evaluated the prognostic value of the biomarkers for mortality after IPS.

            "text": "Our proteomics analysis identified 3 potential biomarkers of IPS; ST2, IL-6, and TNFR1. ST2 and IL-6 could function as both diagnostic and prognostic markers for IPS. ST2 is an IL-1 receptor and the receptor for its unique ligand, IL-33 [30, 31] , and was recently identified as an important biomarker of GVHD [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . ST2 also appears to be a candidate marker for the diagnosis of IPS compared with patients with uncomplicated HCT. In our study, a formal comparison with patients developing GVHD was not performed. ST2 did not discriminate IPS from viral pneumonia. This finding indicates that ST2 may be a marker of lung injury, as supported by previous reports of elevated levels in acute lung injury, and plays a role in protection against lung injury [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Interestingly, ST2 was elevated in the early phase of HCT, suggesting that it is also a prognostic marker for the future development of IPS, with the stronger PPV among the 3 markers elevated at day 7 post-HCT. IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to be elevated in patients with IPS [10, 13] . Similar to ST2, IL-6 may function as a diagnostic marker compared with unaffected controls, but not in patients with viral pneumonia [13] . It is also elevated in the early phase of HCT, although not with as strong a PPV as ST2. In the multiple analyte models, the combination of ST2 and IL-6 provided the best model fit for predicting IPS compared with controls both at diagnosis and at day 7 post-HCT. However, in terms of discrimination, the AUC in the combined models did not increase compared with that in the models using only ST2, suggesting that testing for the second biomarker, IL-6, might not be worth the extra cost. TNFR1, another biomarker associated with IPS, was the single best marker in the comparison with viral pneumonia. For the diagnosis of IPS, exclusion of respiratory viral pneumonia is critical, and several obstacles, such as bronchoscopic evaluation in a patient in poor condition or availability of comprehensive assays for respiratory viruses, prevent accurate diagnosis of IPS. Therefore, TNFR1 as a potential marker to help distinguish IPS from viral pneumonia is important, although this finding requires validation in an independent cohort. Etanercept, a TNFR inhibitor, is used to treat IPS, and decreased TNFR1 levels have been reported in patients who respond to etanercept [10] [11] [12] .",
