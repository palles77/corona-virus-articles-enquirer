            "text": "Macrophage foam cell formation by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a key step in the progression of atherosclerosis, which is involved in cholesterol influx and efflux in macrophages mediated by related proteins such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c (PPARc), CD36, PPARa, liver-X receptor a (LXRa), and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of kimchi methanol extract (KME) and a kimchi active compound, 3-(4 0 -hydroxyl-3 0 ,5 0 -dimethoxyphenyl)propionic acid (HDMPPA) on cholesterol flux in THP-1derived macrophages treated with oxLDL. The effects of KME and HDMPPA on cell viability and lipid peroxidation were determined. Furthermore, the protein expression of PPARc, CD36, PPARa, LXRa, and ABCA1 was examined. OxLDL strongly induced cell death and lipid peroxidation in THP-1-derived macrophages. However, KME and HDMPPA significantly improved cell viability and inhibited lipid peroxidation induced by oxLDL in THP-1-derived macrophages (P < .05). Moreover, KME and HDMPPA suppressed CD36 and PPARc expressions, both of which participate in cholesterol influx. In contrast, KME and HDMPPA augmented LXRa, PPARa, and ABCA1 expression, which are associated with cholesterol efflux. Consequently, KME and HDMPPA suppressed lipid accumulation. These results indicate that KME and HDMPPA may inhibit lipid accumulation, in part, by regulating cholesterol influx-and efflux-related proteins. These findings will thus be useful for future prevention strategies against atherosclerosis.",

            "text": "K imchi is a Korean fermented vegetable side dish made with vegetables and condiments such as red pepper, garlic, ginger, and onion. 1 Three hundred different kinds of kimchi are available in Korea. The nutritional value of kimchi is considered high because kimchi is rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Kimchi became a worldwide food due to its functional properties. Health benefits of kimchi such as its antioxidant, 2 lipid-lowering, 3, 4 antitumor, 5 and antiatherogenic effects 6, 7 are well documented. Recently, antiviral effects of kimchi, particularly against severe acute respiratory syndrome, had drawn considerable attention. This antivirus effect is believed to be attributable to the lactic acid of kimchi. On the other hand, an antiviral effect of another product of lactic acid bacteria isolated from kimchi has been reported. 8 3-(4 0 -hydroxyl-3 0 ,5 0dimethoxyphenyl)propionic acid (HDMPPA), with a molecular weight 226 kDa, was isolated and identified as an active compound from the dichloromethane fraction of Korean cabbage kimchi. 7 HDMPPA demonstrated an antioxidant activity in vitro. 9 HDMPPA also revealed preventive and therapeutic properties in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. The serum cholesterol level increase was suppressed and intimal thickness of aorta was reduced in rabbits, and these effects were comparable to those of simvastatin, a hypocholesterolemic drug. [10] [11] [12] The mechanisms of action of HDMPPA for preventing atherosclerosis were involved in modulating the expressions of adhesion molecules and suppression of inflammatory molecule expressions. The protein levels of vascular adhesion molecule and intercellular adhesion molecule at aorta were decreased and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) protein level was also decreased in the aorta of apoE KO mice. 12 Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), known as a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis, is involved in cholesterol accumulation in macrophages by means of internalizing them into the cells through binding with scavenger receptors on the membrane, which subsequently develop into foam cells. Cholesterol accumulation in macrophages is a result in the imbalance of cholesterol influx and efflux. 13 Generally, scavenger receptors recognize modified LDL and bind with it. Scavenger receptors are categorized into scavenger receptor class A (SR-A), SR-B, and others (including CD68). Among them, CD36 belongs to SR-B and is particularly involved in internalizing oxLDL, leading to promote the cellular accumulation of cholesterol. 14-17 ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) are responsible for efflux of cholesterol in macrophages. 18 CD36, an 88 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein, is a fatty acid translocase. 19 CD36 was originally identified as a glycoprotein IV on platelets, but it is also expressed by various cells such as monocytes, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. 20 CD36 acts as a receptor for many ligands, but predominantly binds to oxLDL, and initiates translocation of cholesterol in the cell where it may promote transcriptional changes. 21 Upregulation of CD36 by oxLDL transactivates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c (PPARc) through the mitogenactivated protein kinase pathway, subsequently forming a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). 17, 22 In addition, protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase B (PKB) are activated by CD36 expressions. 23, 24 In particular, the upregulation of CD36 induces the differentiation of macrophages into foam cells, 25 thus initiating the progression of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, CD36 expression is also involved in cholesterol efflux; it regulates PPARs, liver X receptor (LXR), and ABCA1. 26, 27 LXR activation by lipoprotein-derived cholesterol has the potential to not only activate the cholesterol efflux pathway but also to modulate the intracellular distribution of cholesterol. 26 Taken together, these observations show that the control of CD36 expression is strongly associated with the etiology of atherosclerosis. Recently, synthetic compounds such as PPAR agonists and LXR agonists have been shown to delay atherosclerosis by stimulating reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages. 28 Therefore, searching for natural compounds that modulate macrophage functions represents an attractive strategy for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

In particular, CD36 plays a pivotal role in atherosclerosis. 29 Numerous studies have shown that oxLDL generally upregulates CD36 expression, leading to the formation of foam cells. Eventually, CD36 upregulation is strongly involved in the development of atherosclerosis. PPARc is an important transcription factor with crucial regulatory roles in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. 30 The activation of PPARc by oxLDL induces the expression of the CD36 scavenger receptor, 31 of CD36 in macrophages. Consequently, the downregulation of CD36 would inhibit the formation of foam cells. 33 In this study, CD36 expression stimulated by oxLDL was suppressed in KME-and HDMPPA-treated THP-1 cells as a result of PPARc downregulation, suggesting that KME and HDMPPA could prevent the formation of foam cells by downregulating the expression of CD36. Uptake of oxLDL through CD36 leads to activation of PPARc mediated, at least in part, through its content of oxidized lipids. 17 However, direct assay, for example, using a 1,1 0 -dioctadecyl-3,3,3 0 ,3 0 -tetramethylindocyanide percholorate (DiI)-labeled oxLDL 34 is needed to support our results and determine whether oxLDL migration was delayed by kimchi.",

            "text": "PPARa, LXRa, and ABCA1 proteins are known as antiatherogenic factors that modulate cholesterol efflux and subsequently decrease cellular cholesterol accumulation. According to the study of Chinetti et al., 27 cholesterol removal from macrophage foam cells is mediated by ABCA1; PPARa activation is required for the stimulation of the ABCA1 pathway that is in line with our results. PPARa regulates lipid homeostasis by stimulating the peroxisomal b-oxidation of fatty acids. In particular, the activation of PPARa leads to the upregulation of fatty acid transport protein expression and the long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthase (LACS) gene in the liver. 35 Consequently, PPARa not only stimulates energy production but also shortens long-chain fatty acids thereby preventing lipid accumulation. LXRs, another group of regulators of lipid homeostasis, play critical roles as effectors in feed-forward mechanisms that prevent the cellular accumulation of cholesterol. There is a suggestion that LXR agonists can be used as potent agents for the prevention of atherosclerosis. 36, 37 ABCA1 is a member of the superfamily of ABC transporters involved in cellular cholesterol and phospholipid homeostasis. 38 ABCA1 mediates cholesterol efflux most efficiently to lipidpoor apolipoprotein A1, whereas ABCG1 promotes cholesterol export to lipidated particles such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Larrede S et al. 18 reported that efflux of cholesterol from human foam cell macrophages to HDL is independent of ABCG1 expression, but specifically requires the expression of ABCA1, suggesting that the ABCA1 pathway is important for transporting cholesterol from human macrophages. Generally, oxLDL only reduces ABCA1 expression. These findings indicate that KME and HDMPPA play a significant role in cholesterol homeostasis through the regulation of proteins, including PPARa, LXRa, and ABCA1. In the study of cholesterol homeostasis regulation, 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3-ol (NBD-cholesterol) is used to determine cholesterol efflux directly; however, ABCA1 protein expression is also FIG. 4 . Regulatory effect of KME (500 lg/mL) and HDMPPA (50 lg/mL) on protein expression. (A) Western blot analysis of PPARc, CD36, PPARa, LXRa, and ABCA1 protein expression. THP-1-derived macrophages were incubated with or without KME or HDMPPA for 24 h followed by the addition of oxLDL (100 lg/mL) for 48 h. Densitometric analysis of PPARc (B), CD36 (C), PPARa (D), LXRa (E), and ABCA1 protein (F). Western blot was performed by densitometric analysis and normalized to b-actin levels. Percent changes of target gene expression were calculated by comparing their expression levels in cells with different treatments to that in oxLDL-treated cells. Data are expressed as mean -SD (n = 3 in triplicates, P < .05). a-c Indicates significant difference. considered as one of the major and important regulatory factors in the cholesterol efflux mechanism study. [39] [40] [41] The possible mechanisms involved in these processes outlined above might be due to the suppressed lipid accumulation by PPARa upregulation and PPARc downregulation. As mentioned above, KME and HDMPPA enhanced PPARa expression and inhibited PPARc expression. In addition, KME and HDMPPA enhanced the ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux from lipid-laden foam cells through transcriptional mechanisms pertaining to PPARc and LXRa signaling. Taken together, KME and HDMPPA confer a protective activity against lipid accumulation through the regulation of the expression of these related proteins. In our study, we did not investigate other scavenger receptor mechanisms such as SR-A, SR-B1, or CD68, which are also known factors involved in cholesterol influx to the macrophage. SR-A 16 and SR-B1 14 both mediate the internalization of oxLDL to the macrophage, but foam cell formation was only observed in SR-A-mediated cholesterol influx. It seems that SR-B1 also modulates cholesterol efflux. 15 CD36, but not SR-A, is transcriptionally induced by PPARc agonists in THP-1 cells. 17 SR-B1 is able to bind mature HDL and, through a process termed selective lipid uptake, is able to mediate bulk transfer of cholesterol esters from the bound HDL to the cell. SR-B1 is prominently expressed in the liver and other steroidogenic organs but can also be found in macrophages and endothelial cells. 15 ABCG1 is another major receptor that mediates cholesterol efflux. As mentioned earlier, cholesterol efflux from human foam cell macrophages to HDL is independent of ABCG1 expression, but specifically requires the expression of ABCA1. PPARc positively controls cholesterol efflux in macrophages by enhancing the expression of SR-B1 and ABCA1. PPARa and PPARc ligands induced the expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 and stimulated cholesterol efflux in macrophages by a mechanism involving induction of the LXRa. 27 In conclusion, KME and HDMPPA had a protective effect on the cell viability of THP-1-derived macrophages through the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. In particular, KME and HDMPPA have significant roles in the regulation of CD36 and ABCA1 expression, both of which at least partially participated in cholesterol influx and efflux. Based on these results, the intake of kimchi might be beneficial for the treatment of degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular disease by attenuating cholesterol accumulation in macrophages through the regulation of CD36 and ABCA1 expression. Future studies should utilize direct assays for measuring cholesterol flux in macrophages and examine regulatory genes responsible for cholesterol transport to confirm the effects of kimchi. ",
