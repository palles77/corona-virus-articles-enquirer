            "text": "In this study, 418 IBVs were isolated in samples from 1717 chicken flocks. Twenty-nine of the isolates were classified as the Massachusetts genotype. These 29 isolates, as well as two previously isolated Massachusetts genotype IBV strains, were studied further. Of the 31 strains, 24 were H120-like and two were M41-like isolates as determined by complete genomic sequence analysis, indicating that most of the IBV isolates were likely the reisolated vaccine virus. The remaining five IBV isolates, ck/CH/LHB/111172, ck/CH/LSD/111219, ck/CH/LHB/130598, ck/CH/LDL/110931, and ck/CH/LHB/130573, were shown to have originated from natural recombination events between an H120-like vaccine strain and other types of viruses. The virus cross-neutralization test found that the antigenicity of ck/CH/LHB/111172, ck/CH/LSD/ 111219, and ck/CH/LHB/130598 was similar to that of H120. Vaccination with the H120 vaccine offered complete protection against challenge with these isolates. However, isolates ck/CH/LDL/110931 and ck/ CH/LHB/130573 were serotypically different from their parental viruses and from other serotypes in this study. Furthermore, vaccination with the H120 vaccine did not provide protection against challenge with these two isolates. The results of this study demonstrated that recombination is the mechanism that is responsible for the emergence of new serotype strains, and it has the ability to alter virus serotypes. Therefore, IBV surveillance of chicken flocks vaccinated with IBV live vaccines, as well as the consideration of new strategies to effectively control IBV infection using inactivated or/and genetically engineered vaccines, is of great importance.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a ubiquitous, highly contagious respiratory pathogen of chickens that inflicts serious economic losses to the commercial poultry industry worldwide. IBV belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus in the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (de Groot et al., 2012) . It has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 27.6 kilobases in length that encodes four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and spike (S). Serotype and genotype classifications, which are usually based on features of the S1 part of the S protein gene, are used to classify IBV strains (de Wit, 2000) . Furthermore, recombination may be involved in the evolution of IBV, and it probably occurs at many positions within a given genome during mixed infections (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) .",

However, many IBV serotypes have arisen and disappeared in the poultry industry since then (Cook et al., 2012) . The control of IB is mostly accomplished through the use of live attenuated vaccines. The use of commercially produced Mass-type modified live virus vaccines began in the 1950s and has continued to this day. This type of vaccines, such as the Mass strains M41 and H120, are the most commonly used around the world because such vaccines have proven to be capable of protecting against a wide range of IBV strains (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . However, the Mass-type of IBVs is constantly isolated from chicken flocks with respiratory clinical signs.",

In addition, blood samples were also collected individually from birds in all groups at days 4, 8,12,16, and 20 post challenge. IBV-specific antibodies in serum samples were tested using a commercial total antibody ELISA (IDEXX Corporation, Westbrook, ME, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The birds in each group were examined daily for signs of infection for 30 days post challenge.",

An H120-like virus was predicted to be one of the parental viruses for each of the recombinant viruses. This is not surprising because the H120 vaccine virus is commonly used in China. In addition, the nucleotide sequences of S1 subunit of all the recombinant viruses was predicted to be derived from an H120-like virus because all the viruses were primarily screened by Mass type-specific RT-PCR, the primers for which targeted the S1 subunit region (Cavanagh et al., 1999) . Five IBV strains, including DY07-, 4/91-, tl/CH/LDT3/03-, ck/CH/LHB/100801-and Conn-like viruses, were predicted to be parental viruses for each of the isolates. In China, DY07-, tl/CH/LDT3/03-and ck/CH/LHB/100801like viruses have been found to be prevalent in chicken flocks in recent years (Liu et al., 2005; Han et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2012) . Vaccine 4/91 was used in China for many years, although only a few field strains of this type were isolated. Interestingly, no Conn-like viruses have been isolated in China thus far; however, similar to a previous report (Liu et al., 2014) , the ck/CH/LDL/110931 isolate was found to be a naturally recombinant virus that arose from Connlike and H120-like viruses.",

The recombination events from which the two viruses resulted can be explained by two models, similar to that of ck/CH/LZJ/111113 (Liu et al., 2013) . For the remaining three viruses, ck/CH/LDL/110931, ck/CH/LHB/ 130573, and ck/CH/LHB/130598, only one breakpoint was identified. The recombination event may have involved only two parental viral strains with RNA replication initiating in an H120like template of either negative or positive polarity, followed by switching of the polymerase-nascent cRNA complex to a Conn-, tl/ CH/LDT3/03-, and 4/91-like virus template, respectively.",

            "text": "It has already been demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between the S1 sequence, mainly in the hypervariable region (HVR) 1/2, and protective relatedness values obtained in VN tests (Ladman et al., 2006) . In the present study, this correlation was confirmed by an analysis of the IBV strains ck/CH/LHB/111172, ck/CH/LSD/111219 and ck/CH/LHB/130598. However, two other strains, ck/CH/LDL/110931 and ck/CH/LHB/130573, although they shared nearly the same sequences in the HVR1/2 regions with that of the H120 strain, had different serotypes than the H120 strain and vaccination with the H120 strain did not provide protection against challenges with these two strains, as evaluated by tracheal virus shedding. It is believed that only a small number of amino acids changes in the S1 domain are sufficient to change the serotype of the virus and affect cross-protection (Cavanagh et al., 1992) . We compared the amino acid sequences of the S1 subunit and found that a mutation at nucleotide 118 resulted in a change from a G residue in Mass viruses to a V residue in the ck/CH/LDL/110931 and ck/CH/LHB/130573 isolates. Alternatively, it was reported that amino acid differences were responsible for the different secondary structures of the S2 subunit of IBVs, which might result in different interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits and which might affect the conformation of the S1 subunit where serotypespecific epitopes are located, therefore accounting for serologic differences (Callison et al., 1999) .

Birds in Groups 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 were only challenged with IBV strains ck/CH/LHB/111172, ck/CH/LSD/111219, ck/ CH/LHB/130598, ck/CH/LDL/110931, ck/CH/LHB/130573, or M41. Birds in Group 13 were only vaccinated with the H120 vaccine, and birds in Group 14 were not exposed to any viruses and served as negative controls. b Two procedures were used for virus recovery after vaccination/challenge as described previously (Liu et al., 2014) . First, embryos that had been inoculated with individual nasopharyngeal swab samples were observed for lesions. Second, RT-PCR using a pair of oligonucleotide primers, N(\u00c0) and N(+), was conducted on RNA recovered from allantoic fluid of the same eggs. The results from the two procedures were identical. Data represent the number of chicks that showed a positive result after challenge/the number of chicks used for attempted virus recovery after challenge. C Days after vaccination/challenge. contributed to the serotype change of the two isolates in this study, as this will require further investigations using reverse genetic and virus cross-neutralization tests. Based on these findings, we conclude that extensive vaccination with modified live vaccines, such as H120, against different serotypes, in association with the high recombination and mutation abilities of IBV, has led to the broad dissemination of the vaccine viruses and to the emergence of novel serotypes. New strategies to effectively control IBV infections in chickens should be considered, especially the use of inactivated and/or genetically engineered vaccines.",
