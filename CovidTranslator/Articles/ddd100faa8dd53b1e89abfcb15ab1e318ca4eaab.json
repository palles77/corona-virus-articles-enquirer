            "text": "On April 28, 1988, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Aloha Airlines experienced explosive decompression and structural failure at 24,000 ft. It resulted in a dramatic separation of the fuselage upper lobe and made startling headlines like, \"And Then, Whoosh! She was Gone\" (Wright & Tanji, 1988) . The accompanying photos showed evidence of what might have been considered impossible in the past. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) noted that the probable cause of the accident was \"the failure of the Aloha Airlines maintenance program to detect the presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage which ultimately led to. . .the separation of the fuselage upper lobe\" (NTSB, 1989, p. v) . Almost a year later, on March 10, 1989, Air Ontario accident in Dryden, Canada, also revealed a number of systemic factors, including maintenance failures (Commission of Inquiry, 1992a). On June 10, 1990, a British Airways BAC 1-11 experienced explosive decompression when the captain's window blew out (King, 1992) . These three accidents resulted in both an intense focus on maintenancerelated accidents as well as a unique, multiparty collaboration between the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Transport Canada (TC), and the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA), as well as partnerships across airlines, maintenance repair and overhaul facilities, and universities.",

Thus, the early maintenance resource management (MRM) programs, which were essentially CRM principles applied to the maintenance environment, also focused on communication and teamwork among the maintenance personnel (Fotos, 1991; Taggart, 1990) . Pre/post training evaluation tools developed by Gregorich, Helmreich, and Wilhelm (1990) were modified from CRM to MRM to suit the audience while maintaining their psychometric integrity and applied to the assessment of MRM programs (Taylor, Robertson, Peck, & Stelly, 1993) . Similarly, much of the style and content of the MRM training intervention was borrowed from the successful CRM programs as studied by Helmreich, Foushee, Benson, and Russini (1986) .",

Reviews of these three accident cases, along with the knowledge from previous accidents and effects of early MRM training interventions resulted in improved understanding of the maintenance environment, resulted in the beginning of a shift from individual-level blame to systemlevel responsibility, and led to both conceptual as well as psychometric separation of MRM from CRM. For example, in 1994, Gordon Dupont from TC identified twelve overarching issues in aviation maintenance, which were later known as the \"dirty dozen\": lack of communication, complacency, lack of knowledge, distraction, lack of teamwork, fatigue, lack of resources, pressure, lack of assertiveness, stress, lack of awareness, and norms (CAA, 2002, p. 20) . Concurrently, Dr. James Taylor from Santa Clara University built a robust survey instrument to study the pre/post effects of MRM training programs (Taylor, 1998 (Taylor, , 2000a . Through such efforts of various scientists and practitioners, MRM matured beyond a CRM application to the maintenance environment and a clear definition of MRM emerged: MRM is \". . . an interactive [emphasis added] process focused upon improving the opportunity for the maintenance technician to perform work more safely and effectively\" (ATA, 2002, p. 5) .",

For example, the NTSB investigation report (NTSB, 1989) regarding the Aloha Airlines accident cited the failure of Aloha's maintenance program-specifically, inspection and quality control, as well as the FAA's surveillance of those programs, and the human factors associated with maintenance and inspection of transport category aircraft. For the first time, the actual environment in which maintenance personnel carry out their assigned tasks, as well as the human factors associated with repetitive inspection tasks and circadian rhythms, were considered. Of particular note is Dr. Colin Drury's (a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo at that time) testimony noted in the investigation report:",

Further, there is the vigilance decrement during long inspection periods that have low event rates and to some extent involve social isolation. . .such vigilance decrements occur during very long and isolated inspection duty times in which there is a low probability of finding a defect. In such cases, the human being tends to proceed through the task by saying no when a decision is to be made. NTSB (1989, p. 55) This testimony and the NTSB's recommendations were particularly influential in (1) raising the awareness about the conditions under which maintenance personnel perform critical tasks and are thereby susceptible to errors due to human factors issues; (2) acknowledging that the aviation maintenance sector is complex-it has several interacting parties with sometimes conflicting goals or priorities-and errors made at a given time may not result in serious consequences in the immediate future, but lay dormant for a long time before manifesting themselves; and (3) shaping the investigation and reporting of subsequent NTSB investigations-for example, in the case of the Aloha investigation, Dr. John K. Lauber, a renowned scientist and developer of CRM programs, served as one of the Board Members and later John Goglia, an aircraft mechanic, served as a Board Member. Taylor and Patankar (2001) reported three cases that illustrate the purpose, content, and outcomes of the first generation MRM programs. These programs were in effect from 1989 through 1995. Early on, the purpose of the MRM programs was similar to that of the company's CRM program-to improve safety through improved awareness, interpersonal communication, and teamwork. For example, Taggart (1990) reported the following topics in one of the training programs:",

Enthusiasm for this program was higher than for the previous case-nearly 90% of the participants said there would be at least a moderate change in their on-the-job behavior (Taylor & Robertson, 1995, p. 15 ). Over a 26-month period, the program participants reported a gradual improvement in attitude toward change and moved from passive practices (like being a better listener) to active practices (like will not hesitate to speak up) (Taylor & Christensen, 1998; Robertson, Taylor, Stelly, & Wagner, 1995) . During the same time frame, lost-time injuries and ground damage incidents decreased . Thus, there were three levels of improvements: enthusiasm about the training content, individual attitude toward safety, and safety outcomes. Unfortunately, even this program did not continue past the initial 26month run and it had to be put on hold as the management's attention shifted toward economic priorities such as station closures and cost-cutting; soon the excellent results of their MRM program began to reverse (Taylor & Christensen, 1998, pp. 128\u00c0129) .",

Although only 450 personnel (about 300 technicians) were reported to have completed this training, 80% of them reported that they expected moderate to large changes in their behavior as a result of the MRM training (Taylor, Robertson, & Choi, 1997) . With respect to behavioral changes, 40% committed to active behavioral changes as a result of the MRM training and about 45% committed to passive behavioral changes. Furthermore, there was even stronger (compared to the previous case) improvement in lost-time injuries and ground damage incidents. Thus, this case also proved that MRM programs can be effective in improving attitudes, behaviors, and performance outcomes. More importantly, the frontline personnel are more responsive to the training as evidenced in the higher level of improvement in performance outcomes. Again, this program did not continue past the initial phase due to resource constraints.",

The content of this program was differentiated from the first generation programs in two ways: (1) it emphasized behavioral change rather than just an attitudinal change that was emphasized in the first generation programs and (2) it included company-specific cases from maintenance and was directed at maintenance technicians rather than managers and/or engineers. Additionally, there was a strategic differentiation: this program was built on an informal agreement between the company, the FAA, and the maintenance technicians' union. The agreement was that the union would encourage their members to participate in the training program and be forthcoming in their errors so that the company could focus on systemic issues and implement changes that would minimize the opportunity for similar errors in the future. In exchange for such cooperation from the union, the company promised to address the broad systemic issues rather than just individual-level corporate disciplinary action (assuming the error was inadvertent) and the FAA Flight Standards District Office also adopted a broader, collaborative stand recognizing that individual-level disciplinary actions were not effective in longterm improvements in safety. Moreover, all the parties recognized the importance of engaging the erring technician in the safety conversation in order to minimize recurrence of similar errors. The agreement between the FAA, company, and the union was built on the trust among the three individuals (John Goglia, Joe Kania, and Jim Ballough) representing the three parties and their respective credibility among their affiliate groups. This critical risk taken by the three individuals and the subsequent success of the second generation MRM programs was foundational to the modern-day Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) and the Safety Management System (SMS) Program.",

Examples of such recommendations included formal training in documentation for all maintenance technicians. The result of this training was immediate and the errors decreased, but it did not last long (Taylor & Christensen, 1998; Taylor, 1995) . The second-order changes included more structured efforts, but in the form of a control group and an experimental group. As part of the MRM training, the experimental group/station received specific content (awareness, role-playing, group exercises, and tutorials) on how to reduce documentation errors. All other stations formed the control group. The experimental group's errors declined and stayed lower than the control group (Taylor, 1994 (Taylor, , 1995 .",

One of the striking and most impactful features of this program was the introduction of the \"Dirty Dozen.\" Gordon Dupont was at TC at that time and he analyzed a number of accidents and created the list of 12 most common maintenance-related causes: (1) lack of communication, (2) complacency, (3) lack of knowledge, (4) distraction, (5) lack of teamwork, (6) fatigue, (7) lack of resources, (8) time pressure, (9) lack of assertiveness, (10) stress, (11) lack of awareness, and (12) norms.

Although the HPIM program was developed for the Canadian audience, and the first two generation of MRM programs were a mix of awareness and behavior programs, thereafter, the majority of the North American MRM programs developed during 1994\u00c098 focused on awareness and individual coping. For example, in 1996 a major US airline developed its MRM program to create an awareness of the impact of human performance on maintenance-related errors and personal safety. The Dirty Dozen were thoroughly integrated in this program. This program was developed by a team of technicians, supervisors, and the company's training department. Thus, it had broad support and had good instructional design. As a result of this training, over 60% of the participants said there would be a moderate or large change in their on-the-job behavior (Taylor & Christensen, 1998) , which is substantially lower than that claimed by the first generation MRM programs. In terms of behavioral intentions, about 46% of the participants committed to passive changes and 27% committed to active changes. This outcome is also substantially different from that reported in the third case of first generation MRM programs. Given that the training focused on awareness rather than behavior, such intentions were not surprising. On the other hand, statistically significant improvements were found in attitudes about sharing responsibility, communication, and stress management immediately following the training sessions, and they remained stable for several months after the training (Taylor & Christensen, 1998, pp. 154\u00c0155) .",

In spite of the success of this third generation MRM program, the focus on individual-level awareness and coping resulted in \"bridge to nowhere\" scenarios. The original enthusiasm of the participants started to decay as they felt alone or unsupported in their quest for safety improvements, and eventually, they became frustrated and angry at their managers and coworkers for failing to fulfill the promise of the MRM program (Taylor, 1998) , concluding in lost hope for the usefulness of the MRM program in the future (Taylor & Christensen, 1998, pp. 152\u00c0160) .",

This airline worked with its union and the local FAA to develop the MRM training program based on the Canadian HPIM model, but decided to split it into two days that were separated by several months. The separation of the training days enabled the trainers to introduce the various topics on the first day, allow the participants to return to work and reflect on the training content, and return to the training topics for a more applied approach on the second day, when the emphasis was on how to manage errors through practiced assertiveness and awareness of risk factors. Thus, this approach seemed to be a bridge between the behavioral focus of the first two generations and the purely awareness-level focus of the third generation MRM programs. Most of this training was accomplished in one city during 1998 and in another city in 1999. In 1998, the likelihood for voluntary change increased from 60% to about 65% from phase 1 to phase 2 of the training program, while in 1999, the likelihood for such a change increased from 69% to 85%. Similarly, attitude and opinion changes after the two training days/phases showed significant improvement. However, in 1998, field interviews several months after phase 2 of the training revealed that the safety standards and MRM program implementation were deteriorating due to lack of management followthrough. The intentions to change at both cities were largely passive (between 44% and 61%), while the active change responses ranged between 8% and 14%. With respect to performance changes, both cities showed a significant decline in ground damage incidents following the start of the MRM program and the decline continued for about 16 months after the second phase of the training. Taylor et al., 1997) . Again, the third generation MRM programs showed an improvement in participant attitudes, commitment to change their behaviors (mostly passive behaviors, but some active behaviors as well), and a sustained improvement in performance outcomes. Thus, by all measures these training programs were successful. Nonetheless, they lacked continued support and followthrough from management (Taylor, 1998) and they remained focused on improving awareness and passive influence over behaviors . They also did not have clear safety performance goals, rapid feedback of results, and appropriate reinforcement for those who demonstrated the desired safety behaviors.",

            "text": "Around 1999, a fourth generation of MRM programs began to differentiate itself in two important ways: (1) these programs took a systems perspective and expected the entire aviation maintenance system to change and not just the individual technician and (2) these programs had very clear objectivesto raise awareness, change behavior, and impact specific performance outcomes. While these programs continued to build upon the best practices from previous generations, like including the Dirty Dozen topics and incorporating role-playing and interactive exercises, they started incorporating cases involving internal maintenance error investigations. The management and the technicians knew from previous experience and research findings that employee\u00c0management trust was low and improved transparency with data-sharing and open communication would help strengthen the employee\u00c0management trust. Also, one critical investigative lesson learned through the Aloha Airlines accident, the Air Ontario Accident, and the BAC 1-11 accident was that the underlying systemic causes of human errors must be investigated thoroughly in order to develop meaningful, comprehensive preventive solutions for the future. Thus, the fourth generation programs included specific tools for human factors investigations of maintenance errors, thereby translating the awareness of elements like the Dirty Dozen into practical, actionable tools (Allen & Marx, 1994; FAA, 1997) . However, the fundamental challenge of interpersonal trust between technicians and managers, as well as between technicians and the local FAA inspectors continued to challenge the continuation of MRM programs. As a result, the efforts to advance MRM program development and implementation kept returning to the notion that technicians, management, and the FAA must uphold their commitment to certain fundamental tenets: focus on systemic issues rather than individual blame; implement nonpunitive error-reporting system; and follow-through on their commitments. It was known from previous studies that the technicians did not tend to trust others very easily because they tend to be more individualistic Taylor, 1999) and self-reliant (Taylor & Christensen, 1998) . Thus, the fourth generation programs not only addressed individual awareness and behavioral issues, but also gradually shifted toward seeking a deeper, cultural change . Taylor and Patankar (2001) presented two cases that illustrate the transition of the fourth generation MRM programs toward cultural change. In the first case, the emphasis was on individual behavior, regardless of the attitudinal readiness. This approach was quite the opposite of previous attempts to seek attitudinal change first and hope for a behavioral change to follow. In this case, certain behaviors were expected from the maintenance, flight, management, and dispatch personnel. Their emphasis was on a structured communication protocol, called the Concept Alignment Process (Lynch, 1996; , which was specifically designed to expect procedural compliance, integration of risk analysis in tactical decision-making, vigilance and safeguard against individual complacency, and question another team member's decision in a safe and respectful environment (Lynch, 1996) . The key to the success of this program was a reinforcement cycle: prescribed behavior led to procedural changes for flight, maintenance, as well as management; these procedural changes were supported and implemented; the participants' acceptance of the new communication protocol increased and their attitude toward the protocol improved; and improved attitude led to improved adoption and more consistent adherence to the prescribed behavioral protocol, which led to further organizational changes . One of the key performance outcomes of this program was that it not only resulted in changes to internal organizational procedures, but it also impacted the FAA's approved procedures and manufacturer's service bulletins. While the internal impact was not surprising, the external impact brought to light the potential for a broader influence of MRM programs.",

This program was representative of the state-of-the-art at that time. It utilized the available training materials and past practice in terms of the Dirty Dozen topics and the associated case examples, but it also incorporated behavioral aspects such as the Concept Alignment Process and known tools and techniques associated with the investigation of human error in maintenance. Additional information available through the FAA, NASA, and other public domain web sites was also made available. Thus, the expectation was that the participants would continue to build their awareness after the training and practice their behavioral skills taught in the course. Furthermore, the company was also better prepared to act on the systemic improvement ideas that might arise from the training participants. The company management was open to making the necessary changes and keeping everyone informed of the changes as well as rationale for adopting or not adopting the suggested changes.",

As a result, most companies in the United States suspended their MRM programs. In 2003, the FAA funded a different type of project. Instead of continuing to fund research related to traditional MRM programs, they funded a project related the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) in maintenance. This change in research focus was consistent with the internal shift the airline industry had made-it had shifted from the traditional CRM/MRM programs to ASAP programs, which were consistent with the core concept over which MRM programs were built. As presented in the discussion about the second generation MRM programs, the core concept was that three parties-company, labor, and regulator-need to come together and focus on systemic improvement rather than individual blame. Also, by that time, there was sufficient awareness regarding the human factors principles and so the MRM training could focus on event investigation and classification of human error. Thus, the fifth generation MRM programs were in fact, Maintenance ASAP programs, which continued to use the basic MRM concepts (like the Dirty Dozen and case studies), but focused more on the integration of human factors in event investigation methods. However, since the adoption of ASAP programs was much slower in the maintenance community (in 2003, there were only six programs in maintenance; whereas, there were 28 programs in flight), the FAA was interested in learning about the barriers to adoption, particularly if the barriers were related to the FAA's ASAP policy (FAA, 1997 (FAA, , 2002 .",

Consider a report as \"sole source\" if it is from anyone within the company: In the early stages of the Maintenance ASAP program, there was much debate about what would be considered a \"sole source\" report because if it was not a sole source report, it could be subject to company and/or FAA action. To simplify matters, the recommendation from the industry was to consider all reports from within the company to be sole source reports. 4. Try to link ASAP reports from different professional communities to leverage the overall benefits: In some companies, there were separate ASAP programs and ERCs for each professional community-flight, maintenance, and dispatch. While there were several reasons to keep these reports and programs separate, the industry also noted potential to link the reports so that comprehensive solutions could be developed. 5. Follow through on labor, management, and FAA commitments: Since an ASAP program is a tripartite agreement, all three members must honor their commitments, regardless of the political pressures or cost of the corrective actions.

Taylor noted that for the maintenance community, the notion of \"intentional disregard for safety\" was a difficult concept to define, but could be approached with a risk-based philosophy of error management, and decisions could be made on a case-by-case basis. Taylor concluded that the regulators, union representatives, and air carrier representatives responded similarly to the accept/reject decision with respect to the ASAP cases provided to them.

So, members from American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, AAR Corporation, United Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Airlines, International Association of Machinists (IAM), Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA), FAA, NASA Ames Research Center, and Saint Louis University started organizing and holding separate Maintenance InfoShare meetings.

The objective of this meeting was to identify key human factors issues that impact maintenance and inspection actions, and Dr. Shepherd sought to both raise the awareness of the conditions under which an aircraft maintenance technician performs his/her job, as well as to identify research efforts necessary to improve safety in aviation maintenance and, if necessary, make appropriate recommendations for regulatory changes.

Thus, in response to the above recommendations and overwhelming support from the aviation maintenance industry, the Human Factors in Maintenance Research Program was born, and it was housed under the Office of Aviation Medicine. Ms. Jean Watson was appointed the Program Manager. From then on, the FAA followed a structured process of engaging the aviation maintenance industry in identifying research requirements, identifying and selecting appropriate researchers (both academic and nonacademic), leveraging resources from other federal agencies, and disseminating results through annual conferences, published reports and proceedings, as well as journal articles, books, book chapters, software, website archives, and videos. Today, most of the training materials and research reports are available at the following site: https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/maintenance_hf/.",

The subsequent investigation resulted in almost 200 recommendations, including those related to aviation MHF. Thus, Transport Canada (TC) was also highly motivated to develop stronger awareness regarding human factors in aviation maintenance. The year 1990 onward, representatives from TC started to participate in the FAA's Human Factors in Aviation Maintenance and Inspection meetings. In 1993, TC hired Gordon Dupont to develop their HPIM training program and released the program in 1994 (as previously discussed in Section 13.1.3 under Third Generation MRM Programs). Almost concurrent with this development in Canada, and triggered by the 1990 BAC 1-11 accident in the United Kingdom, the UK CAA's interest in MHF also began to grow. The participation of representatives from both TC and the UK CAA, as well as airlines and maintenance organizations from Canada and Europe continued throughout the 1990s. Ultimately, the FAA, TC, and the UK CAA decided to take turns hosting the meetings. The first international meeting was in fact the Twelfth Human Factors in Aviation Maintenance and Inspection Symposium, which was hosted by the UK CAA in 1998 and held at Gatwick Airport. In 1999, the 13th symposium was in Daytona Beach, FL; in 2000, the 14th symposium was in Vancouver, BC; in 2001, the 15th symposium was in London, UK; in 2002, the 16th symposium was in San Francisco, CA; and in 2003, the 17th (and final) symposium was in Toronto, ON.",

Built the legitimacy of Maintenance Human Factors (MHF): Through numerous funded research projects, many serious academics from a variety of universities, as well as the NASA Ames Research Center, were drawn to research opportunities. They developed a substantive scholarly body of knowledge and built the foundation upon which text books and training materials could be developed. The applied nature of research in this field enabled the industry partners to fully participate in the research studies and not only appreciate the value of academic research, but also strengthen it by providing practical guidance and validation. Thus, the research outcomes had both practical significance as well as substantive contributions to the advancement of the state of knowledge in the field of MHF. Additionally, two of the most critical appointments that could be directly attributed to the success of the MHF program were as follows: a. The various MRM programs implemented at the participating airlines and repair stations achieved numerous changes to maintenance tasks, organizational procedures (like maintenance manuals updates), and industry-wide best practices (like nonpunitive error-reporting policies). At the national and international levels, the reports and recommendations from various research projects and conversations at the symposia contributed toward the development of the following legislative changes: a. Canadian Aviation Regulations, Subpart 7: SMSs. In 1999, TC began its journey toward system-wide implementation of SMS programs by first developing an overall framework for the entire Canadian aviation industry. It was published as, Flight 2005: A Civil Aviation Safety Framework for Canada (Transport Canada, 1999) . Canada became the first country in the world to regulate the implementation of SMS in the aviation industry, but took a phased approach to building awareness through guidance materials and progressive phase-in requirements across all the industry sectors (flight operations, maintenance, design, airports, etc.). Subsequently, in Flight 2010, TC increased the emphasis on risk-based decision-making (Transport Canada, 2006 ",

As illustrated in Table 13 .2, each phase builds upon the awareness developed in the preceding phase and adds a behavioral or skill development component to it. While the broad categories of emphasis remain fairly stable, the specific topics, exercises, case studies, etc. vary. However, they all strive to achieve the learning objectives stated by ICAO (see Table 13 .1). Three delivery styles have been used: In the United States, MRM training programs were received very well by the frontline maintenance personnel. The general pattern of scores on attitudinal survey items indicated an improvement soon after training, stable scores even one year after the training, but a decline thereafter and a shift toward negative scores thereafter. Subsequent interviews with the participating personnel indicated that while they were enthused during the training and remained optimistic that their colleagues and supervisors would implement appropriate changes to their work environment (consistent with the human factors elements discussed in the MRM training), they were disappointed because they did not see significant follow-through from their management.",

For example, stress management was a key topic in these MRM programs-the participants must have taken most positively to this aspect of the training because they showed the greatest improvement in attitude toward stress management and this improvement was most positively correlated with decline in losttime injuries as well as ground damage (Taylor, 1998) .

With respect to the MRM programs, the participants seemed to be very motivated to learn and transfer (as indicated by the posttraining attitudinal scores), but the organizational climate for transfer of training was not always conducive to realize the full potential of the MRM training (as evidenced by the interview data that claimed lack of management follow-through). Thus, future implementation of MRM programs might benefit from Sitzman and Weinhardt's (2015) training engagement theory, which advocates for continuous assessment of engagement and commitment from multiple levels of the organization so that there is an ongoing attention to the training and multilevel vested interest in the training program's success.",

It is not surprising that this increased emphasis on individual-level accountability, as a part of professionalism, has given rise to the importance of interpersonal trust as a matter of mutual accountability.

Thus, interpersonal trust and open communication tend to be mutually-supportive properties. Patankar, Taylor, and Goglia (2002) studied interpersonal trust across five maintenance organizations and discovered that one-third of the mechanics did not trust that their supervisor would act in the interest of safety. The significance of interpersonal trust began to emerge in fourth generation MRM programs and grew stronger in the fifth and sixth generation programs. In the early stages (fourth generation), the realization of the significance of interpersonal trust was limited to co-workers and employee\u00c0 management relationship. As the MRM programs continued to mature through the fifth generation, the notion of interpersonal trust became foundational to the sustainability of MRM programs, and in the sixth generation programs, the level of trust expected from co-workers, managers, regulators, and industry-wide colleagues has set a new high standard without which incorporation of programs like ASAP and LOSA, and predictive analytics available due to sharing of safety data, would be impossible. Hofstede (1984) , through his landmark study of IBM workers around world, classified work values of different people. Those who were more inclined to value group harmony or community goals over individual autonomy were classified as \"collectivistic,\" and those that valued individual autonomy over group or community harmony were classified as \"individualistic.\" Hofstede noted that the individualistic versus collectivistic differentiation mapped very well across national boundaries-people from western countries were more individualistic than those from eastern or South American countries. This study laid the foundation for classification of cultures based on national boundaries. Helmreich and Merritt (1998) called such differentiation \"national culture\" and built on the underlying concepts across professional and organizational boundaries to define \"professional culture\" and \"organizational culture.\" Helmreich and Merritt applied Hofstede's individualistic versus collectivistic measure to airline pilots and surgeons and discovered that the surgeons were more individualistic than Hofstede's original sample of IBM workers and that the pilots were more individualistic than the surgeons. When Taylor (1999) conducted a similar study of aircraft maintenance technicians, he discovered that the technicians were more individualistic than pilots. Thus, on the continuum of individualism-through-collectivism, aircraft maintenance technicians tend to be the most individualistic, which is quite the opposite of the goals of MRM programs. Therefore, in order for MRM programs to be effective in improving interpersonal communication and teamwork, they must place greater emphasis on behavior modeling and skills training. In terms of cross-national implications, subsequent studies Patankar, 1999; have noted that while the North American MRM training transitions well to Asian audiences, the assertiveness scores increased more significantly in Taiwan and India. Therefore, a typical North American MRM training could be used in more collectivistic national cultures, but certain populations may respond differently to the modules related to assertiveness.",

            "text": "In the United States, the implementation of MRM training has been voluntary. Thus, most companies needed to demonstrate a positive return-oninvestment in order to offer such programs and make them part of the broader safety strategy. The FAA has provided a basic return-on-investment calculator tool (FAA, 2017b) . This tool provides a good way to generate an initial estimate of the ROI to be expected from an MRM program. However, while it accommodates for a less than 100% probability of success with the MRM program (training may not achieve 100% of its goals), it does not accommodate for other concurrent or recently completed safety initiatives that might influence the overall safety performance outcome. In order to objectively measure the financial impact of MRM training, while giving credit to non-MRM safety initiatives that might have been concurrently or previously supported, Taylor (2000b) presented a formula that distills the effects of MRM instruction for a realistic assessment of return-on-investment from MRM training alone. In this formula, a \"causal operator\" is used as a multiplier (between 0 and 1) to appropriately right-size the estimated ROI. The actual value of this causal operator is based on the pre/post comparison of change in participant attitudes resulting from an MRM training program. Thus, if there was a 30% improvement in participant attitudes after the MRM training, the training program could take credit for only 30% of the total ROI. Patankar and Taylor (2004a) presented two examples to illustrate that substantial positive ROI is possible from expensive MRM programs that affect \"high value\" outcomes (such as the lost-time injuries example). Also, at times, MRM programs may be successful at improving safety outcomes, but not result in a positive ROI. Therefore, it is important to plan and design one's MRM program to impact the specific targets and their associated ROI. Lercel, Steckel, Mondello, Carr, and Patankar (2011) classify ROI analysis in terms of three levels: micro, mid, and macro. According to this classification, the type of analysis suggested by the FAA and Taylor (as discussed in the preceding paragraph), would be regarded as micro-level analysis. At the next higher level, the analysis shifts to company-wide safety programs. Thus, the analysis of a company-wide SMS program, which may include programs like MRM, CRM, and LOSA, as well as implementation across number of locations, would be considered a mid-level tier of ROI analysis. Although Lercel et al. did not report any mid-level examples from the aviation industry, they presented compelling examples from construction and pharmaceutical industries to illustrate both company-wide benefits of safety programs as well as risks of a safety-related failure. At the macro level of analysis, Lercel et al. illustrated the devastating effects of safety incidents (even those with a relatively benign or positively heroic outcome) on company stock prices-essentially, companies could lose substantial market value as a result of a safety incident, regardless of the actual outcome (in terms of loss of life/property).",

This approach presents all the safety programs combined into one, comprehensive investment, much like a mutual fund with respect to financial investments. Such a portfolio-based approach fundamentally shifts the notion of safety programs from \"costs\" to \"investments\"; brings top management interest by connecting safety program success with corporate financial success; enables longer-term outlook by considering the overall impact of all safety programs rather than financial benefits of discrete programs; leverages the benefits of multiple, concurrent programs; and accommodates short-term negative returns from one or two individual programs.",

One could argue that in the early years of MRM programs, the shared experience of aircraft maintenance engineers/technicians revolved around blame. Accident/incident investigations focused on \"who\" made the mistake and the corrective actions were largely punitive to the individual responsible for the mistake. Thus, theoretically, if one had to change this blame-oriented culture in aviation maintenance, it was essential to create a different shared experience. While they may not have realized it at the time, the founders of the second generation MRM programs-John Goglia, Jim Ballough, and Joe Kania-knew from personal experience that the technician who made the mistake was most knowledgeable about the circumstances leading up to the mistake and therefore needed some degree of protection from disciplinary action so that he/she could help prevent similar errors in the future. As the second generation programs went through implementation and the three parties-company, FAA, and the uniondemonstrated that they could uphold their mutual agreement, all three parties created a new shared experience. Over time, repeated and consistent emphasis on nonpunitive error management helped move the aviation maintenance community away from blame-oriented culture. However, it took almost a decade for this cultural shift to be institutionalized as a formal, replicable process: it came in the form of ASAP programs as part of the fifth generation MRM programs. Thus, today, the artifact that illustrates the shift from a blame culture to a reporting or just culture within a particular organization is the ASAP agreement between labor, management, and the regulator. The claim that such cultural shift is a national phenomenon is supported by the rise in Maintenance ASAP programs from 6 to 168 from 2003 to 2017.",

Also, the Aviation Accreditation Board International (AABI; the accrediting body of collegiate aviation programs) has included the requirement for a robust safety management program in all AABI-accredited aviation colleges/universities. Thus, the MRM research efforts that were initiated in the United States have contributed toward a policy-and practice-level impact across the globe, and they have penetrated many of the premier collegiate programs so that the future maintenance technicians will enter the industry with sufficient knowledge, appropriate attitude, and essential skills to practice behaviors consistent with the expectations of a just safety culture.",

Trigger events like the three seminal accident cases-Aloha Airlines, Air Ontario, and British Airways BAC 1-11-challenged the prevailing unquestioned assumptions about the maintenance environment, practices, and personal vulnerabilities. The resultant accident investigations also played a critical role in shifting the mindset from individual-level blame to system-level responsibility. Thus, when MRM programs were created and implemented, they offered an alternate shared experience to the maintenance personnel, management, and regulators. As each party learned from the new experience and held steadfast on their mutual commitment, the old assumptions melted away, interpersonal trust improved, shared values changed, and workplace performance outcomes improved. Both internal and external leaders (people who held formal positions) and influencers (people who did not hold direct operational responsibilities) played their part in shaping the interventions, providing objective feedback from the success and challenges in implementing the interventions, and developing reports and training materials. Holistically, an intricate web of social systems, comprising of individuals, corporations, labor unions, universities, and government agencies, achieved a fundamental shift in shared values across the global aviation industry. This is not to say that the process was flawless or the experience was without challenges and setbacks; nonetheless, people persevered, adapted to the changing fiscal, geopolitical, and regulatory constraints, and in some cases passed on the responsibilities to their successors to continue the core pursuit.",

By setting the trigger on an \"event\" rather than an accident or incident, the MEDA process encouraged review of all undesirable outcomes. Also, it allowed the operators to track events that were important to them. Examples of such events included flight cancellation, gate return, and inflight engine shut-down. All the events were associated with actual cost incurred by the air carrier (although the cost varied by company), and therefore the process encouraged the users to consider financial implications of both the errors as well as the solutions. In the decision phase, the operator is expected to determine whether or not the event was maintenance-related; only if it was maintenancerelated, the operator would use the MEDA process further to conduct the investigation. The predeveloped MEDA form guided the investigators in determining the underlying causes of the event and enabled them to determine whether the event occurred due to an error or a violation. According to MEDA, an error is an unintentional human error and a violation is an intentional human action; maintenance-related events can be caused by either errors, violations, or a combination of the two. MEDA also allowed the investigators to consider appropriate prevention strategies. Finally, the feedback phase was intended to communicate back to the workforce the nature of the event, results of the investigation, and strategies to be employed to prevent similar events in the future. As of 2007, Boeing claimed that over 500 of its customer organizations have used MEDA training, and the outcomes ranged from a 16% reduction in delays due to maintenance to 48% reduction in operationally significant events. Thus, MEDA has proven to be an effective tool to mitigate lower-level events and thereby reduce the risk of higher-consequence events (assuming that the contributing factors for both levels of consequences are similar or the same).",

One of the core principles of the HFACS-ME model is that accidents are a combination of latent conditions and active failures; thus, in order to develop long-term preventive measures, one should address the latent conditions. Latent conditions and active failures are classified into four broad categories: unsafe management conditions, unsafe maintainer conditions, unsafe working conditions, and unsafe acts of the maintainer. As a result of this approach, it is likely that any given investigation will reveal latent conditions that could contribute to other undesirable events in the future. Schmidt et al. (2001) analyzed 15 NTSB accident reports and discovered that 100% of them reported unsafe management conditions, 73% reported unsafe maintainer conditions, 67% reported unsafe working conditions, and with respect to unsafe maintainer acts, 87% reported errors (unintentional human error) and 47% reported violations (intentional risky or illegal actions).",

For example, the first contributing factor listed in MEDA is \"Information.\" While filling out a MEDA report, the investigator must consider various questions related to information and then fill out a narrative response.

Thus, when there is an eminent safety risk and a threat, but the threat is not managed effectively to contain the risk, it will result in an undesirable event. If the threat is managed within acceptable limits, the underlying data will provide some opportunities for analysis regarding whether or not broader risk management strategies need to be developed. Ployhart, Hale, and Campion (2014) reviewed a number of definitions of culture and concluded that they converge on three dimensions: (1) artifacts, (2) values and beliefs, and (3) underlying assumptions, which are consistent with Schein's theory of organizational culture (1988, 2010, 2015) . Hofstede's (1984) work focuses on shared values and has been used most commonly for studies involving cultural comparisons. Helmreich and Merritt (1998) extended the use of values-based differentiation to categorize groups of people in accordance with national boundaries (national culture), organizational boundaries (organizational culture), and professional boundaries (professional culture). Thus, Hofstede's comparative scales such as individualism versus collectivism or power distance could be used in the context of different national groups, organizational groups, or professional groups. With respect to safety culture, the key shared value is safety. Thus, safety culture is a focused study of organizational culture. Therefore, in order to examine the influence of MRM programs on the safety culture in technical operations, one needs to focus on how the shared values and beliefs were influenced, how the underlying assumptions might have changed as a result of the MRM programs, and what specific artifacts were created to memorialize the changes in shared values and beliefs.",

In the case of technical operations, maintenance personnel had experienced a blameoriented culture wherein it was common for error investigations to focus on the person who might have committed the error rather than addressing latent issues in the system. Thus, the maintenance community had learned to not speak up or maintain their personal notes on how to prevent errors. However, certain key leaders knew that in order to address the challenge of maintenance errors, they needed to earn the trust of their maintenance personnel and engage them in solving the system problems. Therefore, when John Goglia, Joe Kania, and Jim Ballough decided to work together to address this issue, they took the foundational step toward changing the shared experiences of maintenance personnel and thereby setting in motion the long journey toward a sustainable cultural change in aviation maintenance. At that time, a deeper, underlying assumption in the maintenance community was that if the technician was forthright in admitting his/her mistake, he/she would be subject to not only corporate disciplinary action, but also to a certificate action by the FAA. Thus, it was essential for both the company and the FAA to provide the technician with consistent protection while not making the protection serve like a \"get out of jail free\" card (full amnesty). This approach was also foundational to today's notion of a just culture, wherein there is a clear separation between inadvertent errors and intentional disregard for safety; the latter is punishable. Reflecting on how the culture in technical operations matured over the six generations of MRM programs, it is clear that the shared experience of the technicians, managers, and the regulators must have changed, which eventually led to the development of formal tripartite agreements among company, union and the FAA. Once these agreements started to be formalized and supported, the subsequent shared experiences served to reinforce the shared organizational values regarding safety, nonpunitive reporting, and just culture.",

Violation of any one of these behaviors constituted negligent behavior and hence the individual did not receive amnesty, bringing about a balance between accountability and benevolence (Patankar and Baines, 2003) .

As noted in the preceding sections, the various generations of MRM programs have aimed at both improving awareness and changing individual behavior. While some programs had specific behavioral change goals directed at addressing problems like documentation errors, others simply assumed that a change in awareness would translate into change in behaviors and ultimately into change in performance outcomes such as reduction in ground damage or lost-time injuries. For the most part, however, the planned aspect of the program was limited to individual-level awareness or individual-level change in behavior. Furthermore, most programs were successful in achieving passive behavioral changes suggested by their increased self-awareness regarding human performance issues, but not active changes in the sense that the participants were not overtly committed to doing anything different such as implementing mitigation measures to counter fatigue, distractions, stress, etc. In the future, interventions involving training programs could consider comprehensive models of training evaluation like Alvarez et al.'s (2004) integrated model of training evaluation and training effectiveness as well as Spitzer's (2005) Learning Effectiveness Measurement (LEM) methodology, which take a more active stance on transfer of learning into workplace behaviors and incorporate the role of extant organizational culture. Such an approach would not only make MRM-like training interventions more effective in achieving their outcomes, but also enable the managers (frontline through senior management) to be better prepared to support the organizational changes emanating from the implementation of the training intervention.",

Thus, one could argue that the training intervention serves as a specially designed shared experience, which could employ Spitzer's LEM, with specific operational goals as well as valuebased goals. Birdi and Reid's (2013) Taxonomy of Training and Development Outcomes would be particularly helpful in formulating training outcome goals at the individual-, group-, organization-, as well as the entire aviation industry-level. 13.6.5 Artifacts Schein (1988) defines artifacts as manifestations of the underlying culture and hence they can take the form of language, symbols, stories, as well as implementation mechanisms like policies and procedures.

Almost concurrent with these symposia the previously successful CRM training was adapted to the maintenance environment and the first generation of MRM training program was launched.
