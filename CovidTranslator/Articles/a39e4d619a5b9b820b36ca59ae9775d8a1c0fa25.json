Currently, there are only a few DNMT1 inhibitors with potential application as therapeutic agents or research tools. 5,5-Methylenedisalicylic acid is a novel scaffold previously identified by virtual screening with detectable although weak inhibitory activity of DNMT1 in biochemical assays. Herein, we report enzyme inhibition of a structurally related compound, trimethylaurintricarboxylic acid (NSC97317) that showed a low micromolar inhibition of DNMT1 (IC 50 =4.79 \u03bcM). Docking studies of the new inhibitor with the catalytic domain of DNMT1 suggest that NSC97317 can bind into the catalytic site. Interactions with amino acid residues that participate in the mechanism of DNA methylation contribute to the binding recognition. In addition, NSC97317 had a good match with a structurebased pharmacophore model recently developed for inhibitors of DNMT1. Trimethylaurintricarboxylic acid can be a valuable biochemical tool to study DNMT1 inhibition in cancer and other diseases related to DNA methylation.",

DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs) mediate this process. To date, three types of DNMTs have been identified in the human genome, including the two de novo methyltransferases (DNMT3A and DNMT3B) and the maintenance methyltransferase (DNMT1), which is the most abundant among the three [1] [2] [3] . DNMT1 is responsible for duplicating the pattern of DNA methylation during replication, it is essential for proper mammalian development, and it has been proposed as the more interesting target for experimental cancer therapies [4] . DNA methylation represents a central mechanism for mediating epigenetic gene regulation. Thus, the development of DNMT inhibitors provides novel opportunities for cancer therapy [1, [5] [6] [7] . It is worth nothing that epigenetic alterations are not only associated with cancer but also with psychiatric and other diseases [8] [9] [10] .",

The mechanism of DNA cytosine-C5 methylation is schematically depicted in Fig. 1 [4, 14, 15] . DNMT forms a complex with DNA and the cytosine which will be methylated flips out from the DNA. The thiol of the catalytic cysteine acts as a nucleophile that attacks the 6position of the target cytosine to generate a covalent intermediate. The 5-position of the cytosine is activated and conducts a nucleophilic attack on the cofactor Sadenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to form the 5-methyl covalent adduct and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). The attack on the 6-position is assisted by a transient protonation of the cytosine ring at the endocyclic nitrogen atom N3, which is stabilized by a glutamate residue. An arginine residue may participate in the stabilization of the intermediate making a hydrogen bonding interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of cytosine. The covalent complex between the methylated base and the DNA is resolved by deprotonation at the 5-position to generate the methylated cytosine and the free enzyme.",

Moreover, in an independent virtual screening, the aurintricarboxylic acid (which is a structural analogue of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid) was identified as a highly potent inhibitor of the methyltransferase activities on flaviviral methyltransferases [27] .

The inhibition of the enzymatic activity of DNMT1 was tested using the HotSpot SM platform for methyltransferase assays available at Reaction Biology Corporation [30] . HotSpot SM is a low volume radioisotopebased assay which uses tritium-labeled AdoMet ( 3 H-SAM) as a methyl donor. NSC97317 diluted in DMSO was added by using acoustic technology (Echo550, Labcyte) into enzyme/substrate mixture in nano-liter range. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 3 H-SAM, and incubated at 30\u00b0C. Total final methylations on the substrate (Poly(dI-dC)) were detected by a filter binding approach. Data analysis was performed using Graphed Prism software (La Jolla, CA) for curve fits. Reactions were carried out at 1 \u03bcM of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). S-adenosyl-Lhomocysteine (SAH) is used as standard positive control in these assays. NSC97317 was tested in 10-dose IC 50 (effective concentration to inhibit DNMT1 activity by 50%) with three-fold serial dilution starting at 100 \u03bcM.",

Despite the fact that a recent crystallographic structure for human DNMT1 has been recently published (vide infra), the structure corresponds to the enzyme bound to unmethylated DNA and this structure it is not suitable to model small-molecule inhibitors of DNMT1. This is because in the crystallographic structure the catalytic loop has an open conformation and the catalytic cysteine is far from the binding site (more than 9 \u00c5) [32] . Therefore, the geometry of the catalytic site does not represent the catalytic mechanism of DNA methylation. Briefly, to build the homology model, the catalytic domain of the human DNMT1 was taken from the UniProt (UniProt ID: P26358) [33] . The DNMT1 sequence was aligned based on the sequence of DNA methyltransferases M.HhaI (PDB ID: 6MHT), M.HaeIII (PDB ID: 1DCT) and DNMT2 (PDB ID: 1G55) and built based on the template 3D structures using Prime (PRIME, version 2.2, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2010). The co-factor was included in this model and the DNA double helix was constructed from the structure of M.HhaI. The variable small loops and gaps were filled by knowledge-based, homology or ab initio approach of ORCHESTRAR, and then missing long loop was modeled using Loop Search module implemented in Sybyl 8.0. The loops showing the highest homology and the lowest root mean square deviations were selected. The side chains and hydrogen atoms were added and the stability of the homology model was validated by checking the geometry using PROCHECK. The homology model coordinates were then energy minimized with Macromodel (MACROMODEL, version 9.8, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2010) using MMFF94s force field in a water environment (until converging at a termination gradient of 0.05 kJ mol \u22121 -\u00c5) and the H-bonds were fixed using the SHAKE algorithm during molecular dynamics.",

            "text": "Flexible docking studies of NSC97317 with DNMT1 were performed with Glide XP following the protocol described in Methods. The efficacy of the docking protocol was recently demonstrated in a recent published docking and structure-based pharmacophore study of several known DNMT1 inhibitors [31] . Figure 3 shows three-and twodimensional (3D and 2D) representations of the optimized docked model of NSC97317 with DNMT1. Selected residues are shown. Of note, the deprotonated form of NSC97317 (expected in aqueous solution) is shown in the binding models. The best docking conformation of NSC97317 was generated by flexible docking. According to this binding model, NSC97317 makes hydrogen bond interactions with Ser1229 and Arg1397. The phosphate group of nucleoside analogues as well as the carboxylate anion of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid and RG108 also make hydrogen bonds with Ser1229 [31] . One of the salicylic acid moieties of NSC97317 forms a hydrogen bond network with key residues Glu1265, Arg1311, and Arg1461 (Fig. 3b) . It is worth pointing out that Glu1265 and Arg1311 seem to play a crucial role in catalytic mechanism (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, hydrogen bonds with Glu1265, Arg1311, and Arg1461 have also been predicted for other DNMT1 inhibitors and could be pharmacophoric. The second methylbenzoic acid moiety of NSC97317 makes hydrogen bonds with Gln1226, Lys1462, and 2\u2032-OH of the co-factor (Fig. 3b) . A similar hydrogen bond interaction with the co-factor has been reported for aurintricarboxylic acid, which is a very similar compound to NSC97317, with other methyltransferase. These hydrogen bond interactions are in agreement with the interactions found in the docking models of nucleoside analogues which are the most potent DNMT1 inhibitors. A comparison of the optimized binding mode of representation showing the hydrogen bonding network with the binding pocket. Deprotonated form of NSC97317 is shown in the 3D and 2D binding models NSC97317 with 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid revealed that both compounds adopt a different docking position in the binding pocket (vide infra). Of note, the docking score of NSC97317 with DNMT1 (-9.45 kcal mol \u22121 ) was better than the docking score of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid (-7.73 kcal mol \u22121 ) and similar with that of nucleoside analogues (data not shown). Figure 4 shows the comparison of the optimized binding mode of NSC97317 and 5,5\u2032-methylenedisalicylic acid with a recently developed pharmacophore hypothesis for known DNMT inhibitors [31] . The pharmacophore model includes five-point features with one negative charge (N), one hydrogen bond acceptor (A), one aromatic ring (R) and two hydrogen bond donors (D). Considering a distance matching tolerance of 2.0 \u00c5, a criteria commonly accepted in pharmacophore modeling [31, 35, 36] , only one carboxylic acid group of 5,5\u2032-methylenedisalicylic acid matches with the negative charged feature (Fig. 4b) . In contrast, the binding position of NSC97317 matches (considering a distance matching tolerance of 2.0 \u00c5) with the aromatic ring (R), hydrogen bond donor (D) (interaction with Glu1265) and hydrogen bond acceptor (A) (interaction with Arg1311 and Arg1461) of the pharmacophore hypothesis (Fig. 4a) . These results further supported the experimental observation that NSC97317 is a better DNMT1 inhibitor than 5,5\u2032-methylenedisalicylic acid.",

In addition, the calculated binding score for aurintricarboxylic acid (-8.77 kcal mol \u22121 ) is also better than the binding score for 5,5\u2032-methylenedisalicylic acid (\u22127.62 kcal mol \u22121 ). It remains to be determined the experimental enzymatic DNMT1 inhibition of aurintricarboxylic acid.",

            "text": "We report enzyme inhibition and molecular modeling studies of trimethylaurintricarboxylic acid (NSC97317) with the catalytic site of human DNMT1. NSC97317 is a low micromolar inhibitor of human DNMT1. Enzymatic and molecular modeling studies confirmed our hypothesis that this compound is a more potent inhibitor than 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid, a structurally related compound. Molecular docking studies with the catalytic domain of DNMT1 indicate that NSC97317 makes hydrogen bond interactions with amino acid residues involved in the mechanism of DNA methylation. The polyanionic structure of NSC97317 and the electropositive binding region of the catalytic site of DNMT1, due to several arginine residues, also seem to play a key role in the binding recognition. The key interactions of the analogue of aurintricarboxylic acid with the binding pocket of DNMT1 can be exploited in the structurebased discovery and optimization of DNMT1 inhibitors. NSC97317 is a promising research tool to study enzymatic inhibition of DNMT1 in the research of cancer and other diseases related to DNA methylation. Follow up studies include the evaluation of NSC97317 as a demethylating agent in cell based assays. Additional work planned is to determine the potential biochemical activity of NSC97317, aurintricarboxylic acid, and other analogues toward different isoforms of DNMT including DNMT3A and DNMT3B.",
