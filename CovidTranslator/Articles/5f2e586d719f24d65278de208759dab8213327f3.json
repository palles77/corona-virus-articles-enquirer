            "text": "ABSTRCT 29 Given the scale and rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 30 (SARS-CoV-2, known as 2019-nCov) infection , the ongoing global 31 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has become a huge public health issue. Rapid and precise 32 diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19, 33 providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse 34 transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with 35 nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully 36 established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment 37 (such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63\u00b0C) 38 for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame 39 1a/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified 40 and detected in a 'one-step' and 'single-tube' reaction, and the detection results were 41 easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 42 copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated 43 from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, 44 the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33) in the oropharynx swab 45 samples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96) when analyzed the clinical 46 samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from sample 47 collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h. In sum, the 48 RT-LAMP-NBS is a promising tool for diagnosing the current SARS-CoV-2 49 infection in first line field, public health and clinical laboratories, especially for 50 resource-challenged regions.",

Using the LAMP-based protocols, nucleic acid amplification is conducted under isothermal conditions (e.g., in a heating block) with high efficiency, specificity and speed, eliminating the use of precision thermal cycler for thermal change (9, 10). The LAMP technique is highly specific, because recognition of target sequence by six or eight independent regions is required (11). Thus far, LAMP combined with reverse transcription assay (RT-LAMP) had been developed for the detection of multiple respiratory RNA viruses (e.g., influenza viruses, middle east respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) (12).Regarding these traits of LAMP technique, development of a LAMP-based assay for diagnosis of COVID-19 can overcome the shortcomings posed by rRT-PCR methods, and facilitates rapid diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19.Up to now, two informal published LAMP assays have been developed for diagnosis of COVID-19, and preliminarily evaluated using clinical or stimulated respiratory samples(13, 14). Unfortunately, only a genetic sequence (Open reading frame 1a/b; F1ab) was amplified and detected in the two systems, an unreliable diagnosis result may be obtained when the two COVID-19 LAMP assays detected a sample with high homology sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., bat severe acute 102 respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus, GenBank KY417152.1). Traditional monitoring techniques (e.g., agarose gel electrophoresis, SYBR dyes and PH",
