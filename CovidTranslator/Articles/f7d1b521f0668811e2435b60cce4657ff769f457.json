She did not take any nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids during this period. Her chest x-ray results on May 13 remained normal. Other laboratory testing on May 13 showed resolution of lymphopenia, a lower serum CRP level (2.48 mg/dL), but an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (627 U/L; normal <460 U/L).",

However, borderline leukopenia (4.45 x 10 9 /L), borderline thrombocytopenia (167 x 10 9 /L), an elevated serum CK level (238 U/L), hyponatremia (128.2 mmol/L), and a progressively elevated serum LDH level (1,138 U/L) were noted. Because she had been afebrile for 5 days, she was discharged on May 17. After discharge, she continued to take ribavirin and be quarantined at home. Unfortunately, fever and rapidly progressive dyspnea developed on May 20. On the same day, chest x-ray showed diffusely increased infiltration over all lung zones. Hemogram showed leukocytosis (leukocyte count 14.03 x 10 9 /L). Serum CRP level was elevated to 12.7 mg/dL. Serum sodium level was 129.5 mmol/L. Serum AST level was 135 U/L, serum CK level was 71 U/L, and serum LDH level was 1,719 U/L. All blood cultures and sputum culture for bacteria yielded nothing.",

Under the assumption of probable SARS, she was given high-dose methylprednisolone (120 mg/day), and her clinical condition stabilized soon after. The results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV on a throat swab specimen performed on May 21 were positive. The results of immunofluorescent assays testing for immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG against SARS-CoV (performed in the research laboratory at National Taiwan University Hospital on May 21 and 27) were all positive (both IgM titers >1:10; both IgG titers >1:1,000). Sputum culture and Gram stain were both negative. Urine tests were also negative for pneumococcal and Legionella antigens. Other serologic tests, including those for chlamydiae, mycoplasmas, rickettsiae, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, RSV, and coxsackie virus were still negative. The ventilator was removed on June 9.",

            "text": "A previous report pointed out the great variety in the clinical course of SARS (4). We emphasize that even a patient with suspected SARS who became afebrile in the first week and remained so for 7 days without steroid or NSAID treatment still risks deterioration in the second week, as long as some laboratory values remain abnormal. Therefore, defervescence, even up to 7 days, may not be the single indicator for discharging SARS patients. Obtaining normal results for previously abnormal laboratory parameters, including hemogram, CRP, CK, AST, ALT, and LDH levels should be considered when deciding whether a patient can be safely discharged (5). From 1991 to 2000, babesiosis was diagnosed in 230 persons residing in New London County and adjacent Middlesex County, Connecticut (7). Fifty-three additional cases were reported in five other counties in Connecticut, but epidemiologic data did not indicate that these infections likely were acquired within Connecticut. We now note a new and distinct geographic focus by reporting the isolation of B. microti from rodents captured in the yards of two patients in whom babesiosis was diagnosed at Greenwich Hospital in 2002. These patients lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, which is located in Fairfield County in the extreme southwestern part of the state. Neither patient had traveled outside of the immediate area of Greenwich, Connecticut, before onset of illness. We also trapped rodents in the yards of two additional patients in whom babesiosis was diagnosed. These two patients had traveled to Rhode Island shortly before becoming ill. Patients became ill from June 23 to July 7, 2002, and none reported a tick bite.",

Establishing evidence of B. microti in rodents and documenting this protozoan parasite as the cause of human disease in Greenwich are important. Relatively high populations of the vector tick, Ixodes scapularis, are present in Greenwich and nearby towns. In 2002, the health departments of Greenwich, Stamford, New Canaan, and Darien submitted 1,671 I. scapularis ticks removed from persons to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station for identification and testing for Borrelia burgdorferi. Two hundred and thirty cases of Lyme disease were reported from these four towns in 2002 (Connecticut Department of Public Health, unpub. data). With such extensive human exposure to ticks and a relatively large number of Lyme disease cases in these four towns and elsewhere in Fairfield County, the number of cases of babesiosis is likely to increase appreciably in the future.",
