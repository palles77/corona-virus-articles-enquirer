            "text": "DNA vaccines delivered subcutaneously by gene-gun have generated strong protective and therapeutic immunity in rabbits. Recent studies have shown that peptides delivered by the mucosal routes also stimulate local and systemic immune responses. Since mucosal delivery is easier to administer and more cost-effective when compared to gene-gun delivery, we were interested to learn whether mucosally-delivered peptides would prime protective immunity comparable to that of genegun delivered DNA in rabbits. Our newly developed HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model was used to test the hypothesis. We chose an HLA-A2.1 restricted cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) E1 epitope (E1/303-311, MLQEKPFQL) for the peptide immunization studies because it provided complete protection when used as a DNA vaccine. Adjuvant has been widely used to boost immunity for vaccines. In this study, three adjuvants reported to be effective for rabbits (TT helper motif, PADRE and CpG2007) were tested with the peptide vaccine. Peptide alone or fused to TT helper or PADRE to create chimeric peptides was delivered by two mucosal routes (ocular and intranasal) together. Partial protection was found in HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits when peptide was delivered mucosally in the presence of adjuvant. When a subsequent booster of a half dose of the corresponding DNA vaccine was delivered, complete protections were achieved. We conclude that mucosal peptide immunization can be combined with a single DNA vaccination to provide strong protective immunity in rabbits.",

Using an HLA-A2.1 transgenic mouse model, investigators have identified numerous HLA-A2.1 restricted epitopes from different pathogens and proteins that have shown strong immunogenicity using this immunization strategy [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Some of these epitopes were later confirmed in their natural infection hosts and have become promising prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine candidates [9, 11, 12] . We and others have studied papillomavirus immunology in a rabbit model and successfully stimulated both strong protective and therapeutic immunity using DNA vaccination strategies [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . A heliumdriven gene gun delivery system has proven to be the most effective delivery vehicle for DNA vaccines when compared with intramuscular injection or biojector [18] . However, the cost associated with the gene gun system has limited its application in the clinic. We hypothesized that peptide immunization would work in our rabbit model with some modifications.",

We have demonstrated that a multivalent DNA vaccine containing five HLA-A2.1 restricted epitopes from cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) E1 was immunogenic and protective for these transgenic rabbits [19] . We further demonstrated that one of the epitopes (E1/303-311, MLQEKPFQL) provided complete protection when applied as a DNA vaccine [21] . In the study described here, we chose CRPVE1/303-311 for the peptide immunization test. Adjuvants have been used to augment the immune responses [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Several adjuvants have been found to be effective for rabbits. Among them,1) a TT helper motif (Tetanus Toxin 830-844, QYIKANSKFIGIT ELMLQEKPFQL); 2) a pan-HLA-DR-binding T-helper epitope [PADRE965.10, AK(X) VAAWTLKAAKMLQEKPFQL] and 3) CpG2007 ODNs (TCGTCGTTGTCGTTT TGTCGTT) have been tested in combination with DNA or peptide immunization and have shown promise in boosting immunity in rabbits [23] [24] [25] . In addition, peptide fused to adjuvant to form a chimeric peptide has been shown to be as effective as mixing peptide and adjuvant [24] [25] [26] . We therefore tested two chimeric CRPVE1/303-311 peptides by fusing them at the C-terminus of either TT helper motif or PADRE.",

Different delivery routes such as intradermal and mucosal (including intranasal and ocular) [27] [28] [29] [30] , and different adjuvants such as TT helper, PADRE and CpG2007 as well as combined immunization strategies such as peptide and DNA vaccine were investigated [27] . Our data suggested that both an appropriate adjuvant and a well-chosen delivery route were critical for effective peptide immunization. We found that peptide delivered by mucosal routes such as intranasal and ocular provided substantial protective immunity. TT helper appeared to be a stronger adjuvant than PADRE when immunizations were done with peptide; however, no significant difference was found between these two adjuvants when the peptide immunization was combined with DNA vaccination in rabbits. Peptide priming with single half dose DNA booster immunization achieved protection comparable to DNA vaccination alone.",

We had previously demonstrated that the TT helper motif was an effective adjuvant in our DNA vaccine. We wondered if this adjuvant, when used as a peptide in combination with mucosally delivered peptide might be effective in rabbits. CRPVE1/303-311 and another HLA-A2.1 restricted epitope CRPVE6/93-101, demonstrated to lack immunogenicity in HHD mice when delivered as a peptide (unpublished observation), were used for this experiment. 100\u00b5g peptide plus 100\u00b5g TT helper peptide were mixed in 1\u00d7PBS buffer. Four and five HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits were immunized with 50\u00b5l of these test or control peptide mixtures to mucosal sites (both nasal and ocular routes) for a total of three times with a two week interval respectively ( Table 2 ). In this experiment, besides wtCRPV, we also challenged rabbits with a CRPVE8ATGko mutant. The rationale for including the CRPVE8ATGko mutant papillomavirus DNA in this study was that this genome produces slow-growing, small papillomas. We hypothesized that the potentially weaker immunity generated by the peptide vaccine would be able to more effectively deal with these smaller tumors. Significantly smaller papillomas were found in CRPVE1/303-311 peptide immunized rabbits when compared to those found in CRPVE6/93-101 peptide group (Figure 1 , P<0.05, unpaired student t test) when papillomas were induced by wild type CRPV DNA. Significantly fewer papillomas induced by CRPVE8 ATGko mutant DNA were also found in CRPVE1/303-311 peptide immunized rabbits when compared with the control group ( ",

We have used genegun delivery to achieve strong and specific protective and therapeutic immunity in our rabbit papillomavirus model [10, 43] . Our recently established HLA-A2.1 transgenic model has allowed us to target a single epitope that promotes complete protective immunity in animals following DNA vaccination [20] . However, the gene-gun delivery system requires pure gold particles which are expensive. A low-cost vaccine delivery method is desired. Most vaccines are delivered by injection, which increases the risk of infection from HIV, hepatitis, and other serious diseases in areas where sterilization is problematic. Moreover, injecting vaccines can be a complex process, and used syringes and needles create a major waste disposal problem. Therefore, a noninvasive and effective vaccine delivery method is highly desirable for clinical use [44] . Peptide immunization in mice has shown promising results [24, 27, 45] . Mucosal delivery of peptide has been shown to be effective in the ocular HSV/rabbit model [28, 29] . To achieve an optimal result, we tested different adjuvants to augment the protection.

Many adjuvants help to trigger innate immunity or to direct Th-1 immunity in the host. While some of the adjuvants show universal effects in all species, others work in a more speciesrestricted manner [47] [48] [49] . In this study, adjuvant (HBV core) that worked well in HHD mice was found not to be effective in rabbits. On the other hand, TT helper and PADRE adjuvants worked much better in rabbits with TT helper showing more potent response in peptide immunization. Previous studies demonstrated that strong Th1 response was generated by mucosally delivery of HSV D-1 multi epitope peptides together with CpG2007 in an ocular HSV/ rabbit model [29] . In our study, we did not test CpG2007 with peptide alone. However, we found that stronger immunity was generated in rabbits when CpG2007 was used together with TT helper motif than with PADRE motif. Therefore, knowledge as to how to formulate more than two adjuvants for a vaccine could impact the outcome significantly. We have also shown that the delivery route used for peptide immunization is important for the outcome. The ocular HSV/rabbit model has demonstrated that mucosal delivery of lipopeptide without adjuvant stimulated strong immunity [28] indicating the mucosal routes are optimal delivery routes for this animal. Our study with the rabbit papillomavirus model further confirmed this observation. In this study, we combined intranasal and ocular routes together for delivery. It would be interesting to find if these two mucosal delivery routes are equivalent in stimulating immune responses for peptide immunization in our animals. We demonstrated that intradermal injection of peptide emulsion did not initiate an immune response in rabbits although it did in mice. However, when we delivered CRPVE1/303-311 peptide together with TT helper peptide mucosally, significant and specific protection was found. Therefore, both adjuvant and delivery route play important roles in the outcome of immune response in vivo.",

Other adjuvants such as CpG-ODN and Th-fusion have also been reported to enhance the immunotherapy effect [24, 52] . In this study, we fused our epitope with TT helper motif or PADRE and tested whether the chimeric products could provide improved immunity in animals. Although these chimeric peptides failed to stimulate a T cell response in HHD mice and rabbits after in vitro stimulation, they did prime strong protective immunity in A2 rabbits when combined with CpG2007. The difference on the immunogenicity of these chimeric peptides in HHD mice and HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits might result from the constitution of these two transgenic animals. HHD mice express a chimeric form of HLA-A2.1 with alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains derived from the human HLA-A2 and alpha 3 derived from mouse H-2Db and human beta-2 microglobulin covalently attached [6] . The transgenic rabbits, on the other hand, contain the whole human HLA-A2.1 heavy chain together with rabbit beta-2 microglobulin [19] . The compatibility of the peptide/MHCI complex from these two transgenic animals might influence outcome in terms of immunogenicity. In other words, the A2 rabbit has a better chance to recognize these epitopes when compared with A2 mice. We have demonstrated that some epitopes that are missed by A2 mice can be detected by A2 rabbits. This further confirms the advantage of this novel transgenic rabbit model. In addition, rabbits show higher genetic homology to humans and thus, results generated from this humanized rabbits could be more relevant to the human situation. In summary, chimeric peptide is an additional avenue for peptide based vaccine in rabbits.",

Our studies have demonstrated that gene gun-delivered DNA vaccination is effective in protecting rabbits from subsequent viral infection [13, 14, [53] [54] [55] . Three immunizations were usually administered to achieve the best protection in our previous studies [45] [46] [47] . In one of our most recent studies, we showed that a single DNA immunization failed to provide any protection [10] . In the study presented here, peptide priming followed by a single half-dose DNA booster immunization provided strong and specific protective immunity in rabbits. This suggests that the peptide immunization primed a strong immunity for DNA vaccination because no such strong protection was seen with peptide immunization alone. Because DNA vaccination by gene-gun is more expensive and time consuming than peptide immunization, the combination of peptide priming and low dose gene gun boosting could provide a satisfactory strategy. By combining both delivery methods, we achieved strong protective immunity comparable to that of DNA vaccination alone. Different laboratories have tested numerous prime/boost strategies in attempts to find the best combinations. DNA prime-protein booster has been shown to induce high titers of neutralizing antibody [56] ; A DNA priming/ vaccinia booster regime stimulated strong T cell response in vivo [57] . In our study, we found priming with peptide and boosting with DNA could stimulate strong protective immunity in animals. Because both peptide and DNA delivery methods are noninvasive, this combined immunization strategy can be potentially adapted for future clinical trials.",

Comparable growth was found in both immunization groups before week 6. Papillomas on rabbits immunized with TT helper fused CRPVE1/303-311 peptide then began to grow more slowly and the mean papilloma size was significantly smaller when compared with that on PADRE fused CRPVE1/303-311 peptide immunized rabbits (P<0.05, unpaired student t test). Papilloma outgrowth after peptide priming/ booster immunization in HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits. Nineteen HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits were divided into four groups (N=5/per group except four animals for chimeric PADRE -HPVE7/82-90). 100\u00b5l of TT helper or PADRE fused peptides together with 25\u00b5g of CpG2007 were delivered to HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits by intranasal and ocular routes for three times with a two-week interval between immunizations. One week after the final booster immunization, the rabbits were challenged with wild type CRPV and a hybrid CRPV containing HPV16E7/82-90 DNA at left and right back sites. Three days after DNA challenge, the rabbits were given 6 shots of DNA vaccine (half of the normal dose of DNA). The rabbits were monitored for papilloma outgrowth at week 2 after the infection. Significantly smaller papillomas were found in CRPVE1/303-311 peptide immunized rabbits with both adjuvants when compared with corresponding control peptide HPV16E7/82-90(P<0.05, unpaired student t test). No significant difference was found between TT helper vs. PADRE fused CRPVE1/303-311 as found previously noted (P>0.05, unpaired student t test). ",
