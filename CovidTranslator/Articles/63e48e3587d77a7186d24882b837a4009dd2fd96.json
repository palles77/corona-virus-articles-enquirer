Virus was purified by ultracentrifugation on 30% glycerol cushion followed by differential centrifugation on 10-60% sucrose gradient and inactivated with \u2424-propio lactone at a concentration of 1:3500. The inactivated product was blended with aluminium phosphate (3%) and immunized 4-week-old Swiss albino mice. Neutralizing antibodies in the range of 1:10 to 160 and 1:80 to 1:320 was detected with 85% and 100% sero-conversion after 2nd and 3rd dose, respectively. All the immunized mice with antibody titer above 1:20 survived live virus challenge. The vaccine candidate has potential to be an efficient vaccine against CHP virus.",

CHPV, a novel virus causing febrile illness in man was discovered accidentally during an outbreak investigation of dengue/chikungunya-like illness in Nagpur district, Maharashtra, India. The virus was isolated on a few subsequent occasions from Phlebotomus sand flies and humans; however, due to low or no pathogenicity to humans, not much attention was given to the virus until its resurgence in a virulent form in 2003, killing 183 children in AP [1] . The case fatality rate (CFR) was >56% and most deaths occurred within 48 h of onset of symptoms. The outbreak was comparatively severe in Gujarat as 18 children died out of 23 admitted and the CFR was 78.3% [2] . Most of the deaths occurred within 24 h. Sporadic cases are reported every year from the endemic areas of AP and Maharashtra [3, 4] . Patients are treated symptomatically as no effective vaccines or therapeutics is available. Development and evaluation of a subunit vaccine was reported recently which produced good immunogenicity in laboratory animals. An attempt was therefore made to develop a tissue culture based inactivated vaccine candidate against the virus. * Corresponding author. Tel.: +91 20 26006290; fax: +91 20 25871895.",

The cells were grown in 150 cm 2 tissue culture flasks (Nunc, Denmark) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, USA). Virus infection, harvest, virus quantitation and storage were carried out as described earlier [5] . In brief, the cells when formed a confluent monolayer, were infected with 1 MOI of virus and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C with intermittent rocking at every 15 min. After incubation, the inoculum was discarded; cells were washed twice with PBS and fed with maintenance medium (DMEM containing 2% FBS). Cells were incubated at 37 \u2022 C, observed under an inverted microscope for the appearance of cytopathic effects (CPE) and harvested when more than 75% cells exhibited CPE. The cultures were freeze-thawed thrice, centrifuged the cell lysate at 5,000 rpm in a refrigerated centrifuge for 30 min, and collected the supernatant.

The disease is predominantly rural and majority of the patients belong to the low socio-economic class of the society. The virus is transmitted through sand flies, which breed in cracks and crevices around human habitats. The high case fatality rate and rapid progression of the disease warranted the need for an effective vaccine for immunization of children in the endemic areas. A recombinant candidate vaccine using CHPV G-protein was reported to have developed recently with 90% protection in mice [7, 8] . The gene (G-gene) was expressed in baculovirus expression system, HPLC purified and used for mice immunization. Three doses were given at an interval of 4 weeks at a concentration of one microgram. Anti-CHPV IgG antibodies were observed as early as 2nd week of immunization. Live virus challenge through IC route demonstrated 90% protection. They also observed neutralization of homologous and heterologous viruses with the antisera. The investigators also demonstrated the induction of both arms of immune response. The vaccine was evaluated in combination with commercially available DPT vaccine to determine the efficacy of the combination in a view to cover the local endemic population. The combination yielded identical results as observed for CHPV vaccine [9] .",

Gel filtration Chromatography using Sephacryl S-200 (Sigma Chemical Co., USA) was also used as per the manufacturer's instructions to purify the virus. However, the yield of purified CHPV with biological activity was very low. CHPV purification using column chromatography was also not successful due to the low yield of virus with biological activity. The use of ultracentrifugation on 30% glycerol cushion followed by centrifugation of discontinuous sucrose gradient (10-60%) was found effective to achieve the highest amount of purified virus as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig. 1) .",
