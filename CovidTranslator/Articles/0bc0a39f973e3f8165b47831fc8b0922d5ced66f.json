In vivo study indicated that the mixture of E5 and E7 immunodominant peptides from four types of high-risk HPV could induce Th1 immune response, and protect completely mice against TC-1 tumor cells.

            "text": "With more than 200 genotypes, human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main reason for cervical cancer, and most common sexually transmitted viruses in the world (Bruggmann et al. 2018) . Based on the annual report of the International Agency for Research on Cancer evaluation (IARC), twelve types of HPVs (i.e., 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59) were classified as high-risk types. Among high-risk HPV types, HPV 16, 18, 31 and 45 had the highest prevalence among women with cervical cancer in the world (Bruggmann et al. 2018) . HPV genome has an 8 kb circular double strand DNA that encodes eight open reading frames (ORFs) consisting of the early and late genes. Early proteins (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6 and E7) play the vital role in cell cycle, signaling pathway, genome replication and transcription. In contrast, late proteins (L1 and L2) are involved in capsid formation (Liu et al. 2017; Graham 2010) . Nowadays, three commercially HPV prophylactic vaccines are available, but none of them show a therapeutic effect on existing HPV infection and related cancers (Bharadwaj et al. 2009; Joura et al. 2015) . Thus, due to high prevalence of HPV infections, development of an effective therapeutic vaccine is indispensable. Moreover, HPV E5, E6 and E7 proteins are ideal targets for generating a therapeutic vaccine due to their important roles in tumor pathogenesis, cellular transformation (degradation of p53 and pRB) and virus replication (Hoppe-Seyler et al. 2018; Ganguly 2012) . Up to now, several therapeutic vaccines have been developed based on viral oncoproteins as ideal targets including live vector-based vaccines, bacterial or viral vectorsbased vaccines, DNA and RNA vectors-based vaccines, peptide and protein-based vaccines, and whole cell-based vaccines. However, each strategy showed some advantages and disadvantages (Yang et al. 2016) [8] . Thus, it is important to find effective and safe methods in therapeutic vaccine design (e.g., increasing their immunogenicity) (Gomez-Gutierrez et al. 2007; Cassetti et al. 2004; Reinis et al. 2010 ). Among different approaches, peptide vaccines were known as a key strategy because of various advantages such as high selectivity and sensitivity, easy production and cost-effective. A valuable peptide vaccine should be composed of immunodominant T-and B-cell epitopes that reduce immune responses against self-antigens (i.e., autoimmunity). Therefore, a main step is the interaction between epitopes with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Li et al. 2014 ). Bioinformatics tools have been developed for different aspects of immunological features such as epitope prediction and mapping, molecular modeling and structural vaccinology (Sirskyj et al. 2011) . These tools can predict the highly immunogenic epitopes in a short time with high specificity, and can be used for development of an effective vaccine (Jurtz et al. 2017) . In this study, to design a novel therapeutic vaccine against major high risk HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 45, we used both sequence-based and structural vaccinology immunoinformatics tools. The E7 and E5 proteins of each HPV were considered to design peptide constructs. After preparation of constructs using bioinformatics analysis, their potency was assessed by in vivo studies (i.e., induction of immune responses and tumor eradication in mice).",

Prediction of linear and discontinuous antibody epitopes Linear antibody epitopes (or B cell epitopes) can be predicted using sequence-based algorithms and mainly based on amino acid properties such as charge and hydrophobicity.

In E5 peptide construct, one linear epitope (VFIYIPLFVIHTHASF) and four discontinuous epitopes were identified. In E7 peptide construct, four linear epitopes (FAAYSSAD, GQAEPDRAHY, EPDTSNYNIVT and LHLEPQNELDP), and five discontinuous epitopes had the highest epitope prediction scores (Table 4 ). Figure 4 indicated an example of the 3D structure of putative B cell epitopes in the E5 and E7 peptide constructs.",

            "text": "Therapeutic vaccine is an attractive strategy to stimulate the immune system against cancer-associated HPV high-risk types. A therapeutic vaccine should target HPV antigens that can be constitutively expressed in HPV-associated malignancies (Schiller et al. 2008) . Because of HPV E5, E6 and E7 roles in tumor pathogenesis, cellular transformation and virus replication, they are ideal targets for generating a therapeutic vaccine (Kumar et al. 2015; Chabeda et al. 2018) . Peptide vaccines are safe, stable and easy to produce but they are restricted to a specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Another issue is the low immunogenicity of peptide-based vaccines. Therefore, bioinformatics tools were used to solve these problems and design a multi-epitope vaccine. Due to the advantageous use of bioinformatics tools, many studies used these tools to design a peptidebased vaccine against a hypervariable virus such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Li et al. 2013 ; Numeral previous studies applied bioinformatics tools for epitope prediction and therapeutic vaccine design based on HPV E5 and E7 proteins. In 2015, Kumar et al. found 11 potent epitopes in HPV16-E5 protein for MHC-I based on immunogenicity scores (Kumar et al. 2015) . In 2016, Singh et al. studied E1, E2, E6 and E7 protein sequences collected from all high-risk HPV types to identify cross-clade immunodominant regions. They introduced 14 peptides (9 to 43 amino acids) which can be used as potent regions in therapeutic vaccines (Singh et al. 2016 ). Tsang et al. analyzed HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins and found six immunogenic epitopes, as well (Tsang et al. 2017) . While the oncogenic activities of E6 and E7 were well known, the role of E5 is still rather unclear. The recent studies have indicated the important role of E5 oncoprotein in cell transformation, tumourigenesis, and immune modulation (Venuti et al. 2011) . The researchers showed that HPV16 E5 oncoprotein was expressed in early stage of carcinogenesis and could be a target of immunotherapy (Paolini et al. 2017 ). On the other hand, the presence of E5 viral transcripts could be a major marker of active viral infection, and subsequently a target of immunotherapy. HPV16 E5 was highly expressed in HPV16-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) patients (Taberna et al. 2018) . Generally, most studies have focused on E7 oncoprotein, because it is more abundantly expressed and better characterized immunologically. Furthermore, its sequence is more conserved than that of the E6 gene (Mahdavi and Monk 2005) . In this study, we considered E5 protein as a novel target and E7 protein as a major target in vaccine design. Based on our previous study (Panahi et al. 2018) and to overcome the MHC limitation, the long overlapping peptide constructs containing HPV 16,18,31,45 E5 and E7 epitopes were designed. These epitopes had the highest scores in important parameters such as binding affinity between peptide and MHC, MHC-I processing, peptide-MHC docking and population coverage. In addition to previous analyses, we used structural bioinformatics tools to determine (1) physicochemical properties of the designed constructs, (2) potential IFN-c-inducing epitopes, (4) allergenicity, and (5) linear and discontinuous B cell epitopes by modeling and validation of 3D structure of the designed constructs. Subsequently, for in vivo analysis, the candidate E5 and E7 peptide constructs were synthesized, and their immunological responses and anti-tumor effects were evaluated in mice. The physicochemical properties of the E5 and E7 peptide constructs showed that they are stable, soluble and non-allergen. In addition, the E5 peptide construct had 2 positive charge residues and the E7 peptide construct consisted of 2 positive and 11 negative charge residues. On the other hand, IFN-c has a key role in intracellular immunity against HPV infection (Day et al. 2017) . Our data showed that SPATAFTVYVFCFLLA (E5-type 18) and TLQEIVLHLEPQNELDPVDLL (E7-type 45) had the highest scores for stimulation of IFN-gamma against HPVs. In the case of 3D modeling of the E5 and E7 peptide constructs, I-TASSER server was selected to predict the protein 3D structure. The accuracy of the selected models was evaluated by C-score (significance of threading template alignments and the convergence parameters of the structure assembly simulations). C-scores of the best models for E5 and E7 peptides were -3.47 and -2.97, respectively. These data showed that the accuracy of E7 is greater than E5. Based on the Ramachandran plots and ERRAT scores of the refined models, the quality of the predicted 3D constructs was improved after refinement (Fig. 3) leading to a higher quality of final models. Final E5 and E7 3D models were selected as input for B-cell linear and discontinuous epitope predictions. In the current study, Ellipro server analyzed 3D models and found one linear epitope (VFIYIPLFVIHTHASF) and four discontinuous Prophylactic studies against TC-1 tumor cells: Five groups of C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with different regimens three times with a 2-week interval and then challenged with 1 9 10 5 TC-1 in the right flank 2 weeks after second booster. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week (a). The percentage of tumor-free mice was determined over time in various groups (b) epitopes in the E5 peptide construct, and four linear epitopes (FAAYSSAD, GQAEPDRAHY, EPDTS-NYNIVT and LHLEPQNELDP) and five discontinuous epitopes in the E7 peptide construct. These data indicated the ability of the designed constructs for induction of B-cell responses. In addition, our previous bioinformatics analysis (containing molecular docking and sequence-based approaches) showed that these epitopes had high potency for inducing CTL and T helper cell responses. These epitopes represented high population coverage (* 99%) among different area of the world. After bioinformatics analysis, immunological assays of the designed constructs were studied in mice. Indeed, we compared the potency of each peptide as individual (HPV 16, 18, 31, 45 E5 polytope peptide or HPV 16, 18, 31, 45 E7 polytope peptide) with the combined regimen (HPV 16, 18, 31, 45 E5 polytope peptide plus HPV 16,18,31,45 E7 polytope peptide) as a candidate antigen designed by bioinformatics analyses. For enhancement of peptide immunity, Montanide ISA720 was used as a commercial adjuvant. Our results showed that the E5/E7 peptide-specific immunity in mice who received the E5 ? E7 peptides (G3) resulted in the highest levels of IFN-c and IgG2b secretion among all groups. A study indicated that the recombinant lipidated HPVE7 induced a high level of IgG2b/IgG1, a Th1-biased immune response, and protective immunity in mice (Huang et al. 2012 ). Regarding to our observations in protective and therapeutic studies, this regimen (the E5 ? E7 peptides) could completely confer protection against TC-1 tumor cell-challenged mice depending on stimulation of CD4 ? T cell-dominated Th1 responses as well as Granzyme B secretion. Some experimental studies demonstrated the immunogenicity of different identified antigenic peptides of HPV16/18 E6 and E7 proteins. For instance, a study showed that the intranasal administration of the combined HPV16 peptide vaccine [E7 44-62 peptide (QAEPDRAHY-NIVTFCCKCD); E7 49-57 peptide (RAHVYNIVTIF); E6 43-57 peptide (QLLRREVYDFAFRDL); and E6 49-58 peptide (VYDFAFRDLC)) with a4-1BB and aCTLA-4 antibodies produced efficient therapeutic effects and high safety against orally implanted mEER tumors (Dorta-Estremera et al. 2018 ). Moreover, the use of CpG motif (ODN1826: 5 0 -TCCAT-GACGTTCCTGACGTT-3 0 ) as an adjuvant with E7 peptide-based immunotherapy (The H-2b-restricted E7 CTL epitope: RAHYNIVTF) led to reduce the tumor growth (Gendron et al. 2006) . Other study showed that the conjugation of HPV16 E7 long peptide (E7 43-77 : GQAEPDRAHY-NIVTFCCKCDSTLRLCVQSTHVDIR) to ultrasmall polymeric nanoparticles could enhance the antitumor effects in different mouse models of HPV ? cancers (Galliverti et al. 2018) . Van der Burg et al. reported the immunogenic epitopes of HPV16 E7 41-62 including a CTL epitope (QAEPDRAHY) (van der Burg et al. 2001; Jabbar et al. 2018 ). Our predicted HPV16 E7 epitope involved this reported epitope (GQAEPDRAHYNIVTF), as well. Currently, many reports indicated that long epitopes (containing 15-mers or longer) could induce an effective immune response as compared to short epitopes (Jabbar et al. 2018 ). According to these experimental reports, we designed two vaccine constructs with longer peptide epitopes (from 14 to 26 amino acid length). Up to now, most of the HPV therapeutic vaccines have been focused on HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes. However, these vaccines could not completely eradicate the lesions. Recently, HPV E5 oncogene attracted a special attention. Liao et al. showed that the injection of an E5 peptide along with CpG motif induced effective cellular immune responses and prolonged the survival time after tumor cell inoculation. This study demonstrated the importance of HPV16 E5 as a possible target for development of the therapeutic strategies against cervical cancer (Liao et al. 2013) . Our study showed that the mixture of E5 and E7 immunodominant epitopes from four types of high risk HPV could generate high levels of IFN-c, IgG2b and IgG2a against IL-5, IL-10 and IgG1 indicating the induction of Th1 immune responses as well as high Granzyme B secretion indicating CTL activity as compared to groups receiving E7 or E5 peptides, individually. Indeed, the mixture of E7 and E5 peptides could elicit higher immune responses and stronger anti-tumor effects (100% for the E7 ? E5 peptides against 66.67% for the E7 peptide and 33.33% for the E5 peptide).",

In this line, the in vivo experiment confirmed bioinformatics data by showing a higher level of IFN-c secretion and total IgG for E7 peptide (Fig. 6 ). In addition, bioinformatics tools predict high solubility and molecular weight of peptides that was confirmed in in vitro analysis (Supplementary 2 and 3) . However, it should be noted that in vivo experimental data indicated higher capacity of peptides for trigger immune system in the combined form (i.e., E5 ? E7). Indeed, the bioinformatics prediction is a pointer of potential immunogenicity of peptide but it is not a criterion for function assignment. Therefore, bioinformatics analysis should be confirmed with experimental approaches.",

The in vivo results supported the immunogenic potential of these predicted peptides especially in the combined form (i.e., the mixture of E5 and E7 peptides). Herein, E5 peptide could increase immune responses that nonspecifically enhanced the E7 potency against tumor growth. However, there are limitations in the recent study such as the lack of tumor cell line expressing E5 oncoprotein. Development of a tumor cell line expressing E7 and E5 can be considered as an important approach in the next studies. Moreover, it is suitable for using the designed peptides in different modalities such as heterologous prime/boost strategy as well as the use of delivery systems for improvement of therapeutic vaccine in near future.",
