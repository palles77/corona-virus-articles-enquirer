NEUROBIOL AGING 5(2) [93][94][95][96][97][98][99] 1984.--Aging-related changes in several structural characteristics of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) were evaluated using Fischer 344 rats 3, 18, 30 or 36 months of age. Histological examination of the nasal mucosa revealed no evidence of concurrent rhinitis in any of the animals studied. The internal granular layer of the MOB exhibited continual growth, increasing in volume by a factor of 63% over the range of ages studied. The sizes of MOB mitral cell perikarya and nuclei, expressed either as observed cross-sectional areas or as estimated mean volumes, did not change significantly as a function of age. The numbers of mitral cells exhibiting 2 nucleoli in the plane of section decreased from about 22% in the youngest animals to about 4% in the 18-and 30-month old animals and to nil in the oldest animals. These results are discussed in relation to findings of other investigators using Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats. It is concluded that major structural age changes in the rat MOB are strain dependent.",

            "text": "In a remarkably thorough series of reports, Hinds and McNelly described aging-related changes in the structural and untrastructural characteristics of the olfactory epithelium and MOB of two substrains of Sprague-Dawley rats 3-36 months of age [6, 7, 8, 9] . They reported that the volume of the internal granular layer of the MOB increased dramatically between 3 and 18-24 months of age and steadily declined thereafter [6] . This general pattern of growth and atrophy was mirrored in many of the parameters they quantified at both the light-and electron microscopic levels, including the volumes of the other layers of the MOB, the volumes of mitral cell perikarya and nuclei, the volume and length of large dendrites in the external plexiform layer, the number and density of perikaryal mitral-to-granule cell synapses, and the number of glomerular axodendritic synapses [6, 7] . Moreover, their findings suggested that both growth and atrophy of the MOB and its constituent neural elements were reactive responses to aging-related changes in the number of olfactory receptor neurons [8] . The observa-tions that both the peripheral and central components of this system undergo substantial growth in the first two years of life are consistent with reports of neurogenesis of olfactory receptor neurons (e.g., [5, 15] ) and of MOB granule cells (e.g., [1, 12] ) in adult rodents.",

In an early study using Wistar rats, Smith [23] found a 17% increase in the volume of the whole MOB between 3 and 12 months of age, followed by sharply decreased MOB volume at 24 and 36 months of age. However, his finding that the olfactory nerve layer was completely absent either unilaterally or bilaterally in rats of various ages suggests that many of the animals used in that study were subject to some degree of atrophic rhinitis. More recently, Roselli-Austin and Altman [19] found that neither the volume of the internal granular layer nor the average area of mitral cell profiles changed significantly between 3 and 12 months of age in the Wistar rat. Together, these reports raise some doubt as to the generality of Hinds and McNelly's findings to other rat strains.",

The average cell volume, including the nucleus, for each animal was estimated as the volume of a sphere having a radius equal to the arithmetic mean of the individual cell radii. To estimate the average nuclear volume, the mean observed nuclear radius was computed for each animal, corrected for Holmes' effect and \"lost cap\" according to the method of Freedman [4] , and this corrected mean radius used to compute the volume of an equivalent sphere. Average perikaryal volume, exclusive of the nucleus, was computed by subtraction. It should be noted that the validity of the estimates of cellular and perikaryal size relies, in part, on the assumption that any section through the nucleus passes through the center of the cell (cf., [6] ). Although failure of this assumption would result in an underestimation of average cellular or perikaryal size, there is no reason to suspect that such an effect would be age-dependent. Freedman's correction procedure for the \"lost cap\" relies on an estimate of the proportion, k/r, of the actual radius for which the profile is not discriminable due to contrast deficiency. In the present study, the value of k/r was estimated according to the formula:",

This observation is contrary to that of Hinds and McNelly, who noted slightly smaller profiles in the dorsal quadrant and slightly larger profiles in the ventral quadrant [6] . In view of the fact that their sections were cut in a plane \"coronal to the long axis of the olfactory bulb\" ( [6] , pp. 346-347), while in the present study, the plane of section was more nearly vertical, corresponding roughly to the coronal plane of Krnig and Klippel [13] , both observations likely reflect the influence of cutting angle relative to the long axis of the cells rather than true regional differences in mitral cell size. Figure 7 shows the mean numbers of mitral cells exhibiting two nucleoli in the plane of section for the four age groups. This pattern is similar to that observed by Hinds and McNelly [6] in Sprague-Dawley rats (Wisconsin strain), though they reported that the value of this parameter declined to zero by 30 months of age.",

Like Sprague-Dawley rats, F344 rats exhibit dramatic growth of the IGL in the first two years of life, but in the F344 rats this growth continues unabated through the third year as well. Thus, declining IGL volume is not obligatory, even in very old animals. In contrast to the observed age changes in both these strains, Roselli-Austin and Altman [19] found that neither the volume of the whole MOB nor of the IGL changes significantly between 3 and 12 months of age in Wistar rats. It should be noted, however, that a 15-20% change in volume, as seen in F344 and Sprague-Dawley strains over that age range, would be well within the limits of variability they reported. An even stronger strain effect is evident with regard to age changes in the volume of MOB mitral cells. Hinds and McNelly found that, between 3 and 27 months of age, mitral cell volume doubles or triples in Sprague-Dawley strains. Between 3 and 12 months of age, the volume increase is on the order of 30--40% in those strains ( [6] , Fig. 8 ; [8] , Fig. 9 ). In contrast, F344 rats exhibit no significant changes in mitral cell volume between 3 and 36 months of age. Likewise, Roselli-Austin and Altman found no significant change in mitral cell size in Wistar rats between 3 and 12 months of age.",

Hinds and McNelly found that these two parameters, and most of the other light-and electron microscopic features which they quantified, exhibit a rough parallelism both in growth and subsequent atrophy in Sprague-Dawley rats [6, 7, 8] . The present findings indicate that the age changes they observed in IGL volume and in mitral cells, at least during the growth phase, might have resulted from independent age-related processes, since these two age effects are dissociated in F344 rats. Hinds and McNelly have argued that age-related hypertrophy of mitral cells in Sprague-Dawley rats is in reaction to primary age changes in the numbers of olfactory receptor neurons [8] , a suggestion which is in keeping with the known proliferative capactiy of olfactory receptor neurons in adult mammals [5, 15] . If that were the case, the present findings might imply that neurogenesis among olfactory receptor neurons did not yield an overall increase in the numbers of receptor cells in F344 rats. It may be that increases in IGL volume seen in both strains are in response to turnover or proliferation of MOB granule cells during adulthood (cf., [1, 12] ) rather than to changes in the numbers of peripheral receptor neurons. There is presently no basis for presuming that these two proliferative processes are coupled to one another in any way. Thus, they might exert parallel influences on mitral cell hypertrophy and IGL growth in Sprague-Dawley strains, but not in the F344 strain.",

For example, Hsu and Peng [10] reported volume changes ranging from -2% to +75% in hypothalamic nuclei of Sprague-Dawley rats over 24 months of age in comparison with rats 3.5-5 months old. Even those regions which these investigators found to grow most dramatically, the supreoptic nucleus and medial preoptic area, were found by Lamperti and Blaha [14] to show no age-related size changes in adult golden hamster. Similarly, Brizzee and co-workers [2] reported a 12% increase in whole brain weight between 3.5 and 26-32 months of age in Long-Evans rats, while Roberts and Goldberg [18] reported no significant change in whole brain weight of F344 rats between 2 and 28 months of age.",

Considering that the nucleolus is the site of ribosomal RNA synthesis, age changes in numbers of mitral cell nucleoli might reflect changes in ribosomal gene copy number in these cells. Though there are clearly more direct and, therefore, more valid measures of age changes in the rate of RNA synthesis, the observed age effect on nucleolar numbers has important implications for quantitative analyses of neuron numbers based on nucleolus counts.",

For the past several years, rats and mice maintained in the NIA contract colony have exhibited serological titers to sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV; personal communication from Charles River veterinary staff). SDAV is a murine corona virus which is capable of causing moderate to severe rhinitis [11] . In any colony in which SDAV infection is endemic, it is likely that animals become infected shortly after weaning and suffer a brief period of rhinitis followed by reconstitution of the olfactory mucosa. Once infected, animals exhibit serological titers to SDAV throughout the remainder of their lives and are refractory to further infection (cf., [11] ). In view of the histological evidence that all of the animals studied were free of concurrent disease, it may be concluded that chronic or recurrent rhinitis was not a factor in the present results.",

Intraspecific strain effects such as this can be of great value in experimental aging research (cf., [24] ). Aging is a multidimensional process which can be manifested in a variety of ways in different species and individuals. One problem facing experimental gerontologists is that of identifying particular age effects which can be experimentally controlled independently of the myriad of other aging-related changes which are manifested concurrently. In this regard, there is a potentially great advantage in comparing closely related strains of animals which show reliable differences in a limited subset of age effects, as appears to be the case in the rat olfactory system.",

The mean estimated value of k/r for the 4 age groups, 0.12, was used in all computations of actual nuclear volume. Applying these procedures to Hinds and McNelly's data ([6];Fig. 6), estimates of k/r in the range 0.026--0.050 were obtained. These values compare favorably with their own estimate of 0.04, based on a serial reconstruction procedure. The somewhat higher value of k/r for the material used in the present study is in keeping with the greater thickness and lower contrast of the sections in comparison with those used by Hinds and McNelly.",
