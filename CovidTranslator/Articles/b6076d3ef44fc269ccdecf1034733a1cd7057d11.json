Although significant differences in number and arrangement of envelope constituents occur, there are several features of membrane structure shared by all of these viruses.

The glycoproteins are usually present in the form of spikes about 7-10 nm in length. The glycoproteins are amphipathic molecules. They consist of an external hydrophilic part and of a hydrophobic segment by which the spikes are strongly associated with the lipid bflayer (for review see Compans and Klenk [7] ).",

At the cotranslational level, proteolytic cleavage in many instances removes the signal sequences required for insertion of the nascent polypeptides into the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Posttranslational cleavage is involved in the processing of a series of these glycoproteins, such as the influenza hemagglutinin and the glycoproteins of paramyxoviruses, alphaviruses, and oncoviruses. In the case of the myxovirus glycoproteins, posttranslational proteolytic cleavage was found to be a precondition for biological activity (for review, see Klenk and Rott [35] ).",

The carbohydrate chains are assembled on the phosphate ester of the isoprenoid alcohol dolichol with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, GDP-mannose, mannosylphosphoryldolichol, and glucosylphosphoryldolichol as sugar donors. After the en bloc transfer of the oligosaccharide to the polypeptide and cleavage of the pyrophosphate linkage doliehol phosphate is available for a new assembly cycle. The oligosaccharide synthesized in this way is usually a tetra-decasaccharide of the structure (glucosyl)3-(mannosyl)9-(N-acetylglucosamine)2. Under certain conditions to be described below a decasaccharide of the structure (glucosyl)a-(mannosyl)s-(Nacetylglucosamine)2 can be transferred. Glycosylatinn via the decasaccharide lipid is called the alternate pathway. The enzymes involved in the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharides are membrane-bound and appear to occur mainly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (for a discussion, see Schwarz and Datema [61] .",

First, the three glucose residues are removed by specific glucosidases to yield a mannose-rich carbohydrate side chain [23, 24] . At this stage, processing of the oligosaccharide may cease. In most instances, however, it continues by a trimming process resulting in the release of all the mannoses but three. By the subsequent addition of Nacetylglucosamine, galactose, fucose, and neuraminic acid the complex oligosaccharides are formed [41] . The available evidence indicates that the enzymes involved in this last step in the glycosylation sequence are located in the Golgi apparatus (for review, see Klenk and Rott [35] . teins and that both types are derived from a common precursor. It is also evident from what has been said above that the number and the position of the oligosaccharides on the polypeptide is determined by the presence of appropriate amino acid sequences that can act as attachment sites. The number of side chains attached to different glycoproteins varies therefore over a wide range; e.g. the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus has only two oligosaccharides [17, 53] , whereas as many as seven side chains can be observed on the influenza hemaggiutinin. The studies on the influenza hemagglutinin revealed also that the many variants of this glycoprotein vary widely in the distribution of the glycosylation sites and the oligosaceharide types attached to them [38, 48, 59, 70] .",

It is interesting to note that according to the three-dimensional model of the hemagglutinin [71] all conserved side chains are located in close vicinity to each other at the base of the spike.

These include, among others, D-glucosamine and 2-deoxy-D-glucose [19, 30, 34] , 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose [55] , and tunicamycin [66] . The first virus to demonstrate that these substances specifically interfere with glycosylation was influenza virus, where in the presence of inhibitors the unglycosylated form of the viral hemagglutinin could be identified [36, 58] . Inhibitors of glycosylation became therefore valuable tools in studying the role of the carbohydrate moiety in the biosynthesis and function of viral glycoproteins. Most of these substances interfere with the assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. Little is known on inhibitors interfering with the transfer to the polypeptide or with the processing of the protein-bound 01igosaccharide. Because the different steps in glyco~lation occur in different cell compartments, inhibitors of intracellular transport (for review, see Tartakoff [68] will indirectly interfere with processing. In the following the mode of action of the glycosylation inhibit0rs interfering with virus multiplication will be briefly discussed. For further information the reader is referred to more comprehensive reviews [57, [60] [61] [62] . The latter two deal also with other glycosylation inhibitors, such as bacitracin, amphomycin, showdomycin, and diumycin which so far have not been found to be active in intact animal cells.",

The reaction of the dolichol cycle inhibited by UDP-deoxyglucose is the formation of glucosylphosphoryldolichol (Fig. 1) . GDPdeoxyglucose, which appears to be the most important inhibitory metabolite, interferes I) with the formation of dolichol.linked monosaccharides by trapping phosphoryldolichol as deoxyglucosylphosphoryldolichol, and 2) with the assembly of the lipid.linked oligosaccharide by incorporation of deoxyglucose instead of mannose. Deoxyglucosylphosphoryldolichol interferes also with the formation of the lipid-bound oligosaccharide by replacing glucose with deoxyglucose. Studies in cell-free systems have shown that lipidlinked oligosaccharides containing deoxyglucose are not transferred to the polypeptide [i 1]. On the other hand, it has also been shown that under non-inhibitory conditions deoxyglucose can be incorporated into glycoproteins [31] . This apparent discrepancy is not understood. It is obvious from these fmdings that deoxyglucose acts primarily as an analogue to mannose. It is therefore not surprising that its inhibitory action can be reversed by mannose [31] .",

It was not expected, however, that in chick embryo cells that had been infected with the same virus and treated with tunicamycin neither HAo nor its cleavage products could be detected unless a protease inhibitor was added to prevent degradation of HAo [63] . This difference between the sugar analogue and tunicamycin in the effect on the proteolytic stability of the non-glycosylated hemagglutinin is not understood. It has to be pointed out that it is difficult to make generalizations. Nakamura and Compans [47] found that the non-glycosylated form of the hemagglutinin that had been synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin without protease inhibitors could be detected in smooth membranes, when a different strain of influenza virus was studied in different host cells.

This is indicated by the observation that in the presence of glycosylation inhibitors the influenza virus hemagglutinin is incorporated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum and not found in the cytoplasm or on free ribosomes [37, 47] . Studies in an in vitro system have also shown that the glycoproteins of Semliki Forest virus can be incorporated into membranes in the presence of tunicamydn [20] . The unglycosylated influenza virus hemagglutinin is transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in the same manner as the glyeosylated compound [37, 47] . Studies on the effect of tunicamycin on the G protein of the Indiana strain of vesicular stomatitis virus have shown that here the molecule has the correct conformation for intracellular transport only when the carbohydrate side chains are present. However, the carbohydrate-free G protein of the Orsay strain of the same virus was transported under certain conditions. Thus, in this case the carbohydrate-free glycoprotein can acquire the correct conformation for transport [5, 21, 22] . These observations taken together indicate that the carbohydrate may or may not be involved in the intracellular transport of a viral glycoprotein. Furthermore, the data suggest that it depends on the amino acid sequence of a glycoprotein whether or not glycosylation is required.",

This has been shown for influenza virus [47] , herpes simplex virus [8] , and Rous sarcoma virus [63] . Different results, however, have been obtained with vesicular stomatitis virus.
