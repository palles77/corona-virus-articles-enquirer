In the organ cultures, the villous epithelium became detached and large numbers of coronavirus particles were seen by electron microscopy both in the medium and in thin sections of the intestinal epithelial cells, where the virus appeared to be multiplying. In organ cultures and in human embryo-kidney cells, intracytoplasmic virus was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence with convalescent serum from the patient. Coronavirus particles have been seen in samples from three outbreaks of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. The first (Weston) was among Service apprentices in 1965;6 the second (Bristol) was among hospital nurses in November, 1971; and the third (Somerset) outbreak affected nursery nurses in July, 1975 . Faecal samples from the first two outbreaks were inoculated into organ and cell cultures and the coronavirus seen in a faecal sample from the second outbreak is believed to have been propagated.",
