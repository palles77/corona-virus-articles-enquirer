The individual accounts given are also not comprehensive; details of symptoms, diagnosis and treatment should be sought in pathology text-books, a list of which is given at the end of the chapter. The accounts given are primarily of the aetiology of diseases, with particular reference to basic causes and predisposing factors, either in the animal or the environment. Even with this restriction the fact remains that some diseases have a most complicated aetiology, eg many nutritional disorders. Although these have been given more space than others less complicated, the reader must look elsewhere for more comprehensive accounts.",

Equally devastating can be diseases caused by malnutrition, poisoning, accidental injury, cancer, hereditary disease and stress. These will be considered before infectious diseases because they are in the main controlled by the good management practices that are essential before efficient control of infectious disease is possible. However, it must be noted that a disease may not fit into one category and one category only.

Undernourishment severe enough to lead to a well-defined and easily recognisable pathological condition, usually fatal, is primarily a result of very high nutrient requirements rather than low food intake. It is only when the food available is at a very low level, as in drought, that a high proportion of the flock or herd is affected. Even under these conditions the lactating animal can and does survive by reducing its milk production, and hence its food requirement.

Both types of cyst develop into tapeworms when eaten by dogs. At maturity the worms produce eggs that are passed in the faeces and eventually contaminate the dog's coat, pasture and market-garden produce. The hydatid egg may contaminate hands and household food and so lead to human hydatid disease -a serious, often fatal, condition. Because of risk of hydatid disease it is recommended that dogs are not fed any liver or lungs. (Cooking to destroy cysts is often carried out inadequately.)

Included among arthropod parasites are two relatives of spiders: ticks and mites. There are also three groups of insect: flies, fleas and lice. Most arthropod parasites are ectoparasites and feed either on skin and skin debris or by bloodsucking. Exceptions are mites, which make microscopic burrows in the skin, and the parasitic larvae of some flies, which penetrate quite deeply into the body. Harmful effects may be produced for one or more of the following reasons. Skin irritation. Biting flies, such as the stable fly, will cause distress through pain whereas the effect of sheep-biting lice (body lice), sandflies, mosquitoes and others is more subtle. In some cases the host may become allergic to the parasite. The harmful results of what appears to be minor irritation can be considerable. Animals may be prevented from grazing, handling of animals is made difficult, and constant scratching may injure hide, hair or wool. Skin damage may be seen where large, bloodsucking parasites pierce the skin in order to feed. Not only is the immediate health of the animal affected, but hide damage by cattle tick and demodectic mange can be particularly severe and will greatly affect the value of the hide. Damage to deeper tissues is mainly due to the feeding habits of parasitic fly larvae. In Australia, sheep are most commonly and most severely affected. Anaemia. Blood loss can be severe where very high parasite populations occur. Anaemia and death associated with severe tick or lice infestations of cattle are not uncommon. Disease transmission. Arthropods may, in addition to causing obvious physical damage, spread some very serious diseases. Certain viruses, bacteria and protozoa may be taken up by a bloodsucking parasite, survive and multiply within the parasite and later infect healthy animals at subsequent feedings.

There are cultivars of ryegrass which have no endophyte fungus. The fungus is transmitted through the seed. Storage of seed before sowing reduces the level of fungus in new pastures. Perennial ryegrass cultivars infected with the endophyte fungus are more resistant to drought and attack by pasture pests. Older pastures generally cause more problems than new pastures. The problem occurs in years when there is summer or early autumn rainfall which stimulates the ryegrass plants to shoot. If a dry period of several weeks then stresses the new growth, the production of lolitrem B increases. Sheep show nervous signs when disturbed, but recover if left alone. There is some concern that the fertility and lactation of ewes, and the survival of lambs, may be adversely affected on ryegrass pastures infected with endophyte. Clover growth is also reduced in pastures with ryegrass infected with endophyte.",

Two thorough applications of malathion powder spaced about three weeks apart provide another convenient method of lice control for small numbers of goats. Goats are not susceptible to blowfly strike, except very occasionally in the breech area in association with prolonged scouring. Internal parasites (roundworm, tapeworm and liver fluke) can be controlled, as in sheep, by drenching. Tapeworms are rarely a problem except, occasionally, in young kids, and liver flukes occur only in wet swampy areas. Roundworms, on the other hand, are widespread. Heavy infestations can seriously affect the health and productivity of goats of all ages and can be fatal, particularly in young animals. The frequency of drenching needed for worm control varies with rainfall and stocking rate, and a continual watch should be kept for signs of anaemia, scouring or loss of body and coat condition.

Windsuckers are generally poor doers and are not welcome in stables as they teach others the habit. Usually the front teeth are badly worn or rounded.
