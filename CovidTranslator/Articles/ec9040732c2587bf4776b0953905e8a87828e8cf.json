Jones et al. 5 suggest that local targeted surveillance of at-risk people may be the best way to prevent large-scale emergence. Brownstein et al. 6 in their discussion of web surveillance suggest that the use of news media and other non-traditional sources of surveillance data such as web-accessible discussion sites and disease reporting networks could facilitate early outbreak detection and increase public awareness of disease outbreaks prior to their formal recognition.

In 2006 a new avian H5N1, and in 2009, a new H1N1 'swine' influenza pandemic threat, caused widespread anxiety. 4 In addition to mortality and morbidity, zoonotic diseases have and are predicted to cause huge economic losses. The economic cost of the major outbreaks of new epidemic zoonotic diseases over the past decade, including SARS and H5N1 influenza, has been estimated to be $200 billion. 4 To prevent and control zoonotic infections in Southeast Asia (SE Asia), a multi-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach, involving many levels of the health and non-health sector, is needed, which pre-and post-intervention for seroconversion to assess vaccination coverage. Otherwise, vaccination coverage was estimated by the number of animals vaccinated directly and the number of dogs that accepted bait and subsequently punctured the container. Measurement of the success of the vaccination campaign in the study by Robinson was assessed using dog collars, paint marks or both. 67 Vaccination coverage is summarised as an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. It is worth noting that 18% of dogs included in this estimate as vaccinated did not have a vaccination marker but were self-reported by their owners as vaccinated during the campaign.

Fourteen studies 38, 44, 49, 55-57, 61, 64, 66, 69, 71, 72 used numbers of dengue cases or dengue incidence as an outcome.

Poor record keeping impacted on assessment of the system's timeliness. No other qualities of the system were evaluated (representativeness, positive predictive value). The studies on active surveillance systems evaluated systems based on community reporting 38, 39 and a sentinel GP surveillance pilot to detect suspected dengue cases. 41 The study by Osaka et al. 38 was inconclusive, as it seemed to be set up to look at the impact of concurrent interventions (done in conjunction with active surveillance) rather than improved surveillance, as both the intervention and control group received the active surveillance component. No information was provided on the increased cost of active surveillance. Oum et al. 39 used syndromic surveillance definitions to conduct community-based surveillance on a number of diseases, including \u2017haemorrhagic fever' (HF). Their evaluation showed value in their approach, as only 33% of cases of HF had contacted a health facility, with 67% of them being treated at home, although they do not estimate a predictive value positive (PPV) for their definition of HF. The majority of deaths (80%) also occurred at home. The surveillance system also detected two clusters of HF reported in one commune. Other system attributes were not evaluated. The sentinel GP pilot 41 compared a sensitive versus more specific case definition of suspected dengue cases presenting to two clinics. The more specific case definition uses diagnostic criteria for DHF outlined by the WHO, so it is not surprising that a higher proportion of patients were positive by serology (33% vs 7%) and virus isolation (50% vs 15%) using the latter case definition. Barbazan et al. used retrospective surveillance data to show that the spatial analysis would allow focusing control activities on 5% of the months to control 37% of cases, and early warning of epidemics could have been done in advance. 28 Chan et al. used web search query data to build a model that estimated \u2017true dengue activity'. 32 They showed good correlation of their predictive model with retrospective data using datasets from Indonesia and Singapore.",

Overall there was not a significant reduction in larval indices. The new tanks showed high levels of acceptability amongst the community. The other three studies looked at the effectiveness of environmental cleanup campaigns in combination with dengue education and awareness activities. 48, 70, 71 Crabtree et al. used a strategy based in schools and the general community with use of mass media and targeted activities to promote community awareness. 48 They found a 60% reduction in the number of households in the intervention area positive for Aedes aegypti, however, the vector was not present in the control area at baseline, which effectively meant that there was no control group. The number of households positive for Aedes aegypti increased toward the end of the study period. Suroso et al. used a predominantly school based strategy to promote clean up amongst the wider community. 70 They found a 50% reduction in larval indices in households, but only a 35% reduction in households with school children and school buildings. They concluded the program had been less successful amongst school children. Suwanbamrung et al. conducted their study in three semi-urban communities and used targeted community education activities to promote clean up campaigns. 71 They showed a 50% reduction in household index and an 80% reduction in container index in the village with high levels of community engagement and dengue control capacity. In the two villages where capacity and engagement were lower they demonstrated only a 15% reduction in these larval indices. None of these studies reported data on the cost of the intervention or provided follow up beyond one year to look at sustainability.",

Five of the studies which evaluated chemical methods of control also had an environmental cleanup component to the intervention to reduce vector breeding habitats. 47, 49, 59, 66, 76 There was no systematic difference in effectiveness between these studies and those not including this component. Three studies looked at the use of impregnated nets or curtains. 53, 59, 79 The two studies evaluating nets showed a significant reduction in adult vector indices 53 and larval vector indices 59 but were not able to show a reduction in dengue infections as measured by dengue serology. 53 Tun-Lin et al. 76 looked at the use of vector control programs targeted at the most productive container types versus untargeted control programs in urban settings in Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines (note that data from Viet Nam was excluded from the review as there was no follow up at this site). In the Philippines, two forms of environmental control were compared. Tyre splitting, water drum cleaning and waste management was compared to a general community clean up and awareness campaign. In Myanmar, introduction of biological agents (dragon-fly nymphs and fish) to the most productive water containers was compared to a blanket approach where all containers were targeted and chemical control (Temephos \u00a9 ) was used intermittently. In Thailand introduction of a biological larvicide (Bti) to the most productive containers was compared to use of chemical control (Temephos \u00a9 ) in productive containers, plus regular emptying of all other containers and occasional insecticide spraying. In all three countries both the targeted approach and the non-targeted approach were equally effective at reducing entomological indices (Breteau index) by 80% in Myanmar and the Philippines and 50% in Thailand. Implementation costs were reported for Myanmar and the Philippines. In Myanmar, the targeted vector control program had lower implementation costs ($4.47 per year per household covered) than the non-targeted campaign to which it was compared ($6.45 per year per household). In the Philippines, the targeted intervention had higher implementation costs compared to the non-targeted campaign ($9.32 v. $2.19 per year per household). In the Philippines high levels of acceptance of the interventions were reported. Coverage of 70% and 73.5% was achieved in the Philippines and Myanmar respectively.",

The study focuses on the use of staff electronic medical records for early detection of outbreaks of febrile illness. Although the study is conducted in medical staff at a large general hospital, it is included here as it is being used as an early detection system for outbreaks rather than solely to prevent nosocomial transmission. The study finds that as documented fever is rare in sick leave amongst staff, passive surveillance in healthcare workers would be efficient in identifying outbreaks of febrile illness. Effective markers were found to be clustering of illness, prolonged or repeated absence from work, or the incidence of abnormally high fevers. The authors conclude that such a system is practical and likely to be sensitive in this setting should appropriate indicators be chosen, but that currently the system is not specific. This may lead to many false alarms and ultimately to outbreak -fatigue\u2016 whereby people fail to respond to early warning signals.

They also saw a reduction in the number of secondary infections per case. Only 0.3% of those quarantined broke quarantine.

Ooi et al. also highlights that Singapore has particular features (small population, high GDP, urban setting) that facilitate the ability to implement large-scale quarantine and states that -imposition of large-scale quarantine should be implemented only under specific situations in which it is legally and logistically feasible\u2016. 63 Ooi et al. gives useful information about the public and individual response to the isolation and quarantine policy, stating that stigmatisation of quarantined individuals was reported. 63 Those quarantined were generally agreeable to being confined at home whilst the response was less positive to potential confinement in an institution such as a health centre. Finally, the study indicates that substantial resources were directed toward quarantined individuals, including repeat visits by nurses to deliver health education, the installation of electronic surveillance systems in each household to monitor compliance to quarantine orders, and the use of financial incentives to compensate individuals for lost income. All of these factors are likely to have contributed to the low rate of non-compliance reported in the study.",

The authors identified several constraints during the implementation of program that impacted on the success of the studylack of motivation of provincial staff, limited capacity of the central team to compile and analyse the data generated, weak diagnostic capabilities and the reluctance of farmers to have animals sampled.

With the advent of cheaper and safer human vaccines and the development of more economical regimes for human post-exposure treatment (PET), most Southeast Asian countries are able to administer PET through rabies treatment centres, hospitals and clinics similar to those discussed in the paper by Kamoltham, 54 and surveillance of human cases of rabies through these health provision settings would be a reasonable and feasible approach.",

Because of this, the studies are unable to estimate the independent effect of this particular intervention in stopping the outbreak, and no attempt has been made to analyse the size of the effect of confounding and interaction on the authors' results. Furthermore, although the system was sensitive (a quarter of all SARS cases had been on quarantine orders prior to diagnosis) it was not specific (only 0.5% of those isolated went on to develop SARS) making it highly resource intensive per SARS case detected.",

No information on KAP survey completed by participants; program assessed control of dengue vectors, but did not have effect on DHF rates, which are influenced by other factors (seasonal pattern, interaction from existing program) ; also mentions incidence DHF in the region small; failure to complete 2d course by some family leaders, substitution by other members; also mention family leaders had problems with filling in larval survey form, so means this information was self-reported rather than filled by trained staff Phan-Urai, 1995 65 Indices quoted below: pre-intervention, thereafter % reduction after treatment ( 85, 56.5, 62.4, 48.2, 69.4, 84.7, 84.7, 83.5, 69.4, 69.8* (*p<0.05) CI: 51.8, 71.0, 76.8, 73.0, 82.6, 92.3, 94.2, 96.1, 86.5, 84.1 BI: 76.0, 77.9, 69.3, 81.8, 82.8, 94.0, 95.1, 87.9, 84.4 Landing rate: 8.1, 43.2, 48.2, 88.9, 80.2, 66.7, Indices quoted below: pre-intervention, thereafter % reduction after treatment ( 5, 2.9, 20.2, 22.5, 11.2 CI: 44.8, 10.7, 28.6, 37.5, 44.2, 35.6 BI: 344.5, 16.1, 30.0, 44.8, 51.5, 43.1 Landing rate: 8.2, 35.4, 24.4, 51.2, 54.9, 30.2 Biting rate: 5.8, 36.2, 22.4, 48.3, 65.5, 41.5 Bti formulation effective and practical for control of Aedes aegypti larvae Pilot study of Bti in small number of households.

Limitations: 1. Number of cases of dengue, morbidity indicators and costs are all calculated based on ratio of dengue cases in intervention area relative to elsewhere in Cambodia, however, rates of dengue were very different in the two areas at baseline. 2. Epidemiologic data were not available below province level, meaning that 27.6% of the population who received the intervention were classed in the control group for outcome data. 3. data sources for dengue incidence came from hospital surveillance systems so would have missed many less severe cases. 4. in some control areas educational campaigns and distribution of temephos was undertaken by an NGO.

This is in contrast to Nam et al.'s evaluation of a biological and environmental control program in Viet Nam which cites the importance of recycling as an economic activity as one of the reasons why clean up campaigns were so successful in reducing entomological indices. Financial support for all the surveillance systems came, at least in part, from international donors or commercial organisations. The study which evaluated the use of internet sources for rumour surveillance was sponsored by Google who provided access to the data and technical support. 32 Two studies commented on financial constraints to their surveillance system; Chairulfatah et al. reported that they could only perform serology tests as opposed to the more definitive recovery of virus tests in their system, 31 whilst Osaka et al. reports that an extension of their system beyond a pilot would likely require use of cheaper serology testing. Adequate investment and resourcing for both start up and maintenance was also frequently identified as an important factor for prevention and control interventions. Beckett et al. states that their budget was too low to enable them to reach all community members with their educational intervention. 45 Eamchan et al. reports the high price of larvicidal agents (specifically Temephos \u00a9 ) as a potential barrier for ongoing use. 49 Swaddiwudhipong et al. which had included this as part of their intervention was forced to drop it during the final (and epidemic) year of their intervention due to a lack of funds.",

In their evaluation of an educational intervention, Therawiwat et al. report that interaction between key stakeholders and researchers enhanced reflection and dialogue amongst stakeholders. However,Oum et al.  reports that there was tension between the village health volunteers (VHV) used in their surveillance system and official health staff who were often not receptive to the VHVs efforts.Tun-Lin et al. found that the targeted intervention used in Myanmar was less costly but equally effective as a non-targeted strategy, whilst in the Philippines, where a strong social intervention component was included in the program, the targeted intervention cost almost five times more than the non-targeted intervention for comparable levels of effectiveness in regards to reduction of vector indices. 76 Kittyayapong et al. report that whilst targeted vector control could feasibly be rolled out beyond a research program in their Thailand setting it was likely to be too costly to implement.",

Educational intervention evaluated by a qualitative survey using friend (14.6% to 30.6%, p<0.001), Throw away dead poultry (4.1% to 1.8%, p<0.001) Wash hands after slaughtering (97.8% to 94.2%, p<0.001) Seek immediate treatment if develop fever after contact with poultry (86.3% to 90.2%, p<0.001)Multi-variate analysis showed that KAP scores influenced by initial score, education level and the intervention. Having a higher education level was strongly correlated with largest difference in KAP score, and score of medical intervention for patients with H5N1 avian influenza infection. Study indicated that habits such as touching and eating dead/sick poultry were reported at both pre-and postintervention. Main impact of educational intervention was to increase people's trust in local healthcare providers Interest in avian influenza increased.",
