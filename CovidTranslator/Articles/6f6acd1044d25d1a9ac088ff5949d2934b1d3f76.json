The recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic confirmed the need for mitigation strategies that are cost-effective and easy to implement. Typically, in the early stages of a pandemic, as seen with pandemic (H1N1) 2009, vaccines and antivirals may be limited or non-existent, resulting in the need for nonpharmaceutical strategies to reduce the spread of disease and the economic impact. We construct and analyze a mathematical model for a population comprised of three different age groups and assume that some individuals wear facemasks. We then quantify the impact facemasks could have had on the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and examine their cost effectiveness. Our analyses show that an unmitigated pandemic could result in losses of nearly $832 billion in the United States during the length of the pandemic. Based on present value of future earnings, hospital costs, and lost income estimates due to illness, this study estimates that the use of facemasks by 10%, 25%, and 50% of the population could reduce economic losses by $478 billion, $570 billion, and $573 billion, respectively. The results show that facemasks can significantly reduce the number of influenza cases as well as the economic losses due to a pandemic.",

The emergence of an unexpected or novel strain of influenza poses problems in combating the spread of infection. Vaccines are typically the first line of defense against influenza viruses (Germann et al., 2006) , however, in the case of novel viruses vaccines may not be readily available. In addition to vaccines, public health campaigns encouraging good hygiene have been used to reduce the spread of influenza.",

            "text": "During the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak several non-pharmaceutical mitigation strategies were used including school closures, social distancing, and facemasks (Condon and Sinha, 2009) . Influenza spreads through person-to-person contact via airborne particles as well as by direct and indirect (e.g., via fomites) contacts. Several studies have shown that facemasks can be an effective mitigation strategy. A recent study on facemasks and hand hygiene showed a 10 -50% transmission reduction for influenza-like illnesses (Aiello et al., 2010) . Other studies have also shown that facemasks can not only act as a barrier (Del Valle et al., 2010) but they can redirect and decelerate exhaled air flows to prevent them from entering the breathing zones of others (Tang and Settles, 2009) . Several laboratory studies on mask effectiveness have shown that N95 respirators are 21.5% effective in protecting against the inhalation of nanoparticles, while surgical masks were only 2.4% effective (an Lee et al., 2008) . However, a study by Loeb et al. (Loeb et al., 2009) found that surgical masks and N95 respirators offered about the same percentage of protection for nurses in hospitals. Although several studies have shown that both surgical masks and N95 provide similar protection against influenza, a recent editorial by Killingley (Killingley, 2011) discusses two studies and argues that the results are still inconclusive and that more research is needed. For our model we will focus on N95 respirators since we are interested in analyzing optimal interventions, however, our analyses may be applicable to surgical masks based on Loeb et al. (Loeb et al., 2009 ) results. Using a mathematical model, Tracht et al. (Tracht et al., 2010) analyzed the effectiveness of facemasks in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. They compared the impact that surgical and N95 masks could have on reducing the spread of influenza. Their results showed that facemasks can be an effective intervention strategy for mitigating an airborne disease. We expand upon that model by dividing the population into three age groups and quantifying the impact of facemasks (also referred to as N95 respirators) have on the spread of the disease as well as their cost effectiveness.",

People alternate between mask and non-mask groups based on the number of individuals infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009. We also separate the population into three different age group classifications: children between ages 0-17 (superscript 1), adults between ages 18-64 (superscript 2), and seniors older than 65 (superscript 3). Individuals are characterized by their epidemiological status: susceptible, S k and , exposed, E k and (i.e., people who are infected but not yet fully contagious), and infectious individuals, I k and , where k = 1 (ages 0-17), 2 (ages 18-64) and 3 (ages 65+). Definitions of the epidemiological classes are summarized in Table 1 and the transfers are shown diagrammatically in Figure 1 .

All simulations assume that there are 1,800 infectious children, 2,000 infectious adults, and 100 infectious seniors in a total population of 302 million at the beginning of the epidemic, and all other individuals are susceptible. Note that in Tracht et al.

Masks are implemented after after 30,200 cases of pandemic (H1N1) are reported. For sensitivity analysis on the impact of delays in the implementation of masks, see Tracht et al. (Tracht et al., 2010) . Figure 2 shows the epidemic curve for each of the three initial uncontrolled effective reproduction numbers when there are no intervention strategies in use. Table 4 shows the numerical results for the number of cumulative cases, deaths, and hospitalizations for each scenario when there are no interventions (no masks worn).

One of the policy implications of our results is that people should consider wearing masks, as it is typically done in some Asian countries, to prevent the spread of airborne viruses. Facemasks are not only inexpensive, but are easy to implement and less costly than most other mitigation strategies. N95 respirators come in varying sizes, ranging from extra small to large, thus is would be feasible for people to buy them based on their face size. Although we used N95 respirators as the basis for out analyses, recent studies (Loeb et al., 2009 ) have shown that surgical masks and N95 respirators can provide similar protection. We can conclude from our model that facemasks are an effective intervention strategy in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and are an extremely costeffective tool to reduce economic losses due to illness.

In this case, waves are produced because the intervention strategy is temporarily halted and restarted, e.g., if the number of infectious individuals drops below 30,200 reported cases, people stop wearing masks. Once the number of infectious individuals reaches 30,200 cases people start to wear masks again. Note that in this scenario the epidemic never dies out and the number of infectious individuals continues to oscillate between 29,400 and 32,500. Part a shows the results for age specific compliance.

Note that the compliance rates of the children and seniors do not appear to decrease the disease spread, but the compliance rates of adults greatly reduces the number of cases.

Part b shows the net savings when one group is not wearing masks and 25% of the other two remaining groups wearing masks. If adults do not wear facemasks, net savings are reduced. Part c shows net savings when there are a limited number of masks available.
