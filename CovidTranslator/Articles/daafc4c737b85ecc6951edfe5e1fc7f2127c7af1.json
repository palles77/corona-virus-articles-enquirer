The work of Zaki et al. on respiratory samples from the first patient demonstrated that there was efficient viral replication in monkey cell lines. Apart from SARs, most other coronaviruses do not replicate well in this medium [2] . Indirect immunofluorescence assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for respiratory viruses including influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and paramyxoviruses were negative, but PCR assay for the coronavirus family indicated the expected fragments [2] . Viral genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis subsequently revealed a MERS CoV in the beta-coronavirus genus, of lineage C, unlike SARS which belongs to lineage B [2] .",

They infected six macaque monkeys with MERS CoV causing acute pneumonia and subsequently reisolated the virus from lung tissue. MERS CoV is able to infect a broad range of mammalian cells and does not require the same receptor that restricted SARS primarily to lung tissue [7] . An interesting feature in the UK cluster was coinfection with other viruses, influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 in the index case, and type 2 parainfluenza virus in both the secondary cases [5] . This may highlight an important biological characteristic of MERS CoV or may merely reflect the presence of multiple respiratory viruses circulating ubiquitously in winter. Nevertheless, this finding has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to adjust their screening criteria. They currently advise clinicians to test for MERS CoV even if alternate etiologies are identified, especially if clinical findings are incompletely explained by that etiology [8] .",

The striking difference is that the same number of H7N9 cases have occurred within the space of a month compared to 6 months with MERS CoV. Unlike SARS or MERS CoV, we have antiviral medications that could work against H7N9, and the hope of a vaccine being developed and brought to commercial quantities within 6 months. There are no proven vaccines or antiviral treatments against SARS even 10 years on, nor against the newly discovered MERS CoV. Without effective vaccines or therapeutics, classic public health interventions for outbreak controlisolation, quarantine and social distancingmay still remain the only effective countermeasures to stop new SARS and MERS CoV outbreaks, if sustained humanto-human transmissions occurs. Continued investment in research and preparedness is needed, but eternal vigilance may indeed be the price of safety from emerging infections and novel pathogens.",
