[11] [12] [13] Horses affected by ECoV and Salmonella can have indistinguishable clinical signs including fever, anorexia, abnormal fecal character, malaise, and colic. 6, 7, 9, 14 Thus, our objective was to compare clinical features associated with ECoV infection to those associated with Salmonella infection in a population of ill horses. A secondary objective was to identify a clinical signature of ECoV infection in horses. We hypothesized that adult horses with ECoV infection would more likely to be leukopenic than would horses diagnosed with Salmonella infection. All data were entered into a digital collection sheet. Patient data collected included signalment, month and year of presentation, and presenting complaint.

The next most common clinical signs were colic and diarrhea, and the combination of fever with colic or diarrhea likely prompted clinicians to perform fecal diagnostic testing because these clinical signs are highly associated with a positive diagnosis of Salmonella in horses.

However, no significant differences in platelet count or protein concentration were found among groups. This finding is in contrast to a report from an ECoV outbreak that documented thrombocytopenia in 25% and hypoproteinemia in 0% of cases. 3 Our case sample population was taken from a tertiary care referral hospital, and it is possible that our cases represent individuals that are most severely affected thus prompting referral for hospitalization. Additional work is needed to establish whether thrombocytopenia or hypoproteinemia are consistent features of ECoV infection.",

In addition, we found no differences in clinical or hematologic abnormalities among horses diagnosed with ECoV and Salmonella. Therefore, the results of our study suggest that ECoV should be included in the differential diagnoses for horses presenting with fever, anorexia, intestinal disease, and neutropenia. Molecular diagnostic testing for both ECoV and Salmonella should be performed to aid diagnosis and improve hospital and on-farm biosecurity measures in these cases.",

No significant differences in likelihood of abnormal feces were found among groups. Of all included horses, the highest number presented in the fall (14/42; 33%) and the fewest presented in the spring (6/42; 14%). No significant difference was found among groups in seasonal distribution of cases (Figure 1). Hematocrit data were available for all horses in the study. The median hematocrit was 41.4% (range, 31.5%-50.2%) for horses with ECoV, 34.9% (range, 29.9%-46.9%) for horses with Salmonella, and 36.6% (range, 23%-69%) for UNK horses. No significant differences were noted among any of the groups. Leukogram data are presented in Figures 2 and 3. Among the horses diagnosed with ECoV, 5 of 8 (62.5%) were leukopenic on presentation (Figure 2). Differential cell counts were available for 5 horses and indicated that all 5 (100%) horses were neutropenic and 3 of 5 (60%) were lymphopenic (Figure 3A,B). Four of 8 (50%) horses were thrombocytopenic (Figure 3C), and none had abnormal fibrinogen concentrations (Figure 3D). For horses diagnosed with Salmonella, 11 of 12 (92%) were leukopenic(Figure 2). Differential cell counts were available for 10 horses and indicated that 9 of 10 (90%) were neutropenic and 6 of 10 (60%) were lymphopenic (Figure 3A,B). Four of 11 (36%) were thrombocytopenic (Figure 3C), and 3 of 9 (33%) had hyperfibrinogenemia (Figure 3D). Only 11 of 22 (50%) of UNK horses were leukopenic on presentation (Figure 2). Differential cell counts were available for 19 horses and indicated that 10 of 19 (53%) horses were neutropenic and 9 of 19 (47%) horses were lymphopenic (Figure 3A,B). Eight of 22 (36%) horses were thrombocytopenic (Figure 3C) and 2 of 19 (10.5%) horses had hyperfibrinogenemia (Figure 3D).",

Manship). Inclusion criteria were age >1 year, fecal PCR testing for ECoV, and at least 1 positive or at least 3 negative selective fecal culture for Salmonella. A case was classified as ECoV positive if 1 fecal PCR was positive. A case was classified as Salmonella positive if at least 1 selective fecal culture for Salmonella was positive. A case was classified as having an unknown diagnosis (UNK) if 1 fecal PCR was negative for ECoV and at least 3 selective fecal cultures were negative for Salmonella. Horses hospitalized for gastrointestinal surgery were excluded from analysis. Fecal diagnostic testing was initiated according to the infectious disease policy of the hospital or at the discretion of the attending clinician. Five consecutive fecal cultures for Salmonella are recommended for horses with diarrhea (defined as 3 consecutive fecal piles that do not sit on top of the bedding) or a combination of fever (defined as a rectal temperature >39.2 C in the absence of recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] use or >38.9 C in a horse that has received NSAIDs within the last 24 hours) and neutropenia (defined as a neutrophil count <2000 cells/\u03bcL) without clinical signs of respiratory disease. Diagnostic recommendations were made based on historical data or data collected during examination. Some horses were discharged before completion of sample collection for the sequential Salmonella cultures according to the owner's request.",

Clinicopathologic data from presentation was selected for comparison because it was the most complete data set for horses meeting the inclusion criteria, although results of a differential cell count were only available for 5 of 8 ECoV horses.Temporal data analysis may have allowed us to identify clinical features unique to ECoV infection and should be pursued in future studies.An additional limitation to our study is that we did not allow for the possibility that horses could be coinfected with both Salmonella and ECoV. The ECoV PCR became commercially available in 2010 butwas not yet widely performed in our clinic on horses with febrile enteric disease, and so this test was not performed on 7 horses that were culture positive for Salmonella.7 In addition, 1 horse was admitted with a history of positive ECoV PCR, and thus no additional diagnostic tests were performed. For the remaining 5 horses with Salmonella and 7 of the ECoV-positive horses, all testing was performed and no horse was positive for >1 pathogen. Consistent with our data, prior work has failed to document coinfection with ECoV and Salmonella in outbreaks of ECoV in adult horses.3,6 A diagnosis was not reached for 22 of 42 horses included in our study. As discussed, some of these horses may have been misclassified because of decreased diagnostic sensitivity associated with small numbers of fecal cultures and PCR test results. However, this number is comparable to previous reports in which approximately 60% of acute colitis cases had no definitive diagnosis.18 Although the focus of our investigation was to compare the clinicopathologic findings of horses testing positive for ECoV and Salmonella spp., the majority of horses included in the study (31 of 42 in total) and 21 of 22 UNK had a single fecal PCR test for a number of common enteric pathogens (Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, Lawsonia intracellularis, and Neorickettsia risticii). The 1 UNK horse without fecal PCR testing was tested for C. difficile toxins A and B by ELISA. All horses were negative for other pathogens. The total leukocyte counts of our UNK horses suggest 2 separate populations, with 1 group having higher than normal white blood cell counts. This observation may suggest that either there are some unidentified pathogens causing enteric disease in adult horses or that some horses are presented to the clinic after immunologic clearance of the offending pathogen and during the recovery phase. Further investigation is warranted into other potential infectious causes of febrile enteric disease in adult horses.",
