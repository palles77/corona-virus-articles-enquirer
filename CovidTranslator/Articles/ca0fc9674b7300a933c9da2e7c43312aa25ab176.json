In the Tangail District of central Bangladesh, people drink the raw juice of date palms, normally procured by gachis or tree people (from the Bangla word gach, meaning tree).

They are part of this world and while some of these microorganisms are potential pathogens most live in peace, and we can't simply get rid of them all. The most important thing we can do is be ready, so that whenever a new zoonotic disease emerges, we are able to quickly identify the pathogens involved and their reservoirs, understand the triggers for spill-over events and, ultimately, contain the disease. This will need to be an integral part of national surveillance systems, especially in countries with high risk of disease emergence, \" he says.",

Some years later the first human reports of Zika virus started to appear.But humans are not the only victims of the killing scourge caused by these viruses. In November 2016, the Netherlands killed over 190,000 ducks, Sweden 200,000 chickens, Germany about 100,000 turkeys and chickens, and more recently South Korea has killed about 7 million chicken and ducks. Why? Because of an influenza scare. The H5N8 influenza virus was detected in these unfortunate birds and culling was the best way to eliminate the virus from the population and prevent further spread, explains Thomas C. Mettenleiter, president of the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health in Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.\"The destruction of the captive birds from infected holdings is performed to eliminate the virus from the poultry population and prevent further spread (and even more killings), \" says Mettenleiter.Luckily for us, H5N8 is so far only known to infect birds. But other influenza strains have made the jump into humans, such as H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2 and H1N1. The infamous H1N1 strain of 1918 infected nearly 500 million people, killing at least 50 million. A similar strain made a comeback recently, between April 2009 and August 2010, causing 18,500 laboratoryconfirmed deaths and as many as half a million deaths related to the disease around the world, according to a 2012 report 4 .",
