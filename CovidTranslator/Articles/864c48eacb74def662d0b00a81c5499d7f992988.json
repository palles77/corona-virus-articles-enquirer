Some scientists wrote articles and gave lectures, calling for heightened vigilance for the pilfering act, and proposed that the country protect its precious genetic resources by conducting genetic research on its own. While the public might have been completely flummoxed by some esoteric and arcane jargons, the message was nonetheless loud and clear: the Western capitalists were trying to profit from China's unique genetic heritage. In a country with a past history of repeated foreign invasion, defeat, and humiliation, this message struck a tender emotional chord and caused an eruption of national furor.",

            "text": "Some biotech companies quickly saw the potential of enormous business opportunities and joined the fray. Human Genome Sciences, founded in 1992 by William A. Haseltine, a noted Harvard professor and AIDS researcher, partnered with some genomics companies and soon filed patents on 100,000 genes 1 and, in 1999, quadrupled its stock price (Zimmer 2009 ). Other genomics companies followed suit. Yet this practice had one problem: most, if not all, patented ''genes,'' in fact, RNA transcripts, were merely pieces of cDNA without any known functions at the time of filing. To understand what a gene does and how it does, and to establish the causal relationship between a gene and a human disease, let alone treatment, is by no means an easy task, even with modern technology. Very often, it is a slow, arduous, painstaking, and imprecise process full of dead-ends and false leads. Many other biotech companies and academic scientists took a different approach called ''positional cloning.'' This approach eliminates the need to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the disease of interest. Instead, through the collection of pedigrees enriched with patients having the disease, the existing genetic sign posts (called DNA markers, which are scattered around the human genome with known locations and content) would be used to localize the responsible gene in a particular region. 2 This would allow researchers to zero in the gene, identify it, and ultimately figure out its function and its relationship with the disease through extensive lab work. Thus, by ''positioning'' the gene, the gene could be cloned and its functions and roles in disease pathogenesis elucidated without any prior knowledge of the possible pathogenesis of the disease. 3 This conceptual simplicity and beauty, coupled with increasingly fast and affordable methods of making genetic signposts (called ''genotyping'') attracted many biomedical scientists and even converted many of them This discovery was later found to hold universally true in all organisms, including humans, and became a corner stone and a principle in genetics. Basically, if a trait is determined by a gene, then the gene will tend to go hand in hand with its neighboring signposts when transmitted from parents to offspring-thus the term ''linkage.'' If many relatives in a pedigree having the same trait all carry the same signposts, then there is a chance that the gene responsible for the trait is near to the signposts. Although different cross-breeding cannot be made in humans for obvious reasons, this difficulty can be offset by statistical computations. The advent of personal computers in the 1980s coincided with the booming of human genetics and proved to be indispensable in this endeavor. The discovery of various classes of DNA markers also facilitated the gene hunting. 3 The approach based on pedigree data is called ''linkage analysis.'' Since 1997, scientists found that for common diseases, another approach, called ''association studies,'' can be more powerful in gene hunting. Association studies identify disease genes by finding the significant gene frequency differentials between a group of unrelated healthy individuals and another group of unrelated people with the disease of interest.",

Thus, in the 1990s hardly a week went by without a news report or announcement of the discovery of genes for some disease, at least in the US. One high-profile study, published in 1993 in a prestigious journal, Science, reported the localization of a gene in chromosome X 28q that is responsible for male sexual orientation. 4 This approach has one catch, however. One critical prerequisite for position cloning is the availability of a sufficient number of pedigrees saturated with people having the same disease, along with correct diagnoses or precise measurements of the disease (called ''phenotyping''). Once such pedigrees are collected, phenotyping and genotyping can proceed and the positional cloning endeavor can start. Since genotyping and phenotyping a large number of people can be costly, there are strong incentives to cut the cost of either process. Everything else equal, locations with low costs of acquiring blood samples (for genotyping purposes) and labor (for phenotyping purposes) would be extremely attractive.",

It analyzed DNA collected from about 300 people on Tristan da Cunha, an island in the south Atlantic, about 1,500 miles from South Africa. Approximately 30% of the island residents had asthma, presumably passed on from an original settler generations ago. The announcement prompted cash payments of $2 million from Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany, based on a prior agreement. Boehringer later paid Sequana an additional $13 million for its exclusive right to market the drug derived from the putative asthma gene, while Sequana retained the exclusive right for developing gene-based diagnostics. Sequana announced in late May 1997 that it had identified a mutated gene that predisposes people to asthma, a feat hailed by one clinical investigator as ''perhaps this century's most important finding in the etiology of asthma'' (Asthma gene discovered. 1997). Early in the same year, Sequana announced that it had signed a letter of intent with PE Applied Biosystems to form a broad-based DNA sequencing joint venture in Shanghai, China.",

In November 1996, about 30 leading Chinese biomedical and genetic researchers gathered in Xiang Shan, Beijing, and held a conference on ''The Human Genome Project and the Development Strategy for the 21 st -Century Medicine'' to evaluate and discuss the situation. 6 One incident further fueled the concern shared by all participants. A translated version of a Science article was presented at the conference, which stated that Xu sought to gain ''access to 200 million Chinese through collaboration with six Chinese medical centers.'' But in the Chinese version, the program became one that would ''take blood samples from 200 million Chinese'' (Hui and Jue 1997) .",

This, along with the media furor, duly alarmed the central government. In 1998, the Office for Management of China's Human Genetic Resources was quickly established under the auspice of the Ministry of Science and Technology, and charged with overseeing the handling and export of all biological specimens potentially containing genetic materials. Soon a de facto law, The Interim Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources, promulgated by the General Office of the State Council (Ministry of Science and Technology & the Ministry of Public Health, 1998), was enacted in June 1998. It mandated that genetic resources were not allowed to be taken abroad without explicit permission and observance of due procedures as defined in the Interim Measures. Funding for domestic human genetic research subsequently poured in (Swinbanks 1998), which spurred human genetics research in China (Du et al. 2001) .

In particular, the research in genetic epidemiology of asthma and hypertension is now at the forefront in the world'' ([Benefiting thousands and thousands of families.] 2002). In another report, it said that ''Harvard's project has so far produced 8 postdocs, 4 doctoral students, 20 visiting scholars, and 4 senior investigators'' ([East and West collaborate for the health of humankind.] 2001). In Xu's hometown, the provincial newspaper reported, after enumerating various human genetics research projects with Harvard, that ''these collaborative projects not only injected new vitality to Anhui's science and technology but also helped attract investment in the amount of about 50 million ''Gene War of the Century'' and Its Aftermath 499 RBM Yuan'' ([Anhui-native scientist climb peak of human genetics.] 2002).

Xu's preference for dealing with the high-rank officials, however, went overboard and nearly caused his undoing (see below). As Xu's various gene-hunting projects in Anhui took off, some disturbing incidents involved in these projects gradually surfaced and leaked to the press. Participants were initially promised by the research team that they would get free or reduced-cost medical care, but these promises were never honored. Informed consent supposed to be obtained from potential participants actually was not-a flagrant violation of NIH regulations. Rumors circulated regarding coercion by local officials to participate in the projects, sample mishandling and mix-ups in the lab.",

An intense debate ensued, starting with Xu's Anhui collaborators, who maintained that the rate of getting informed consent was close to 100%, and that the Chinese side did reap benefits from the collaboration with the Harvard team. But their presentation was confronted by incensed Chinese scientists, who questioned their numbers and practice.

Defending himself as a patriot, Xu's letter suggested that the Outlook report had released state secrets to ''foreigners'' (Pomfret 2001b) .

If he continued his campaign against journalists and others who questioned his research, the letter said, Xu would face ''appropriate sanction'' (Pomfret 2001b ).",

It found that many of the informed consent documents approved by the HSPH IRB included complex language that would not be comprehensible to all subjects, particularly for rural Chinese subjects. HSPH was charged with failing to minimize risks to their vulnerable subjects, such as economically or educationally disadvantaged persons. In the end, subjects never even received the free medical care as promised. As a result of the indictment, Xu was ordered to suspend all human subject interventions in his active studies pending the outcome of an internal audit.

When responding to a question from a student in the audience regarding Harvard's projects in Anhui, Summers admitted that some irregularities in the projects were ''wrong.'' Xu eventually breathed a sigh of relief when OHRP sent a letter to HSPH in early May 2003, stating that all issues raised in the HSPH-involved China studies have been either resolved or dissolved because of unsubstantiated allegations (as in alleged forged informed consent documents). Consequently, ''there should be no need for further involvement of OHRP'' in these matters. Notably, the letter acknowledged that Xu had decided not to continue the hypertension study due to OHRP's concern that some of the interventions in the protocol exceeded the level of minimal risk. Shortly afterwards, HSPH held a press release announcing the ''[c]onclusion of U.S. Government's Inquiry into HSPH Genetic Research in China. '' 11 Soon after the HSPH news release, one Internet article, by Xiong Lei, alleged complacency and a likely cover-up on the part of the Chinese government. It raised several issues (Xiong 2003) . First, among the 15 Harvard projects in China that the OHRP found to have problems, 12 projects were headed by Xu. Yet officially, only 3 of Xu's projects had ever been approved by the government. Hence there was a glaring discrepancy. Second, the official from the Office for Management of Human Genetic Resources, who was in charge of the investigation of the allegation of irregularities in Xu's projects, told Xiong privately that it was not an official investigation. However, the same official then turned around and told the American Embassy that no violation was found. It was rather strange that the results of this unofficial investigation, which was shielded from the media and the public, would then be used by the Americans to prove that there are no irregularities in these projects. Lastly, one peasant in Anhui whose ordeal led to the exposure of apparent lapses in informed consent later recanted his story after talking with officials from Anhui and the Central government. Presumably, he changed his story because of pressure he experienced. This changed story explained why the OHRP eventually found no wrong-doings in Xu's projects (Xiong 2003) .",

In fact, the US government recently decided that human and other genes should not be eligible for patents because they are part of nature (Pollack 2010) . This move, viewed as ''a bit of a landmark, kind of a line in the sand,'' followed a surprising ruling made in March 2010, by Judge Robert W. Sweet of the United States District Court in Manhattan, which ruled the patents held by Myriad Pharmaceuticals and the University of Utah on two genes that predispose women to breast and ovarian cancer invalid (Pollack 2010 ). On June 13, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Association for Molecular Pathology vs. Myriad Genetics that ''naturally occurring'' DNA sequences, but not lab-created synthetic cDNAs, are off-limits for patent protection.",

In fact, when the process of deciding who would get resources lacks procedural justice, and when there is a lack of tradition for open and rational debate and of a checks-and-balances system, the credibility contest becomes literally a ''beauty'' contest-the most glamorous, in terms of rank, status, or simply seniority in the administrative ladder, but not necessarily the vision, merit, or talent, would get the resources. In a country where political loyalty and connections are valued far more than scientific merit and talent, the credibility contest further becomes a contest of political correctness or patriotism. Coupled with the lack of a clean and efficient government and of transparency and also with the pervasiveness of Guanxi or personal connections, this contest might create winners who are not necessarily the scientifically most visionary. As human beings, scientists are also susceptible to all human frailties. Aside from questing for epistemic authority, they also compete for resources and influence, and often vie for political clout, credit, fame, and even glamour, especially when such activities help their quest for epistemic authority or increase their professional and personal gains. If there are no set rules of the game with certain procedural justice or a checks-and-balances system in place that can curtail the tendency and channel it into the maximization of the common good, the human frailties, coupled with the lack of proper avenues for open debate, the contest would be an invitation for inefficiency, waste, corruption, and even disaster. Winners might take all, but in the long run the bad money drives out the good. The spectacular fiasco in containing the SARS epidemic and in sequencing the coronavirus that causes SARS are a prime example (Enserink 2003; Cao 2004) .",

It reached a historical high of 868.7 billion Yuan, or about 133.6 billion US dollars, in 2011, amounting to 1.84% of China's GDP. 19 As a result, China's scientific output, measured by the number of papers published in international journals, also has increased remarkably and is reportedly ranked as the second in the world, just behind the US. 20 Yet in terms of average number of citations-a rough measure of impact or research quality, China was ranked a distant 14 th . A more disconcerting observation is that the fruit of biomedical research seldom translates into better patient care, better therapeutics, better prognostics, or better prevention. In other words, the vast majority of tax-payers have not received any tangible benefit from the supposedly noble and grandiose scientific endeavor. This situation, if left unchanged, is not going to justify for heavy investment in biomedical research and to win the continued support from tax-payers in the long-run. Ultimately, it would raise the issue of sustainability of biomedical research in China. This problem will become all the more acute as China enters into an aging society in which health care cost will surely skyrocket.",

Geneticists from China, France, Germany, Japan, and United Kingdom participated in this project and, along with the US, formed an international consortium. The sequencing work was divided among all members, with China responsible for 1% of the whole human genome The news that Harvard's genetics projects are launched in Anhui broke out in Science Xiang Shan Conference was held in November 1997: Articles and reports that Western companies are coming to China to hunt down disease genes began to appear in professional journals and newspapers. The phrase, ''gene war,'' first appeared in the media Sequana announced in May that it has identified a mutated gene that makes people susceptible to asthma 1998: Several international collaborative projects were halted pending official approval The Interim Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources came into effect. No biospecimen containing DNA and/or RNA can be taken out of China without approval 1999: Several incidents/irregularities involved in Xu's Anhui projects surfaced A fact-finding team of six persons from Harvard went to Anhui to investigate but found nothing improper The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) launched its own investigation of Harvard's genetic research in China 2000: The draft version of the human genome sequences was completedWashington Post ran a lengthy report detailing the allegations that Chinese villagers had not been given low-cost medical care as they were promised in exchange for providing blood samples for Xu's US-funded genetic research. The report also included allegations that Xu's lapsed in informed consent 2001: An investigative report was published in Outlook, a major Chinese magazine. The report reiterated some of the allegations made in an earlier report published in the Washington Post and supplemented them with interviews with Chinese farmers in an isolated region of Anhui province and their various predicaments A face-to-face confrontation erupted regarding various irregularities in Xu's projects at the Symposium on Bioethics, Biotechnology and Biosecurity held in Hangzhou, ChinaChina's Office for Management of Human Genetic Resources launched its own investigation, but soon concluded that Xu's projects did not break any Chinese regulations, and told the US Embassy soThe Dean of the HSPH sent a scathing letter to Xu, strongly criticizing him for writing two letters to senior Chinese government officials, in which Xu urged the government to silence the voice from his detractors and to take actions against a major figure who had criticized his work 2002: The federal Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) of the DHHS issued a scathing indictment of the HSPH research",
