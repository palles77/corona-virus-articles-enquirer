Nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Due to the lack of specific antibodies to detect the localization of endogenous proteins in macrophages, plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged Atg5, Atg12, and Atg16L1 were transfected with a modified MNV reverse genetic construct into mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) (Figure 6 ). At 24 hrs after transfection, the cells were fixed/permeabilized as described above. Cells were then stained with mouse anti-FLAG and rabbit anti-propol antibody in blocking buffer (PBS/0.2% TritionX-100/1% normal goat serum) at RT for 1 hr and then stained with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit antibodies.

            "text": "STORM Setup and Imaging. The STORM microscope was constructed around a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope operating in wide-field epifluorescence mode and using the Nikon Perfect Focus system for focus stabilization. The activation/imaging lasers (CUBE 405nm-50, Sapphire 561nm-150, Sapphire 460-10 from Coherent and Stradus 642nm-110 from Vortran Laser) were individually shuttered by a mechanical shutter (Uniblitz LS3ZM2, Vincent Associates) and an acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF, PCAOM, Crystal technology). Laser lines were combined, expanded and collimated before being focused at the back focal plane of a 100x objective (100X UPlanSApo NA 1.4, Olympus). A quad band dichroic mirror (zt405/488/561/640rpc from Chroma) and a band-pass filter (ET705/70m, Chroma) separated the fluorescence signal collected by the same objective from the excitation light. Images were recorded with an EMCCD camera (iXon Plus DU897, Andor) and a Dual View system (Photometrics DV2) inserted between the microscope and the camera as an image relay. The Dual View splitting cassette was replaced with a cylindrical lens (1M focal length) to create the astigmatism for 3D imaging. MEF cells were plated on a No. 1.5 coverglass, transfected and processed for immunofluorecense as described above. Secondary antibodies for STORM were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch and custom conjugated with photoswitchable dye pairs as described before (Bates et al., 2007) . Imaging was performed by inverting coverslips onto a glass slide with imaging buffer (80:10:10:1 ratio of DPBS, 1 M mercaptoethylamine (pH 8.5), 50% glucose solution, and an antibeaching oxygen scavenger system (10 mg of glucose oxidase + 25 ml of catalase and 100 ul of DPBS). Excess buffer was drained and edges of coverglass were sealed with nailpolish before image acquisition. Astigmatism STORM imaging (Huang et al., 2008) allowed us to observe the distribution of these proteins in 3D.",

At 8 hrs post infection, cells were treated with 40\u00b5M cycloheximide and 10\u00b5M anisomycin and harvested at 0, 2, 3 and 4 hrs after addition of translation inhibitors for western blot. To test effectiveness of translation inhibitors, control macrophages were treated with decreasing concentrations of cycloheximide and anisomycin for 30mins. Cells were pulsed with [ 35 S]-cysteine-methionine for 2hrs and lysates were run on SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Figure S1 . Atg5 was required for the control of MNV by IFN\u03b3 in vivo and in vitro, related to Figure 1 . (A-E) Tissue viral burden in mice 5 days after inoculation with 3 x 10 4 pfu of MNVlung (A), liver (B), spleen (C), mesenteric lymph node (MLN, D), distal ileum (DI, E), and brain (E). Atg5-deficient mice were compared to control mice. * (p<0.05), ** (p<0.01), *** (p<0.001).

After inoculation of MNV (MOI=5), drugs were added again. At 12 hpi, total cellular proteins were harvested and subjected to western blot. Actin was detected as loading control. Atg7 deficient MEF (Atg7 KO MEF) cell lysate was used as an autophagy-deficient control. Identification of amino acids in Atg5 critical for its binding to Atg16L1. Mouse Atg5 wild-type and mutants were cloned into a FLAG-tagging plasmid and mouse Atg16L1 was cloned into a V5tagging plasmid using the GATEWAY cloning system (Invitrogen). At 48 hrs post-transfection of 293T cells with V5-mAtg16L1 and FLAG-mAtg5 mutant as indicated, the transfected cells were lysed and subject to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody. Total immune-complexes were then subject to western blot (N=2) detecting FLAG (immunoprecipitated) and V5 (coimmunoprecipitated).

(C) Lack of a role for ROS in IFN\u03b3-mediated control of MNV replication. Macrophages were treated with 10 mM of NAC (N-ACETYL-L-CYSTEINE) for 12 hours before and during MNV infection (total 24 hours) and MNV replication was analyzed by flow cytometry (N=3). (D-F) Growth analysis of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV, D), murine hepatitis virus (MHV, E), and West Nile virus (WMV, F) in control and Atg5-deficient macrophages (N=2). Macrophages were untreated or pre-treated with the indicated dose of IFN\u03b3 for 12 hr before infection and then inoculated at low (0.05) MOI. At 24 hpi, virus titers were measured by plaque assay.
