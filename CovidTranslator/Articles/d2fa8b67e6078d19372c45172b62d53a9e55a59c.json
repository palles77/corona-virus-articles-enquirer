It is estimated that three-fourths of emerging diseases are zoonotic [1, 2] . Facing the invasion of so many unpredictable pathogens and the emergence of bioterrorism as a global threat, a fast and definite diagnosis has become more important to eradicate or control the spread of diseases. Among diagnostic tools, anatomic pathology is effective in recognizing or excluding infectious diseases based on morphological changes in organs in affected species [3] [4] [5] . Human and veterinary pathologists are familiar with their own fields. However, German physician Rudolph Virchow (1821-1902), a towering figure in 19 th medicine and pathology, stated, \"Between animal and human medicine, there is no dividing line-nor should there be\" while working on the zoonosis of trichinosis and hydatid disease [6, 7] . This emphasis based on diseases across species lines established the concept of \"one medicine\" and led to the development of comparative medicine and comparative pathology.",

Anatomic pathologists are capable of analyzing and interpreting anatomical or functional manifestations of diseases from autopsy, biopsy and cytology materials using routine processes and advanced diagnostic skills. They can provide important clues to the diagnostic team in characterization of diseases [3, 8, 9] . Years of experience have shown that data obtained from animal necropsies can be useful in determining the cause of death, which allows comparison with human counterpart diseases. Histopathological and cytopathological observations often allow for establishment of a definite diagnosis or exclusion of a wide variety of diseases. Compared with other diagnostic methods such as culture, immunodiagnosis and molecular biology, anatomic pathology is safe, economical, fast and reliable. It can help provide a disease diagnosis using formalin-fixed tissues, and direct visualization of lesions with fewer falsenegative results.",

To solve the complexities of emergence and re-emergence of zoonoses, effective and integrated collaboration between human and veterinary pathology is needed. With the use of morphologic features and auxiliary special techniques, anatomic pathologists contribute greatly to the diagnosis and consequent management of zoonoses (Table 4) . Retrospective case studies of recently occurring zoonoses reflect the importance of diagnostic pathology with its use of morphologic similarities in disease diagnosis. In 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in several countries and caused human deaths. The cause of the disease has been attributed to a coronavirus. Coronaviruses in animal species have been well known for years. In coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), multinucleated syncytial giant cells (Fig. 11) in lesions of the liver and colon share common features with one of the characteristic lesions of SARS (Fig. 12) [16, 17] . Further study indicated that intranasal infection of A/J mice with MHV strain 1 produced pulmonary pathologic features of SARS, including interstitial pneumonitis, dense macrophage infiltrates, giant cells, and hyaline membranes, resulting in death in all animals [17, 18] .",
