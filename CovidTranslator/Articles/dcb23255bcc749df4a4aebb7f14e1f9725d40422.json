Four questions were addressed: (i) how to build the whole population at the city level, (ii) how to build the structure of the activity bundles for the city, (iii) how to assign daily activity patterns to each individual, and (iv) how to simulate within-AB transmission. The model was calibrated and examples of simulation results such as dynamics of the population during a whole day, infection distribution and network analysis are presented.",

By 2020, 55% of the world's population is projected to live in urban areas (Leautier 2006) . Fortunately, the epidemiological environment can be improved by urbanization. For example, urbanization processes can create improved nutrition, housing less vulnerable to vermin and cleaner drinking water (Daily & Ehrlich 1996) . However, the large density of population living in urban areas increases the probability of intimate contact between people. Simulating the transmission of infectious disease transmission within urban areas is, thus, of great importance. As reviewed by Daily & Ehrlich (1996) , the urban area's 'amplification' effect in terms of infectious disease transmission was noted by Decock & Mccormick (1988) . The need to investigate the relationship between urbanization patterns, individuals' space-time dynamics and infectious disease transmission has led to an interest in the development of simulation models of both disease transmission and space-time behaviour at the individual level.",

The twentyfirst century has seen a revival of the application of IBMs for the simulation of infectious disease transmission (Eubank 2002; Halloran et al. 2002; Eichner 2003; Ferguson et al. 2003 Ferguson et al. , 2005 Ferguson et al. , 2006 Bian 2004; Carley et al. 2004; Dibble & Feldman 2004; Eubank et al. 2004; Longini et al. 2005) .

Yang & Atkinson (in press) discussed methods based on spatial adjacency and social relations and proposed an individual spacetime activity-based model (ISTAM) as a solution to simulate airborne infectious disease transmission among the human population based on individuals' space-time activities. These activity-based models are rooted in time geography, which provides a framework for describing and defining how individuals perform activities under the constraints of time and space (H\u00e4gerstrand 1970) . The concept of 'lifeline' represents the path taken by an individual in time-space, while 'bundle' describes the convergence of human activity in space-time (H\u00e4gerstrand 1970) . If lifelines of every individual in the population are known, bundles can be identified in which lifelines of multiple individuals interact. Then, it is possible to simulate the transmission of specific infectious diseases on the more detailed level of this bundle (Forer 2002) . In this paper, and another paper by Yang & Atkinson (in press) , the concept of activity bundle (AB) is borrowed from time geography and defined as a semantic space where contact probability varies as a function of the dynamics of humans inside the bundle.",

The subset of all locations, which an individual visits as a result of his/her daily activities, is defined as an activity space (Golledge & Stimson 1997) . As stated by Golledge & Stimson (1997) , the activity space of a typical individual is composed of three parts: (i) movements within and near the home; (ii) movements to and from regular activity locations, such as journeys to work, shop, socialize, and so on; and (iii) movements in and around the locations where these activities occur. Sch\u00f6nfelder & Axhausen (2002 described and discussed three methods for describing individual activity spaces: (i) confidence ellipses; (ii) kernel densities; and (iii) minimum spanning trees (networks). A similar concept of 'personal network for usual places' was presented by Flamm & Kaufmann (2006) to identify a certain number of daily life centres. A large amount of research has been undertaken on individuals' daily activities at the between-AB level, especially in the fields of transportation and urban planning. Both utility maximization (Bowman & Ben-Akiva 2001) and rule-based approaches (Pendyla & Kitamura 1998; Arentze & Timmermans 2007) have been used to describe how households and individuals determine their daily lifeline, including decisions about which activities to undertake, at what locations, at what times, with which persons and how to travel to those locations. These decisions are made subject to spatio-temporal constraints as defined by time geography (H\u00e4gerstrand 1970) . Activity-based models at this level have been applied widely in transportation (Miller et al. 2004; Batty 2005a,b; Ettema et al. 2006) . These models provide a starting point for modelling the presence of individuals in ABs, within which diseases are transmitted.",

One example is the pedestrian model proposed by colleagues (Batty 2003, 2005a,b; Batty et al. 2003) to study how behaviour emerges from aggregated interactions between fine-scale objects.

A number of individuals 'who occasionally meet at the same place where they intend to do the same thing constitute a series', while individuals in a group 'form a social entity which persists over a period of time and in which the individuals share a long-term purpose'. It is believed that role performance and social involvement are influenced by the spatial environment (Baldassare 1978) . Baldassare (1978) claimed that 'individuals must obtain varying degrees of physical separation or closeness to others in order to engage in their activities'. Similarly, Gatrell (1983) claimed that 'The spacing of individuals depends not only on how the environment has been designed but also on the task or nature of interaction that the individuals must perform'. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that there are social rules about how close humans can approach each other. For example, Hall (1966) identified four distances: intimate; personal; social; and public (table 1) .",

The student body provided an example that was relatively simple in terms of daily activity patterns, population structure and AB structure, and this simplicity facilitated modelling. However, a student population is clearly a special case compared with the general human community (e.g. the whole population within a city). To apply the ISTAM at the city level, four additional questions needed to be answered: (i) how to build the whole population in terms of the demographic, social and economic properties; (ii) how to build all ABs within a city in terms of their category, percentage and spatial distribution; (iii) how to assign daily activity patterns to each individual; and (iv) how to simulate individuals' activities at within-AB levels without detailed information about these ABs' physical conditions. This paper explores the above four questions and attempts to provide answers through the application of the ISTAM to the city of Eemnes in The Netherlands. The aim of the research was to apply the ISTAM at the city level to model a hypothetical influenza epidemic spreading among the population. Section 2 introduces the research methods, specifically the ISTAM and rolebased AB simulation. Background and data sources are introduced in \u00a73. Five sub-processes for building the population and city are presented in \u00a74. Section 5 describes the simulation of individuals' movements between ABs and interactions within ABs. Section 6 shows the results of the analysis and simulations, while \u00a7 \u00a77 and 8 provide a discussion and conclusion, respectively.",

At the within-AB level, interest is in capturing each individuals' space-time dynamics at fine space-time scales.

Furthermore, the raster or vector space can be two-or three-dimensional. Description of these two data models can be found in Yang & Atkinson (2006) . By raster or vector space AB simulation, individuals' spatial locations within an AB are modelled explicitly and both the first and second types of contact can be simulated directly and without discrimination. Under most circumstances, internal physical information about an AB is not available. Then, it is assumed that the behaviour of individuals in small areas is among other things determined by the roles that they play in a group, and the individuals' roles within their joint activity are the primary basis for the simulation of the contacts between individuals. Importantly, the spatial pattern of individuals (i.e. relative locations between individuals) is explicit, but individuals' absolute spatial locations are not explicit.

Role-based simulation had been proposed in a previous paper (Yang & Atkinson 2006) , but this paper represents the first real implementation of such role-based AB simulation within the ISTAM. The infection process between two individuals, as discussed before, can be separated into two stages: coming into contact and becoming infected. The probabilities of coming into contact ( p c ) and infection during one contact ( p i ) were used to express the random properties of these two processes. As discussed before, different distance rules can be applied to determine the distances between individuals who are involved in a variety of activities and play different roles. In the ISTAM, the square of the distance between individuals at a fine spatial scale is assumed to be inversely related to p i .

The customers can be divided further into several customer groups. Alternatively, to simplify the computation, the individuals could be divided into only two groups (i.e. workers and clients). Different types of contacts could occur between and within different groups. Different values of p c can be set for different types of contacts. For example, it can be assumed that all the customers belonging to the same customer group prefer to maintain personal distances or intimate distances between each other, while the waiters prefer to maintain a social distance with the customers when they are not providing service and a personal distance when they are providing service. Customers belonging to different customer groups prefer to maintain public distances to retain privacy, but in many circumstances this cannot be satisfied due to the restriction of the physical environment of the restaurant.",

This activity pattern included not only the average duration for every possible activity but also the probability of the time of commencement for certain activities. Three types of activities were dealt with as exceptions: study time (applicable to children, assuming all children go to school during school hours); working time (applicable to all adult workers, assuming all workers go to work during working hours); and sleeping time. These three types of time were assigned to the individuals as personal properties during the generation of the whole population. For the daily activity of one person of one week day, firstly, these three special types of activities were fixed. Then, from the beginning to the end of the time sequence, the vacant time units were assigned to activity types by the probability weights from the assigned activity pattern in relation to the sociodemographic segment. For spatial location, for every person, her/his household and work place (or school) were fixed from the beginning, and other locations (ABs) were selected randomly (or the spatially closest one was selected). At every time step, individuals can move between different locations. For both children between 11 and 18 years and adults, their activity patterns were assigned according to their properties in the four dimensions. After these processes, the whole population of this city was built and all types of AB were distributed to all PC6 zones.

It is clear that most households are within the boundary of the city centre; so in the following sections the spatial display is zoomed within the boundary of the city centre to highlight the area where most contacts between individuals could occur.

According to Cox & Subbarao (2000) , a characteristic pattern for localized epidemics within a community is that the epidemic begins abruptly, peaks within 14-21 days and ends within 35-70 days, and the overall attack rate is estimated to be 10-20%. At IZ0.03, the simulated SIR plot is shown in figure 6 . The simulated epidemic peaked at approximately 30 days and ended between 70 and 80 days, at which time 40% of the population had been infected. A possible reason for this mismatch is that, in reality, during the epidemic period, humans will change their behaviour according to their own or other people's health states, such as staying at home or going to a health care facility to rest and avoid infecting other people. In the future, the model can be refined (e.g. to include individuals' reactions to the epidemics) to reduce this mismatch.",

It is clear that infections in figure 8a concentrate within a relatively small number of PC6 zones compared with those in figure 8b , and there were no PC6 zones with more than 100 infections in figure 8b. The reason is that in reality, during the daytime, a large number of individuals stay within a relatively small number of ABs such as schools, industrial sites and farms so that a large number of infections occur there. Figure 9 shows how the number of individuals in the latent stage (i.e. infected but not infectious), the stage of being infectious without symptoms, the stage of infectious with symptoms and the total number of infected individuals change over time. The lag effect in time and the 'misplace' effect in space within the empirical epidemic data could be an interesting focus for research.

Another example is provided by Ferguson et al.

Here, the sum of all contacts between two individuals is taken as the value for the edge and the network is simplified to a static network corresponding to one specific period.

Also from table 9, we know that Space-time activity-based modelling Y. Yang et al. 769 most infections occurred within households and at school.

Even within a rather small city such as Eemnes, the demographic properties of the population, the physical condition of the landscape and the daily activity patterns of individuals can be very complicated. Inevitably, problems exist with the application of the ISTAM to Eemnes. Data collection was time consuming (e.g. the activity data survey took half a year to complete). Furthermore, because the data (table 4) were not collected for the purpose of this application, much data preparation was needed before the simulation. Owing to the shortage of practical data, certain human activities such as activities related to traffic and outdoor activities were neglected. In reality, human contact within transportation vehicles, especially public transportation, plays an important role in infectious disease transmission among the human population. Some ABs are outdoor, and in such cases weather conditions should not be neglected. To include a climate and weather module is a sensible choice, an example is the model of BioWar (Carley et al. 2004) . Eleven types of AB were simulated within the ISTAM for the above application, but some types of public AB, although very small in number, can play a crucial role. Examples are sports stadia and marketplaces. A large number of individuals aggregate together periodically (e.g. weekends during league match season) or aperiodically (e.g. celebrations during holidays). Within some types of AB such as shopping centres or main traffic stations, individuals are highly ",
