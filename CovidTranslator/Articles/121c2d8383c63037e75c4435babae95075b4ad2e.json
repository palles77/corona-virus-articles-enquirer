However, at present there is no agreed-on set of public health competencies that family physicians and other primary care practitioners should attain to better ensure they possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and conf\u0131dence to effectively face diverse public health situations-from common to emergent. Using an iterative consultative process, the authors developed a set of public health competencies relevant to family medicine and primary care.",

This symposium arose out of discussions at the pan-Canadian Public Health Human Resources Task Force concerning the role of primary care practitioners in Canada's public health workforce. The primary goals of the symposium were to identify: (1) the public health competencies that family medicine residents should possess at graduation; and (2) the primary care competencies that community medicine residents should possess at graduation. To help address these goals, a presymposium discussion document was prepared by reviewing existing documents to develop an initial competency draft using a \"multi-level competency model\" developed by the University of Toronto's Department of Family and Community Medicine. The resources accessed and reviewed to inform the preparation of the presymposium discussion document included: cation (ACGME) statement regarding the community medicine objectives required in family medicine residency programs 7 ; \u2022 the ACGME statement regarding the requirements for residency programs in public health and general preventive medicine. 8 A search of the literature, coupled with suggestions from individuals consulted, identif\u0131ed several other relevant and informative Canadian, 9, 10 American, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] British, 16 -18 and Australian 19 -21 publications. These were also reviewed and assisted the development of a draft set of public health competencies relevant to family medicine and primary care.",

Symposium discussions enabled the authors to further revise the discussion document and proposed set of competencies.

Apply evidence-informed practice strategies to improve patient population coverage for preventive services (e.g., routine questions, chart/computer reminders/prompts, patient invitations/recalls). D6. Describe the complementary roles of family medicine and public health in achieving the prevention and control of conditions of public health interest.E. Demonstrate an effective approach to public communication, collaboration, and advocacy E1.
