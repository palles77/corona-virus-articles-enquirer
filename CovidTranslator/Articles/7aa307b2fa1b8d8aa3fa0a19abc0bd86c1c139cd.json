            "text": "A cute respiratory tract infections (ARTI's) are a leading cause of infectious disease-related morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years of age worldwide, particularly in the developing countries. 1 The ARTI's can be caused by bacteria and fungi, but viral infections are the most common causes. In developing countries, viruses represent a considerable proportion of the pathogens associated with ARTI's, varying from 40-90% across studies. [2] [3] [4] The most frequently implicated viruses among children are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenoviruses (AdV), human rhinoviruses (hRV), and human enteroviruses (hEV). Several recently discovered viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and the human coronaviruses (hCoVs) (NL63 and OC43), have been identified as potential respiratory pathogens. In addition, 2 novel human polyomaviruses (Washington University virus [WU] and Karolinska Institute virus [KI]) have been detected in patients with respiratory infections. [5] [6] [7] Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI's) are the most severe forms of infection and cause of approximately 1.9 million annual deaths among children, 8 while upper respiratory tract infections (URTI's) are the most frequent presentation of respiratory infections. An estimated 50% of all illnesses in all age groups, and approximately 75% of illnesses in young children are viral URTI's. 9 Proper diagnosis of viral ARTI's has been shown to reduce the misuse of antibiotics and shorten the length of hospital stay. However, current challenges in detecting respiratory viruses include inconsistent clinical manifestations of viral RTI's and variable sensitivity and specificity of available diagnostic assays. The traditional diagnostic methods for the respiratory viruses including cell culture and direct immunofluorescence assays are time consuming and technically demanding. 10 Several types of molecular biological methods, including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), PCR-hybridization, and real time PCR, have been introduced as more rapid and sensitive detection methods for respiratory infections. 3, 5, [11] [12] [13] Most studies in Saudi Arabia focused on a small number of viral pathogens, and information on the relative contribution of each pathogen to clinical forms of ARTI's is incomplete. [14] [15] [16] Hence, the aims of our study were to investigate the distribution of 15 respiratory viruses in children with ARTI's using multiplex RT-PCR, and to evaluate the presenting clinical, demographic, and epidemiological features of these different viral infections.",

Our results confirm that RSV and hRV play a key role in RTI's in children; RSV was the most frequent respiratory virus detected, followed by hRV.

The detection rates for IVs and PIVs in our study were comparable with other studies, reporting rates of 0.8-12.6% for IV's and 2.8-19.4% for PIV's. 3, 5, 13, 19, 20, 23, 26 In our study, hCoVs were detected in 3.7% of all patients including 2 cases with bronchiolitis and 2 cases with pneumonia. In a previous Saudi study, 14 hCoVNL63 type was detected in 2.8% of 489 children. 14 However, in our study 2 hCoV types (hCoV NL63 and hCoV OC43) were reported. In September 2012, a novel human coronavirus, called the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first identified in samples obtained from a Saudi Arabian businessman who died from acute respiratory failure. 29 As of May 2013, a total of 49 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection with 26 deaths have been reported to the WHO, including 37 in Saudi Arabia with 21 deaths. 30 These figures highlight the characteristic distribution of hCoVs emerging types circulating in Saudi Arabia.",

The RSV, hRV and AdV were the most frequent pathogens, accounting for over than two-thirds of cases with ARTI's. However, other emerging viruses as hMPV, hCoV NL63 and hCoV OC43 seem to play an important role in pediatric LRTI's. Moreover, the use of multiplex RT-PCR is needed to provide not only epidemiological and virological data, but also the opportunity to understand the emergence of novel respiratory viral pathogens ahead of time.",
