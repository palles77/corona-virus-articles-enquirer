Consequently, viruses recruit host ribosomes to translate viral mRNAs, typically using virally encoded functions to seize control of cellular translation factors and the host signalling pathways that regulate their activity. This not only ensures that viral proteins will be produced, but also stifles innate host defences that are aimed at inhibiting the capacity of infected cells for protein synthesis. Remarkably, nearly every step of the translation process can be targeted by virally encoded functions. This Review discusses the diverse strategies that viruses use to subvert host protein synthesis functions and regulate mRNA translation in infected cells.",

No matter whether their genomes are RNA or DNA, and regardless of their mRNA production method, the goal remains the same: to ensure that cellular ribosomes are recruited to viral mRNAs. The ensuing synthesis of viral proteins is required for viral genome replication and progeny virion production. Typically, commandeering ribosomes to viral mRNAs involves subverting cellular translation factors and signalling pathways that control the host protein synthesis apparatus. Many discrete strategies have been uncovered by studying translation control in virus-infected cells. These investigations have not only revealed key steps in viral pathogenesis, but also defined paradigms for translation control in uninfected cells. In this Review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms by which viruses gain control over the cellular functions required for mRNA translation.",

            "text": "Prior to their recruitment to mRNAs, 40S ribosome subunits bind to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (eIF1), eIF1A, the eIF3 complex and eIF5, along with eIF2\u00b7GTP, to assemble a 43S pre-initiation complex loaded with the charged initiator-methionine tRNA (Met-tRNA i ). Unlike bacterial mRNAs, most eukaryotic mRNAs cannot position ribosomes on their 5\u2032 termini to initiate translation. Instead, eIFs recognize structural landmarks in the mRNA to load 40S subunits onto the transcript. The 7-methylguanosine cap (m 7 G) that distinguishes the 5\u2032 end of the eukaryotic mRNA is bound by eIF4F, a multisubunit complex comprising the capbinding protein eIF4E and the DEAD box-containing RNA helicase eIF4A, both bound to the large molecular scaffold eIF4G 1 . Cap recognition by eIF4E anchors the complex on the mRNA, and eIF4G binding enhances the affinity of eIF4E for the cap. Indeed, eIF4E binding to eIF4G represents a crucial step in which physiological inputs regulate eIF4F assembly and translation initiation. Integration of signals relating to nutrient availability and energy supply, as well as growth factor signals, by the kinase complex mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates the translation repressor eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1), which binds eIF4E and suppresses eIF4F assembly. Hyperphosphorylation of 4EBP1 by activated mTORC1 liberates eIF4E, allowing eIF4G to bind eIF4E and stimulate cap-dependent translation (FIG. 2) phosphorylated by an eIF4G-associated kinase (either MNK1 or MNK2). Whereas basal eIF4E phosphorylation requires MNK2, inducible p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase family-responsive and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-responsive eIF4E phosphorylation is MNK1 dependent. eIF4F assembly coordinates the interactions of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 mRNA ends, as a poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) recognizes the 3\u2032 terminus of the polyadenylated mRNA and associates with eIF4G to stimulate initiation. This interaction probably restricts recruitment of the 40S ribosome to mRNAs with intact 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini 1 . Thus, in eukaryotes, regulated assembly of a specialized ribonucleoprotein complex including eIF4F and PABP facilitates 40S subunit loading onto mRNA (FIG. 1) . This key initiation step is rate limiting, and the degree to which individual mRNAs are reliant on high or low eIF4F levels depends on the extent of secondary structure in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR). Although regulated eIF4F assembly marks the mRNA 5\u2032 end and controls 40S subunit recruitment, eIF4F does not directly tether ribosomes to mRNA. eIF3 bridges the eIF4F cap recognition complex and the 43S preinitiation complex 1 . After positioning the 40S subunit onto the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA, the AUG start codon is identified by a process termed scanning. By binding 40S subunits, eIF3 also prevents 60S subunits from joining during scanning and initiation.",

            "text": "Regulated eIF4F assembly is a fundamental step in controlling cap-dependent translation initiation in eukaryotes. Given the importance of protein synthesis in the biology of viruses, it is no wonder viruses target eIF4F to subvert and gain control of the host translational apparatus (FIG. 2) . Some viruses impair host translation by removing key structural elements in the mRNA, such as the m 7 G cap, by inactivating eIF4F subunits or by manipulating eIF4F-binding proteins, thus preventing synthesis of host defence molecules that antagonize viral The process of translation has three phases: initiation, elongation and termination. Each stage requires specific translation factors. a | Initiation. The 40S ribosome bound to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (eIF1), eIF1A, the eIF3 complex and eIF5 is loaded with initiatormethionine tRNA (Met-tRNA i ) in the P site by eIF2\u00b7GTP, forming a 43S pre-initiation complex. Subsequently, the 43S complex is positioned onto the 5\u2032 end of a capped (red circle), polyadenylated mRNA by eIF4F, a multisubunit complex composed of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A (abbreviated here as 4E, 4G and 4A). The polyadenylated 3\u2032 mRNA end is recognized by a poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which also associates with eIF4G bound to the 5\u2032 end. This results in a 'closed-loop' topology, linking 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 mRNA ends. One of the eIF4E kinases MNK1 and MNK2 binds eIF4G and phosphorylates eIF4E. The assembled 48S complex then scans the mRNA to locate the AUG start codon. After AUG recognition, facilitated by eIF3, eIF1 and 1A, 60S subunit joining triggers initiation factor release. b | Elongation. Each charged tRNA is delivered to the 80S ribosome A site by eEF1A\u00b7GTP. Following ribosome-catalysed peptide bond formation, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) catalyses 80S translocation, transferring the deacetylated tRNA to the E site, positioning the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site and re-exposing the A site. c | Termination. Eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) recognizes the stop codon in the A site, triggering 80S arrest and polypeptide release. eRF3 releases eRF1 from the ribosome, and several initiation factors, together with ABCE1-directed nucleotide hydrolysis, dismantle the complex, thus recycling ribosome subunits. Figure 2 | Control of cap-dependent translation by regulated assembly of a multisubunit initiation factor. By binding to the cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E; abbreviated here to 4E), eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) represses translation and prevents assembly of the multisubunit initiation factor eIF4F (composed of eIF4E, eIF4A (labelled 4A) and eIF4G (labelled 4G)). The GTPase-activating protein TSC (composed of subunits hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2)) represses mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) by promoting RHEB\u00b7GDP accumulation. Receptor tyrosine kinase signalling, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and hypoxia regulate TSC activity. Inhibiting TSC allows RHEB\u00b7GTP accumulation and mTORC1 activation, and results in p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70 S6K) and 4EBP1 phosphorylation. 4EBP1 hyperphosphorylation relieves translational repression and releases eIF4E, allowing eIF4E to bind eIF4G and assemble eIF4F on 7-methylguanosine (m 7 G; red circle)-capped mRNA. eIF4F assembly typically results in eIF4E phosphorylation by the eIF4G-associated kinases (the MNK proteins) and recruits the 43S complex (see FIG. 1a) containing the 40S ribosome. A poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is depicted bound to the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, and this PABP associates with eIF4G to stimulate translation. In addition to stimulating ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) phosphorylation, p70 S6K activation by mTORC1 stimulates the eIF4A accessory factor eIF4B and inhibits eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, thereby stimulating elongation. Importantly, by repressing phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, p70 S6K activation prevents constitutive mTORC1 activation. Viral strategies for activating (green) and inhibiting (yellow) eIF4F are indicated; see main text for details and abbreviations.",

Translation of most host mRNAs via a cap-dependent mechanism allows viruses to impair cellular protein synthesis by altering the recognition of host mRNAs by eIF4F. For example, pox viral decapping enzymes remove the m 7 G cap 4,5 , whereas influenza viruses and hantaviruses 'steal' caps together with a 5\u2032-proximal 10-18-nucleotide host mRNA segment that is used to prime viral mRNA synthesis [6] [7] [8] . Despite this removal of eIF4F-binding determinants on host mRNAs, eIF4F components can still be recruited to viral transcripts. For instance, influenza virus RNA polymerase and NS1 interact with eIF4G to recruit eIF4F to viral mRNAs 9 . Other viral genomes contain genes encoding cap substitutes. The 5\u2032 ends of mRNAs from mammalian caliciviruses (such as noroviruses and plant potyviruses) are not capped but, instead, are covalently linked to a viral protein, VPg, that binds host initiation factors to recruit ribosomes [10] [11] [12] . The 5\u2032 mRNA leader of potyviruses, which are related to picornaviruses, contains eIF4G-binding pseudoknots that direct cap-independent translation 13 . Other plant viruses contain 3\u2032 cap-independent translational elements (CITEs), which interact with the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA and bind initiation factors, including eIF4E and eIF4G, to recruit ribosomes 14 . For example, the turnip crinkle virus (TCV) CITE contains tRNA-like structures that bind the 60S ribosome 15 . 3\u2032 CITES also suppress mRNA translation on positive-strand RNAs to promote genome replication 14 . Finally, hantavirus N protein reportedly has cap-binding, RNA-binding, helicase and ribosome-binding activities, substituting for eIF4F to promote translation of viral mRNAs 16 .",

Thus, replication of interferon-sensitive RNA viruses is suppressed in cells that are deficient in both 4EBP1 and 4EBP2 26 .

ICP6 is multifunctional and is also a subunit of the viral ribonucleotide reductase. When associated with eIF4G, however, ICP6 stimulates eIF4E binding to eIF4G and drives eIF4F assembly. Strikingly, in cells infected with an ICP6-deficient virus, eIF4E is released from the repressor 4EBP1 but increased eIF4F assembly is not observed 53 . This identified a new step controlling eIF4F formation, in addition to 4EBP1 hyperphosphorylation, that may be required under stressful conditions such as viral infection. Indeed, ICP6 contains a segment related to small heat shock proteins that can remodel translation factor complexes 54 . Although eIF4E binding to eIF4G is stimulated in HSV-1-infected cells, PABP binding to eIF4F is unchanged or reduced 37,55 , depending on cell type.

These sites can confer a potent competitive advantage to viral mRNAs, freeing them from host regulatory constraints and, in cases for which viral infection impairs cap-dependent translation, sustaining viral protein synthesis. Type I (for example, poliovirus) and II (for example, encephalomyocarditis virus) IRESs were first identified in picornaviruses. These two IRES types interact with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G; labelled 4G) carboxy-terminal domain 18 , which binds to eIF4A (labelled 4A) and eIF3. They require eIF5B, eIF2 and initiator-methionine tRNA (Met-tRNA i ), and are stimulated by the activity of eIF1, eIF1A and eIF4B. They also require IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs), which are RNA-binding proteins that alter IRES conformation and can promote eIF4G binding. Notably, the hepatitis A virus IRES is unusual in that it requires intact eIF4F with the cap-binding slot of eIF4E unoccupied, suggesting that eIF4E interacts with the viral mRNA or induces the conformational changes in eIF4G that are necessary for IRES binding. Type III IRESs, typified by those of hepatitis C virus and the pestiviruses, bypass requirements for eIF4F altogether by interacting with both eIF3 and the 40S ribosome 71 , analogous to ribosome recruitment through Shine-Dalgarno sequences in bacteria. These IRESs also require eIF5B, eIF2 and Met-tRNA i , although the requirement for these factors may be reduced in some cases (see main text). Finally, type IV IRESs of the family Dicistroviridae completely obviate the need for canonical initiation factors 67, 68 . Remarkably, these IRESs interact with the 40S subunit directly, inducing conformational changes and facilitating 60S subunit joining to form 80S ribosomes independently of initiation factors. In addition, a CCU sequence is positioned in the ribosomal P site while the A site is occupied by a CGU (encoding alanine).

How this is achieved and its contribution to viral replication remain unknown. Nevertheless, raising the concentration of eIF4F subunits may potentiate complex assembly. Instead of increasing host initiation factor levels, mimiviruses -large (2 Mb) DNA viruses that infect Acanthamoeba spp. -are the only viruses known to encode putative translation factors, one of which is eIF4E 57 .

In fact, viruses that rely on cap-independent translation to circumvent eIF4F often target eIF3 and ribosomal proteins. eIF3 is an adaptor that orchestrates how ribosomes, eIF4F and mRNA communicate, and is composed of 13 subunits (eIF3a-eIF3m) that interact (via eIF3e) with eIF4G, bind mRNA and contact the 40S ribosome. eIF3j is intimately involved with ribosome function and occupies the ribosomal decoding centre to facilitate scanning and AUG selection with eIF1A 1,69 . Some viruses directly recruit eIF3 to viral mRNAs through cis-acting RNA elements or interactions with viral proteins that partially mimic eIF4F (FIG. 2; TABLE 1 ). eIF3 also functions in re-initiation following termination of uORF translation in polycistronic mRNAs 70 .

Importantly, the process of ternary-complex formation and 40S loading is targeted by an innate host response designed to globally inhibit protein synthesis in virus-infected cells. eIF2 is a heterotrimeric guaninenucleotide-binding (G) protein composed of a regulatory \u03b1-subunit, a tRNA-binding \u03b2-subunit and a GTP-binding \u03b3-subunit. Following eIF2\u00b7GDP release on AUG recognition and 60S subunit joining, GDP is exchanged for GTP by eIF2B to recycle active eIF2\u00b7GTP for another initiation round. eIF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation of its \u03b1-subunit on Ser51 by any of four cellular kinases, each of which is activated by a discrete stress. GCN2 (also known as eIF2\u03b1K4) responds to amino acid starvation or ultraviolet light, haem deprivation activates HRI (also known as eIF2\u03b1K1), exceeding the protein-folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum triggers PERK (also known as eIF2\u03b1K3) and double-stranded (ds) RNA produced in virus-infected cells activates PKR (also known as eIF2\u03b1K2). Phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 has a greater affinity than its unphosphorylated counterpart for eIF2B and inhibits eIF2B guanine nucleotide exchange activity, thus depleting eIF2\u00b7GTP pools and inhibiting initiation 81 . Because eIF2B is present in limiting quantities, small changes in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation have large effects on protein synthesis. Although activation of any eIF2 kinase in virus-infected cells could inhibit protein synthesis and potentially result in autophagy 82 , type I interferon production by virus-infected cells stimulates PKR accumulation in neighbouring cells. PKR activation following infection of interferon-primed neighbouring cells globally inhibits protein synthesis and curtails viral spread, making this activation a key player in the innate response to viruses 1, 81 . However, host efforts to inactivate eIF2 by phosphorylation in order to limit viral replication are matched by viral countermeasures to inhibit interferon production and therefore indirectly prevent PKR accumulation, to directly preserve eIF2 activity for viral protein production or to bypass eIF2 function entirely (FIG. 3) .",

To directly target PKR, viruses encode dsRNA decoys that bind, but do not activate, PKR (such as the adenoviral VA RNA and the EBV EBERs), and PKR pseudosubstrates that divert activity from eIF2 (REF. 81 ). Other strategies include viral dsRNA-binding proteins that mask dsRNA and/or interact with and inhibit PKR (FIG. 3; TABLE 1) , and phosphatase-regulatory sub units that bind cellular catalytic subunits to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 (such as African swine fever virus (ASFV) DP71L 83 and HSV \u03b334.5 (also known as ICP34.5) 84 ). By targeting phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, phosphatases can antagonize any eIF2\u03b1 kinase. Often, viruses harness multiple strategies to prevent eIF2 phosphorylation, combining eIF2\u03b1-kinase-specific antagonists with a second function that broadly prevents phosphorylated-eIF2\u03b1 accumulation. For example, HSV-1 US11 binds dsRNA and PKR to inhibit the kinase while the HSV-1-encoded eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase subunit, \u03b334.5, removes phosphate that reaches eIF2\u03b1 85 . As a third method, HSV-1 glycoprotein B (gB) counteracts another eIF2\u03b1 kinase, PERK, preventing endoplasmic reticulum-stress-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation 86 . Similarly, VacV encodes both a dsRNA-binding PKR inhibitor (E3L) and a PKR and PERK pseudosubstrate (K3L) 87 . Although the eIF2\u03b1 kinase GCN2 has antiviral effects 88 , GCN2-specific antagonists have not been reported. Finally, the protein kinase-inhibiting molecular chaperone P58 IPK (also known as DNAJ3K) limits eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in influenza virus-, TMV-and tobacco etch virus-infected cells, illustrating the fact that viruses conscript host factors to prevent eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation 89, 90 .",

HCV 91 , Sindbis virus 92 , pestiviruses 93 , reoviruses 94 (including rotaviruses 95 ), Semliki Forest virus (SFV) 96 , poliovirus 97 and CrPV 98 induce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Although eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is not strictly required by rotaviruses or SFV, it helps to inhibit host translation. How viral mRNAs are translated without eIF2 or in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2 is beginning to emerge. Surprisingly, the CrPV IRES initiates translation without eIFs or Met-tRNA i and only requires an 80S ribosome and eEFs 67, 68 . Sindbis virus late mRNAs are also insensitive to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation 92 , whereas CSFV employs both eIF2-dependent and eIF2-independent translation modes 18, 99 . Finally, PKR-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation blocks interferon-induced protein production in HCV-infected cells 91 . Paradoxically, HCV proteins E2 and NS5A, as well as the HCV IRES, inhibit PKR and, in the case of E2, PERK 81 . Perhaps the HCV IRES is eIF2 independent in the physiological, infected-cell system. Indeed, high magnesium concentrations support HCV IRES function without eIF2 in vitro 100 . Alternatively, the HCV IRES could require eIF2, provided that HCV prevents eIF2 phosphorylation in local replication compartments on intracellular membranes but allows activated PKR to phosphorylate eIF2 in the cytoplasm. Cellular factors -including ligatin (also known as the GTPindependent initiation factor eIF2D 101 ) and MCT1 (also known as MCTS1)-DENR (also known as DRP) 73 that are capable of recruiting Met-tRNA i to 40S subunits and positioning the AUG start codon directly into the P site may explain the eIF2-independent initiation mechanisms used by HCV and Sindbis virus IRESs.",

Thus, viruses that activate mTORC1 to promote initiation also stimulate p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70 S6K) proteins, which phosphorylates and inhibits eEF2 kinase (FIGS 1,4). As eEF2 phosphorylation by eEF2 kinase inhibits elongation, p70 S6K stimulates elongation. By contrast, eEF2 kinase is stimulated by protein kinase A (PKA), Ca 2+ -calmodulin or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thus reducing elongation 2 . Viruses can alter eEF function and subcellular distribution. Similarly, viral manipulation of termination factors can regulate polyprotein synthesis or couple termination to re-initiation.",

Although these probably contribute to host shut-off, how viral mRNA translation proceeds without intact eIF5B or functional eEFs remains unknown.

Similarly, eEF2 is recruited to cytoplasmic viral replication compartments in cells infected with Sindbis virus 60 or ASFV 41 . Finally, the eEF1B\u03b1 subunit (formerly known as eEF1\u03b4), which mediates GDP-GTP exchange on eEF1A, is hyperphosphorylated by a conserved herpesvirus kinase 106 , although how this affects translational control in infected cells is unknown.",

Termination and re-initiation may be linked through the interaction of PABP with ribosome-bound eRF3 and cap-bound eIF4F 32, 107 . Polycistronic mRNAs of RNA viruses, for example, employ coupled termination-re-initiation events to translate downstream ORFs, similarly to bacteriophage translational coupling (BOX 2) . Murine norovirus VP2 is synthesized by such coupling 108 . Inactive eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2; with \u03b1-, \u03b2-and \u03b3-subunits depicted) bound to GDP (eIF2\u00b7GDP) is recycled to the active GTP-bound form by the five-subunit guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Once recycled, eIF2\u00b7GTP forms a ternary complex with initiator-methionine tRNA (Met-tRNA i ) and is loaded onto the 40S ribosome (see FIG. 1) . A 43S pre-initiation complex assembles after the ternary complex loads Met-tRNA i into the ribosomal P site, and this converts to a 48S complex on recruitment to eIF4F-and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP)-bound mRNA. Following identification of the AUG start codon by scanning, the GTPase-activating protein eIF5 stimulates GTP hydrolysis, and 60S subunit joining triggers the release of eIF2\u00b7GDP and inorganic phosphate (P i ). The resulting 80S ribosome carries out the elongation phase (FIG. 1) . Phosphorylation of eIF2 on its \u03b1-subunit by one of four different cellular eIF2\u03b1 kinases (see main text for details), each of which is activated by a discrete stress, prevents eIF2 recycling. Phosphorylated eIF2 binds tightly to and inhibits eIF2B, blocking translation initiation. The host protein phosphatase 1 catalytic (PP1c) subunits can dephosphorylate eIF2 when partnered with either an inducible (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34)) or constitutively active (CReP; also known as PPP1R15B ) regulatory component. Viral strategies for inhibiting eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (yellow), activating eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation (green) or bypassing a requirement for eIF2 (green) are indicated.

Retroviral reverse transcriptase binds eRF1 to modulate termination and re-initiation 111 , and re-initiation protects HIV-1 mRNAs from nonsense-mediated decay 112 . Finally, termination in small uORFs can have a regulatory role by restricting scanning ribosomes from re-initiating at downstream cistrons. A variation of this strategy operates in HCMV-infected cells, in which ribosomal stalling (which is dependent on the sequence of the uORF2 peptide) prevents scanning ribosomes from reaching the downstream UL4 ORF. By binding eRF1, uORF2 peptide inhibits translation at its own stop codon. Ultimately, the stalled ribosome disengages the mRNA 113 .",

Although most translational control strategies operate at the rate-limiting initiation step, different regulatory mechanisms target elongation and termination. Translation elongation begins after eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B)-mediated 60S subunit joining triggers eIF release, and the assembled 80S ribosome begins polypeptide chain extension. Each new aminoacylated tRNA is delivered to the A site by eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) bound to GTP. Following GTP hydrolysis, eEF1A\u00b7GDP is released, unable to bind aminoacylated tRNA until it is recycled to the active GTP-bound form by the multisubunit eEF1B guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Both eEF1A and eEF1B can be phosphorylated by cellular kinases, including CK2 and protein kinase C, which stimulate their activity. Ribosome-catalysed peptide bond formation precedes eEF2-mediated translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA into the P site and the de-acylated tRNA into the E site, exposing the unoccupied A site for successive rounds of elongation that form the polypeptide chain. eEF2\u00b7GDP exits the ribosome and is recycled to the active, GTP-bound form without the assistance of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, owing to the high intrinsic GDP release rate. Phosphorylation by eEF2 kinase inhibits eEF2 activity. eEF2 kinase itself is phosphorylated and inhibited by p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70 S6K) proteins following mTOR complex 1 activation. By contrast, eEF2 kinase is activated by protein kinase A (PKA), Ca 2+ -calmodulin and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 2 .

Although other, related herpesviruses (HCMV, KSHV and EBV) do not inhibit splicing, they all encode an ICP27-like protein that promotes nuclear export of viral mRNA. The HCMV protein UL69, which associates with PABP and eIF4A, is required to suppress eIF4E binding to 4EBP1 (REF. 114 ), suggesting that viral nuclear-export proteins associate with initiation factors to stimulate viral mRNA translation. In KSHV-infected cells, ORF57 protein facilitates export of intronless viral mRNA and associates with PYM, a cellular factor that stimulates recruitment of the ribosomal pre-initiation complex to newly exported mRNAs 115 . Other viruses that replicate in the nucleus, such as adenoviruses or influenza viruses, also inhibit host mRNA export 116, 117 . Consequently, the adenovirus proteins E1B 55K and E4 ORF6 stimulate selective, nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1; also known as TAP)-dependent nuclear export of viral late mRNAs. How influenza virus mRNAs reach cytoplasmic ribosomes remains unknown, although the TAP nuclear export pathway is required 118 .

            "text": "Small, non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate the stability and translation of both host and viral mRNAs via RNA interference (RNAi). After processing from a larger, primary transcript, a 22-nucleotide miRNA is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Perfect base pairing with target sequences commonly found in the 3\u2032 UTR triggers mRNA degradation, whereas imperfect base pairing inhibits translation 129 . Although RNAi is a potent host antiviral defence mechanism in plants and invertebrates, virally encoded functions can antagonize the host miRNA machinery. Whether miRNAs contribute to mammalian innate antiviral responses remains less clear. However, herpesviruses in particular do express virally encoded miRNAs On recognition of a stop codon in the A site, eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) triggers 80S arrest and polypeptide release. eRF3 subsequently releases eRF1 from the ribosome, and the 80S ribosome is dismantled into 40S and 60S subunits (see FIG. 1 ). Virally encoded functions that regulate termination are indicated. Notably, HIV reverse transcriptase and the termination upstream ribosomal-binding site (TURBS) RNA cis-elements in influenza B virus and feline calicivirus (FCV) allow eukaryotic ribosomes to efficiently re-initiate translation, a property normally associated with prokaryotic ribosomes. eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; uORF2, upstream ORF 2. in latently infected cells, and these miRNAs are thought to suppress expression of lytic genes and help maintain latency. They also suppress host apoptotic and immune responses. Another DNA virus-encoded miRNA reduces translation of the SV40 large T antigen mRNA to limit the host immune response 129 . Poxviruses and most RNA viruses have not been reported to encode miRNAs. This may reflect their cytoplasmic replication, which could restrict access to nuclear miRNA-processing steps, or, for some RNA viruses, may reflect the potentially detrimental effects of miRNA processing on viral genome integrity. RNA viruses can, however, use miRNA-based strategies to manipulate the host translation machinery. Induction of a host transcription factor in enterovirusinfected cells promotes miR-141 expression, which impairs translation of eIF4E-encoding mRNA and inhibits cap-dependent protein synthesis 130 . The HCV RNA genome 5\u2032 UTR contains two tandemly repeated, liver-specific miR-122 targets. Surprisingly, miR-122 enhances, rather than suppresses, both genome abundance 131 and viral mRNA translation 132, 133 , possibly through effects on the conformation of the HCV IRES. These target sites destabilize reporter mRNAs when placed in the 3\u2032 UTR, suggesting that the functional outcome of miRNAs on their targets is influenced by the position of their recognition sites 134 . Finally, HCMV reduces the expression of host miRNAs that suppress ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTORC signalling 129 . Indeed, much remains to be learned about miRNA targets and their contribution to infection.",

            "text": "The effectiveness with which viruses co-opt components of the host translation machinery represents an extraordinary example of parasitism and illustrates the importance of this process to viral replication. Nature validates this view, as initiation factors determine plant susceptibility to RNA viruses. Most recessive resistance genes from crop species encode eIF4E and eIF4G family members 135 , and host antiviral factors such as pokeweed antiviral protein bind eIF4G and depurinate viral RNA 136 . Virus-host interactions that regulate protein synthesis in infected cells could potentially lead to novel broad-spectrum antiviral targets that are ripe for development. Even antagonizing a general factor such as eIF4F may be tolerated for limited periods to combat acute, life-threatening infections, as high eIF4F activity seems to be reserved for translating complex, growth-related mRNAs. 4EGi-1, a synthetic inhibitor that affects eIF4F and ribosome binding, has potent, non-cytotoxic antiviral properties against HSV-1 and VacV 42 ; screens using small interfering RNAs suggest initiation factors and ribosomal proteins as potential antiviral targets 137, 138 ; and compounds that inhibit eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation reduce HSV-1 replication 139 . Furthermore, a small-molecule inhibitor of the MNK proteins reduces replication of VacV 38 , ASFV 41 and several herpesviruses in culture 35, 37 . The MNK proteins are interesting targets, as they are not essential, core initiation factors but instead have a regulatory role. Other targets, such as inhibitors of the mTOR active site (which disrupt eIF4F and impair herpesviral replication 43 ), will probably have immunosuppressive side effects in vivo 140 . However, inhibiting a virally encoded mTOR activator, such as the HSV-1 kinase US3 (REF. 44 ), could prevent mTORC1 activation selectively in infected cells and circumvent this problem. IRESs, which are relied on by many RNA viruses, also represent potential targets [141] [142] [143] . Finally, virus-host interactions that regulate translation have contributed to the development of oncolytic viruses 144 .",

From mRNA availability for cytoplasmic ribosomes, to cell-signalling pathways that regulate translation factor abundance, localization and activity, to ribosome recruitment, all are commandeered to stimulate and sustain viral mRNA translation. The diversity of strategies used by different viruses reflects the varied viral life cycles, the specialized host cells that viruses infect and the methods of translation control in their cellular hosts (which are probably the main evolutionary drivers behind the diverse strategies used for subversion). Similarities between the translation control strategies that are operative in infected cells and in stress-induced, uninfected cells have emerged. Adenovirus-infected and uninfected, heat-stressed cells use ribosome shunting. Related viral and cellular regulatory phosphatase subunits are required to prevent accumulation of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 in HSVinfected cells and in uninfected cells recovering from endoplasmic reticulum stress. eIF4G can be cleaved by virally encoded proteases and also by cellular caspases during apoptosis. Key integrators such as TSC and mTORC proteins, which enable rapid control of cap-dependent translation in response to physiological cues in uninfected cells, have important roles stimulating or repressing translation in virus-infected cells. IRESs were originally discovered as viral genetic elements, but they enable translation of cellular mRNAs when eIF4F-mediated, cap-dependent translation is impaired by stress. By conferring eIF2 independence, newly identified factors such as ligatin could expand the range of conditions that support viral mRNA translation. Roles for specific (that is, RPS25) or modified ribosomal proteins may emerge for different viral and cellular IRESs. Finally, IRESs with minimal initiation factor requirements (such as those of HCV and CrPV) highlight how viral models provide powerful cellbiological and genetic tools that continue to expose surprising translation regulatory mechanisms.",
