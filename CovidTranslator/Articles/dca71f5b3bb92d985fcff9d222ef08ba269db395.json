Such policies should address ethical, legal and social concerns, and are as important to the scientific and commercial development of the field as the science itself. On occasion, policy issues take precedence over science, particularly when impasses are encountered or when public health or money is at stake. Here we discuss the spectrum of current issues and debates in genome policy, and how to actively engage all affected stakeholders to promote effective policy making.",

Many policy issues have arisen in response to genetic advances and applications, but the broader scale of genome sciences expands and potentially exacerbates them, and gives rise to new issues.

In particular, scientists should be made aware of policy issues, the various approaches that are used to address them, and effective methods to communicate scientific data to non-expert audiences. Other stakeholders, such as disease advocacy groups, have recognized the importance of understanding political processes, educating their members and providing opportunities to engage with policy makers 68 . In turn, policy makers must understand the scientific process in order to assess scientific evidence in areas such as appropriations, environmental policy and biodefense. We acknowledge, Box 5 | Direct to consumer marketing: caveat emptor Direct to consumer (DTC) marketing of genetic and genomic applications is an increasingly popular commercial strategy. Products ranging from ancestry testing to medical testing to genetically tailored cosmetics and diets are available for purchase, priced from US$50 to more than $1000. For some tests, approval by a health professional is not required -tests can be ordered by and results returned directly to the consumer. Although DTC marketing strategies can raise awareness and perhaps encourage consumers to discuss the appropriateness of tests with physicians, they could mislead vulnerable individuals 90 . As a result, education becomes vitally important to ensure that consumers are equipped with the knowledge to understand the benefits, risks and limitations of testing.",

In Iceland, a brief public consultation was conducted through radio and television programs, town hall meetings and public surveys. By contrast, the United Kingdom embarked on an ambitious 3-year public-consultation campaign through town hall meetings, focus groups, interactive workshops, key informant interviews and calls for comments on draft reports. Although the exchange of information helped to inform policy making, it also sought to raise public awareness about these projects. However, the distinction between a public-relations campaign and a public-consultation or education initiative is an important one to make, as public relations veiled as public consultation can lead to skepticism and mistrust 73 .",

The regular exchange of information between stakeholders and policy makers will hopefully lead to policies that are well informed and have a basis in sound scientific data.
