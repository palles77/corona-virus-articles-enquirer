The factors promoting zoonotic disease outbreaks in humans, apart from frequent contact with animals, include intensive livestock production, poor animal and personal hygiene, and overlap with wildlife habitat. A common way for vector-borne diseases to spread is through the bite of a mosquito or tick.

At the international level, strong cooperation among the WHO, OIE, and FAO is improving the efficiency of surveillance, including data collection, risk assessment, and risk management options, allowing for consistent, sciencebased risk communication on global health threats at the human-animal-ecosystem interface. A strategic agreement outlines the sharing of responsibilities and enhanced coordination of complementary roles and activities between the FAO, OIE, and WHO at national, regional, and global levels. Internally, cooperation takes place across departments, clusters, and regions of the aforementioned organizations. Externally, further cooperation materializes with links and contacts to additional international partners, such as international agencies and networks, NGOs, and academia, and to national agencies, such as institutions and administrative governmental units.",

Table 5 Biological hazards responsible for most important foodborne illnesses and related foods Campylobacter (poultry) E. coli O157:H7 (ground beef, leafy greens, and raw milk) Listeria (deli meats, unpasteurized soft cheeses, and produce) Salmonella (eggs, poultry, meat, and produce) Vibrio (raw oysters) Norovirus in many foods (e.g., sandwiches and salads) Toxoplasma (meats) For the EU, the One Health movement has in many senses grown out of the response to influenza-related crises. The definition of One Health chosen by the European Commission in its external relations and actions reads as follows: the One Health approach consists of (i) improving health and wellbeing through the prevention of risks and the mitigation of the effects of crises that originate at the interface between humans, animals and their various environments; (ii) for that purpose: (a) promoting a multi (cross) sectoral and collaborative approach; and (b) promoting a 'whole of society' approach to health hazards, as a systemic change of perspective in the management of risk.",

A cultural change putting emphasis on the prevention and appreciation of the importance of the connection, in terms of health and well-being, between humans, animals, and ecosystems, is required. Combating zoonotic diseases is not how to clean up the disease mess after the fact, but on how to prevent the mess from occurring in the first place. It would almost appear that the ideological lenses through which diseases in general are being studied preclude acting on the evidence. This, if nothing else, should raise a warning flag that those who study disease are not necessarily well equipped to promote health.",
