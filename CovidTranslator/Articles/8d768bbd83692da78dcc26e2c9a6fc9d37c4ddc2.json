Higher cortical brain centers will stimulate a catecholamine surge before the actual activity begins. This surge of neural hormones (epinephrine and norepinephrine) acts on the heart. By causing the sinoatrial node to depolarize more rapidly, the impulse for heart muscle contraction will become more frequent. In the highly trained athlete, heart rate may go from a low of 30 to 35 beats per minute to more than 200 beats per minute via catecholamine mediation. This increase in heart rate (and contractile force of the heart) is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, which signals for the pumping of catecholamines. 20 Whereas sympathetic discharge is increased, there is an inhibition of parasympathetic discharge. The heart begins to free itself of parasympathetic restraints and prepares itself for higher performance.",

Whether or not there is a true anticipatory phase in a particular situation, as the exercise phase is undertaken a steady state in cardiac output soon develops. There may be small variations and adjustments in preload, afterload, and mean arterial pressure. For a relatively fixed exercise task, a very efficient interplay of peripheral variables appears to adjust delivery of blood to the left ventricle. Stroke volume is not fixed but will vary to accommodate for changes in heart rate. With a slight increase in heart rate or stroke volume, metabolic needs of mild exercise can be met.

Inadequate and slowed diastolic filling is the most important abnormal mechanism to obtain, especially when the subject has tachycardia (Fig. 6-3 ). These diastolic abnormalities may result from the characteristic disordered morphology of myofibrils found on myocardial biopsy specimen. Called myofibrillar disarray, it is considered histologically characteristic of HCM. Of note, although evidence for a left ventricular outflow gradient may be absent in as many as half of subjects with HCM, diastolic abnormalities are common to all sufferers of HCM. It has been postulated that these diastolic abnormalities may further result from a disorder of Have you ever become dizzy or passed out during or after exercise? Have you ever had chest pain during or after exercise? Do you get tired more quickly than your friends do during or after exercise? Have you ever had racing of your heart or skipped beats? Have you had high blood pressure or high cholesterol? Have you ever been told you have a heart murmur? Has any family member or relative died of heart problems or sudden death before the age of 50? Have you had a severe viral infection such as mononucleosis within the last month? Has a physician ever denied or restricted your participation in sports for any heart problems? Have any of your relatives ever had any of the following conditions? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Dilated cardiomyopathy Marfan's syndrome Long QT syndrome Significant heart arrhythmia calcium metabolism in the myocardial cells of the left ventricle and sometimes the right ventricle. Small coronary vessel and conduction abnormalities may contribute to symptom generation in HCM. DNA testing is increasingly being used with some success in screening of subjects suspected of having HCM. Unfortunately, we are learning that HCMs are a whole spectrum of diseases with multiple genetic determinants. There are those who believe that certain other types of testing, such as electrophysiologic testing, may be able to stratify those with HCM according to risk. We someday may be able to screen and prescribe with greater confidence. The more widely followed approach prohibits participation in most competitive sports for those who carry the diagnosis of HCM.",

With these methods, we can readily determine whether there is a dynamic intraventricular or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in the subject being screened. Doppler echocardiography also is useful in noninvasively determining cardiac output in varying loading conditions during exercise. With this testing modality we can detect and evaluate intracardiac shunts and stenosis and regurgitation of any of the cardiac valves. Despite the powerful noninvasive techniques we now can use readily, sometimes more invasive techniques are the tests of last resort to be used in evaluating cardiac abnormalities in the athlete, from the \"semiinvasive\" modality called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to the clearly invasive cardiac catherization and electrophysiologic studies. With TEE, complex congenital abnormalities, aberrant coronary arteries, and cardiac and aortic trauma are evaluated. In catherization tests, coronary arteries and assessing conduction velocities in the heart clarify causes of supraventricular arrhythmias and heart block. Ventricular stimulation techniques attempt to induce potentially lethal sustained ventricular arrhythmias in a controlled setting. These tests appear to be useful in stratifying athletes with ventricular arrhythmias as high or low risk for life threatening cardiac events.",

Where the volume to be ejected by the heart increases (as in mitral regurgitation), the left ventricular chamber becomes enlarged with proportionately little wall thickening. As opposed to the pressure-loaded heart that has concentric hypertrophy, the volume-loaded heart with eccentric hypertrophy is associated with a high maximal oxygen uptake during exercise. If we consider the determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, we can understand how exercise can increase it. Heart rate, myocardial wall tension, and contractility are these determinants.

Attacks may be life threatening if the airway is involved. Prevention may be achieved with modification of exercise programs or with the use of antihistamines (diphenhydramine). In addition, selective H2-receptor blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham, Philadelphia, PA), ranitidine (Zantac, Glaxo Pharmaceuticals), famotidine (Pepcid, Merck & Co., West Point, PA), lansoprazole (Prevacid, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL), omeprazole (Prilosec, Astra Merck, Wayne, PA), and nizatidine (Axid, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN), have been used in the management of this condition.",

The use of bronchodilators will be helpful for those who have some evidence of reversible bronchospasm on PFTs. Cardiopulmonary testing is the best way to correlate the symptoms of COPD with objective evidence of limitations. Usually, to increase exercise endurance, exercise must be at least at 60% of VO 2 max, three times a week.",

It was reported by the World Health Organization to have been seen in 30 countries worldwide. The first outbreak centered in China and Hong Kong, although large outbreaks occurred in Toronto, Canada, and Singapore. In general, SARS begins with a high fever and other symptoms may include headache, an overall feeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also have mild respiratory symptoms at the outset. About 10% to 20% of patients have diarrhea. After 2 to 7 days, SARS patients may develop a dry cough. Most patients develop pneumonia. 3 SARS seems to spread by close person-to-person contact. It is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets. A recent study showed that SARS might be deadlier to patients born with a gene found in 10% to 15% of people of southern-Chinese ancestry. BMC Medical Genetics, an online biomedical-research journal, first published this. The gene is known as HLA B-46. Although initial research appeared to indicate a high fatality rate for this disease, it appears to be in line with influenza epidemics. Physicians should be suspect of sudden onset of dyspnea and high fevers in athletes flying to or from endemic areas. Treatment is symptomatic.",
