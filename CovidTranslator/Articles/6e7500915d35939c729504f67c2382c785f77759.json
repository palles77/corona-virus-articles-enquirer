Transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana expressing recombinant VP2 were developed. The VP2 gene of an IBDV antigenic variant E strain was isolated, amplified by RT-PCR and introduced into a plant expression vector, pE1857, having a strong promoter for plant expression. A resulting construct with a Bar gene cassette for bialaphos selection in plant (rpE-VP2) was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation. Agrobacterium containing the rpE-VP2 construct was used to transform Ar. thaliana and transgenic plants were selected using bialaphos. The presence of VP2 transgene in plants was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis and its expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. Western blot analysis and antigen-capture ELISA assay using monoclonal anti-VP2 were used to determine the expression of VP2 protein in transgenic plants. The level of VP2 protein in the leaf extracts of selected transgenic plants varied from 0.5% to 4.8% of the total soluble protein. Recombinant VP2 protein produced in plants induced antibody response against IBDV in orally-fed chickens.",

The concentration of VP2 protein in plants was determined by antigen-capture AC-ELISA (Corley et al. 2001) . Plates were coated at 4 \u2022 C overnight with polyclonal anti-IBDV-chicken serum diluted at 1:1000 in PBS buffer pH 8; washed 3 times with PBST (phosphatebuffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20) buffer; and blocked with PBST buffer containing 5% skim milk at 37 \u2022 C for 3 h. Plates were washed 3 times with PBST and then dried and stored at 4 \u2022 C. Since VP2 is about 20% of the IBDV genome, and approximately the same proportion of the viral particle (Lee et al. 2003) , the expression level of VP2 could be estimated from TSP measurements. Purified IBDV, 100 ml, was used as a standard to determine the concentration of VP2 in TSP by Bradford assay. VP2 concentration was estimated by TSP/5. VP2 antigen levels were estimated by AC-ELISA at OD 405 . Both control and transgenic plant extracts were analyzed similarly. The concentration of VP2 in transgenic plants was determined as % TSP and calculated as follows: where OD 405 (leaf extract) represents total soluble protein in leaf extracts detected by AC-ELISA, OD 405 (IBDV) represents total soluble protein in purified IBDV detected by AC-ELISA, and [VP2-IBDV] represents VP2 protein in purified IBDV calculated from purified IBDV concentration divided by five. Purified IBDV were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electro-blotting on to nitrocellulose membranes using Semi-dry Trans Blotter (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's instruction. Membranes were blocked with 3% (v/v) skim milk. After blotting, different lanes on nitrocellulose were separated. Each strip of nitrocellulose was independently probed with chicken serum orally immunized with leaf extracts from different transgenic lines and serum collected from chicken fed with untransformed plants and plants transformed with vector as negative controls. Monoclonal antibody against VP2 was used as positive control in preliminary experiment. The VP2 antibody produced in chicken in response to oral immunization and forming a complex with VP2 protein on the nitrocellulose was detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-chicken immunoglobulin G at a 1:1000 dilution following protocol of Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories.",

Natural bioencapsulation of hepatitis B surface antigen expressed in plants provided protection from degradation in the digestive tract near an immune effector's site in the gut (Kong et al. 2001) . VP2 protein is hydrophobic, and its antigenicity may be conformationdependent (Kibenge et al. 1990 ). VP2 has not been investigated with respect to its resistant to gut degradation. However, our result shows recognition of IBDV by the serum of chickens fed with plant extracts expressing VP2 suggests that the recombinant VP2 produced in plants had the capacity to invoke immune response in chicken.
