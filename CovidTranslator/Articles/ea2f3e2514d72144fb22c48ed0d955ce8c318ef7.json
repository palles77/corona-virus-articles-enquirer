Sanford proposed the idea of a fast and effective plant transformation by using the process of bioballistics, in which the DNA of target genes or recombinant plasmids were placed upon tungsten or gold microprojectiles placed onto the surface of teflon macroprojectiles. Both were then shot onto plant objects. This method received significant development because not only plants might be transformed in this way, but also other study objects, such as mice, frogs, rats, and their organs. The method was named as \"biolistic.\" Subsequently, this method and \"gene guns\" of different design, working at the base of inert gases (helium, argon), occupied the main position in the biotechnology of transgenic plants, because this method allowed to shoot large recombinant plasmids with high expressive constructs (Klein et al., 1987) .",

They created transgenic homoplasmic-transplastomic plants with not only high antigenic production, but also that of other proteins for enzyme replacement therapy that is very useful in humans. The most productive construct made by Daniell and coworkers was the creation of polycistronic joining of target gene, marker gene, and flanking recombinant fragments of genes in the intergenic region from the plastid of host plants. The placement of the target gene into the cistronic sequence of plastid genome allowed to increase the yield of the target gene of crystal toxic protein (Cry2Aa2) of Bacillus thuringiensis to 45.3% TSP and even more in tobacco leaves (De Cosa et al., 2001) . Table 10 .1 shows that the expression in plastid constructions exceeded up to 1000 times or more the expression at nuclear transformation. It should be mentioned that plastid transformation, with the use of selective marker genes of kanamycin resistance NPTII, resulted in the increase of the selective enzyme up to 23% TSP. Such vaccine preparations have doubtful value on account of their very high content of enzymes resistant to antibiotics.",

The employment of edible plant parts as a vaccine material-whose toxicity is practically close to zero due to the absence of cryptic pathogens that are potentially dangerous for humans, prions, harmful plant viruses, and other microbial pathogens-is very advisable. There is a point of view that, during transgenesis and recombination in plants, some features that can elicit allergy might be potentially revealed, as well as eliciting different types of autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular collapse, and disorders of central nervous system. However, from this point of view, the other expression systems (bacterial, baculoviral, yeast) have to appear to have more chances to realize cryptic dangerous properties as a result of recombination; for example, the presence of silenced transposons and retroposons that are capable to evoke serious diseases of epigenetic character. Therefore, even from this sophisticated position, plants as expression systems are safer and significantly more reliable candidates for the production of recombinant proteins, as well as peroral vaccines.",

This was seen in the work of De la Rosa et al.

Therefore, we used transformation directly into the fruits by the injection of agrobacterial suspension with gene HPV16 L1 into the basal part of fruit. Hongli et al. (2013) made the transformation of tobacco leaf disks with HPV16 L1 and obtained selected regenerants. Grown regenerants were extracted with the buffer, the extract was freeze-dried and the dry material was dialyzed. The preparation obtained was used as a vaccine in order to study immunogenicity on mice. The antibody response was weak when mice were vaccinated four times with a dose of 0.38 mkg, and the ELISA readings were lower than 1 unit of optical density after the measurement. In order to improve the immune response, mice were given thermolabile nontoxic LTB subunit B of enteropathogenic E. coli. The immune response increased greatly with the combined administration of HPV16 L1 vaccine material and LTB in mice serum. However, it was found that the use of LTB during peroral vaccination resulted in the destruction of gastroenteral tissues of mice, revealing bloodying and swelling.",

Moreover, as in the work by De la Rosa et al. (2009) , the intact freeze-dried ground material of tomato fruits, without any isolation and purification of antigenic proteins, was used for mice vaccination in our work. Our group found that any manipulations for isolation, purification, and concentration in vacuum, concentrator of antigenic protein HPV16 L1, as well SDS electrophoresis resulted in instability and in the loss of immunogenicity. The immunogenic capability of antigenic protein HPV16 L1 depends on the correct natural orientation of linear and conformational epitopes of the quaternary protein structure. Chemical or electrostatic forces held the natural conformation of epitopes on the virus capsid, and are strong enough to resist. But given the impact was in excess of the strength of binding between the amino acids of antigenic protein, for example, heating for 10 min at 100\u00b0C or 30 s in the microwave oven (our unpublished data), as well as using salt denatured buffer systems, immunogenicity (binding with antibodies) or in vivo with effector molecules of complement-as well as with mucosal immune structures of gut epithelial cells lining (GALT) mucosal associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) and other lymphoid tissues-was destroyed. Perhaps that was the reason for use of vaccine material in very high doses of virus-like particles (VLP) with large quantities of 40 mkg of each antigenic proteins during vaccination with well-known commercial vaccines, such as \"Gardasil\" and \"Cervarix\" where pseudovirions were sorbed on the amorphous hydroxyphosphate sulfate aluminum that had adjuvant properties.

Previously, during standard vaccination with vaccines obtained in bacterial or in baculoviral systems, the phenomenon of cross-reactive interaction of antibodies with antigens was unknown, and actually the reverse was observed, induced immune response by one type of HPV was not suitable for any other type of HPV immunity because antibodies revealed strong specificity only to one particular type of HPV.

This oligosaccharide is formed on the phosphate of donor molecule dolichol phosphate (isoprenoid derivative) docked in membranes of ER. All N-linked oligosaccharides retain a pentasaccharide core derived from the original 14 residues of oligosaccharide, and move with protein to the Golgi complex. The transferase involved in glycosylation with UDP-Nacetylglucosamine, UDP-mannose, and UDPG as cofactors is located on the internal luminal surface of the ER, and does not catalyze glycosylation of cytosolic proteins. At this time, the sorting of both ER and cytosolic resident proteins takes place. It is difficult to say how specific transferases to glycosyl residue bind with UDP, GDP, or ADP but, according to our unpublished data, the transferase from Zea mays L. encoded by the ugt gene uses equally both UDPG and ADPG in transgenic potato plants.",

The HPV16 L2 molecule is situated inside the L1 protein, and it is shielded here. Later on, it became clear that the minor protein L2 played a critical role in saving the HPV virion from first immune response, and that it did not allow the interaction with immune receptors of host mammal cells. On the basis of this phenomenon, there lies the ability of the minor L2 protein to expose temporary its own epitopes after furin cleavage of L1 pentamer, during the first steps of infection that are not reacted with the cell receptor; it is not recognized by these receptors and, as a whole event block, there followed the initiation of defensive processes. The antigenic variability of the L2 protein is low. During analysis with cross-reacted antibodies, the highly conserved sequence from 17 to 36 amino acid residues was found. The minimal linear epitope from 21 to 30 amino acid residues recognized by broadly neutralized antibody specific to 11 types of HPV, containing Cys22, Lys23, Thr27, Cys28, and Pro29, was inserted into capsid-forming carriers of HPV16 L1, core antigen HPV149, or nontoxic mutant CRM197 of the diphtheria toxin. The genetic constructs obtained expressed the pan-vaccine in E. coli with very high productivity against types of HPV 11, 16, 18, 45, 52, 58, and 59 .

Three sites of binding of E2 were presented in the space region between the site for binding the enhancer and TATA box; and before the site of binding the enhancer there is the fourth site of binding of the protein E2. As a whole, this zone before TATA box was destined as the region of origin and replication and, perhaps, it participated in this process as an essential transcriptional operator, blocking the initiation of replication. Besides this role, protein E2 was known for the role of direct binding of viral genome via transactivation domain of E2 to the chromatin of host cells by means of appropriate kinases. As such, the dual role of E2 protein is proposed in the regulation of cancerogenesis: the blocker of the initiation of replication in ori site, and the mediator in holding the ring genome of papillomavirus close to the chromatin (McBride and Jang, 2013) .",

Therefore, the most suitable methodology of recombinant biotechnologies employing expression vectors placed in one or other expressive systems has appeared. It was found that, in bacterial or yeast expression systems, only the simple and mostly diagnostic minibodies or Fab fragments carrying immunodeterminants could be obtained. But it was not possible to synthesize functionally active full-sized antibodies that reacted with complement proteins in bacterial or yeast expression systems because there was no appropriate folding, as well as due to the insufficient isomerization and the absence of the glycosylation proper to mammals.",

According to the design of the genetic construct, the glycoprotein of Ebola virus was connected to the C terminal of heavy chain of humanized monoclonal antibody 6D8 IgG that specifically joined to linear GPI. The construct was placed into agrobacterial vectors for transformation. The rate of the synthesis of antibody was high and, after agroinfection in 4-6 days, it accumulated up to 40 mkg/g of fresh weight of tobacco leaves. The dose of 10 mkg EIC with Ebola glycoprotein was injected into linear mice or in guinea pigs that gave 100% defense against Ebola virus. However, there were no trials on humans or primates. Charles Arntzen published in 2015 a study in which it was shown that EIC from tobacco leaves was successfully applied on volunteers at the time of the Ebola epidemic in Africa in 2014, when more than 10,000 people died from this disease. These scientists have also shown successfully that only antibodies with glycosylation were active in joining with the Ebola virus (Arntzen, 2015) .",
