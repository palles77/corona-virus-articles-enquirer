This therapeutic approach contrasts with vaccine approaches that aim to stimulate the endogenous immune response of the host, in order to provide sustained protective immunity. mAbs can diminish viral dissemination by direct action involving both their antigen-binding activity and the effector functions borne by their Fc fragment. So far, most antiviral mAbs with therapeutic potential have initially (and logically) been selected for their ability to neutralize virions via the recognition of viral surface antigens essential for receptor binding and/or entry into host Trends Antiviral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are promising, high-added-value biotherapeutics. During recent years, the number of antiviral mAbs developed against both acute and chronic viruses has grown exponentially, some of them being currently tested in clinical trials.",

In addition to complement-mediated inactivation of viral particles, and/or their phagocytosis, this also permits complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibodydependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to eliminate infected cells displaying viral antigens at their surface ( Figure 1A ). This, for instance, is the case of mAbs targeting the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV (and other lenti-/retroviruses) that is exposed at the surface of virus-producing cells. Finally, Fc-FcgR interactions can also directly impact viral propagation via a mechanism called antibodydependent, cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI) (see [19, [25] [26] [27] for more information on direct Fc-mediated antiviral effects). Thus, during immunotherapies, mAbs can impact viral propagation via a variety of direct mechanisms, possibly varying according to the virus, the viral antigen recognized and the antibody itself. However, there is now accumulating evidence that antiviral mAbs, upon interaction with different components of the immune system, can also operate via indirect mechanisms, that is, engagement of the host immune response, with effects lasting well beyond the treatment itself. Thus, similarly to vaccine approaches, mAb treatment could lead to the stimulation of the endogenous humoral and cellular immune responses in such a manner as to provide protective immunity ('vaccine-like effects').",

Such ICs can then be recognized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs), which are central for any adaptive immune responses ( Figure 1B) . Surprisingly, until recently, the scientific and medical communities have largely failed to take into consideration that this could impact the endogenous immunity (i.e., the enhancement of antibody responses as well as cytotoxic T-cell responses) of infected, immunotherapytreated patients. This is all the more puzzling as positive immunomodulatory (vaccine-like) effects, which strengthen the patients' immune defenses against viral infections, would translate into obvious benefits, not only for the patients, but also for healthcare systems that would benefit from both reduced cost and duration of treatment.",

First, most antiviral mAbs (if not all) were initially selected on the basis of their blunting effects on viral propagation. Second, models of viral infections in immunocompetent animals, allowing in-depth analyses of endogenous immune responses in the context of passive mAb-based immunotherapies, are scarce. This is especially true for relevant models of chronic infections by viruses such as HIV or HCV, against which most antiviral mAbs available to date were raised. Indeed, anti-HIV (and to a lesser extent anti-HCV) mAb activity was assessed mainly in immunocompromized, humanized mice reconstituting only partially the human immune system [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and/or nonhuman primates (NHPs). Although NHPs are extremely useful for assessing the protective effects of anti-HIV mAbs, their use in the study of immunity is limited due to both technical and cost reasons. In contrast, mouse infection systems offer numerous immunologic tools and permit cost-effective experimentation on large cohorts. Third, most often antiviral mAbs have been generated in species different from those used in the in vivo experiments and therefore Fc-associated effector functions were not, or not fully, preserved. Finally, ethical, technical, and economic reasons, together with the low number of ongoing clinical trials, still limit this type of investigation in humans.",

This most likely provides an inflammatory environment favoring the induction of the antiviral immune response. Moreover, ICs formed with infected cells are more efficiently captured by DCs than infected cells alone, leading to stronger functional DC activation and elicitation of a potent antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response ( Figure 2 , Key Figure) . Importantly, the endogenous antiviral antibodies generated by the immunotherapy allow containment of viral propagation and contribute to the maintenance of a T-cell memory response once the therapeutic antibody has been eliminated from treated mice [36, 37] .

Several reports now indicate that short treatments of SIV-infected macaques with neutralizing antibodies can lead to enhanced antiviral immunity [39, 40] . However, these experiments were performed with SIV-specific, highly neutralizing, polyclonal immune globulins (SIVIG) prepared from SIV-infected animals and not mAbs. In a first study, the SIVIG treatment could both significantly delay disease onset and increase the survival rate of SIVsmE660-infected Macaca mulatta macaques, with the long-term survivors showing accelerated de novo production of anti-SIV-neutralizing antibodies [39] . In another set of experiments, rhesus macaques treated with SIVIG shortly after SIVmac239 infection resulted in transiently detectable neutralizing-antibody responses followed by reduction in viral loads as compared to untreated macaques [41] . Interestingly, a virus-specific polyfunctional CD4 + T-cell response was also induced during the acute phase of infection and maintained elevated during the following chronic phase together with a CD8 + T-cell antiviral response measured by the appearance of CTLs specific to capsid (Gag). Intriguingly, no neutralizing antibodies could be measured during the latter phase (i.e., after SIVIG had disappeared) [40] , underlining a striking difference with the M. mulata macaque and FrCasE models for reasons that will have to be elucidated. Moreover, DCs stimulated in vitro with SIVIG-preincubated SIV were shown to activate virus-specific CD4 + T lymphocytes in an Fc-dependent manner, suggesting that enhanced T-cell priming during the immunotherapy period is dependent on antibody-mediated virion uptake by these APCs [41] . Such a conclusion is consistent with a former observation that MHC class Irestricted cross-presentation of SIV capsid protein (Gag) is enhanced by anti-Gag antibodies to generate stronger Gag-specific CD8 + T-cell responses in SIV-infected macaques [42] .",

Its use is pertinent to the assessment of the effects of HIV-neutralizing mAbs in NHP. Interestingly, 1month-old pigtail macaques treated with the human HIV-neutralizing mAb b12 (one of the first to be generated) combined with polyclonal SHIVIG before oral challenge with the SF162P3 SHIV strain, developed an accelerated neutralizing antibody response and showed reduced plasma viremia for at least 6 months [43] . However, in this infection model, despite very high persistent viremia, there was no evidence of pathogenesis in the 6-month period of the study precluding the assessment of viral disease protection by the mAb-induced B-cell response. In contrast, such a study was performed using oral infection of 1-month-old rhesus macaques with the same virus, which leads to disease manifestation within 12 weeks. In this model, passive immunotherapy with polyclonal SHIVIG, 24 h prior to infection, reduced viral propagation, accelerated de novo neutralizing antibody production (also translating into ADCVI), and was associated with protection from disease [44] . These data are consistent with the concept of protective immunomodulatory effects induced by passive immunotherapies with neutralizing antibodies, at least when administered at the time of infection. These effects, however, also seem possible upon mAb treatment at a much later time. For example, the administration of either a cocktail of HIV-1specific mAbs (PGT121, 3BNC117, and b12), or of the PGT121 mAb alone, 9 months after SHIV-SF162P3 infection of rhesus macaques resulted in the rapid decline of plasma viremia to undetectable levels correlating with a slight increase in neutralizing antibody titers. Interestingly, this humoral response was complemented by a T-cell response characterized by a significant improvement of the functionality of Gag-specific CD8 + and CD4 + T lymphocytes (manifested by a decreased expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1) despite there being no change in their numbers. Moreover, if virus rebounded in the majority of animals when serum mAb had disappeared, a subset of animals maintained long-term virological control in the absence of further mAb infusions [23] . Overall, these data demonstrate a strong therapeutic effect of potent neutralizing HIV-1-specific mAb in SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys as well as a positive impact on their immune response. These findings are potentially important, as very recently the 3BNC117 mAb has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing HIV-1 viremia in a phase 1 human clinical trial [45] .",

For example, the prophylactic treatment of RSV, an acute cytopathic virus, by a neutralizing mAb (131-2G) directed towards its G attachment protein (that also has strong immunosuppressive activity) can shift the adaptive immune response from the Th2-to the Th1-type [47]. Thus, 131-2G mAbtreated mice infected with the RSV r19F strain show an enhanced and sustained humoral response characterized by an increased ratio of anti-RSV IgG2a to IgG1, as compared with nontreated, infected mice. Moreover, the stimulation and skewing of the humoral response also correlate with an increase in follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and a higher frequency of CD8 + T cells directed to infected cells. It should be noted, however, that the effects on B-cell and T-cell responses are not Fc-dependent, as the 131-2G F(ab 0 ) 2 fragment leads to the same shift of the adaptive immune response as the whole mAb [48, 49] .

Upon rapid infusion of the human HeVneutralizing mAb m102.4, infected monkeys survive after having transiently displayed neurologic symptoms [50] . Recovery from disease correlates with the mounting of a protective humoral immune response reducing the viral load. Interestingly, the 102.4 mAb cross-reacts with NiV and using it in post-exposure therapy of NiV-infected African green monkeys also leads to the development of an antiviral humoral response, which, most likely, both limits viral dissemination and contributes to protection from NiV disease [51] . Thus, the cross-reactive m102.4 mAb, which is currently being developed for human use as a Nipah-and Hendra-virus countermeasure [52] , shows exceptional efficacy, not only because of its direct antiviral action, but probably also through its ability to affect endogenous immunity.",

This could be achieved using the anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 mAbs that are currently used to treat cancer (reviewed in [54, 55] .

This suggests that Fc engineering could represent an avenue to not only improve direct mAb antiviral efficacy but also to induce stronger vaccine-like effects. In particular, enhancing the affinity of mAbs for the FcgRs displayed by APCs could be achieved via the modification of the FcgRs' peptide-binding motifs or via the production of mAbs with altered glycosylation (which can enhance binding to FcgR) [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] . Indeed, Fc-engineered glycovariants were shown to enhance Fc-mediated reduction of viral replication and FcgR binding in different in vitro infection settings for Ebola virus and HIV [82, 83] . Also supporting this idea, spontaneous control of HIV and improved antiviral activity correlated with a dramatic shift in the global antibody-glycosylation profile toward agalactosylated glycoforms [84] . Another interesting possibility of Fc engineering may aim at enhancing the binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expressed by various adult cell types [85] . Not only could this lead to increased mAb halflife in vivo [85] but also to stronger vaccine-like effects. Indeed, FcRn cross-linking on APCs by multivalent ICs has been shown to entail stronger humoral and cellular adaptive responses in certain infection settings [86, 87] . In addition, an enhanced FcRn function of the broadly neutralizing mAb VRC01 improved protection against SHIV infection in macaques [88] .",

This approach would mainly concern enveloped viruses, as they display their viral receptor-binding proteins at the surface of virusproducing cells. The fact that cellular ICs are crucial for inducing long-lasting immunity against FrCasE by neutralizing mAbs (see above) [36] substantiates this idea. In addition, HIV-infected cells are stronger inducers of innate immunity than cell-free virions [96] , and HCV-infected hepatocytes have been reported to affect DC maturation and the subsequent activation of NK cells and T cells, whereas free virus could not [97] , indicating that infected cells may be stronger inducers of immunity compared to virions. It is now important to establish whether the antigenic potential of such infected cells can be further enhanced upon opsonization with antiviral mAbs, as in the case of FrCasE.",

A major issue is now to translate this observation into human applications for the benefit of both patients and society (see Outstanding Questions). Much more research towards this aim is, however, still necessary. In particular, it will be essential to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby viral and cellular ICs formed during immunotherapy induce protective immunity and, then, determine the best means to exploit them therapeutically. It is also likely that improving the effector function of antiviral mAbs and/or combining them with other therapeutics will be necessary to achieve sterilizing immunity against infecting agents or, at least, their longterm containment.",

(A) Upon administration, an antiviral mAb can opsononize virus, as well as infected cells if the viral antigen is also expressed on their surface. This can lead to virus elimination by complement activation and/or phagocytosis mediated by cells of the innate immune system. Infected cells can also be eliminated by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) as well as by antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) mediated by FcgRbearing effector cells. (B) Immune complexes (IC), constituted by mAb-coated virions or infected cells, can be recognized by FcgRs expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DC). Such IC recognition leads to enhanced antigen uptake and presentation, allowing induction of stronger humoral and cellular antiviral immune responses. Abbreviation: NK cells, natural killer cells.",

At the same time, the immune complexes (ICs) formed with the virus, and probably more importantly with infected cells expressing Env at their surface, prevent the expansion of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) (c), which is necessary for the development of protective humoral (d) and cellular (e, f) responses by the host. In particular, the ICs formed between the therapeutic mAbs and infected cells activate dendritic cells (DCs), leading to an enhanced virus-specific CD8 T-cell response (f). Once the therapeutic antibody has been eliminated from treated mice, both arms of the adaptive immune system contribute to viral propagation control, as the endogenous antiviral antibodies, induced by the immunotherapy, control viral propagation (g, h) and contribute to the maintenance of a T-cell memory response. This requires the formation of ICs engaging residual infected cells and activation of DCs (i). Abbreviation: ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.",

The identification of the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the induction of vaccine-like effects by antiviral mAbs will be paramount to the improvement of future antiviral passive immunotherapies. They are currently the object of intense research. Furthermore, several possibilities pertaining to the conditions of mAb administration, the mAbs themselves, and their targets, can already be considered. These include combined therapies affecting viral propagation and/or enhancing immune responses; engineering mAbs to improve their effector functions, i.e., increasing their binding to Fcg receptors (FcgRs) by affecting their glycosylation or their amino acid sequence; pertinent selection of their isotype; taking into account FcgR polymorphisms in patients to be treated; and selecting the most appropriate viral antigens.",
