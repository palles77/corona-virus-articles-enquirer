Here, we analyzed the cleavability of RV P200-derived substrates varying in their N-terminal lengths (72-475 amino acids) from the cleavage site by the RV protease trans-activity. Only substrates with at least 309 amino acid residues N-terminal to the cleavage site were able to undergo cleavage. Further, rubella sequence was found to be necessary in the N-terminal region of the substrate, whereas a heterologous sequence C-terminal to the cleavage site was tolerated. These results demonstrated a requirement for residues located between amino acids 994-1102 of the RV P200 polyprotein, besides its cleavage site for RV protease trans-activity. This region overlaps with the starting site of the essential cis-protease activity of RV P200 polyprotein. This is a novel observation for a viral protease of the family Togaviridae.",

In an infected cell, RV mRNA first translates into a P200 nonstructural polypeptide [2] . Newly synthesized P200 often undergoes ciscleavage at NH 2 -SRGG 1301/1302 G-COOH into two mature nonstructural proteins, P150 and P90, by a protease domain contained within the C-terminal region of P150 [3, 9, 11, 18] . The viral P200 nonstructural polyprotein contains four conserved functional domains that are involved in viral RNA synthesis and replication. They are sequentially located from the N terminus to the C terminus, as methyltransferase, protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains based on bioinformatic analysis [4, 6] . The first two motifs are located on the N and C termini of P150, and the latter two are on the N and C termini of P90 [5, 13] .",

Subsequently, the P150-protease trans-activity cleaves these P200 molecules to signal the replication complex to switch to positivestrand RNA synthesis mode. However, besides the presence of the cleavage site, what the internal sequence requirements of the P200 and its intermediaries for RV protease trans-cleavage activity are, and how the cis-activity of P200 is regulated to maintain optimal negative RNA synthesis have not been identified.",

Our analysis identified a region in the substrate corresponding to residues 994-1102 of the P200 polyprotein that is required for the protease trans-activity, and this region overlaps with the starting site of the essential cis-protease activity of RV P200 polyprotein. Potential implications of the requirement of the cis-activity region of P200 substrates for the RV protease trans-activity are discussed.",

Similarly, to test whether a heterologous sequence on the N-terminal side of the cleavage site affects substrate recognition by the protease trans-activity, GFP ORF was fused in-frame at the N-terminus of the rubella sequence in the plasmid pRVS-1102-1548 to create pRVS-GFP-1102-1548 (Fig. 1B) . The template for the PCR in both cases was pBRM33-C1152S. (A) Shows pBRM33-G1301S-derived P200 that was used as a PCR-template to clone the trans-active protease region. The P150 and P90 domains of P200 are indicated. The protease catalytic residue, Cys at amino acid 1152 (C1152) and a cleavage site substitution mutation (Gly to Ser) at P150 C-terminal residue, 1301 (G1301S, represented by 'X' in the P150 box and by a black circle on the top) are as shown. The mutation eliminates the cis-activity of the protease, leaving its trans-activity intact [8] . Numbers (1-2115) on the side represent amino acid residues of P200. The trans-active protease domain spans from amino acid position 827 to 1301 [8] . Expression plasmid, pRVP contains this protease domain in-frame flanked by an N-terminal Xpress epitope tag (hatched box) and a C-terminal GFP ORF.

HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with pRVP (Protease, Fig. 1A) , and each of the substrate expression plasmids, pRVS-827-1548, pRVS-994-1548, pRVS-1102-1548, and pRVS-1228-1548. Each substrate plasmid expressed RV P200-derived polypeptides of different N-terminal lengths (72-475 residues) from the cleavage site (Fig. 1B) . Following transfection, cell lysates were prepared, and the proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The substrates as well as the protease all had an Xpress epitope tag at their N-terminus. Our analysis of RV protease substrates revealed that homologous polypeptides of N-terminal 475-and 309-residue length from the cleavage site, expressed from pRVS-827-1548 and pRVS-994-1548 (Fig. 2 , lanes 2 and 4, 80 and 67 kDa, respectively), were able to undergo cleavage when co-expressed along with RV protease (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 3, and 5 , 110 kDa) with an expected size of the N-terminal cleaved products of 55-and 37-kDa size (with additional Xpress epitope residues), respectively (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5) .

Also note that the protease was able to cleave the RVS-GFP substrate with a GFP on the C-terminal side of the cleavage site to a lesser extent (<50%), as a significant portion of the substrate remained uncleaved strates of N-terminal 199-and 72-residue length from the cleavage site (plus the Xpress epitope residues), expressed from pRVS-1102-1548 and pRVS-1228-1548, respectively (Fig. 2, lanes, 6 and 8 , 55-and 37-kDa), did not undergo cleavage when co-expressed along with the protease (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 9) as evidenced by the lack of Xpress-tagged N-terminal cleavage products detected in the immunoblot analysis. (If the substrates were cleaved, the expected sizes of the N-terminal products would be 25 kDa and 14 kDa, respectively.) This clearly suggests that amino acid residues residing between residues 200-308 in the substrate are required in order for the substrate to be targeted by the trans-activity of the protease.",

If indeed an internal domain within the 309-substrate is being recognized by the protease, then this sequence should be present in the N-terminal region of 309-substrate. To verify the above hypothesis, we utilized plasmid pRVS-GFP-1102-1548 (Fig. 1) , which expresses a chimeric substrate in which the 199-substrate was extended at its N-terminus by GFP to compensate for the length (increased from 199 to 479 amino acids) along with the protease plasmid, pRVP.

Although the N-terminal length was increased in the chimeric GFP-199-substrate (Lane 4), it still failed to undergo cleavage when coexpressed with the protease (Lane 5), suggesting that it is not the N-terminal length from the cleavage site that is required of the substrate, but in fact it is the internal sequence present within the substrate that is recognized by the protease for trans-processing. The internal recognition domain identified in this report corresponds to amino acid [8] . In the bottom panel, the protease substrate P200 is depicted with the location of the newly identified domain required for protease trans-activity (this report), which overlaps with the protease cis-activity starting site of P200 position 994-1102 of RV P200. This region overlaps with the N-terminal site of the essential cis-protease activity region on the P200 described by Liang et al. [8] . The location of the substrate recognition region (this report) relative to the essential cis-activity domain is illustrated in Fig. 4 . At this time we could not refine the recognition region further, as plasmids with deletions in this region of RV cDNA could not be rescued in bacteria.",

Results presented with RV protease (which has been functionally demonstrated to be similar to P150 activity [8] ) demonstrated that the protease trans-activity recognizes a region N-terminal to the cleavage site in the P200-derived substrates. Thus, the trans-protease activity requires not only specific amino acids present at or proximal to the cleavage site, but also sequences upstream at a distance from the cleavage site. We also demonstrated that, on the C-terminal side of the cleavage site, heterologous residues unrelated to RV are somewhat tolerated by the protease, but we routinely observed (in three separate experiments) that the efficiency of the protease trans-activity on this type of substrate was less than 50% (illustrated in Fig. 2, lane 11) . This clearly suggests that the P90 domain residing on the C-terminal side of the cleavage site in P200 does influence the trans-activity of the protease. In another positivestranded RNA virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), one of the two virus-encoded proteases, PLP-1 (PCP), demonstrates a homologous substrate length requirement on the C-terminal side of the cleavage site and the cleavage efficiency increases with increasing substrate and enzyme polypeptide length, although in this case, the protease recognition sequence on the substrate was not identified [15] . The RV protease trans-activity-associated P200 internal sequence requirement, as identified here, is unique, and this is the first such report for the viruses that belong to the family Togaviridae.",

They further speculated that this proline-rich X domain could serve as a protein-protein interaction domain that enhances the opportunity to meet its trans-cleavage substrate [8] . However, in this report, we clearly demonstrate by deletion analysis that the X domain in the substrate is dispensable for recognition by RV protease trans-activity and the actual recognition region is located downstream of the X domain, overlapping with the N-terminal starting-site (a term coined by Liang et al. [8] ) of the essential cis-activity domain of the substrate. Our results show that RV P150-associated protease trans-activity requires a specific region within the P200 that represents P150 itself (illustrated in Fig. 4 ). Taken together, our studies and those of Liang et al. [8] advance the field in enhancing our understanding of the molecular determinants that define the rubivirus protease trans-activity requirements that are essential for RV replication.",

            "text": "In this report, we have shown that RV protease trans-activity demonstrates substrate specificity by requiring an internal sequence within the region that is N-terminal to the cleavage site. Identification of a region in the P200-related sequence-containing substrate (we utilized polypeptides from amino acid positions 827 to1548 of P200 or shorter) that is important for RV protease transactivity suggests that this region may offer a specific fold or a conformation to the P200 substrate to facilitate cleavage by the protease. Since most protease-substrate interactions involve transient binding of the protease to its cognate substrate, it is conceivable that RV protease trans-activity on homologous substrates also involves transient binding of protease to the substrate, and such binding perhaps could occur within the sequence that is required on the substrate for protease transactivity. We attempted to perform coimmunoprecipitation experiments to establish the protease-substrate binding following cotransfection of cells with both plasmid constructs, but failed to obtain reproducible results, perhaps due to the transient nature of the interaction. However, if this binding truly occurs in the viral infection cycle, then, as RV protease is recognizing itself as substrate in the essential cis-activity region for the trans-activity (illustrated in Fig. 4) , it is tempting to speculate that the trans-activity may be regulating the cis-activity of P200. This process could explain how P200 remains as P200 in the replication complex to initiate viral negative-strand RNA synthesis. As discussed in the introduction, previous experimental evidence suggested that P200 initiates the synthesis of viral negative-strand RNA, and its cleavage into P150 and P90 plays a critical role in switching the replication complex to the positive RNA synthesis mode [8] . In this context, our results leads us to speculate that perhaps the P150-protease transactivity requirement of the P200 sequence within its essential cis-activity region (illustrated in Fig. 4 ) could transiently stall the P200 cis-protease activity, provided that P150 binds to P200 in this region, to allow the negative-strand RNA synthesis to occur. This certainly is a verifiable future experimental direction to capture viral events that further enhance our understanding of the rubivirus proteases.",
