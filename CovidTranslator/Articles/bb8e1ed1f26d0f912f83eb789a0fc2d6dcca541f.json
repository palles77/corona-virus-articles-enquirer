In this study, attenuated canine distemper virus (CDV) was used as a vaccine delivery vector and duplex 2-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays specific for genomic RNA (gRNA) or mRNA have been developed that concurrently quantify coding sequences for the CDV nucleocapsid protein (N) and a foreign vaccine antigen (SIV Gag). These amplicons, which had detection limits of about 10 copies per PCR reaction, were used to show that abdominal cavity lymphoid tissues were a primary site of CDV vector replication in infected ferrets, and importantly, CDV gRNA or mRNA was undetectable in brain tissue. In addition, the gRNA duplex assay was adapted for monitoring foreign gene insert genetic stability during in vivo replication by analyzing the ratio of CDV N and SIV gag genomic RNA copies over the course of vector infection. This measurement was found to be a sensitive probe for assessing the in vivo genetic stability of the foreign gene insert.",

Accordingly, it is an enveloped virus that has a single-stranded, non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome. The genome contains six gene regions organized 3 -N-P-M-F-H-L-5 , which encode eight known viral polypeptides (McIlhatton et al., 1997) . CDV, which is related to measles virus (MeV), causes systemic disease in domestic and wild dogs, foxes and wolves. CDV outbreaks also occur among small carnivores including mink and ferrets (Trebbien et al., 2014) and the virus has been linked to disease in lions, tigers, and seals (Harder and Osterhaus, 1997) . Natural infection in canines can lead to central nervous system disease, and experimental infection in ferrets with some CDV strains also results in neuroinvasion and neurovirulence after intranasal inoculation (Langlois, 2005; Rudd et al., 2006) .",

Notably, systems exist for genetic manipulation, they can be delivered mucosally, and in some cases, live attenuated vaccine viruses are available that can be used as the foundation for a vaccine delivery vector (Billeter et al., 2009; Bukreyev et al., 2006) . For example, attenuated MeV strains have been used to develop experimental vaccine vectors expressing antigens from hepatitis B virus (del Valle et al., 2007; Singh et al., 1999) , HIV or SIV (Brandler and Tangy, 2008; Lorin et al., 2012; Tangy and Naim, 2005; Zuniga et al., 2007) , West Nile virus (Despres et al., 2005) , Dengue virus (Brandler et al., 2007) , SARS-Coronavirus (Liniger et al., 2008) , and hepatitis C virus (Satoh et al., 2010) . Although MeV is an attractive vector candidate because of its long track record of use in humans, pre-existing neutralizing immunity against MeV might limit its use. Since recombinant CDV (rCDV) can express foreign proteins (Ludlow et al., 2012; Parks et al., 2002; von Messling et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2012) , attenuated CDV vectors encoding SIV immunogens have been developed to evaluate whether they might provide a safe alternative to MeV for advancement of HIV vaccine candidates that are less subject to pre-existing anti-MeV antibodies (Zhang et al., 2013) .",

These assays, though proven and useful, are time consuming and require several days to weeks to obtain results. Recently, several RT-PCR and nested PCR based assays have been developed for the diagnosis of CDV nucleocapsid protein RNA in cerebrospinal fluid, nasal swabs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, saliva, serum, urine, and whole blood of dogs (Frisk et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2001; Rzezutka and Mizak, 2002; Saito et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2004; von Messling et al., 1999) . These assays are very sensitive, but sensitivity varies with sample source, viral RNA extraction methods, and choice of primers. More recently, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR) assays have been developed for the detection of CDV (Elia et al., 2006; Fischer et al., 2013; Meli et al., 2009; Pawar et al., 2011; Scagliarini et al., 2007; Wilkes et al., 2014) and many other viruses including rabies virus (Hughes et al., 2004) , blue-tongue virus (Toussaint et al., 2007) , SIV (Cline et al., 2005) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) . These assays have been valuable in providing estimates of the viral load in plasma, and infected tissues and organs of animals.",

Singleplex RT-qPCR assays were optimized for specific detection of an essential CDV gene (CDV N) or the foreign SIV gag insert sequence in gRNA or mRNA, and duplex RT-qPCR assays were developed to detect simultaneously CDV N and SIV gag gRNAs or mRNAs in homogenized tissue specimens from ferrets inoculated with CDV vector encoding Gag or the vector lacking an insert. These assays enabled rapid, reliable, and sensitive detection of CDV N and SIV gag and were used to compile in vivo data on replication, distribution, and genetic stability of an early prototype rCDV-SIV-Gag vector. Importantly, by using the gRNA duplex assay to monitor the relative quantities of CDV N and SIV gag sequences in vector genomes over the course of infection, gag insert instability was detected in the vector prototype, providing valuable information for guiding vector and gene insert improvements that stabilized foreign genes in subsequent vaccine designs (Zhang et al., 2013) .",

Briefly, virus from a live attenuated vaccine based on the Onderstepoort strain was serially passaged in Vero cells after which a clonal isolate was derived by multiple rounds of plaque purification. The genome of the plaque isolate was sequenced and a molecular clone was constructed with genomic RNA synthesis placed under control of the T7 promoter in Bluescript II SK (+/\u2212) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The molecular clone was then modified by insertion of SIVmac239 gag gene, which was codon-optimized for mammalian cell expression (Winstone et al., 2011) , into the first genomic position of the CDV genome to produce the rCDV-SIVgag1 cDNA (Fig. 1A) .

The CDV N gene was selected as an amplicon because it is an essential gene. Additionally, insertion of gag in the first position of the genome was anticipated to reduce N mRNA synthesis (Wertz et al., 1998) ; thus it was of interest to measure the relative quantities of N mRNA expressed from recombinant virus with or without the gag gene insert (Fig. 1A) . The forward and reverse primers (Operon, Huntsville, AL, USA) and oligonucleotide probes (Applied Biosystems, Valencia, CA, USA) are shown in Table 1 . The CDV-specific mRNA RT-primer used in the singleplex or duplex assay to synthesize cDNA from mRNA was designed with a 22-base adapter sequence at the 5 end (Craggs et al., 2001; Simon et al., 2010) , followed by a 20-base oligo-dT sequence, and a 3 -terminal 5-base anchor (ATAAT) that was complimentary to a unique UAUUA sequence common to CDV N and SIV gag mRNA transcripts (Table 1 and Fig. 1B ). This adapter primer was designed to overcome any signal that might be caused by gRNA self-priming and also improve qPCR specificity (Craggs et al., 2001; Lanford et al., 1994; Simon et al., 2010) . In order to discriminate between the N and gag sequences in the duplex assay, the CDV N probe was labeled at the 5 end with the reporter dye 6-carboxyrhodamine 6G (VIC) and the SIV gag probe with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM). The 3 ends were labeled with a nonfluorescent black hole quencher and a minor groove binder (MGB) moiety. ",

The lower limit of detection for the synthetic RNA oligonucleotides templates was 10 copies of RNA template per reaction. The specificity of each of singleplex reaction was confirmed by switching target templates (1 \u00d7 10 8 copies) to observe whether cross priming amplification would occur, and in both singleplex assays, the primer-probe set detected only its specific target (data not shown).",

Since N is an essential gene, changes in N-to-gag ratio during replication would likely result from deletion of gag insert sequences, thus the duplex RT-qPCR assay must be able to detect reduced quantities of the gag gRNA target under conditions when N gRNA remained abundant. This was studied by conducting the duplex reaction with the N oligoribonucleotide template held constant at 1 \u00d7 10 7 copies per RT-qPCR reaction while titrating serially the gag template 10-fold over a range from 1 \u00d7 10 7 to 1 \u00d7 10 3 copies, and in a similar experiment where the N template was held at 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies per RT-qPCR reaction while titrating serially the gag template 10-fold from 1 \u00d7 10 4 to 1 \u00d7 10 1 copies. All samples were tested in duplicate in the duplex RT-qPCR assay and the results are summarized in Supplemental Fig. 2 . When the N oligoribonucleotide template was held at 1 \u00d7 10 7 copies per reaction, the N C T value (dark bars) remained steady as the quantity of gag template (light bars) varied (Supplemental Fig. 2A ). Similar results were obtained when the N oligoribonucleotide was held constant at a lower concentration of 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies (Supplemental Fig. 2B ). In both experiments, the measured SIV gag C T values were in accordance with the expected C T values even in the presence of a high CDV N template background of 1 \u00d7 10 7 or 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies ( Table 2) , and the SIV gag templates could be detected at a PCR efficiency of 81% or 74% respectively (Supplemental Fig. 2A and  B) . Importantly, this result demonstrated that the duplex assay could reliably quantify copies of N and gag sequence even when the input proportions were varied over a wide range. This result showed that the duplex assay provided the foundation for an assay to study genetic stability during in vivo replication.",

It is known that the relative quantities of mRNAs expressed by negative-sense RNA viruses, like CDV, measles virus and VSV, is determined by a transcriptional gradient in which genes proximal to the single 3 genomic promoter (Fig. 1A) are expressed in greater quantities compared to genes distal from this promoter (Abraham and Banerjee, 1976; Cattaneo et al., 1987) , thus high levels of SIV gag mRNA and somewhat less N was anticipated. Quantities of N mRNA peaked at greater than 1 \u00d7 10 6 copies/g in the mesenteric lymph nodes and large intestine high density Peyer's patches at day 7 and were low but detectable at 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies/g in large intestine low density Peyer's patches (Fig. 3C) . N mRNA remained detectable at day 28 in mesenteric lymph nodes, but was below the limit of detection in large intestine sections. At day 55, N mRNA was undetectable in all tissues. Early after infection at day 7, the gag mRNA was more abundant (Fig. 3D) than N in all tissues as expected based on its placement in a highly transcribed region of the CDV genome. Gag mRNA quantities also exceeded N at day 28 even though results with the genomic qPCR assay described above predicted that gag mRNA would decline more rapidly compared to N (see Sections 3.6 and 4). Taken together, these results showed that gRNA persisted for at least 55 days, but that mRNA levels were undetectable by this time point suggesting that the persisting genomes might be defective or that transcription and replication is greatly reduced in the population of cells that harbor persisting CDV gRNA.",

Instead of the expected 1.6 kb RT-PCR product indicative of an intact gag gene, a small fragment of about 200 bases was detected (Fig. 5A ). When the smaller PCR product was sequenced, the results showed that there was a deletion starting near the 5 end of the Gag coding sequence (3 end with respect to the negative-sense viral genome), which extended through most of the gag gene (the first 1416 nucleotides from the 1542 genome) leaving only 126 nucleotides (Fig. 5B) corresponding to the c-terminal coding sequence of Gag. Since the deleted region contained the annealing sites (nucleotides 256-339; Fig. 1D and 5B) for the Gag-specific qPCR primers and probe for the gRNA assay, the changing N-to-gag gRNA ratio did reflect emergence of a deletion mutant ( Fig. 3B and 4B ). The remaining 126 nucleotides, which is just before the AUUAU sequence adjoining the poly(A) tail, maintained the annealing sites for the SIV gag forward primer and the probe used in the SIV gag mRNA RT-qPCR assay (Fig. 1D) ; thus, this truncated gag sequence which includes the gag mRNA amplicon contributed to the high mRNA-specific signals seen at day 7 following IN (Fig. 3D) and IM (Fig. 4D) vaccination.",

The assays described in this report differ because they are designed to monitor the course of an infection in an animal model, study gag gene delivery by a CDV-SIV gag vector, and differentiate between genomic and mRNA species. In addition, for mRNA analysis, a primer for the RT-step was designed that included an adapter sequence and a 5-nucleotide sequence at the 3 end that was specific for SIV gag and CDV N mRNAs, which significantly reduced background from cellular RNA and positive-sense vector genomic RNA and also helped to eliminate amplification of DNA caused by RNA self-priming (Craggs et al., 2001; Simon et al., 2010) . More recently, an RT-qPCR assay was reported (Pawar et al., 2011) based on SYBR Green I chemistry for detection of the hemagglutinin gene in samples from infected dogs. This assay used oligo-dT primers to synthesize cDNA from mRNA in the RT step and a relative C T quantification method to determine fold changes in CDV gene expression. Using the TaqMan system described here, permitted absolute quantification of gRNA and mRNA and also multiplexing of CDV N and SIV gag amplicons.",

            "text": "Recombinant CDV is being investigated as a delivery vector for HIV vaccines because it has the potential to specifically deliver vaccine immunogens to lymphoid tissues that are susceptible to HIV infection Zhang et al., 2013) . Previous studies showed that virulent CDV replicated in the ferret gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) (Pillet et al., 2009; von Messling et al., 2006) , and this work extends those results by showing that a recombinant vector based on an attenuated vaccine strain also targeted the GALT. After intranasal inoculation with the empty rCDV vector, abundant quantities of gRNA (>10 8 copies/g) were detected in ferret GALT at day 7 that persisted out to day 21. Viral mRNA similarly was detected and was highest at day 7. Genomes also were evident at day 1 in large intestine high density Peyer's patches and in mesenteric lymph nodes, but mRNA was not detectable at this early timepoint. The lack of an mRNA signal at day 1 probably was due to this being an early time point during virus replication at this secondary site of infection. CDV N gRNA was detectable out to day 55 in ferret tissues, but mRNA was out to day 28 (Figs. 3 and 4) were observed. This result might indicate that persisting genomes were defective or that their transcriptional activity was low, which was consistent with the lack of detectable infectious virus in tissues harvested at day 55. Interestingly, results from a number of studies indicate that negative-strand RNA virus genomes persist for considerable periods of time post-infection. Genomic RNA from measles virus (Lin et al., 2012; Pan et al., 2005 Pan et al., , 2010 Riddell et al., 2007) and vesicular stomatitis virus Cooper et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2009 Johnson et al., , 2007 Letchworth et al., 1996; Simon et al., 2007 Simon et al., , 2010 Turner et al., 2007) could be detected in tissues well after shedding of infectious virus had ended.",

Traditional RT-PCR and genome sequencing using a subset of day-7 and day-28 samples from the intranasal and intramuscular studies confirmed that the gag gene was unstable and that vector variants emerged with most of the insert deleted during replication in vivo. The deleted sequences included the target RT-qPCR amplicon used to detect gag in the gRNA assay, which explained reduction in signal compared to the N amplicon. This result also demonstrated that the duplex qPCR assay and gene quantity ratios could be used to effectively monitor gene insert stability in vivo, which provided valuable practical data for guiding future vector development by specifically showing that for some foreign genes alternative gene optimization approaches were needed to generate genetically stable negative-strand RNA virus vectors (Rabinovich et al., 2014) .",

Because this truncated gag gene contained the target amplicon sequence for the gag mRNA-specific RT-qPCR assay, abundant mRNA signal was observed even as the mutant virus emerged and became a dominant species in the infected ferrets. This was consistent with results that showed SIV gag mRNA was generally 3-10-fold more abundant than CDV N mRNA as anticipated based on the promoter-proximal placement of the gag gene (Wertz et al., 1998) .",

(A). Transcriptional attenuation resulting in a gradient of mRNA synthesis such that the gag message is more abundant than the N message in the rCDV-SIVgag1 vector; the rCDV vector is a Vero cell adapted, Onderstepoort live-attenuated CDV vaccine (Galaxy D, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation, Omaha, NE, USA) obtained through a commercial source; and the rCDV-SIVgag1 vector with the Gag gene in the first position of the genome and a unique UAUAAU sequence common to CDV N and SIV gag genomes. (B). Diagram of the RT step used in the singleplex or duplex assay to synthesize cDNA from mRNA. The CDV-specific mRNA RT-primer that binds to a unique UAUUA sequence common only to CDV N and SIV gag mRNA transcripts, has a 22-base adapter sequence at the 5 end followed by a 20-base oligo-dT sequence, and a 3 -terminal 5-base anchor (ATAAT).
