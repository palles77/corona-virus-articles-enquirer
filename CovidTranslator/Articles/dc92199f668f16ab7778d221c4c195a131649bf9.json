The annual concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 \u03bcm (PM 10 ), ranging from 141 to 166 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 in 2000-2004, could be very harmful to human health. In this paper, we presented the mortality and morbidity effects of PM 10 pollution based on statistical data and the epidemiological exposure-response function. The economic costs to health during the 5 years were estimated to lie between US$1670 and $3655 million annually, accounting for about 6.55% of Beijing's gross domestic product each year. The total costs were apportioned into two parts caused by: the local emissions and long-range transported pollution. The contribution from local emissions dominated the total costs, accounting on average for 3.60% of GDP. However, the contributions from transported pollution cannot be neglected, and the relative percentage to the total costs from the other regions could account for about 45%. An energy policy and effective measures should be proposed to reduce particulate matter, especially PM 2.5 pollution in Beijing to protect public health. The Beijing government also needs to cooperate with the other local governments to reduce high background level of particulate air pollution.",

According to the World Bank, 16 of the world's 20 most polluted cities are in China (Economist, 2004) . Urban air pollution has become a barrier to sustainable development. Beijing, as a megacity (with a population of \u2265 10 million; Gurjar and Lelieveld, 2005) and the capital of China, has a very serious air pollution problem. The concentration of particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 \u03bcm (PM 10 ) monitored by the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB) Science of the Total Environment 376 (2007) 100 -108 www.elsevier.com/locate/scitotenv from 2000 to 2004 indicated that particulate matter was a major problem in Beijing (BJEPB, 2000 (BJEPB, -2004 . During these years, the annual PM 10 concentrations ranged between 141 and 166 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 and were nearly three times the Grade 1 national standard, i.e., 50 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 . Epidemiological research using time series methods has shown the relationship between ambient PM concentrations and human health in Beijing (Dong et al., 1995; Chang et al., 2003a,b) and has quantified the daily mortality and morbidity relative to PM concentrations. With the 2008 Olympic Games approaching, the air quality in Beijing must be improved to project a positive image of the city to the world. While toxicological studies can determine how PM impacts the human respiratory system, economic assessments are also required for the public and the policy makers. Relevant research has been carried out in some cities and countries around the world (Beirut, Lebanon: El-Fadel and Massoud, 2000; Singapore: Quah and Boon, 2003; Shanghai, China: Kan and Chen, 2004) , indicating that the total economic cost of PM accounted for 4.31% and 1.03% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of Singapore and Shanghai, respectively. The present study evaluated the health impacts of PM 10 pollution in Beijing from 2000 to 2004 and estimated the economic costs. The results should provide a useful reference for pollution control policies.",

            "text": "Monitoring stations often measure several air pollutants, e.g. PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 . The variation in ambient concentrations of these pollutants may be dominated by atmospheric diffusion, so that levels of the different pollutants are correlated. To avoid overestimating health effects, K\u00fcnzli et al. (2000) derived estimates from a single indicator pollutant. Although fine particle (PM 2.5 ) pollution has a stronger association with adverse human health effects, it has not been measured in China. Researchers (Quah and Boon, 2003; Kan and Chen, 2004 ) therefore used PM 10 as an indicator. The annual PM 10 concentrations for [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] in Beijing were reported in the BJEPB annual reports (Table 1) , the data were averaged over seven urban substations. Consequently, the domain of the health effects being studied in the present study is the urban areas of Beijing. The high annual concentrations could have originated from several emission sources. The population of Beijing, both total and urban, continues to increase (Table 1; BMBS, 2005) . Coal remains a major energy source in Beijing; in 2003 nearly 27 million tons of coal provided more than 50% of the total energy consumption (BJEPB, 2003) . The Capital Steel Corporation, located west of urban Beijing, has the capacity to produce 6 million tons of steel each year. Sand storms frequently affect Beijing in the spring. Road dust is resuspended by shearing force as well as by the turbulent wakes of vehicles (Song et al., 2006) .",

Aunan and Pan (2004) provided exposure-response coefficients for China according to a meta-analysis, based on the review of the exposure-response function for health effects and PM pollution. The results were very close to those used in Kan and Chen (2004) , as both cited literatures were almost same. For long-time mortality, we acknowledge that the cohort studies were absent in China and the PM pollution level is much higher than that in Western countries. The meta-analysis results from short-time studies in Asia (almost from China and Korea) for PM 10 pollution on all-case mortality were similar with the studies in American and Europe (see Table 20 in HEI, 2004) . The relative risks could be transferred. Aunan and Pan (2004) also suggested that the estimates from US cohort studies may be used in China and the results be likely to be on the high side.

It represents an individual's willingness to pay (WTP) for a marginal reduction in the risk of dying. For the valuation of reduced morbidity, besides WTP, the cost of illness (COI) approach could also be used. COI measures the total cost of illness that is imposed on a society (Quah and Boon, 2003) . Because a survey of the economic cost of mortality and morbidity from air pollution was not available for China, the benefit transfer approach (BTA) was required. It uses the values of environmental loss of a project to estimate the values of a similar project, assuming that the latter project will have a similar impact (Quah and Boon, 2003; Kan and Chen, 2004) .",

Moreover, only the health endpoints that could be quantitatively valued were selected in this study. Some health endpoints, such as lung function changes, pain and suffering, and restricted activity days, which are known to be associated with PM pollution, were not included, as these data were not available or difficult to assess; in addition, while the outbreak of influenza and SARS could have been included in the raw data we collected, this would have led to the overestimation of health damages.

Coal is still a dominant energy source in Beijing, especially in industry for electricity generation (EGU). It could be an effective way to use the advanced coal gasification technologies in the coal-fired EGU. Raw coal used in industrial plants could be replaced by cleaner energy sources, such as natural gas or electric power. A remarkable problem is that the number of motor vehicles is increasing rapid from 1.5 million in 2000 to 2.4 million in 2004. Conversely, the bicycle use is declining. Beijing government should preserve or restore bicycle lanes and provide free parking facilities to encourage the bicycle use. On the other hand, both the control technologies on tailpipe emission and gasoline quality should be improved in motor vehicles. Reduction of gaseous pollutants, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides from tailpipe exhaust and sulfur dioxide from coal burning could alleviate the fine particles pollution transferred through photochemical reactions. As some toxic organics, such as black carbon could be still abundant in the fine part of road dust in Beijing (Song et al., 2006) , the bare soil surfaces should be grassed or wooded.",

The health impacts of PM pollution in 2002 may have been worse than in the other years because the PM concentration (166 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 ) and the population figures were highest at that time. Although the PM concentrations in 2000 and 2001 were close to those in 2002, generally, the health effects were less extreme than in 2002, because the population increased by about 759,000 people that year.",
