            "text": "Tylvalosin, a new broad-spectrum, third-generation macrolides, may exert a variety of pharmacological activities. Here, we report on its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages and mouse treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as piglet challenged with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Tylvalosin treatment markedly decreased IL-8, IL-6, IL-1b, PGE2, TNF-a and NO levels in vitro and in vivo. LPS and PRRSV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the lipid peroxidation in mice lung tissues reduced after tylvalosin treatments. In mouse acute lung injury model induced by LPS, tylvalosin administration significantly attenuated tissues injury, and reduced the inflammatory cells recruitment and activation. The evaluated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and the increased expressions of cPLA2-IVA, p-cPLA2-IVA and sPLA2-IVE were lowered by tylvalosin. Consistent with the mouse results, tylvalosin pretreatment attenuated piglet lung scores with improved growth performance and normal rectal temperature in piglet model induced by PRRSV. Furthermore, tylvalosin attenuated the IkBa phosphorylation and degradation, and blocked the NF-kB p65 translocation. These results indicate that in addition to its direct antimicrobial effect, tylvalosin exhibits anti-inflammatory property and attenuates acute lung injury through suppression of NF-kB activation.",

            "text": "complex process of development of ALI [5] . To date, the underlying mechanism of ALI remains elusive and no effective regimen is available. The only one treatment that definitely improves survival involves reducing the volume of air applied to the lungs during mechanical ventilation [1] . Thus, new strategies are still required for achieving effective treatment of ALI, which might ultimately aid the clinical therapy for patients with ALI/ARDS. ALI and ARDS are characterized by an intense pulmonary inflammatory response, involving polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) recruitment, interstitial edema, a disruption of epithelial integrity, and lung parenchymal injury [3] . The pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS involves disorders of oxidant/anti-oxidant and inflammation/anti-inflammation, the upregulation of adhesion molecules, and the increased production of chemokines [6, 7] . Activated PMNs contribute to lung injury by releasing inflammatory cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, ROS and other proinflammatory mediators which display key events in ALI and may represent a potential target for therapy. Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1b (IL-1b), IL-8, and IL-6, play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS by stimulating chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils [3, 9] . Pharmacotherapies aimed at blocking a specific cytokine, such as IL-1 or TNF-a, have been unsuccessful [10] , which suggest that a more global inhibition of cytokine signaling network may be required to impede lung injury. Therefore, it is very important to develop novel therapeutic approaches to modulating the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory response and restoring immune homeostasis. In addition, alveolar epithelial cell function and barrier integrity are crucial to preserve normal gas exchange, and injury or loss of epithelial cells may lead to progression of ALI/ARDS [3, 11] . In all, understanding of the mechanisms in the development of ALI/ ARDS is essential for developing novel therapeutic options to treat this syndrome.",

Therefore, different animal models of experimental lung injury have been developed. Mouse models of ALI could be established by intraperitoneal (i.p.), tracheal (i.t.) or intranasal (i.n.) instillation of LPS, ventilator, or smoking inhalation in mice. LPS is an important component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, which is often used to establish the experimental model of ALI [12] . ALI represents a state of excess production of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules [8] ; and the LPS is a major stimulus for release of these mediators, which may further cause pulmonary damage leading to ALI [3] . Although great advances in understanding the pathophysiology of ALI had been achieved, the available therapies have not reduced the mortality or increased the quality of life in survivors.",

            "text": "Although many studies focusing on the pathophysiology of ALI have been done in rodent, rodents are different from humans in many ways, especially with regard to lung anatomy and the behavior of inflammatory mediators or cytokines. Small animal models, though useful for large-scale economical screening of new methods, have limitations and may not be directly relevant to clinical conditions. However, larger animals are more useful for detailed studies over a longer period and are essential before clinical trials can be performed [13] . Compared with other species, pigs and humans show remarkable anatomical, physiological and immunologically similarity [14] , which are useful experimental animals to study ALI. Humans share the same symptoms as pigs, including fever, metabolic dysfunctions, systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, vascular leakage resulting in lung edema, and increased proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1b and TNF-a [15] . Likewise, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and similar end-organ failure are observed in the pig and in humans. Also, pigs are gentle, easy to feed, and show higher survival rates. Domestic pigs have a significantly lower cost in China. These facts support the idea that the pig can serve as an excellent animal model to study the pathogenesis of ALI or ARDS. In addition, the pig has attracted attention as a valuable preclinical model for medical research. PRRSV is a member of the family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales, that replicates in lung alveolar macrophages and induces several cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-a involving pulmonary inflammation response [16, 17] , producing an influenza-like illness associated with respiratory distress [18] in young piglets. Therefore, PRRSV-induced respiratory distress in piglet may be a novel and safe animal model to study ALI, since this virus is not a zoonotic pathogen unlike SARS-CoV or H5N1.",

In unstimulated cells, NF-kB is localized to the cytosol due to its binding with IkB. Once activated by LPS, IkB is phosphorylated by IkB kinase and degraded, and then the released NF-kB is translocated into the nucleus [23] . Therefore, the activation of NF-kB was assessed in RAW264.7 cells by measuring the degree of phosphorylation of IkBa protein and NF-kB p65 translocation. Treatment with LPS resulted in the degradation of IkBa and this degradation was significantly blocked by tylvalosin ( Fig. 10A and  B) . To determine whether this IkBa degradation was related to IkBa phosphorylation, we examined the effect of tylvalosin on LPS-induced p-IkBa by western blot. The results showed that the phosphorylation of IkBa in RAW264.7 cells increased after LPS administration but was significantly inhibited by tylvalosin in a concentration dependent manner ( Fig. 10A and B) . To gain further insight into the mechanism of tylvalosin-mediated regulation of NF-kB, we examined the effect of tylvalosin on NF-kB p65 nuclear translocation. As shown in Fig. 10C and D, LPS-treated cells showed a notably increased nuclear protein level and a decreased cytoplasmic protein level, compared to PBS-treated RAW264.7 cells, tylvalosin treatment significantly attenuated these alterations in a dose-dependent manner ( * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01).",

The results demonstrated that tylvalosin inhibited secretion of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b, IL-8, PGE2 and NO in a dose dependent manner (Figs. 2 and 3) . Tylvalosin and tilmicosin are semi-synthesized compounds derived from tylosin, belonging to 16-membered macrolides. Consistent with the previous study [24] , the present study also shown that tilmicosin significantly decreased the production of )) Twenty-four hours after LPS injection, LPS mice continued to have more severe lung and liver injury than tylvalosin ( ** P < 0.01 for 50 and 100 mg/kg) treated mice. Original magnification 200\u00c2. (E) LPS treatment mice had more severe lung and liver injury histological scores at both 4 and 24 h, based on hemorrhage, interstitial edema, inflammatory cells infiltration and hepatocyte degeneration, apoptosis and necrosis. Total BALF protein concentration (F) and wet:dry ratio (G) were increased in LPS mice after i.p. LPS when compared with ctrl mice and tylvalosin treatment mice (n = 10 each group, replicated 3 times for histology, wet:dry, BALF protein, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01; histological scores were from three mice per group, three lobes examined per mouse). TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b, PGE2, and NO. Taken together with our findings reported here, this suggests that like the 14-and 15-member macrolides, the 16-member macrolides also have anti-inflammatory activity apart from their antibacterial activity. As to the production of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b, IL-8 and PGE2, there is no difference between tylvalosin and tilmicosin treatment. This result indicated that the anti-inflammatory activity depended on their parent ring (lactone ring) (Fig. 1 ) and seemed to have nothing to do with their side chain modification. However, tylvalosin even in the lower concentration showed higher inhibition effect of NO release comparable to that of tilmicosin. This difference could be attributed to tylvalosin side chain modification with 3-O-acetyl-4 0 -O-isovaleryl. Furthermore, tylvalosin exhibits rapid entry and accumulation than tilmicosin [19] . Tylvalosin is rapidly metabolized with 50% being metabolized within 30 min. The main metabolite is 3-O-acetyltylosin, which possesses equivalent activity to the parent compound. The information gained from this study could be very useful for the further design and development of novel macrolides.",

The predominant inflammatory cells are neutrophils, which play an important role in the development of most cases of ALI [3] , and may represent a potential target for therapy. Consequently, we address the effect of tylvalosin treatment on ALI and on neutrophil effector functions. In addition to the involvement of the neutrophils, macrophages are known to play a crucial role in LPS-induced ALI [25] . In this study, mice exposed to LPS exhibited a massive recruitment of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 6) . In contrast, pre-treatment with tylvalosin inhibited the increase in the number of total cells, neutrophils, and macrophages in the BALF. In addition, the lung histological examination (Fig. 5) above also supported this finding. The infiltration of proinflammatory cells, hemorrhage, formation of hyaline membranes, alveolar edema, and airway epithelial necrosis were found to be common and prominent in the LPS group but rare in the tylvalosin (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.g.) treatment groups. These results suggested that the protective effect of tylvalosin on ALI was related to an attenuation of inflammatory cell sequestration and migration into the lung tissue. Neutrophil recruitment in the lung involves in a cascade-like fashion of activation, intravascular accumulation and transendothelial and transepithelial migration, where different adhesion molecules and chemokines are involved in neutrophil recruitment. Therefore, the detailed mechanism for the tylvalosin inhibition activity on neutrophil recruitment and activation needs further study.",

In line with these concepts, we found that mice challenged with LPS expressed very large amounts of these proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF compared with the negative control group (Figs. 2 and 3) . In contrast, tylvalosin pre-treatment was found to downregulate TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 secretion at 4 and 24 h after LPS challenge ( Figs. 2 and 3) . We believe that the tylvalosin could suppress the early and later stage of the lung inflammation. These results suggest that the protective effects of tylvalosin on LPS-induced ALI are in part attributed to inhibition of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6. IL-8 (CXCL8) is a member of the CXC chemokine family, which is secreted by variety of cell types in inflammation, associated with the development and outcome of ALI/ARDS [27] . Thus, preventing the overproduction of IL-8 may attenuate lung inflammation. In this study, we found that pretreated with 50 and 100 mg/kg of tylvalosin, the IL-8 level was significantly decreased. Thus, tylvalosin has the potential for utilization in ALI.",

Thus, the reduction in NO production has been suggested as an effective strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. In this study, we shown that tylvalosin suppressed LPS dependent secretion of NO in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2) , and exhibited anti-inflammatory property, although the detailed mechanism unknown.

The present study shown that the release of PGE2 was stimulated by LPS and this effect was attenuated by tylvalosin (Fig. 2) . PGE2 is the most widely produced prostanoid and contributes to fever, pain and swelling during inflammation [29] . Since tilmicosin and tylosin decreased the production of PGE2 through downregulating COX-2 gene expression in vitro [24] , this modulation of tylvalosin might be associated with similar effect. On the contrary, Lakritz et al. demonstrated that tilmicosin in vitro appears to reduce PGE2 production in LPSstimulated bovine alveolar macrophages without altering COX-2 mRNA expression [30] . Therefore, unexplored regulatory mechanism for this enzyme needs to be addressed. It has been suggested that immediate production of PGE2 is mediated by cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), and delayed production is mediated by secretory phospholipase A2-IIA (sPLA2-IIA) [31] . We hypothesized that the immunomodulating effects of tylvalosin contribute to ameliorate ALI by suppression of PLA2. It has been well established that the PLA2 is an important factor in lung diseases that involve inflammation [32] . Since this enzyme represents a family of over 30 distinct proteins with various structural and biochemical characteristics, determining the particular role of PLA2 in the setting of lung inflammation has proven quite challenging [38] . Until recently, the relationship between the role of PLA2 and the immunoregulatory effect of tylvalosin has not been elucidated.",

However, there is no expression difference between Ctrl and ALI mice, in spite of treatment or not. Furthermore, the other studies have shown that iPLA2-VI activity in rat is unchanged with low-dose LPS infusion [34] . Thus, no evidence exists in support of a role of iPLA2-VI in ALI. It has to be pointed out that iPLA2-VIB is suggested to participate in the regulation of sPLA2-IIA expression induced by inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin [35] .cPLA2s consist of six known isoforms in mammals. Among cPLA2 isoforms, cPLA2-IVA contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammation diseases [36] and has attracted attention as a target for controlling eicosanoid related inflammation. The current study was initiated to examine the potential utility of cPLA2-IVA expression as an intermediate biomarker in ALI chemoprevention trials. To this end, we examined the expression of cPLA2-IVA enzyme in the lungs from normal and LPS challenge mice treated with tylvalosin or not. As expected, cPLA2-IVA was overexpressed in the epithelial bronchial cells, subbronchial epithelial cells and in leukocytes after LPS challenge. However, tylvalosin (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.g.) treatment significantly downregulated this effect stimulated by LPS in a dosedependent manner, followed by ALI attenuation. Thus the results of the present work put forward an enzyme (cPLA2-IVA) targeted ALI therapy in future. Cytokines and oxidative stress are also capable of inducing cPLA2 expression in lung epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle cells, and lung fibroblasts [36] . Consequently, the cPLA2-IVA downexpression might be related with tylvalosin immunomodulation on the production of cytokines and ROS discussed above. In addition, the data that tylvalosin suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory cells recruitment and activation in mouse model also supported our conclusion, since cPLA2 plays a major role in neutrophil function in inflammatory and infectious disease clinical settings [37] .cPLA2 is synthesized within the cytosol in the form of inactive enzyme and when activated, translocates to the membranes of golgi, endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope in a calcium-dependent manner. Phosphorylation activation of cPLA2 on three serine residues Ser505, Ser515, and Ser727 significantly enhances its activity and represents a mechanism by which the cell regulates this enzyme's function. In this study, cPLA2-IVA phosphorylation was examined with IHC staining. As expected, LPS induced cPLA2-IVA phosphorylation, and p-cPLA2-IVA was mainly overexpressed in the epithelial bronchial cells and subbronchial epithelial cells. However, tylvalosin (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.g.) treatment significantly downregulated this phosphorylation activation in a dosedependent manner, followed by ALI attenuation. Thus, the inhibition of cPLA2 activation may be one of the crucial protective mechanisms of tylvalosin in LPS-induced ALI. In all, inhibition of cPLA2 expression, activation and activity may diminish the formation of inflammatory mediators, resulting in reduced inflammatory manifestations, and may regulate the release of oxygen radicals that also participate in endothelial damage. Thus, this type of PLA2 may be a suitable target enzyme for the development of inhibitory therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory disorders including ALI.",

            "text": "Accumulating evidences have indicated that some sPLA2s work in concert with cPLA2 to induce eicosanoid formation in different mammalian cells [38] . Many of sPLA2 isoforms are expressed in lung play significant roles in human inflammatory lung diseases such as ALI/ARDS, and in these conditions, elevated amounts of sPLA2 are found in the BALF and lung tissue, which seem a promising therapeutic target. Furthermore, our present study indicated that the increased expression of sPLA2-IVE colocalizes with areas of intense inflammation, and there exists a positive correlation between increased levels of sPLA2 and a poor clinical outcome. sPLA2-IVE, also known as cPLA2-e, has been cloned from mouse tissues; however, only preliminary information is available about their biochemical properties, and nothing is known of their functional roles. Our IHC analysis further showed that it was expressed the epithelial bronchial cells, in inflammatory cells in subbronchial epithelial, and in leukocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the sPLA2-IVE expression pattern in mouse lung during ALI. The expression of sPLA2-IVE was significantly increased in the lung after LPS challenge, however, the mechanism(s) by which it increases remains unclear. Instead, tylvalosin (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.g.) treatment reversed this effect significantly. The exact role of these enzymes have not been elucidated. A better understanding of the regulation of sPLA2s levels in the plasma and BALF under normal circumstances and during ALI/ARDS will bring about superior strategies for therapeutic intervention. The involvement of sPLA2s in ALI has lead to the development of novel prodrug and liposome based drug delivery systems that are specifically activated or degraded by sPLA2s in the diseased tissue, causing a site-specific release of the associated or encapsulated drugs. The converse strategy of preventing sPLA2 activity with concomitant AA and eicosanoid generation has also been attracted attention. Conclusively, though the mechanism is obscure, the decreased activity of PLA2, the downregulation of cPLA2-IVA and sPLA2-IV expressions as well as cPLA2-IVA activation in the lung might be one of the clues to understand the anti-inflammatory property of tylvalosin. This fact points to the PLA2 family as a potential therapeutic target for ALI.",

In agreement with the results from mice study, tylvalosin treatment attenuated piglet lung scores. In addition, PRRSV strain Hn challenge had a significant impact on BW gain, and the impact became more apparent when inspected over the longer time period after infection until 21 days p.i. (Fig. 9 ). In contrast, tylvalosin treatment reversed body weight drop. In this model, PRRSV challenge caused long-lasting high fever in piglet (Fig. 9) , and the downmodulation of tylvalosin on rectal temperature after challenge was found. In our white Leghorns (28day-old) fever model induced by LPS (5 mg/kg, i.p.), tylvalosin also restrained body temperature closer to normal (data not shown). These results indicate that tylvalosin seems to exhibit extensive thermoregulation in vivo. The pathogenic consequences and immunological responses of piglets to PRRSV are directly related to viral load in acute infection as reflected in viral titers in blood [40] . In the present study, tylvalosin treatment significantly reduced viral load, which might be due to its antiviral effect and rapid absorption and wide distribution properties in the tissues. These data indicate that PRRSV-induced piglet model can be used to study ALI and evaluate medicates efficacy.",

The NF-kB pathway has been considered to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of LPS-induced ALI and PRRSV as discussed above. The heterodimers of NF-kB components, which are mostly p50/p65, are normally retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form through being associated with an inhibitor of kB (IkB) protein [23, 37] . A wide variety of stimuli can cause the phosphorylation of IkB, a process that is followed by the protein's ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. The phosphorylation induced degradation of the IkB inhibitor enables the NF-kB dimers to enter the nucleus and activate specific target gene expression [23, 37] . In this study, we observed the inhibitory effects of tylvalosin on the LPS-induced NF-kB activation shown as western blot and immunohistochemical results (Figs. 10 and 11) . It is reported that LPS stimulates production of reactive oxygen, elevation of PLA2s enzyme activity and activation of redoxsensitive signaling cascades including NF-kB, and then triggers elevated expression of pro-inflammatory mediators leading to acute lung injury. Our results suggested that tylvalosin reduced LPS-induced inflammation probably via inactivation of ROS and blunting the redox-sensitive inflammatory signaling NF-kB. Since NF-kB pathway plays a central role in PRRSV pathogenesis, the underlying protective mechanisms of tylvalosin in piglet is presumably the case.",

Tylvalosin attenuated LPS-induced inflammation and lung injury, including reduction of lung W/D ratio, inhibition of protein level, MPO expression and activity, and inflammatory cells aggregation in BALF. Histological examination showed that tylvalosin significantly ameliorated tissues injury with improved lung and liver morphology. Tylvalosin treatment reduced the production of proinflammatory mediators induced by LPS, the production of ROS induced by LPS and PRRSV, and the PLA2 enzyme activity. The degree of immunohistochemical staining for the cPLA2-IVA, p-cPLA2-IVA, and sPLA2-IVE was significantly reduced by tylvalosin pretreatment. Our results imply a potential role for PLA2 in the management of ALI. Furthermore, we demonstrated that tylvalosin inhibited NF-kB activation in LPS-induced ALI. In piglet model, administration of tylvalosin reversed the fluctuation of rectal temperatures to normal level, improved growth performance and reduced lung scores, which might be involved in its antiviral effect as well as the inhibition of NF-kB activation and ROS production. Therefore, tylvalosin may be considered as a potential agent for preventing ALI in the future. Also, further and comprehensive studies are needed before clinical application.",
