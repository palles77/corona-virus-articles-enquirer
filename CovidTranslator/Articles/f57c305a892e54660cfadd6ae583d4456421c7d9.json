Increasingly, surveillance systems are capturing spatial and temporal data on disease and health outcomes in a variety of public health contexts. A vast and growing suite of methods exists for detection of outbreaks and trends in surveillance data and the selection of appropriate methods in a given surveillance context is not always clear. While most reviews of methods focus on algorithm performance, in practice, a variety of factors determine what methods are appropriate for surveillance. In this review, we focus on the role of contextual factors such as scale, scope, surveillance objective, disease characteristics, and technical issues in relation to commonly used approaches to surveillance. Methods are classified as testing-based or model-based approaches. Reviewing methods in the context of factors other than algorithm performance highlights important aspects of implementing and selecting appropriate disease surveillance methods.",

Surveillance systems serve a variety of public health functions (e.g., outbreak detection, control planning) by integrating data representing human and/or animal health with statistical methods (Diggle, 2003) , visualization tools (Moore et al., 2008) , and increasingly, linkage with other geographic datasets within a GIS (Odiit et al., 2006) .",

Outbreak detection is the intended function of many surveillance systems. In syndromic surveillance systems, early-warning signals are provided by analysis of pre-diagnostic data that may be indicative of people's care-seeking behaviour during the early stages of an outbreak. In contrast, systems designed to monitor food and water-borne (e.g., cholera) pathogens are designed for case detection, where one case may trigger a response from public health workers. Similarly, where eradication of a disease in an area is a public health objective, surveillance may be designed primarily for case detection. Alternatively, where a target disease is endemic to an area, perhaps with seasonal variation in incidence, such as rabies, monitoring space-time trends may be the primary surveillance objective (Childs et al., 2000) .",

Following the 2001 bioterrorism attacks in the United States, there was expanded interest and funding for the development of electronic surveillance networks capable of detecting a bioterrorist attack. Many of these were designed to monitor data that precede diagnoses of a disease (i.e., syndromic surveillance). By May 2003 there were an estimated 100 syndromic surveillance systems in development throughout the US (Buehler et al., 2003) . Due to the noisy nature of syndromic data, these systems rely heavily on advanced statistical methods for anomaly detection. As data being monitored in syndromic systems precede diagnoses they contain a signal that is further removed from the pathogen than traditional disease surveillance, so in addition to having potential for early warning, there is also greater risk of false alarms (i.e., mistakenly signaling an outbreak) (Stoto et al., 2004) .",

Data sources used in BioSense include Veterinary Affairs and Department of Defense facilities, private hospitals, national laboratories, and state surveillance and healthcare systems. The broad mandate and national scope of the system necessitated the use of general statistical methods insensitive to widely varying types, quality, consistency and volume of data. Two methods used in BioSense are a generalized linear mixed-model which estimates counts of syndrome cases based on location, day of the week and effects due to seasonal variation and holidays. Counts are estimated weekly for each syndrome-location combination. A second temporal surveillance approach computed for each syndrome under surveillance is a cumulative sum of counts where events are flagged as unusual if the observed count is two standard deviations above the moving average. The selection of surveillance methods in BioSense considered factors associated with heterogeneity of data sources and data volume among others.",

Algorithm performance is usually measured by sensitivity, specificity and timeliness. Sensitivity is the probability of an alarm given an outbreak, and specificity is the probability of no alarm when there is no outbreak. Timeliness is measured in number of time units to detection, and has been a focus of systems developed for early outbreak detection (Wagner et al., 2001) . The importance of each of these measures of performance need to be evaluated in light of the system's contextual factors outlined in Table 1 . Our goal in this review of approaches to space-time disease surveillance is to synthesize major surveillance methods in a way that will focus on the feasibility of implementation and highlight contrasts between different methods. First, we aim to place methods in the context of some key aspects of practical implementation. Second, we aim to highlight how methods of space-time disease surveillance relate to different surveillance contexts. Disease surveillance serves a number of public health functions under varying scenarios and methods need to be tailored and suited to particular contexts. Finally, we provide guidance to public health practitioners in understanding methods of space-time disease surveillance. We limit our focus to methods that use data encoded with both spatial and temporal information.",

Most methods assume a study area made up of smaller, nonoverlapping sub-regions where cases of disease are being monitored. The variable under surveillance is the count of the number of cases. In retrospective analysis, the data are fixed and methods are used to determine whether an outbreak occurred during the study period, or characterize the spatial-temporal trends in disease over the course of the study period (Marshall, 1991) . In the prospective scenario, the objective is to determine whether any single sub-region or collection of sub-regions is undergoing an outbreak (currently), and analysis occurs in an automated, sequential fashion as data accumulate over time. Prospective methods require special consideration as data do not form a fixed sample from which to make inferences about (Sonesson and Bock, 2003) . Parallel surveillance methodologies compute a test statistic separately for each sub-region and signal an alarm if any of sub-regions are significantly anomalous (Fig. 1A) . While in vector accumulation methods, test statistics in a parallel surveillance setting are combined to form one general alarm statistic (Fig. 1B) . Conversely, a scalar accumulation approach com-putes one statistic over all sub-regions for each time period (Frisen and Sonesson, 2005) (Fig. 1C ). For example, Rogerson (1997) used the Tango (1995) statistic to monitor changes in spatial point patterns.",

Thus, this class of methods is designed to detect clusters of disease in space and time, and suit surveillance systems designed for outbreak detection. Most spatial cluster detection methods such as the Geographical Analysis Machine (Openshaw et al., 1987) , density estimation (Bithell, 1990; Lawson and Williams, 1993 ), Turnbull's method (Turnbull et al., 1990) , the Besag and Newell (1991) test, spatial autocorrelation methods such as the Gi * (Getis and Ord, 1992) , and LISAs (Anselin, 1995) , and the spatial scan statistic (Kulldorff and Nagarwalla, 1995) are types of statistical tests. The development of methods for space-time cluster detection naturally evolved from these purely spatial methods. We can stratify methods in the statistical test class into three types: tests for space-time interaction, cumulative sum methods, and scan statistics.",

The Knox test (1964) uses a simple test statistic which is the number of case pairs close both in space and in time. This count is compared to the null expectation conditional on the number of pairs close only in space, and the number of pairs close only in time; i.e., the times of occurrence of the cases are independent of case location. A major shortcoming of the Knox (1964) method is that the definition of ''closeness\" is arbitrary. Mantel's (1967) test addresses this by summing across all possible space-time pairs, while Diggle et al. (1995) identify clustering at discrete distance bands in the space-time K function. For infectious diseases, it is likely that near space-time pairs are of greater importance, so Mantel suggests a reciprocal transformation such that distant pairs are weighted less than near pairs. The Mantel test can in fact be used to test for association between any two distance matrices, and is often used by ecologists to test for interaction between space and another distance variable such as genetic similarity (Legendre and Fortin, 1989) .",

Here, the test statistic is defined by the number of case pairs that are k nearest neighbours in both space and time. When space-time interaction is present, the test statistic is large.

For a point pattern of cases of disease, compute the spatial statistic, and use this value of the statistic to condition the expected value at the next time period.

The spatial approach looks for clusters by scanning over a map of cases of disease using circular search areas of varying radii. Kulldorff and Nagarwalla (1995) refined spatial scanning with the development of the spatial scan statistic which adjusts for the multiple testing of many circular search areas. The spatial scan statistic overcomes the multiple-testing problem (common to many local spatial analysis methods) by taking the most likely cluster defined by maximizing the likelihood that the cases within the search area are part of a cluster compared to the rest of the study area.

In long term space-time surveillance scenarios, accurate population estimates between decennial censuses are rare or must be interpolated. In syndromic applications, where cases are affected by unknown variations in care-seeking behaviours, the raw population numbers may not accurately reflect the at-risk population. In Kulldorff et al. (2005) , the expected value for each unit under surveillance is estimated from historical case data rather than population data.

Space-time scan statistics are able to detect and locate clusters of disease, and can condition expected counts for individual sub-regions on population data or on previous case data, making these methods suitable for implementation where data volume is large. The scope of scan statistics, like most statistical tests, is limited to monitoring case data, either case event point data or counts by sub-region. Scan statistics are best served to detect and locate discrete localized outbreaks. Secondary clusters can be identified by ranking candidate clusters by their likelihood ratio. Yet region-wide outbreaks cannot be detected with scan-statistics because of the assumed form of a cluster as a compact geographical region where cases are greater than expected. Novel space-time methods that search for raised incidence via graph-based connectivity may model spatial relationships of disease processes more accurately than circular search areas. However, the computational burden and complexity of these approaches limits their use to expert analysts and researchers. At the root of the problem is a conceptual discrepancy between the definition of a disease outbreak (which disease surveillance systems are often interested in detecting) and a disease cluster (defined by spatial proximity) which is common to all statistical testing methods for space-time surveillance (Lawson, 2005) .",

A second impetus for the development of statistical models for disease surveillance is that a large part of epidemiology concerned with estimating relationships between environmental variables and disease risk (i.e., ecological analysis) provided a methodological basis from which to draw. Modelling for space-time disease surveillance is relatively recent, and this is a very active area of statistical surveillance research.

Particularly, relaxation of distributional assumptions, flexibility in link functions, and the ability to model spatial relationships (at multiple spatial scales) as random effects make GLMM useful for prospec-tive space-time disease surveillance. The scale and scope of the surveillance context does not limit a model-based approach, and models may be even more useful when data abnormalities such as time lags occur (as estimates can be based on covariates alone). One feature of GLMM that are important for many disease surveillance contexts are the ease with which spatial hierarchies can be incorporated. Ecological relationships that are structured hierarchically that impact disease emergence (e.g., climate, vegetation, vector life-cycle development) can be represented and accounted for. Further, human drivers of disease emergence (e.g., land-use policies, travel patterns, demographics) are often organized hierarchically through administrative units. In social sciences GLMMs are often used (i.e., multi-level models) that incorporate these 'contextual effects' on an outcome variable. A further advantage of GLMMs is their ability to incorporate spatial variation in the underlying population at risk by conditioning the expected value on the random effect component (b i in Eq. (3)). Where fewer people are present, the expected value is adjusted toward the mean. This can somewhat account for the small-numbers problem of SMRs in epidemiology, reducing the likelihood of estimating extremely low expected values in rural areas.",

Analysis of disease in a Bayesian framework centers around inference on unknown area-specific relative risks. Inference on this unknown risk distribution is based on the observed data y and a prior distribution. These are combined via a likelihood function to create a distribution for model parameters which can be sampled for prediction. Bayesian models have been applied for retrospective space-time surveillance (e.g., MacNab, 2003) and are now being developed for prospective space-time disease surveillance. The basic Bayesian model can incorporate space and time dependencies. In Abellan et al. (2008) a model is described where the counts of disease are taken to be binomial distributed, and the next level of the model is composed of a decomposition of the unknown risks into model parameters for general risk, spatial effects, temporal effects, and space-time interaction. Estimation requires specifying prior distributions for each of the model components and sampling the posterior distribution via Monte Carlo markov chain (MCMC) methods. Here, the authors describe space-time Bayesian models for explanation of overall patterns of disease, speculating on their use in disease surveillance contexts. Rodeiro and Lawson (2006a) offer a similar model based on a Poisson distributed disease count. Specifically, the counts y i are Poisson with mean a function of the expected number of cases e ij in location i at time j and the area-specific relative risk rr ij .",

Bayesian models are attractive because they allow expert and local knowledge of disease processes to be incorporated via the specification of prior distributions on model parameters. However, this can also be a drawback, as a subjective element is introduced to the model. It is generally recommended that sensitivity analysis be conducted on a variety of candidate priors for model parameters (e.g., MacNab and Gustafson, 2007; MacNab, 2007a) . These technical aspects of model-fitting require advanced statistical training. A further complexity of Bayesian models is estimation. MCMC methods are required for generating the posterior distributions for these types of models and are computationally very demanding (although see Rodeiro and Lawson, 2006b) . This might negate the use of these approaches in surveillance contexts that require daily refitting of models (i.e., fine temporal resolution), however, monthly or annual model refitting may be possible. As with GLMMs, Bayesian models lend themselves to modelling hierarchical spatial relationships, and this can be important for both ecological and humanmediated drivers of disease emergence.",

This is similar in spirit to Rogerson's work (Rogerson, 1997) monitoring point patterns with spatial statistics, though here a specific underlying process is assumed: the Ising model. The Ising model represents a binary-state two dimensional lattice (sites coded 0 or 1). There are two parameters for the Ising model; one governs the overall intensity (probability of a site being a 1), and another the spatial interaction (probability of nearby sites being alike). In J\u00e4rpe (1999) , the intensity parameter is assumed equal and unchanging, and the surveillance is performed on the interaction parameter under different lattice sizes and types of change. The interaction parameter is essentially a global measure of spatial autocorrelation. This can then be monitored using temporal surveillance statistics such as CUSUM. Since the properties of the underlying model are known, J\u00e4rpe is able to detect very small changes in spatial autocorrelation which could indicate the shift of a disease from endemic to epidemic. While significant spatial autocorrelation is often present at both endemic and epidemic states, changes in clustering can reveal threshold dynamics of the process in a surveillance setting. This is a common feature of forest insect epidemics (Peltonen et al., 2002) . Further, the effect of the lattice size can easily be estimated, and as lattice size is increased, sensitivity to changes in the interaction parameter increases as well.",

For example, square lattices are used for remotely sensed image processing, and surveillance of the presence or absence of a disease in these sampling units using an Ising modelbased approach could incorporate remotely sensed environmental covariates (e.g., normalized differential wetness index) as is commonly done for zoonotic disease risk mapping and forecasting (Kitron et al., 1996; Rogers et al., 1996; Wilson, 2002) . However, it is unclear how covariates are included in the Ising model. This highlights an important point with model-based approaches to prospective surveillance: the main advantage of models is to incorporate extra information and to estimate smooth relative risks, yet as models grow in complexity they become more difficult to re-fit. This has implications for how suitable models are in different surveillance contexts. Where the temporal scale is large, expected counts can be based on observed data rather than using census or other data sources. This is particularly important where diseases follow seasonal trends. With limited temporal data available, estimating model parameters may make be impacted by regular variation in disease occurrence. For surveillance systems monitoring many small areas (i.e., large spatial scale), the Held et al. (2005) model would be of limited value as separate parameters need to be estimated for every sampling unit. Broad scale patterns over large areas might better captured by the point process approach of Diggle et al. (2005) . Although here, case event data with fine spatial resolution is required.",

This limits the applicability of modelling approaches to advanced analysts and researchers except for use in a black-box sense by analysts and public health practitioners. Surveillance models can be tailored to detect specific types of disease process changes, such as a regionwide increase, or small changes in spatial autocorrelation suggesting a shift from endemic to epidemic states. However, models also required additional tests to determine if incoming data differ from the expected (i.e., modelled) pattern of cases. Thus, in practice surveillance models are best utilized to estimate a realistic relative risk, and can then be combined with statistical tests such as CUSUM (J\u00e4rpe, 1999) and scan statistics .",

One problem for most methods of surveillance, is the specification of the null hypothesis, or expected disease prevalence. While expected rates are generally conditional on population data, spatial heterogeneity in the background rates are rarely accounted for. That is, complete spatial randomness (CSR) is the underlying null model. Goovaerts and Jacquez (2004) have used geostatistical approaches, estimating spatial dependence of background rates via the semivariogram, to develop more realistic null models for disease cluster detection. The geostatistical framework has the advantage of estimating spatial dependence from the data, rather than defining it a priori via a spatial weights matrix as is common in disease mapping models.",

Unusual clusters on the map imply heightened risk is associated with those locations. However, movement of animals and people decouples the location of diagnosis from disease risk by modifying exposure histories. Methods that account for mobility may be an important area for future surveillance, especially in the context of real-time, prospective outbreak detection. The relationship between case, location, and exposure is further complicated by disease latency periods, which gives rise to space-time lags in diagnoses (Schaerstrom, 1999) . This may be most important in the context of retrospective cluster analysis and investigation of possible environmental risk factors. Statistical tests have been developed to account for exposure history and mobility for case-control data (Jacquez and Meliker, 2009 ) and case-only data (Jacquez et al., 2007) . Kernel-based approaches to risk estimation that incorporate duration at each location have been utilized for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Sabel et al., 2003) . The general approach is to model and analyze the space-time path of individuals in the sense of H\u00e4gerstrand (1967) . As personal location data continues to become ubiquitous due to new technology such as GPS-enabled cell phones, surveillance methods that account for individual space-time histories may see more application in public health surveillance.",

Spatial effects (i.e., clustering) are likely only of interest when cases/counts collected over a relatively large, heterogeneous area are being analyzed. Over smaller more homogeneous areas, where spatial effects are negligible, temporal surveillance is optimal. When space-time surveillance is warranted, choice of which surveillance approach to use may be impacted by how spatial effects can be incorporated. Where spatial scale is small, one would likely focus on either process models or statistical tests which use an underlying distribution for the null hypothesis (i.e., Poisson model). The temporal scale of surveillance is also important. Large temporal scales can use either testing or modelling methods, and most suit methods where baselines are estimated from previous cases, such as with the space-time permutation scan statistic. Short temporal scales are not appropriate for models when diseases have complex day of the week effects or seasonal variation in incidence. Scale will also affect the computational burden placed on the system. Many approaches reviewed here, particularly statistical tests such as scan statistics, use approximate randomization to generate a distribution of a test statistic under the null hypothesis. Methods that utilize randomization procedures, while powerful, impose constraints when applied with large spatial-temporal datasets.",

As zoonotic diseases make up the majority of emerging infectious diseases (Greger, 2007) , multiple host surveillance methods are required. Multivariate tests such as multivariate CUSUM can be used to monitor multiple signals. Modelling approaches can also be used by creating a generalized risk index as the variable under surveillance.

However, for epidemiologists already familiar with generalized linear mixed models, some model approaches that incorporated space and time may be quickly attainable, such as that of Kleinman et al. (2004) . Yet for analysts from a health geography or spatial analysis background, testing methods might be more familiar.
