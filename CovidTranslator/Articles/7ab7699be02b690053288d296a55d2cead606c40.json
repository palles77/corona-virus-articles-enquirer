Of all the potential drug targets, the helicase of CoVs is considered to be one of the most important. Here, we first present the structure of the full-length Nsp13 helicase of SARS-CoV (SARS-Nsp13) and investigate the structural coordination of its five domains and how these contribute to its translocation and unwinding activity. A translocation model is proposed for the Upf1like helicase members according to three different structural conditions in solution characterized through H/D exchange assay, including substrate state (SARS-Nsp13-dsDNA bound with AMPPNP), transition state (bound with ADP-AlF 4 \u2212 ) and product state (bound with ADP). We observed that the \u242419-\u242420 loop on the 1A domain is involved in unwinding process directly. Furthermore, we have shown that the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), SARS-Nsp12, can enhance the helicase activity of SARS-Nsp13 through interacting with it directly. The interacting regions were identified and can be considered common across CoVs, which provides new insights into the Replication and Transcription Complex (RTC) of CoVs.",

A decade later, a similar coronavirus termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged, but alarmingly this virus has higher case-fatality rates than SARS-CoV. Thus, there is a refocussing of the world's attention onto CoVs. The fact that no therapeutic treatments are available for CoVs is a serious concern (1,2). It is therefore necessary to study the life cycle of CoVs to develop new ideas for effective vaccines or drugs.",

Importantly, SARS-Nsp13 has been identified as an ideal target for the development of anti-viral drugs due to its sequence conservation and indispensability across all CoV species (5) (6) (7) . SARS-Nsp13 has been characterized as belonging to superfamily 1 (SF1) of the six helicase superfamilies which are classified on the basis of several conserved motifs and can unwind both RNA and DNA duplexes in the 5 to 3 direction (8) . The associated NTPase activity can target all natural nucleotides and deoxynucleotides as substrates (9, 10) . Moreover, it has been shown that SARS-Nsp12 can enhance the helicase activity of SARS-Nsp13 by increasing the step size of nucleic acid (dsRNA or dsDNA) unwinding by 2-fold (11) . However, how the SARS-Nsp12 increase its helicase activity and if the NTPase activity is also influenced remains unclear.",

SARS-CoV Nsp13 is also a Upf1-like helicase. However, until recently when the MERS-CoV Nsp13 was solved, no structural information for this coronavirus helicase was available despite biochemical characterization and the determination of kinetic parameters associated with its helicase or NTPase activity (14) . The structure of MERS-CoV helicase in the absence of nucleotide and substrate was reported to have four domains, an N-terminal CH domain, two helicase core domains RecA1 and RecA2 and an inserted domain 1B. In addition, there is a 'stalk' region which connects the CH domain and 1B domain. However, how the five domains cooperate to contribute to the helicase function remains undefined.",

Helicases have been characterized as translocases as the unwinding activity can be the result of it translocating on singlestranded oligonucleotides (15) . We demonstrate how the 1A and 2A domains coordinate with each other when SARS-Nsp13 translocates on ssDNA through observing the H/D exchanges conditions of three states of SARS-Nsp13 with different ligands bound including ATP analog (AMPPNP), ADP-AlF4 \u2212 and ADP.

BL21(DE3) cells were then transformed by introduction of this plasmid. After enlarging the reproduction volume of competent cells, the target gene was overexpressed. Cells were grown at 37 \u2022 C and induced with 200 M IPTG when the OD value reached \u223c0.8. Thereafter, the induced cells were transferred to 18 \u2022 C to grow for 12-16 h. Cells were harvested at 4500 rpm by centrifugation at 4 \u2022 C. After ultrasonification and centrifugation at 14 000 rpm, the supernatant was run through a Ni-affinity column and the protein eluted with 200 mM imidazole. The eluate was then further purified by ion exchange column Hitrap S and sizeexclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare).",

All the mutants exhibited binding deficiency except for mutant R507/K508 which showed almost the same binding affinity as WT SARS-Nsp13 (WT-13) ( Figure 4C ). We supposed that it is because of the special location of the two residues, R507 and K508. They are both situated on the surface of 2A domain and exposed to solution. When the two hydrophilic residues were mutated to alanines, the two hydrophobic alanines can cause the instability of the whole structure of SARS-Nsp13. The instability can be demonstrated through the DSF experiment (Supplementary Figure S5 ). Furthermore, the helicase activity of all the six mutants suffered different degrees of deficiency, among which the mutant K345A/K347A exhibited the lowest activity with the two residues K345 and K347 belonging to the \u242419-\u242420 loop on domain 1A.",

This is based on the fact that there is a reduced number of H/D exchanges in the region 427-437 (Supplementary Table S1 that the surrounding structure around the region 427-437 became more tightened and less exposed to solvent. As a result, we inferred that the 1A domain and 2A domain might be pulled together when the AMPPNP molecule entered the active pocket. The ATP-bound substrate condition represented the finished changed state, which means the conformation change caused by ATP binding has already com-pleted and is ready for the next step. The nucleic acid binding related peptides 511-542 and 496-511 showed less H/D exchanges indicating that more residues are involved in nucleic acid binding within these two regions. In contrast to the 2A domain, the 1A domain adopts a more relaxed structure with the two peptides placed within the nucleic acid binding channel, 318-330 and 358-369 having more H/D Table S1 ) indicates that the 1A and 2A domains tend to be away from each other. Peptides 318-330 and 358-369 of the 1A domain turn from a relaxed condition in substrate state (blue) to a more tightened condition in transition state (red) when ATP hydrolysis occurs.

Amongst the characterized residues for substrate binding, four of them belong to the same \u242419-\u242420 loop on the 1A domain. Results of the H/D exchange assay showed that different from binding ssDNA, the \u242419-\u242420 loop only changed its shift pattern when incubated with dsDNA. We thus deduced that \u242419-\u242420 loop participates in some way in the unwinding process rather than binding. Previous studies showed that virus growth in cells can be attenuated with the introduction of the mutation A335V for MHV-Nsp13 (Mouse Hepatitis Virus-Nsp13) and the viral titer in the liver of infected mice was reduced by 30-fold (28) . The counterpart for A335 in MHV is A336 in SARS-Nsp13 according to the alignment and it is also conserved in MERS-Nsp13, HCoV-229E (Human coronavirus 229E) and PHEV (Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis) (Supplementary Figure S2) . The four residues critical for helicase activity R337, R339, K345 and K347 are basic amino acids. Situated on the entrance of nucleic acid binding channel, they can attract negative charged nucleic acid into the channel. The two mutants R337A/R339A and K345A/K347A both provided two additional hydrophobic alanine residues to prevent the entrance of the nucleic acid into the channel. However, A335 provides a proper steric hindrance to destabilize and wedge the double-stranded part of nucleic acid unwound.",

During the translocation process of SARS-Nsp13, the 1A and 2A domains come close to each other when ATP molecules enters the pocket. The 2A domain tightens the grasp on nucleic acid while the 1A domain loosens the grip on nucleic acid, ready for the next step. At the same time, the 1B domain (166-182) remains grasping the nucleic acid, helping the 1A domain to stabilize the nucleic acid. In the transition state when the hydrolysis occurs, the two domains begin to be taken apart and the more relaxed 1A domain slide along the nucleic acid and regrasps on it when the 1B domain loosen the grip on it. Lastly in the product state, the cleft between the 1A and 2A domains continues to enlarge while one nucleic acid binding region (496-511) on 2A domain loosens and the other region (511-542) tightens. In addition, the 1A domain tightens its grasp on the nucleic acid with the 1B domain also regrasping it.",
