After China, the epidemic has struck hardest in Italy with 827 deaths in few weeks, leading the Italian government to extend emergency Coronavirus measures, including travel restrictions and a ban on public gatherings to the entire country in an effort to contain the epidemic. On March 11 th 2020, the WHO declares the Coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.",

In rectal cancer, despite the evidence coming from randomized trials (4), short-course RT is clearly underproposed in the neoadjuvant setting compared to long-course chemo-RT protocols (5, 6) . As for prostate cancer, all the level 1 evidence converges nowadays on the equivalence of moderate hypofractionation and standard fractionation (7) .",
