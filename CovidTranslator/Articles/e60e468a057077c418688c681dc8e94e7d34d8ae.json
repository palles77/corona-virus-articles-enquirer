Human genetic enhancement, however, raises complex ethical questions, such as to what extent should it be allowed? It has been a great challenge for humankind to develop robust ethical guidelines for human genetic enhancement that address both public concerns and needs. We believe that research about public concerns is necessary prior to developing such guidelines, yet the issues have not been thoroughly investigated in many countries, including Malaysia. Since the novel often functions as a medium for the public to express their concerns, this paper explores ethical concerns about human genetic enhancement expressed in four Malay science fiction novels namely Klon, Leksikon Ledang, Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba and Transgenik Sifar. Religion has a strong influence on the worldview of the Malays therefore some concerns such as playing God are obviously religious. Association of the negative image of scientists as well as the private research companies with the research on human genetic enhancement reflects the authors' concerns about the main motivations for conducting such research and the extent to which such research will benefit society.",

While the definition of perfection may be subjective, humans since time immemorial have sought any advantage to enhance their quality of life and to raise children that are physically and intellectually better than themselves. Thanks to advancements in various fields of science and technology, these pursuits seem more achievable than ever before. One of these advancements is human gene transfer, which involves the transfer of foreign genetic sequences or genetically modified organisms into a human. The purpose of this application is mainly to treat and prevent genetic diseases. Attempts to transfer foreign genes into humans have been done since 1949. One of the first attempts was the use of hepatitis virus in treating Hodgkin disease (Kimmelman 2008) . However, an ethical debate regarding human gene transfer research has only seriously surfaced after an attempt made in the early 1970s to cure argininemia by infecting patients with the Shope papilloma virus (Walters 2012) . Ethical concerns have been raised not only concerning safety and efficacy but also the possibility of opening the doors of genetic enhancement (Kimmelman 2008) .",

            "text": "Human enhancement aims to improve or extend human physical, intellectual, psychological, or moral characteristics beyond a normal range (Peters et al. 2008; Brey 2009 ). Human genetic enhancement refers particularly to the use of genetic engineering such as germline gene transfer to achieve such purposes (Baylis and Robert 2004; Brey 2009 ). It may also be achieved through cloning a person with the desired traits (The Witherspoon Council on Ethics and the Integrity of Science 2015). Despite its potential applications, questions of whether we should pursue such applications and what are the fundamental moral principles that should guide our considerations have been raised (Anderson 1989) . The benefits of human genetic enhancement appeal to parents and nations alike, further complicating the deliberation of whether to allow or ban such applications. People may hesitate at first, but to have children with enhanced cognitive abilities or other superior traits who may later contribute a lot to the national development is an offer that is hard to resist in today's competitive world (Gardner 1995) . Many have argued that human genetic enhancement is not ethically acceptable (President's Council on Bioethics 2003; Resnik 2000) , while others opine that humans have a moral obligation to enhance themselves and their children (Savulescu 2007) . Apart from that, it is difficult to draw a line between the purpose of therapy and enhancement, as therapy may also be considered as a kind of enhancement, and patients undergoing therapy may opt to have enhancement performed as well (Anderson 1989; Parens 1998; Kimmelman 2008; Peters et al. 2008) .",

Such studies also help in developing robust ethical guidelines at both the national and international level. Since such robust guidelines should directly address public concerns and interest (Frewer et al. 1997) , gaining insight into public concerns on human genetic enhancement is therefore imperative in understanding their ethical thinking and facilitating further discussion (Dijkstra and Schuijff 2015) and consequently forming the basis of the guidelines. However, research regarding public concern on human genetic enhancement has not yet been conducted in many countries (Dijkstra and Schuijff 2015) . In Malaysia, attention has been given to studying the public perception of biotechnology in general and other applications such as genetically modified foods [see Amin et al. (2011) ] but not to human genetic enhancement. In terms of available national instruments, specific and clear ethical guidelines on genetic research as well as human genetic enhancement have not yet been developed. Emphasis has been placed on the religious, social, cultural, and ethical values of the Malaysian community as important parts of biological law and regulations such as in the Biosafety (Approval and Notifications) Regulations 2010 (Ramatha and Andrew 2012 ), yet it is not clear which values will be considered and the extent to which these values influence the governmental view of human genetic enhancement.",

Given that genetic enhancement technologies are still largely the domain of science fiction, such novels provide speculative imagination or thought experiments on these technologies, including their ethical and social implications through the rich narratives of the settings, characters, and actions (Van Dijck 1999; Pethes 2005; Smart 2012 ). By using their imagination about the future, the authors express their hope and fear of science and technology in science fiction novels (Bova 1974; Brem and Anijar 2003) . Therefore, science fiction novels are important in enhancing communication between scientists and the public, allowing inclusive ethical dialogue (Delgado et al. 2012) .",

It began as an established literary genre in nineteenth century through the works of European writers such as Jules (Bould and Vint 2011) . Biology has become one of the main themes of this genre. Among popular science fiction novels with a biological theme are Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, More Than Human by Theodore Sturgeon, and Beyond This Horizon by Robert A. Heinlein. Since the discovery of DNA and the genetic code has brought much hope as well as fear to humankind, genetic engineering has become one of the common themes in biological science fictions. One of them is the 1990's novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, which was adapted into a worldwide blockbuster film in 1993. It tells a story about cloning and genetic engineering of dinosaurs for the purpose of entertaining the public at a zoo (Slonczewski and Levy 2003) .",

For example, Neuromancer, a novel about human enhancement written by William Gibson, raises ethical questions about what it means to be a human (Delgado et al. 2012 ). Likewise, Michael Crichton's novel The Terminal Man raises fear of a technology that has potential to become a threat to humanity. Even though this novel is about artificial intelligence, the issues raised are similar to biotechnology and may have influence on the debate of the latter (Pethes 2005) . These novels present hypothetical situations which may allow inclusive and contextualize debates and later can be used as a tool in developing robust guidelines (Delgado et al. 2012) . Science fiction novels have an impact on forming public opinion towards bioethical issues, especially on applications that have not yet been realized. Such an influence may even be more influential than the academic discussion on the same matter (Chan 2009 ). Both proponents and opponents of the new applications sometimes refer to imagery described in science fiction novels in the public debate. Mulkay (1996) explains that negative imagery from the Frankenstein novel was used by the opponents in British Parliament and press to criticize human embryo research. The same imagery was also used by the supporters to explain that the opponent's argument was weak because the imagery was only fictional and could or should not be used as a justification to ban the research.",

However it has not yet issued fatwa regarding human genetic enhancement except one fatwa on reproductive cloning in 2002. Reproductive cloning has been declared impermissible by the council because it is against the fitrah (nature) of human creation (Department of Islamic Development Malaysia 2009). These fatwas, nevertheless, are only brief statements answering the questions of whether applications of science and technology are permissible from an Islamic perspective. They usually do not directly expound all of the public concerns that have been taken into considerations in formulating the fatwa. Apart from that, Malaysia has established its National Bioethics Council in 2012 within which the majority of the members are Malays (www.bioetika.gov.my). This council has not yet issued its perspective on human genetic enhancement.",

Led by Dr. Ching Huat, this project was funded by Datuk Isman Hijjaz who had impatiently sought a cure for his son. The team had found genetically modified mosquitoes in a reserve forest near Mount Ledang. They believed that these mosquitoes were created hundred years ago by the princess. Since seven trays of mosquitoes' heart were among the seven conditions, they encoded the mosquito's genetic codes and tried to combine the codes with other species to produce a superb combination. They later found that combination of DNA from the genetically modified mosquitoes, areca nut and smallpox virus produced an excellent result.

Therefore there is a need for humans to produce offspring that are physically and mentally healthier than the current population to withstand the challenges as well as to reduce healthcare costs.

Both Klon and Transgenik Sifar depict producing a genetically enhanced human as immoral to some people because it involves changing God's creation and transgressing His law. In Transgenik Sifar, Haifa, the assigned psychologist for HUMAM, was against the transgenic human project because it was not in harmony with her religious teachings, whereas Dr. LeMarchel, who was an atheist, did not view the project as ethically problematic and found no reason to stop such a project. Yuhori Hajime, the renowned scientist and the founder of the transgenic human project, had a slightly different view whereby he believed that his project could not be seen as immoral because it showed no differences from other scientific innovations such as making artificial rain, which could also be viewed as attempts to transgress the Divine law.",

She went astray at first due to her obsession to produce a genetically enhanced human, but later felt regret for what she had done. She realized that scientists are merely humans who are incapable of creating humans. Like other humans, scientists are entrusted as God's vicegerents and have a great responsibility to live and do their works according to His laws. These beliefs are deeply rooted in the Islamic worldview, especially since the author depicted both Flora and Datin Kay as Muslims. Muslims believe that God is the only one who has the power to create humans and that He creates humans in the best form 1 (Ali 1996) . Humans have no capability to create things as He does, not even a fly. 2 His creations are always perfect and humans are not allowed to modify the nature as they wish because each creation has Divine wisdom behind it (Al-Hayani 2008) . In this regard, Nasr (1968) stated that damage on the earth occurs when a human 'wants to play the role of God, to create and destroy, to dominate and rule, without realizing that he is not God'.",

In Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba, Flora named herself because she did not want to be identified by numbers. She was placed in a room at the research institute and not allowed to go outside. HUMAM in Transgenik Sifar underwent a series of tests in his life which at first he found traumatic. He was considered as an asset of the company which was produced to carry out search and rescue missions. He was not happy with his life because he felt as if he was treated as an animal, and later planned to destroy the company to stop the production of genetically enhanced humans. Brey (2009) stated that genetically enhanced humans are likely to have serious conflicts with their identity which may lower their self-esteem even though they have special characteristics that make them outstanding from normal human beings. This concern about the identity conflicts faced by the genetically enhanced humans has also been raised in science fiction films such as Blade. Blade, whose genetics had been changed due to a vampire's attack, had been blessed with superior abilities such as the ability to withstand sunlight.

Dr. Frankenstein as 'mad' scientist and his monstrous creation represent the public concern not only about the scientists who may abuse science for their own interests but also about unethical use of science and technology that is destructive to humankind (Rollin 1986 ). Today, as Haynes (2016) noted, the image of scientists in science fiction novels and films has gradually become better than before whereby they have progressively been portrayed as ordinary people who care greatly about the public and the planet as a whole. One of the factors contributing to the change is increasing public familiarity with scientists and their work as a result of their frequent appearance in television programs communicating about their work while showing the image of responsible professionals and citizens. Nevertheless the image of 'mad' scientist is still apparent in the selected novels.

Datin Kay was obsessed with her scientific endeavor and believed that she had rights to do any research that she thought was beneficial. She wanted to prove that a transgenic human could be produced. Therefore, she secretly conducted research, even though the research proposal was not approved by the ethics review board. When she was asked why she still proceeded to do her research, she replied: \u2026 a scientist should not necessarily be tied down by questions of ethical issues. If scientists get caught up in such issues, it will be impossible for the world of science to quickly expand past current limitations. Development of new technologies will become impossible, and gains in modernization and progress will be hampered. (translated excerpt from p. 166)",

One of the bad consequences is the ignorance of the scientists toward the use of a safe and efficient research method. This may waste resources and inflict harm on research participants as well as the society. In Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba a transgenic human was successfully produced only after 4790 trials. The failure rate was high because Datin Kay tried to use an artificial uterus at first before switching to surrogacy. Thousands of embryos were used in the research and this shows that such research may bring harm to many parties, including the egg providers. This reference to 4790 trials highlights the author's hope that scientists particularly those who are involved in human research would only use methods that are proven to be safe and efficient. Such safety concerns have been widely shared among the public not only regarding the human cloning or gene transfer, but also recent technologies such as genome editing (Jaenisch and Wilmut 2001; Lander 2015) .",

This can be seen in Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba in which Datin Kay, who was portrayed as a 'mad' scientist in the beginning of the story, later regretted creating a transgenic human and realized that she was merely a scientist that had no power to create a human. This is also expressed through a dialogue in the novel between a supporter and an opponent of human genetic enhancement. The opponent argued that humans are not machines and they are already perfect physically, mentally and emotionally. He insisted that harm will be inflicted upon humankind if the scientists follow their lust Klon has also mentioned that scientists with a lack of religious conscience or faith would have a strong tendency to commit wrongdoings in science. Emphasis on the need for religious guidance in doing science in both novels reflects the authors' belief in the unity of religion, particularly Islam, and science. Such a belief is common among Muslims whereby they believe that Islam informs scientists about the real purpose of their existence, which prevents them from committing unlawful actions, as well as the real purpose of science to serve humanity (Bakar 2014) .",

Priority had become a concern in this novel because the world was facing an environmental crisis, and those resources could be used to solve the wider problems.

Dr. Ching Huat was even worse as he obediently followed his employer's commands even though some of them were unethical. These portrayals show that the authors may distrust scientists working at private companies. Given that the primary goal of the private companies is to gain maximum profit, the scientists affiliated with these companies, as Critchley and Turney (2004) noted, may be perceived to be motivated more to achieve that goal rather than serving the public needs. Critchley (2008) showed that the public has a lower trust in private scientists compared to the public scientists, often accusing private research companies of having a hidden agenda. The authors of the selected novels seem to share the same concern about secrecy and lack of transparency in science that has much to do with the private research companies and their goals. They complained that the goals had not been made public, even scientists who worked at the company had not been informed about the real aim of such research. In Transgenik Sifar, the public had been informed that HUMAM was produced to help with a search and rescue mission whereas the real agenda was to produce batches of military personnel.",
