Extract of the flowers and leaves showed relatively higher activity than the extracts of other plant parts. Thirteen compounds were isolated from both the flowers and flower-peduncles of A. hijazensis. The isolated compounds were classified into: five anthraquinones; ziganein, ziganein-5-methyl ether, aloesaponarin I, chrysophanol, aloe-emodin, one dihydroisocoumarin; feralolide, four flavonoids; homoplantaginin, isoorientin, luteolin 7-glucuronopyranoside, isovitexin, one phenolic acid; p-coumaric acid, the anthrone; barbaloin together with aloenin. Eleven compounds were attributed to the flowers and seven to the flower-peduncles. Homoplantaginin and luteolin 7-glucuronopyranoside are reported here for the first time from Aloe spp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the chemical composition and biological activity of those plant parts. . Voucher specimens (no. N012411) were deposited in the herbarium of King Abdul-Aziz University.",

According to one estimate, 25% of commonly used medicines contain compounds isolated from plants (Perera and Efferth, 2012) . Several plants could offer a rich reserve for drug discovery of infectious diseases. Viruses have been resistant to therapy or prophylaxis longer than any other form of life. Currently, there are only a few drugs available for the cure of viral diseases, including acyclovir, which is modeled on a natural product parent. In order to combat viruses which have devastating effects on different living organisms, many research efforts have been devoted to the discovery of new antiviral natural products (Mbanga et al., 2010; Perera and Efferth, 2012) . Screening studies have been carried out in order to find antiviral agents from natural sources, and the occurrence of antiviral activity in extracts of plants is frequent. It should be noted that a variety of medicinal plants have shown promise to treat a number of viral infections, and some of them possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity (Dao et al., 2011; Perera and Efferth, 2012) .",

Infection with APMV constitutes the most serious epizootic poultry disease throughout the world. Its infection occurs every year and frequently leaves no survivors in unvaccinated flocks, causing devastating epidemics and serious economic losses. Therefore, the disease is called 'the bomb' because it causes a huge number of victims in poultry flocks, as a bombshell would do (Hines and Miller, 2012) . In addition, during the past ten years, a series of avian epidemics, a significant reemergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI-H5N1), has been reported in several Asian, European and African countries including Egypt and Saudi Arabia (Dao et al., 2011) . In attempts to control the disease, millions of birds have been destroyed. Anti-influenza agents from some plants, discovered as a result of chemical and pharmacological studies, were reported (Dao et al., 2011) .",

Antiviral agents of plant origin can have easy acceptability because they are both non-toxic and inexpensive (Perera and Efferth, 2012) . In Kenya, Gambia, and Zimbabwe, the crushed leaves of Aloe species are given to infected chickens in drinking water as viral diseases remedy (Mbanga et al., 2010) . The efficacy of the crude extract of Aloe secundiflora in chickens experimentally infected with Newcastle disease virus was reported (Waihenya et al., 2002 ). An in vitro study (Fahim and Wang, 1996) using zinc acetate and lyophilized A. barbadensis (7.5 and 10 percent) demonstrated an antiviral effect. The study concluded that it might be useful as a contraceptive, especially significant in preventing the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Aloe vera has even been approved in clinical trials as nutritional support for HIV patients (Singh et al., 2010) . It apparently hinders the virus's ability to reproduce. A. vera showed antiviral activity against the herpes simplex virus (Zandi et al., 2007) , and its gel and extract (0.5%) in hydrophilic cream were applied for the management of genital herpes in males (Syed et al., 1996) . A pharmaceutical formula containing A. vera was used in treatment of cervical high risk human papillomavirus (HRHPV) infection (Iljazovic et al., 2006) . Antiviral activity was shown in an in vitro study using a purified extract of A. barbadensis (Singh et al., 2010) . The main activity against cytomegalovirus was shown 12-36 h after infection.",

            "text": "Haemagglutination viruses are viruses capable of agglutinating the red blood cells of a variety of animals. They directly agglutinate erythrocytes by binding to specific receptor sites on the surface of the erythrocyte, and this characteristic can be used in detection of the virus. Inhibition of haemagglutination caused by these viruses is the detection of their activity's inhibition. The plant parts of leaves and flowers showed remarked antiviral activity compared to the other parts of roots and flower-peduncles. In chicken embryos, the activity of plant parts as determined by haemagglutinating activity in allantoic fluids (Table I) indicated 6, 6, 8 and 6 \u00b5g/0.2 mL/egg for the leaves, roots, flowerpeduncles, and flowers, respectively. The ethanol extract of leaves and flowers of A. hijazensis respectively were fully reduced the infectivity of 5000 EID 50 of APMV-1 virus (Table I ). In each case of the tested virus; APMV-1, H5N1, NDV, and Adenovirus; egg drug syndrome virus (EDSV), the toxicity assays in chicken embryos indicated that at concentration of 700 and 800 \u00b5g/egg for flowers and leaves, respectively were showed by 100% of the inoculated embryos without death on the 3 rd -4 th days after inoculation. The recorded therapeutic indices (TI) were 116 and 133, respectively in APMV-1 infection while it was 100% in each of avian H5N1 and NDV virus infection for both flowers and leaves. The recorded therapeutic indices were 114 and 116, respectively in avian Adenovirus infection. Contrasting this study's results (Table II) , embryonated eggs inoculated with a mixture of the APMV-1 with the ethanol extract of each plant part separately did not retard the virus replication, and pooled allantoic fluid from each group of eggs receiving varying concentration of each extract with the same concentration of virus showed 1:8 to 1:32 HA titer at 5 \u00b5g/mL for the leaves while the HA titer was 1:16 to 1:32 HA titer at the 5 \u00b5g/mL for the flowers. However, the present study conclusively revealed the pronounced inhibitory effect of ethanol extracts of leaves and flowers against haemagglutinating viruses' infections. The activity may be related to the bioactive constituents present in plant parts. The leaves and roots of A. hijazensis are rich sources of biologically active compounds such as anthraquinones, chromones, anthrones, and flavonoids (Abd-Alla et al., 2009b) . The antiviral action may be due to direct and indirect effects (Hamman, 2008) . Indirect effect is due to stimulation of the immune system. Direct effect is due to anthraquinones. The anthraquinone barbaloin inactivates various enveloped viruses such as influenza (Sydiskis et al., 1991) . Many anthraquinones, such as emodin and barbaloin, have shown antiviral and/or virucidal effects (Alves et al., 2004) . Antiviral activity of anthrone and anthraquinone derivatives against ganciclovir-sensitive and -resistant strains of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) were reported (Barnard et al., 1992) . Saoo et al. (1996) suggested that a major mechanism of inhibition of CMV infection by Aloe extract is through interference with DNA synthesis. Anthraquinones isolated from the exudate of A. vera have shown wide antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial activity of emodin was proposed to be mediated through inhibition of solute transport in membranes (Hamman, 2008) . Aloe-emodin is an interferon-inducing agent with antiviral activity against Japanese encephalitis virus and enterovirus (Lin et al., 2008) and also showed anti-SARS coronavirus 3C-like protease effect when tested (Lin et al., 2005) . It dose-dependently inhibited cleavage activity of the 3CL pro , in which the IC 50 was 366 \u00b5M. The antiviral activity of 1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone against poliovirus was reported (Semple et al., 2001) .",

Depending on its chromatographic properties and UV spectral data, it was suspected to be a mono-C-glycosyl derivative (Harborne and Mabry, 1982) . Negative HRESI-MS spectrum showed a molecular ion peak at 447.09544 corresponding to the molecular weight and molecular formula of mono-C-hexosyl-luteolin structure. 1 H-NMR spectrum, B-ring protons were assigned as an ABX-spin coupling system of the three types of protons H-2', H-6' and H-5'. At ~\u03b4 6.6 ppm, H-3 was assigned as a singlet. The absence of H-6 resonance in the spectrum and appearance of H-8 as a singlet at ~\u03b4 6.4 led us to the placement of the C-hexoside moiety at C-6. This evidence was further supported by the diagnostic anomeric proton signal at \u03b4 4.54 ppm of the characteristic J value (9.2 Hz) for the \u03b2-C-glycosyl moiety. 13 C-NMR spectrum of compound (9) revealed the presence of 15 carbon resonances, characteristic for a luteolin moiety (Agrawal and Bansal, 1989) . The presence of a \u03b2-C-glycopyranoside was proved from its characteristic six C-resonances in the range of about 82-60 ppm, particularly that of C-1'' (anomeric carbon) at \u03b4 73.6 ppm. The location of this glucopyranoside moiety on C-6 was suggested from the downfield shift of its resonance to 109.5 (\u00b110 ppm) and the slight upfield shifts of both C-5 and C-7 signals (Harborne and Mabry, 1982; Agrawal and Bansal, 1989) . The compound was identified as luteolin 6-C-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (isoorientin).",

Upon acid hydrolysis, it gave D-glucuronic acid and luteolin. 1 H-NMR spectrum showed downfield shifts by both H-8 and H-6 of about \u03b4 0.2 ppm that indicated 7-O-glycosidation (Agrawal and Bansal, 1989 ) at \u03b4 6.85 and 6.46 ppm, respectively.
