These ongoing developments have increased the application of mathematical models to both the generation and testing of basic scientific hypotheses and the design of practical strategies for disease control.

In this way, mathematics is \"no more, but no less, than a way of thinking clearly about the problem in hand\" (Ref. 5) . The extent and quality of available data can be variable. Ideally, data should be analysed using models that adequately describe the observed dynamics and patterns of interest, and the mechanisms that generate these observations. Models should be as simple as possible, but not so simple that the conclusions drawn are altered by the consideration of additional realistic complexity. Unnecessary complexity can obscure fundamental results and is almost as undesirable as over-simplification. Indeed, model choice -the process of deciding which model complexities are necessary -is a central part of mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.",

In reality, however, the infectiousness and susceptibility of an individual are influenced by many different factors. Individuals can be categorized by any factors that are considered to be important for infectious disease transmission and can be labelled i = 1,2,...n (n denotes the number of different categories of individuals; Diekmann and Heesterbeek 13 refer to these as h-states). In a randomly mixing population, the offspring distribution is derived from the mixture of the distributions for each individual, weighted according to their frequency. For example, the susceptibleinfected-recovered (sIR) model assumes a constant infectivity \u03b2 while an individual remains infected and a constant rate of recovery from infection \u03b1 such that the time that is spent infectious is exponentially distributed 20 . Infectious individuals can therefore be categorized by their infectious period, and summing over the distribution of infectious periods provides an offspring distribution that follows a geometric distribution with mean R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b1 (a mixture of Poisson distributions with exponentially distributed means). This distribution is highly skew and over-dispersed compared with the Poisson distribution (the variance is more than the mean). Therefore, the stochastic sIR model shows considerable variability between individuals in their contribution to transmission.",

Care needs to be taken to account for immunity of contacts to infection, to adjust for the fact that transmission events are not usually observed, but rather some surrogate of infection is recorded (such as symptoms or microbiological diagnosis) and for censored observations (when individuals cannot be followed up for a particular reason or have not completed their infectious period).",

If infection is introduced to each community simultaneously, the resulting epidemic will follow the expected pattern of spread for an unstructured population 20 .

The resulting decline in the number of individuals that are susceptible to infection is known as saturation. If the immune response is ineffective and the infection is long-lived, such as in some chronic infections, repeat infection with the same species of pathogen can result in 'super-infection'. For infections such as intestinal nematodes, flukes, filarial nematodes and tapeworms, usually referred to as macroparasites, this process of super-infection results in an aggregated distribution of the parasites among the host population and enables sexual reproduction of the parasite. For these macroparasitic infections, mathematical models that focus on the number of parasites and their distribution among hosts tend to yield more insight compared with models that take the number of infected hosts as their fundamental unit 3 . saturation leads to non-linear disease dynamics, in which the incidence of infection is a function of both the current number of infected individuals and the number of susceptible individuals. what this function should be is still debated 3, 53 . Two of the most common approaches are to assume density dependence, in which the number of contacts that are made by an individual increases with population numbers, such that incidence depends on the number of infected individuals (incidence = \u03b2xy, in which \u03b2 is infectiousness, x is the number of susceptible individuals and y is the number of infected individuals), and to assume frequency dependence, in which the number of contacts is independent of population size and incidence depends on the fraction of contacts that are infected (incidence = \u03b2xy/n). Tests of the fit of these functions for the incidence of childhood infections and sexually transmitted diseases have typically found support for largely frequency-dependent transmission, with limited dependence on population numbers 3, 54 .",

The distribution of individuals among households is a crucial determinant for the spread of many directly transmitted infections, such as influenza, trachoma, measles and smallpox. within a household, all susceptible individuals could become infected following the initial infection event and the potential for further transmission of disease is therefore restricted, despite the ongoing infectiousness of household members. This can complicate estimation of the generation-time distribution for an infectious disease. The spread of infection in this case might be more easily described by the time between the initial infection of households (the household generation-time distribution) and the average number of households that are infected by a single infected individual in a household (the household reproduction number) 32,55,56 . simple models that assume random mixing do not readily capture the effects of local saturation in limiting the spread of infection. Much recent work has focused on measuring and describing contact patterns and examining the impact of local contact-network structure on infectious disease dynamics 7,57-65 . Usually, local saturation occurs rapidly, and subsequent dynamics are driven by global contacts, which means that an epidemic in a highly structured population can show rapid initial growth, suggesting a high R 0 , even though subsequent dynamics can be consistent with a much lower reproduction number 58 .",

Changes in incidence can be a function of factors that are extrinsic to the infection, such as host behavioural change or environmental fluctuations (for example, seasonal changes in climate or changes in behaviour during school holidays). However, even in the absence of these external factors, the intrinsic non-linear interaction between the number of susceptible and infected individuals can drive complex boom-bust, periodic or even chaotic dynamics 67 . The intrinsic non-linear dynamics of endemic infections can be simple and predictable, or complex and unpredictable, depending on the natural history of the infection and the host immune response (oscillations in disease incidence often occur, such as those demonstrated for syphilis in the United states 68 ). seasonal variation in transmission can further complicate patterns of incidence; for example, increases in seasonal variation in transmission are associated with a higher number of years between epidemics 69 . The interaction of seasonality, non-linear dynamics and stochasticity can lead to very complicated dynamics [70] [71] [72] , which can make the interpretation of infectious disease surveillance data a difficult task, with transient dynamics not necessarily reflecting underlying trends. The challenge in these cases is to distinguish the complex intrinsic dynamics from changes in extrinsic factors that might be of interest, such as changes in behaviour or vaccine coverage.",

Inevitably, there will be an element of subjectivity in the choice of model, and in some cases the model might need to be revised in the light of new observations, which would lead to an iterative process of model development. The ability of a model to explain data can be formally assessed using methods for statistical inference. These can be categorized into three broad approaches: frequentist, Bayesian and information theoretic (reviewed in . all three approaches are based on different uses of the concept of likelihood. The likelihood of a model based on an observed set of data is proportional to the probability of the observed data if that model is true, the constant of proportionality being arbitrary. likelihood can be used to estimate parameters and compare models. In particular, likelihood is a key measure in deciding whether additional complexity in model structure is warranted in terms of improving our ability to describe data. The exact comparison will depend on the inference framework (for measures such as the likelihood ratio, the akaike and Bayesian information criteria [73] [74] [75] ), but all these methods balance the gain in likelihood that is achieved by extending a model with the increase in the number of parameters that are needed to describe that model.",

            "text": "To calculate a likelihood, the transmission model must be stochastic and capable of predicting the probability of different outcomes (as the likelihood is the probability that the data was generated by that model). a formal starting point for defining a likelihood for a time series of observations of an infectious disease system could therefore be a stochastic model that predicts the distribution of the number of people in different states at different times. The sources of stochasticity could arise from the transmission process itself (the offspring distribution) and from the observation or sampling process. Infection events depend on prevalent infectious cases, which, in turn, depend on earlier infection events, as clearly shown by the renewal equation (Equation 3 ). Therefore, all observations in an epidemic time series are correlated and should be viewed as part of a single observation of the epidemic process. For example, random effects that occur early in an epidemic, when the number of infections is small, significantly affect subsequent epidemic spread and can lead to different epidemic dynamics for the same underlying parameters (fIG. 3d) . For this reason, repeated and possibly incomplete observations of independent epidemics are often easier to assess than detailed, but temporally correlated data, from a single epidemic. The difficulty of dealing with temporally correlated data is that, even for small epidemics, the likelihood can be difficult to write down and thus calculate for a given model and data. several exact and approximate approaches have been reviewed in Refs 76, 77. In particular, Bayesian methods are beginning to result in progress in this area, by treating unknown events, such as individual infection times, as random variables to be estimated. a particular simplification arises for 'memoryless' ('Markovian') transmission models. These are equivalent to sIR and related models, in which individuals occupy 'compartments' (for example, infectious or recovered) and the rate of leaving the compartment depends only on the current state of the epidemic and not its history. In such models, if the state variables, such as the number of susceptible individuals, are known at a point in time, then incidence over the next time step is an independent random variable 76, 78 . The problem then requires inference of the unknown state variables, rather than disentangling the likelihood for the whole epidemic. For example, this approach has been applied to data on Ebola 79 , hospital-acquired infections 80 and measles 81 .",

Mathematical descriptions of nonrandom mixing need to go beyond simply dividing the population into discrete compartments to a more complete representation of the contact patterns that lead to infectious disease transmission. Computer simulations could provide insights, but the development of analytical approximations of the contact process would be far more powerful if they could provide simple rules (and predictions) for the emergent dynamics of an epidemic.
