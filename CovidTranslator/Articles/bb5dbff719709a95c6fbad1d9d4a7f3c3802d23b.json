There are around 200 zoonoses 3 and approximately 40 of these are associated with amphibians and reptiles (for examples, see Appendices A and B). Captive reptiles are routinely identified as reservoirs of infectious bacteria, for example, Salmonella, 4 and all reptiles should be presumed to harbour Salmonella. 1,5 -8 In 2009, a case-control study in the UK indicated that reptile keepers were nearly 17 times more likely to get sick than those who had no contact with these animals. 9 A limited study of seven door handles at a major pet market in Germany in 2010 revealed the presence of two distinct species of Salmonella, S. ramatgan and S. subspecies V (N Kutscher, personal communication, 2011), both of which are reptile-associated.",

            "text": "More generally, a survey of 1410 human diseases found 61% to be of potentially zoonotic origin. 10 Also, 75% of global emerging human diseases are zoonotic. 11 It is believed that epidemics such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), monkey-pox and avian influenza H5N1 may have emerged from wildlife markets. 1, 5, 8, 11 The arbitrary mixing of a wide variety of species that would not normally meet together in conditions of highly questionable animal husbandry and public health protection measures, raises multifactorial concerns about these markets and their implications for public health. 1, 5, 8, 12, 13 Many cases of zoonotic disease are, however, probably misdiagnosed as other conditions and under-reporting in general is a likely major factor in under-ascertainment of cases. 2 Certain common zoonoses symptomatically superficially resemble common illnesses such as gastrointestinal, respiratory, influenzal and dermatological disorders and disease. General medical practitioners who are unfamiliar with zoonoses do not typically enquire of patients about direct or indirect contact with an exotic animal. 2 Significant zoonotic episodes arise from indirect contact with an animal. Indirect pathogen contamination and dissemination involving reptiles and intermediary surfaces, for example, door handles, clothes, table tops, walls, household utensils and shaking of hands, has been reported as an important factor in transmission. 7, 14, 15 One notable example involved over 300 public attendees to a zoo who acquired Salmonella infection via a wooden stand-off barrier around a lizard enclosure and despite having had no actual contact with the reptiles. 16 The presumed primary transmission route for many amphibian-and reptile-borne potential pathogens is via faecal -oral ingestion. 17 However, human skin scratches from the claws of lizards, 18 and bites from snakes and lizards also may transmit contaminants. 14, 18 Also, direct contact between any contaminated reptile and open human lesions, such as sores, or via reptile debris penetrating human orbital or aural sites, are further potential routes of infection. 14 Aquatic turtles and other species of waterdwelling reptiles may contaminate large bodies of water -resulting in contaminated splashes, droplets and smears that may lead to human infection. Lizards are handled more than turtles and are more likely to introduce infection via skin scratches. Snakes are handled far more frequently than even lizards and thus may spread contaminants more widely and consistently. Diverse surfaces may act as intermediary carriers of many biotic contaminants and once a surface is contaminated, potential contagions may long persist. 19 Hand washing and the use of disinfectant gels and sprays are commonly recommended and perceived as sufficient hygiene measures to eradicate Salmonella and any other potential pathogens. 14, 15 However, these hygiene methods, as generally practiced, do not provide reliable protection against diverse amphibian-and reptile-borne contaminants. 14, 15 Indeed, the use of these materials and methods may generate undue over-reliance and misplaced confidence in personal disease prevention and control that may lead to infection as a result of complacency. 20 The aim of this investigation was to assess public behaviour in the context of potential contamination threats at close-quarters in a probable zoonotic pathogen rich environment. We conducted on-site assessments at three key European pet market events: Terraristika (Hamm, Germany), the IHS Show (Doncaster, UK) and Expoterraria (Sabadell, Spain) during 2011. Each event involves a substantial number of stalls that collectively sell thousands of exotic animals directly to the public. Several hundred such events occur annually throughout Europe. 21 ",

Pathogen transfer from local contamination sources is well known, and it is reasonable to anticipate that at a stall at which animals are sold, all animals and animal-related material will probably have been exposed to microbial transfer and dissemination.",

Results were marked on preprinted tables under categories of 'Direct', 'Indirect,' 'H1 0 , 'H2 0 and 'H3 0 , and tallied after each five-minute observation period. Hygiene efforts (referring to intentional efforts of a person to sanitize their hands or related action) were recorded (not tabulated) by observing whether or not individuals attempted to, for example, clean their hands immediately after contact with a presumed contaminated source.",

The direct and indirect actions and interactions between public attendees and sellers are manifestly capable not only of resulting in acquired infection among attendees, but also of disseminating pathogens among the public and all publicly accessible intermediary surfaces. Indeed, we postulate that it would be reasonable to conclude that within a relatively brief period, all public attendees potentially may be subjected to some level of contamination on their person, whether or not that contamination becomes associated with any episode of disease involving themselves or others. It is also highly unlikely that any method of hygiene control could be practicably implemented in the context of a pet market. Even if comprehensive disinfectant surgical scrub areas were provided with appropriate guidance on contaminant elimination from hands, then this would not offer a reliable solution. Contaminated areas other than hands would remain, and re-contamination of hands and other areas from clothes, people and the environment would likely rapidly re-occur once the person returned to the generalized areas of the pet market and its multifactorial contamination sources. Contamination of clothes and hair, for instance, would also Figure 3 Public health and visitor behaviour at three European markets.

Certain bacteria, such as Salmonella, are well understood to viably persist on surfaces in the general environment. At venues hosting pet markets it is reasonable to presume that all public contact surfaces such as door handles, floors, doorways, walls, light switches and many others may remain microbially contaminated and thus potential sources of infection. Given that these same venues may be sequentially used for a wide variety of other public purposes, including schooling of children, there exists an ongoing potential residual risk of infection to entirely unsuspecting and unprepared users. Furthermore, these venues are often located adjacent to shopping centres which market visitors may attend, carrying with them a host of pathogens and the potential to spread disease far beyond the source of original contamination. As such, even non-attendance at a pet market does not guarantee that public health is not compromised.",
