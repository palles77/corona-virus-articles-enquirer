The TCoV polyprotein gene encoded two open reading frames (ORFs), which are translated into two products, pp1a and pp1ab, the latter being produced via \u22121 frameshift translation. TCoV polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab were predicted to be processed to 15 non-structure proteins (nsp2-nsp16), with nsp1 missing. ClustalW analysis revealed 88.99% identity and 96.99% similarity for pp1ab between TCoV and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) at the amino acid level. The whole genome consists of 27,749 nucleotides for 540 and 27,816 nucleotides for ATCC, excluding the poly(A) tail. A total of 13 ORFs were predicted for TCoV. Five subgenomic RNAs were detected from ATCC-infected turkey small intestines by Northern blotting. The whole genome sequence had 86.9% identity between TCoV and IBV, supporting that TCoV is a group 3 coronavirus.",

The outbreak of the disease was first reported more than 40 years ago, and the viral agent responsible for the disease was identified as turkey coronavirus in 1973 (Ritchie et al., 1973) . TCoV infects the small intestine of turkey poults and causes disruption of the infected tissue resulting in reduced surface area of intestine, reduced consumption of food and apparent decrease in body weight of infected turkeys. The mortality rate is low, however. The outbreaks of TCoV were mostly reported from turkey farms in the US and Europe (Cavanagh, 2005; Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1997) . Based on the antigenic relationship between TCoV and other coronaviruses, TCoV was classified with avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which infects chicken, as a group 3 coronavirus within the Genus Coronavirus, Family Coronaviridae, and Order Nidovirales (Gonzalez et al., 2003) .",

There are four structural genes encoded by all coronavirus genomes so far sequenced; these are spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), and nucleocapside protein (N). The genome organization of coronavirus is 5 -polymerase-S-E-M-N-3 . An untranslated region (UTR) is located at both the 5 and 3 ends of the genome. The production of structural proteins is through transcription of a set of co-terminal subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA). The molecular mechanisms of genome replication and transcription are not fully understood, but the discontinuous negative-strand extension model has gained wide acceptance (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995; Sawicki et al., 2007) .",

The polymerase is necessary and sufficient for genome replication and transcription because purified viral RNA or in vitro transcribed viral RNA from cDNA construct are infectious when transfected into permissive cells (Yount et al., 2000) . However, nucleocapsid protein greatly enhanced coronavirus genome replication (Almazan et al., 2004; Schelle et al., 2005) , suggesting that nucleocapsid protein may have a regulatory role for coronavirus replication. When viral genomic RNA enters the host cell, ORF1a (pp1a) and polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) are translated first, the latter being translated through a \u22121 frameshift translation mechanism (Bredenbeek et al., 1990; Brierley et al., 1989; Herold and Siddell, 1993; Lee et al., 1991) . Coronavirus pp1ab contains a 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and a papain-like proteinase (PLP) that automatically cleave themselves from polyprotein and further process the polyprotein into more than 15-16 non-structure proteins (nsps) (Weiss et al., 1994) including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12), an NTPase/Helicase (nsp13) for unwinding dsRNA, and three other proteins recently predicted to be a nuclease ExoN homolog (nsp14), an endoRNAse (nsp15), and a 2 -O-methyltransferase (2 -O-MT, nsp16) (Snijder et al., 2003) . The biochemical functions of some of these enzymes were recently characterized (Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Ivanov et al., 2004a,b; Ivanov and Ziebuhr, 2004; Minskaia et al., 2006; Snijder et al., 2003) , and their in vivo roles are under investigation.",

Sequence analysis indicated that the sequences of M and N of TCoV shared over 80% sequence identity with that of IBV. However, the S gene shared less than 40% sequence similarity to any known coronavirus S genes (Lin et al., 2004) . These results suggest that TCoV may have diverged from IBV during evolution. In this study, we continue to determine and analyze the nucleotide sequence of the polyprotein gene of TCoV and use bioinformatics to predict potential functional domains encoded by TCoV polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab). The polymerase gene sequence is then combined with structure gene sequence to assemble the full-length genome sequence for TCoV.",

Based on sequence results, bioinformatics analysis was used to design PCR primers to amplify the remaining sequence of ORF 1a gene. Expand LA PCR system (Roche) was used for all PCR amplification. The PCR reaction consisted of 1\u00d7 PCR buffer, 1.7 mM MgCl 2 , 500 nM each of dNTPs, 200 pmol of each primer, 2 l of cDNA, and 0.25 unit of DNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 l.

One 3Clike proteinase (3CLpro) was predicted to reside in nsp5 due to its conserved residues responsible for 3CLpro activity ( Supplementary  Fig. S2 ) (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) ; one papain-like proteinase (PLpro) was identified in nsp3 due to its conserved PLP residues (CHD) ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Like another group 3 coronavirus, IBV, only one active PLpro was predicted for TCoV. The structure of TCoV nsp3 bears similar organization to nsp3 of IBV in that the Ac domain, X domain (ADPR), and Y domain were all present and arranged in the same order ( Fig. 1(b) ). Comparison of amino acid sequences of each nsp of TCoV with those of other coronaviruses predicted several putative enzymatic activities; among them, the enzymatic activity and potentials of nsp2, nsp5 ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ), nsp13 ( Supplementary Fig. S5), nsp14 (Supplementary Fig. S6 ), and nsp15 ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ) were confirmed in other coronaviruses by (Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Eckerle et al., 2007; Fang et al., 2006; Graham et al., 2005; Kiemer et al., 2004) .

For both TCoV isolates, the percentage of nucleotide composition was 29% for A, 33% for U, 22% for G, and 16% for C. A + U was 62%, indicating that the genome of TCoV was AU rich. The genome nucleotide sequence identity between 540 and ATCC was 92.8% by Clastal W. 540 and ATCC shared nucleotide sequence identity of 86.9% and 87.5% with that of IBV, respectively.",

As found in other coronaviruses (Brian and Baric, 2005) , the 5 UTR of TCoV encoded an ORF of 11 amino acids (Supplementary Table S2 ). Using the ORF finder at NCBI, it was revealed that there were 13 putative ORFs in the genomes of TCoV isolates ATCC and 540. These ORFs were 1a, 1b, 2 (spike), 3a, 3b, 3c (envelope), 4a (matrix), 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b, 6a (nucleocapsid), and 6b ( Fig. 1(a) ; Tables 1 and 2). 4b came immediately after the matrix gene. 6b was immediately following N gene. By comparison with another group 3 coronavirus, IBV-Beaudette, it was found out that 4c and 6b were not present in IBV-Beaudette ( Fig. 1(a) ). The prediction of 6b was not expected. After N gene, the nucleotide sequences of TCoV and IBV-Beaudette were highly conserved ( Supplementary  Fig. S9 ). However, there was no ORF in this region of IBV, so the 3 UTR of IBV was over 500 nt. In both isolates of TCoV, a 74-aa 3 . Northern blotting of total RNA isolated from TCoV infected turkey small intestines. Total RNA (10 g) was isolated from mock or ATCC infected turkey small intestines 3 days post infection, separated on 1% agarose gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and detected with 32P labeled PCR probe corresponding to N gene. The sizes (kb) on the right indicate the predicted size of genomic and subgenomic RNA. X indicates assumed DI RNA. ORF (6b) was predicted in this region irrespective of nucleotide sequence conservation between TCoV and IBV. The prediction of ORF 6b reduced the potential 3 UTR of TCoV to less than 301-nts as compared with 506-nts in IBV. Determination of whether or not proteins of 4b, 4c, and 6b were produced requires further experimental confirmation. A consensus octanucleotide motif GGAAGAGC was found 72-nt upstream of the poly(A) tail in 540 and ATCC genomes of the TCoV. In mouse hepatitis virus, the octanucleotide motif was found to be unnecessary for virus replication in vitro, but a deletion mutant showed reduced replication in mouse brain, suggesting that the octanucleotide motif affects pathogenesis (Goebel et al., 2007) . A consensus transcriptional regulated sequence (TRS) (CUUAACAAA) was found located at the 3 end of the genome leader (1-64 nt) and in front of each structure gene and major accessory gene with either an exact match (sg3-6) or one mismatch (sg2). A total of five sgRNA were predicted for production of structure and accessory proteins in the genome of TCoV.",
