            "text": "Bovine eimeriosis is considered to be of considerable importance for the productivity and health of cattle worldwide. Despite the importance of cattle farming in Austria, little is known in this country about the abundance and distribution of bovine Eimeria spp. The objective of this study was to obtain detailed information about the occurrence of different Eimeria spp. on Austrian dairy farms. Fecal samples from individual calves (n0868) from 296 farms all over Austria (82 districts) were collected. Additionally, each farmer was questioned about the occurrence of calf diarrhea, and about the knowledge on coccidiosis and possible control measures. On 97.97% of the investigated farms, calves excreted Eimeria oocysts, and 83.67% of the individual samples were positive. After sporulation of positive samples pooled from each farm, 11 Eimeria species were found, with E. bovis (in 65.54% of the samples and 27.74% of the farms), E.zuernii (63.85%/13.86%), E. auburnensis (56.76%/13.41%) and E. ellipsoidalis (54.05%/14.38%) being the most prevalent, followed by E. alabamensis (45.61%/11.56%), E. subspherica (35.14%/5.5.05%), E. cylindrica (33.11%/7.00%), and E. canadensis (31.08%/7.74%). E. wyomingensis, E. pellita and E. bukidnonensis were only found sporadically (3.04-4.73% of the samples and 0.16-0.59% of the farms). Mixed infections were present on all farms (2-9 Eimeria species/ farm). Prevalences by state provinces were high throughout with 77.1-87.9% of the samples and 93.8-100% of the farms. Lower Austria had the highest percentage of positive farms, and Vorarlberg the lowest. Individual OPG (oocysts per gram of feces) values were generally low; 75% of the samples had an OPG of 1,000 or less. The highest detected OPG was 72,400. The mean OPG was 2,525 with above average numbers in Tirol, Carinthia, and Lower Austria. The mean OPG values were significantly positively correlated with the cattle density in the different districts. The majority of the samples were from female Simmenthal calves. Clinical coccidiosis (diarrhea) was observed in 74 cases, and (semi-)liquid diarrhea (56 animals) was significantly correlated with OPG (p<0.05). Linear regression on the OPG data showed that OPG values significantly decreased with increasing age of the calves, while the percentage of positive samples increased with age (p<0.05 for both). The term \"coccidia\" was familiar to 45% of the farmers, and anticoccidial treatment was performed by 13.51% of them, most commonly with toltrazuril. Considering the ubiquitous occurrence and the possible clinical and economic relevance of calf eimeriosis, infections should receive increased attention by both farmers and veterinarians.",

            "text": "The occurrence of bovine coccidiosis caused by Eimeria spp. has been reported worldwide. Of the 21 species that are known to occur in cattle (Gr\u00e4fner et al. 1978) , 13 have so far been described for Europe (Joyner et al. 1966) . Most species are considered to have a low pathogenicity, whereas infection with E. bovis or E. zuernii may cause severe disease in calves (Supperer 1971; B\u00fcrger 1983; Daugschies and Najdrowski 2005) . In grazing calves suffering from clinical coccidiosis E. alabamensis was reported as the predominant species (Gr\u00e4fner et al. 1985a; Svensson 2000; von Samson-Himmelstjerna et al. 2006) . Clinical coccidiosis is characterized by watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea as the cardinal symptom (Bangoura et al. 2011) , sometimes with fibrin and intestinal tissue, abdominal pain, fever, tenesm, dehydration, weakness, anorexia and weight loss (Fanta 1967; B\u00fcrger 1983; Daugschies et al. 1986 ). Usually clinical coccidiosis is a result of the interaction of several factors, including age of the animals, the number of ingested oocysts, production systems and management practices, hygienic conditions, stable temperature, season and the level of stress for the animals, which may favour a clinical outbreak of coccidiosis (Gr\u00e4fner et al. 1978; Lassen et al. 2009a; Rehman et al. 2011) . Generally, clinical coccidiosis is a problem in calves from 3 weeks to 12 months of age (Daugschies and Najdrowski 2005) , while in older animals coccidiosis occurs predominantly in a subclinical form, since after repeated contact most animals acquire a protective immunity (Cornelissen et al. 1995) . Susceptible calves usually become infected after they are grouped together or moved to a contaminated enviroment (Hiepe 1978; Joachim 2002) . According to Fox (1985) , clinical signs are often not demonstrated until 3-8 weeks after initial infection, if at all. Furthermore, Fox (1985) claimed that the observation of one clinical case in a group indicates that oocysts are also cycling in other animals of the group. Although most infected calves appear clinically healthy, subclinical infections may result in reduced feed consumption, malnutrition, impaired growth and weight loss. Infectected calves are also more susceptible to secondary diseases, such as pneumonia, bacterial enteritis and viral infections (Fox 1985; Gr\u00e4fner et al. 1985b) . As a consequence, annual economic losses due to both clinical and especially subclinical coccidiosis (Hiepe 1972) were previously estimated to be about US$ 723 million worldwide (Fitzgerald 1980) . Dairy farming is a major part of the agricultural sector in Austria; however, so far only limited information is available about the prevalence, species composition and the geographic distribution of bovine Eimeria infections and their possible impact on animal health and productivity. We therefore conducted an extensive countrywide prevalence study in dairy calves and questioned the farmers with regard to their knowledge on calf coccidiosis and control measures that they carried out.",

The result of the study showed clearly that Eimeria infections are very common amongst cattle farms all over Austria; 97.97% of the examined farms and 83.67% of all samples were positive. A total of 11 Eimeria species could be identified by their morphological appearance: E. bovis, E. ellipsoidalis, E. zuernii, E. auburnensis, E. alabamensis, E. cylindrica, E. canadensis, E. subspherica, E. pellita, E. wyomingensis, E. bukidnonensis. Compared to the findings of Supperer (1952) and Sahliger (1977) , these results represent on the one hand an increase of the number of species found in Austria and on the other hand also indicate an increase in the prevalence of these infections.

According to Hiepe (1983) , these species have the highest reproductive potential, which may be the reason for their frequent occurrence. In accordance with Ernst and coauthors (1984) and Weinandy (1989) , E. bovis was found to be the most prevalent species. Interestingly, samples collected in Carinthia, Salzburg, Burgenland, and Lower and Upper Austria showed a considerably higher prevalence of E. alabamensis compared to the rest of Austria. E. alabamensis is the predominating species in calves on pasture (Svensson 2000; von Samson-Himmelstjerna et al. 2006) , and can also be transmitted via contaminated hay (Svensson 1997) . This increase could be explained with the sampling season rather than the geographic region. In the mentioned provinces, samples were collected during the grazing season (June to October). Although Supperer (1952) and Sahliger (1977) reported the occurrence of E. brasiliensis in Austria, oocysts of this species were not found in this study. E. illinoisensis seems to be absent from Austria as it has never been reported and could not be provided in the present study.",

Dairy cattle husbandry in Austria has an old tradition and important cultural significance. It is mainly maintained in smallholder systems with an average of 10-19 dairy cattle per farm (Grohsebner 2010) . Only 0.5% of the farms have a stock greater than 100 dairy cattle. Due to the small herd sizes the density of animals is generally low, and this may result in low-level infections with subsequently moderate oocyst shedding despite the high prevalence rates.",

For sample distribution, see Table 2 Najdrowski 2005; Stewart et al. 2008). However, the season with the highest prevalence rates vary in different studies. Stewart and coauthors (2008) found a significantly higher prevalence of Eimeria infections during autumn, while Daugschies and Najdrowski (2005) indicated an increase in the prevalence of Eimeria infections during spring. Other authors reported about a significant increase of coccidiosis during the period of wet season in warmer climates (Rehman et al. 2011 ). According to Weinandy (1989) the influence of the climatic conditions on the prevalence of Eimeria spp. is not always clearly demonstratable. The highest mean OPG levels were found in Lower Austria and Tirol. These regions differ greatly geographically and climatically. Samples from Tirol (alpine area, 467-3,797 m above sea level) were collected in March when frost was still present while samples from Lower Austria (lowland to pre-alpine area, 139-2,075 m above sea level) were collected between September and October under sunny conditions. The influence of season vs. geography is therefore not separable.",

            "text": "This study shows that infections with Eimeria spp. are ubiquitous in Austrian dairy cattle at an age of 3 weeks up to 1 year. However, the various factors that may influence the prevalence and intensities, such as farm factors including hygiene, management practices or housing systems, and geographical and climatic conditions cannot be separated and attributed to varying prevalences in the different areas. For sample distribution, see Table 2 Correlations between OPG levels, age and clinical signs OPG levels can vary considerably in different animals during the course of infection (Staschen 2009) , so a single individual sample may not accurately reflect the overall level of oocyst excretion. However, the OPG levels were generally low on average. In many epidemiological studies about bovine coccidiosis clinical cases have been reported rarely or not at all (Cornelissen et al. 1995; Matjila and Penzhorn 2002; Cicek et al. 2007 ). It can be assumed that coccidiosis mostly occurs in a subclinical form. In the present study, clinical coccidiosis with the main feature of diarrhea was observed in 74 cases (8.5%). There was a significant difference in the average OPG values between calves with formed feces and calves with semi-fluid to fluid feces. However, OPG values from calves suffering from watery diarrhea were not significantly higher than those from calves appearing healthy. Daugschies and Najdrowski (2005) also reported that the amount of oocysts shed is not closely correlated to the severity of coccidiosis. In contrast, found a positive correlation between quantified oocyst excretion and fecal consistency in an experimental E. zuernii infection in calves. They also mentioned that the infection dose has a marked influence on the extent of clinical symptoms. Furthermore, a significant reduction of the OPG level with increasing age of the calves was seen, which was also reported by other authors (Cornelissen et al. 1995; Matjila and Penzhorn 2002; Cicek et al. 2007; Rehman et al. 2011 ) and can be explained with the development of protective immunity due to previous contact with the parasite (Senger et al. 1959; Fitzgerald 1967; Daugschies et al. 1986 ). By contrast, the percentage of Eimeria-positive animals increased with increasing age of the calves. These two findings lead to the conclusion that on the one hand young calves are able to develop a sufficient immune response to avoid a clinical outbreak of coccidiosis after reinfection; on the other hand, this protective immunity is not able to displace the pathogen completely. It therefore has to be considered that older, clinically healthy, immune animals may be responsible for the distribution of oocysts and that these may lead to heavy outbreaks of clinical coccidiosis in susceptible individuals (Gr\u00e4fner et al. 1985b) .",

            "text": "The statements of the farmers about the occurrence of diarrhea in calves showed clearly that the majority of them were not familiar with the possible impact of coccidiosis on animal health. This is also reflected in the low number of farmers who already performed anticoccidial treatment. On the other hand, this may be due to the fact that coccidiosis usually occurs in a subclinical form. Only in very few cases metaphylactic treatment was performed to reduce the prevalence of coccidiosis, and as with therapeutic treatment it was usually only applied to individual calves. Sporadic treatment, however, is not recommended since it does not efficiently reduce the environmental contamination with oocysts and thus the risk of parasite transmission ). According to Staschen (2009) , prerequisites for determining the time point for treatment is a precise diagnosis and an insufficient understanding of the specific epidemiological conditions within a livestock operation. These findings underline how important it is to familiarize farmers and veterinarians with the possible economic impact of bovine coccidiosis. Interestingly, Bangoura et al. (2011) reported a similar situation about the awareness of bovine coccidiosis in Germany. Although their results showed clearly that coccidiosis must be considered as a ubiquitous problem in Germany in shed-raised calves which affects almost all examined facilities to varying degrees, regardless of size, comparatively few farms established targeted control strategies. The economic losses due coccidiosis, especially subclinical coccidiosis (Fitzgerald 1980; Fox 1985) , should be a motivation to introduce special hygienic measures and metaphylatic medication on affected cattle farms to establish and maintain a healthy livestock. Frequently, educational work by the veterinarians about the impact of coccidiosis and its prevention is necessary to establish an effective control regime. The efficacy of toltrazuril against infections with Eimeria spp. was shown in various studies (Bohrmann 1991; Mundt et al. 2003 Mundt et al. , 2005 Epe et al. 2005; Jonsson et al. 2011) . The additional costs for treatment are justified for all farms with a diagnosed problem of coccidiosis and for farmers who are focused on raising profitable and healthy dairy calves for progeny. According to Fox (1978) , a calf which suffered from a clinical form of coccidiosis will never become profitable. A long-term survey about dairy calves affected by clinical coccidiosis and their future development of fertility and milk yield would be of interest to investigate the actual effect of coccidiosis.",
