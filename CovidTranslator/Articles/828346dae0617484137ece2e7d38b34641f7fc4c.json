This paper further investigates the effects of industry characteristics on the energy-saving target by applying the four-stage DEA proposed by Fried et al. (1999) . We also calculate the pre-adjusted and environment-adjusted total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores in these service sectors. There are three inputs (labor, capital stock, and energy consumption) and a single output (real GDP) in the DEA model. The most energy efficient service sector is finance, insurance and real estate, which has an average TFEE of 0.994 and an environment-adjusted TFEE (EATFEE) of 0.807. The study utilizes the panel-data, random-effects Tobit regression model with the energy-saving target (EST) as the dependent variable. Those service industries with a larger GDP output have greater excess use of energy. The capital-labor ratio has a significantly positive effect while the time trend variable has a significantly negative impact on the EST, suggesting that future new capital investment should also be accompanied with energy-saving technology in the service sectors.",

            "text": "Because Taiwan is a small open and developing economy, it relies heavily on overseas supplies for its energy needs, and as a result the international economic environment has continuously impacted the country's energy prices. For example, in 2010 the percentage of Taiwan's imported energy accounted for 99.4% of total energy supplies, in contrast to 0.6% of indigenous energy, with total energy supplies in Taiwan hitting 145,561 thousands of kiloliter of oil equivalent (KLOE). In the same year, Taiwan's total energy domestic consumption achieved a record high of 120,308 thousands of KLOE (Energy Statistics, 2012) . Saving energy has thus become an extremely important issue in Taiwan, with existing research studies addressing energy efficiency or productivity on the region level or country level (for example Bian and Yang (2010) , Greening et al. (1997) , Guo et al. (2011) , Hu (2008, 2011) , Howarth et al. (1991) , Hu and Kao (2007) , Shi et al. (2010) , Worrell et al. (1997) ). Some researches focused on the fossil fuel power plants with considering the undesirable outputs (Sueyoshi and Goto, 2012) . Furthermore, the capital-labor ratio as the proxy of technology level is one of the important indicators in Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/enpol Energy Policy the energy economics. Wu (2012) proposed that the capital-labor ratio reduces inefficient energy use, because new capital utilizes energy-saving technology. However, Blomberg et al. (2012) indicated that even bigger companies with high capital in Sweden might have challenges to improving energy efficiency because of possible risks for production disruptions and the associated costs. However, there is a paucity of research investigating the energy issue in the service sectors as well as the impact of the capital-labor ratio toward the energy efficiency even though the relative share of services in total gross domestic production (GDP) has been increasing and accounts for nearly 70% in Taiwan. Especially, the growth rate of energy consumption in the service sectors from 2001 to 2008 is 20.44% in contrast to the 19.67% as of the industrial sectors in Taiwan. Hence, this paper's objective is to bridge the gap in the literature by measuring the energy efficiency for different subsectors under the service aggregation sectors in Taiwan and to validate the hypothesis of the impact of capital-labor ratio on the energy efficiency in the service sectors. Ang (2006) defined that energy efficiency is a relative concept. Hu and Wang (2006) indicated that other inputs (for example, labor and capital) together with energy consumption ought to be considered in assessing the energy efficiency. Furthermore, Hu and Wang (2006) developed the index of total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) to analyze energy efficiencies of 29 administrative regions in China during 1995-2002. Their paper employed data envelopment analysis (DEA), using labor, capital stock, energy consumption, and total sown area of farm crops as the four inputs and real GDP as the single output in order to find the target energy input of each region in China for each particular year. A U-shape relation between an area's TFEE and per capita income in the areas of China empirically confirms the scenario that energy efficiency eventually improves with economic growth. Hu and Kao (2007) further used constant-returns-to-scale (CRS) DEA by incorporating three inputs (energy, labor, and capital) and a single output (GDP) to establish the energy-saving target (EST) and then measured energy-saving target ratios (ESTRs) for 17 APEC economies during 1991-2000. The empirical results indicate a U-shape relation between per capita EST and per capita GDP. ESTR has a positive relation with the value-added percentage of GDP of the industry sectors and a negative relation with that of the service sectors.",

            "text": "Researchers have also focused on energy efficiency in the energy and manufacturing sectors (for example Blomberg et al. (2012) ), though few studies have looked at the energy efficiency of specific industrial sectors. Gouyette and Perelman (1997) took input-oriented DEA and the Malmquist index, including GDP as the single output and labor and capital inventory as two inputs, to measure efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing and service sectors for 13 OECD countries over the 1970-1987 period. The results indicate that the productivity of the service sectors in OECD countries slightly increased, which is mostly caused by an increase in efficiency change. Boyd and Pang (2000) examined the differences in plant-level electricity and fossil fuel intensity in the glass industry. Productivity differences between plants are statistically significant in explaining differences in plant energy intensity. Productivity has a significantly positive impact on the energy efficiency for flat glass, but not for container glass. Honma and Hu (2013) used DEA with the assumption of variable-return-to-scale (VRS) by incorporating three inputs (energy consumption, labor, and capital stock) and a single output (the value added in each sector) to estimate the TFEE of 17 sectors in Japan during 1998-2005. The empirical result presents that the TFEE is relatively higher in the mining, general machinery, real estate and housing service, and the financial and insurance and service sectors in Japan, in contrast to the relatively lower energy intensity for the agricultural sector, as well as the transportation and communication sector. Honma and Hu (2011) further computed and analyzed the TFEE of 11 industries in 14 developed countries during 1995-2005 using the DEA approach and by considering four inputs (labor, capital stock, intermediate inputs other than energy, and energy) and one output (the value added). The most inefficient industry is the metal industry, with an average TFEE of 40.6%. The results also identify the most efficient countries in each different time period of 1995 of -1998 of , 1999 of -2002 of , and 2003 of -2005 of . Shi et al. (2010 also used fixed asset, energy consumption, and labor as the inputs of the DEA model to assess the efficiency of 28 different regions in China.",

EI stands for the energy consumption for producing every unit of real GDP within a certain time frame. Renshaw (1981) and Patterson (1996) suggested that EI considers only partial factors of energy consumption without embracing capital and labor factors. Another critic noted that this partial factor index is inappropriate for investigating the impact of changing energy use over time (Asia Pacific Energy Research Center (APERC), 2002). Hence, the objective of this paper is three-fold. First, this paper analyzes the pure technical efficiency (PTE) and assesses the energy-saving target of Taiwan's service sectors by employing VRS-DEA. Second, the paper computes the energy-saving target ratio and TFEE for each service subsector developed by Hu and Wang (2006) . Third, this study further investigates the effects of industry characteristics on the energy-saving target by applying the four-stage DEA proposed by Fried et al. (1999) . We also calculate the pre-adjusted and environment-adjusted totalfactor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores in these service sectors.",

The financial service sector has been apparently continuous working on business process reengineering (BPR). The financial holding companies established since 2002 have also created capital efficiency in the financial service sector. The transportation and storage sector has the second highest efficiency score among these four service sectors over the period 2001-2008. The wholesale and retail trade sector obtains the lowest efficiency in the service sectors during 2001-2008. This result indicates that the financial service and transportation and storage sectors have a competitive capability for using less capital, labor, and energy to yield a certain GDP. From the statistics of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the Executive Yuan in Taiwan, total employment in the wholesale and retail trade sector is the highest among the service sectors, accounting for 1.77 million persons (17%), in contrast to 0.69 million persons (6.6%) in the lodging and catering sector, and 74,000 persons (0.7%) in the real estate sector. This finding shows that the wholesale and retail trade sector needs much improvement in the input of resources, especially on labor savings. The PTE of the lodging and catering sector obviously deceases after 2003. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 weakened Taiwan's economy as well as its tourism industry. This event also proved that the slowdown in the economy had a great impact on lodging and catering businesses.",

Honma and Hu (2013) also indicated that the financial and insurance sector has the high level TFEE in Japan. They pointed out that the tertiary industries, except for the transportation and communication sector, have higher TFEE scores in Japan, which is consistent with this paper's finding. The government needs to develop financial service businesses to yield a relatively higher GDP under the given labor and energy. Weber (2005) further indicated that banks have pursued cost saving effects by reducing their consumption of energy, water, and resource materials. Banks also have demonstrated their environmental strategy of 'going for green' to attract more customers. The TFEE in the wholesale and retail trade sector dramatically increases to a record high in 2008. The 3R (recycling, reuse, and refill) policy in Taiwan has resulted in obvious progress in the wholesale and retail trade sector. The popular recycle containers in hypermarkets have helped promote the concept of energy conservation, while the severe price-cutting competition among wholesalers and retailers in Taiwan have also indirectly had a positive impact on the energy-saving action.",

            "text": "Several findings can be drawn from the estimation results of the random-effects Tobit regression. A GDP share variable has a significantly positive effect on the EST, which indicates that those service industries with more GDP output have greater excess use of energy. The capital-labor ratio also has a significantly positive effect on the EST, which is not consistent with Wu's findings on regions in China. This may be because more high-tech service industries in Taiwan use more energy-consuming facilities that are not so energy-efficient. Blomberg et al. (2012) also indicate that even bigger companies in Sweden may face significant barriers to improving energy efficiency because of possible risks for production disruptions and the associated costs. Meanwhile, the medium sized companies also have the lower priority to increase the capital turnover in order to address on the energy efficiency issue (Blomberg et al., 2012) . Therefore, the service industries in Taiwan should pay attention to energy efficiency of newly acquired facilities. A time trend variable has a significantly negative impact on the EST and indicates less excess use of energy over 2001-2008 among the service industries in Taiwan. Table 5 compares the TFEE and environment-adjusted TFEE (EATFEE) for the individual services industry in Taiwan. Fig. 1 indicates the comparisons of TFEE and EATFEE for the wholesale and retail trade sector during 2001-2008. The graph illustrates that the EATFEE and TFEE have a similar increasing pattern for this sector, with the EATFEE obviously higher than the TFEE after incorporating the industrial characteristics. The GDP real growth finding suggests that there is much room for energy-saving improvement among wholesalers and retailers after incorporating the unfavorable factors (GDP, energy consumption, capital-labor ratio) compared to capital and labor. Hence, this finding also offers a recommendation for wholesale and retail trade to keep up their cost savings through energy-saving actions even though there is a significant movement toward the efficient frontier for the TFEE and EATFEE in 2008. Fig. 2 illustrates the comparisons of TFEE and EATFEE in the transportation and storage sector. The empirical results reveal a worsening trend in TFEE in this sector over 2005-2008. As a result of controlling for the industrial characteristics, the EATFEE has decreased in the sector since 2003 and indicates that without controlling for the industrial difference, the penalty to this sector operating under favorable factors is less than the benefit to this sector operating under favorable industrial characteristics. These favorable environments (less energy consumption and lower capital-labor ratio in the transportation and storage sector) provide much benefit for the TFEE of this sector. Fig. 3 illustrates that the TFEE and EATFEE in the lodging and catering sector have a decreasing trend in the 2003-2008 period. During the same period, the TFEE and EATFEE in this sector present a similar pattern with the transportation and storage sector. These favorable environments (less energy consumption and lower capital-labor ratio in the lodging and catering sector) Note: TFEE and EATFEE stand for total factor of energy efficiency and environment-adjusted energy efficiency, respectively. provide much benefit for the TFEE of this sector. Even though Taiwan's environmental law has restricted the use of nonwashable dining utensils in restaurants since 2006, which possibly led to the slightly drop for the TFEE and EATFEE in the sector of lodging and catering. This finding shows that energy efficiency also needs improvement in the lodging and catering sector. Fig. 4 shows the trend of TFEE and EATFEE in the financial service sector in the 2001-2008 periods. The results show that TFEE and EATFEE hit the efficient frontier in the financial service sector during 2006-2007. The comprehensive conclusion in the National Energy Conference in 2005 alleged that the energy service company (ESCO) establishment in Taiwan had led the energy efficiency improvement for the peripheral banking and leasing business because of the increasing loan amounts for procurements of energy-saving equipment since 2005. Aside from the synergy creation in financial holding companies since 2003, merger and acquisition activities in this sector have also promoted cost savings, capital efficiency, and cross selling to yield overall efficiency. The unfavorable industrial characteristics (second highest GDP share, second highest capital-labor ratio) benefit the TFEE in this sector.",

The PTE of two sectors (the finance, insurance and real estate sector and the transportation and storage sector) is higher than that of the other two sectors. The financial service sector has been dramatically working on BPR and organizational reshuffling in order to establish financial holding companies or push mergers among financial institutions, causing consolidation synergy to gradually appear. The empirical result also indicates that TFEE and EATFEE of the finance, insurance and real estate sector have the highest score among all service sectors during 2001-2008. Both the wave of mergers and acquisitions and the establishment of financial holding companies during 2002-2004 helped motivate energy efficiency in the financial service arena. This result also confirms that 3C (cross-selling, capital-efficiency, and cost-saving) synergy in the financial service sector was created, because financial holding companies were established. At the same time, the financial institutions pursued cost savings effects by reducing their consumption of energy, water, and materials and demonstrated their environmental strategy of 'going for green' in order to attract more customers (Weber, 2005) .",

In fact, Taiwan's indigenous energy supply has fallen so much that it has only accounted for less than 1% of total energy supply since 2003 (Energy Statistics, Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs) in contrast to more than 99% of energy supply being imported. Policy makers should pay more attention to those service sectors with poor energy efficiency. For example, the Taiwan Tourism Bureau (TTB) could offer incentives for green hotels or green restaurants in order to improve energy efficiency in the catering and lodging sector. The TTB could further combine 'green' criteria into the on-going hotel star-rating system. Taiwan's government should encourage restaurateurs to measure, list, and mitigate their carbon footprint on each menu item. Even though Taiwan government alleges main six promotions for energy saving: \"(1) Promote energy saving light bulb; (2) Apply thermostat timer on water dispenser and water fountain machine; (3) Set up one degree more for the temperature in summer time and clean the filter; (4) Be sure to power off the computer, instead of idling for a while; (5) Promote unplugging the electric appliance; (6) Promote turning off the light for an hour during lunch break for governmental and regular business office buildings (Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs),\" offering financial incentives to use solar water heaters, green furniture, and other energy-saving equipment in the service sectors could also enhance energy efficiency through electricity, gas, and other energy-saving plans.",
