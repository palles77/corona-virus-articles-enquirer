This method is based on the binding of RNA to acid-treated glass beads in the presence of a high molarity of guanidinium salt. It can be completed within an hour, and obviates the need for dewaxing and phenol/chloroform extractions. The effect of various fixatives and fixation times was tested and the amplification of actin mRNA fragments ranging in length from 82 to 507 bp was used to demonstrate the presence of RNA in the extracts. The method was compared to existing extraction techniques by studying the quality of the templates for rcvcrsetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR), using virusinfected and mock-infected paraffin-embedded cell pellets as a model. PCR amplification of cellular and viral RNA was successful for RNA isolated by use of all extraction techniques. although the glass bead method was preferred for its simplicity and rapidity. Specimens fixed with formalin were found to be suitable for PCR, but the best results wcrc obtained with acetone-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Dewaxing of tissue sections had no effect on the yield and quality of RNA extractions, and further purification of the extracts using gel filtration did not improve the results. After the protocols were optimized.",

            "text": "In pathology the analysis of RNA by molecular methods is often hampered by the lack of fresh material, making diagnostic and retrospective studies difficult, if not impossible. Pathology departments accumulate large numbers of paraffin-embedded tissues, dating back many years. The extraction of DNA from such specimens for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis has been well documented (Forsthoevel et al., 1992; Greer et al., 1991; Cuzick et al., 1992; Heller et al., 1991; Jackson et al., 1990; Lai-Goldman et al., 1988) . However, relatively little is known about the application of reversetranscriptase (RT)-PCR to detect cellular or viral RNA in paraffin-embedded tissue and about the influence of different fixatives on RT-PCR (Redline et al., 1991; Rupp and Locker, 1988; Stanta and Schneider, 1991) . A previously described glass bead method that we used for RNA extraction from stools (Boom et al., 1990; Koopmans et al., 1991b) was modilied and used to extract RNA from paraffin-embedded specimens. This method was compared to existing methods (Rupp and Locker, 1988; Stanta and Schneider, 1991) . In doing so, the practical limitations of these approaches were addressed. We studied the effect of Gxatives and RNA extraction technique on subsequent PCR in an in vitro system. Toroviruses provided a good model system, because:",

For this comparison we extracted sections from paraffin-embedded cell pellets that had been fixed for different times in different fixatives. Extraction protocols A and B and the glass bead extraction method were used, and RT-PCR amplification was done using primer pairs toro l/2 (3-end), 3/4 (pol; . Table 2a ), actin l/3 (82 bp), l/4 (249 bp) and l/.5 (507 bp; Table 2b ). For the torovirus RT-PCRs, less template and a lower number of cycles (30) were used than in the comparison of extraction methods described above (40 cycles) in order to detect differences in efficiency of extraction and RT-PCR. When using the 3'-end torovirus primers (l/2) under these conditions, most consistent results were obtained with extraction protocol B (Table 2a) , which yielded amplifiable RNA from cell pellets for all tixations except 5 months formalin prior to embedding. It is noteworthy that we were able to amplify an 82 bp jj-actin RNA fragment from the latter tissue (primers actin 1 and 2; Table 2b ). For materials fixed in Carnoy's fluid, only protocol B gave positive RT-PCR results with both torovirus primer pairs (Table 2a) . With the polymerase primers, toro 3 and 4, the results were similar but the intensity of the DNA bands was less for 4 of the 14 extracts that gave positive results. To compare the sensitivities of the 2 torovirus specific primer pairs, we tested RNA extracts from serially diluted cell-culture grown BEV, showing that the 3'-end primers detected 10 and the polymerase primers lo2 TCIDSO (not shown). No bands were obtained when coronavirus RNA was used as a template.",

Even though the size of the torovirus amplicons was 231 for the 3'-end primers and 235 for the polymerase primers, the similar size (249 bp) product of the actin RT-PCR (primers actin 1 and 3) was only seen in 4 of the 13 extracts that were positive with both torovirus primers.

RT-PCR amplification of actin RNA using primers 1 and 3 (82 bp product) was a certain indication of the presence of amplifiable RNA in the extracts but was more sensitive than the torovirus-specific RT-PCRs (Tables 2a  and b) . Interestingly, a 249 bp actin-specific amplicon was only obtained in 2 of the 13 extracts that were positive in both torovirus RT-PCRs giving a similar size product.

With all protocols, acetone fixation clearly gave the best quality and quantity of RNA template. Neutral buffered formalin, which is the most commonly used fixative, did result in sufficient RNA, but fixation time and extraction method were important. After 6 or 24 h of fixation, intact RNA could be obtained, whereas after 5 months, only weak bands were seen after amplification with the primer pair giving the smallest size amplicon (actin 1 and 3; 82 bp). We have used varying times of fixation outside of this study and had similar results up to 1 wk of fixation before embedding, with decreasing RNA yields thereafter. These results are in agreement with those of Rupp and Locker (1988) who used Northern blot hybridizations to demonstrate progressive degradation of RNA in tissues fixed and stored in NBF. Singer et al. (1986) found bottled formalin solutions to be unpredictable in their effect on RNA retention in tissues to be tested by in situ hybridization. They also showed that excellent RNA retention was obtained with a mercury fixative similar to B-5, in agreement with our findings, and PFA. Acetone was not used in their study, and it would be interesting to test whether acetone-fixed material is equally suited for in situ hybridization and PCR. The successful amplitication of rotaviral and toroviral RNA from archival specimens confirmed the results obtained in the model system and demonstrated the clinical applicability. The torovirus RT-PCR results correlated well with the findings in a study by Fagerland et al. (1986) who found numerous torovirus-infected cells in the intestinal epithelium of the posterior jejunum (which tested positive by RT-PCR) and not in the anterior jejunum, which was negative when tested by RT-PCR. The importance of the fixative used, however, is clearly demonstrated by the difference in intensity of the RT-PCR products from extracts of formalin-fixed and acetone-fixed material.",
