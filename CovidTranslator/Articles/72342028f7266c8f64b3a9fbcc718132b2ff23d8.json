However, little is known about the disease burden and the molecular epidemiology of HAdV. Objectives: To retrospectively perform a molecular characterization of HAdV positive samples received at Statens Serum Institut during the period 2011-2016 and to compare this with demographic information, geographic location, sample collection date and type and co-infection with other viral pathogens. Study design: 152 HAdV positive samples were genotyped by Sanger sequencing of a fragment of the hexon gene using published primers along with a newly developed primer set for enhanced genotyping of HAdV D. Phylogenetic analysis was used for genotyping and genotypes were compared with epidemiological information. In addition, HAdV burden and co-infection was evaluated for samples tested in laboratory analysis packages. Results: Six out of seven HAdV species were identified and represented by 13 types. Young children (< 5 years old) were more likely to be positive for HAdV and co-infections with other gastrointestinal or respiratory viruses were common. Possible outbreaks of ocular infections due to HAdV D could not be confirmed. Conclusion: A diverse set of HAdV species were circulating in Denmark in the study period and although possible transmission clusters were identified, this could not be verified with current genotyping methods Young children were commonly affected by HAdV infection and co-infections with other viral pathogens were frequent suggesting a possible underestimation of the real HAdV burden.",

HAdV typing is performed by PCR amplification and sequencing of a hypervariable region of the hexon gene, coding for one of three HAdV capsid proteins. HAdV can cause a wide range of diseases, namely febrile respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea and more rarely haemorrhagic cystitis and meningitis. Recent studies identified HAdV among 6% to 20% of hospitalised or emergency room admitted children [3] [4] [5] [6] presenting with lower respiratory tract infections and 10% and 23% of children admitted with acute gastroenteritis [7, 8] . HAdV species have been associated with different clinical manifestations [9] : gastroenteritis with HAdV species F, keratoconjunctivitis with species D and respiratory disease with species C and E. Species A and B (type 1) have been associated with gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, and keratoconjunctivitis. In particular, HAdV-B7 has been associated with severe respiratory disease [5, 10] .",

Non-symptomatic infected individuals can keep emitting viral particles in the environment for weeks through their feces, notably species B and C [11] [12] [13] . HAdVs are non-enveloped viruses, which make them more resistant to lipid disinfectants and provide them with a prolonged capacity to survive in the environment [14, 15] . All these factors contribute to the outbreak potential of HAdVs. The potential for outbreaks of respiratory disease has led to the development of a vaccine to be used among US military recruits [16, 17] .",

No difference in sex distribution was observed between HAdV positive and negative individuals across all sample types, except for a higher proportion of HAdV positive eye samples from males ( Table 1 ). The median age of HAdV positive individuals was lower than that of HAdV negative individuals across the different sample types. In particular, the median age of HAdV positive patients was 1.5 years for those who had a feces specimen tested and 3.5 years old for those who had a respiratory specimen tested. Overall children < 5 years old were 5 (95% CI = 4.3-7.6) and 15 (95% CI = 7.0-33.9) times more likely to be tested positive for HAdV, in respiratory and feces samples respectively, than other individuals in this sample set.",

For this analysis, we limited the sample set to the samples which were tested simultaneously in laboratory analysis packages including both HAdV and a defined set of respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses. This approach was taken in order to limit potential biases (overestimation of HAdV prevalence) in samples that would have been tested only for HAdV. The sample set comprised 5858 feces samples and 1784 respiratory samples. In respiratory specimens, the package consisted of Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza, Metapneumovirus, Coronavirus and Parechovirus. In the feces samples, viruses included in the laboratory analysis package were Norovirus GGI and GGII, Rotavirus, Sapovirus and Astrovirus. Overall the estimated prevalence of HAdV infections in the selected sample set was low at 0.9% (n = 54) and 3.5% (n = 62) among feces and respiratory specimens, respectively. Norovirus was the most frequently detected viral pathogen in feces specimens and Rhinovirus-Enterovirus in respiratory specimens (Table 3a and b).

This improved the typing resolution and allowed classification of 47 of the 50 sequences into six genotypes. Type 56 and 37 were identified in samples from all regions (but Faroe Islands and Greenland), in the years spanning 2012-2016 and 2012-2015, respectively.

Clusters of two to three HAdV type 8 sequences (Fig. 3) were investigated for potential outbreaks as samples originated from the same location and were collected less than 30 days apart. However, phylogenetic analyses of the long hexon sequences from these samples did not permit for discrimination between them and other HAdV type 8 sequences with different temporal or geographical origins.

Type 41 was the most common species F strain circulating in Denmark. Of the six types belonging to species D, five types were identified in Denmark, and one additional type was identified in samples from the Faroe Islands. Sequencing a longer fragment of the hexon gene improved the classification of HAdV D from to type level for a total of 142 of 152 (93%) samples. To perform typing of HAdV it would therefore be advisable to have species specific primers for typing of some HAdV species after an initial and broad screening is performed with the primers capable of detecting all species. We here provide such additional primers for HAdV D.",

Species D type 8, identified in this study, has previously been associated with outbreaks of keratoconjunctivitis [22, 23] . It was therefore investigated if possible outbreaks could be observed in the study period through a combined phylogenetic, geographical and temporal clustering. Although geographical and partial temporal clustering of type 8 was observed and indicated a possible outbreak on Zealand in 2013 the phylogenetic resolution, even with the larger hexon gene fragment, was not high enough for a clear distinction between sequences from Zealand in 2013 and other type 8 sequences with different geographical and temporal origins. Therefore larger parts or whole genome sequencing approaches might be required to differentiate between sequences originating from an outbreak and sporadic cases. Since HAdVs genome consists of dsDNA, it might also be far less variable than other (ssRNA) viruses, for instance norovirus, where molecular methods are commonly used to identify point-source outbreaks [24, 25] . Systematic surveillance and reporting of HAdV infections and virus genotyping would provide critical information on HAdV types commonly in circulation and their genetic diversity and also allow for the identification of clusters of infections likely to be outbreaks.",

In Scotland, HAdV surveillance is done as part of a routine respiratory screen both from hospital samples all year-round and from general practitioner samples during the influenza season as part of the sentinel swabbing scheme for influenza-like illness. In Germany, the surveillance system only covers epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. These surveillance systems mainly rely on existing infrastructure but have enabled countries to monitor trends and also, in the example of Germany, to investigate outbreaks [26] .
