We describe the organization and results of the network, known as ECMOnet. Methods: The network consisted of 14 ICUs with ECMO capability and a national call center. The network was set up to centralize all severe patients to the ECMOnet centers assuring safe transfer. An ad hoc committee defined criteria for both patient transfer and ECMO institutions. Results: Between August 2009 and March 2010, 153 critically ill patients (53% referred from other hospitals) were admitted to the ECMOnet ICU with suspected H1N1. Sixty patients (48 of the referred patients, 49 with confirmed H1N1 diagnosis) received ECMO according to ECMOnet criteria. All referred patients were successfully transferred to the ECM-Onet centers; 28 were transferred while on ECMO. Survival to hospital discharge in patients receiving ECMO was 68%. Survival of patients receiving ECMO within 7 days from",

There are limited data on outcomes in patients who qualified for ECMO support but did not receive it. For this reason we do not have enough information to estimate an expected mortality against which we could compare our results. To our knowledge, the Argentinian report is the only study stratifying mortality according to PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio [8] . It reported a 67% mortality in patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \\ 100 mmHg. These patients received rescue therapies with a frequency similar to that in our study but did not receive ECMO treatment. The Italian Group for the Evaluation of Interventions in Intensive care Medicine (GiViTi) prospectively collected data from 152 Italian ICUs on H1N1 patients. The GiViTi H1N1 database included 45 mechanically ventilated ARDS patients whose lowest PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was \\100 mmHg but did not receive ECMO. Mortality at hospital discharge in this group was 45% (data by GiViTi following formal application to the GiViTi Coordination Center).",

All our patients transported on ECMO were successfully transferred to the ECMO centers with no reported complications. Survival rate in these patients was 81%, supporting the effectiveness of ECMO in providing safe transportation of patients with severe respiratory failure. In the CESAR trial 22 of the 90 patients initially allocated to the ECMO group did not receive ECMO because they improved with conventional treatment once at the ECMO center[15]. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the patients transported with ECMO might not have needed ECMO if treated from the beginning with other rescue therapies at the referral centers, where more therapeutic options were available. However, most of these patients were considered to be not safely transportable without ECMO.Limitations of the studyAlthough the activity of the ECMOnet covered all of the Italian territory, a limited number of ECMO treatments were performed in centers outside the network and are not included in this report. The institution and funding of the ECMOnet was communicated officially by the Italian Ministry of Health to all Italian hospitals, but access to it was not compulsory. Thus, the study population does not include all ECMO treatments, nor all potentially eligible patients in Italy during the H1N1 pandemic.",
