            "text": "Consider the dynamic interplay between basic reproductive rates (Ro) for pathogens and the percent of the population that must be immunized to control illness [50] . Ro is representative of the contagion potential, the human to human communicability, or the average number of persons who become infected by a single source. Put another way, it represents secondary transmission from one case. For example the transmission rate of Measles (Ro) is estimated at 12 -18, i.e. the number of persons expected to become sick after contact with that one infected patient. Pertusis, another respiratory pathogen has caused local outbreaks, sharing a similar Ro with Measles of 12 -17. To optimize herd immunity, a community must have at between 83 -94% vaccinated against measles, and 92 -94% vaccinated against Pertusis, to limit spread. Although some have suggested the Ro of measles to be less in the post vaccination era for developing countries, the fact remains that it is still a highly contagious pathogen, and requires continued high vaccine rates for effective control. Developing countries continue to have lower than necessary vaccine rates; travelers from such regions can therefore pose a health risk if infected. [50] Other contributors to communicable disease spread include inability to adequately control vectorsespecially mosquitoes and ticks which have expanded their regions of influence, and with that, the ability to spread a variety of pathogens. Of note US mosquitoes are more than capable of spreading Dengue (Image 3), and other dangerous microbes. Notably if cases are identified in a region, they pose a threat as a source for mosquitoes to further spread the infection.",

A recent visit to a medical center revealed how suboptimal are efforts at infection control, where hand sanitizers, masks and instructions on basic hygiene practices were difficult to find, and when available, poorly placed. Clearly there is a need to develop the culture of infection control. Cohorting contagious patients from injured or non-infectious persons should not be a Herculean task in 21 st century healthcare. Can we not do better than inadequately following up with persons ill with pathogens that if undertreated, could lead to antimicrobial resistance as well as outbreaks in an era of computerization? Lack of resources to clean hospital rooms, and other health care facility associated issues such as catheters, test equipment, curtain/bed contamination, and antimicrobial resistance all contribute to infection spread. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 1 in 25 hospitalized patients has a healthcare-associated infection [24] .",

They recently published a study designed to assess the performance of 50 states and Washington, DC based upon 10 indicators that relate to the treatment/prevention of infectious diseases (including HIV, influenza, and pertusis). TFAH relied upon publicly available and government data to examine the emergence and reemergence of specific infectious diseases. The results are not inspiring. Based on a scale of 1 to 10with 10 being the highest positive rankingthe majority of states earned a score of 5 or lower. New Hampshire earned the highest score -8. Georgia, Nebraska and New Jersey were ranked at the bottom with a score of 3. Of additional concern, more than 2 million American children under 3 years of age do not receive all of the vaccinations recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services, and at risk for whooping cough and measles. Not surprisingly both illnesses have reemerged in the last few years. Not to put too fine a point on this, but according to the TFAH study, only two states -Connecticut and Delaware -met the recommended requirement of fully vaccinating 90 percent of children ages 19 months to 35 months.",

Not only does this pertain to immigrants, vacationers, and business travelers, but also our returning military.
