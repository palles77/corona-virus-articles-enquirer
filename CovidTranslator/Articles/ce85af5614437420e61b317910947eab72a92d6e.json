However, a substantial number of membrane lipids can adopt bilayered nonlamellar phases such as hexagonal and cubic phases in water-lipid system. With the advent of electron microscopy (EM), membrane morphologies resembling cubic phases have been reported for a great assortment of organelles [1, 2] . Until recently, the interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) structures observed in the two-dimensional (2D) TEM micrographs was challenging. Propitiously, Landh [3] managed to develop the method of direct template correlative (DTC) matching, a technique that can assess the presence of highly organized membrane organizations (specifically, cubic membranes) in biological specimens. DTC has revealed the abundance of cellular cubic membranes in TEM micrographs ranging from protozoa to human cells [3, 4] , in the mitochondria of amoeba [5] , and more recently, in subcellular membrane compartments associated with cellular stress and viral infection [6] . The development of EM tomography has abetted the analysis of cubic membranes by allowing the confirmation of cubic structures in subcellular organells of living organisms [7] .",

Among these nonlamellar lipid mesophases, cubic phases attract great attention because of their unique feature of 3D periodicity. The type of surface symmetry of bicontinuous cubic phases based on triply periodic minimal surfaces may change, for instance, depending on the water content, pH, electrolytes concentration in the media, and the temperature, giving rise to various subtypes of cubic structures. At least seven cubic phases have been identified in water-lipid system [11] . In living systems, so far only three surface families have been identified to exist, and these three types of cubic membranes are schematically shown in Fig. 1 (D-F). They are designated according to their corresponding triply periodic minimal (or level) surfaces as gyroid (G), double diamond (D), or primitive (P) types of symmetry [4, [13] [14] [15] . However, other cubic membrane symmetries might exist in living systems. These highly curved 3D periodic (n)-parallel membrane bilayers representing \"infinite periodic minimal surfaces\" [16] divide space into (n \u00fe 1) independent aqueous subcompartments.",

In vitro studies using monoolein membranes containing negatively charged dioleoylphosphatidic acid have shown that the electrostatic interactions caused by surface charge of the membranes [17] , charged 2\u00fe short peptides such as poly-L-lysine [18] , Ca concentration [19] , and low pH [20] play important role in the phase transition between lamellar and cubic phases as well as on the stability of cubic phases. Likewise, the weak molecular interactions, for example, by membrane proteins, may lead to transformation of Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane from lamellar into cubic in mammalian cells suggesting that electrostatic interactions may play an important role in that process [18, 21] . In a recent experimental study on the effects of divalent cations in the isolation buffers for mitochondria, we were able to demonstrate that the presence of high concentration of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) up to 10 mM preserved mitochondrial cubic membranes in vitro (manuscript in preparation). As the pH, temperature, and the nature and the concentration of the electrolytes in the cellular milieu are relatively constant, it is likely that the composition and the weak molecular interactions between the membrane components (mainly lipids and proteins) are the essential factors affecting cubic membrane morphology and integrity in vivo. It is important to note that the asymmetry of biological membranes with respect to the two leaflets is also likely to affect cubic membrane formation, in particular as a consequence of lipid and protein composition, and their interaction with different internal and external ion milieu of the membrane-bound organelles.",

It has been argued that the latter must control the morphology of the cubic membrane [8] and hence that the cubic membrane structures must be of the inverted type (type II) rather than of \"normal\" type (type I). All known lipid-water and lipidprotein-water systems that exhibit phases in equilibrium with excess water are of the inverted type (type II). Thus, water activity is an important factor to determine the structure of cubic membranes. Inverted cubic phases have been observed with very high water activity (70-90%), in the mixtures of lipids, in lipid-protein systems, in lipid-polymer systems [22] , and in lipid and lipopolysaccharide mixtures [23, 24] . The other major difference between cubic phase and cubic membrane is the lattice size. Most cubic phases in lipid-water systems exhibit unit cell parameters not larger than 20 nm, while in cellular cubic membranes the lattice size is usually larger than 50 nm. However, in lipid-protein-water, lipid-poloxamer-water, and lipid-cationic surfactant-water systems, cubic phases with lattice size of 50 nm have also been observed [3] . On the other hand, the lattice size of cubic membranes is rarely less than 50 nm (e.g., in prolamellar bodies) and usually ranges from 50 to 500 nm. Cubic membranes with large lattice size (500 nm) were observed in chloroplast membranes of green algae Zygnema [25] .",

Furthermore, the cubic phases have been at times mistaken for nonequilibrium isogel and claimed to belong to the group of \"microemulsions.\" This might be due to the fact that cubic phase when formed may be pseudostable for a long time at nonequilibrium temperatures. It may also take considerable time before the cubic structure is formed. In some cases, the cubic phases occur transiently in the biochemical process. Similarly, the infrequent observation of cubic membrane in the cells under normal conditions could be due to the transient transformation of biomembranes for short time into cubic morphology. However, the \"unbalanced\" or stress conditions of the cell may favor cubic membranes arrangements. This also may explain the discrepancy in reporting cubic membrane formation from different research groups examining the same cell type under similar experimental conditions.",

Such a strain hardening is probably due to the occurrence of dislocation and is evidence for a periodic 3D network.

However, our recent experimental data may shed light on some physical properties of cubic membranes such as their ability to interaction with macromolecules and the optical interference filtering of light of certain wave lengths (see section 6.2.)",

As a matter of fact, the major experimental limitations of identifying 2D periodic hexagonal or 3D periodic cubic membrane morphologies in (living) cells are caused by the dimensions of these structures and by limited analysis tools at this size range in vivo. In vitro, complex lyotropic liquid crystalline phases, such as, lamellar (La), H II , or Q II structures, are readily amenable to a range of experimental techniques, such as small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and differential scanning calorimetry. These techniques, however, are not feasible in whole cells because of limited resolution power and the strong background noise. Thus, the experimental approach to uncover nonlamellar membrane structures in (fixed) biological samples is restricted to TEM, leaving a wide range of interpretations for 3D structures between fact and artifact.",

Within one day of starvation, about 70% of mitochondria undergo this morphological transition, which after 7 days of starvation is observed in virtually all mitochondria [27] . Intriguingly, this process is fully reversible to wild-type morphology upon refeeding [5] . Using electron tomography, we have unequivocally demonstrated that inner mitochondrial membranes in C. carolinense cells adopt cubic morphology [7] .

Not surprisingly, the ER was found to be the most prominent target of morphological alterations because of its highly convoluted structure and central functions in membrane lipid synthesis, assembly, secretion of membrane and secretory proteins, ion homeostasis, and membrane quality control. Thus, these morphologies (because of their complex morphology in TEM micrographs) appear under numerous nicknames in the literature, such as \"undulating membranes\" [29] , \"cotte de mailles\" [30] , \"membrane lattice\" [31] , \"crystalloid membranes\" [32] , \"paracrystalline ER\" [33] , \"tubuloreticular structures\" [3, 4, 34] , and \"organized smooth ER\" (OSER) that is formed in response to elevated levels of the membrane-resident protein cytochrome b(5) [21] . Quite remarkably, the most prominent examples of ER expansion are related ER stress condition and may occur, for example, as a response to hypoxia stress [35] , drug treatment [36] , or tumors [29] , or specifically, upon stimulation of lymphocytes with lipopolysaccharide [37] or interferon [38] . Tubuloreticular structures are also formed in SARS coronavirus infected cells [39] and, indeed, have been subsequently identified to resemble cubic membrane architecture [6] .

Several membrane proteins have been shown to induce cubic membrane formation upon experimental dys-regulation, for example, HMG-CoA reductase [41] [42] [43] [44] , cytochrome b(5) [21] , msALDH [32] InsP3 receptor [35] , cytochrome P450 [45] , b subunit of F 1 F 0 ATP synthase [46] , fumarate reductase [47] , and unassembled rubella virus E1 glycoprotein subunits [48] . Detailed study on the overexpression of specific ER-resident proteins such as cytochrome b(5) in COS-7 cells revealed that the biogenesis of OSER structures may involve weak homotypic interactions between cytoplasmic domains of proteins and may underlie the formation of other stacked membrane structures within the cells as well [21] . Time-lapse imaging of OSER biogenesis revealed that these structures formed rather quickly once a threshold level of OSER-inducing proteins was exceeded; OSER formation also involved gross remodeling of surrounding tubular ER. In this system, the attachment to the cytoplasmic domain of different ER-resident membrane proteins of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that is capable of low affinity, head-to-tail dimerization was sufficient to induce OSER formation upon overexpression of cytochrome b(5) in living cells [21] . Recent evidences shows that the formation of cubic membranes, in the ER could also be triggered by controlled dimerization of \"artificial\" membrane proteins in mammalian tissue culture cells [49] . Homotypic low affinity interactions between cytoplasmic domains of proteins thus can transform tubular ER into stacked lamellae or crystalloid structures; such a mechanism may underlie the reorganization of other organelles into stacked membrane structures as well [21] and provides an intriguing model system to investigate the cellular and molecular requirements for cubic membrane formation.",

Although cubic phases can be formed by \"nonlamellar\" lipids in vitro, only very few data directly correlate cubic membrane formation with cellular lipid profiles in vivo [50] . In one study, it was shown that the molar ratio of monogalactosyl diacylglycerol to digalactosyl diacylglycerol was higher in the prolamellar body (PLB) fraction that exhibits cubic membrane morphology than in the prothylakoid fraction [50] . Also, the content of glycolipids and protochlorophyllides was increased in the PLB fraction [50] . Detailed lipid analysis of amoeba Chaos cells with cubic membrane organization in their mitochondria revealed an unusually high concentration of highly polyunsaturated fatty acids (C22:5; docosapentaenoic acid) [40] . Three predominant lipid species, namely plasmalogen PE (C16:0/C22:5), plasmalogen PC (C16:0/ C22:5), and diacyl-PI (C22:5/C22:5), were identified in amoeba Chaos lipid extracts and their relative amounts doubled under starvation stress conditions [40] . A rich body of data suggests that plasmalogens-which are also present in mammalian cell membranes-may serve as mediators of membrane dynamics because of their high propensity to form inverted hexagonal structures [51] . This property has also suggested a potential role for plasmalogens in facilitating membrane fusion processes (for review see Ref. [52] ). Biophysical studies have also shown that the presence of plasmalogen PE lowers the lamellar (La) to hexagonal-phase (H II ) transition temperature [53] . Interestingly, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which display massive membrane rearrangements upon HMG-CoA reductase overexpression, are also rich in plasmalogen lipids (up to 11% of their total phospholipids), especially plasmalogen PE [54] .",

Furthermore, pathological conditions result in disturbance of intracellular Ca 2\u00fe homeostasis that are frequently associated with cubic membrane formation (e.g., muscular dystrophy) [2] .

            "text": "Frequent observation of ER membranes transformation into cubic structure provides a valuable experimental system to analyze the underlying molecular mechanisms of cubic membrane formation. ER is the most prominent membranous network in the cell responsible for the synthesis and trafficking of a wide range of lipids and proteins. It is also a critical organelle for Ca 2\u00fe homeostasis. As a central regulator of protein synthesis, trafficking, and targeting, the ability of ER to adapt its capacity to manage synthetic, metabolic, and other adverse conditions is of paramount importance for the cell. Under conditions that challenge ER function and induce cubic membrane formation, particularly an overexpression of recombinant proteins as well as disturbance in calcium storage and redox status, the overloaded ER with unfolded or misfolded proteins would overwhelm ER function [55] . To maintain homeostasis, the ER has evolved functions to sense the stress in its lumen and transduce signals to the cytoplasm and the nucleus in an attempt to adapt for cell survival. These responses including transcriptional activation and translational attenuation are collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) [56] . The three major pathways in which ER responds to stress conditions (see Fig. 2 ) have also been implicated in the regulation of cellular lipogenesis and likely in cubic The Cubic \"Faces\" of Biomembranes membrane formation. In response to low sterol levels, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) proteins translocate from ER to the Golgi and are processed into active transcription factors [57] . Activation of SREBP proteins is critical for the regulation of target genes involved in cholesterol metabolism (SREBP2) or lipid (SREBP1) synthesis [58] . SREBP transcription factors induce cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acid syntheses for new membrane formation and ER expansion, probably, to accommodate the newly formed proteins. Interestingly, both overexpression of transmembrane protein and increased levels of unsaturated fatty acids (and probably the cholesterol) have been linked to cubic membrane formation [40] . It will be fascinating to propose this integrated network of responses to cellular stress and how it relates to the membrane transformation of the ER. ER stress could induce transformation of its morphology from lamellar into cubic organization in response to and through integrated alteration of membrane lipid and protein content in response to ER stress conditions. Cubic membranes thereafter may play a role in ameliorating ER stress through facilitating macromolecule transportation between the ER and the cytoplasm or transporting unfolded or misfolded proteins from ER lumen to the phagosomes (see section 6.1.).",

To what extent intracellular trafficking depends on or can be optimized through specific types of membrane organization, for example, as continuous 3D space partitioners or networks, is unknown. In our recent experimental study, we have shown that isolated mitochondria with cubic membrane organization from starved amoeba cells incorporate and retain short oligonucleotides (ODN) with high efficiency [59] . Although the molecular basis for the high affinity of ODN to cubic membranes has not been uncovered yet, it is reasonable to assume that it is strongly promoted by electrostatic interactions with the highly curved and extended membrane surface. The ability of cubic membranes to uptake and retain biomacromolecules within their channels might explain the vital role of cubic membrane organization in viral replication, assembly, and excretion from the infected cell [60] . The model for cubic membranes as a virus assembly site \"virus factory\" [2] is strongly supported by TEM images of virus particles captured in the process of budding off from cubic membranes [6] . The time-course of host cubic membrane formation that occurs immediately before RNA virus maturation further supports a functional role for cubic membranes as a specialized site for viral replication and assembly [61] . The interconnected convoluted channel structure of cubic membranes could provide an ideal architecture for local concentration and storage of viral precursor molecules, with adequate interaction with the host cytoplasm. The 3D continuous membrane network with surface pores that are The Cubic \"Faces\" of Biomembranes 50-80 nm in diameter might offer a preferable environment as a transport system or a passageway for selective entry of viral proteins, nucleic acids, and other precursors for de novo assembly of virion particles.",

Cubic membranes may facilitate enrichment-or exclusion-of certain lipids and proteins, as a prerequisite for vesicle-mediated subcellular trafficking. They may also function as partitioners within the membrane-bound organelles, to create subdomains of specific molecular composition and function. It has been repeatedly noted that the stage of cell division and differentiation has a strong influence on the formation of cubic membranes [2] . Cells that undergo rapid cell division and differentiation, such as the differentiating sieve elements, cells during spermatogenesis, or tumor cells, are well overrepresented in the collection of cubic-membrane-forming cells [2] . Obviously, during cell division and differentiation events, there is a greater need for regulated spatiotemporal transport, as well as cellular communication, which is particularly well illustrated during spermatogenesis. In the case of differentiating sieve elements, cubic membranes might have a particular role in the assimilated transport process.",

Photonic crystals based on triply periodic level surfaces with the largest photonic band gap (PBG) are of type D and G cubic structures [62] . It has been shown that D and G architectures present very wide and complete PBG [62] . The same G-surfaces are used to describe cubic membrane organization of \"lens mitochondria\" observed in Tupaia species [2, 65, 66] . As both lens mitochondria and photonic crystals with PBG properties share the same geometry (G type), it is interesting to speculate that cubic membrane architecture in the lens mitochondria of Tupaia species may function as a photonic crystal with a lattice size close to UV wavelength and their PBG property might be able to block or direct UV light from reaching the outer segment of photoreceptors.",

The Cubic \"Faces\" of Biomembranes So a dual hypothesis can be tested with this work. And even if the photonic properties of the membrane assembly prove to be insufficient, there is strong evidence that their optical properties are significantly more far reaching than have been demonstrated before, with most of the presumptions being testable theoretically and computationally. The numerical framework, however, is too computationally demanding to be exhaustively implemented. We tested and deemed sufficient the use of lower orders of diffraction only in a Monte-Carlo scattering simulation which simulates the full phase and polarization evolution of the light transition. These simplifications are also applicable to large assemblies and frameworks and allow for quantitative predictions of much more complex cubic membrane assemblies.

Recent investigations show that long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) such as DPA may have antioxidant abilities [40] . In one study [76] , it was noted that fatty acid micelles containing LC-PUFAs were able to scavenge greater amounts of superoxide anions than that containing saturated fatty acids. In another investigation, it was observed that Escherichia coli cells with elevated levels of LC-PUFAs were resistant to hydrogen peroxide damage [77] . These cells exhibit lower intracellular concentrations of hydrogen peroxide than the control strain when treated with exogenous hydrogen peroxide [77] .
