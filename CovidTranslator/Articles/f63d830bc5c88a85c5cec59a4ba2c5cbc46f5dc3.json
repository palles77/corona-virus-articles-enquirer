It causes an acute and highly contagious disease in chickens, which is responsible for high economic losses in the poultry industry. The current control strategies are based mainly on mass vaccination strategies. Nevertheless, vaccine-induced immunity generally give poor protection because the current vaccine offers only limited cross protection among strains (Cook et al., 2012; de Wit et al., 2011) mainly due to the antigenic diversity caused by the variability of the S1 protein.",

Another important mechanism that underlies the emergence of novel IBV strains is genomic recombination. In Australia, three recently isolated novel subgroup IBV strains were shown to be derived from recombination between subgroup 1 and 2 strains (Mardani et al., 2010) . More recently, the complete genome analysis of newly emerged strains found multiple recombination events throughout the genome between wild-type viruses and vaccine strains (Quinteros et al., 2016) . In the USA, the emergent virulent strain Ark DPI appears to have originated from recombination among four different IBV strains (Ammayappan et al., 2008) . In addition, the emergence of new strains in the USA has been reported to have arisen from recombination events between the Massachusetts (Mass), Connecticut (Conn), and Holte strains as well as field strains (Thor et al., 2011) . Recently in Europe, it has been shown that emergent viruses, such as the XDN-like virus in Spain and Italy (Moreno et al., 2016) , and the \u03b3CoV/Ck/Italy/I2022/13 virus in Italy (Franzo et al., 2015) , may have arisen from recombination events.",

Since 1995, the predominant IBV type in China has been LX4 (also known as QX-like viruses), but molecular studies have shown that new types and variants are emerging continually Mo et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015; Leghari et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017) . It has been suggested that the emergent IBV strains in China may have different origins. It is considered that some of the IBV types circulating in China, such as Mass and 793/B, are the most widely distributed types worldwide and they may have infected Chinese chickens from an exogenous source, probably due to the use of live vaccines (Chen et al., 2015; Han et al., 2017) . By contrast, some IBV types, such as LX4 and ck/CH/LDL/97I (Q1-like), are believed to have originated in China and spread to other regions of the world (Valastro et al., 2016) . The remaining IBV types, such as ck/CH/LSC/99I (Liu et al., 2006a,b) , nrTW I , and GI-28 , are considered to be indigenous to China. The origins of most of the IBV types in China are still unknown, although it has been shown that some of these types have arisen from recombination events (Chen et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017) . The results of many of these previous studies are based on analyses of the available S1 gene sequences, but it is impossible to fully understand the origins and evolutionary processes related to these emerging viruses by only analyzing this small part of the genome.",

The birds were also vaccinated with a bivalent, inactivated vaccine, Newcastle disease virus La Sota/ IBV M41, at 120 days. Some of the birds exhibited respiratory signs of IB at 150 days, which was accompanied by decreased egg production and abnormal shell quality in the breeding hens, and the clinical signs disappeared approximately 20 days later. The morbidity was approximately 5% and only a few birds died during this outbreak. Gross lesions were mainly associated with tracheitis and proventriculitis, and hepatitis and hydropericardium were observed in some chickens.

            "text": "IB is among the most important diseases in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated chickens in China, and it has been monitored continuously in chicken flocks since it was first identified. An outbreak possibly caused by a respiratory pathogen occurred at the end of 2016 in a broiler breeder flock in Neimenggu Province in China, and only a very small number of diseased chickens died during the outbreak. However, the egg production decreased and the egg quality was adversely affected. The main lesions were tracheitis and proventriculitis at the early stage of the outbreak, and severe bacterial infections were observed at the late stage, but no obvious kidney lesions were observed in the dead chickens throughout the outbreak. An IBV strain designated as I1101/16 was isolated from the tracheas of the dead chickens. Both the IB live vaccines H120 and 4/91 as well as an inactivated vaccine were used to vaccinate the chicken flock before the occurrence of the IB outbreak, so we initially sequenced the S1 gene to identify, differentiate, and genotype the IBV isolate. Based on the S1 gene analysis, the I1101/16 isolate clustered most closely with reference strains of the nTW I type , and it has been diverging as an independent genetic clade with the ck/CH/LJL/140901 strain (Fig. 1) . Our analysis showed that the I1101/16 isolate and the ck/CH/LJL/ 140901 strain were more closely related serologically compared with other IBV serotypes (Table 1) , but the serotype relatedness value was only 65 between these strains, which is greater than 50% but well below 80%, i.e., the lower cutoff value for the same serotype and the Fig. 2 . Multiple alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the five conformation-dependent neutralizing antigenic sites (epitopes) mapped to the S1 subunit of the spike protein and another immunodominant region in the amino-terminal region of the S2 protein using the I1101/16 isolate and the seven reference strains. The sequences of the I1101/16 isolate are listed; only the amino acids that differed from those of the I1101/16 isolate are depicted and the amino acids that were same as those of the I1101/16 isolate are represented by dots. Deleted amino acid residues are represented by dashes. 3 . Alignment of the complete genome sequences of the I1101/16 isolate and the seven reference strains performed using MAFFT. The genome sequence of the IBV I1101/16 isolate was set as the reference sequence. The reference sequence was represented by black and gray gaps in the reference sequence indicated the nucleotide insertion occurred in the genomes sequence of other viruses. The nucleotide sequences of other viruses which disagreement to the reference sequence at indicated positions were represented by black, while the nucleotide sequences of other viruses which agreement to the reference sequence at indicated positions were represented by gray. The GenBank accession numbers for these genome sequences are the same as those in Fig. 1. maximum value defining serotype relatedness, respectively (Wadey and Faragher, 1981) . The low antigenic relatedness between the I1101/16 isolate and the ck/CH/LJL/140901 strain was not due to differences in their B cell epitopes because the sequences of the B cell antigenic epitopes located in the spike protein were nearly identical in both viruses, although it has been reported that only a few amino acid changes in the S1 subunit of the spike protein can result in serologically distinct viruses (Cavanagh et al., 1992a,b) . Hence, we focused on the entire spike gene of the two viruses, especially the S2 subunit of the spike gene. Interestingly, there was greater genetic diversity in the spike gene (90.9%) between the I1101/16 isolate and the ck/CH/LJL/140901 strain compared with that of S1 gene (95.7%), thereby indicating the greater divergence of the S2 region, which led us to conclude that possible recombination events may have occurred in the genome of the I1101/16 isolate. Next, recombination events were analyzed using the complete genomic sequences of these strains. According to MAFFT, only the S2 gene of the I1101/16 isolate was highly similar to that of the 4/91 strain, whereas the remainder of the genome was highly similar to that of the ck/CH/LHLJ/140901 strain. This suggests that for the emergent I1101/16 isolate, the donor of the S2 gene was probably a 4/91-like virus, whereas the remainder of the genome came from a ck/CH/LHLJ/ 140901-like virus. The first prerequisite for recombination is considered to be co-infection. IBV strain ck/CH/LHLJ/14090 is one of the deduced parental viruses of the I1101/16 isolate and it has an nrTW serotype, where it originated from recombination events between TW I-like and LX4-like viruses in China around 2009 . In the commercial poultry industry in China, IBV is controlled by the use of live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Vaccine 4/91 is another deduced parental virus of the I1101/16 isolate and it has been used widely in China for a long time. Previously, we found that vaccination with the 4/91 strain cannot provide complete protection against nrTW viruses , but vaccination with the 4/91 strain allows prolonged replication and shedding of the vaccine virus . Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that vaccination with the 4/91 vaccine produces an environment where co-infections between field and vaccine strains can occur, which may enhance the likelihood of recombination.",

The exchange of part of a region of the genome allows viruses to rapidly explore areas of sequence space, potentially leading to the emergence of variants with different features in terms of their virulence, cross-protection, and cell and host tropisms (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011) . It is considered that the emergence of the Australian N1/88 strain was driven by antigenic differences between the virus and other circulating IBVs, but also by the enhanced capacity of the recombinant virus to replicate in chickens (Quinteros et al., 2016) . We found that the recombinant I1101/16 isolate was serologically related to but not the same as strain ck/CH/LHLJ/140901. We cannot conclude that this antigenic change was due to recombination because the B cell antigenic epitopes located in the spike protein (including that located in the S2 subunit of the spike gene) were nearly identical in the two viruses. In addition, it is very interesting to note that the/I1101/16 isolate exhibited decreased replication levels in both the tracheal and kidney tissues (two target tissues for most IBVs) compared with one of its parental viruses (the ck/CH/LHLJ/140901 strain, which does not cause severe clinical disease in SPF chickens), but it exhibited prolonged replication and shedding post-challenge in a Table 3 Pairwise comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of the S2 subunit of the spike genes between the 4/91 vaccine strain, I1101/16 isolate, and pathogenic 4/91 strain a . a Nucleotides shared between the I1101/16 isolate and 4/91 vaccine strain are shown in gray. b Nucleotide positions corresponding to those in the spike gene in the 4/91 vaccine strain.",

Replication of the I1101/16 isolate and ck/CH/LJL/140901 strain in the trachea and kidneys of chickens. One-day-old SPF layer chickens were inoculated with a dosage of 1 \u00d7 10 5.5 EID 50 of the I1101/16 isolate or the ck/CH/LJL/140901 strain in a 0.1-ml volume, and the trachea and kidneys from each bird were collected at 5 days post-challenge for virus titration in eggs. Each bar represents the virus titer from an individual bird. membrane fusion unit of the ectodomain contains two heptad repeat regions, which interact to form the coiled-coil structure of the stalk (de Groot et al., 1987; Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) , and a putative fusion peptide. After endocytosis, conformational changes in the S protein are triggered by exposure to acidic pH in the endosomes (Chu et al., 2006) , thereby resulting in fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane. The S2 domain is not involved mainly with binding to the host cell receptor, but the interplay between S1 and S2 might synergistically determine the avidity and specificity of viral attachment (de Hann et al., 2006; Promkuntod et al., 2013) . It is unknown whether the changes in the spike protein caused by the recombination event altered the antigenic and pathogenic features of the I1106/16 isolate, or whether it is more likely that these changes as well as other changes in polymerase peptides are jointly rather than individually responsible for the differences in the features of the two IBV strains. However, it has been reported that recombination is likely to have a high fitness cost because of the destruction of optimized intra-and inter-protein interactions (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011), where the fitness of recombinant IBV strains must be superior to that of the parental strains if they are to emerge and spread in the environment. Thus, the fitness of recombinant IBVs requires further investigation. This study does not provide evidence that recombination can directly alter the antigenicity, virulence, replication, shedding, and tissue tropism of a virus, but because the backbone of the investigated virus differs substantially, we showed that gene(s) exchange between IBVs is likely to be the major determinant of viral evolution. Our previous results Liu et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015) and the results obtained in this study provide evidence that recombination events are occurring frequently in the field in China. High chicken densities in poultry farms and the co-circulation of multiple IBV strains in a given flock as well as the use of different live vaccine strains may explain the high frequency of recombination. Researchers should be aware of the effect of virus recombination, especially recombination events between field and vaccine strains, which may cause changes in viral features. In addition, the currently applied vaccination strategy for protection against the nTW I IBV type should be improved and implemented properly.",
