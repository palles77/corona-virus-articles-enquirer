The serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal and median raphe project widely in the brain. They innervate the olfactory bulbs and can be targets for exogenous agents attacking the olfactory epithelium and bulbs. We report here an injury to the serotoninergic neurons after intranasal infection in 12\"day-old rats with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus. The brain infection was focal and transient. Viral antigens could no longer be detected 13-15 days after infection. In spite of this the animals, as adults, had a severe serotonin depletion in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and showed abnormal locomotor and explorative behaviour as well as learning deficits. The neocortex was histologically intact and parameters related to other neurotransmitte~ such as dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA and acetylcholine showed no marked changes.",

These include serotoninergic neurons in the raphe nuclei, noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, and cholinergic neurons in the basal nucleus of Meynert, the diagonal bands and the septal nuclei. In some of these nuclei, i.e. the raphe nuclei, the diagonal band and the locus coeruleus, nerve cells project directly to the olfactory bulbs, and can accumulate exogenous substances from these regions by retrograde axonal transport. These nuclei may therefore be especially susceptible to pathogenetic agents that reach the neuroepithelium in the nasal cavity.\".35 Several neurovirulent viruses may attack the olfactory epithelium and spread anterogradely along olfactory pathways to the brain.14 We have previously shown that by retrograde transport a virus infection in the olfactory bulbs may cause an early attack on the diagonal bands, the raphe and the locus coeruleus.20~2' By choosing a slowly replicating **To whom correspondence should be addressed.",

The water maze task has been widely used in investigating the neural basis of spatial Learning, and it has been established that lesion of the hippocampus impairs acquisition of the maze task.27' The apparatus consisted of a circular pool measuring 140 cm in diameter and 45 cm in height; and painted grey.

The serotoninergic midline raphe neurons seem to be more vulnerable to the \"hit and run\" effect of the VSV than the cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons, although all three systems can be infected.*' The reason for this is not clear, but may be related to a much higher density of 5-HT terminals in the olfactory bulbs than those of the other neuronal systems analysed,6 rendering them more Iikeiy to be attacked by an exogenous agent in this region.",

Virtually all of these studies deal with the effects of intracerebral (i.c.) virus inoculations.'3,'7,22 For example, i.c. administration of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus causes a persistent infection in mice and results in longlasting changes of behaviour characterized by hypoactivity in open field and running wheel activity tests.17 More selective infections have been observed with a certain strain of mouse hepatitis virus with attack on the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus causing locomotor disturbances.* In humans, encephalitis lethargica (supposed to be of viral origin) was associated with alterations not only in the substantia nigra but also in raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus and nucleus basalis of Meynert3' In some of the survivors this resulted in Parkinsonism, but hy~ractivity and asocial behaviour were also described, especially in children.38 CONCLUSION Our observations show that a virus infection spreading from the nasal cavity at a certain period during infancy can lead to serotonin depletion in the brain and long-lasting alterations of behaviour. The VSV-infected rat may serve as a useful model to evaluate pharmacological treatment strategies for those types of behavioural disturbances, which may have a human counterpart in some cases of attention deficit disorders. 41 Late morphological and biochemical changes due to different types of infections in the olfactory system are also of interest to evaluate, since there are indications that this system is involved early in Alzheimer's disease.36 Further studies of the effects of self-limiting experimental virus infections established by a natural route of spreading to the brain are warranted. A documentation of corresponding disturbances of cognitive and locomotor functions in other virus-host systems would justify introduction of the term \"behavioural virology\".",
