            "text": "Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a newly identified enteric alphacoronavirus that causes fatal diarrhea in newborn piglets in China. Here, we propagated a virulent strain SADS-CoV/CN/GDWT/ 2017 in Vero cells for up to 83 passages. Four strains of SADS-CoV/GDWT-P7, -P18, -P48 and -P83 were isolated and characterized. Sequence alignments showed that these four novel strains exhibited 16 nucleotide mutations and resultant 10 amino acid substitutions in open reading frame 1a/1b, spike, NS3a, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. Furthermore, a 58-bp deletion in NS7a/7b was found in P48 and P83 strains, which led to the loss of NS7b and 38 amino acid changes of NS7a. Pig infection studies showed that the P7 strain caused typical watery diarrhea, while the P83 strain induced none-to-mild, delayed and transient diarrhea. This is the first report on cell adaption of a virulent SADS-CoV strain, which gives information on the potential virulence determinants of SADS-CoV.",

            "text": "In 2017, SADS-CoV infection broke out in Guangdong Province of China and resulted in the death of around 25, 000 piglets within a few months (Zhou et al., 2018a) . At that time, some farms used the virus solution collected from intestines of infected piglets to feed pregnant sows orally, to a certain degree which prevented the spread of SADS-CoV. However, SADS-CoV re-emerged in Guangdong on February 2019 and led to the death of around 2000 piglets in one farm (Zhou et al., 2019a) . So, there is an urgent need to isolate attenuated strains and develop vaccines to control SADS-CoV in pigs in China. Actually, the best way to prevent virus infection is vaccination of pregnant sows, which can induce lactogenic immunity, and their transmission to suckling piglets via colostrum and milk, are critical for early passive protection (Chattha et al., 2015) . Like SADS-CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is also an enteric alphacoronavirus in pigs, but it can cause diarrhea to pigs of all ages and widespread in the world. To control PEDV, many live attenuated vaccines have been manufactured and licensed, for example, 83P-5 (Sato et al., 2011) , attenuated CV77 (Sun et al., 2016) , DR13 (Park et al., 2012) , and SM98 (Kim et al., 2015) . And more PEDV vaccine candidates including PEDVPT-P96 (Chang et al., 2017) , PC22A-derived strains (Lin et al., 2017) , PEDV YN-144 (Chen et al., 2015) , Zhejinag08 , iPEDVPT-P96 (Kao et al., 2018) , and VSVMT-S\u039419 (Ke et al., 2019) also have been developed by serial cell passaging, cDNA clone construction or recombinant attenuated virus vector. As a newly discovered alphacoronavirus, recent studies regarding SADS-CoV have been mainly focused on molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, and experimental infection models (Fu et al., 2018; Zhoub et al. 2018 Zhoub et al. , 2019 Xu et al., 2019) information on SADS-CoV attenuation and vaccine development is yet to be obtained. The emergence and re-emergence of SADS-CoV have posted a great threat to the pig industry in China, which make it necessary to generate vaccines to prevent and control SASD-CoV infection.",

The ORF1a/1b had most mutations containing 9 nt and 5 aa changes, followed by S and N gene each harboring 2 nt and 1 aa changes. The E, M and NS3a had one aa substitution, respectively. Besides these mutations, a large deletion of 58 bp was found in SADS-CoV/GDWT-P48 and -P83. This 58 bp-deletion led to the loss of initial codons for both NS7a and NS7b and a reading frame shift for NS7a. As a result, the NS7b gene was lost in genomes of these two high-passage strains. For the Ns7a gene, the reading frame moved forward and caused an overlap of 107bp between the N and the NS7a. Finally, 20 additional aa were encoded and 18 aa substitutions were substituted in the initial part of NS7a (Fig. 4) .",

Four novel strains SADS-CoV/GDWT-P7, -P18, -P48 and -P83 were successfully isolated and their genetic and pathogenic characteristics were ascertained. Compared to SADS-CoV/GDWT-P7-inoucalted piglets, SADS-CoV/ GDWT-P83-inoculated piglets showed a mild and transient diarrhea with shorter viral shedding, weakened tissue tropism and undetected histopathological lesion, which provides evidence of viral attenuation and highlights SADS-CoV/GDWT-P83 strain as a potential, live-attenuated SADS-CoV vaccine candidate.",

By comparing with the sequence of SADS-CoV/CN/GDWT/2017, nucleotide mutations in ORF1a/b, N, S, E, M and NS3a were identified. Our result showed that half of the non-silent mutations (5/10) were located in the ORF1a gene, i.e. NSP2, NSP3, NSP4 and NSP6. It is well known that the NSPs of coronaviruses are associated with viral replications, many of which are considered to be interferon antagonists (Xing et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2017) . Previous findings of PEDV attenuation also revealed relatively large nucleotide changes in ORF1a/1b (Chen et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017) , which suggests this may be a common feature for both SADS-CoV and PEDV. As a major surface protein, the coronavirus S protein possesses two subunits S1 and S2, which are responsible for cell receptor interaction and cell membrane fusion, respectively (Hulswit et al., 2016) . In the present study, only one nucleotide mutation and resultant one amino acid substitution was found in the S2 region, and no insertion or deletion was observed in S gene, which were different with the discovery of PEDV. Some cell culture-attenuated PEDV strains, e.g., PEDV YN-144 (Chen et al., 2015) , PEDVPT-P96 (Chang et al., 2017) and PC22A-derived strains (Lin et al., 2017) , had many or most of amino acid changes in the region of S gene. Insertion mutations that resulted in four amino acid changes were found in the S1 region of cell culture-passaged PEDV CH/HNPJ/2016 strains (Liu et al., 2019) . However, there was also no nucleotide change observed in S gene of attenuated PED-CUP-B2014 strain (Park et al., 2018) . These results indicated multiple mutation patterns of virus attenuation during cell passaging. For SADS-CoV, more analyses are needed to explore potential molecular mechanisms of attenuation to provide valuable data for vaccine developments.",

Many groups have demonstrated that cell-adapted PEDV or TGEV strains display either internal truncation or amino acid changes in the ORF3 gene, which suggests that ORF3 is of key importance for virus adaption and virulence attenuation (Zhang et al., 2007; Park et al., 2012; Jengarn et al., 2015; Wongthida et al., 2017) . Similar to these findings, we observed the amino variation in the NS3a region of SADS-CoV/GDWT-P7 and other three new isolated strains, and we also noticed that the pathogenicity of P7-infected piglets was lower than that of the wild type SADS-COV strain. Although presenting typical SADS-CoV-associated diarrhea, P7-innoculated piglets survived and recovered in a week. The amino variation of NS3a in our assay seems to contribute to the virulence attenuation, which need further analysis to confirm the link between NS3a and attenuation of SADS-CoV.",

Virology 538 (2019) 61-70 et al., 2004) ; but there was also a report that the virulence of ORF7deleted TGEV was enhanced compared with that of parental viruses (Cruz et al., 2011) . For SADS-CoV, as the total deletion of 7b protein and large substitutions of 7a protein appeared in the middle and late stage of cell passage, as well as the P83 strain presenting low virulence to piglets, we speculated that these changes in NS7a/7b may also contribute to the attenuation of SADS-CoV. In addition to virulence modulation, protein 7 also plays a role in interactions between virus infection and innate immunity. The absence of TGEV protein 7 increased expressions of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-stimulated genes and proinflammatory genes (Cruz et al., 2013) . FIPV 7a protein acted as a type I IFN antagonist, when cooperating with ORF3-encoded proteins (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2014) . Functions of protein 7 of SADS-CoV is necessary to study further to clarify its roles in cell adaption and virulence alteration. Collectively, our results showed that all nine ORFs of SADS-CoV exhibited nucleotide and amino acid changes during serial propagation, which indicates the attenuation of virus may be multifactorial. These variations mentioned above along the genome may constitute a combination to have an impact on cell adaptation and virulence attenuation of SADS-CoV, or it is possible that some individual mutations may have key determinants, all of which need more investigations by the reverse genetic method.",
