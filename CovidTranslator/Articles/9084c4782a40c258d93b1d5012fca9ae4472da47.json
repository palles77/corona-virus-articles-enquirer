            "text": "A newly developed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was further validated to confirm cutoff values and evaluate its diagnostic performance with clinical samples. In parallel, an immunochromatographic test was also evaluated. A total of 227 clinical serum specimens collected from SARS patients were used in the study, together with 385 samples from healthy donors. By use of an immunofluorescent (IF) test as the \"gold standard, \" both the ELISA and the immunochromatographic test were able to detect immunoglobulin G antibodies to SARS not only from late-convalescent-stage samples (>21 days from the onset of clinical symptoms), as previously established, but also from early-acute-phase samples (1 to 10 days from onset). The ELISA, using an optical density (OD) of 0.25 as its cutoff value, produced the best sensitivity while maintaining high specificity. It detected SARS-specific antibodies in 58, 70, 75, and 95%, respectively, of the four groups of samples collected from patients 1 to 10 days, 11 to 20 days, 21 to 30 days, and more than 30 days after the onset of clinical symptoms. Similarly, the immunochromatographic test detected SARS-specific antibodies in 55, 68, 81, and 79% of the four groups, respectively. The overall specificities for the ELISA and the rapid test were 99.5 and 97.7%, respectively. Although the positive correlation observed between the ELISA OD values and the IF titers was moderate (r \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.6915; P < 0.001), the detection rates of both the ELISA and the rapid test were found well in agreement with the IF titers.",

            "text": "The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious respiratory illness of global significance. Its highly contagious nature, combined with its high mortality rate, has proven disruptive and costly in an increasingly globalized world. As new cases appear to be reemerging in January 2004, the urgency for prompt identification and isolation of infected patients remains. Although the identification of the novel coronavirus SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiological agent for SARS (3, 4, 7, 9) made it possible for various tests to be developed, providing tools for laboratory diagnosis remains a priority, as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO). To date, there is still no standardized test for diagnosing SARS regardless of whether tests are antigen based or antibody based (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/conference/june _2003/materials/presentations/en/laboratorydiagnosis.pdf). In this regard, various immunofluorescent (IF) tests were essentially used as the \"gold standards\" for serodiagnosis of SARS during the 2003 outbreak. Although these IF protocols were found to be well correlated with PCR and clinical outcomes (9) , they differed from laboratory to laboratory and were technically very demanding. In addition, these protocols utilized virus-infected materials and thus required laboratories with biosafety-level-3 facilities un-der current regulations. Hence, alternative tests with standardized approaches addressing these shortcomings are very much needed. However, only a thorough evaluation with standardized panels or by a trial using large numbers of clinical specimens will help to firmly establish the usefulness of new tests.",

With the cutoff value set at an OD of 0.45, the ELISA produced the best specificity, 100% (385 of 385), but a low overall sensitivity of 60% (136 of 227) (Table 1) . However, improved performance was obtained when the cutoff value was adjusted lower, to an OD of 0.3 or 0.25. The ELISA de- tected almost 12% more SARS-associated samples overall with an OD of 0.25 as the cutoff value than with the OD 0.45 setting (Table 1 ). An improved delta value of 0.53 for positive results was also obtained. In a supplementary test, a further 1,066 samples from healthy controls were tested, and a mean OD of 0.0432 \u03ee 0.0745 was obtained. An OD of 0.25 was found to be equivalent to the mean OD \u03ee 3 SD, whereas an OD of 0.45 was found to be equivalent to the mean OD \u03ee 5 SD. The two cutoff values of 0.25 and 0.45 produced similarly high specificities of 98 versus 99.2%, 100 versus 100%, and 92 versus 98% for the supplemental healthy-control group, the non-SARS controls with respiratory illness, and the non-SARS controls with fever, respectively (Table 1) . With the cutoff set at an OD of 0.25, the ELISA detected IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV not only in late-convalescentstage samples (with a high sensitivity of 95%) but also in acute-phase specimens. It detected IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in 58, 70, and 75% of samples collected from SARS patients 1 to 10 days, 11 to 20 days, and 21 to 30 days after the onset of clinical symptoms, respectively. The specificity obtained with the cutoff OD of 0.25 remained high at 99.5% (383 of 385) for the healthy-control group tested at the same testing site ( Table 1 ). The test thus provided an overall positive predictive value (PPV) of 98.8% and an overall negative predictive value (NPV) of 85.7%. A moderate but positive correlation was also observed between the ELISA OD values and the IF titers (r \u03ed 0.6915; P \u03fd 0.001 [ Fig. 1]) . However, the correlation held firm, with the ELISA detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV in progressively more patient samples as IF titers increased (Fig. 2) .",

When the same set of clinical specimens was tested by the rapid immunochromatographic test, a performance similar to that of the ELISA was obtained. The overall rate of detection of SARS-associated specimens by the rapid test was 70.5% (160 of 227), and its specificity was 97.7% (376 of 385) ( Table  2) . Detection rates were 55, 68, 81, and 79%, respectively, for the four groups of samples collected from SARS patients at 1 to 10 days, 11 to 20 days, 21 to 30 days, and more than 30 days after the onset of clinical symptoms ( Table 2 ). Because this test utilized two recombinant proteins separately, represented by two resultant bands, the performances of the two proteins were also analyzed. The Gst-N protein alone detected antibodies to SARS-CoV in 157 of the 160 samples found to be positive by the two proteins combined (Table 2) . Furthermore, the Gst-N protein presented less cross-reactivity, reacting to only 1 of the 385 specimens from the healthy-control group. In contrast, Gst-U274 detected only 8% (18 of 227) overall of the SARSassociated samples but contributed to most of the nonspecific reactivity with samples from healthy controls (8 of 385). Interestingly, the three samples that were detected by Gst-U274 only, but not by the Gst-N protein, were those collected from patients at an earlier stage, 1 to 20 days after the onset of clinical symptoms ( Table 2 ). The test was therefore shown to have a PPV and an NPV of 94.7 and 84.9%, respectively, with the populations tested (Table 2) . Again, in a supplementary test, the rapid test was further evaluated with disease control groups consisting of non-SARS patients who suffered from respiratory illness or fever and was found to cross-react to only 3 of the 50 or 4 of the 50 samples tested in the respective groups (Table 2) . When the results were compared, the rapid test and the ELISA gave an excellent overall agreement of 92.5%, with a kappa statistic of 0.81 (Table 3 ). In addition, the rapid test was also found to perform well in concordance with the IF titers, detecting progressively more patient samples as the titers increased (Fig. 2) ",

For example, the apparently contradictory phenomenon of a high infection rate for health care workers but a low infection rate for family members has yet to be fully explained. It appears that viral loads are low both during early infection and after about 3 weeks of infection. This situation renders PCR techniques relatively insensitive during the early stage of infection. Serological approaches such as IF tests, as demonstrated, have been welcome complementary tools for combating SARS. In fact, IF tests were practically used as the gold standard for serodiagnosis of SARS in hospitals during the outbreak despite their limitations. Nevertheless, new approaches are needed, and the IF test should be a useful reference for our evaluations.",

In view of this recommendation, it may be appropriate to set a higher cutoff value of 0.45, with a PPV of 100%, for the ELISA when it is in use in low-risk areas in order to minimize the possibility of a false-positive result. Similarly, a lower cutoff value of 0.25, with an increased sensitivity and a higher NPV, may be desirable and appropriate when the ELISA is used in higher-risk areas. In this case, Western blot testing to further verify and confirm the results of samples repeatedly testing positive by the ELISA, especially in the case of borderline positives, will be helpful in resolving false-positives.

The present study appears to suggest a limitation of this protein. However, it is interesting that the only three samples that were detected by Gst-U274 but not Gst-N were those collected from patients in the earlier group, 1 to 20 days from the onset of clinical symptoms.",

            "text": "The positive correlation observed between the ELISA ODs and the IF titers was moderate, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.6915 (P \u03fd 0.001 [ Fig. 1] ). This finding suggested that the ELISA OD and the IF titers were only moderately associated; the difference between the two approaches could be due to the fact that the new test utilized recombinant proteins rather than the virus-infected cells used in the IF test. However, it is noteworthy that the overall performances of both the ELISA and the rapid test were well in concordance with the IF titers. Both new tests detected progressively more patient samples as IF titers increased (Fig. 2) . This finding, thus, suggested that the shortcomings of the new tests were mostly limited to samples with IF titers lower than 1:40 (Fig. 2) . Nevertheless, the two new tests had similar overall sensitivities of 70.5 to 71.8% and specificities of 97.7 to 99.5% relative to the IF test, which was used as the gold standard (Tables 1 and 2) . When the two tests were compared with each other, they gave an overall agreement of 92.4% with a kappa statistic of 0.81 ( Table 3 ). This confirmed our previous findings and suggested that although the immunochromatographic test is a simple and rapid test that needs no special training to use, its performance was fully compatible with that of the ELISA. The immunochromatographic test should be a valuable addition to current options for combating SARS, especially in areas where laboratory facilities are not available.",
