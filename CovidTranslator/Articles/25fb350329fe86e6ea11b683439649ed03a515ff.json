The prototypical coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), uses CEACAM1a, a member of the murine carcinoembryonic antigen family, to enter cells. Deletion of this protein makes mice resistant to infection 6 . Several group 1 coronaviruses use aminopeptidase N to adhere to host cells, consistent with their respiratory and enteric tract tropisms (reviewed in ref. 7) . SARS-CoV, a group 2 coronavirus, enters host cells through an interaction of the S protein with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 8 . Strikingly, human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63), which causes mild disease, also uses ACE2, although it binds to a different part of the protein than does SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 9, 10 . ACE2 is postulated to have a protective role in the inflamed lung, and SARS-CoV S protein binding to ACE2 is thought to contribute to disease severity 11, 12 . As infection with HCoV-NL63 produces mild disease, however, binding to ACE2 by itself cannot be sufficient for this process.",

Notably, nsp3 and nsp6 encode an odd number of hydrophobic domains, but both the amino and carboxyl termini of these proteins are in the cytoplasm, suggesting that one hydrophobic region does not span the membrane 60 ; whether this region contributes to membrane curvature or has another function requires further investigation.",

SARS-CoV, unlike HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, causes a severe Notable features of the disease were an apparent worsening of symptoms as the virus was cleared (suggesting the disease had an immunopathological basis), and a lack of contagion until lower respiratory tract symptoms were apparent. This latter feature made control of the epidemic by quarantine feasible, as it simplified identification of infected patients. unlike HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV also caused systemic disease, with evidence of infection of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney and brain, among other tissues 63 . Although the virus spread primarily via respiratory droplets, infection of the gastrointestinal tract may have facilitated other routes of spread. The recognition that SARS was caused by a coronavirus intensified the search for other pathogenic coronaviruses associated with human disease, which led to the identification of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKu1. These viruses were isolated from hospitalized patients, either young children with severe respiratory disease (HCoV-NL63) 64, 65 or elderly patients with underlying medical problems (HCoV-HKu1) 65,66 . HCoV-NL63 has infected human populations for centuries, as phylogenetic studies show that it diverged from HCoV-229E nearly 1,000 years ago 67 . HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKu1 have worldwide distributions and generally cause mild upper respiratory tract diseases, with the exception that HCoV-NL63 is also an aetiological agent of croup 68 . HCoV-NL63 can be propagated in tissue culture cells, and an infectious cDNA clone of this virus was recently engineered, facilitating future studies 69 . By contrast, HCoV-HKu1 cannot be grown in tissue culture cells, which makes it imperative that an infectious cDNA clone be developed for future studies.",

Adoptive transfer of CD4 + or CD8 + T splenocytes 7 or 30 days after immunization with jHMV to infected RAG1 -/or SCID mice results in virus clearance and demyelination [95] [96] [97] . Myelin destruction is also observed if anti-jHMV antibody is transferred to infected RAG1 -/mice in the absence of T cells 98 , or if mice are infected with virus expressing the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2 in the absence of other interventions 99 . In all cases, infiltrating macrophages appear to be crucial for virus clearance and subsequent demyelination; these results suggest that the process of macrophage infiltration can be initiated by T cells, anti-jHMV antibody or overexpression of a single macrophage chemoattractant. These results have been extended to mice with encephalitis caused by virulent strains of jHMV. Although CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are both required for virus clearance 100 , partial abrogation of the CD4 + T cell response (by mutating the immunodominant CD4 + T cell epitope rj.M Y135Q ) results in disease amelioration, and virulence is regained if another CD4 + T cell epitope is reintroduced into the rj.M Y135Q genome 101 . Thus acute encephalitis, like chronic demyelination, is at least partially mediated by the immune system. Similar processes may occur in SARS-CoV-infected humans, as pulmonary disease often worsens at 1-2 weeks after onset of respiratory symptoms, concomitant with the onset of virus clearance 1 . Although worsening clinical disease occurring as a consequence of virus clearance has not been duplicated in any animal model of SARS, the severe disease observed in older patients can be mimicked in SARS-CoV-infected aged mice [102] [103] [104] . This has been attributed, in part, to a suboptimal T cell response resulting in delayed kinetics of virus clearance. A suboptimal T cell response, occurring as a consequence of infection of macrophages or dendritic cells, may also be critical for the immunopathological lethal disease that is observed in FIPV-infected felines 71 .

The N protein of MHV inhibits activator protein 1 (AP1) signalling and protein kinase R (PKR) function, whereas the N protein of SARS-CoV also inhibits nuclear factor-\u03baB activation [108] [109] [110] when expressed in transfection assays. Whether these inhibitory functions of the N protein are coronavirus or cell-type specific, and whether they occur in infected cells, remains to be determined. The ORF6 protein inhibits IFN signalling by binding to karyopherin-\u03b12, thereby tethering karyopherin-\u03b2 to cytoplasmic membranes 114 . This, in turn, prevents nuclear translocation of proteins containing classical nuclear import signals 115 SARS-CoV and MHV nsp1 function, at least in part, by degrading host cell mRNA and inhibiting translation [111] [112] [113] 117 . Nsp1 also inhibits IFN signalling in both SARS-CoV-and MHV-infected cells, in part by inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation 112, 113 . Mutation of nsp1 attenuates SARS-CoV and MHV growth in mice and tissue culture cells in the presence of an intact IFN system, but not when IFN function is deficient [111] [112] [113] . Nsp3 is also an IFN antagonist, and it inhibits phosphorylation and nuclear importation of IRF3 (ref. 118) .",

Mice, cats, ferrets, macaques and civet cats are all susceptible to SARS-CoV, but none, with the exception of aged mice, develop severe disease (reviewed in ref. 129) . In efforts to develop models that closely mimic human disease, mice that are transgenic for the expression of human ACE2 were developed and infected with SARS-CoV 130, 131 . Although these mice develop more severe pulmonary disease than nontransgenic mice, they also develop an overwhelming neuronal infection, accompanied by high cytokine and/ or chemokine expression and minimal cellular infiltration in the brain 132 . Although the severity of the brain infection observed in human ACE2 transgenic mice is greater than that seen in human patients, infection of this organ has been detected in some studies and patients who survived SARS had a greater incidence of neurological and psychiatric sequelae than anticipated 63, 133, 134 . The high susceptibility of these mice to infection with SARS-CoV makes them useful for vaccine and therapeutic trials. Another approach to developing an animal model for SARS was to adapt the virus by passage 10-15 times through the lungs of BALB/c mice or rats 103, 135, 136 . Three to six mutations were detected in the adapted viruses, with changes most commonly observed in the S protein and in nsp5 (3CL pro ). The adapted virus caused extensive pulmonary infection and disease was most severe in aged animals. These viruses will be useful for studies of pathogenesis and for vaccine and therapeutic trials. Some models have been tested on the genomic and proteomic level. Studies of SARS-CoV infected macaques showed that several chemokines and/or cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10 and CCL2, as well as IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3, were upregulated 137 . These animals recovered, showing that the same inflammatory mediators that are associated with severe human disease are also produced as part of the inflammatory response in animals that mount an appropriate response. Genomics studies of mice infected with the urbani strain of SARS-CoV showed continued expression of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TNF, CXCL10 and CCL2, accompanied by slower kinetics of virus clearance and worse outcomes in aged compared to young animals 138 , paralleling disease patterns in patients with SARS 119 . These two studies also showed changes in expression of proteins that are involved in cell growth, cycling, cell-to-cell signalling and development and death. It will be important to determine whether these changes are useful as a 'fingerprint' for SARS or whether they represent generalized responses to pulmonary stress.",

The virus frequently spread to animal handlers in these markets, but caused minimal or no disease. Further adaptation resulted in strains that replicated efficiently in the human host, caused disease and could spread from person to person. b | Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are closely related and it is thought that the virus originated in one species and then crossed species. BCoV has also spread to numerous other animals, such as alpaca and wild ruminants. c | Feline coronavirus I (FCoV-I) and canine coronavirus I (CCoV-I) are thought to share a common ancestor. CCoV-I underwent recombination with an unknown coronavirus to give rise to canine coronavirus II (CCoV-II). CCoV-II in turn underwent recombination with FCoV-I (in an unknown host) to give rise to feline coronavirus II (FCoV-II). CCoV-II probably also spread to pigs, resulting in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). One future goal will be to further delineate how the virus evades the immune response and better understand its interaction with the T and B cell responses, both in the original host (bats), in which disease appears to be mild, and in humans and experimentally infected animals. Figure 6 | inefficient activation of the type 1 interferon response, and immunopathological disease, in coronavirus infections. a | Coronaviruses, as exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), induce a type 1 interferon (IFN) response in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and macrophages, via TLR7-and MDA5-dependent pathways, respectively. b | IFN\u03b1 and/or IFN\u03b2 is not produced in either SARS-CoV fibroblasts or DCs, partly because coronavirus macromolecules appear to be invisible to immune sensors. Additionally, coronaviruses encode proteins that actively inhibit IFN\u03b1 and/or IFN\u03b2 expression (such as nucleocapsid (N) protein, nsp3, ORF6 and ORF3b) or signalling through the type 1 IFN receptor (such as N, nsp1, ORF6 and ORF3b). c | Consequently, the kinetics of virus clearance is delayed, with subsequent robust T and B cell and cytokine and/or chemokine responses. d | This pro-inflammatory response results in immunopathological disease that occurs during the process of virus clearance. In MHV-infected mice, virus clearance involves recruitment of activated macrophages and microglia to sites of virus infection, leading to demyelination. Similar mechanisms with exuberant cytokine production may function in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected humans, leading to severe pulmonary disease (adult respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS).
