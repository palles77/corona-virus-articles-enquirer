Sequences corresponding to the viral nucleocapsid region were amplified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from the cortex, dura mater, pancreas, lungs, third eyelid, and the heart muscle in four cases. Interestingly, the ORF7b viral region -a supposed virulence factor -was detected in fewer organs, raising the possibility that this region can be affected by deletions during virus replication in vivo.",

Regarding their pathogenicity, FCoV comprise two biotypes: feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) viruses (FIPV) and feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV; Pedersen 1987) . Based on in-vitro neutralisation using monoclonal antibodies, the existence of at least two serotypes of FCoV (type I and II) has been shown. Each serotype contains viruses of both the FIPV and FECV biotype (Hohdatsu et al 1991a,b) . Type I and II viruses differ in their in vitro growth characteristics (Pedersen 1987) and importantly, in the composition of their spike protein (Herrewegh et al 1998) . In the field, the prevalence of FCoV type I seems to be higher, since about 70 per cent of FIP cases are due to infection with type I viruses (Hohdatsu et al 1992) .",

The diagnosis of the disease is rather complicated, and therefore it represents one of the major pet animal health problems that still remains to be solved. Thus, serological data on their own are not always informative (Olsen 1993) in diagnosis. Vaccines may not provide protection since they may even induce accelerated pathogenesis and early death, associated with antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (Vennema et al 1990 , Harvey et al 1996 . Nevertheless, a commercially available vaccine has shown promising results (Fehr et al 1997) . FECV is not considered a direct cause of morbidity in cats. It may produce mild enteritis but most experimental and natural infections remain subclinical. However, it presents a considerable health risk to cats because it has been revealed that it is the parent of FIPV (Foley et al 1997b , Vennema et al 1998 .",

For instance, it has been demonstrated that type II feline coronaviruses have arisen from an RNA recombination event between canine coronavirus and a type I feline coronavirus (Herrewegh et al 1998) . Further observations indicate that deletions in different parts of the FECV genome may be responsible for the formation of FIP viruses (Vennema et al 1998) . However, the mechanism of these events is not totally understood. It is known that type I FECV can establish persistent infection in cats when the virus replicates in the enterocytes of the crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn in the large intestine . During virus replication, the specific changes in the viral genome may lead to the development of the highly pathogenic FIP viruses and consequently, manifestation of the disease. Possibly a malfunction of the immune system contributes to this process (Poland et al 1996) .",

On PID 80 the cats were killed and gross and histopathological examinations were carried out. The following tissue samples were collected for RT-PCR: brain cortex, medulla oblongata, dura mater, liver, kidneys, spleen, lymph nodes, lungs, small and large intestines, pancreas, third eyelid and heart muscle. From the organ samples, 10 per cent (w/v) suspensions were prepared in double-distilled water and then centrifuged at 7000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes. The supernatants were used immediately for RNA extraction or stored at -70\u00b0C.",

            "text": "A crucial step in the pathogenesis of FIP is when certain virus variants leave the intestines and reach different organs (Pedersen et al 1981) . It is not known how long this process takes or which conditions are required for this event. The present experiment showed that despite the relatively short observation period of 80 days, in one cat FCoV apparently invaded different organs. Considering the suggestions of Pedersen et al (1981) , this may be an important step in the development of FIP. It is interesting that the N and ORF7b-PCR assays gave identical results when the swab and large intestine samples were tested. However, in the case of additional organs, the N-PCR scored considerably more positive samples. An obvious explanation would be the different sensitivity of the two systems. This is not likely, however, considering that the two assays yielded identical results not only on the swab and large intestine samples, but also when serial dilutions of FCoV and clinical specimens were tested. We therefore hypothesise that the viruses detected in the cats could presumably have their ORF7b region affected by deletion(s). Such a phenomenon was reported for avirulent, tissue culture adapted feline coronaviruses and it was concluded that the loss of virulence was associated with the deletions in the ORF7b region (de Groot and Horzinek 1995). According to Vennema et al (1998) , as well as being a virulence factor the presence of this region is an advantage for the virus replication. Therefore, this phenomenon should be investigated further, both in vitro and in vivo, and studies should also involve the ORF3c region which is considered to exert a regulatory effect on the ORF7b (Vennema et al 1998) .",

            "text": "The quasispecies nature of the members of the Coronaviridae family has been well documented, mainly for murine coronaviruses (Makino et al 1986 , Baric et al 1990 , Holland et al 1992 , Lai 1996 . The present study revealed that FCoV also comprised virus subpopulations. However, there were differences in the prevalence of viral subpopulations between body compartments, i.e., not all variants present in the swab samples were present in the organ samples, and some variants were more prevalent in the organ samples than in the large intestine. Additionally, during in vivo replication, the SSCP patterns of the N region showed higher variability than the ORF7b region. These findings suggest that presumably only selected virus variants became able to leave the large intestine and invade the blood circulation and different organs. It appears, however, that the selection pressure is not on the N gene, since the predominant subpopulations (the master sequences) could be demonstrated in each N-PCR positive organ specimen. Nevertheless, presumably a new selection process takes place in every infected organ that may result in a virus quasispecies that is different in composition from that which originally replicated in the large intestine. This process, in conjunction with the relatively impaired reaction of the respective immune response of particular cats could eventually lead to the development of FIP. The present study demonstrated that FCoV is able to establish chronic enteric infection in cats. The data indicate that the viruses undergo continuous but subtle changes during the chronic replication, and that the extent of variation and the composition of the viral quasispecies is not the same in the different organs. Additionally, even neighbouring genomic regions showed distinct variability: the N region varied more than the ORF7b region.",

The exact information on ORF7b and its product, the gp7b, should reveal the role of the region in the development of FIP. In conclusion, this study provided information concerning alternations in the genome of FCoV during in vivo replication. It was shown that the composition of the viral quasispecies differs between organs, and that genomic regions with different functions undergo distinct processes of selection, which should be considered during the evolution of feline coronaviruses. Future investigations will aim to determine the significance of the changes of particular viral genomic regions. Beyond this, the immune responses against FCoV infections and the probable impairment of these functions, that eventually participate in the pathogenesis of FIP, will be elaborated.",
