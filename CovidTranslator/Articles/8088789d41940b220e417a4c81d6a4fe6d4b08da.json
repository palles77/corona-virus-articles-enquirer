The pathogenic properties of two isolates were studied in 13 experimentally infected cats. The primary phase of infection was characterised by a range of haematological (neutropenia, lymphopenia, presence of atypical lymphocytes) and clinical alterations (fever, various signs lasting several weeks, generalised lymphadenopathy persisting for several months) and specific seroconversion. A correlation between the inoculated dose of virus and the intensity and duration of clinical signs was observed. The primary phase was followed in the 10 surviving cats by a stage of asymptomatic seropositivity of undetermined duration but which has persisted for over 35 months for the earliest infections. Viruses reisolated several weeks or months after experimental infection retained the same in vitro properties as the initial isolates.",

Heparinised blood obtained by jugular venipuncture was separated on a Ficollsodium diatrizoate gradient (Histopaque-1077, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) layer was removed, washed 3 times in PBS buffer and resuspended to a concentration of 10 6 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 medium containing HEPES buffer, 10% foetal bovine serum, 5 /tg/ml concanavalin A (Con A ), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100/zg/ml dihydrostreptomycin. Three days after Con A-stimulation, the non-adherent lymphocyte-rich cell fraction was removed, centrifuged and resuspended in fresh culture medium to the same concentration. Cocultures were prepared by mixing equal volumes of 3-day Con A-stimulated PBMC cultures, one of which was prepared from a cat suspected to be infected by FIV and the other from a normal cat; recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL2) (Genzyme, Boston, MA, USA) was added to in the medium ( 100 U/ml). Pedersen et al. (1987) and Harbour et al. (1988) reported that 7-d old cultures obtained under these conditions contained 95-97% T-lymphocytes. On day 7, the flasks were enriched with 3-d Con A-stimulated PBMC from a heathy cat as follows: the content of flask ( 8 ml) was centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in 2 ml of complete medium. Simultaneously a fresh 3-d Con A-stimulated culture (8 ml adjusted to 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml) was resuspended in the same manner; the two fractions were then mixed together and the volume brought to 8 ml. This operation was repeated four times at intervals of 7 d.",

These clinical disorders peaked around the seventh week and were associated in some cats with localized infections (conjunctivitis, rhinitis, diarrhoea, gingivitis and infestation with ear mites). In three cats the clinical course was particularly severe: cat Et died abruptly 7 weeks p.i. following 48 h of depression and pronounced pallor of the mucous membranes and, although the cause of death was not determined in this animal, specific seroconversion was established; cat Ne started to present general signs associated with rhinitis and conjunctivitis from day 38 p.i., and, at the seventh week, extreme depression and agranulocytosis (Fig. 1 ) prompted a decision to euthanase the animal. Post-mortem examination revealed severe hyperthrophy of ileocecal lymph nodes and a slight congestion of the small intestine. Histological examination of this organ revealed no lesions consistent with infectious panleukopenia and the absence of parvovirus in the faeces ruled out this possibility; cat Gu developed a variety of clinical signs 3 weeks after inoculation which remained severe for 2 months (Tables 4 and 5; Fig. 1 Table 2 2Reverse transcriptase activity (cpm \u00d7 10-3 ) 3post-inoculation 4No tested It may be noted that in HIV infection, the stage I (primary infection corresponding to seroconver-sion) is also followed by a stage II of asymptomatic seropositivity (Centers for Disease Control, 1986) . About half the cats (Table 4 ) developed fever which persisted for about three weeks; although moderate in most cases, fever on occasion reached 40 \u00b0 C and was sometimes recurrent. As shown in Table 4 , the intensity of fever and other clinical signs were evaluated by a \"clinical score\" varying from 0 to + + + (death or severe clinical signs).",

Agranulocytosis associated with a shorter phase of lymphopenia was observed in cat Ne (Table 5 and Fig. 1 ). An inversion of the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio was presented by 10/11 cats and only cat Do developed no haematological disorders. The neutropenic phase was associated with the presence in the blood of large mononuclear cells exhibiting basophilic cytoplasm and irregularly shaped round nuclei with loose reticulate chromatin and one or two prominent nucleolis; these atypical lymphocytes were classified as immunoblasttype cells (Fig. 2 ) . A correlation between the number of atypical lymphocytes and the severity of the clinical expression was observed for cat Gu in which the proportion of atypical cells reached 80% of lymphocytes at the peak of each neutropenic episode. It may be noted that the presence of LA associated with atypical lymphoid cells has been reported in man during HIV infection at time of seroconversion (Cooper et al., 1985 ) and also at the acute stage of infectious mononucleosis (Tursz et al., 1980) . The absence of neutrophil counts in several reports concerning the HIV primary infection makes it difficult to establish whether the neutropenia observed in the cat manifests as systematically in the human subject.",

With regard to RT activity in cocultures, it is accepted that the times to appearance depend on the number of infected cells in the PBMC infected fraction. If it can be taken that the number of infected peripheral lymphocytes during the leucopenic phase preceding seroconversion is about the same for all cats, it would be of interest to compare the in vitro properties of differents strains isolated at this particular stage of infection. In this condition the RT activity was 0 at day 7 and 5 at day 14 with the Petaluma strain and respectively 120 and 190 in cocultures prepared from cat Gu 2 months p.i. (Table 3 ). In conclusion, the viruses Wo and Me isolated from two differents cats at the final stage of infection were characterised by a high replication rate and a rapidly induced CPE. The differences in in vitro replication rates between HIV isolates have led investigators to suggest the possibility of the existence of variants. Thus, strains isolated from patients with advanced disease rapidly displayed high RT activity (Asj6, 1986 ) were able to replicate efficiently and to induce syncytium-formation (Fenyti, 1988) . Moreover, high-replicating and syncytium-inducing isolates were associated with a decrease in the number of T4-1ymphocytes and a rapid progression to AIDS (Tersmette, 1989) . It is generally considered that during the course of human infection pathogenic variants are progressively selected and that they become clearly predominant at the end of the disease. In our work, 3 high-replicating and syncytium-inducing isolates were recovered from cats at the terminal stage of infection with feline AIDS (that is at the most favourable time for isolation of the most highly pathogenic strains). The present data suggest that there may exist an heterogeneity among FIV strains and a relationship between the clinical condition of the donor at the time of isolation and the in vitro growth characteristics of the strain obtained.",
