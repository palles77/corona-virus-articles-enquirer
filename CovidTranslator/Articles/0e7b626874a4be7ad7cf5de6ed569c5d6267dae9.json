STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study conducted from 6 March 2014 to 3 May 2016 on infants evaluated for LOS. PCR viral panel performed on nasopharyngeal specimens among infants with clinical suspicion for RVI. Sequence analysis was performed to determine viral subtypes. Fisher's exact or \u03c7 2 tests were done to determine the impact of RVI. RESULTS: During the 26-month study, there were 357 blood cultures obtained for LOS evaluations, 29 (8%) had a respiratory virus detected. Only 88 (25%) of infants evaluated for LOS also had clinical suspicion for a respiratory viral infection. RSV (14 of 29; 48%) was the predominant virus detected. Almost all infants (13 of 14; 93%) with RSV required increased respiratory support. Antimicrobial therapy was withheld or discontinued on most infants with a virus detected (18 of 29; 62%) and in the majority where there was no confirmed bacterial co-infection (18 of 20; 90%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of RVI in infants being evaluated for LOS is about 8%. RVI should be considered in LOS evaluation to prevent unnecessary antibiotic therapy.",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infection (RVI) may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality among infants presenting with sepsis. Significant illness in both preterm 1 and full-term 2 infants have been described with RVI. Several respiratory viral pathogens, including coronaviruses, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus have been reported as possible causes of late-onset sepsis (LOS). [3] [4] [5] These viruses are associated with increased length of hospital stay, severe disease, unnecessary antimicrobial exposure and nosocomial outbreaks in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). [5] [6] [7] RVI is often underdiagnosed, unrecognized or infrequently examined as a cause of sepsis in infants because of several challenges: the wide range of clinical presentations and their similarity to bacterial infections 8 and the unreliable methodology previously used for RVI detection which lacked sensitivity and specificity. 3 The introduction of new molecular-based assays has paved the way for accurate detection of viral pathogens as a cause of sepsis in infants. The use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology allows for prompt and more reliable detection of viral infection. [3] [4] [5] 9, 10 Clinical suspicion for RVI promotes the detection of viral pathogens 4 using PCR technology, enhancing early recognition and facilitating the initiation of appropriate antiviral treatment 11 or prophylactic regimens. 3 Furthermore, it facilitates the withholding or discontinuation of unnecessary antimicrobial therapy, contributing to NICU-specific stewardship initiatives 12 as well as outbreak prevention. 5 The objective of this study was to determine the frequency, etiology and impact of RVI on term and preterm infants evaluated for LOS in the NICU with clinical suspicion for viral infection.",

Our NICU is a 60-bed (private room) level IV regional perinatal center with~800 annual admissions,~150 with a birthweight below 1500 g. The study population included any infant admitted to the NICU for LOS evaluation with an associated concern for RVI, regardless of gestational age or medical and surgical comorbidities. Admissions to the NICU include all inborn infants less than 35 weeks' gestation, infants transferred from another facility within our region, recently discharged preterm infants and infants greater than 35 weeks' with significant illness requiring intensive care up to 30 days of life. Each episode of LOS was counted individually. Infants evaluated for sepsis had a CBC and blood culture was obtained as well as additional tests such as a C-reactive protein (CRP), cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) studies, tracheal aspirate or urine cultures deemed necessary by the medical team based on the infant's clinical presentation. For infants with clinical suspicion for RVI, a nasopharyngeal specimen was obtained for PCR testing. The caregiver's clinical suspicion of viral infection had been described previously as the best predictor of RVI and respiratory signs indicative of infection had been defined extensively elsewhere. 4 The PCR test was ordered at the discretion of the clinical team as well as empiric 1 antimicrobial coverage pending bacterial culture and/or PCR test results for at least 48 h.",

Eight infants were excluded from the review for reasons outlined in Figure 1 and 48 were not included with limited or no sepsis evaluation. During the study period 357 blood cultures were obtained for LOS evaluations; only 88 (25%) of these evaluations included a respiratory viral panel. The demographics and baseline characteristics of infants included in the study are outlined in Table 1 . There was no significant difference in gender or day of life in LOS evaluations for infants with or without a respiratory virus detected. There were, however, significant differences in gestational age, birthweight, evaluation during birth hospitalization and diagnosis of chronic lung disease. These differences may be attributed to the admission of older term infants and the readmission of recently discharged premature infants requiring intensive care support. Cough, nasal congestion, increased work of breathing, lethargy and poor feeding were the statistically significant clinical presentations of infants that prompted concern for RVI and with a respiratory virus detected ( Table 2 ). There were a total of 357 LOS evaluations, 29 (8%) had a respiratory virus detected. In the 88 evaluations studied with clinical suspicion for RVI, 29 (33%) were positive for a respiratory virus.

The incidence of viral infections in the NICU has been reported to range from 1% 20 to as high as 52% over a 12-month surveillance period for RVI. 5 Our findings corroborate with Ronchi et al. 4 and Kidszun et al., 21 in which a respiratory virus was detected in 6 and 6.8%, respectively, in infants undergoing evaluation for LOS. Our study differs in that only 88 of 357 (25%) infants evaluated for LOS also had a respiratory viral panel obtained. In this group, 62 of 88 (70%) were preterm infants and 18 of 62 (29%) tested positive for a respiratory virus. This is in stark contrast to 52% of prematurely born infants in the cohort followed by Bennett et al. 5 Our finding is comparable to the report by Diniz et al. 21 and Kujari et al., 22 in which respiratory viruses were diagnosed in 29.5 and 20%, respectively. A high index of suspicion remains the cornerstone in diagnosing respiratory viral infections in infants, 4,23,24,30 prompting the use of the viral PCR panel. Similar clinical findings (cough, congestion and increased work of breathing) were described in our study on infants who had a respiratory virus detected; however, non-specific symptoms such as lethargy and poor feeding were also noted among infants with RVI. In comparing preterm infants to term infants with RVI, the presence of apnea (67 vs 9%, P o0.01) and the need for increased respiratory support (94 vs 64%, P = 0.03) were significantly higher in the preterm group, whereas fever (0 vs 55%, P o 0.01) was the predominant symptom in-term infants with RVI.

In a retrospective review by Ronchi et al., 11 disseminated neonatal adenoviral infection was associated with significant mortality and morbidity. In a recent case report, premature neonate being treated for 'culture-negative sepsis' was diagnosed with disseminated adenoviral infection late in the disease course, which was ultimately fatal 22 increasing the clinician's awareness of utilizing the viral panel when LOS is suspected. An outbreak of parainfluenza 3 had been reported in seven preterm infants with a spectrum of presentation that consisted of apnea, bradycardia, flu-like illness and progressive respiratory distress. 23 RhV has been associated with nosocomial outbreaks in preterm infants causing significant respiratory compromise. 1, 24, 26 RSV has been implicated in numerous outbreaks leading to severe disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome or even death. 7 There was no evidence of clustering or concern for outbreak of RSV in about half of the respiratory virus cases detected in our study.",

Silva et al. 27 reported on the impact of the early identification of an index case of RSV, leading to cohorting exposed preterm infants and the use of palivizumab prophylaxis, thus preventing the development of new cases. In an era when there is significant variation in the prescribing practice in the NICU, 28 microbiologic information may help clinicians in withholding or discontinuing antibiotics. Antibiotic use was withheld or discontinued in the majority (62%) of infants undergoing sepsis evaluations and in all infants with limited evaluations when a respiratory virus is detected in our cohort. The use of molecular assays has been recommended to confirm respiratory viral infections in infants 3, 4 and to assist with the antibiotic stewardship infrastructure in the NICU. 12 If available in a medical center, respiratory viral PCR test should be used judiciously if the caregiver has clinical suspicion for RVI. 4 Strengths and limitations The major strength of this prospective observational study is utilizing the respiratory viral panel as part of the evaluation for LOS in the NICU. It allowed providers to use their clinical suspicion in using available respiratory viral PCR panel on infants undergoing sepsis evaluations. This study not only confirms the importance of considering RVI among infants undergoing sepsis evaluations 4, 22, 29 but demonstrates that in the majority of patients antibiotic therapy was withheld or discontinued when a respiratory virus was detected.",

This may explain why we did not find a significant difference in the need for mechanical ventilation in infants when a respiratory virus was detected or not. Increasing the number of infants enrolled involving several medical centers with a NICU would allow examining disease severity associated with specific viral types or subtypes.
