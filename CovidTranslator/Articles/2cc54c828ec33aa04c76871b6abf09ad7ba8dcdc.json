            "text": "Consequently, a patient with ILD, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a positive test result for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) would not have been considered to have ssSSc. ANA positivity can occur in IPF patients, and thus we did not solely rely on this in our analysis. Rather, we highlighted the specificity of nucleolar staining for ANAs. 3 In fact, in our previously described cohort of IPF subjects who were anti-Th/To-positive, we argued that, on retrospective analysis, those with ANAs revealed by nucleolar staining, and particularly those with Th/To antibodies, appeared to have had ssSSc-ILD. 4 Dr. Singh states that antitopoisomerase antibodies have been reported in patients with IPF and suggests this could produce a nucleolar staining ANA. A closer review of the referenced article shows that 18 of 41 IPF patients (44%) had antibodies to DNA topoisomerase II. 5 However, only 3 of the 18 patients had a positive ANA finding obtained by Hep2 cell substrate, and the pattern of immunofluorescence was not reported. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the presence of antitopoisomerase II antibodies in IPF patients has not been confirmed by another group, although it has been reported in Japanese patients with SSc-ILD. 6 Additionally, antitopoisomerase II antibodies should not be confused with antitopoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) antibodies, which are highly specific for diffuse SSc and give a nucleolar pattern on ANA testing. Notably in our study, while all six patients had ANAs revealed by nucleolar staining, only one patient showed antitopoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) antibodies. We believe that our case definition for ssSSc-ILD accurately differentiates those patients with ssSSc from those with IPF, and that this distinction is clinically useful.",

However, I believe the authors do a disservice by unequivocally declaring that their data allows the demarcation of \"a zone of potential aerosol infection with an extra margin of safety.\" They would do well to temper this conclusion based on theoretical arguments from a mechanical model with those based on published in vivo observations 2 in humans that clearly demonstrate aerosolized particles traveling, not 30 or 40, but hundreds of centimeters.",

As we pointed out in our article, our human lung model simply reflected a baseline estimate of the distance traveled by any potentially infectious aerosols while the patient was breathing at rest with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min. With appropriate references, 2,3 we have already stressed the importance of full personal protective equipment as an effective infection control measure in protecting health-care workers against severe acute respiratory syndrome. 1 We are well aware of the possibility that viral infection such as severe acute respiratory syndrome has the potential of spreading by an airborne route, and indeed our institution has made a significant contribution to the literature on this issue. 4, 5 It is important for clinicians involved in the management of infectious diseases to understand that environmental factors such as medical ward airflow and ventilation may play a significant role in the aerosol transmission of infection in health-care premises. 6 In addition to full personal protective equipment and good personal hygiene, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended in influenza pandemic plans enhanced infection control precautions in health-care facilities, including placing patients with suspected and confirmed H5N1 influenza in negative-pressure isolation rooms with 6 to 12 air exchanges per hour (if available) due to the high lethality of the disease and uncertainty about the mode of human to human transmission. 7, 8 The negative-pressure room will reduce the spread of airborne contamination between rooms, and a recent study 9 has shown that the air exchange rate and airflow patterns are important factors in the control of airborne virus infection, and good ventilation arrangement may enhance the safety of staff when performing medical treatments within isolation rooms.",
