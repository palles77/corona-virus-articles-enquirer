They are produced by immune cells, such as dendritic cells 3 , NK cells 4 and T lymphocytes 5, 6 , and non-immune cells 7 including endothelial cells 8 , fibroblasts 9,10 , stromal cells 11, 12 et al. Cytokines play important roles in immune responses, inflammation and carcinogenesis [13] [14] [15] [16] . EGF (epidermal growth factor) 17 , VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 18 and HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) 19 have significant effects on oncogenesis, and they have been developed as targets for tumor therapy. On the other hand, some cytokines function as tumor suppressors, preventing and suppressing the development of cancer 20 , such as oncostatin M (OSM) 21 and interleukin-24 (IL-24) 22 . OSM is a multifunctional interleukin 6-related cytokine, which inhibits the proliferation of various solid tumor cell lines. IL-24 is a cytokine tumor suppressor, which was identified initially as a melanoma differentiation-associated molecule. IL-24 is one of the IL-10 family cytokines and inhibits tumor cell growth, invasion, and migration by inducing tumor cell apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest with down-regulation of Cyclin D. IL-24 is significantly down-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared with that in the adjacent normal mucosa with post-transcriptional modifications 23 .",

            "text": "CRC represents the third most common cancer in the world 24 . Its development is a multistage process characterized by a complex interaction between genetic alterations and host immune system 25, 26 . Proto-oncogenes, including K-ras and c-myc 27 , play important roles in colorectal carcinogenesis. On the other hand, tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) 28, 29 , such as p16, p21, p27, p53, APC, DCC, and MMR, are also of great importance during this process. TSGs inhibit unrestrained cell division in normal cells and limit tumor cell growth by decelerating cell division, repairing DNA mistakes and inducing programmed cell death. However, loss of function or decreased expression of TSGs, which is caused by genetic mutation, allele deletion, promoter methylation, or other mechanisms, may contribute to the development of uncontrolled cell growth of cancer. CRC can be treated with surgery in its early stages 30 , but it usually metastasizes at the time of diagnosis, which requires chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy is not very effective in the presence of metastasis, with survival rates lower than 10%. Taking together, failure of early diagnosis and therapy resistance are the major causes of death from CRC [31] [32] [33] .",

Avastin inhibits growth of blood vessels by blocking VEGF, and Erbitux reduces growth of cancer by binding EGFR. A phase I clinical trial using a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing IL-24 (Ad-IL24/INGN241) reported that Ad-IL24 treatment had measurable tumor-killing effects in over 40% of patients 37 .

It has the highest expression level in normal colon tissue and decreases in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. CSBF/C10orf99 interacts with SUSD2 to inhibit colon cancer cell growth and induce G1 cell cycle arrest by down-regulating cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). It shows a bellshaped activity curve with the maximal effect at ,10 ng/ml and sSUSD2-Fc soluble protein can block its function.

The green fluorescence signals revealed that CSBF-EGFP also had a cytoplasmic localization. There was no signal presented on cell membrane or in the nucleus.

Then we examined subcellular localization of these mutants in LoVo cells. Supplementary Figure S2c showed different expression patterns of full length SUSD2 and all these mutants. Compared with the wild type of SUSD2, all these mutants are abundant in cytoplasm, suggesting that absence of any of these four domains would change the localization of this protein, which may further affect its function. So the following studies only included the function of intact SUSD2 protein.",

These results suggest that co-expressing of CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 might induce G1 cell cycle arrest. We further examined several key cell cycle regulators by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 6c , cyclin D1, cyclin D3 and CDK6 were down-regulated in CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2 co-expressing LoVo cells, consistent with the phenotypes of G1 cell cycle arrest.

GEO profile analysis showed that 2610528A11Rik, the mouse homolog of CSBF/C10orf99, was significantly up-regulated in psoriasis mouse models (GDS3907). Moreover, CSBF/C10orf99 was also up-regulated in psoriasis patients (GDS3539). Meanwhile CSBF/C10orf99 was speculated to be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis 50 , which is a chronic immunological skin and joint disease, traditionally believed to be involved in the Th1 pathway. By challenging of ovalbumin, Tang et al. reported that the homozygous 2610528A11Rik knockout mice exhibited an increased mean serum IgG2a response 51 , which is an immunoglobulin isotype marker for T helper 1 (Th1) lymphocytes associated function, indicating that 2610528A11Rik might inhibit Th1 cells to regulate adaptive immune responses. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the function of CSBF/C10orf99 in Th1 cell immune responses. The expressional and functional characteristics of CSBF/C10orf99 indicate it may be a tumor suppressor. Its gene is located on chromosome 10q23.1 beside the genomic region of tumor suppressor PTEN (10q23.3) 52 . Inactivation of TSGs through promoter methylation, gene mutation, or loss of heterozygosity is important for carcinogenesis. In human colon cancer cell lines, the expression of CSBF/ C10orf99 cannot be restored by Aza or combined with TSA, which indicates that it is not regulated by promoter methylation. The mechanism underlying the down-regulation of CSBF/C10orf99 remains to be studied further. Possible roles for genetic and/or other epigenetic controls must be considered. The promoter of SUSD2 contains nontypical CpG islands, but it can be restored by Aza or combined with TSA, indicating that promoter methylation manipulates its expression directly or transcription factors regulating its expression are epigenetically regulated.",

There are some possible mechanisms to elucidate why p16 overexpression occurs. On one hand, partial loss of p16 function due to missense mutations can be compensated by elevated expression as observed in some tumor specimens. On the other hand, in the presence of wild-type p16, other molecular events, such as over-expression of CDC6 and cyclin D1, or deregulation of Rb in tumor cells and cancer tissues have the potential to positively feedback p16 expression 53, 54 . Given these available mechanisms and our results, there might be some mutations of CSBF/C10orf99 and SUSD2, or other downstream molecules changing in the mentioned samples.",

Watson et al. reported that SUSD2 interacts with Gal1 and the cell surface localization of Gal1 is dependent on the existence of SUSD2 44 . The interaction of SUSD2 with Gal1 increased the invasion of breast cancer cells and might play a significant role in modulating the body's immune response. GEO profile analysis showed that SUSD2 was significantly down-regulated in estrogen receptor (ER) alphasilenced breast cancer cells (GDS4061), and it was up-regulated in ER positive cells (GDS4067) and some ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (GDS3592). Meanwhile, Gal1 is the reported ligand of SUSD2 and involved in tumor transformation, angiogenesis, cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis 57 . Our results showed that the affinity between CSBF/ C10orf99 and SUSD2 is similar to that of Gal-1 and SUSD2, but the functions are different. Collectively, these results suggest that the expression and function of SUSD2 might be influenced by estrogen, ligands and microenvironment.",
