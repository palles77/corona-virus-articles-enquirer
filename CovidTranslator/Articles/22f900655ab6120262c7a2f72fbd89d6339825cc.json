            "text": "The use of highly sensitive molecular diagnostics, including polymerase chain reactionbased respiratory viral panels (RVPs), to identify potential pathogens among children with pneumonia has increased substantially. 1 Although such testing is highly sensitive, it is not always clear whether organisms detected from the nasopharynx are true lower tract pathogens. 2 Furthermore, detection of a virus does not exclude the possibility of bacterial coinfection, complicating the use of RVP results for making antibiotic decisions. Several studies examining whether such testing influences clinical management have found conflicting results. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Whether RVP testing can inform our understanding of disease severity is largely unexplored. These are important considerations given the not insubstantial cost of testing. In this study, we examined the association between results of an RVP and antibiotic use as well as clinical outcomes (length of stay [LOS] , intensive care admission, respiratory support, and mechanical ventilation) among previously healthy children hospitalized with pneumonia. .0, 488.11) who also had an RVP performed within 24 hours of admission. We restricted testing to the first 24 hours of admission to identify children in whom testing was ordered as part of the initial evaluation. Children with \u22651 complex chronic conditions were excluded by using a previously described algorithm. 8 Details regarding each hospitalization, including laboratory and microbiologic testing; need for respiratory support, intensive care admission, or mechanical ventilation; parenteral antimicrobial use; and hospital LOS were collected from Vanderbilt's Electronic Data Warehouse, the Medipac charge database, and medical record review by a member of the study team (GS). The RVP used has been previously described. 6 The test was introduced institution-wide in August 2009, and clinicians were informed of its availability through email. During this time, testing was performed Monday through Friday, with results available in \u226424 hours.",

Other studies have demonstrated similar results, finding that virus-positive children were more often hypoxic and had increased need for intensive care. 9, 12 However, our study also suggests that the more severe course seen among many RVP-positive children is driven largely by RSV. In contrast, children with detections for rhinovirus/enterovirus were no different from RVP-negative children. Additionally, although we observed frequent, severe complications among children with other viruses such as influenza or parainfluenza, our study size limits the conclusions we can draw regarding these less commonly detected viruses.",

A similar study examining the temporal relationship between treatment decisions and RVP results found that few children had antibiotics discontinued even after a positive RVP result was obtained. 7 Notably, RVP testing was ordered in <20% of children who met other study criteria, and those tested had more severe illness, with a high proportion of children requiring intensive care. In these critically ill children, there is hesitancy to withhold antibiotics even if viral testing identifies a pathogen because it is difficult to exclude the possibility of bacterial coinfection. 4 Conversely, RVP testing could play a more beneficial role in less severely ill patients and allow for a \"watchful waiting\" approach with regard to antibiotics when viral testing is positive. In 2 large studies of children with acute respiratory illnesses, including 1 randomized trial, clinicians initiated antibiotics significantly less frequently in children who had RVP testing performed, suggesting that clinicians may indeed defer antibiotics in selected populations when viral testing results are rapidly available. 5, 7 Given the high prevalence of viral etiology among children with pneumonia, expanded viral testing that leads to meaningful reductions in antibiotic use could help slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance and facilitate cost savings.",

Thus, there is potential benefit associated with viral testing at both the individual and population levels. However, there is more uncertainty when other viruses are implicated because some, such as rhinovirus, are also frequently recovered from asymptomatic children. 2, 13, 14 The utility of RVP testing is also hampered by the typical turnaround time of 24 to 48 hours. Rapid, point-of-care testing may have more impact on resource utilization. 15, 16 Similarly, any benefits derived from an RVP must also be weighed against the not insubstantial cost of testing. 1 With these limitations in mind, an alternative strategy might include more focused viral testing (eg, RSV or influenza) by using rapid antigen tests. Such testing is widely available and low-cost, and results may help clinicians with management decisions and facilitate hospital cohorting.",
