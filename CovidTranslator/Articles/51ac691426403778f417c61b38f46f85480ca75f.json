Contact tracing was initiated immediately after we detected the case-patient. We communicated with the airline and bus operators to collect passenger information and undertook personal interviews in related communities. A hotline was set up, and the case-patient's travel information was published in the media. We investigated hotline callers and identified suspected contacts. We also reviewed video footage from closed circuit television in hotels and restaurants visited by the case-patient, enabling us to identify contacts and measure duration and distance of exposures. Information about bus passengers was limited; consequently, with help from police departments, we analyzed video footage recorded by public surveillance cameras at bus stations and surrounding communities and traced the whereabouts of related passengers.",

Second, the patient was symptomatic and potentially infectious during his travel and stay in China. Previous clusters have been detected in hospitals and households (11) (12) (13) , and MERS-CoV transmission might occur in enclosed settings. Moreover, because knowledge about MERS is still limited, cases could have been easily missed initially.",

We notified local health authorities about these 4 contacts. \u2020Numbers and percentages for contacts and close contacts exclude 4 contacts who left mainland China before they were identified. is another active solution for identifying contacts, especially for anonymous contacts. In our investigation, we directly located some bus passengers who resided near the station by reviewing footage from surveillance cameras. Other bus passengers left the station by private cars, which were captured by cameras. Our inquiries into car registration information traced these contacts successfully. Reviewing video footage can also measure a contact's exposure objectively and quantitatively. Investigators should combine and compare video footage meticulously to gather pieces of information.",
