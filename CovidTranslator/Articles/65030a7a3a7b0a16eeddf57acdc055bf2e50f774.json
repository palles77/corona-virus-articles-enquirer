A crude methanol extr act was pre par ed using 150 g of dried my celium and 500 mL of MeOH. The pro cess was re peated three times and the supernat ants combin ed and the solv ent was evapora ted under pre ssur e. The crude extr act was used in an antipr olifer ation assa y using a K562 ery thro leukemia cell line and was sho wn to ha ve the ability to inhibit pro lifer ation by 36%. No further testing was performed on the crude extr act and instead extr action focused on the rem aining residue from the crude MeOH extr action. The resid ue was redissolv ed in a 1:1 (v/v) mixtur e of MeOH/ H 2 O and partitioned using hexanes. The aqueous la yer was then extr acted with eth yl acetate . Eth yl acetate extr acts were concentr ated under press ure to rem ove the solv ent and a bro wn oil remained as a result. Silica gel-flash colum n chromatogr aph y elution was performed using CHCl 3 with ste pwise incre ase of the solv ent polarity .

FB1 was report ed as a white solid and was recr ystallized into a white po wder and subsequentl y la belled compound 2.

Zhang et al. first rele ased a stud y on the effects of va rious C. sinensis extr acts ag ainst the pro lifer ation of human prem yel oc ytic leukem ia cell HL-60 in 2004 . Petro leum ether , eth yl acetate , ethanol and wate r extr acts were pre par ed and subjecte d to MTT (3-(4,5-Dimeth ylthiazol-2 -yl)-2,5-diphenyltetr azolium br omide) assa y to meas ure cell pro lifer ation as well as to determine cytotoxici ty potential of the va rious extr acts on HL-60 cells. Caspase-3 activ ity as well as clea va ge of pol y ADP-ribose pol ymera se (PARP) were also anal yzed; both are char acteristic of cell apoptosis. During apoptosis, acti vati on of caspase-3 enab les the clea vage of the nucl ear enzyme , PARP , and subsequ ently pre ve nts it fro m re pairing DN A. Although all four extrac ts exhibi ted significant inhibition of cell gro wth, the eth yl acetate extr act pro ved the overwhelmin g fa vo rite with an ED 50 (median effecti ve dose; a dose requir ed for quant al effect in 50% of the populatio n) of 625 lg/mL and became the focus for the rem ainder of the stud y. The eth yl acetate extr act contin ued to impr ess by activating caspase-3 in a dose-and time-de pendent manner . This had a cascading effect of PARP as evidenced by the clea va ge of the 113 kD prote in into 89 kD fra gments. These results confirms eth yl acetate extr acted mycelium's ab ility to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells via caspase-3 mediate d PARP clea vage. Of significant inter est is the lo w ED 50 va lue obtained in this stud y which warra nts further scr eening in an attempt to identify the activ e compoun d in vo lv ed and its use as potential ther apeutic drug.
