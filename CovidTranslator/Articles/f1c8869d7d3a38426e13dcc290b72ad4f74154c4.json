            "text": "Within a decade, MERS-CoV emerged with nearly four times higher case fatality rate than an earlier outbreak of SARS-CoV and spread out in 27 countries in short span of time. As an emerging virus, combating it requires an in-depth understanding of its molecular machinery. Therefore, conformational characterization studies of coronavirus proteins are necessary to advance our knowledge of the matter for the development of antiviral therapies. In this study, MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PL pro ) was recombinantly expressed and purified. Thermal folding pathway and thermodynamic properties were characterized using dynamic multimode spectroscopy (DMS) and thermal shift assay. DMS study showed that the PL pro undergoes a single thermal transition and follows a pathway of two-state folding with T m and van't Hoff enthalpy values of 54.4 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C and 317.1 \u00b1 3.9 kJ/mol, respectively. An orthogonal technique based on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence also showed that MERS-CoV PL pro undergoes a single thermal transition and unfolds via a pathway of two-state folding with a T m value of 51.4\u00b0C. Our findings provide significant understandings of the thermodynamic and structural properties of MERS-CoV PL pro .",

            "text": "Frequent fatal coronavirus outbreaks in humans and animals have caused serious concerns in the healthcare sector, scientific community, and animal husbandry. First human outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 caused life-threatening atypical pneumonia in more than 8000 people in 26 countries with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 10% (Pillaiyar et al. 2015; Al-Tawfiq et al. 2014; WHO 2016b) . Another lethal coronavirus outbreak emerged in the Arab peninsula countries in 2012 which was caused by what is now known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) . From September 2012 to December 2016, 1864 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases of infection in 27 countries with 659 mortalities (nearly four times higher CFR than SARS-CoV) have been reported (Al-Tawfiq et al. 2016; WHO 2016a) . Coronavirus survivors after acute infections suffer from many health issues and require long-term medical assistance (Han et al. 2003; Ong et al. 2005; Chan et al. 2003; Leow et al. 2005; Siu 2016; Cha et al. 2016) . In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, at least four other pathological coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63) are continuously circulating in humans causing relatively mild respiratory conditions that may in some instances escalate to severe pathological illnesses (Mackay et al. 2012; Carbajo-Lozoya et al. 2012; Simon et al. 2007) . Coronaviruses have also caused deadly diseases in animals, leading to huge economic losses in the animal husbandry sector (Vlasova et al. 2014; Lee and Lee 2014; Sun et al. 2016) . Moreover, high mutation and recombination rates in coronaviruses allow them to cross species barriers and adapt to new hosts more easily (Denison et al. 2011; Lau and Chan 2015) .",

Tyrosine emission maximum is less sensitive to its local environment compared to tryptophan. Indole ring in the tryptophan residues undergoes two isoenergetic transitions which causes polarity sensitivity, while tyrosine undergoes through a single electronic state (Ghisaidoobe and Chung 2014) . During the course of protein unfolding, the polarity of fluorophore microenvironment changes, which in turn leads to changes in the maximum fluorescence intensity (I max ) as well as maximum fluorescence wavelength (k max ). Therefore, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission is sensitive to the tertiary structure and detects subtle protein conformational changes in solution. It has been frequently used for the characterization of protein's conformational changes under different stress conditions (Kumar et al. 2005; Xiao et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "A previous study analyzing the quaternary structure of MERS-CoV PL pro using analytical ultracentrifugation technique has shown that PL pro is found in the monomeric state (Lin et al. 2014) . MERS-CoV PL pro contains ten tyrosine and five tryptophan residues (Fig. 2a) . MERS-CoV PL pro consists of two domains: N-terminal ubiquitinlike (Ubl) domain and a catalytic core domain. The N-terminal Ubl domain consists of 62 residues and contained one a-helix, one 3 10 -helix and five b-strands. The substrate-binding region is solvent exposed and comprised of the right-hand scaffold (Lei et al. 2014) . Three tryptophan residues (W93, 243 and 303) are buried, while W187 and W190 are surface exposed (Fig. 2b) . Figure 3a shows the decrease in intrinsic fluorescence of MERS-CoV PL pro with increasing temperature. At low temperature (20\u00b0C), highest fluorescent intensity (I max ) was observed with maximum fluorescence wavelength (k max ) at 343 nm, indicating an overall localization of all five tryptophans in the partially hydrophobic environment. As the temperature increases gradually from 20 to 90\u00b0C, I max decreased with major transitions occurring between 50 and 60\u00b0C (Fig. 3a,  b) . Initially, k max increased from 343 to 344 nm when the temperature was increased from 20 to 30\u00b0C. As the temperature was increased further, a blue-shift in k max with increasing temperature was observed, indicating conformational rearrangements in different temperature regimes. The major blue-shift in k max was found between 50 and 60\u00b0C (Fig. 3c) . The 14-nm blue-shift of tryptophan fluorescence spectrum indicated that the microenvironment of the tryptophan residues is becoming more hydrophobic during thermal denaturation. MERS-CoVPL pro thermal unfolding is different from most other proteins. Commonly, protein unfolding fluorescence spectra are characterized by a long wavelength shift ''red-shift.'' But some proteins, Fig. 2 a Sequence of C-terminal His-tagged MERS-CoV PL pro showing ten Tyr and five Trp residues, which are highlighted in green and blue, respectively. Potential internal protease site is highlighted in red and His-tagged residues are underlined. b Three-dimensional structure of MERS-CoV PL pro (PDB ID: 4R3D) with the side chains of the five Trp residues being numbered and colored in blue including MERS-CoV PL pro , exhibit blue-shift upon denaturation (Slutskaya et al. 2015; Duy and Fitter 2006; Pattanaik et al. 2003) . Pig pancreatic a-amylase showed red-shifted fluorescence spectra when chemically unfolded and showed blue-shifted spectra during thermal unfolding (Duy and Fitter 2006) . Equine lysozyme first exhibits a blue-shift transition at lower temperature and red-shift above 50\u00b0C (Morozova et al. 1991) .",

To evaluate the extent of autolysis as well as the extent of irreversible thermal unfolding and aggregation, MERS-CoV PL pro (0.2 mg/mL) was incubated on a thermomixer from 20 to 70\u00b0C with 10\u00b0C intervals. Six samples were gradually heated and equilibrated at the respective temperatures for 3 min. When the desired temperatures were attained, the samples were removed, kept on ice, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove any forming aggregates. Equal volumes of the supernatant were analyzed (Fig. 5) . If MERS-CoV PL pro would undergo autolysis during the course of thermal incubation, we would expect to see the appearance of two or more bands of MERS-CoV PL pro fragments on SDS-PAGE gels or at least a decrease in the band intensity of MERS-CoV PL pro . We found that the intensity of MERS-CoV PL pro band was apparently unchanged, indicating that autolysis was not occurring during the thermal shift assays applied in this study. In another scenario, irreversible unfolding aggregates may form during thermal shift assay. If this is the case, then aggregated protein will be pelleted down upon centrifugation and band intensity would have decreased in the supernatant sample. Our result showed that the band intensity of the supernatant samples incubated from 20 to 70\u00b0C was apparently unchanged (Fig. 5) , indicating Fig. 3 Thermally induced structural changes in MERS-CoV PL pro as monitored by the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. a To monitor tryptophan fluorescence at different temperatures, MERS-CoV PL pro was slowly heated and allowed to equilibrate for 2 min at the respective temperatures.

Further increase in temperature leads to blue-shift with major changes occurring between 50 and 60\u00b0C no or insignificant aggregation occurring during thermal shift assays.",

            "text": "Information about thermal stability, unfolding pathway, and secondary structure of MERS-CoV PL pro was obtained using an orthogonal method. We employed DMS, a newly developed information-rich experimental technique, to obtain spectroscopic and thermodynamic data of melting temperature (T m ) and van't Hoff enthalpy (DH VH ) (John and Weeks 2000; Greenfield 2006; Al-Ahmady et al. 2012) . Temperature-induced secondary structural changes in MERS-CoV PL pro in the far-UV region were monitored to study thermodynamic parameters. Moreover, DMS also characterized thermal unfolding pathway and identified the number of folding intermediate species and their relative concentrations during the unfolding process (Malik et al. 2015 (Malik et al. , 2016 . MERS-CoV PL pro was gradually heated from 20 to 94\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C/min increments and far-UV CD spectra were recorded from 200 to 250 nm. Far-UV CD spectra at several wavelengths were plotted as a function of temperature (Fig. 6a) . MERS-CoV PL pro underwent a single thermal transition as a function of temperature, suggesting two-state folding. Similar transition was also observed in the thermal shift assay using fluorescence spectroscopy. In an earlier study, secondary structure content was calculated and it was found that b-sheet structure (31%) is dominant in MERS-CoV PL pro (Lin et al. 2014) . Similarly, our results showed that MERS-CoV PL pro presented a single negative minimum at *218 nm suggesting a predominant b-sheet structure as well. When MERS-CoV PL pro was gradually heated, secondary structure was lost and became irregularly disorder structure (Fig. 6b) . The relative concentrations of folded and unfolded species as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 6c . The thermal melting point (T m ) and van't Hoff enthalpy (DH VH ) of MERS-CoV PL pro calculated using Global 3 analysis software were 54.4 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C and 317.1 \u00b1 3.9 kJ/mol, respectively. The thermal melting points (T m ) of MERS-CoV PL pro calculated by thermal shift assay and DMS were found to be in close proximity, reflecting tertiary-secondary structure unfolding events, respectively. In a recent study, papainlike protease of Murine Coronavirus also underwent a single thermal transition with a T m value of *46\u00b0C (Mielech et al. 2015) . A three-dimensional model of the thermal transitions of MERS-CoV PL pro was generated using Global 3 analysis software (Fig. 6d) . A single transition is clearly evident at lower wavelengths in the far-UV spectra region.",

MERS-CoV PL pro was continuously heated from 20 to 80\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C/min and the sample was excited at 295 nm at each temperature and emission spectra at 330 and 350 nm were recorded. The ratio of 330 nm/ 350 nm was plotted as a function of temperature. The mid-point of transition was identified as the thermal melting point (T m ) Autolysis and solubility of MERS-CoV PL pro at different temperatures. MERS-CoV PL pro was incubated at different temperatures. Subsequently, MERS-CoV PL pro was cooled on ice and centrifuged to remove aggregated protein. An equal volume of each sample was analyzed on SDS-PAGE Coronavirus, indicating similarity in deubiquitinating enzyme scaffold. Next, we have planned to evaluate the effect of different factors such as pH and ionic strength on the folding, conformational stability, and protease activity of MERS-CoV PL pro . Such studies will facilitate in exploring the different stability profiles of the different conformations as well as in evaluating the environmental condition affecting higher-order structural states in an effort to develop antivirals. Dynamic multimode spectroscopy: temperature-induced structural changes in MERS-CoV PL pro plotted as a function of temperature and wavelength. a Temperature-induced structural changes in MERS-CoV PL pro at different wavelengths. Far-UV CD spectra were shown in mdeg units at selected wavelengths. Global 3 software was used for calculating thermal transitions. Single thermal transitions were found at the wavelengths between 207 and 222 nm. b Calculated far-UV CD spectra of the MERS-CoV PL pro folding species. At 20\u00b0C, MERS-CoV PL pro predominantly adopts b-sheet conformation as shown in solid line. The unfolded state of MERS-CoV PL pro is shown in dashed line with much of its structure being lost. c Calculated concentration profiles of the MERS-CoV PL pro folding species during thermal-induced unfolding process. The figure shows the relative concentrations of thermal-induced disappearance and appearance of the folded species. The relative concentration of MERS-CoV PL pro in folded state is shown in solid line and unfolded species in dashed line. d Calculated far-UV CD, wavelength, and temperature three-dimensional graph.
