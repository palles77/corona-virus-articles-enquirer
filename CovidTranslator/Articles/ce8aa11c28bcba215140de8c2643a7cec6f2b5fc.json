In reality, transmission patterns are more complex due to the presence of various social networks. One level of complexity can be accommodated by considering a community of households. Our study of transmission dynamics in a community of households emphasizes five types of reproductive numbers for the epidemic spread: household-to-household reproductive number, leaky vaccine-associated reproductive numbers, perfect vaccine reproductive number, growth rate reproductive number, and the individual reproductive number. Each of those carries different information about the transmission dynamics and the required control measures, and often some of those can be estimated from the data while others cannot. Simulations have shown that under certain scenarios there is an ordering for those reproductive numbers. We have proven a number of ordering inequalities under general assumptions about the individual infectiousness profiles. Those inequalities allow, for instance, to estimate the needed vaccine coverage and other control measures without knowing the various transmission parameters in the models. Along the way, we've also shown that in choosing between increasing vaccine efficacy and increasing coverage levels by the same factor, preference should go to efficacy.",

            "text": "Over the last few years, there has been much interest in analyzing data from SARS, past influenza pandemics, and other diseases to estimate the reproductive numbers of these infections. A practical goal in making such estimates is that reproductive numbers can be used to gauge the effort that would be required to control such infections, either by classical public health measures such as isolation and quarantine, by biological interventions such as antivirals or vaccines, or by social interventions to reduce contact. A fundamental insight from simple models of infectious disease transmission is that the critical proportion p c of transmission events that must be blocked by such measures to halt the growth of an epidemic is given by the equation 1 Here R 0 is the basic reproductive number, or the mean number of infections caused by a typical infectious case. The validity of equation 1.0.1 depends on the mass action assumptions for epidemic transmission; equation 1.0.1 is often applied to an early stage of an epidemic in a large community. We note that equation 1.0.1 is also valid under certain other assumptions besides mass action, such as no small loops and no depletion of susceptibles.",

All this makes the mass action model a convenient (and widely used) set-up for estimating the various epidemiological quantities, and for the subsequent specification of the required control measures. In reality, these mass action assumptions are violated due to the existence of complex social networks. Hence, it is possible that estimates of the effort needed to halt the growth of an epidemic are significantly biased. It would be useful to know the directions and magnitude of these biases, and to provide quantitative bounds on the required measures even though the estimates of transmission are made under models that involve simplifications of reality.",

The classic example of such a group is a household, though the notions presented here may be generalized to other, similar settings; the basic idea is that there are two levels of mixing (Ball et al. (1997) ), one local and one global. In this context, the universal role played by the reproductive number in the mass action model, both in characterizing the epidemic's dynamics and the required control measures, is no longer valid. In fact, given the two levels of mixing, there are several reproductive numbers describing the spread of an epidemic and the various control measures that can be implemented to stop it. This paper deals with those reproductive numbers and the relations between them. It is organized as follows:",

In Section 3 we present a model for the stochastic transmission dynamics in a community of households, following the one of Ball et al. (1997) ; Britton and Becker (2000) -see also House and Keeling (2008) ; Ferguson and Dodd (2007) for a treatment of related issues in a deterministic model. In Section 4 we define five reproductive numbers that arise in this context. Three of these reproductive numbers are quantities that may be measured in an emerging epidemic, while two others encapsulate the extent of control measures directed at individuals that would be required to stop the growth of such an epidemic. While all five numbers are equal in the setting of a mass-action epidemic, their magnitudes diverge in a population with a household structure. In Section 5 we note that all five are epidemic thresholds (the requirement for epidemic spread is that each of them exceeds one), but when they exceed one, their magnitudes diverge. Numerically, we show that there is in most cases a consistent ordering among them, so that the three measurable reproductive numbers provide bounds on the two relevant for control. Analytically, we demonstrate that most of these ordering relations are generally true (Theorem 1). Along the way, we also prove that in the household model, increasing the vaccine efficacy is better than scaling the vaccination coverage level by the same factor (Proposition A.2.3), with the two measures having the same effect in a mass action model. The rest of the paper deals with proving Theorem 1 (Section 6 and Appendix A), analyzing the limiting cases for the remainder of the ordering relations (Appendix B), and presenting the numerical model for computing those reproductive numbers under various assumptions on individual infectiousness profiles (Section 7). We conclude by discussing the relevance of these comparisons for public health, and in particular for estimating important quantities during emerging epidemics (Section 8).",

            "text": "Under mass-action mixing, or more generally, under the assumption of no small loops and no depletion of susceptibles, there are several known techniques for estimating the reproductive number. The available information often includes the epidemic curve (number of new cases on each day) and a known distribution w( ) for the infectious contact interval. The latter can be understood in several ways: under no depletion of susceptibles, it represents the distribution of times from appearance of one case in the epidemic curve to appearance of secondary cases caused by it, Kenah et al. (2008) ; alternatively, w(t) equals the proportion of the average individual's infectivity which falls on day t since infection. Given that information, one may estimate the effective daily reproductive number R(t), which equals the mean number of infections caused by an individual, who got infected at time (day) t -see Wallinga and Teunis (2004) . Essentially, this technique produces a local estimate of how fast the epidemic is growing on each day by attributing cases in the present to their likely infectors in the past, and then estimating how many cases are attributed to each infector on a given day. When detailed epidemic curve data are not available, or when one is interested in the average value of R(t) over some interval (t 1 , t 2 ), a special case of this approach is to estimate the exponential growth rate r of the epidemic over that interval as (2.0.2) where N(t) is the number of persons infected on day t, and then to estimate the value of R during that interval using the expression where the moment-generating function (2.0.4) These two approaches are closely related (Wallinga and Lipsitch (2007) ), converging to the same answer if R(t) remains constant during the interval for which data are analyzed.",

The appropriate definition of a \"typical\" infective in this setting is a weighted average over the groups, in which the weights are derived from the leading right eigenvector of the next generation matrix (R ij ), where R ij is defined as the expected number of secondary cases in group i caused by an infective member of group j. Using this definition, the basic reproductive number for the disease in the whole population is given by the leading eigenvalue of the matrix (R ij ). Defined in this way, R 0 = 1 still represents the threshold between an infection that can increase and one that will decline; vaccination of a fraction p c from equation 1.0.1 of members of every group in the population will scale all entries of the next generation matrix by (1\u2212 p c ) and produce R = 1.

The relative frequency of individuals in the population who live in a household of size h is \u03c0 h , with \u03a3\u03c0 h = 1. We focus on an early phase of the epidemic so that no more than one individual in a household is infected from outside, and there is no depletion of susceptible households. Individuals are homogeneous except for the size of the household they inhabit. Upon infection, individuals may become infectious immediately or after some period, and their degree of infectiousness may vary over the infectious period. While infectiousness profiles followed by different individuals can be different, they are assumed to have the same distribution. Formally, it means that a person infected t time units ago generates infectiousness of intensity I(t), where I(t) is a trajectory of some fixed stochastic process M. One can think of I(t) as the amount of pathogen shedding by an infected individual t time units after his/her getting infected; or as the risk that he/she poses to the susceptibles -see equations 3.0.7, 3.0.9. Thus I(t) is random, and its expected value is denoted by (3.0.5) The number (3.0.6) is the expected cumulative infectiousness of an infected individual. Having introduced the individual infectiousness profile, we can now describe the infectiousness hazard that an infected individual poses, both outside of his/her household and within the household.",

Note that the out-of-household hazard, given by equation 3.0.7, and the within-household hazard, given by equation 3.0.9 are proportional. This represents the assumption that the overall shape of the infectiousness curve is determined by biological (e.g. pathogen shedding, fluid production) and behavioral (e.g. amount of time spent sleeping, social contact) characteristics of the infection, and that household contacts simply get a different, but proportional, exposure to the infectious individual than outside contacts. We also note that while in-and out-of household infectiousness hazards have a similar form, the infectiousness process taking place within an infected household is quite different from the mass action (branching) process for out-ofhousehold infections, due to a fixed number of susceptibles in the household. Some insight into that process will be gained via a Sellke-type construction in Appendix A. In the meantime, let us introduce some notation to be used later.",

There is an analogous statement for epidemic dynamics in a community of households. Define the infectious contact interval distribution is a community of households as (4.5.4) where as before, \u03b2 h (t) is the expected intensity of infectiousness of a household of size h infected t time units ago -see equation 3.0.10. Again, one can apply the Euler-Lotka equation using the number of newly infected households, where households are treated as individuals, with the serial interval distribution w H (t) and the reproductive number R H . Thus infectious spead in a community of households will grow exponentially at rate r given by solution to (4.5.5) or alternatively, (4.5.6) where M w H is the moment-generating function for the density w H ( ). We note that this growth rate (which is the same as the growth rate for the number of newly infected individuals) can often be estimated well from the incidence curve. We can plug this growth rate r of the epidemic into the moment generating function for the individual infectious contact interval distribution to define Here w G ( ) is the individual infectious contact interval distribution from equation 4.5.1 and r is the solution to equation 4.5.6. Perhaps the main motivation behind this definition is that one can often have good estimates on r and w G ( ) from the data (Lipsitch et al. (2003) , Wallinga and Teunis (2004) , Mills et al. (2004) , Ferguson et al. (2005) ). The interest in this reproductive number is thus practical: it allows us to ask such questions as, if we know nothing about household structure but apply naive (well mixed) estimates to transmission in a population where households are actually important, how will this affect our estimates of R? If we calculate critical vaccine coverage based on these estimates, how wrong (and in which direction) will we be?",

R r requires knowing the total number of new infections each day, plus a reliable estimate of the infectious contact interval distribution w G ( ) (Wallinga and Lipsitch (2007) ; Wallinga and Teunis (2004) ). Of these three, only R H has a direct practical application: it represents the factor by which transmission between households must be reduced to halt epidemic spread (Becker and Dietz (1995) ; Fraser (2007)). The other two reproductive numbers, R V and R V L , cannot be directly estimated from data, but are of direct practical interest, since they are measures of the extent of effective intervention in individuals required to stop the growth of the epidemic. Under mass-action assumptions, once again, all of these are the same (except R H which is not defined in the absence of households); in reality, we would like to use measurable quantities -R H , R HI , and R r -to provide bounds on the quantities of practical interest -R V and R V L .

Upon infection, an individual remains exposed but not infectious for a latent period whose length is exponentially distributed with mean 1/u, and then becomes infectious for a period that is also exponentially distributed with mean 1 (without loss of generality). Infectiousness I(t) (see section 3) during the infectious period is constant (and can be assumed equal to 1), and is zero before and after. Thus CI G = 1 (see equation 3.0.6). External infections follow standard massaction dynamics, but we limit our consideration to the early phase of the epidemic such that new (uninfected) households are plentiful, and all secondary infections outside the household occur in households that have never before been exposed (no depletion of susceptible households).",

For instance, even if no good contact data exists for most cases, R r may be obtained by observing the exponential growth rate of the epidemic, then calculating it from the Euler-Lotka equation 4.5.7, using the individual infectious contact distribution. Several studies in the past (Lipsitch et al. (2003) , Wallinga and Teunis (2004) , Mills et al. (2004) , Ferguson et al. (2005) etc.) took that approach, using the growth rate of an epidemic along with an infectious contact interval distribution, in various ways, to estimate the reproductive number. In at least the SARS cases, the infectious contact interval distribution was derived from known contacts of brief duration, and thus may be approximately equal to the infectious contact distribution. R r appears for the real diseases we have simulated to be a close, and conservative, approximation, to R V , consistent with our findings in Figure 1 , where this was true for cases where the latent period was comparable to (or shorter than) the infectious period.",

The main idea behind this contruction appeared essentially in Sellke (1983) . We'll use two variants of the Sellke contruction, needed for our proofs: one with individual thresholds, which is more common (see Andersson and Britton (2000) , p. 14), and one with pairwise thresholds, to trace who infected whom.Let the nodes (persons) in the network be labelled as P 1 , \u2026, P N . Once infected, individual P i generates infectiousness of intensity I i (s) \u2265 0, where s is the time since P i 's infection and I i (s) is a trajectory of some stochastic process M i . The processes M i are perhaps not necessarily the same (say people in different age groups have different patterns of pathogen shedding).For a calendar time t and a person P i infected at time t i , defineGiven two individuals P i and P j , there is a transmission coefficient \u03bc ij \u2265 0 for infectious contacts between P i and P j . For a person P i initially infected at calendar time t i , the probability of P j receiving an infectious contact from P i during time (t, t + \u0394t) (conditional on P i 's particular infectiousness profile) isAppendix B.

Now, consider the extreme where within-household transmission is very high, \u03bc h \u2192\u221e. Then everyone in the household becomes infected, and a leaky vaccine will change that fact only negligibly. Thus, the only effect of a leaky vaccine is to reduce between-household transmission.
